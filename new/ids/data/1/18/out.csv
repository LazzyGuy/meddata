Unlike peptide bonds, disulphide bonds are reversible in nature allowing cleaved bonds to reform. Disulphide bonds are important structural elements that stabilise protein conformation. They can be of catalytic function found in enzymes that facilitate redox reactions in the cleavage/formation of disulphide bonds in their substrates. Emerging evidence also indicates that disulphide bonds can be of regulatory function which alter protein activity when they are cleaved or formed. This class of regulatory disulphide bonds is known as allosteric disulphide bonds. Allosteric disulphide bonds are mechano-sensitive, and stretching or twisting the sulphur-sulphur bond by mechanical force can make it easier or harder to be cleaved. This makes allosteric disulphide bonds an ideal type of mechano-sensitive switches for regulating protein functions in the vasculature where cells are continuously subjected to fluid shear force. This review will discuss the chemistry and biophysical properties of allosteric disulphide bonds and how they emerge to be mechano-sensitive switches in regulating platelet function and clot formation.",Rapidly reversible chlorophyll fluorescence quenching induced by pulses of supersaturating light in vivo.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31090015,Photosynthesis research,2019 05 15,"The saturation pulse method provides a means to distinguish between photochemical and non-photochemical quenching, based on the assumption that the former is suppressed by a saturating pulse of light (SP) and that the latter is not affected by the SP. Various types of non-photochemical quenching have been distinguished by their rates of dark relaxation in the time ranges of seconds, minutes, and hours. Here we report on a special type of non-photochemical quenching, which is rapidly induced by a pulse of high-intensity light, when PS II reaction centers are closed, and rapidly relaxes again after the pulse. This high-intensity quenching, HIQ, can be quantified by pulse-amplitude-modulation (PAM) fluorimetry (MULTI-COLOR-PAM, high sensitivity combined with high time resolution) via the quasi-instantaneous post-pulse fluorescence increase that precedes recovery of photochemical quenching in the 100-400-µs range. The HIQ amplitude increases linearly with the effective rate of quantum absorption by photosystem II, reaching about 8% of maximal fluorescence yield. It is not affected by DCMU, is stimulated by anoxic conditions, and is suppressed by energy-dependent non-photochemical quenching (NPQ). The HIQ amplitude is close to proportional to the square of maximal fluorescence yield, Fm', induced by an SP and varied by NPQ. These properties are in line with the working hypothesis of HIQ being caused by the annihilation of singlet excited chlorophyll a by triplet excited carotenoid. Significant underestimation of maximal fluorescence yield and photosystem II quantum yield in dark-acclimated samples can be avoided by use of moderate SP intensities. In physiologically healthy illuminated samples, NPQ prevents significant lowering of effective photosystem II quantum yield by HIQ, if excessive SP intensities are avoided.",Pelvic discontinuity in acetabular revisions: does CT scan overestimate it?

The overall goal of the National Institute of Health/National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke Unruptured Intracranial Aneurysms (UIA) and subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) Common Data Elements (CDE) Project was to provide common definitions and terminology for future unruptured intracranial aneurysm and SAH research.,Shaddock peels-based activated carbon as cost-saving adsorbents for efficient removal of Cr (VI) and methyl orange.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31090012,Environmental science and pollution research international,2019 05 15,"A simple and economical method was proposed to synthesize the shaddock peels-based activated carbon (SPAC) for their application as efficient sorbents to eliminate Cr (VI) and methyl orange (MO) from one-component and two-component systems. The synthesis was conducted via activation of phosphoric acid and high-temperature carbonization. The as-prepared SPAC was characterized by Brunauer-Emmett-Teller, scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, X-ray diffraction, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, among other techniques. The adsorption experiment, which used five types of fruit peel (shaddock peels, orange peels, apple peels, banana peels, and tangerine peels), indicated that shaddock peels were the optimal precursors, with the high removal efficiencies for Cr (VI) (21.2%) and MO (54.25%). The effects of various factors (e.g., initial concentration, sorbent dosage, pH values, and contact time) were systematically evaluated. For the one-component system, the maximum adsorption capacities of Cr (VI) (9.95 mg/g) and MO (94.59 mg/g) reached pH levels 2 and 3, respectively. Kinetic modeling demonstrated that the pseudo-second-order kinetic model was adopted for the one-component and two-component systems. Isotherm studies suggested that Cr (VI) and MO sorption processes in the one-component explained well the Langmuir and Freundlich models, respectively. The extended Freundlich multicomponent isotherm model was more compatible for explaining competitive adsorption in the binary component system. The adsorbed amount of Cr (VI) was markedly suppressed by MO, whereas MO adsorption was not significantly influenced owing to the existence of Cr (VI). The higher adsorption capacity of MO could be mainly attributed to the strong force acting between MO and SPAC. The findings of this study confirmed that SPAC provided a sustainable choice for cycling solid waste shaddock peels to remove hazardous contaminants.",Recovery opportunities of valuable and critical elements from WEEE treatment residues by hydrometallurgical processes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31090011,Environmental science and pollution research international,2019 05 15,"Due to the increasing demand of metals by industry and the limited availability of natural resources, the secondary supply of these elements from discarded products, such as waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE), is an important strategy for pursuing a sustainable development. Nevertheless, the complex and heterogeneous composition of this waste stream stands as one of the main drawbacks in the definition of innovative recovery processes. This study investigated the recovery potential of a multi-step leaching process to extract the strategic metals, namely precious metals and rare earth elements (REEs), from the dust produced during the industrial shredding treatment of WEEE. Using a first double-oxidative step with sulfuric acid, most rare earth elements contained in the dust were dissolved at high percentages. Moreover, around 50% of gold was extracted in a second leaching step using 0.25 M thiourea, in a solid to liquid ratio of 0.2 g/70 mL, at 600 rpm. In this regard, the optimum operating conditions were studied by a 23 full factorial design. Experimental results address the definition of a novel approach, pursuing the recovery of resources of great industrial interest from the residues originating from WEEE mechanical treatments typically performed at large scale. As this dust fraction is not sent for recovery but currently disposed, the proposed recycling strategy promotes the diversion of waste from landfill while reducing the need for virgin materials via lower-impact metallurgical processes.",The accumulation of cadmium in wheat (Triticum aestivum) as influenced by zinc oxide nanoparticles and soil moisture conditions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31090010,Environmental science and pollution research international,2019 05 15,"Both cadmium (Cd) contamination in agricultural soils and drought stress pose a serious problem for crop quality and human health. Owing to the specific physical and chemical characteristics, zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles (NPs) can be used in agriculture as a nanofertilizer but their impact on Cd accumulation in wheat (Triticum aestivum) grains under normal and limited water conditions remains insufficient. In this study, the efficiency of ZnO NPs on Cd intake by wheat was investigated under normal and water-limited conditions grown in Cd-contaminated soil for 125 days after seed sowing. The lower biomass and higher oxidative stress were observed in the tissues of the control and drought stress further decreased the plant biomass and caused oxidative stress. Zinc oxide NP treatments increased the tissue dry weight and minimized the oxidative stress either Cd stress alone or combined with drought. Drought stress enhanced the Cd contents in wheat tissues and grains, while ZnO NPs significantly reduced the Cd accumulation in tissues and grains by reducing the soil bioavailable Cd and its accumulation by roots. These findings depicted that NP application to contaminated soils can promote wheat productivity and effectively alleviate soil Cd contamination either alone or under water-limited conditions. The baseline data demonstrated in this study provide insights that pave the way towards safer wheat production under combined drought and metal stress. However, the application of NPs at field levels with numerous crops and climatic conditions needs to be investigated before final recommendation.","Air pollution, output, FDI, trade openness, and urbanization: evidence using DOLS and PDOLS cointegration techniques and causality.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31090009,Environmental science and pollution research international,2019 05 15,"Globalization has led countries to a strong interdependence among them, which is reflected in trade and capital flows. Simultaneously, in recent decades, the world is rapidly urbanizing. This dynamic has generated a process of economic growth with serious consequences for the environment, particularly in air quality. In this context, the objective of this research is to examine the causal link among carbon dioxide emissions per capita as a measure of air pollution, real per capita output, FDI, trade openness, and urbanization in 100 countries during 1980-2017. First, we used the cointegration test of Pedroni (JAMA 61:653-670, 1999) and Westerlund (JAMA 69:709-748, 2007) to find the equilibrium long and short term, respectively, and the Dumitrescu and Hurlin (JAMA 29:1450-1460, 2012) test to verify the direction of causality among the series. Second, we estimate the strength of the cointegration vector for individual countries through a dynamic ordinary least squares model (DOLS), and for country groups using a dynamic panel model with ordinary least squares (PDOLS). The results found indicate the existence of short- and long-term equilibrium among the variables globally and by groups of countries. The strength of the cointegration vector is strong in high and middle-high-income countries. At a global level, the results of the causality test suggest the existence of a unidirectional causal relationship that goes from output, urbanization, and FDI to air pollution, and a bidirectional relationship among trade and air pollution. These results are sensitive to the inclusion of the level of development of the countries. Our results suggest that the mechanisms to increase output, along with commercial and FDI flows, and urbanization are factors that play a relevant role in the determination of air pollution. Consequently, public policies should take these aspects into account in efforts to mitigate air pollution.","Identifying effects of pipe material, hydraulic condition, and water composition on elemental accumulation in pipe corrosion scales.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31090008,Environmental science and pollution research international,2019 05 15,"Identification of the accumulation mechanism of major elements on pipe surface is essential to investigate the development of corrosion scales and co-occurrence of trace inorganic contaminants. In this study, corrosion scale samples were collected from old, corroded iron pipes made of different materials and exposed to different water qualities and operation conditions. Elemental composition of these scales was determined by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). Cumulative occurrence analysis, Q-style hierarchical cluster analysis (CA), and principal component analysis (PCA) were conducted to ascertain major elements typical for corrosion scales and to estimate the dominant influencing factor to each elemental constituent. The major elements in the examined scales are Fe, C, Zn, Si, Ca, Al, and S in the descending prevalence. Their occurrences are influenced by an interactive effect. Pipe material imposes a significant effect on the accumulation of Fe, Zn, and Ca in corrosion scales; water composition can account for the presence of Si, Al, and S in this study; hydraulic condition is identified as the primary factor influencing the occurrence of C and Ca. Q-style CA and PCA are verified practicable for data interpretation and identification of dominant factors influencing scale characteristics."

Eight target SPs (i.e., tefluthrin, bifenthrin, cyhalothrin, permethrin, cyfluthrin, cypermethrin, esfenvalerate, and deltamethrin), with cypermethrin and permethrin as major components, were ubiquitously detected in both water (dissolved and particle phases, separately) and sediments. Significant increases of ΣSP (sum of eight SPs) concentrations were observed in both water and sediment from the dry period to the wet period. The spatial distribution of SPs was mostly impacted by land-use type, with the highest ΣSP concentrations in the residential areas, which indicates the massive application of pyrethroids in household mosquito control. It is demonstrated that SPs preferred to be adsorbed to the particles, and rainfall-induced runoff was suggested as an important mechanism that moved SPs to the receiving waterways. A rising trend on sediment concentrations of SPs in the Guangzhou area in the last decade implied increasing application of pyrethroid insecticides, with cypermethrin and permethrin as the dominant components, where the contamination of SPs was positively related with urbanization rate (e.g., resident population and green coverage area). A special emphasis was placed on the potential effects of both individual SPs and their mixtures in three trophic levels (i.e., algae, daphnia, and fish) using toxic units (TUs) and risk quotients (RQs) for water and sediments. In spite of no acute effects due to SPs in the sediments, the toxic units showed daphnia as the most sensitive species in water, with acute risks to daphnia exhibited in several sampling sites. The risk assessment points out that a chronic toxicity (RQ index) caused by SPs in three trophic levels (algae, daphnia, and fish) exists, especially in Daphnia magna.

Sequential extraction procedure was applied to partition the heavy metals into four fractions (soluble and exchangeable fraction (F1); carbonates, oxides, and reducible fraction (F2); bound to organic matter, oxidizable, and sulphidic fraction (F3); and residual fraction (F4)) in PM2.5 samples. The metals in each fraction were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES). Daily PM2.5 concentration ranged between 13 and 238 μg m-3 during the study period. For more than 92% of the days, the mass concentrations were greater than the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) set at 60 μg m-3. The total mass concentration of the eight metals was 3.3 μg m-3 that accounted for 2.5% of the PM2.5 mass concentration and followed the order Fe > Zn > Cu > Mn > Pb > Ni > Cd > Cr in dominance. The carcinogenic metals (Cd, Cr, Ni, and Pb) comprised 10% of the total metal determined. Almost all the metals had the highest proportion in the residual fraction (F4) except Ni, which had the highest proportion in the reducible fraction (F2). Chemical fractionation and contamination factor (CF) showed that Pb and Ni are readily mobilized and more bioavailable. Risk assessment code (RAC) showed that Cd, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb, and Zn had medium environmental risk, while Cr and Fe had low risk. When the bioavailable (F1 + F2) concentrations were applied to calculate non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic risk, the results showed that the value of hazard index (HI) for toxic metals was 1.7 for both children and adults through inhalation. The integrated carcinogenic risk was 1.8 × 10-6 for children and 7.3 × 10-6 for adults, with both values being higher than the precautionary criterion (1 × 10-6). Enrichment factor (EF) calculations showed that Cd, Pb, Zn, and Ni were enriched being contributed by anthropogenic activities carried out in the industrial sectors of the city.","Indoor phthalate concentrations in residences in Shihezi, China: implications for preschool children's exposure and risk assessment.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089994,Environmental science and pollution research international,2019 05 15,"Despite the risks associated with phthalate exposure, there are few studies emphasizing preschool children's exposure to phthalates in residences in Northwest China. In this study, seven phthalates from indoor dust samples were measured in 50 residences in Shihezi, China. Preschool children's exposure doses via non-dietary intake were calculated by Monte Carlo simulation. Risk assessment was conducted by comparing the simulated exposure dose with benchmarks for reproductive toxicity and cancer specified in Proposition 65 of California. The detection frequencies for all selected phthalates were more than 75%, with the exception of benzyl butyl phthalate (BBP) and di-n-octyl phthalate (DNOP). Bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) was the most principal compound in the dust samples (median = 455 μg/g and 462 μg/g in the bedroom and living room, respectively). The simulation displayed that the median DBP daily intake was 1.5-1.9 μg/day/kg for preschool children in Shihezi, which was considered a high level compared with similar studies around the world. The risk assessment indicated that almost all preschool children face potential reproductive risk due to dibutyl phthalate (DBP) exposure, with medians of hazard index (HI) from 9.6 to 12.4 for all age groups. Therefore, from a children's health perspective, attention should be paid to reducing indoor phthalate pollution and exposure in this area.",Heavy metal concentrations in drinking water in a country heavily reliant on desalination.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089993,Environmental science and pollution research international,2019 06 02,"Desalination is an important strategy for adapting to the global shortage in safe drinking water. Israel relies heavily on desalinated water (over 50% of supplied drinking water). However, desalinated water may be more corrosive than water from other sources and may cause leaching of heavy metals from materials in contact with water. In this study, we measured heavy metal concentrations (copper, iron, lead) in 1379 drinking water samples in educational institutions in Israel and compared heavy metal concentrations in drinking water from different sources (desalination, groundwater, desalinated and groundwater mixture). 99.9% of the samples met the standard for copper (1400 μg/l), 99.7% for iron (1000 μg/l), and 99.6% for lead (10 μg/l). As expected, heavy metal concentrations were higher in first flush samples compared to flushed samples (significant findings for lead, copper, and iron). Heavy metal concentrations were not higher in desalinated water, or desalinated and groundwater mixture, compared to groundwater. In first flush samples, lead concentrations in groundwater were significantly higher than in desalinated-groundwater mixtures (p = 0.005). In flushed samples, lead concentrations in groundwater were higher than in desalinated-groundwater mixtures but the difference was not significant (p = 0.07). We suggest that regulatory requirements for stabilization of desalinated water and restrictions on lead content of plumbing materials appear to have been effective in preventing increased exposure to lead in desalinated drinking water in Israel. Further study should focus on potential heavy metal leaching in pure desalinated water samples.",Enzyme activity and histological analysis of Clarias gariepinus fed on Imbrasia belina meal used for partial replacement of fishmeal.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089992,Fish physiology and biochemistry,2019 05 15,"An experiment was carried out to assess the effect of replacing fishmeal with mopane worm meal in the diet of Clarias gariepinus. Juvenile C. gariepinus weighing 67.04 ± 3 g were stocked in 15 rectangular concrete tanks connected to a recirculating system. Five diets denoted D1, D2, D3, D4 and D5 were formulated to replace fishmeal with mopane worm meal at 0, 10, 20, 40 and 60%. Triplicate groups of C. gariepinus were randomly assigned to each diet at a stocking density of 100 fish per tank. The fish were fed to apparent satiation twice daily for 51 days. All growth performance indices declined with higher mopane worm inclusion levels. Specific growth rate (SGR) declined from 1.85%/day in the control diet to 1.43%/day in diet 5. Protein efficiency ratio (PER) also declined from 25.27% in the control diet to 19.30% in diet 5. Apparent digestibility coefficient (ADC) followed a similar pattern declining from 92.2% in the control diet to 87.1% in diet 5. Both amylase and protease activity in the stomach increased with higher mopane worm inclusion levels. Despite the increased enzyme activity in the stomach, SGR declined. The decline in SGR was attributed to high acid detergent fibre (ADF 58.4 g/kg) and chitin in the mopane worm diets. Lipase and chitinase did not show any discernible pattern with high mopane worm inclusion levels in the stomach. In the intestines, protease, lipase and chitinase did not show any discernible pattern with high mopane worm inclusion levels. Consequently, the relationship between SGR and all these enzymes was weak. However, amylase activity declined with higher mopane worm inclusion levels in the intestines, and this resulted in decreased SGR (r2 = 0.6722). The negative effects of mopane worm meal were further confirmed by the increase in liver degradation scores at high mopane worm inclusion levels. The liver degradation score increased from 1.12 in the control to 2.46 in diet 5.",Hepatic and gastroprotective activity of Serjania marginata leaf aqueous extract in Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089991,Fish physiology and biochemistry,2019 05 15,"The aim of this study was to assess the leaf aqueous extract composition of Serjania marginata and the effects of its inclusion on the diet of Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus), with respect to the activity of digestive enzymes and enzymes associated with the metabolism of the liver and intestine and liver histopathology. Fish (initial mean weight, 54.36 ± 17.04 g) were divided into groups: fasting (without feeding), control (commercial feed), and treatment (commercial feed with leaf aqueous extract of Serjania marginata), and in each aquarium, there were five individuals and the fish fed ad libitum for 15 days. Treatment fish had ingested on average 224.3 mg of extract/kg of fish/day. In the extract analysis by mass spectrometry, quercitrin, isoquercitrin, A-type proanthocyanidin trimer, and quinic acid were identified. In the enzymatic activity, fish from the treatment group showed higher level of alkaline phosphatase, while the hepatotoxic markers (AST and ALT) and levels of lipase, amylase, and nonspecific protease did not differ (p > 0.05). In liver histopathological analysis, it was observed that fish from the treatment showed normal structure, while abnormalities were associated with control (fibrosis, loss of cordonal architecture, vacuolated hepatocytes with nucleus displaced to the periphery) and fasting (reduction in hepatocyte size and sinusoidal space). The intestine histopathology evidenced that the extract favored the development of goblet cells and intestinal fold height. The results indicated that the leaf aqueous extract of S. marginata assists in the structural maintenance of the liver and intestine and stimulates intestinal alkaline phosphatase production in Nile tilapia, suggesting that the identified compounds act on the liver and intestine, showing hepatoprotective effects and stimulating intestinal digestion.","The burden of informal caregiving in Hungary, Poland and Slovenia: results from national representative surveys.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089990,The European journal of health economics : HEPAC : health economics in prevention and care,2019 06 01,"We aimed to investigate the burden of informal care in Hungary (HU), Poland (PL) and Slovenia (SI).",Cutoff of the Zarit Burden Interview in predicting depression and anxiety.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089989,"Quality of life research : an international journal of quality of life aspects of treatment, care and rehabilitation",2019 05 15,The purpose of the present study was to determine a statistically valid cutoff score for the Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI) in order to identify family caregivers at risk for depression and anxiety to guide for further assessment and future intervention.,Responsiveness of the EQ-5D-3L and EQ-5D-5L in patients following total hip or knee replacement.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089988,"Quality of life research : an international journal of quality of life aspects of treatment, care and rehabilitation",2019 05 15,To examine the responsiveness of the EQ-5D-3L and EQ-5D-5L among total hip/knee replacement (THR/TKR) patients.,The Use of Caffeine by People with Epilepsy: the Myths and the Evidence.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089986,Current neurology and neuroscience reports,2019 05 16,"Caffeine is the most widely consumed central nervous stimulant.

The absolute oral bioavailability of apixaban is ~ 50%. Food does not have a clinically meaningful impact on the bioavailability. Apixaban exposure increases dose proportionally for oral doses up to 10 mg. Apixaban is rapidly absorbed, with maximum concentration occurring 3-4 h after oral administration, and has a half-life of approximately 12 h. Elimination occurs via multiple pathways including metabolism, biliary excretion, and direct intestinal excretion, with approximately 27% of total apixaban clearance occurring via renal excretion. The pharmacokinetics of apixaban are consistent across a broad range of patients, and apixaban has limited clinically relevant interactions with most commonly prescribed medications, allowing for fixed dosages without the need for therapeutic drug monitoring. The pharmacodynamic effect of apixaban is closely correlated with apixaban plasma concentration. This review provides a summary of the pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, biopharmaceutical, and drug-drug interaction profiles of apixaban. Additionally, the population-pharmacokinetic analyses of apixaban in both healthy subjects and in the target patient populations are discussed.",RIL-Contour: a Medical Imaging Dataset Annotation Tool for and with Deep Learning.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089974,Journal of digital imaging,2019 05 15,"Deep-learning algorithms typically fall within the domain of supervised artificial intelligence and are designed to ""learn"" from annotated data. Deep-learning models require large, diverse training datasets for optimal model convergence. The effort to curate these datasets is widely regarded as a barrier to the development of deep-learning systems. We developed RIL-Contour to accelerate medical image annotation for and with deep-learning. A major goal driving the development of the software was to create an environment which enables clinically oriented users to utilize deep-learning models to rapidly annotate medical imaging. RIL-Contour supports using fully automated deep-learning methods, semi-automated methods, and manual methods to annotate medical imaging with voxel and/or text annotations. To reduce annotation error, RIL-Contour promotes the standardization of image annotations across a dataset. RIL-Contour accelerates medical imaging annotation through the process of annotation by iterative deep learning (AID). The underlying concept of AID is to iteratively annotate, train, and utilize deep-learning models during the process of dataset annotation and model development. To enable this, RIL-Contour supports workflows in which multiple-image analysts annotate medical images, radiologists approve the annotations, and data scientists utilize these annotations to train deep-learning models. To automate the feedback loop between data scientists and image analysts, RIL-Contour provides mechanisms to enable data scientists to push deep newly trained deep-learning models to other users of the software. RIL-Contour and the AID methodology accelerate dataset annotation and model development by facilitating rapid collaboration between analysts, radiologists, and engineers.",Real-world study of afatinib in first-line or re-challenge settings for patients with EGFR mutant non-small cell lung cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089973,"Medical oncology (Northwood, London, England)",2019 05 16,"Afatinib, a second-generation epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) for mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), was approved in Japan in 2014. This study evaluated clinical outcomes of afatinib in real-world practice. Medical records of patients who received afatinib for advanced EGFR-mutant NSCLC were retrospectively reviewed. In total, 128 patients were analyzed. Seventy-six patients received afatinib as the first-line setting and 52 as the re-challenge setting (i.e., after failure of prior first-generation TKI). There was no difference in patient characteristics, such as age, sex, and PS, between the first-line and the re-challenge settings. In the first-line setting, the median progression-free survival (PFS) was 17.8 months (95% confidence interval [CI] 13.7-21.5 months). The overall survival (OS) was 39.5 months (95% CI 34.4- not reached). The response rate (RR) was 64.4%. Subset analysis indicated that patients with dose reduction showed longer PFS than those without dose reduction (18.5 months versus 7.9 months) (P = 0.016). In the re-challenge setting, the median PFS was 8.0 months (95% CI 4.9-9.5 months). The RR was 25%. Most common adverse events leading to dose modification or treatment discontinuation included diarrhea, paronychia, and oral mucositis in both settings. Interstitial lung disease occurred in 5.4% (7/128). In the real-world practice in Japan, afatinib showed comparable or better efficacy compared with that shown in previous clinical trials in both the first-line and the re-challenge settings.",Dose Escalation Study to Assess the Pharmacokinetic Parameters of a Nano-amorphous Oral Sirolimus Formulation in Healthy Volunteers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089971,European journal of drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics,2019 05 15,"Sirolimus (Rapamune®) exhibits low bioavailability, high variability and moderate food effect following oral administration. This makes therapeutic blood monitoring of sirolimus concentrations necessary for kidney transplant patients. Furthermore, reaching therapeutic blood sirolimus concentrations in renal cancer patients was found to be challenging when the marketed drug was administered alone. A novel, nano-amorphous formulation of the compound was developed and its pharmacokinetic properties were investigated in a dose escalation study in a first-in-human clinical trial.

We postulated that LDL might also promote the opsonophagocytosis of Pseudomonas aeruginosa by U937 cells since this bacterium interacts with LDL. In this study, P. aeruginosa (CMCC10104), U937 cells, and human LDL were used in phagocytosis assays to test our hypothesis. Escherichia coli strain BL21, which does not interact with LDL, was used as a negative control. Colony counting and fluorescence microscopy were used to determine the bacterial quantity in the opsonophagocytosis assays. After incubation of U937 cells and P. aeruginosa with LDL (100 µg/ml) for 15 and 30 min, phagocytosis was observed to be increased by 22.71% and 32.90%, respectively, compared to that seen in the LDL-free group. However, LDL did not increase the phagocytosis of E. coli by U937 cells. In addition, we identified CD36 as a major opsonin receptor on U937 cells, since an anti-CD36 monoclonal antibody, but not an anti-CD4 monoclonal antibody, almost completely abolished the opsonophagocytosis of P. aeruginosa by U937 cells.",Cardiovascular Disease in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes and in Patients Starting Empagliflozin Treatment: Nationwide Survey.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089969,"Diabetes therapy : research, treatment and education of diabetes and related disorders",2019 05 15,Were the participants of the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial representative of patients receiving empagliflozin in clinical practice?

However, their mechanisms are complex and remain unclear. Guan-Jie-Kang (GJK), a prescription modified from ""Wu Tou Decoction,"" was found to significantly relieve arthritis symptoms in rats with adjuvant-induced arthritis after 30-day treatment, especially in the 24 g/kg/day group. By analyzing 1749 targets related to 358 compounds in the five herbs of GJK, we identified the possible anti-arthritis pathways of GJK, including the calcium signaling and metabolic pathways. Bone damage levels were assessed by micro-computed tomography, and greater bone protective effect was observed with GJK treatment than with methotrexate. Receptor activator of nuclear factor κB ligand (RANKL)-RANK signaling, which is related to calcium signaling, was significantly regulated by GJK. Moreover, a target metabolomics assay of serum was conducted; 17 metabolic biomarkers showed significant correlations with treatment. An integrated pathway analysis revealed that pyruvate metabolism, purine metabolism, and glycolysis metabolism were significantly associated with the effects of GJK in arthritis treatment. Thus, this study establishes a new omics analytical method integrated with bioinformatics analysis for elucidating the multi-pathway mechanisms of TCM.","Quantification of Liver, Subcutaneous, and Visceral Adipose Tissues by MRI Before and After Bariatric Surgery.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089967,Obesity surgery,2019 05 15,Morbid obesity is a worldwide epidemic and is increasingly treated by bariatric surgery.

A systematic review and meta-analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089965,Journal of robotic surgery,2019 05 15,"To systematically review world literature and compare peri-operative outcome including operating time (OT), estimated blood loss (EBL), warm ischemia time (WIT), length of stay (LOS) and complications between retroperitoneal robotic assisted partial nephrectomy (RP-RAPN) and trans-peritoneal robotic assisted partial nephrectomy (TP-RAPN) for posteriorly located renal masses. All randomised trials and observational studies comparing RP-RAPN and TP-RAPN for posteriorly located renal masses were considered. The GRADE approach (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation, GRADE) was used to rate the quality of evidence. 82 potential publications were identified. 3 were included in the review. All three studies were observational comparative studies. 347 and 550 patients underwent RP-RAPN and TP-RAPN, respectively, for posteriorly located tumours. There was statistically significant difference in LOS between the 2 techniques, favouring the RP-RAPN cohort: risk ratio (M-H, random, 95% CI), - 0.42 [- 0.67, - 0.18], p < 0.0006. There was no statistically significant difference in overall complication rates between the two techniques: risk ratio (M-H, fixed, 95% CI), 0.80 [0.49, 1.30], p = 0.37. There was no statistically significant difference in ≥ Clavien 3a complication rates between the two t echniques: risk ratio (M-H, fixed, 95% CI), 1.17 [0.62, 2.19], p = 0.63. OT, EBL, WIT and positive margin rates were similar for both approaches. The quality of evidence for complications, LOS and remaining outcomes were 'moderate', 'low' and 'very low', respectively, on GRADE approach. The current review suggests that the LOS with RP-RAPN are significantly lesser than TP-RAPN for posterior tumours. The RP-RAPN does not appear to offer any advantage over TP-RAPN for other peri-operative outcomes such as WIT, OT and EBL. The surgical margin rates and morbidity between the two approaches appear to be similar.",Effect of Initial Aging and High-Fat/High-Fructose Diet on Mitochondrial Bioenergetics and Oxidative Status in Rat Brain.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089964,Molecular neurobiology,2019 05 15,"Middle age is an early stage of the aging process, during which the consumption of diets rich in saturated fats and/or simple sugars might influence brain function, but only few data are available on this issue. We therefore investigated the impact of a diet rich in saturated fat and fructose (HFF) on mitochondrial physiology in hippocampus and frontal cortex of middle-aged rats (1 year old), by including a group of adult rats (90 days) as a ""negative control,"" lacking the putative effect of aging. Middle-aged rats were fed HFF or control diet for 4 weeks. Mitochondrial function was analyzed by high-resolution respirometry and by assessing the amount of respiratory complexes. Markers of oxidative balance, as well as the protein content of uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα), were also assessed. A decrease in the activity of complex I was detected in both brain areas of middle-aged rats. In hippocampus, mitochondrial respiratory capacity and complex IV content decreased with age and increased with HFF diet. Higher protein oxidative damage, decreased antioxidant defenses, and increased UCP2 and PGC-1α content were found in hippocampus of middle-aged rats. HFF feeding induced a significant reduction in the amount of UCP2, PGC-1α, and PPARα, together with higher protein oxidative damage, in both brain areas. Overall, our results point to middle age as a condition of early brain aging for mitochondrial function, with hippocampus being an area more susceptible to metabolic impairment than frontal cortex."

Yet despite the high HIV prevalence among Black men who have sex with men (MSM), insufficient attention has been given to factors associated with those Black MSM in the United States who have never received an HIV test in their lifetime. Promoting Our Worth, Equality, & Resilience (POWER) is a cross-sectional observational study that recruited Black MSM at Black Pride events across six cities in the United States from 2014 to 2017. Participants completed an anonymous questionnaire and were offered free, confidential HIV testing. Of the 4174 Black MSM without a prior HIV diagnosis, 404 (9.68%) had never tested for HIV (mean age = 31.03 years). Lower education and greater internalized homophobia were associated with never having tested for HIV. Higher age (AOR = 1.05, 95%, 1.02-1.07) and assumption of HIV-positivity (AOR = 3.24, 95% CI 1.53-6.84) were both associated with increased odds of an HIV-positive test result (n = 119; 36%). To compare, HIV prevalence among Black MSM who had received at least one HIV test before study participation was 23%. While a minority of Black MSM had never received an HIV test, this group had a significantly higher likelihood of HIV infection. Alternative HIV testing strategies are needed to facilitate HIV testing initiation among Black MSM for whom conventional HIV testing modalities are insufficient.",Brown tumor of the thoracic spine presenting with paraplegia in a patient with peritoneal dialysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089951,CEN case reports,2019 05 15,"Secondary and tertiary hyperparathyroidism is an important problem of chronic kidney disease. Brown tumor is a benign, unusual, reactive lesion as a result of disturbed bone remodeling, from long-standing increase in parathyroid hormone level. Brown tumors may cause morbidity due to pressure symptoms on neural structures and spontaneous bone fractures. Herein, we presented a peritoneal dialysis patient with tertiary hyperparathyroidism under calcand calcitriol treatment for 4 years due to refusing of the parathyroidectomy operation. She admitted to hospital for sudden onset back pain with difficulty in gait and walking, and imaging studies showed an expansile mass lesion in the thoracic spine. She was operated for mass and diagnosed with brown tumor. After operation, she lost the ability of walking than become paraplegic and she underwent rehabilitation program. Preventive measures including calcitriol and cinacalcet may cause a modest decrease in parathyroid hormone levels but it should be remembered for the development of bone complications such as brown tumor formation in patients with moderate elevated PTH levels, especially those with tertiary hyperparathyroidism. Parathyroidectomy should be performed without delay in these cases.",Synthesis and biological evaluation of quercetin-zinc (II) complex for anti-cancer and anti-metastasis of human bladder cancer cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089950,In vitro cellular & developmental biology. Animal,2019 06 13,"Bladder cancer is the 13th leading cause of cancer death worldwide, and its mortality rate is highly associated with the motility of the malignant cells. Although the techniques of urothelial cancer treatment have been continuously advanced in the last decade, the invasive bladder cancer remains incurable and the mean survival time of the patients with high-grade malignancy after cancer relapse is still < 6 months, indicating a new strategy which can reduce bladder cancer cell motility and/or progression is urgently needed. Quercetin is a polyphenolic flavonoid with approved anti-tumor effect. However, the drawbacks of quercetin, including low absorption, extensive metabolism, and rapid elimination, severely hamper its availability in the clinic. In this study, we aim to synthesize the quercetin-zinc complex (Q-ZnCPX) and explore its anti-cancer and anti-metastasis efficacies on human bladder cancer cells in vitro. Based on the results of cell movement and protein expressions in BFTC-905 cells, we found that both cell migratability and invasiveness were markedly reduced by the Q-ZnCPX with concentration of ≥ 12.5 μM through p-AKT and MT1-MMP regulations compared to the cells without treatment (P < 0.05). Moreover, the synthesized Q-ZnCPX with ≥ 75 μM can even provide > 50% of mortality rate (P < 0.05) to the cancer cell after 24-h treatment. These results demonstrated that the synthetic Q-ZnCPX may serve as feasible tool for both anti-cancer and anti-metastasis on human bladder cancer cells dependent on the dosage.",How do Emotion Word Type and Valence Influence Language Processing? The Case of Arabic-English Bilinguals.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089949,Journal of psycholinguistic research,2019 05 15,"The current study examines the influence of word type (i.e., emotion-label vs. emotion-laden) and valence (i.e., positive vs. negative vs. neutral) on the processing of emotion words among bilinguals. To this end, three groups of Arabic-English bilinguals (n = 120 per group) completed the tasks of free recall, ratings for concreteness, imageability and context availability, and discrete word association. Two groups, representing different levels of second language (L2) exposure completed the tasks in English while the third group completed the tasks in Arabic. The results of the free recall and rating tasks generally supported the influence of word type, valence and L2 exposure on the processing of emotional content; namely, emotion-label vs. emotion-laden vs. neutral words and negative vs. positive emotion words generally behaved significantly differently, and the participants with increased L2 exposure usually outperformed the ones with less exposure. In contrast, the word association task often failed to present statistically significant findings. The results are interpreted in line with the specific nature of the Arabic mental lexicon, the existing literature, and relevant theoretical models of emotion and the bilingual mental lexicon. Directions for future research are proposed.",Cytokeratin 19 Immunostain Reduces Variability in Grading Epithelial Dysplasia of the Non-Keratinized Upper Aerodigestive Tract Mucosa.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089948,Head and neck pathology,2019 05 15,"Epithelial dysplasia (ED) grading systems are criticized for low reliability. The effects of diagnostic tests or stains on reducing examiner variability in grading ED of the upper aerodigestive tract have not been investigated. The study aim was to examine the effectiveness of cytokeratin 19 (K19) immunostain on enhancing inter and intraexaminer reliability of ED grading and to reiterate the relation of K19 positivity with epithelial keratinization. The study sample consisted of 122 paraffin blocks that fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Each paraffin block had three sections cut: one immunostained for K19 and two for hematoxylin and eosin stain (H&E). Each examiner graded the study sample in six rounds; three using H&E stain only and three using paired K19-H&E stains. The study examiners were three American-Board certified practicing oral pathologists. The results were analyzed using Krippendorff's alpha, ROC curve, Chi square test and binary logistic regression. Upon the use of paired K19-H&E stains the results showed that the intraexaminer reliability coefficients of grading were improved from 0.70, 0.69, 0.78 to 0.73, 0.88, 0.91 for examiners 1, 2, and 3 respectively. Reliability coefficients for inter-examiners improved from 0.55 to 0.73 (Krippendorff alpha). The accuracy of identifying the diseased cases (high-grade dysplasia) increased from 0.82 to 0.94 (ROC curve). Binary logistic regression revealed that K19 positivity is negatively associated with hyperkeratinization of surface epithelium (P = 0.001). To conclude, for grading non-keratinized epithelial dysplastic lesions of the upper aerodigestive tract, paired K19-H&E stains proved to reduce inter and intra-examiner variability by highlighting the extension of dysplastic epithelial cells within epithelial thickness, thus identifying the involved epithelial third and assigning a more reliable and better reproducible grade.",The relationship of blood neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio with nutrition markers and health outcomes in hemodialysis patients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089947,International urology and nephrology,2019 05 15,"Adverse outcomes in hemodialysis patients have been attributed, in part, to the pro-inflammatory state prevalent in this population.

As a consequence, much effort has focused on alternative treatment strategies in an effort to improve outcomes. The application of blood purification therapies to improve immune homeostasis has been suggested as one such method, but these approaches, such as high-volume continuous haemofiltration or cytokine and/or endotoxin removal, have enjoyed little success to date. More recently, the use of sorbent technologies has attracted much attention. These adsorbers are highly effective at removing inflammatory mediators, in particular, cytokines, from the bloodstream. This narrative review is the executive summary of meetings held throughout the 6th International Fluid Academy Days in Antwerp, Belgium (Nov 23-25, 2017), focusing on the current understanding regarding the use of such adsorbers in humans with septic shock.

Genetic diversity among different strains may be the cause of variable severity of disease in different regions of the world. To explore this genetic diversity, genome annotation by rapid annotation using subsystem technology (RAST) was carried out for genomes of four Salmonella Typhi strains from two distinct areas available in the public domain. Two clinical strains were from India (P-stx-12 and E02-1180) and the other two strains considered as reference strains were from the endemic regions of Papua New Guinea (UJ308A and UJ816A). We report that Indian clinical strains possess several similar genes responsible for virulence and pathogenicity as those present in the reference strains. Interestingly, Indian clinical strains also possess 34 additional potential virulence genes that are absent in the reference strains, suggesting the more dreadful nature of Indian clinical strains as compared to those causing endemic typhoid. Indian strains contained genes coding for; Colicin V and bacteriocin production; multidrug resistance efflux pumps; ABC transporters; Type III and Type VI secretion systems, siderophore aerobactin, pathogenicity islands and Vi polysaccharide biosynthesis and transport. These unique genes are also reported in the genomes of other six clinical strains of India analyzed through RAST and IslandViewer 4 for validation purpose. This study highlights the presence of potential genes as molecular targets to overcome the future endemic outbreaks in India.","Human sperm motility: a molecular study of mitochondrial DNA, mitochondrial transcription factor A gene and DNA fragmentation.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089917,Molecular biology reports,2019 05 15,"Alterations affecting the mitochondrial genome and chromatin integrity of spermatozoa impair male reproductive potential. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number alterations on sperm motility and on the molecular mechanism regulating the number of mtDNA copies, through analysis of mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) gene expression. It also investigated any correlation between mtDNA copy number and sperm DNA fragmentation (SDF). Sixty-three asthenozoospermic semen samples (Group A) and 63 normokinetic semen samples (Group N) were analysed according to WHO (WHO laboratory manual for the examination and processing of human semen, World Health Organization, Geneva, 2010). Sperm mtDNA copy number and TFAM gene expression were quantified by real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. SDF was evaluated using the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labelling (TUNEL) assay. The mtDNA copy number was higher in asthenozoospermic semen samples and was negatively correlated with sperm concentration, total sperm number and total motile spermatozoa. The caseload showed a global negative correlation of TFAM gene expression with total motile sperm and a positive correlation with abnormal forms, SDF and mtDNA copy number, but this was not confirmed within each subgroup. SDF was significantly increased in asthenozoospermic samples and correlated with abnormal forms. No correlation was found between SDF and mtDNA copy number. Our results suggest a potential role of mtDNA content as an indicator of semen quality and support the hypothesis that dysregulation of TFAM expression is accompanied by a qualitative impairment of spermatogenesis. Since mtDNA copy number alterations and impaired chromatin integrity could affect reproductive success, these aspects should be evaluated in relation to assisted reproductive techniques."

The resulting modified silicas were studied in depth using 29Si, 1H, and 13C solid-state NMR spectroscopy, elemental analysis, and nitrogen adsorption-desorption (BET) analysis. The obtained results reveal that the type of grafting, grafting density, and structure of the grafted species at the silica surface depend strongly on the length of organosiloxane polymer and on the nature of the ""green"" additive, DMC or DEC. The spectral changes observed by solid-state NMR spectroscopy suggest that the major products of the reaction of various organosiloxanes and their DMC or DEC mixtures with the surface are D (RR'Si(O0.5)2) and T (RSi(O0.5)3) organosiloxane units. It was found that shorter methylhydro (PMHS) and dimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and their mixtures with DMC or DEC form a denser coverage at the silica surface since SBET diminution is larger and grafting density is higher than the longest epoxymethylsiloxane (CPDMS) used for FSNs modification. Additionally, for FSNs modified with short organosiloxane PMHS/DEC and also medium organosiloxane PDMS/DMC, the dense coverage formation is accompanied by a greater reduction of isolated silanols, as shown by solid-state 29Si NMR spectroscopy, in contrast to reactions with neat organosiloxanes. The surface coverage at FSNs with the longest siloxane (CPDMS) greatly improves with the addition of DMC or DEC. The data on grafting density suggest that molecules in the attached layers of FSNs modified with short PMHS and its mixture of DMC or DEC and medium PDMS and its mixture of DMC form a ""vertical"" orientation of the grafted methylhydrosiloxane and dimethylsiloxane chains, in contrast to the reaction with PDMS/DEC and epoxide methylsiloxane in the presence of DMC or DEC, which indicates a ""horizontal"" chain orientation of the grafted methyl and epoxysiloxane molecules. This study highlights the major role of solid-state NMR spectroscopy for comprehensive characterization of solid surfaces.","A Physiological Overview of the Demands, Characteristics, and Adaptations of Highly Trained Artistic Swimmers: a Literature Review.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089903,Sports medicine - open,2019 06 10,"Artistic swimming (AS) is a very unique sport consisting of difficult artistically choreographed routines ranging in the number of athletes (one to ten: solo, duet, team, combination, highlight routine) and with elements performed quickly and precisely above, below, and on the surface of the water.

We will show that, at this region of the sample, the elastic terms of the free energy can be separated as the sum of two kinds of elastic deformations, the first is proportional to the Gaussian curvature obtained from the director field of a three-dimensional nematic sample and the second is composed by those terms that cannot be expressed as resulting from this curvature. To achieve these results we will construct the metric of an unixial nematic sample using the fact that the director gives the direction of the anisotropy of the system. With this approach we will give analytical and geometrical arguments to show that the elastic terms determined by [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] are contained in a curvature term, while the terms fixed by the splay elastic term, [Formula: see text], and the bend elastic term, [Formula: see text], are not.

The Lower Delta of the Paraná River, one of the most important wetlands in Argentina, has been profoundly altered because most of the natural environments were drained or diked to make them suitable for different agricultural activities. As a result, the landscape is characterized by a mosaic of Salicaceae afforestations of different ages interspersed with patches of secondary forests and grazing grasslands. The high susceptibility of Carabidae and Aphodiidae to natural and human-induced disturbances and management practices is reflected by changes in their spatiotemporal distribution. We performed a 1-year study to analyze and compare beetle's communities inhabiting different habitat types in this modified wetland landscape. A total of 58 beetle species were recorded, of which 48 were carabids and 10 aphodids. Although species richness and diversity were higher in productive habitats (afforestations and grasslands) than in secondary forests, hydrophilic species were only found in the latter. Community parameters varied seasonally. Our results indicate a close relationship between wetland beetle communities and vegetation cover in each habitat type. Human activity increases heterogeneity across this landscape, which favors the colonization of new species but causes the loss or displacement of autochthonous species. The secondary forests could serve as alternative habitats for beetles typical of humid environments. We propose the maintenance of the current heterogeneous mosaic to favor the diversity of ground beetles and the implementation of changes in water management for the benefit of hydrophilic beetle species.",Horizontal ridge augmentation using xenogenous bone graft-systematic review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089897,Oral and maxillofacial surgery,2019 05 15,"This study aimed to perform a systematic review about the use of xenogenous bonegraft in horizontal ridge augmentation to answer the following question: In implant patients, treated with xenografts for horizontal ridge augmentation, what would be the outcomes in terms of bone gain, bone resorption, implant survival, and complication rates?",A radiologic evaluation of the incidence and morphology of maxillary sinus septa in Japanese dentate maxillae.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089896,Oral and maxillofacial surgery,2019 06 10,"Evaluation of the inner aspect of the maxillary sinus is important for the success of a sinus lift procedure.

Therefore, we became interested in the role of the Nlrp3 inflammasome in this process and show for the first time that its activation in ATP-dependent manner orchestrates BM egress of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) as well as other stem cells, including mesenchymal stroma cells (MSCs), endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), and very small embryonic-like stem cells (VSELs). To explain this extracellular ATP is a potent activator of the Nrlp3 inflammasome, which leads to the release of interleukin 1β and interleukin 18, as well as several danger-associated molecular pattern molecules (DAMPs) that activate the mannan-binding lectin (MBL) pathway of the ComC, from cells of the innate immunity network. In support of this mechanism, we demonstrate that the Nlrp3 inflammasome become activated in innate immunity cells by granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) and AMD3100 in an ATP-dependent manner. Moreover, administration of the Nlrp3 inflammasome activator nigericin induces mobilization in mice, and the opposite effect is obtained by administration of an Nlrp3 inhibitor (MCC950) to mice mobilized by G-CSF or AMD3100. In summary, our results further support the crucial role of innate immunity, BM sterile inflammation, and novel role of the ATP-Nlrp3-ComC axis in the egress of stem cells into PB.",Staphylococcus aureus colonization and chronic hand eczema: a multicenter clinical trial.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089879,Archives of dermatological research,2019 05 15,"Chronic hand eczema is a common chronic inflammatory skin disease that influences public health. Staphylococcus aureus colonization plays important roles in chronic hand eczema morbidity and progression, which also correlated to chronicity and severity of the disease. In this multicenter clinical trial, we aim to investigate the relationship between S. aureus colonization and chronic hand eczema. Eighty patient volunteers diagnosed with chronic hand eczema in 4 hospitals from 4 cities participated in this study. Staphylococcus aureus colonization was determined using Polymerase Chain Reaction and fluorescent labeling probe to rapidly detect the endemic thermostable nuclease gene nuc of S. aureus in clinical samples. All patients were treated with Halometasone Triclosan Cream for 2 weeks. The changes of clinical symptom scores were observed during the follow-up time. We found that the severity of chronic hand eczema was related to S. aureus colonization. Chronic hand eczema would remain severer than others if S. aureus colonization was not eliminated. Eliminating S. aureus colonization could provide good effectiveness in treatment of chronic hand eczema. Therefore, we make a proposal that detection and treatment of S. aureus should be considered in the clinical treatment of chronic hand eczema.","Significant reduction in the expression of interleukins-17A, 22 and 23A, forkhead box p3 and interferon gamma delineates lichen planus pigmentosus from lichen planus.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089878,Archives of dermatological research,2019 05 15,"Recent studies have noticed significant role of interleukin (IL)-17, 22, 23, Foxp3, interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and Wnt5a in oral and cutaneous lichen planus (LP).

Our data suggest that individuals with AA are at a higher risk of developing insulin resistance. This may be due to common inflammatory pathogenesis or a shared genetic background.","The incidence, associated factors, and predictive nomogram for early death in stage IV colorectal cancer.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089875,International journal of colorectal disease,2019 06 14,The purpose of the present study was to investigate the incidence and associated factors for early death in stage IV colorectal cancer (CRC) and to construct the predictive nomogram.,Rectus sheath catheters-a novel approach to perioperative analgesia for colorectal surgery in an enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocol: a case series.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089874,International journal of colorectal disease,2019 06 14,Opioids have played a critical role in the management of perioperative pain following abdominal surgery.

The aim of this study was to investigate the predictive value of the quantitative power Doppler (PD) signal assessment in the subchondral bone region of the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint in patients with RA showing radiographic progression of the hand by comparing with those of previously reported scoring systems. Twenty-two patients (20 women) with RA who underwent power Doppler ultrasonography (PDUS) of the bilateral one to five MCP joints at baseline were included in the study. Radiography of both hands was performed at baseline and at 1 year. PDUS of the synovial space was evaluated according to semi-quantitative scoring (0-3) and quantitative measurement (0-100%). The PD signal in the subchondral bone region was qualitatively (0, 1) and quantitatively (mm2) assessed. The performance of PDUS assessment was compared using the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and the risk ratio (RR). As a predictor for radiographic progression, the quantitative PD signal assessment in the subchondral bone region (AUC = 0.842, p < 0.01) was equivalent to quantitative vascularity (AUC = 0.817, p < 0.05) and semi-quantitative scoring (AUC = 0.754, p < 0.05). As for the RR of the PD signal in the subchondral bone region for radiographic progression, the quantitative PD signal assessment was 5.40 (p < 0.01), whereas the qualitative PD signal assessment was 1.60 (p = 0.204).

Studies demonstrate that productive failure prepares students for later learning of new, related knowledge. Our study explored the effectiveness of productive failure as an instructional intervention in health professions education with respect to (a) acquisition and application of a novel concept, and (b) learners' preparation for future learning of new, related content. Forty year-one students enrolled in the Doctor of Pharmacy program at the University of Toronto were randomly assigned to a productive failure (i.e. attempt to generate solutions before receiving instruction) or direct instruction only learning condition. After a practice phase, participants completed a series of tests designed to measure knowledge acquisition, knowledge application, and preparation for future learning (new learning is required for successful problem solving). As expected, no difference in performance was seen between participants on the acquisition and application tests. However, participants in the productive failure condition outperformed those in the direct instruction condition on the preparation for future learning test. These results emphasize the role of struggle in learning and support the theory that engaging students in solving problems that are beyond their abilities can be a productive exercise in failure. The results suggest that productive failure assists learners in acquiring the conceptual knowledge needed to facilitate learning in the future.",The Voices that Accompany Me.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089855,The Journal of medical humanities,2019 05 15,"This essay begins with a metaphor describing who enters the field of humanities in medicine and healthcare and the types of work they do.

Wistar rats were subjected to low (12 m/min) or high (18 m/min) exercise intensity on horizontal treadmill (30 min/day, 7 consecutive days) that corresponds to ~ 40 and 70% of maximal aerobic speed, respectively. Animals treated with scopolamine to induce memory impairment were subjected to novel object recognition test to assess potential improvement in cognitive function. Expressions of BDNF, phosphorylated TrkB receptors, synaptophysin (a marker of synaptogenesis), c-fos (a neuronal activity marker) and phosphorylated endothelial nitric oxide synthase (a cerebral blood flow marker) were measured in prefrontal cortex and hippocampus of different groups of rats. In terms of cognition, our data reported that only the most intense exercise improves memory performance. Our data also revealed that BDNF pathway is dependent on intensity modality of exercise with a gradual effect in hippocampus whereas only the highest intensity leads to this pathway activation in prefrontal cortex. Our study revealed that memory improvement through BDNF pathway activation is dependent on exercise intensity. While reporting that our protocol is sufficient to improve cognition in animals with impaired memory, our data suggest that prefrontal cortex is possibly a more suitable structure than hippocampus when neuroplastic markers are used to mirror potential improvement in memory performance.","The motor cortex of the sheep: laminar organization, projections and diffusion tensor imaging of the intracranial pyramidal and extrapyramidal tracts.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089853,Brain structure & function,2019 06 13,"The laminar organization of the motor cortex of the sheep and other large domestic herbivores received scarce attention and is generally considered homologous to that of rodents and primates.

The thickness of the cortex resulted comparable to that of other terrestrial Cetartiodactyls (but thicker than in marine Cetartiodactyls of similar body mass). The laminar organization showed marked development of layer 1, virtual absence of layer 4, and image analysis suggested prevalence of large irregular neural cells in the deeper layers. Diffusion tensor imaging revealed robust projections from the motor cortex to the pyramids in the brainstem, and well evident tracts descending to the tegmentum of the mesencephalon and dorsal pons.

The ability of the dioxygenase-expressing bacteria, Rhodococcus sp. strain L4, to degrade NDMA after induction with cumene was examined in the presence and absence of its potential precursors. Dimethylamine (DMA), aniline (AN) and humic acid (HA) were selected as the precursors. The induced bacteria were able to degrade NDMA from initial concentrations ranging between 1 and 10 mg L-1 to an undetectable level (< 0.24 µg L-1) while there was no degradation of NDMA by the corresponding non-induced strain. The specific first-order degradation rate of NDMA ranged from 0.337 to 0.426 μg g-protein-1 h-1. Successful removal of all precursors was achieved by the induced bacteria. The presence of DMA had no negative effect on NDMA degradation. In contrast, a lag period was observed for the degradation of NDMA when AN or HA was present (except for the presence of 0.1 mg L-1 AN). In the presence of all precursors, NDMA degradation was negatively affected by the increased concentration (from 1 to 10 mg L-1) of all precursors.",Plasma concentrations of secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI) differ depending on etiology and severity in community-onset bloodstream infection.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089838,European journal of clinical microbiology & infectious diseases : official publication of the European Society of Clinical Microbiology,2019 05 15,"The severity of bloodstream infections (BSI) depends on pathogen, source, and host factors.

In human, 13 distinct septins genes are classified in four groups. Filaments formed by septins are complex and usually involve members of each group in specific positions. Expression data from GTEx database, a publicly available expression database with thousands of samples derived from multiple human tissues, was used to evaluate the expression of septins. The brain is noticeably a hotspot for septin expression where few genes contribute to a large portion of septin transcript pool. Co-expression data between septins suggests two predominant specific complexes in brain tissues and one filament in other tissues. SEPT3 and SEPT5 are two genes highly expressed in the brain and with a strong co-expression in all brain tissues. Additional analysis shows that the expression of these two genes is highly variable between individuals, but significantly dependent on the individual's age. Age-dependent decrease of expression from those two septins involved in synapses reinforces their possible link with cognitive decay and neurodegenerative diseases associated with aging. Analysis of enrichment of Gene Ontology terms from lists of genes consistently co-expressed with septins suggests participation in diverse biological processes, pointing out some novel roles for septins. Interestingly, we observed strong consistency of some of these terms with experimentally described roles of septins. Coordination of septins expression with genes involved in DNA repair and cell cycle control may provide insights for previously described links between septins and cancer.",Prevalence and risk factors for abdominal wall hernia in the general Russian population.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089836,Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,2019 05 15,To find out the prevalence and risk factors for abdominal wall hernias in the general Russian population.,"Primary inguinal hernia: systematic review and Bayesian network meta-analysis comparing open, laparoscopic transabdominal preperitoneal, totally extraperitoneal, and robotic preperitoneal repair.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089835,Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,2019 05 15,"The Open Lichtenstein technique, the Laparoscopic Trans-Abdominal PrePeritoneal (TAPP), the Totally Extra Peritoneal (TEP), and the robotic TAPP (rTAPP) are commonly performed.

Our search resulted in 191 unique miRNAs across 35 human studies measuring miRNA levels in blood, serum or plasma. 30 miRNAs replicated in more than one study. Most miRNAs targeted neuroplasticity and neurodevelopment pathways. Various limitations do not allow us to make firm conclusions on clinical potential of studied miRNAs.

Here, we found that hydrogen could alleviate the hippocampus-dependent spatial learning and memory deficit in lithium-pilocarpine model of status epilepticus in rats, as evidenced by the results in Morris water maze test. Hydrogen treatment downregulated the expression of necroptosis-related proteins, such as MLKL, phosphorylated-MLKL, and RIPK3 in hippocampus, and further protected neurons and astrocytes from necroptosis which was here first verified to occur in status epilepticus. Hydrogen also protected cells from apoptosis, which was indicated by the decreased cleaved-Caspase 3 expression. Meanwhile, Iba1+ microglial activation by status epilepticus was reduced by hydrogen treatment. These findings confirm the utility of hydrogen treatment in averting cell death including necroptosis and alleviating cognitive deficits caused by status epilepticus. Therefore, hydrogen may provide a potential and powerful clinical treatment for status epilepticus-related cognitive deficits.",Influence of ABCB1 polymorphisms on the pharmacokinetics and toxicity of lenalidomide in patients with multiple myeloma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089832,"Medical oncology (Northwood, London, England)",2019 05 16,"Individual diversity in plasma concentrations of lenalidomide occurs despite dosage modifications based on creatinine clearance (CCr), which can lead to unexpected toxicity. We have previously identified a cutoff value of area under the concentration-time curve (AUC0-24) for lenalidomide to avoid severe toxicity. Here, we investigated the association between ABCB1 polymorphisms and pharmacokinetics of lenalidomide in patients with multiple myeloma (MM) treated with lenalidomide and dexamethasone. Plasma concentrations of lenalidomide were analyzed using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Genotyping for ABCB1 1236C>T, 2677G>A/T, and 3435C>T polymorphisms was performed, and the effects of ABCB1 polymorphisms on AUC0-24 for lenalidomide were compared in 36 patients with MM who were administered lenalidomide according to the drug label based on CCr. Genotyping analysis showed that although there were no differences in AUC0-24 in 1236C>T and 2677G>A/T polymorphisms.

Multivariate logistic analysis confirmed the significance of T allele of ABCB1 3435C>T as a factor due to which the AUC0-24 cutoff value was exceeded (hazard ratio of 15.0, p = 0.019).

The rest of the individuals in a colony are reproductively suppressed and much research has been focussed on elucidating that mechanism. The dopamine system and prolactin have recently been implicated in the suppression of reproduction of subordinate NMRs. To investigate the changes in prolactin during the removal of an aged reproductive female (queen) and succession of a new queen, blood samples were collected during different stages of queen removal: before queen removal, after separation, but in olfactory contact with the queen and after the total removal of the queen. Further, plasma cortisol and testosterone concentrations were determined. The colony appeared unstable prior to queen removal as indicated by high concentrations of cortisol and testosterone and lack of successful breeding. A new queen succeeded the old queen whilst she was still in olfactory contact. The time preceding queen succession was characterised by high levels of aggression, the death of a number of individuals, high cortisol and testosterone and low prolactin concentrations. Once the older queen was removed entirely and the new queen had given birth, prolactin concentrations increased and cortisol and testosterone concentrations decreased in subordinate NMRs. The results suggest that low prolactin levels are associated with low reproductive suppression during times of colony instability due to the removal or death of a queen.",Randomized controlled trial on immunomodulatory effects of azithromycin in children with steroid-dependent nephrotic syndrome.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089818,"Pediatric nephrology (Berlin, Germany)",2019 05 15,Azithromycin (AZM) is a macrolide antibiotic with anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects.

Descriptors such as the van der Waals (vdW) energy, the number of hydrogen bonds, and the radial distribution function were considered. It was found that the type of functional group on the nanotube is a key influence on the vdW interaction energy between a drug molecule and a nanotube. In addition, the positions of the functional groups on a nanotube are a key influence on the adsorption of drug molecules on its surface. Our study indicated that the adsorption of STZ on CNT/FCNTs involves a partial π-π interaction and hydrogen bonding, whereas SF and STB are adsorbed on CNT/FCNTs through π-π stacking and hydrogen bonding. Our results suggest that altering the functionalization of the nanotube surface can affect the drug-nanotube interaction.

Such abnormalities may represent the substrate for an arrhythmogenic risk that could materialize the following specific drug exposure. In this work, we decided to assess basal-corrected QT interval and dispersion (QTc and QTcd) for estimating such risk in a sample of drug-free adolescents with diagnosis of BPD. In this cross-sectional comparative study, we recruited n = 70 female adolescent BPD (14.7 ± 1.3 years), free of medications, alcohol or recreational drugs. Furthermore, n = 70 matched female healthy controls (CTRL, 14.6 ± 1.5 years) were enrolled. QTc and QTcd were manually assessed on a standard 12-lead ECG by a single experienced investigator who was unaware of clinical outcomes. QTcd was increased by 7 ms on average in BPD vs. CTRL (+ 18%, p = 0.03). QTc was decreased by about 15 ms on average in BPD vs. CTRL (p = 0.003). A mild correlation was found between QTc and QTcd in BPD (r = 0.25, p = 0.03) that was not present in CTRL. No correlation was found between either QTc or QTcd, and age in both groups. Mildly increased QTcd characterizes the cardiac activity regardless of drug exposure in female adolescents with BPD. This information may be of value to clinicians striving to use neuroleptic and antidepressant drugs with a lower risk of QTcd increase.",Quantum-chemical simulation of the adsorption-induced reduction of strength of siloxane bonds.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089813,Journal of molecular modeling,2019 05 20,"Mechanical strength of silicate glasses is known to decrease markedly due to the adsorption of molecules from the environment, especially in aqueous alkali solutions. This effect, known as the adsorption-induced reduction of strength (AIRS), has not yet been fully understood. Here, the dependence on the chemical nature and electronic properties of adsorbates of the AIRS of siloxane bonds in silica was studied by means of quantum-chemical calculations at the wB97X-D3/def2-TZVP level of theory. A siloxane bond was modelled by H3Si-O-SiH3 and (HO)3Si-O-Si(OH)3 clusters, and the AIRS was simulated by a linear tensile deformation of the siloxane bond in the presence of the following adsorbates: OH-, Cl-, H2O, H+ and H3O+. Potential energy profiles and derivative force curves of the siloxane bond rupture were obtained. The varying effect of the adsorbates on the energy-force characteristics of the AIRS can be explained by changes in the bond lengths and electron occupancy. It is shown that the AIRS of the siloxane bonds increases with an increase in the nucleophilicity of the adsorbates, and correlates with an adsorbate-induced redistribution of electron density.",c-Myc induced the regulation of long non-coding RNA RHPN1-AS1 on breast cancer cell proliferation via inhibiting P53.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089812,Molecular genetics and genomics : MGG,2019 05 15,"The global burden of breast cancer has been increasing, the mechanism of which is related to multifactorial accumulation of gene mutations. Dysregulation of long noncoding RNA (LncRNA) has been linked to multiple kinds of tumorigenesis. We aimed to identify functionally relevant targets of RHPN1 Antisense RNA 1 (RHPN1-AS1) in breast cancer using breast cancer cell line-based model. Quantitative RT-PCR revealed higher expression levels of RHPN1-AS1 in human breast cancer tissues and cell line MCF-7. RHPN1-AS1 was also located in MCF-7 cells by fluorescence in situ hybridization and western blot assays. Knockdown of RHPN1-AS1 delivered by lentivirus system inhibited MCF-7 cell proliferation indicated by the cell proliferation and colony formation assays, and the knockdown of RHPN1-AS1 enhanced P53 protein expression in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. In addition, luciferase reporter assay validated that RHPN1-AS1 is a molecular sponge of miR-4261, and direct transcriptional target of c-Myc. RHPN1-AS1 exerts tumorigenesis by regulating P53 expression via MDM2 gene. These findings provide insights into the role and mechanism of action of lncRNA RHPN-AS1 in breast cancer.",Performance evaluation of 3 serodiagnostic peptide epitopes and the derived multi-epitope peptide OvNMP-48 for detection of Onchocerca volvulus infection.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089811,Parasitology research,2019 05 15,"Current diagnostic tools to determine infection with the helminth parasite Onchocerca volvulus have limited performance characteristics. In previous studies, a proteome-wide screen was conducted to identify linear epitopes in this parasite's proteome, resulting in the discovery of 1110 antigenic peptide fragments. Here, we investigated three of these peptides using peptide ELISA's and evaluated their sensitivity and specificity. Epitope mapping was performed, and peptides were constructed that contained only the minimal epitope, flanked by a linker. Investigation of the performance of these minimal epitope peptides demonstrated that all three of them have a specificity (as defined by lack of response in non-helminth-infected individuals) of 100%, low cross-reactivity (5.6%, 5.6%, and 9.3%, respectively), but low sensitivity (36.9%, 46.5%, and 41.2%, respectively). Some cross-reactivity was observed in samples from individuals infected with soil-transmitted helminths or Brugia malayi. Combining these three minimal epitopes in a single peptide, called OvNMP-48, resulted in a performance that exceeded the sum of the individual epitopes, with a sensitivity of 76.0%, a specificity of 97.4%, and a cross-reactivity of 11.1%. Cross-reactivity was observed in some STH and Brugia malayi-infected individuals. This work opens the opportunity to start exploring how these novel linear epitope markers might become part of the O. volvulus diagnostic toolbox."

Novel therapeutic concepts like bi- or multivalent antibodies may require different diagnostic approaches. In this context, multiplexed immunohistochemistry (IHC) in combination with digital image analysis offers a wide range of application possibilities.Many therapeutics currently tested in early clinical phases or preclinical development aim at the modulation of the immune response to the tumor. The respective diagnostic procedures have to address questions, e.g. regarding the spatial relationship of target and effector cells or the presence and ratio of certain cell subpopulations. These questions are also increasingly raised by the more classical therapeutics, such as monoclonal antibodies or antibody-drug conjugates.While it is hard to identify the same or adjacent cells in serial sections, multiplexed IHC assays combine oligoparametric analysis and cellular context. Establishment and validation of such assays is more complex than for common single-plex procedures with regard to specificity, accuracy and precision. Digital image analysis algorithms as an emerging tool for standardized evaluation of (multiplexed) IHC assays need to be set up in parallel with the wet lab procedures.This article focusses on the potential new role for multiplexed in situ assays in a yet-to-be-established precision pathology as a discipline of precision oncology.",The OmpA Gene of Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. glycines is Involved in Pathogenesis of Pustule Disease on Soybean.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089795,Current microbiology,2019 06 10,"The goal of this study was to elucidate the role of the outer membrane protein A (ompA) gene of Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. glycines in bacterial pustule pathogenesis of soybean. An ompA mutant of X. axonopodis pv. glycines KU-P-SW005 was shown to significantly decrease cellulase, pectate lyase, and polysaccharide production. The production of these proteins in the ompA mutant was approximately five times lower than that of the wildtype. The ompA mutant also exhibited modified biofilm development. More importantly, the mutant reduced disease severity to the soybean. Ten days after inoculation, the virulence rating of the susceptible soybean cv. SJ4 inoculated with the ompA mutant was 11.23%, compared with 87.98% for the complemented ompA mutant. Production of cellulase, pectate lyase, polysaccharide was restored, biofilm, and pustule numbers were restored in the complemented ompA mutant that did not differ from the wild type. Taken together, these data suggest that OmpA-mediated invasion plays an important role in protein secretion during pathogenesis to soybean.",Assessment of chronic renal injury in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia in the chronic phase receiving tyrosine kinase inhibitors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089794,Annals of hematology,2019 05 15,"We aimed to evaluate the incidence of chronic renal injury in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia in the chronic phase (CML-CP) receiving tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and to identify the associated factors. Data for CML-CP patients with normal estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) at baseline and receiving TKI therapy ≥ 3 months were retrospectively reviewed. The CRAE (chronic renal adverse event, defined as a 30% eGFR reduction from baseline or eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2 ≥ 90 days whichever occurred first)-free survival rates at 3 years in the imatinib cohort (n = 360) were significantly lower than those in the nilotinib cohort (n = 100) (55% versus 77%, P = 0.001) as a first-line TKI therapy. In multivariate analyses, imatinib, male sex, increasing age, and previous non-TKI treatment were associated with poor CRAE-free survival. In newly diagnosed patients who received imatinib treatment (n = 40), 24-h urine protein levels significantly increased after 6 months, and urinary β2-microglobulin values significantly increased compared to those in the nilotinib cohort (n =15) at 36 months (P = 0.042) and 42 months (P = 0.039). There was no significant difference in CRAE-free survival rates at 3 years between the nilotinib (n = 65) and dasatinib (n = 74) cohorts (67% versus 83%, P = 0.832) as second- or third-line TKI therapies. In multivariate analyses, previous non-TKI treatment was associated with poor CRAE-free survival. We concluded that imatinib was significantly correlated to chronic renal injury, possibly associated with glomerulus and renal tubular injury, compared with nilotinib as a first-line TKI therapy in CML-CP patients. However, nilotinib and dasatinib had similar mild adverse impacts on renal function as second- or third-line therapies.",Risk factors predicting graft-versus-host disease and relapse-free survival after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089793,Annals of hematology,2019 05 15,"Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is still considered a definitive curative modality for refractory or relapsed non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). However, transplant-related morbidity and mortality remain a considerable challenge. The graft-versus-host disease (GVHD)-free with relapse-free survival (GRFS) rate and GRFS-related prognostic factors have not been fully examined for NHL alone. We evaluated 104 consecutive patients with refractory or relapsed aggressive NHL receiving allo-HSCT at a single institution. With a median follow-up of 31.5 months, the estimated 3-year overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), the cumulative incidence rates of relapse, and non-relapse mortality were 45.9%, 45.9%, 36.0%, and 17.0%, respectively. The patients with overall grades III-IV acute GVHD had markedly inferior OS and DFS (p = 0.040 for OS and p = 0.028 for DFS). However, patients with more than mild stage chronic GVHD showed superior OS and DFS (p = 0.004 and p = 0.008, respectively). The 1- and 3-year GRFS rates were 44.5% and 36.9%, respectively. The negative bone marrow involvement at diagnosis, chemosensitive disease status, and fewer exposure lines of chemotherapy before transplantation significantly increased the GRFS incidence. However, no transplant-associated factors were related to GRFS incidence. Furthermore, applying dynamic GRFS method which excepted patients whose chronic GVHD was fully resolved within short-period, survival rate significantly increased over time (36.9% vs. 41.9%, p = 0.045 for conventional GRFS vs. dynamic GRFS at 3 years after transplantation). In conclusion, these results suggest that GRFS is also a useful endpoint to assess transplant outcomes, and the dynamic GRFS calculation, including rapidly manageable chronic GVHD, is a more practical method for patients with refractory or relapsed heterogenous subtypes of NHL.",Return to sport after surgical treatment for high-grade (Rockwood III-VI) acromioclavicular dislocation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089792,"Knee surgery, sports traumatology, arthroscopy : official journal of the ESSKA",2019 05 15,"Acromioclavicular (AC) joint dislocations are common in a young and active population, especially in people performing contact sports.

Alisol B 23-acetate, one of the abundant triterpenes in ZX, was used as the marker of quality control for ZX in Chinese Pharmacopoeia, while it could not reflect the lipid-lowering effect because other triterpenes in ZX also had prominent medicinal efficacy. To identify the significantly bioactive triterpenes in ZX, a multiple reaction monitoring (MRM)-based characteristic chemical profile (CCP)-support vector machine (SVM) model was used to explore the relationship between triterpenes and lipid-lowering effect of ZX. Firstly, the content of 87 targeted triterpenes was quantified by the MRM-based CCP using UHPLC-QTRAP-MS/MS. Secondly, the lipid-lowering effect of 30 ZX samples was assessed by 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. Thirdly, 9 of the 87 triterpenes possessing high mean impact value were identified to have significant lipid-lowering effect via the particle swarm-optimized SVM model. The new SVM model constructed by the 9 triterpenes showed good prediction performance and the overall prediction accuracy reached 81.94%. Finally, the real activity of these triterpenes was partly confirmed and was consistent with the prediction of SVM. These results showed that the method for discovery of triterpenes with prominent lipid-lowering activity in ZX was reliable. The proposed method is expected to provide an efficient and rapid approach for screening of active component and drug discovery in traditional herbs. Graphical abstract."

Natriuretic peptides are especially useful for this purpose and should be measured in all patients presenting with acute onset dyspnea.

Importantly, in patients treated with an angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI), NT-proBNP (or MR-proANP) should be used instead of BNP, since the latter is increased by ARNI treatment. Besides their established diagnostic value in heart failure patients, the measurement of natriuretic peptides provides prognostic information and may help in guiding therapy.

The mitogenome of S. insectorum RCEF 264 was 31,454 bp in length, containing typical fungal mitochondrial genes plus rnpB. Four group I introns interrupted rnl and cox1. Phylogenetic analyses confirmed the placement of S. insectorum RCEF 264 in Ophiostomatales. Comparison of mitogenomes among seven Ophiostomatales species revealed conserved gene contents and a high synteny, although there were also some differences among them. Their mitogenomes showed more than two-fold variations (26.6-65.1 kb) in size, with a total of 37 intron insertional loci from 11 genes (1-25 introns per species). The sole intron shared by all species was an rps3-encoding intron in rnl (mL2450), and this intron-based phylogeny was highly consistent with those constructed using mitochondrial/nuclear genes, suggesting convergent evolution of this intron with Ophiostomatales species. The dendrogram based on presence/absence patterns at all intron loci was quite different from those based on mitochondrial/nuclear genes.

Several studies have revealed the versatile and critical functions of cathepsins. Here, we obtained ten kinds of cathepsin homologs and identified seven homologs with complete coding sequences. Phylogenetic analysis verified their identities and supported the classification of cathepsins into seven families, which is similar to other vertebrates. Tissue-specific expression analysis showed that all lamprey cathepsins (L-cathepsins) are present in the supraneural body (SB), kidney, gill, intestine, brain, heart, and liver, but their relative abundance varied among tissues. Additionally, we focused on the lamprey cathepsin L (L-cathepsin L) and used recombinant L-cathepsin L protein (rL-cathepsin L) to prepare anti rL-cathepsin L polyclonal antibodies, which were used to detect its distribution in lamprey tissues. The L-cathepsin L protein was primarily detected in the SB, kidney, gill, intestine, brain, and liver via western blot and immunohistochemistry assays. Importantly, quantitative real-time PCR (RT-PCR) revealed that the expression level of L-cathepsins mRNA significantly increased after exposure to three different stimuli (poly I:C, Staphylococcus aureus (S.a) and Vibro anguilarum (V.an)). This suggested that L-cathepsins may participate in defense processes. These results revealed that L-cathepsins may play key roles in the immune response to exogenous stimuli. The findings provide important information for future studies aiming to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the immune response to pathogen invasion in lamprey."

Randomized clinical trials with human subjects consuming dairy products fortified with phytosterols, FAs, vitamins or minerals and relating this consumption with cardiometabolic health were included in this review. Risk of bias assessment according to Cochrane guidelines was performed to determine the quality of the trials. Forty-one studies were finally selected for this synthesis; the selected studies tested dairy products fortified with the following nutrients and bioactive components: phytosterols (n = 31), FAs (n = 8), and vitamin D (n = 2). We found that the consumption of phytosterol-fortified dairy, led to an overall LDL cholesterol reduction of -0.36 (-0.41, -0.31) mmol/L, P < 0.001; this decrease was mainly related to the dosage. Likewise, consumption of ω-3 FA-fortified dairy products resulted in a plasma LDL cholesterol reduction of -0.18 (-0.27, -0.09) mmol/L as well as a decrease of -0.18 (-0.32, -0.05) mmol/L in triacylglycerols (TG). Performing meta-analyses of the consumption of dairy products fortified with vitamin D or FAs other than ω-3 FAs and biomarkers of cardiometabolic risk was not possible because of the few available publications. Our results indicate that consumption of dairy products fortified with phytosterols and ω-3 FAs can lead to a reduction of LDL cholesterol and consumption of fortified dairy products fortified with ω-3 FAs can reduce TG concentration. However, more studies with homogeneous designs are needed to determine the advantages of using dairy products as fortification vehicles to prevent cardiometabolic risk.",Milk and Dairy Product Consumption and Risk of Mortality: An Overview of Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089743,"Advances in nutrition (Bethesda, Md.)",2019 06 10,"The effect of dairy product consumption on health has received substantial attention in the last decade. However, a number of prospective cohort studies have shown contradictory results, which causes uncertainty about the effects of dairy products on health. We conducted an overview of existing systematic reviews and meta-analyses to examine the association between dairy product consumption and all-cause mortality risk. A literature search was conducted in MEDLINE (via PubMed), EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Database of Systematic Reviews, and the Web of Science databases from their inception to April, 2018. We evaluated the risk of bias of each study included using the AMSTAR 2 tool. The risk ratios (RRs) for each meta-analysis were displayed in a forest plot for dose-response and for high compared with low dairy consumption. The initial search retrieved 2154 articles; a total of 8 meta-analyses were finally included after applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The number of included studies in each meta-analysis ranged from 6 to 26 cohort studies, which reported data from 6-28 populations. The sample sizes varied across studies from 24,466 participants reporting 5092 mortality cases to 938,817 participants reporting 126,759 mortality cases. After assessing the risk of bias, 25% of the studies were categorized as acceptable, 25% as good, and 50% as very good. The RRs reported by the meta-analyses ranged from 0.96 to 1.01 per 200 g/d of dairy product consumption (including total, high-fat, low-fat, and fermented dairy products), from 0.99 to 1.01 per 200-244 g/d of milk consumption, and from 0.99 to 1.03 per 10-50 g/d of cheese consumption. The RR per 50 g/d of yogurt consumption was 0.97 (95% CI: 0.85, 1.11). In conclusion, dairy product consumption is not associated with risk of all-cause mortality. This study was registered in PROSPERO as CRD42018091856.","Introduction and Executive Summary of the Supplement, Role of Milk and Dairy Products in Health and Prevention of Noncommunicable Chronic Diseases: A Series of Systematic Reviews.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089742,"Advances in nutrition (Bethesda, Md.)",2019 06 10,"Milk and dairy products contain multiple nutrients and contribute significantly to meet the nutritional requirements for protein, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, zinc, selenium, vitamin A, riboflavin, vitamin B-12, and pantothenic acid. However, consumption of dairy is decreasing and moving away from the advised level in many countries and the potential benefits of milk and dairy products for health have come under question. This, in spite that numerous studies report health benefits associated with dairy consumption. The present supplement aims to assess and summarize scientific evidence regarding the impact of dairy intake on health and all-cause mortality, and on the prevention of diverse chronic diseases, mainly from meta-analyses of observational studies and randomized controlled trials (RCTs). There seem to positive associations between moderate maternal milk intake during pregnancy and infant birth weight, length and bone mineral content during childhood. Moreover, consumption of dairy products in older subjects may reduce the risk of frailty and decrease the risk for sarcopenia. The highest consumption of dairy products did not show a clear association with total osteoporotic fracture and hip fracture risk; however, a diminished risk of vertebral fracture was found. Analysis of the differences between high and low dairy consumption and for dose-response found no association between dairy product consumption and risk of all-cause mortality. Total and low-fat dairy consumption is associated with a reduced risk of developing metabolic syndrome and current evidence supports that consumption of dairy does not adversely affect the risk of cardiovascular outcomes and may even have a subtle protective effect. Moreover, evidence has been provided of an inverse association between the consumption of dairy products and ischemic heart disease and myocardial infarction. Also, the evidence suggests that dairy consumption, particularly low-fat dairy and yogurt is associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes. Likewise, moderate compared with medium consumption of dairy is associated lower risk for colorectal and bladder cancer and has no association with prostate cancer. Finally, consumption of milk or dairy products did not show a proinflammatory effect on healthy subjects, overweight/obese individuals, or individuals with other metabolic abnormalities, and fortification of dairy products with phytosterols and ω-3 fatty acids seems to be a good approach to improve cardiometabolic risk biomarkers. In conclusion, the systematic reviews and meta-analyses of the present supplement support adequate milk consumption at various stages of life and in the prevention/control of various noncommunicable chronic diseases.",Milk and Dairy Product Consumption and Prostate Cancer Risk and Mortality: An Overview of Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089741,"Advances in nutrition (Bethesda, Md.)",2019 06 10,"Milk and dairy product consumption has been associated with an increase in prostate cancer risk; however, discrepancies have been observed in the literature. This first overview of systematic reviews and meta-analyses was carried out with the main objective of compiling and discussing the evidence generated to date related to milk and dairy product consumption and prostate cancer risk and mortality. A systematic search in MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and the Web of Science (from inception to 30 April 2018) was conducted. The inclusion criteria were as follows: adult men, meta-analyses of longitudinal studies, dairy product consumption, and risk of prostate cancer or related outcomes. The AMSTAR2 checklist was used to evaluate methodological quality. The synthesis methods included dairy product exposure (high compared with low consumption or dose-response), dairy product type (total dairy products, milk, cheese, yogurt, and others), and prostate cancer outcomes (total, nonadvanced, and advanced prostate cancer and mortality) displayed in forest plots. Six meta-analyses were identified. These studies reported on the analysis of the 2 to 32 cohorts (up to 848,395 subjects/38,107 cases; 4-28 y of follow-up) and 2 case-control meta-analyses (12,435 subjects). The meta-analysis quality was valued as mostly ""good"" according to the AMSTAR2 criteria. All RRs of high compared with low consumption (dose-response) for total prostate cancer ranged from 1.68 to 1.09 (1.07 per 400 g/d) for total dairy products, 1.50 to 0.92 (1.06 to 0.98 per 200 g/d) for milk (whole, low-fat, and skim milk considered separately), and 1.18 to 0.74 (1.10 per 50 g/d) for cheese. RRs have decreased since the first meta-analysis. Statistical heterogeneity generates uncertainty in the observed results (up to I2 = 77.1%). In conclusion, although there are some data indicating that higher consumption of dairy products could increase the risk of prostate cancer, the evidence is not consistent.

The aim of our study was to update the evidence regarding dairy intake, osteoporotic fracture (OF) risk, and prospective bone mass density (BMD) evolution assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry in Europeans and non-Hispanic whites from North America. A systematic search was conducted in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Scopus for papers published from 1 January, 2000 to 30 April, 2018. The eligibility criteria were as follows: healthy adults; measurable dairy exposure; hip, vertebral, wrist or OF as outcomes; and cohort or case-control studies. Two independent investigators conducted the search and the data extraction. A pooled analysis was conducted with random-effects models. Publication bias and meta-regression were considered. Ten cohort studies relating to OF risk were selected for meta-analysis. Three papers reporting BMD changes associated with dairy intake could not be aggregated in the meta-analysis. The pooled HRs of the highest compared with the lowest levels of dairy intake were 0.95 (95% CI: 0.87, 1.03; I2 = 82.9%; P-heterogeneity < 0.001) for OF at any site; 0.87 (95% CI: 0.75, 1.01; I2 = 86.7%; P-heterogeneity < 0.001) for hip fractures; and 0.82 (95% CI: 0.68, 0.99; I2 = 0.0%; P-heterogeneity = 0.512) for vertebral fractures. Concerning BMD, the selected studies described a 1.7-3% lower hip BMD in young and postmenopausal women with poor intake of milk in their youth, a positive relationship between baseline milk ingestion and the percentage of trochanter BMD change in elderly people, and a positive correlation between milk consumption and BMD change at the radius in women aged >65 y. In conclusion, in the studied population, the highest consumption of dairy products did not show a clear association with the total OF or hip fracture risks; however, a diminished risk of vertebral fracture could be described. The results regarding BMD change were heterogeneous and did not allow for a definitive conclusion.",Effects of Milk and Dairy Product Consumption on Pregnancy and Lactation Outcomes: A Systematic Review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089739,"Advances in nutrition (Bethesda, Md.)",2019 06 10,"Pregnancy and lactation are considered critical periods in a female's life. Thus, the maternal diet must provide sufficient energy and nutrients to meet the mother's higher than usual requirements as well as the needs of the growing fetus. The maternal diet must enable the mother to provide stores of nutrients required for adequate fetal development, and good health and quality of life in infancy and later adulthood. Among the food and beverage groups, milk and dairy products can play a very important role in achieving these targets due to their high nutrient density and bioavailability, as well as their availability and widespread consumption. The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of maternal milk and dairy consumption on pregnancy and lactation outcomes in healthy women. This report mainly focuses on the effects of the mother's intake of dairy products on infant birth weight and length, fetal femur length, head circumference, gestational weight gain, preterm birth, spontaneous abortion, breast milk consumption, and human milk nutritional value. A systematic review of available studies published up to May 2018 was conducted. A preliminary broad search of the literature yielded 5,695 citations. Four of the investigators independently selected studies for inclusion according to predefined eligibility criteria. Thirty-seven full-text articles were evaluated for potential inclusion, and 17 studies were finally included. Six were prospective cohort studies, 3 were intervention studies, 3 were retrospective cohort studies, 3 were cross-sectional studies, and 2 were case-control studies. Although the number and types of studies prevent definite conclusions, there appears to be a trend that maternal milk intake during pregnancy is positively associated with infant birth weight and length. The lack of studies prevents any conclusions being drawn related to preterm deliveries, spontaneous abortion, and lactation.",Effects of Dairy Product Consumption on Height and Bone Mineral Content in Children: A Systematic Review of Controlled Trials.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089738,"Advances in nutrition (Bethesda, Md.)",2019 06 10,"There is a physiological basis for the roles of selected nutrients, especially proteins, calcium, and vitamin D, in growth and development, which are at a maximum during the pediatric period. Milk and dairy products are particularly rich in this group of nutrients. The present systematic review summarizes the available evidence relating dairy product intake with linear growth and bone mineral content in childhood and adolescence. A search was conducted in the MEDLINE (via PubMed) and SCOPUS databases following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and included intervention-controlled clinical trials with dairy products in children from 1 January, 1926 to 30 June, 2018. The risk of bias for each study was assessed using the Cochrane methodology. The number of study participants, the type of study and doses, the major outcomes, and the key results of the 13 articles included in the review are reported. The present systematic review shows that supplementing the usual diet with dairy products significantly increases bone mineral content during childhood.

This meta-analysis of 26 cohort and case-control studies has been conducted to pool the risk of the association between milk and dairy products and bladder cancer. A systematic search in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Web of Science (from inception to 30 April 2018) was conducted. Random-effects models were used to compute pooled estimates of RR for high or medium compared with low consumption of milk and dairy. Sensitivity analyses were conducted. Subgroup analyses were performed based on type of dairy, gender, geographic location, and type of study design. Random-effects meta-regression was used to evaluate other confounding factors. Overall, medium compared with low consumption was associated with lower pooled risk of bladder cancer for total dairy products (RR = 0.90; 95% CI: 0.81, 0.98), milk (RR = 0.90; 95% CI: 0.82, 0.98), and fermented dairy products (RR = 0.87; 95% CI: 0.79, 0.96). The inverse association for milk consumption was stronger in Asians (RR = 0.79; 95% CI: 0.59, 0.98) and in cohort design studies (RR = 0.85; 95% CI: 0.71, 0.99). Moreover, high compared with low consumption was significantly associated with a lower pooled risk for milk (RR = 0.89; 95% CI: 0.81, 0.98) and fermented dairy products (RR = 0.78; 95% CI: 0.61, 0.94). However, high compared with low consumption of whole milk was significantly associated with a higher risk (RR = 1.21; 95% CI: 1.04, 1.38). The statistical heterogeneity was considerable. In conclusion, the present meta-analysis suggests a decreased risk of bladder cancer associated with medium consumption of total dairy products and with medium and high consumption of milk and fermented dairy products. An increased risk of bladder cancer was observed with high consumption of whole milk. Interpretations of the results should be made with caution.

Since then, new studies evaluating not only total dairy but also different subtypes have been published in this field. The objective of the present work was to systematically review and meta-analyze the epidemiologic studies regarding the associations between the consumption of total dairy products and subtypes (milk, yogurt, and cheese) and the incidence of MetS. Relevant studies were identified through Medline and Cochrane databases. Eligible studies were prospective cohort studies that examined the association between dairy product consumption and/or different subtypes of dairy and the risk of MetS. Random-effects or fixed-effects models were assigned to calculate the pooled RR estimates with 95% CIs. From the 2994 identified articles, 12 and 11 studies were included for the qualitative and quantitative synthesis, respectively. After comparing the highest with the lowest categories, total dairy product consumption was inversely associated with the risk of MetS (9 study comparisons; RR: 0.73; 95% CI: 0.64, 0.83). Low-fat dairy and total yogurt consumption were inversely associated with the risk of MetS (low-fat dairy: 2 study comparisons; RR: 0.77; 95% CI: 0.65, 0.91; total yogurt consumption: 4 study comparisons; RR: 0.74; 95% CI: 0.66, 0.82). The linear RR per 1 serving of yogurt/d was 0.77 (95% CI: 0.60, 1.00). Low-fat yogurt and whole-fat yogurt were inversely associated with the risk of MetS (low-fat yogurt: 2 study comparisons; RR: 0.72; 95% CI: 0.62, 0.84; whole-fat yogurt: 2 study comparisons; RR: 0.81; 95% CI: 0.70, 0.94). Total milk consumption was inversely associated with the risk of MetS (6 study comparisons; RR: 0.79; 95% CI: 0.64, 0.97). Whole-fat dairy consumption was not associated with MetS risk. Our findings suggest that the consumption of total and low-fat dairy products, milk, and yogurt is inversely associated with the risk of MetS.

Previously, it was demonstrated that various microRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in osteogenesis and regulate the complex process of osteogenic differentiation. However, it remains unclear how miRNA expression changes during Foxc1-promoted osteogenic differentiation. In this study, we successfully overexpressed the Foxc1 gene in MC3T3-E1 cells and investigated the alterations in the miRNA expression profile on day 3 after osteogenic induction by using a miRNA microarray. Nine downregulated miRNAs and eight upregulated miRNAs were found to be differentially expressed. Among these miRNAs, miR-103-3p was consistently downregulated in the Foxc1-overexpressing MC3T3-E1 cells and was identified as a negative regulator of osteogenic differentiation by using a gain- and lose-of-function assay. The special AT-rich sequence-binding protein 2 (Satb2), a pivotal osteogenic transcription factor, was identified as the miR-103-3p targeting gene and was verified by real-time polymerase chain reaction, western blot analysis, and luciferase assay. Overexpression of miR-103-3p markedly inhibited the expression of Satb2 and attenuated Foxc1-promoted osteogenic differentiation. Taken together, our results elucidated the miRNA expression profiles of MC3T3-E1 cells in the early stage of Foxc1-promoted osteogenic differentiation and suggested that miR-103-3p acts as a negative regulator of the osteogenic differentiation of MC3T3-E1 cells by directly targeting Satb2.",UNCERTAINTY OF MEASUREMENT IN THE RESPONSE TEST OF A THYROID MONITOR.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089717,Radiation protection dosimetry,2019 05 15,"A test device consisting of an I-131 source, a phantom on a 3D moving table, and a NaI(Tl) scintillation detector on a fixed flat table was developed to carry out response tests of a thyroid monitor.

Since the human exposures to NORMs is an unavoidable phenomenon, in such a way that they can easily find their way to human being via food chain, detailed knowledge on their presence in foodstuffs is necessary to assess the radiation dose to the population. Thus, the present study concerns the assessment of natural radioactivity in maize, a staple foodstuff for Nigerian, via HPGe gamma-ray spectrometry. Activity concentrations (Bq/kg) in the maize samples were found to be in the range of 6.1 ± 0.6-8.2 ± 1.3, 2.2 ± 0.4-5.1 ± 0.7 and 288 ± 16-401 ± 24 for 226Ra, 232Th and 40K, respectively. Measured data for 226Ra and 232Th show below the world average values of 67 Bq/kg and 82 Bq/kg, respectively, while the activity of 40K exceeds the global average of 310 Bq/kg. The annual effective dose via the maize consumption was found to be far below the UNSCEAR recommended ingestion dose limit of 290 μSv/y, and the estimated lifetime cancer risk show lower than the ICRP (1991) cancer risk factor of 2.5 × 10-3 based on the additional annual dose limit of 1 mSv for general public, thus pose no adverse health risk to the Nigerian populace.",Insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA binding protein 2 promotes aerobic glycolysis and cell proliferation in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma via stabilizing GLUT1 mRNA.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089713,Acta biochimica et biophysica Sinica,2019 05 15,"Insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA binding protein 2 (IGF2BP2) is a member of the IGF2BP protein family consisting of IGF2BP1~3 with the capacity of binding to many transcripts and regulating RNA stability, localization, and translation.

IGF2BP2 protein was gradually elevated from normal pancreas, pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia to PDAC in an LSL-KrasG12D/+;LSL-Trp53R172H/+;Pdx1-Cre mouse model. Furthermore, we demonstrated that IGF2BP2 promoted aerobic glycolysis and PDAC cell proliferation through directly binding to and stabilizing GLUT1 mRNA. In summary, our study unveiled an important role of IGF2BP2 in PDAC development by modulating aerobic glycolysis and as a potential therapeutic target for PDAC treatment."

In this sense, we previously showed that RcsA is necessary for colanic acid synthesis in Escherichia coli K92. Here, using an E. coli K92ΔrcsA mutant lacking rcsA gene we further characterize the implications of RcsA on E. coli K92 survival under osmotic and oxidative stressful conditions, and bacterial attachment and biofilm formation on both biotic and abiotic surfaces. Our results show that RcsA protects E. coli K92 against osmotic and, especially, oxidative stress at low temperatures. In addition, RcsA did not interfere in biofilm formation in any surface tested, including polystyrene, stainless steel, silicone, Teflon, aluminum and glass.

However, genetic mouse models in combination with novel neuron-controlling chemogenetic and optogenetic technologies have also uncovered additional functions for this Arc NPY population that go beyond the simple food intake stimulatory action and link these NPY neurons to the control of energy expenditure, thermogenesis, physical activity, food-seeking behavior, and anxiety. This control is achieved by complex neuronal networks connecting these Arc NPY neurons with other vital neuronal centers in the brain, including the paraventricular nucleus, ventral tegmental area, amygdala, and brainstem. In addition, single-cell sequencing approaches have revealed that a greater heterogeneity of NPY neurons actually exists, giving rise to various subsets of NPY neuronal populations that are distinguished by the profile of other neurotransmitters that they coexpress.

The insufficient specificity and sensitivity of biomarkers is still a key clinical hindrance for GI cancer diagnosis and successful treatment. The emergence of `precision medicine', `basket trial' and `field cancerization' concepts calls for an urgent need and importance for the understanding of how organ system cancers occur at the molecular levels. Knowledge from both the literature and data available in public databases is informative in elucidating the molecular alterations underlying GI cancer. Currently, most available cancer databases have not offered a comprehensive discovery of gene-disease associations, molecular alterations and clinical information by integrated text mining and data mining in GI cancer. We develop GIDB, a panoptic knowledge database that attempts to automate the curation of molecular signatures using natural language processing approaches and multidimensional analyses. GIDB covers information on 8730 genes with both literature and data supporting evidence, 248 miRNAs, 58 lncRNAs, 320 copy number variations, 49 fusion genes and 2381 semantic networks. It presents a comprehensive database, not only in parallelizing supporting evidence and data integration for signatures associated with GI cancer but also in providing the timeline feature of major molecular discoveries. It highlights the most comprehensive overview, research hotspots and the development of historical knowledge of genes in GI cancer. Furthermore, GIDB characterizes genomic abnormalities in multilevel analysis, including simple somatic mutations, gene expression, DNA methylation and prognosis. GIDB offers a user-friendly interface and two customizable online tools (Heatmap and Network) for experimental researchers and clinicians to explore data and help them shorten the learning curve and broaden the scope of knowledge. More importantly, GIDB is an ongoing research project that will continue to be updated and improve the automated method for reducing manual work.",The plant Mediator complex and its role in jasmonate signaling.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089685,Journal of experimental botany,2019 05 15,"The Mediator complex is an essential, multisubunit, transcriptional coactivator that is highly conserved in eukaryotes. Mediator interacts with gene-specific transcription factors, the RNA polymerase II transcriptional machinery as well as several other factors involved in transcription, and acts as an integral hub to regulate various aspects of transcription. Recent studies of the plant Mediator complex have established that it functions in diverse aspects of plant development and fitness. Jasmonate (JA) is an oxylipin-derived plant hormone that regulates plant immunity and development. The basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor MYC2, which is a master regulator of JA signaling, orchestrates genome-wide transcriptional reprogramming of plant cells to coordinate defense- and growth-related processes. Here, we review the function of the plant Mediator complex in regulating JA signaling. We focus on the multifunctional Mediator subunit MED25, which emerges as an integrative hub for the transcriptional regulation of jasmonate signaling."

Herein, we successfully prepared Bi@C nanoparticles with a suitable size and high output (3.14 g per patch) through a one-pot hydrothermal method. By combining Bi with carbon, the optical absorption in the NIR-II range was enhanced compared to that for single carbon; moreover, Bi@C could no longer be easily oxidized due to the protection of outer C compared with individual Bi. Furthermore, because of the high atomic number of Bi (Z = 83), the Bi@C nanoparticles exhibited computed imaging contrast properties. According to the in vitro and in vivo experiments, the Bi@C nanoparticles could ablate cancer cells under illumination with a 1064 nm laser with deeper penetration and an appropriate permissible exposure (MPE) to the laser (1 W cm-2), showing excellent performance for the diagnosis and treatment of tumors. This study provides a simple method to synthesize metal-carbon nanocomposites to enhance the NIR-II optical absorption efficiency for effective deep-seated tumor photothermal therapy and will further broaden the applications of CNMs.",Overview on the spatial-temporal characteristics of the ozone formation regime in China.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089656,Environmental science. Processes & impacts,2019 05 22,"Ozone (O3), a main component in photochemical smog, is a secondary pollutant formed through complex photochemical reactions involving nitrogen oxides (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). In the past few decades, with the rapid economic development, industrialization and urbanization, the mixing ratio of O3 has increased substantially in China. O3 non-attainment days have been frequently observed. Despite great efforts made in the past few years, it is still difficult to alleviate O3 pollution in China, due to its non-linear relationship with the precursors. In view of the severe situation in China, this study presents a comprehensive review on the spatial-temporal variations of the relationship between O3 and its precursors (i.e. O3 formation regime), built upon the previous reviews of the spatial-temporal variations of O3 and its precursor levels. Valuable findings from previous studies are laid out for a better understanding of O3 pollution, followed by implications for the control of O3 pollution. This literature review indicates that O3 formation in most areas of the North China Plain (NCP), Yangtze River Delta (YRD) and Pearl River Delta (PRD) regions is in a VOC-limited regime during the high-O3 seasons due to dramatic emissions from human activities in cities. Outside these metropolitan areas, a NOx-limited regime dominates rural/remote areas. From summer to winter, the O3 formation regime over China shows a tendency to shift to a VOC-limited regime. Furthermore, O3 formation in China shifted toward increasing sensitivity to VOC emissions before the 12th Five-Year-Plan. However, after the 12th Five-Year-Plan, successful reduction of NOx slowed down this trend. Further effective control of VOCs is expected to achieve sustained O3 attainment in the future. To timely solve the current O3 pollution problem, precise control of O3 precursors is proposed, together with the joint prevention and control of regional air pollution.",Integrating ultrathin and modified NiCoAl-layered double-hydroxide nanosheets with N-doped reduced graphene oxide for high-performance all-solid-state supercapacitors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089655,Nanoscale,2019 05 23,"As one class of important electroactive materials, layered double-hydroxide (LDH) nanostructures show great promise for application in the fields of electrocatalysis, secondary batteries, and supercapacitors. Nonetheless, the synthesis of ultrathin multi-metallic-based LDH nanosheets or related nanohybrids (NHs) remains a challenge, and their supercapacitive performances need to be further improved for achieving both high energy and high power densities. Herein, ultrathin and modified NiCoAl-LDH (m-LDH) nanosheets and N-doped reduced graphene oxide (NRG) NHs were synthesized by an alkaline etching of pre-synthesized ultrathin NiCoAl-LDH nanosheets, followed by electrostatic assembly with NRG. The alkaline etching could efficiently modulate the chemical states of the active Ni/Co elements and create more oxygen vacancies in the m-LDH nanosheets. After integrating m-LDH with NRG, the strong interaction or efficient electronic coupling of those two constituents further mediated the surface electronic structure of the m-LDH nanosheets, improving the interfacial charge transport and offering more available electrochemical active sites for surface faradaic reactions. Thus, the obtained m-LDH/NRG NHs manifested greatly enhanced specific capacitance (1877.0 F g-1 at 1 A g-1), which was superior to that of pure m-LDH and most other reported electrode materials. Moreover, using such NHs as the positive electrode and activated carbon as the negative electrode, a fabricated asymmetric all-solid-state supercapacitor device delivered a high energy density of 19.9 W h kg-1 at a power density of 319.8 W kg-1 together with good cycling stability (76.5% capacitance retention after over 5000 cycles). Remarkably, even at a power density up to 1637.5 W kg-1, it could still retain an energy density of 13.1 W h kg-1, superior to recently reported asymmetric supercapacitors devices based on Ni, Co, and other transition metal compounds.",Addressable activated cascade DNA sequential logic circuit model for processing identical input molecules.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089654,"Chemical communications (Cambridge, England)",2019 06 13,"Herein, we propose the state and activation mechanisms able to realize the unification of an input signal and addressable sequential execution.

Here we present the synthesis and characterization of core-multishell Nd3+-doped nanoparticles displaying excellent optical properties. We systematically studied the influence of doping concentration, nanostructure design, excitation wavelength and size effect on the upconversion luminescence of Nd3+-doped nanoparticles. Remarkably, the emission intensity of optimized nanoparticles with 808 nm excitation is three times higher than the emission intensity of those with 980 nm excitation. Surprisingly, the optical profiles of Nd3+-doped nanoparticles strongly depend on the excitation wavelengths. The dominant effect responsible for the emission intensity difference and the energy transfer mechanism upon different excitation wavelengths are investigated. Interestingly, the heavily Nd3+-doped nanoparticles not only display efficient upconversion luminescence, but also are able to convert the excitation source to heat under a single 808 nm excitation source. Importantly, these efforts will lead to Nd3+-doped nanoparticles with unprecedented optical and thermal properties that will have broad utility in fundamental research and technological applications.",Protective effects of polysaccharides from Cordyceps gunnii mycelia against cyclophosphamide-induced immunosuppression to TLR4/TRAF6/NF-κB signalling in BALB/c mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089650,Food & function,2019 05 15,"Polysaccharides are closely associated with immune regulation. In this study, the aim was to investigate the effect of polysaccharides from Cordyceps gunnii mycelia (PPS) in cyclophosphamide (CTX)-induced immunodeficient mice. Compared with the CTX-induced immunosuppressed mice, the spleen and thymus indexes in mice with orally administered PPS were significantly increased, body weight loss was alleviated, and the natural killer (NK) cytotoxicity and proliferative activities of the lymphocytes were elevated. The recovery of peripheral white blood cells, red blood cells, hemoglobins and platelets was accelerated. Furthermore, the results from ELISA showed that PPS could up-regulate the serum levels of IL-2, IL-12, IFN-γ and IgG, and reduce the level of TGF-β. Histopathological analysis of the spleen revealed the protective effect of PPS against CTX-induced immunosuppression. Western blotting results showed that PPS possessed immunomodulatory activity via TLR4/TRAF6/NF-κB signalling pathways. Finally, the intestinal absorption of PPS was poor, as detected in the Caco-2 transwell system. Taken together, these findings suggest that PPS plays a crucial role in protection against immunosuppression in cyclophosphamide-treated mice and could be a potential candidate for use in immune therapy regimens.",Photonic actuators with predefined shapes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089649,Nanoscale,2019 05 23,"Developing actuators with multi-responsibility, large deformation, and predefined shapes is critical for the application of actuators in the field of artificial intelligence. Herein, we report the preparation of a new type of unimorph actuators containing phenol-formaldelyde resin (PFR) and graphene oxide (GO) using the chiral nematic structure of cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) as the template. The so-obtained PFR/GO films have a unimorph structure with an asymmetric distribution of GO across the film. They exhibit synchronous responses of both photonic properties and actuation to humidifying/dehumidifying. Moreover, PFR/GO films can be forged into desired shapes by aldehyde treatment, and thereby are able to produce complex movements. In addition, the objects with predetermined shapes show good shape recovery capability upon many wetting-drying cycles, especially through the treatment with formaldehyde. A mechanism model for shape predetermination by aldehyde treatment is suggested based on experimental details. By further designing the predetermined shapes and patterns, such PFR/GO actuators may hold great promise for smart actuation devices of highly complex movements.",Extract of ice plant (Mesembryanthemum crystallinum) ameliorates hyperglycemia and modulates the gut microbiota composition in type 2 diabetic Goto-Kakizaki rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089648,Food & function,2019 05 15,"Ice plant (Mesembryanthemum crystallinum) extract (IPE) is a rich source of d-pinitol, which is widely known to have potential anti-diabetic effects. In the present study, response surface methodology (RSM) was used to optimize d-pinitol extraction conditions with the Box-Behnken design. We then evaluated the anti-diabetic effects properties of IPE that was extracted under optimized conditions (53 °C, 119 min extraction time, and 1 : 11 dilution) in type 2 diabetic Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rats. IPE (400 mg kg-1 day-1) effectively controlled the increased fasting blood glucose level (decreased by 45% vs. GK-control rats) and impaired glucose tolerance (decreased area under curve (AUC) of glucose values by 24%, p < 0.05 vs. GK-control rats) after eight weeks of treatment. Furthermore, IPE significantly improved pancreatic islet morphology, β-cell survival, and insulin secretion in diabetic rats, thus contributing to the antihyperglycemic effect. Finally, prebiotic effects of IPE on gut microbiota were observed and included increased abundance of the beneficial bacteria Bacteroidales_S24-7 and Ruminococcaceae_UCG-014 and decreased abundance of Treponema_2 and Lactobacillus. Overall, IPE has a substantial effect on attenuating hyperglycemia and modulating gut microbiota composition in diabetic GK rats. Therefore, IPE might be a promising functional food for the prevention of diabetes.",Microdroplet self-propulsion during dropwise condensation on lubricant-infused surfaces.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089647,Soft matter,2019 05 15,"Water vapor condensation is common in nature and widely used in industrial applications, including water harvesting, power generation, and desalination. As compared to traditional filmwise condensation, dropwise condensation on lubricant-infused surfaces (LIS) can lead to an order-of-magnitude increase in heat transfer rates. Small droplets (D ≤ 100 μm) account for nearly 85% of the total heat transfer and droplet sweeping plays a crucial role in clearing nucleation sites, allowing for frequent re-nucleation. Here, we focus on the dynamic interplay of microdroplets with the thin lubricant film during water vapor condensation on LIS. Coupling high-speed imaging, optical microscopy, and interferometry, we show that the initially uniform lubricant film re-distributes during condensation. Governed by lubricant height gradients, microdroplets as small as 2 μm in diameter undergo rigorous and gravity-independent self-propulsion, travelling distances multiples of their diameters at velocities up to 1100 μm s-1. Although macroscopically the movement appears to be random, we show that on a microscopic level capillary attraction due to asymmetrical lubricant menisci causes this gravity-independent droplet motion. Based on a lateral force balance analysis, we quantitatively find that the sliding velocity initially increases during movement, but decreases sharply at shorter inter-droplet spacing. The maximum sliding velocity is inversely proportional to the oil viscosity and is strongly dependent of the droplet size, which is in excellent agreement with the experimental observations. This novel and non-traditional droplet movement is expected to significantly enhance the sweeping efficiency during dropwise condensation, leading to higher nucleation and heat transfer rates."

Accordingly, the molecular structure and electronic properties of 1b resemble those of 1a, but 1b readily reacts with carbon tetrachloride and methanol. The reaction of 1b with carbon tetrachloride providing a cyclic tetrachlorotetrasilane and an acyclic hexachlorotetrasilane suggests the generation of a 1,3-dichlorobicyclo[1.1.0]tetrasilane and its isomer, a tetrasiladiene, the latter of which was supported by the formation of an acyclic tetrasilane during the reaction of 1b with methanol.",Optimizing ligand structure for low-loading and fast catalysis for alkynyl-alcohol and -amine cyclization.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089624,"Dalton transactions (Cambridge, England : 2003)",2019 06 05,"A series of [Ru(Cp/Cp*)(PR2NR'2)(MeCN)]PF6 complexes were prepared, in which the steric and electronic properties of the primary coordination sphere were varied (R = Ph, t-Bu, Bn; and Cp vs. Cp*).

The effect of both the anion and the cation on the electronic environment of cationic nitrogen regions is explored. It concludes that the cationic N 1s binding energy shifts to the lower value when the basicity of the anion increases or the acidity of the cation decreases. The impact of the cation acidity on the cation-anion interactions is demonstrated systematically by carefully comparing the binding energies of anion-based components for each anion. It is found that for more basic anions, the charge-transfer effect between counterions can be effectively shielded; for less basic anions, such an effect is negligible. The charge shielding effect of the alkyl substituent is also studied by using dodecyl-based ionic liquids, compared to 1-alkyl-3-methylimidazolium analogues. It suggests that long alkyl substituents can have a significant electron donating effect to the cation headgroup and thus effectively shield the charge-transfer effect between cations and anions.",An exceptionally stable core-shell MOF/COF bifunctional catalyst for a highly efficient cascade deacetalization-Knoevenagel condensation reaction.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089619,"Chemical communications (Cambridge, England)",2019 05 31,A novel strategy has been developed to construct a highly stable core-shell MOF@COF (PCN-222-Co@TpPa-1) bifunctional catalyst through strong π-π stacking interaction.

Here we designed a platform for the facile and visualizable identification of inhibitors of MDM2 using co-expressed protein complexes of MDM2/p53. A hexahistidine-tag on MDM2 allows the binding of the protein complex to the Ni-NTA affinity resin, while the fluorescent protein fused to p53 enables the direct visualization of the interaction of p53 with MDM2. Hence, the inhibition of the MDM2/p53 interaction can be observed with the naked eye. The assay can be set up by directly loading cell lysate to the Ni-NTA affinity resin, and no chemical modification of proteins is needed. In addition to the qualitative analyses, the binding affinity of inhibitors to the MDM2 protein can be quantified by fluorescence titration. The applications of this system have been verified using small molecules and peptide inhibitors. As a proof of concept, we screened a small library using this platform. Interestingly, two types of novel inhibitors of MDM2, including cyclohexyl-triphenylamine derivatives and platinum complexes, were identified and their binding affinities were obtained. Quantitative measurements show that these new types of inhibitors demonstrate a high binding affinity (up to Kd = 51.9 nM) to MDM2.",Reduced fibrous capsule formation at nano-engineered silicone surfaces via tantalum ion implantation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089612,Biomaterials science,2019 05 15,"Although the design of more biocompatible polymeric implants has been studied for decades, their intended functionality continues to be impaired by the response of the host tissue to foreign bodies at the tissue-implant interface. In particular, the formation and contracture of fibrous capsules prevent the intimate integration of an implant with surrounding tissues, which leads to structural deformation of the implants and persistent discomfort and pain. We report a new surface nano-engineered silicone implant that reduces fibrous capsule formation and improves the biocompatibility of it via sputtering-based plasma immersion ion implantation (S-PIII). This technique can introduce biologically compatible tantalum (Ta) on the silicone surface to produce a Ta-implanted skin layer (<60 nm thick) as well as generate either smooth (Smooth/Ta silicone) or nano-textured (Nano/Ta silicone) surface morphologies. The biologically inert chemical structure and strong hydrophobic surface characteristics of bare silicone are substantially ameliorated after Ta ion implantation. In particular, the Nano/Ta silicone implant's combination of surface nano-texturing as a physical cue and the Ta-implanted layer as a chemical cue was found to be very effective at achieving outstanding hydrophilicity and fibroblast affinity compared to the bare and Smooth/Ta silicone implants. In a mouse in vivo study conducted for 8 weeks, the Nano/Ta silicone implant inhibited fibrous capsule formation and contracture on its surface better than the bare silicone based on an analysis of the number of macrophages, myofibroblast differentiation and activation, collagen density, and thickness of fibrous capsules."

Here, we investigated the alleviation of fat accumulation and mechanism of action of the saponin-enriched ethanol extract from Momordica charantia (MSE) in Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans). First, MSE had a strong fat-reduction capacity in normal and high-fat worms. Second, MSE significantly increased the proportion of small lipid droplets and reduced the average particle size in ZXW618. Meanwhile, it improved lifespan and healthspan and physiological functions, such as age pigmentation and neuroprotection. Furthermore, MSE mediated fat reduction gets involved neither in energy intake nor in energy expenditure. Finally, MSE might down-regulate sbp-1 and nhr-49 via mdt-15, and up regulate age-1 via daf-2. And these targets genes together down-regulated the expression of fat-5, fat-6 and fat-7 to decrease fat accumulation.

Although the detection of molecular behavior that characterizes systems is an important task in the study of MD, it is typically difficult and depends on human expert knowledge. Therefore, we propose a novel analysis scheme for MD data using deep neural networks. A key aspect of our scheme is the estimation of statistical distances between different ensembles that are probability distributions over the possible states of systems. This allows us to build low-dimensional embeddings of ensembles to visualize differences between systems in a compact metric space. Furthermore, the molecular behavior that contributes to the differences between systems can also be detected using the trained function of deep neural networks. The applicability of our scheme is demonstrated using three types of MD data. Our scheme could be a powerful tool to clarify the underlying physics in the molecular systems.","Oxo-bridged trinuclear and tetranuclear manganese complexes supported with nitrogen donor ligands: syntheses, structures and properties.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089599,"Dalton transactions (Cambridge, England : 2003)",2019 06 05,"In this work, we present the syntheses of two μ3-oxo bridged mixed-valent trinuclear MnIIMnIII complexes (1 and 2) and a μ4-oxo bridged tetranuclear Mn complex (3).

The high affinity of ss-DNA to AuNPs compared with ds-DNA is easily demonstrated by the results of competitive binding with SYBR Green I (SG). Additionally, it is proven that at 25.0 °C, AuNPs/ds-DNA and AuNPs/ss-DNA complexes undergo a transition from extended-coil to more compact structures when the AuNPs concentration (CAuNPs) is increased, which for the ds-DNA system is accompanied by partial denaturation. Particularly, for the AuNPs/ss-DNA system all of these techniques confirm that at a high CAuNPs, the compaction process is followed by a discrete transition to aggregation and an increase in structure size. A thorough analysis of the conformational changes described indicates that these processes are larger in low salt concentration and at high temperature. However, the most striking feature of this work is the abnormal melting temperature profiles (Tm) registered at high R = CAuNPs/CDNA ratios, which are remarkable and of interest for chemical sensing. At a suitable R ratio, which varies depending on CNaCl, a complex melting profile for the AuNPs/ds-DNA system was registered with two characteristic transitions: Tm,1 = 65.0 °C and Tm,2 = 95.0 °C. The highly sensitive atomic force microscopy technique performed at 25.0 °C and 65.0 °C also showed a different behaviour in both ss- and AuNPs/ds-DNA systems, which explains the characteristic melting curves. Specifically for the AuNPs/ss-DNA system, AFM at 25.0 °C revealed the formation of large-sized aggregates formed by AuNPs/ss-DNA compact structures linked by AuNPs. However, when both AuNPs/ds-DNA and AuNPs/ss-DNA complexes were incubated at 65.0 °C, the formation of highly stable ordered structures was always visualized at high R. Therefore, this shows that some key parameters for effective control of the formation of DNA/RNA-linked particles are: the selection of an optimal temperature below the ds-DNA melting point, an appropriate CAuNPs, and the addition of low CNaCl. The optimization of these parameters for each AuNPs/DNA system could improve biological sensing and DNA/RNA delivery.",Photodeposition of a conformal metal oxide nanocoating.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089594,"Chemical communications (Cambridge, England)",2019 05 29,"A versatile photochemical route is reported to access conformal metal oxide nanocoatings including Cr2O3, Al2O3, ZnO and In2O3 on semiconductor substrates.

Herein, we take Calix[4]quinone (C4Q) molecule as an example to develop a viable mechanism investigation method for such materials. The lithiation profile of C4Q is determined by condensed Fukui function which provides the reaction sites and orders. A correction of redox potential is proposed by leaving out the ion-transfer effect during the redox reaction based on Gibbs free energy change. The redox potential obtained by this approach shows high consistency with the experimental results. Moreover, this method can also be well extended to study the lithiation mechanism of another BQ-based macrocyclic compound (Pillar[5]quinone).

Early studies have suggested that despite increased fracture risk, obese children have a higher bone mass. However, body size corrections applied to account for wide variations in size between children led to the finding that obese children have a lower total body and regional bone mass relative to their body size. Advances in skeletal imaging have shifted the focus from quantity of bone in obese children to evaluating the changes in bone microarchitecture that result in a change in bone quality and strength. The findings suggest that bone strength in the appendicular skeleton does not appropriately adapt to an increase in body size which results in a mismatch between bone strength and force from falls. Recent evidence points to differing influences of fat compartments on skeletal development-visceral fat may have a negative impact on bone which may be related to the associated adverse metabolic environment, while marrow adipose tissue may have an independent effect on trabecular bone development in obese children. The role of brown fat has received recent attention, demonstrating differences in the influence on bone mass between white and brown adipose tissues.

Generally, low calorie dietary intake combined with regular exercise is the most common modality to lose bodily fat in obese people. Although this is the first modality of choice for obesity treatment, it needs to be applied to obese patients for at least 12 weeks or more and it does not provide consistent results because it is difficult to suppress increased appetite due to exercise. Recently, many researchers have been applying hypoxic conditions for the treatment of obesity, as many studies show that people residing in high altitudes have a lower percentage of body fat and fewer obesity-related illnesses than people living at sea level. Hypoxic therapy treatment, including hypoxic exposure or hypoxic exercise training, is recommended as a way to treat and prevent obesity by suppression of appetite, increasing basal metabolic rate and fat oxidation, and minimizing side effects. Hypoxic therapy inhibits energy intake and appetite-related hormones, and enhances various cardiovascular and metabolic function parameters. These observations indicate that hypoxic therapy is a new treatment modality for inducing fat reduction and promoting metabolic and cardiovascular health, which may be an important and necessary strategy for the treatment of obesity. As such, hypoxic therapy is now used as a general medical practice for obesity treatment in many developed countries. Therefore, hypoxic therapy could be a new, practical, and useful therapeutic modality for obesity and obesity-related comorbidities.",Elderly Obesity: Is It Harmful or Beneficial?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089547,Journal of obesity & metabolic syndrome,2019 06 10,"The prevalence of obesity among elderly populations is a matter of increasing concern. Elderly obesity is a pathophysiologically complex issue, and predictions regarding obesity-related comorbidity and weight management are challenging. As individuals age, changes in the body composition, such as increase in fat mass and decrease in muscle mass, are observed even in the absence of changes in body weight and body mass index. Hence, body mass index and other indices of obesity should be cautiously interpreted in the elderly, and weight loss should be recommended for obese elderly individuals with functional limitations or metabolic complications that may improve with weight loss. By the year 2026, more than 20% of the Korean population will be aged 65 years or older, and this along with the obesity epidemic is expected to pose an increasingly serious financial problem for the Korean healthcare system. This review summarizes the epidemiology of obesity in Korea, the clinical implications of elderly obesity, and considerations regarding weight management. Understanding the complexity of elderly obesity could facilitate the design of preventative and therapeutic strategies that would have a positive impact on the overall health of the Korean population.",The Effect of Circadian and Sleep Disruptions on Obesity Risk.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089546,Journal of obesity & metabolic syndrome,2019 05 17,"The prevalence of obesity continues to increase worldwide. Multiple risk factors and complex mechanisms are involved in the development and maintenance of obesity. Recently, emerging evidence has indicated that the circadian rhythm is important for regulating metabolism because the circadian system modulates energy metabolism and enhances certain energetic activities during day and night. Lifestyle also has a great impact on the circadian system. In addition to traditional risk factors, sleep and circadian disruptions are known modifiable risk factors for obesity and other metabolic disorders. This paper reviews recent evidence of relationships between energy metabolism and the circadian system and discusses how sleep disruption and circadian misalignment influence the development of obesity.",ADHD symptoms are associated with the modular structure of intrinsic brain networks in a representative sample of healthy adults.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089485,"Network neuroscience (Cambridge, Mass.)",2019 05 17,"Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common neurodevelopmental disorders with significant and often lifelong effects on social, emotional, and cognitive functioning. Influential neurocognitive models of ADHD link behavioral symptoms to altered connections between and within functional brain networks. Here, we investigate whether network-based theories of ADHD can be generalized to understanding variations in ADHD-related behaviors within the normal (i.e., clinically unaffected) adult population. In a large and representative sample, self-rated presence of ADHD symptoms varied widely; only 8 out of 291 participants scored in the clinical range. Subject-specific brain network graphs were modeled from functional MRI resting-state data and revealed significant associations between (nonclinical) ADHD symptoms and region-specific profiles of between-module and within-module connectivity. Effects were located in brain regions associated with multiple neuronal systems including the default-mode network, the salience network, and the central executive system. Our results are consistent with network perspectives of ADHD and provide further evidence for the relevance of an appropriate information transfer between task-negative (default-mode) and task-positive brain regions. More generally, our findings support a dimensional conceptualization of ADHD and contribute to a growing understanding of cognition as an emerging property of functional brain networks.",Optimal modularity and memory capacity of neural reservoirs.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089484,"Network neuroscience (Cambridge, Mass.)",2019 05 17,"The neural network is a powerful computing framework that has been exploited by biological evolution and by humans for solving diverse problems. Although the computational capabilities of neural networks are determined by their structure, the current understanding of the relationships between a neural network's architecture and function is still primitive. Here we reveal that a neural network's modular architecture plays a vital role in determining the neural dynamics and memory performance of the network of threshold neurons. In particular, we demonstrate that there exists an optimal modularity for memory performance, where a balance between local cohesion and global connectivity is established, allowing optimally modular networks to remember longer. Our results suggest that insights from dynamical analysis of neural networks and information-spreading processes can be leveraged to better design neural networks and may shed light on the brain's modular organization.",Pilot study of a ketogenic diet in relapsing-remitting MS.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089482,Neurology(R) neuroimmunology & neuroinflammation,2019 05 17,"To assess the safety and tolerability of a modified Atkins diet (KDMAD), a type of ketogenic diet (KD), in subjects with relapsing MS while exploring potential benefits of KDs in MS.",Manipulation of Type I Interferon Signaling by HIV and AIDS-Associated Viruses.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089479,Journal of immunology research,2019 05 18,"Type I Interferons were first described for their profound antiviral abilities in cell culture and animal models, and later, they were translated into potent antiviral therapeutics. However, as additional studies into the function of Type I Interferons progressed, it was also seen that pathogenic viruses have coevolved to encode potent mechanisms allowing them to evade or suppress the impact of Type I Interferons on their replication. For chronic viral infections, such as HIV and many of the AIDS-associated viruses, including HTLV, HCV, KSHV, and EBV, the clinical efficacy of Type I Interferons is limited by these mechanisms. Here, we review some of the ways that HIV and AIDS-associated viruses thrive in Type I Interferon-rich environments via mechanisms that block the function of this important antiviral cytokine. Overall, a better understanding of these mechanisms creates avenues to better understand the innate immune response to these viruses as well as plan the development of antivirals that would allow the natural antiviral effect of Type I Interferons to manifest during these infections.","Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV): Infection, Immunological Response, and Vaccine Development.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089478,Journal of immunology research,2019 05 17,"Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) first emerged in late 2012. Since its emergence, a total of 2279 patients from 27 countries have been infected across the globe according to a World Health Organization (WHO) report (Feb. 12th, 2019). Approximately 806 patients have died. The virus uses its spike proteins as adhesive factors that are proinflammatory for host entry through a specific receptor called dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4). This receptor is considered a key factor in the signaling and activation of the acquired and innate immune responses in infected patients. Using potent antigens in combination with strong adjuvants may effectively trigger the activation of specific MERS-CoV cellular responses as well as the production of neutralizing antibodies. Unfortunately, to date, there is no effective approved treatment or vaccine for MERS-CoV. Thus, there are urgent needs for the development of novel MERS-CoV therapies as well as vaccines to help minimize the spread of the virus from infected patients, thereby mitigating the risk of any potential pandemics. Our main goals are to highlight and describe the current knowledge of both the innate and adaptive immune responses to MERS-CoV and the current state of MERS-CoV vaccine development. We believe this study will increase our understanding of the mechanisms that enhance the MERS-CoV immune response and subsequently contribute to the control of MERS-CoV infections.",Increased Serum Soluble Urokinase-Type Plasminogen Activator Receptor (suPAR) Levels in FSGS: A Meta-Analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089477,Journal of immunology research,2019 05 17,"The soluble urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR) has been found to be elevated in primary focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (pFSGS).

The data were analyzed using meta-analysis methods and the random effects model. The heterogeneity of studies was analyzed using the I2 index. The data were analyzed using R and STATA software (ver. 11.2). Twenty seven articles conducted from 2002 to 2016 were collected to be included in the meta-analysis process. The total sample size was 161,941 patients in an age range of 0-6 years. The final estimate of the prevalence of different forms of malnutrition through meta-analysis of data extracted from studies in Iran was as follows: severe underweight (1%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1-1), moderate underweight (6%; 95% CI, 5-7), mild underweight (25%; 95% CI, 21-28), severe short stature (3%; 95% CI, 2-3), moderate short stature (8%; 95% CI, 6-9), mild short stature (21%; 95% CI, 17-24), severe slimness (1%; 95% CI, 1-1), moderate slimness (5%; 95% CI, 4-5) and mild slimness (20%; 95% CI, 17-24).

Twenty-one pairs of caregivers and their children with PDD were surveyed. The caregivers completed surveys regarding their children's weight status, food habits, and dietary quality and their food habits, nutritional perceptions, knowledge, and feeding practices. Dietary quality was assessed as mean adequacy ratio, dietary diversity score (DDS), dietary variety score (DVS), and Index of Nutritional Quality (INQ). The children were in the normal ranges of body mass index (BMI) and Röhrer index. Having three times a meal, regular meal time, salty taste of the caregiver were related to those of the children with PDD (β = 0.533, 0.447, and 0.886, respectively; p < 0.05). Child control, food as reward, involvement, pressure, and restriction for the health of the caregiver were positively related to DDS, DVS, and INQ of the children with PDD (p < 0.05). High feeding stress and nutritional knowledge of the caregiver were related to the high BMI of the children with PDD (β = 0.445 and 0.602, respectively; p < 0.05), whereas emotion regulation, encourage balance and variety, and involvement of caregiver were negatively related to BMI (β = -0.426, -0.430, and -0.388, respectively; p < 0.05).

Food literacy, the functional, interactive, and critical ability to manage dietary information with the aim of improving health, is of global interest. In South Korea (hereafter Korea), there is currently a lack of food literacy research, despite its pertinence for the development of public health policies that are tailored to recipients' ability to understand and address health and nutrition issues. In this study, the research trend and policy implications of food literacy are derived through reviewing preceding studies related to food literacy in Korea and elsewhere. Existing literature on food literacy in Korea placed much emphasis on the functional ability of food literacy. Future research on the operational definitions of interactive and critical food literacy and their health effects in Korea is necessary. In addition, there is a lack of research on the development and validation of measurement tools that evaluate integrative concepts of food literacy. To accurately examine the relationships among food literacy, diet, and health, standardized measurement tools that can comprehensively evaluate food literacy frameworks for various Korean sub-population groups should be developed.

Exercise has been suggested as an efficient strategy to improve sleep; however, the effects of different types of exercise on sleep in individuals with overweight and obesity are not well understood. We examined effects of active commuting and leisure-time exercise on sleep in individuals with overweight or obesity. 130 physically inactive adults (20-45 years) with overweight or class 1 obesity (body mass index: 25-35 kg/m2) were randomized to 6 months of habitual lifestyle (CON, n = 18), active commuting by bike (BIKE, n = 35), or leisure-time exercise of moderate intensity (MOD, 50% VO2peak-reserve, n = 39) or vigorous intensity (VIG, 70% VO2peak-reserve, n = 38), 5 days/week. Sleep was assessed from 7-day/night accelerometry and questionnaires at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months. 92 participants were included in a per protocol analysis. At 3 months, sleep duration was longer in VIG (29 min/night [3; 55] (mean [95% CI]), p=0.03) but not in BIKE and MOD (p ≥ 0.11) compared with CON and was not different between groups at 6 months (p ≥ 0.36 vs. CON).

The effects were, however, primarily attributable to shorter and more irregular sleep in CON over time. Our findings suggest that effects of exercise on sleep in individuals with overweight and obesity may be restricted to leisure-time exercise with a short-term effect on sleep duration after vigorous intensity exercise (3 months) but a more regular sleep pattern after 6 months of moderate and vigorous intensity exercise compared with physically inactive controls.

NF-κB and TNF-α have been implicated in the activation of the aging process, but the signaling molecules responsible for the inactivation of NF-κB and TNF-α remain unknown. Exosomes have been reported to improve heart functions by releasing miRNA. Recent studies suggest that lncRNAs are more tissue-specific and developmental stage-specific compared to miRNA. However, the role of lncRNA in exosome-mediated cardiac repair has not been explored. In the present study, we focused on metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT1), which is an lncRNA associated with cell senescence. We discovered that human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell- (UMSC-) derived exosomes prevent aging-induced cardiac dysfunction. Silencer RNA against lncRNA MALAT1 blocked the beneficial effects of exosomes.

Inflammation-associated prooxidant processes may be controlled by antioxidants; however, interference with redox-regulated mechanisms is a complex endeavor. An essential feature of the cellular immune response is the acceleration of tryptophan (Trp) breakdown, leading to the formation of several bioactive catabolites. Long-term activation of this immunobiochemical pathway contributes to the establishment of a tolerogenic environment, thereby supporting allograft survival. Herein, the impact of the antioxidant sodium sulfite on the development of graft vasculopathy was assessed in murine aortic transplantation. Allogeneic (BALB/c to C57BL/6) heterotopic murine aortic transplantations were performed. Animals were left untreated or were treated with 10 μl of 0.1 M, of 0.01 M sodium sulfite, or of 0.1 M sodium sulfate, intraperitoneally once/day, until postoperative day (POD) 100. Grafts were assessed by histology, immunohistochemistry, and adhesion molecule gene expression. Serum concentrations of tryptophan and its catabolite kynurenine (Kyn) were measured. On day 100, graft vasculopathy was significantly increased upon treatment with 0.1 M sodium sulfite, compared to allogeneic untreated controls (p = 0.004), which correlated with a significant increase of α-smooth-muscle-actin, Vcam-1, and P-selectin. Serum Kyn concentrations increased in the allogeneic control group over time (p < 0.05, POD ≥ 50), while low-dose sodium sulfite treatment (0.01 M) treatment resulted in a decrease in Kyn levels over time (p < 0.05, POD ≥ 10), compared to the respective baselines (p < 0.05). Longitudinal analysis of serum metabolite concentrations in the different treatment groups further identified an overall effect of sodium sulfite on Kyn concentrations. Antioxidative treatment may result in ambivalent consequences. Our data reveal that an excess of antioxidants like sodium sulfite can aggravate allograft vasculopathy, which further highlights the challenges associated with interventions that interfere with the complex interplay of redox-regulated inflammatory processes.",Evidence of Blood and Muscle Redox Status Imbalance in Experimentally Induced Renal Insufficiency in a Rabbit Model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089418,Oxidative medicine and cellular longevity,2019 05 17,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is accompanied by a disturbed redox homeostasis, especially in end-stage patients, which is associated with pathological complications such as anemia, atherosclerosis, and muscle atrophy. However, limited evidence exists about redox disturbances before the end stage of CKD. Moreover, the available redox literature has not yet provided clear associations between circulating and tissue-specific (muscle) oxidative stress levels. The aim of the study was to evaluate commonly used redox status indices in the blood and in two different types of skeletal muscle (psoas, soleus) in the predialysis stages of CKD, using an animal model of renal insufficiency, and to investigate whether blood redox status indices could be reflecting the skeletal muscle redox status. Indices evaluated included reduced glutathione (GSH), oxidized glutathione (GSSG), glutathione reductase (GR), catalase (CAT), total antioxidant capacity (TAC), protein carbonyls (PC), and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS). Results showed that blood GSH was higher in the uremic group compared to the control (17.50 ± 1.73 vs. 12.43 ± 1.01, p = 0.033). In both muscle types, PC levels were higher in the uremic group compared to the control (psoas: 1.086 ± 0.294 vs. 0.596 ± 0.372, soleus: 2.52 ± 0.29 vs. 0.929 ± 0.41, p < 0.05). The soleus had higher levels of TBARS, PC, GSH, CAT, and GR and lower TAC compared to the psoas in both groups. No significant correlations in redox status indices between the blood and skeletal muscles were found. However, in the uremic group, significant correlations between the psoas and soleus muscles in PC, GSSG, and CAT levels emerged, not present in the control. Even in the early stages of CKD, a disturbance in redox homeostasis was observed, which seemed to be muscle type-specific, while blood levels of redox indices did not seem to reflect the intramuscular condition. The above results highlight the need for further research in order to identify the key mechanisms driving the onset and progression of oxidative stress and its detrimental effects on CKD patients.",Exercise in Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase Deficiency: Harmful or Harmless?

Coexpression of cluster of differentiation 36 (CD36) with fatty acid transport protein 4 (FATP4) or long-chain acyl CoA synthetase 1 (ACSL1) synergistically activated fatty acid uptake in experimental models. In this study, we investigated the immunohistochemical expression of CD36, FATP4, and ACSL1 in 180 cases of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in comparison with 80 specimens of the normal kidney. We also examined the clinical implication of these three fatty acid transporters in RCC, which was validated by an open-access The Cancer Genome Atlas data analysis. Both CD36 and FATP4 revealed higher membranous expressions in RCC tumor cells than in normal cells. In contrast, ACSL1 expression was remarkably reduced in RCC tumor cells compared to normal cells. CD36, FATP4, and ACSL1 showed high expressions in 74 (41.1%), 85 (47.2%), and 72 (40.0%) out of 180 RCC cases, respectively. Clinically, high FATP4 in tumor cells was associated with female gender (p = 0.05), high TNM stage (p = 0.039), tumor necrosis (p = 0.009), and tumor recurrence (p = 0.037), while high ACSL1 was only related to female gender (p = 0.023). CD36 expression revealed no correlation with the clinicopathologic parameters of RCC. Increased FATP4 expression displayed an association with short recurrence-free survival (p = 0.003). In conclusion, the high FATP4 expression was clinically associated with poor prognostic factors of RCC. Overexpression of membranous FATP4 and CD36 combined with reduced cytoplasmic expression of ACSL1 might be a tumor-specific feature of RCC, contributing to the tumorigenesis and tumor progression.",The Expression Patterns and Associated Clinical Parameters of Human Endogenous Retrovirus-H Long Terminal Repeat-Associating Protein 2 and Transmembrane and Immunoglobulin Domain Containing 2 in Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089395,Disease markers,2019 05 17,"Human endogenous retrovirus-H long terminal repeat-associating protein 2 (HHLA2) and transmembrane and immunoglobulin domain containing 2 (TMIGD2) are new immune checkpoint molecules of the B7:CD28 family; however, little research has been performed on these immune checkpoint molecules. In this study, we used oral squamous cells carcinoma (OSCC) tissue microarrays and immunohistochemistry methods to investigate the expression patterns of HHLA2 and TMIGD2 in OSCC. After comparing the HHLA2 and TMIGD2 expression levels in OSCC, dysplasia, and mucosa, we found increased HHLA2 expression in OSCC and dysplasia, while the TMIGD2 expression was decreased in OSCC and dysplasia. Using the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test, we found that higher HHLA2 or TMIGD2 expression levels in OSCC indicate poor prognosis. Furthermore, two-tailed Pearson's statistical analysis revealed that the HHLA2 expression levels in OSCC, dysplasia, and mucosa were positively correlated with the T cell immunoglobulin and mucin-domain containing-3 (TIM3), lymphocyte-activation gene 3 (LAG3), B7 homolog 3 protein (B7-H3), B7 homolog 4 protein (B7H4), and V-domain Ig suppressor of T cell activation (VISTA) levels, while the TMIGD2 expression levels in OSCC, dysplasia, and mucosa were inversely correlated with the TIM3, LAG3, and B7H3 levels.

Colorectal adenomatous polyps are at high risk for the development of CRC. In this report, we described the metabolic changes in the sera from patients with colorectal polyps and CRC by using the NMR-based metabolomics. 110 serum samples were collected from patients and healthy controls, including 40 CRC patients, 32 colorectal polyp patients, and 38 healthy controls. The metabolic profiles and differential metabolites of sera were analyzed by multivariate statistical analysis (MSA), including principal component analysis (PCA), partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), and orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) methods. A total of 23 differential metabolites were identified from MSA. According to the pathway analysis and multivariate ROC curve-based exploratory analysis by using the relative concentrations of differential metabolites, we found abnormal metabolic pathways and potential biomarkers involved with the colorectal polyp and CRC. The results showed that the pyruvate metabolism and glycerolipid metabolism were activated in colorectal polyps. And the glycolysis and glycine, serine, and threonine metabolism were activated in CRC. The changed metabolism may promote cellular proliferation. In addition, we found that the rates of acetate/glycerol and lactate/citrate could be the potential biomarkers in colorectal polyp and CRC, respectively.

Anticoagulants are extensively used in treatment of these disorders. Vitamin K antagonists, like Warfarin, are frequently used in medication. Vascular calcification (VC) is a significant side-effect of vitamin K antagonists especially Warfarin. There is an urgent need to find natural, efficient, non-toxic, and cost effective anticoagulants without dangerous side-effect like VC. In the present study, we evaluated the potential of thirteen fermentation broth extracts of actinobacteria (FBEA) (200 µg mL-1) to prolong whole blood prothrombin time (PT)/international normalized ratio (INR) and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT). The fractions of the most effective FBEA were further investigated for their inhibitory effect on VC. The results showed PT/INR of the healthy blood samples was sensitive to the presence of five FBEA. Their INR index fell in the 1.2 to 8.6 range and six FBEA prolonged both PT/INR and APTT parameters (1.7-5 INR, and 46-59 s for APTT). The fractions of Kribbella sp. UTMC 267 FBE (200 µg mL-1), as the most efficient FBE, only inhibited intrinsic and common pathways of coagulation (APTT). Under calcification condition, Kribbella sp. UTMC 267 fractions (20 µg mL-1) showed significant inhibitory effect on VC in alizarin red staining (13.3-76 %) and alkaline phosphatase activity of VSMCs (33-62%).

The aim of the present study was formulation and optimization of a new cationic lipid-modified PLGA nanoparticles (NPs) as a delivery system for Mycobacterium tuberculosis HspX/EsxS fusion protein. The cationic lipid-modified PLGA NPs containing HspX/EsxS fusion protein were prepared using a modiﬁed double emulsion solvent evaporation method. Scanning electron microscopy and dynamic light scattering (DLS) tools were used to determine physical properties of hybrid NPs. A multi-level full factorial design was used to evaluate the influence of two factors of PLGA:DDA weight ratio (w/w) and PVA concentration (%) on size, surface charge, polydispersity index, encapsulation efficiency and yield. Finally, the optimal formulation was achieved based on desired responses. Mathematical models were obtained to indicate the relation between the studied factors and responses. The DDA concentration showed an increasing effect on surface charge and also a decreasing effect on particle size, encapsulation efficiency and yield. Higher amounts of DDA increased surface charge of NPs; however, the size, encapsulation efficiency and yield were decreased. The influence of various concentrations of PVA on different physical characteristics of PLGA:DDA hybrid NPs was variable. The optimal formulation consisted of 0.91 (55:5, w/w) weight ratio of PLGA:DDA and 0.5% PVA. The hybrid NPs showed acceptable particle size distribution, strong positive surface charge, prolonged antigen release and good encapsulation efficiency in comparison to PLGA alone.

In this research, biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) was successfully accomplished in the presence of Prosopis farcta fruit extract as a reducing agent. Proceeding of the reaction was assessed by using UV-vis spectroscopy. Characterization of silver nanoparticles was carried out by X-ray Diffraction spectroscopy (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The influence of process variables such as temperature, reaction time, and extract concentration was also investigated to optimize the biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles. The average size of synthesized AgNPs was 12.68 nm (10.26-14.65 nm). Furthermore, fruit extract and AgNPs were evaluated for total phenolic and flavonoid contents and were subjected to determine their antiradical scavenging activity using 1,1-diphenyl-2-picryl-hydrazyl (DPPH) and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assay and antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumonia, Escherichia, Salmonella typhi using the disk diffusion method. The total phenols and flavonoids in AgNPs-containing plant extract were 462.69 (mg GAE/g extract) and 386.94 (mg QE/g extract) respectively, which were significantly higher than fruit extract. Biosynthesized AgNPs showed a higher antioxidant and antibacterial activity compared to P. farcta fruit extract alone.

Diabetes was induced by 5 weeks feeding of Wistar rats with high fat diet (HFD) and subsequent i.p injection of STZ (35 mg/kg). Diabetic animals (serum glucose above 250 mg/dL) were treated with Okra powder (200mg/kg) supplemented in diet or metformin (200mg/kg) for 30days. After 30 days of treatment, animals were euthanized and insulin resistance markers (insulin and glucose levels and HOMA-IR), ovarian expression of apoptotic/antiapoptotic genes (Bax, caspase3 and Bcl2) and serum oxidant/antioxidant levels (SOD, GPX and CAT activities and MDA level) were determined. The ovaries were also processed for histological study. Hyperglycemia and reduced body weight of diabetic rats were improved after administration of Okra for 30days. This effect was relatively similar to metformin. Okra resulted in reduction of follicular atresia in concomitant with down regulation of apoptotic related genes (Bax and caspase3) in ovary of diabetic rats. Okra could also diminished oxidative stress in diabetic rats by increasing of serum GPX and CAT activities and reducing the lipid peroxidation level. The results of the present study revealed that Okra powder could be useful intervention for improvement of ovaian dysfunction in diabetic rat by three probable mechanisms; attenuation of glucotoxicity, down regulation of ovarian apoptosis related genes and reduction of oxidative stress."

The functional domains of FHIT involved in tumor inhibition was interpreted. In-silico screening data were employed to construct truncated forms of FHIT to assess their cytotoxic effects on the HT1080 cell line. Full FHIT expression was confirmed by western blotting and expression of two FHIT truncates were confirmed by RT-PCR. Transfection of these truncated forms into HT1080 cells showed that the N-terminal truncated form (amino acids 17-102) better inhibited proliferation than the full-length FHIT. The combined effects of these truncated forms augmented doxorubicin-induced cytotoxicity. Functional analysis demonstrated that these fragments and their combination with doxorubicin can arrest cells in the G2 phase of the cell cycle as specified by flow cytometry. The FHIT functional domains can be used as lead compounds for development of drug designs and gene transfer for cancer therapy.,Supernatant Metabolites from Halophilic Archaea to Reduce Tumorigenesis in Prostate Cancer In-vitro and In-vivo.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089359,Iranian journal of pharmaceutical research : IJPR,2019 05 17,"Halophilic archaea are known as the novel producers of natural products and their supernatant metabolites could have cytotoxic effects on cancer cells.

In conclusion, we suggested here for the first time that supernatant metabolites from Halobacterium salinarum IBRC M10715 could be a novel component against prostate cancer in-vitro and in-vivo with remarkable reduction in stem-like properties of tumor.",Cytotoxic and Anticancer Effects of ICD-85 (Venom Derived Peptides) in Human Breast Adenocarcinoma and Normal Human Dermal Fibroblasts.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089358,Iranian journal of pharmaceutical research : IJPR,2019 05 17,"ICD-85 (venom derived peptides) has anti-proliferative effect and anti- angiogenesis activity on cancer cells. This study was performed to test the effect of ICD-85, on Human breast adenocarcinoma (MCF-7) and normal Human Dermal Fibroblasts (HDF) cell lines. In this experimental study, Mitochondrial activity, Neutral red uptake, Lactate dehydrogenase (cell necrosis), and cell morphology were assessed under unexposed and ICD-85 exposed conditions. Caspase-9 colorimetric assay kit was used to determine caspase protease activity. Morphological changes in MCF-7 cells on treatment with ICD-85 compared with untreated MCF-7 cells are consistent with characterizing the features of apoptosis such as granulation and cell rounding which finally results in the generation of apoptotic bodies. In contrast, this difference was not observed in normal cells. In MTT assay, ICD-85 induced dose dependent manner cytotoxic effects on MCF-7 cells which were confirmed by neutral red assay. The results showed that inhibitory concentration 50% (IC50) value of ICD-85 for MCF-7 cells at 24 h was 36.45 ± 0.38 μg/mL. However, when HDF cells were exposed to ICD-85, no significant elevation of LDH release were observed at concentrations below 20 μg/mL. The apoptosis-induction of ICD-85 on MCF-7 cell was found to be through activation of caspase-9 which was 13 fold greater than unexposed cell. This study showed that ICD-85 induced apoptosis in MCF-7 cell line through caspase activation and hence it can be considered for further investigation to use ICD-85 as a potential therapy for breast cancer.",Sensitization of Resistance Ovarian Cancer Cells to Cisplatin by Biogenic Synthesized Silver Nanoparticles through p53 Activation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089357,Iranian journal of pharmaceutical research : IJPR,2019 05 17,"Today, drug resistance is one of the major problems in fight against cancer. Therefore, combination of therapeutic strategies was raised to effectively improve disease prognosis. In this regard, silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are considered significant due to their anticancer properties. This study aimed to return sensitivity to cisplatin to A2780 cisplatin-resistance cell lines in the presence of biogenic synthesis curcumin-coated silver nanoparticles (cAgNPs). Synergic cellular effects of cAgNPs and cisplatin on ovarian carcinoma 2780 resistant to cisplatin cells were assessed using MTT assay, Acridine orange (AO)/propidium iodide (PI), DAPI staining, Annexin V/PI assay, and caspase 3/9 activation assay. Finally, expression of p53 and MMP-9 genes were evaluated using semi-quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). According to the results, 8 µg/mL and 62 µg/mL of cAgNPs and cisplatin led to 50% cell death in 48 h, respectively. Therefore, we combined non-toxic concentration of nanoparticles (1-5 µg/mL) with cisplatin (2.5 µg/mL). Decreased proliferation rate was about 50% for synergic use of cisplatin (2.5 µg/mL) and cAgNPs (2 µg/mL). According to the results, cell death induction significantly increased by AO/PI, DAPI staining and Annexin V/PI assay in the combined group. Moreover, activity of caspase 3/9 significantly increased in the mentioned group. The combined use of cAgNPs and cisplatin resulted in upregulated expression of p53 gene and downregulated expression of MPP-9 gene. As observed in this study, a combination of cAgNPs and cisplatin increased the efficiency of apoptosis induction in A2780 cells, compared to the independent use of cisplatin or cAgNPs.",Does Biosynthetic Silver Nanoparticles Are More Stable With Lower Toxicity than Their Synthetic Counterparts?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089356,Iranian journal of pharmaceutical research : IJPR,2019 05 17,"Control of size and shape is a challenge in nanoparticle synthesis. Synthetic and biosynthetic (both extracellular and intracellular) methods are used to prepare silver nanoparticle (SNP).

S. aureus strains biosynthesized SNPs intracellularly, while in the method of the extracellular biosynthesis, none of the strains could produce the SNP under different conditions (dark, bright light, and the presence of nitrate ion). Intracellular SNPs were purified. The results of this study and previous results were used to compare different properties of the biosynthetic (intra- and extracellular) and synthetic SNPs in terms of shape, size, zeta potential, stability, and toxicity. The results confirmed lower toxicity of biosynthetic SNPs in-vitro assays, and their more stability with less aggregation compared to the synthetic ones.

Unfortunately, due to its high volatility effect, its repellency effect was compromised. The incorporation of essential oil in a microencapsulation formulation has been shown to help improve the stability and potency of the repellent. In this study, Citrus grandis peel oil (CGPO) was encapsulated by using the interfacial precipitation chemistry technique. The microencapsulated CGPO was then formulated into lotion form to produce topical repellent formulation. This study includes the characterization of microcapsules with regards to the morphology, size distribution, zeta potential, Fourier Transmission Infrared spectrophotometer (FTIR), and Thermogravity analysis (TGA). The effectiveness of the microencapsulated CGPO-lotion formulation against mosquitoes was evaluated in the laboratory setting. Results indicated that CGPO have been successfully encapsulated with 6.5 µm in diameter and zeta potential values, -47.9 mV. The FTIR analysis spectrum indicated the presence of interaction between the wall materials in microcapsules. The TGA analysis demonstrated that microencapsulation improved the thermal stability of CGPO. Repellency assay revealed that microencapsulated CGPO- based formulation possessed excellent effect compared with pure CGPO. In conclusion, CGPO was successfully encapsulated and the microencapsulation aid to improve the repellency effect of CGPO against mosquito bites.",SPION Conjugated Curcumin Nano-Imaging Probe: Synthesis and Bio-Physical Evaluation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089354,Iranian journal of pharmaceutical research : IJPR,2019 05 17,"In this work, we investigated the loading and conjugation of Curcumin on oleic acid (OA) and citric acid (CA) functionalized iron oxide nanoparticles and its applications in improving contrast in MRI.

FT-IR results confirmed functionalization with oleic acid and citric acid. Curcumin was loaded and conjugated with the Nano-Systems and the amount of Curcumin loaded was quantified using spectrophotometry at 419 nm wavelength. The impact of solvent on the loading of Curcumin was studied. The wt% of loaded Curcumin was found to be 0.189 wt% using dimethylformamide (DMF) whereas using a combination of water-ethanol (15% v/v), this increased to 56.149 wt%. T2 relaxation time was determined using a 1.5 Tesla MRI machine; results showed that the MNPs reduced T2. Cytotoxicity of Nano-Systems (NS) in MTT assay showed that concentrations higher than 80 μg/mL (CNS > 80 μg/mL) could lead to cancer cell death and low concentrations, up to 40 μg/mL (CNS < 40 μg/mL) could be evaluated for diagnostic purposes.",Enhanced Solubility and Bioavailability of Apigenin via Preparation of Solid Dispersions of Mesoporous Silica Nanoparticles.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089353,Iranian journal of pharmaceutical research : IJPR,2019 05 17,"In this study, a novel mesoporous silica nanoparticles drug carrier contributes to improving the solubility, dissolution, and the oral bioavailability of apigenin (AP). The apigenin of solid dispersion of mesoporous silica nanoparticles (AP-MSN) was prepared by physical absorption method and also, in-vitro drug release and in-vivo bioavailability performance were evaluated. Based on its solubility, the AP-MSN solid dispersion was prepared at the weight ratio of 1:1 to obtain the optimum solubility. The loading efficiency (LE), encapsulation efficiency (EE), and solubility of AP-MSN solid dispersion were 29.71%, 42.27%, and 25.11 µg/mL, respectively. SEM, TEM, BET, FTIR, XRD, DSC, and TG were also carried out. These results demonstrated that AP was good absorbed into the pores of MSN through physical absorption effect of MSN. The DMF residues of AP-MSN solid dispersion meet the ICH requirements. It was vital that the AP-MSN solid dispersion behaved well in-vitro and the accumulative release of AP-MSN solid dispersion was 2.37 times higher than that of raw AP. In-vivo study, the AP area under curve0-t was 8.32 times higher for the AP-MSN solid dispersion than that of raw AP, which indicated that the bioavailability of AP-MSN solid dispersion was greatly improved.

Several studies have shown that the encapsulation of pcDNA with PLGA nanoparticles (NPs) protects them against DNase enzyme action and increases the efficiency of gene delivery to the cells. The purpose of this study was to encapsulate pcDNA encoding IFN-λ1 (pIFN-λ1) with a simple and cost-effective method using PLGA NPs. The pIFN-λ1-loaded PLGA NPs were produced by a double-emulsion-solvent evaporation method and characterized in terms of size, size distribution, and zeta potential by DLS and morphologically by SEM and TEM. The bioactivity of NPs was also examined by fluorescent microscopy. The results showed that IFN-λ1 expressed by HEK293T cells could protect HepC-2 cells from the cytopathic effects of EMCV. The NPs were spherical in shape with a mean diameter of 380 ± 3 nm, a zeta potential of -3.3 ± 7.6 mV, an encapsulation efficiency of 75 ± 5%, and a loading capacity of 0.83 ± 0.06. The NPs were also bioactive and easily engulfed by RAW264.7 cells. The pIFN-λ1 could be sustainably released from NPs. Due to the facility and affordability of encapsulation of pIFN-λ1 in the PLGA NPs proposed in this study and the advantages of encapsulation by PLGA, it appeared rational to use pIFN-λ1-loaded NPs instead of naked pIFN-λ1 to determine other unexplained activities of this new cytokine or to use it as an alternative or adjunct to current IFN-α therapy.",Docetaxel-Loaded Mixed Micelles and Polymersomes Composed of Poly (caprolactone)-Poly (ethylene glycol) (PEG-PCL) and Poly (lactic acid)-Poly (ethylene glycol) (PEG-PLA): Preparation and In-vitro Characterization.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089351,Iranian journal of pharmaceutical research : IJPR,2019 05 17,"Microwave irradiation was used to synthesize poly (caprolactone)-poly (ethylene glycol) (PEG-PCL) and poly (lactic acid)-poly (ethylene glycol) (PEG-PLA) copolymers that are composed of biodegradable polymers including PEG, PLA, and PCL.

Single emulsion-solvent evaporation technique was applied for preparing the PEG-PLA and PEG-PCL mixed nanoparticles (micelles and polymersomes) with different proportions, including 0:1, 1:1, 3:1, 1:3, and 1:0. The unimodal gel permeation chromatography curve showed low polydispersity of the di-block copolymers. The in-vitro drug release curves of formulations were compared. Micelles and polymersomes of 75% PEG-PCL and 25% PEG-PLA (P5 and M5) have the lowest burst release (5%) at the same period compared to the other copolymers. The dynamic light scattering and TEM results clarified that the size and shape of the formulations are uniform. The cytotoxicity effect of P5 and M5 was evaluated in different cell lines. The best one was found to P5 with half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) between 1.48-11.79 µg/mL. The pro-apoptotic effect of P5 was confirmed with flow cytometry study. These mixed micelles (M5) and polymersomes (P5) was found to be superior formulations than non-mixed ones."

Through coordinated cellular behaviors (self-renewal, proliferation, and differentiation), stem cells are also pivotal to the homeostasis, repair, and regeneration of many adult tissues/organs and thus of great importance in regenerative medicine. Emerging evidence indicates that mitochondria are actively involved in the regulation of stem cell behaviors. Mitochondria undergo specific dynamics (biogenesis, fission, fusion, and mitophagy) during stem cell self-renewal, proliferation, and differentiation. The alteration of mitochondrial dynamics, fine-tuned by stem cell niche factors and stress signaling, has considerable impacts on stem cell behaviors. Here, we summarize the recent research progress on (1) how mitochondrial dynamics controls stem cell behaviors, (2) intrinsic and extrinsic factors that regulate mitochondrial dynamics, and (3) pharmacological regulators of mitochondrial dynamics and their therapeutic potential. This review emphasizes the metabolic control of stemness and differentiation and may shed light on potential new applications in stem cell-based therapy.",Study on the Dynamic Biological Characteristics of Human Bone Marrow Mesenchymal Stem Cell Senescence.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089337,Stem cells international,2019 05 17,To preliminary explore the senescent dynamic changes of the bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMMSCs) by human ageing and its possible mechanism.,Preconditioning of Human Dental Pulp Stem Cells with Leukocyte- and Platelet-Rich Fibrin-Derived Factors Does Not Enhance Their Neuroregenerative Effect.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089335,Stem cells international,2019 05 17,"Pathologies of the central nervous system are characterized by loss of brain tissue and neuronal function which cannot be adequately restored by endogenous repair processes. This stresses the need for novel treatment options such as cell-based therapies that are able to restore damaged tissue or stimulate repair. This study investigated the neuroregenerative potential of the conditioned medium of human dental pulp stem cells (CM-hDPSCs) on neural stem cell (NSC) proliferation and migration as well as on neurite outgrowth of primary cortical neurons (pCNs). Additionally, the effect of leukocyte- and platelet-rich fibrin (L-PRF) priming on the neuroregenerative potential of the hDPSC secretome on NSCs and pCNs was evaluated. L-PRF contains factors that enhance stem cell-induced regeneration, but its effect on hDPSC-mediated neuroregeneration is unknown. This study demonstrated that CM-hDPSCs enhanced neuritogenesis. Moreover, CM-hDPSCs had a chemoattractant effect on NSCs. Although priming hDPSCs with L-PRF increased brain-derived neurotrophic factor secretion, no additional effects on the paracrine-mediated repair mechanisms were observed. These data support the neuroregenerative potential of hDPSCs, and although priming had no additional effect, the potential of L-PRF-primed hDPSCs on distinct regenerative mechanisms remains to be clarified.",Neuregulin-1 Fosters Supportive Interactions between Microglia and Neural Stem/Progenitor Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089334,Stem cells international,2019 05 17,"Microglia play diverse roles in homeostasis and pathology of the central nervous system (CNS). Their response to injury or insult is critical for initiating neuroinflammation and tissue damage as well as resolution of inflammation and wound healing. Changes to the microenvironment of microglia appear to be a key determinant of their phenotype and their role in the endogenous repair process in the injured or diseased CNS. Our recent findings have identified a positive role for neuregulin-1 (Nrg-1) in regulating immune response in spinal cord injury and focal demyelinating lesions. We show that increasing the tissue availability of Nrg-1 after injury can promote endogenous repair by modulating neuroinflammation. In the present study, we sought to elucidate the specific role of Nrg-1 in regulating microglial activity and more importantly their influence on the behavior of neural stem/progenitor cells (NPCs). Using injury-relevant in vitro systems, we demonstrate that Nrg-1 attenuates the expression of proinflammatory mediators in activated microglia. Moreover, we provide novel evidence that availability of Nrg-1 can restore the otherwise suppressed phagocytic ability of proinflammatory microglia. Interestingly, the presence of Nrg-1 in the microenvironment of proinflammatory microglia mitigates their inhibitory effects on NPC proliferation. Nrg-1 treated proinflammatory microglia also augment mobilization of NPCs, while they had no influence on their suppressive effects on NPC differentiation. Mechanistically, we show that Nrg-1 enhances the interactions of proinflammatory microglia and NPCs, at least in part, through reduction of TNF-α expression in microglia. These findings provide new insights into the endogenous regulation of microglia-NPC interactions and identify new potential targets for optimizing this important crosstalk during the regenerative process after CNS injury and neuroinflammatory conditions.",Metastable Reprogramming State of Single Transcription Factor-Derived Induced Hepatocyte-Like Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089332,Stem cells international,2019 05 17,"We previously described the generation of induced hepatocyte-like cells (iHeps) using the hepatic transcription factor Hnf1a together with small molecules. These iHeps represent a hepatic state that is more mature compared with iHeps generated with multiple hepatic factors. However, the underlying mechanism of hepatic conversion involving transgene dependence of the established iHeps is largely unknown. Here, we describe the generation of transgene-independent iHeps by inducing the ectopic expression of Hnf1a using both an episomal vector and a doxycycline-inducible lentivirus. In contrast to iHeps with sustained expression of Hnf1a, transgene-independent Hnf1a iHeps lose their typical morphology and in vitro functionality with rapid downregulation of hepatic markers upon withdrawal of small molecules. Taken together, our data indicates that the reprogramming state of single factor Hnf1a-derived iHeps is metastable and that the hepatic identity of these cells could be maintained only by the continuous supply of either small molecules or the master hepatic factor Hnf1a. Our findings emphasize the importance of a factor screening strategy for inducing specific cellular identities with a stable reprogramming state in order to eventually translate direct conversion technology to the clinic.",Role of Toll-Like Receptors in Actuating Stem/Progenitor Cell Repair Mechanisms: Different Functions in Different Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089331,Stem cells international,2019 05 17,"Toll-like receptors (TLRs) represent one of the bridges that regulate the cross-talk between the innate and adaptive immune systems. TLRs interact with molecules shared and preserved by the pathogens of origin but also with endogenous molecules (damage/danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs)) that derive from injured tissues. This is probably why TLRs have been found to be expressed on several kinds of stem/progenitor cells (SCs). In these cells, the role of TLRs in the regulation of the basal motility, proliferation, differentiation processes, self-renewal, and immunomodulation has been demonstrated. In this review, we analyze the many different functions that the TLRs assume in SCs, pointing out that they can have different effects, depending on the background and on the kind of ligands that they recognize. Moreover, we discuss the TLR involvement in the response of SC to specific tissue damage and in the reparative processes, as well as how the identification of molecules mediating the differential function of TLR signaling could be decisive for the development of new therapeutic strategies. Considering the available studies on TLRs in SCs, here we address the importance of TLRs in sensing an injury by stem/progenitor cells and in determining their behavior and reparative activity, which is dependent on the conditions. Therefore, it could be conceivable that SCs employed in therapy could be potentially exposed to TLR ligands, which might modulate their therapeutic potential in vivo. In this context, to modulate SC proliferation, survival, migration, and differentiation in the pathological environment, we need to better understand the mechanisms of action of TLRs on SCs and learn how to control these receptors and their downstream pathways in a precise way. In this manner, in the future, cell therapy could be improved and made safer.",Mechanism of Action of Icariin in Bone Marrow Mesenchymal Stem Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089330,Stem cells international,2019 05 17,"Osteoporosis, femoral head necrosis, and congenital bone defects are orthopedic disorders characterized by reduced bone generation and insufficient bone mass.

Icariin (ICA) is the active ingredient of Herba epimedii, a common herb used in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) formulations, and can effectively enhance BMSC proliferation and osteogenesis. However, the underlying mechanism of ICA action in BMSCs is not completely clear. In this review, we provide an overview of the studies on the role and mechanism of action of ICA in BMSCs, to provide greater insights into its potential clinical use in bone regeneration.",Mesenchymal Progenitors Derived from Different Locations in Long Bones Display Diverse Characteristics.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089329,Stem cells international,2019 05 17,"Mesenchymal progenitors within bone marrow have multiple differentiation potential and play an essential role in the maintenance of adult skeleton homeostasis. Mesenchymal progenitors located in bone regions other than the bone marrow also display bone-forming properties. However, owing to the differences in each distinct microenvironment, the mesenchymal characteristics of skeletal progenitor cells within different regions of long bones may show some differences. In order to clearly elucidate these differences, we performed a comparative study on mesenchymal progenitors from different regions of long bones. Here, we isolated mesenchymal progenitors from the periosteum, endosteum, and bone marrow of rat long bones. The three groups exhibited similar cellular morphologies and expressed the typical surface markers associated with mesenchymal stem cells. Interestingly, after cell proliferation assays and bidirectional differentiation analysis, periosteal mesenchymal progenitors showed a higher proliferative ability and adipogenic differentiation potential. In contrast, endosteal mesenchymal progenitors were more prone to osteogenic differentiation. Using in vitro osteoclast culture systems, conditioned media from different mesenchymal progenitor cultures were used to induce osteoclastic differentiation. Osteoclast formation was found to be significantly promoted by the secretion of RANKL and IL-6 by endosteal progenitors. Overall, our results provide strong evidence for the importance of selecting the appropriate source of skeletal progenitors for applications in future skeleton regeneration therapies."

Since then, significant achievements have been reported in terms of our understanding of the biology of UCB-derived hematopoietic stem (HSCs) and progenitor (HPCs) cells. Over 40,000 UCB transplants (UCBTs) have been performed, in both children and adults, for the treatment of many different diseases, including hematologic, metabolic, immunologic, neoplastic, and neurologic disorders. In addition, cord blood banking has been developed to the point that around 800,000 units are being stored in public banks and more than 4 million units in private banks worldwide. During these 30 years, research in the UCB field has transformed the hematopoietic transplantation arena. Today, scientific and clinical teams are still working on different ways to improve and expand the use of UCB cells. A major effort has been focused on enhancing engraftment to potentially reduce risk of infection and cost. To that end, we have to understand in detail the molecular mechanisms controlling stem cell self-renewal that may lead to the development of ex vivo systems for HSCs expansion, characterize the mechanisms regulating the homing of HSCs and HPCs, and determine the relative place of UCBTs, as compared to other sources. These challenges will be met by encouraging innovative research on the basic biology of HSCs and HPCs, developing novel clinical trials, and improving UCB banking both in the public and private arenas.",Psychophysical effects of an exercise therapy during pediatric stem cell transplantation: a randomized controlled trial.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089282,Bone marrow transplantation,2019 05 16,"This study evaluates the physical and psychosocial effects of an inpatient exercise program for children and adolescents undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).

The median number of AZA cycles was 5 (1-12) with 10 patients (33%) completing the 12 projected cycles. DLI were performed in 17 patients: 5 received one DLI, 2 received 2 DLI and 8 received 3 infusions. AZA was well tolerated, but discontinued in 20 patients primarily due to graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) and relapse. The cumulative incidence (CI) of grade 1-3 acute GvHD was 31.5% and the chronic GvHD CI was 53% at 2 years. At a median follow-up of 49 months (27-63), 18 patients are alive. The overall and disease-free survivals are 65.5% (CI 95% = 48.2-82.8) at 2 years. Cause of death was mainly relapse for 9 patients.

Acute (n = 355/49.2%) and chronic (n = 269/37.3%) GvHD were mainly treated by steroids in first-line therapy. The proportion of steroid refractory aGvHD and cGvHD was 35.7% and 31.4%, respectively. As there is no standard therapy for steroid refractory GvHD, a range of different agents was used. In aGvHD, the overall response rate (ORR) of steroid refractory GvHD to second-line treatment was 27.4%. Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and mTOR inhibitors led to superior response rates (ORR 50.0% and 53.3%, respectively). In steroid refractory cGvHD therapy, ORR was 44.4%.

We evaluated 40 patients who underwent HSCT with different types of conditioning regimens. After one dose, in the Bu-Oral group (n = 21), the median AUC was 1174 µMol min (799-4000), reaching a median of 4440 µMol min (3428-7181.5) during conditioning in 24 h.

Measuring plasma concentration of Bu in patients undergoing HSCT is important, regardless of the formulation, and the inclusion of a pre-HSCT test can predict the optimal dose during conditioning. Pharmacokinetics of the oral administration of busulfan, as well as clearance, are extremely variable, and this can potentially compromise the clinical results of the treatment since it makes it difficult to predict clinical results.",PALB2 c.2257C>T truncating variant is a Greek founder and is associated with high breast cancer risk.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089269,Journal of human genetics,2019 05 15,"PALB2 loss-of-function variants play an important role in breast, pancreatic and possibly, ovarian and gastric cancer susceptibility. Their frequency can be influenced by founder effects, already described in some populations. Herein, we have assessed the possible founder effect of PALB2 c.2257C>T (p.Arg753*) truncating variant among Greek breast cancer patients, while investigating possible correlations with cancer diagnoses. Following a lead deriving from a background study of highly selected Greek breast cancer patients, a total of 2496 breast and 697 ovarian cancer patients were directly genotyped for the PALB2 c.2257C>T truncating variant. Consequently, haplotype analysis was conducted on identified carriers, using seven microsatellite markers. The prevalence of the PALB2 variant was 0.24% (6/2496) and 0.14% (1/697) among breast and ovarian cases, respectively. Family history seems to be an important factor for the variant identification, although not reaching statistical significance. Microsatellite analysis on 12 carriers revealed a common shared haplotype, spanning a chromosomal region of ~1.2 Mb; the variant was possibly introduced in the Greek population ~1600 years ago. The variant confers high breast cancer risk, as illustrated by comparison with publicly available control groups. Genetic testing for PALB2, especially for the Greek founder c.2257C>T truncating variant, should be seriously considered in Greek breast cancer cases, since such findings could assist appropriate clinical management for the patients and their families.",Development of an MSI-positive colon tumor with aberrant DNA methylation in a PPAP patient.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089268,Journal of human genetics,2019 05 15,"Polymerase proofreading-associated polyposis (PPAP) is a disease caused by germline variations in the POLE and POLD1 genes that encode catalytic subunits of DNA polymerases. Studies of cancer genomes have identified somatic mutations in these genes, suggesting the importance of polymerase proofreading of DNA replication in suppressing tumorigenesis. Here, we identified a germline frameshift variation in the POLE gene (c.4191_4192delCT, p.Tyr1398*) in a case with multiple adenomatous polyps and three synchronous colon cancers. Interestingly, one of the colon cancers showed microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) and another microsatellite stable. Immunohistochemical staining revealed that the MSI-H tumor cells lost the expression of MLH1 protein. Whole genome sequencing of the MSI-H tumor did not find pathogenic somatic mutations in mismatch repair genes but found frameshift mutations in the TET genes that catalyze 5-methylcytosine hydroxylation. Bisulfite sequencing of the tumor corroborated an increase in the number of hypermethylated regions including the MLH1 promoter. These data indicate that PPAP patients might develop MSI-positive tumors through epigenetic silencing of MLH1. These findings will contribute to comprehensive understanding of the molecular basis of tumors that involve deficiency of proofreading activity of DNA polymerases.",MicroRNAs profiling in fibroblasts derived from patients with Gorlin syndrome.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089267,Journal of human genetics,2019 05 15,"Gorlin syndrome (GS) is a hereditary disorder with tumorigenicity, caused by constitutive hyperactivity of hedgehog signaling. Smoothened (SMO) antagonists have been effectively used in the clinical treatment of hedgehog signaling-related cancer. However, these treatments have led to problematic side effects, including severe adverse reactions and drug resistance from additional somatic mutations. We profiled microRNAs in GS fibroblasts to explore a novel therapeutic target for controlling hyper-activated hedgehog signaling. To identify GS-related microRNAs, we analyzed dermal fibroblasts from five patients with GS and three normal controls. We used microarray comparative genomic hybridization to screen 632 human microRNAs in GS fibroblasts. We identified 16 down- and 19 upregulated microRNAs with over twofold change in expression. We validated the increased expression of four microRNAs, confirming hsa-miR-196a-5p downregulation and hsa-miR-4485 upregulation using real-time PCR. Moreover, hsa-miR-196a-5p is complementary to sites in the 3' UTR of MAP3K1, which exhibits upregulated expression at mRNA and protein levels in GS fibroblasts. In addition, hedgehog signal induction with exogenous components decreased miR-196a-5p expression and increased map3k1 expression in a mouse mesenchymal cell line. Given that MAP3K1 has been reported to activate hedgehog signaling, hsa-miR-196a-5p may contribute to the positive feedback loop in this pathway.",Sex-specific roles of cellular inflammation and cardiometabolism in obesity-associated depressive symptomatology.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089263,International journal of obesity (2005),2019 05 16,"Obesity and depression are complex conditions with stronger comorbid relationships among women than men.

One strategy to reduce the adverse effects is targeted therapy that can selectively deliver anticancer drugs to tumor cells. Immature laminin receptor protein (OFA/iLRP) is a potential target for AML treatment, because it is over-expressed on the surface of AML cells but under-expressed in normal tissue. In this study, we developed the first aptamer for OFA/iLRP and explored its potential as a targeting ligand for delivery of doxorubicin (Dox) to AML cells in vitro. The selected aptamer (AB3) was a 59-base DNA oligonucleotides. It bound to OFA/iLRP structure with a Kd of 101 nM and had minimal cross-reactivity to albumin, trypsin, or ovalbumin. Moreover, AB3 could bind to OFA/iLRP-positive AML cells but not the OFA/iLRP-negative control cells. An aptamer-doxorubicin (Apt-Dox) complex was formed by intercalating doxorubicin into the DNA structure of AB3. Apt-Dox selectively delivered Dox to OFA/iLRP-positive AML cells but notably decreased the drug intake by OFA/iLRP-negative control cells. In addition, cytotoxicity study revealed that Apt-Dox efficaciously destroyed the OFA/iLRP-positive AML cells, but significantly reduced the damage to control cells. The results indicate that the OFA/iLRP aptamer AB3 may have application potential in targeted therapy against AML.",The mutational burden of therapy-related myeloid neoplasms is similar to primary myelodysplastic syndrome but has a distinctive distribution.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089247,Leukemia,2019 05 15,"Therapy-related myeloid neoplasms (T-MN) are poorly characterized secondary hematological malignancies following chemotherapy/radiotherapy exposure. We compared the clinical and mutational characteristics of T-MN (n = 129) and primary myelodysplastic syndrome (P-MDS, n = 108) patients. Although the somatic mutation frequency was similar between T-MN and P-MDS patients (93% in both groups), the pattern was distinct. TP53 mutations were more frequent in T-MN (29.5 vs. 7%), while spliceosomal complex mutations were more common in P-MDS (56.5 vs. 25.6%). In contrast to P-MDS, the ring sideroblasts (RS) phenotype was not associated with better survival in T-MN, most probably due to genetic association with TP53 mutations. SF3B1 was mutated in 96% of P-MDS with ≥15% RS, but in only 32% T-MN. TP53 mutations were detected in 92% T-MN with ≥15% RS and SF3B1 wild-type cases. Interestingly, T-MN and P-MDS patients with ""Very low"" or ""Low"" Revised International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS-R) showed similar biological and clinical characteristics. In a Cox regression analysis, TP53 mutation was a poor prognostic factor in T-MN, independent of IPSS-R cytogenetics, disease-modifying therapy, and NRAS mutation. Our data have direct implications for T-MN management and provide evidence that, in addition to conventional disease parameters, mutational analysis should be incorporated in T-MN risk stratification.",Estimating the time-varying generation rate of acetic acid from an all-purpose floor cleaner.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089245,Journal of exposure science & environmental epidemiology,2019 05 16,"Understanding the relationship between consumer product use and risk of adverse health outcomes facilitates appropriate risk management and product stewardship. A preferred method for estimating the systemic and respiratory tract exposure and dose tailored to cleaning products use has been proposed, refining previously issued exposure guidance. Consistent with other exposure and risk-assessment frameworks, it is dependent upon high-quality exposure determinant data that also serve as model inputs. However, as publicly available exposure determinant data are scarce, the risk assessor is left with the option of estimating determinants such as the generation rate or employing empirical methods to estimate them. When the exposure scenario involves a chemical mixture, estimating the generation rate may not be feasible. We present an approach for estimating the time-varying generation rate of an aqueous acetic acid mixture representative of the base formulation for many consumer and DIY cleaning products that was previously assessed in a screening-level assessment. The approach involved measuring the evaporation rate for a reasonable worst-case scenario under controlled conditions. Knowing the mass applied, a time-varying generation rate was estimated. To evaluate its portability, a field study was conducted in a home where measurements were collected in an all-purpose room with the exterior door open (Room 1) and closed (Room 2), and a bathroom (Room 3) using a portable Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectrophotometer. Acetic acid concentrations were modeled using two common indoor air models, the Well Mixed Room model. Measured and modeled acetic acid concentrations were compared, with the WMR 95% confidence intervals encompassing measured concentrations for all three rooms, supporting the utility of the approach used and portability of the generation rate derived from it.","Urinary and hair concentrations of trace metals in pregnant women from Northeastern British Columbia, Canada: a pilot study.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089244,Journal of exposure science & environmental epidemiology,2019 05 16,"Northeastern British Columbia (Canada) is an area of intense natural gas exploitation by hydraulic fracturing.

Such a coupling is negligible for the lowest energy levels of a trapped ion but it is important for a trapped Rydberg ion due to its large electric quadrupole moment. This coupling cannot be neglected by the standard rotating-wave approximation because it is comparable to the frequency of the trapping electric field. We investigate the effect of the quadrupole coupling by performing a suitable effective representation of the Hamiltonian. For a single ion we show that in this effective picture the quadrupole interaction is replaced by rescaled laser intensities and additional Stark shifts of the Rydberg levels. Hence this detrimental quadrupole coupling can be efficiently compensated by an appropriate increase of the Rabi frequencies. Moreover, we consider the strong dipole-dipole interaction between a pair of Rydberg ions in the presence of the quadrupole coupling. In the effective representation we observe reducing of the dipole-dipole coupling as well as additional spin-spin interaction.",The HuR CMLD-2 inhibitor exhibits antitumor effects via MAD2 downregulation in thyroid cancer cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089242,Scientific reports,2019 06 10,"Hu antigen R (HuR) is indeed one of the most studied RNA-binding protein (RBP) since its fundamental role both in tumorigenesis and cancer progression. For this reason, downregulation in HuR protein levels or inhibition of HuR biological function are, nowadays, attractive goals in cancer research. Here, we examined the antitumor effects of CMLD-2 in four thyroid cancer cell lines (SW1736, 8505 C, BCPAP and K1). Indeed, CMLD-2 competitively binds HuR protein disrupting its interaction with RNA-targets. 35 μM CLMD-2 produced a significant downregulation in thyroid cancer cell viability, coupled to an increase in apoptosis. Moreover, CMLD-2 treatment hindered both migration and colony formation ability. MAD2 is a microtubules-associated protein known to be greatly overexpressed in cancer and correlating with tumor aggressiveness. Furthermore, MAD2 is known to be a HuR target. CMLD-2 treatment induced a strong MAD2 downregulation and rescue experiments depicted it as a key effector in HuR-mediated in cancer. Altogether, these data contributed to foster HuR inhibition as valid antineoplastic treatment in thyroid cancer, highlighting MAD2 as a novel therapeutic target.",Tailoring optical properties and stimulated emission in nanostructured polythiophene.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089241,Scientific reports,2019 06 10,"Polythiophenes are the most widely utilized semiconducting polymers in organic electronics, but they are scarcely exploited in photonics due to their high photo-induced absorption caused by interchain polaron pairs, which prevents the establishment of a window of net optical gain. Here we study the photophysics of poly(3-hexylthiophene) configured with different degrees of supramolecular ordering, spin-coated thin films and templated nanowires, and find marked differences in their optical properties. Transient absorption measurements evidence a partially-polarized stimulated emission band in the nanowire samples, in contrast with the photo-induced absorption band observed in spin-coated thin films. In combination with theoretical modeling, our experimental results reveal the origin of the primary photoexcitations dominating the dynamics for different supramolecular ordering, with singlet excitons in the nanostructured samples superseding the presence of polaron pairs, which are present in the disordered films. Our approach demonstrates a viable strategy to direct optical properties through structural control, and the observation of optical gain opens the possibility to the use of polythiophene nanostructures as building blocks of organic optical amplifiers and active photonic devices.",Evaluation of lipid oxidation mechanisms in beverages and cosmetics via analysis of lipid hydroperoxide isomers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089240,Scientific reports,2019 06 10,"Understanding of lipid oxidation mechanisms (e.g., auto-oxidation and photo-oxidation) in foods and cosmetics is deemed essential to maintain the quality of such products. In this study, the oxidation mechanisms in foods and cosmetics were evaluated through analysis of linoleic acid hydroperoxide (LAOOH) and linoleic acid ethyl ester hydroperoxide (ELAOOH) isomers. Based on our previous method for analysis of LAOOH isomers, in this study, we developed a new HPLC-MS/MS method that enables analysis of ELAOOH isomers. The HPLC-MS/MS methods to analyze LAOOH and ELOOH isomers were applied to food (liquor) and cosmetic (skin cream) samples. As a result, LAOOH and ELAOOH isomers specific to photo-oxidation, and ELAOOH isomers characteristic to auto-oxidation were detected in some marketed liquor samples, suggesting that lipid oxidation of marketed liquor proceeds by both photo- and auto-oxidation during the manufacturing process and/or sales. In contrast, because only LAOOH and ELAOOH isomers specific to auto-oxidation were detected in skin cream stored under dark at different temperatures (-5 °C-40 °C) for different periods (2-15 months), auto-oxidation was considered to be the major oxidation mechanism in such samples. Therefore, our HPLC-MS/MS methods appear to be powerful tools to elucidate lipid oxidation mechanisms in food and cosmetic products.",Genome-wide association study of right-sided colonic diverticulosis in a Korean population.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089239,Scientific reports,2019 06 10,"Diverticulosis results from complex interactions related to aging, environmental factors and genetic predisposition.

A GWAS was carried out in 7,948 healthy individuals: 893 patients and 1,075 controls comprised the test set, and 346 patients and 305 controls comprised the replication set. Diverticulosis was diagnosed by colonoscopy during comprehensive medical check-ups, and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) related to diverticulosis were detected with the Affymetrix Axiom KORV1.1-96 Array. In all, 9 SNPs were identified in three SNP aggregates in the test set (P < 10-3, within 200 kb) after adjusting for sex. All the SNPs were replicated in the replication set (P < 0.05). Three SNPs were near the WNT4 gene, four near the RHOU gene, and two in the OAS1/3 genes.

Sixty-eight self-reported or witnessed snoring patients and 609 non-snoring patients diagnosed with PA between 2010 and 2015 were recruited in this retrospective study. Compared to non-snoring patients, snoring patients had significantly (P < 0.05) higher body mass index (BMI), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and serum and urinary sodium, as well as lower estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Moreover, snoring patients exhibited significantly (P < 0.01) higher plasma renin activity levels and lower plasma aldosterone levels and aldosterone-to-renin activity ratios (ARRs) than patients with PA alone. When age, sex, duration of hypertension, and BMI were matched between groups, snoring patients still showed significantly (P < 0.05) higher plasma renin activity, serum and urinary sodium, and lower ARR and eGFR than those in the PA-only group. All 68 snoring patients underwent polysomnography, with 7 having mild (apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) ≥ 5 and <15), 21 moderate (AHI ≥ 15 and <30), and 40 severe (AHI ≥ 30) OSAS. The BMI of patients with OSAS was negatively correlated with the lowest SaO2 (r = -0.318, P = 0.018) but not with the AHI. In conclusion, snoring patients with PA tend to have increased BMI and DBP, as well as decreased eGFR and ARR. Snoring patients with PA had higher prevalence of moderate-to-severe OSAS.",Effects of exogenous sulfur on alleviating cadmium stress in tartary buckwheat.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089197,Scientific reports,2019 06 10,"Supplying exogenous sulfur-rich compounds increases the content of glutathione(GSH) and phytochelatins(PCs) in plant tissues, enabling plants to enhance their cellular defense capacity and/or compartmentalize Cadmium(Cd) into vacuoles. However, the mechanism by which surplus S modulates tolerance to Cd stress in different tissues need further investigation. In the present study, we found that supplementing the tartary buckwheat(Fagopyrum tararicum) exposed to Cd with surplus S reversed Cd induced adverse effects, and increased Cd concentrations in roots, but decreased in leaves. Further analysis revealed that exogenous S significantly mitigated Cd-induced oxidative stress with the aids of antioxidant enzymes and agents both in leaves and roots, including peroxidase(POD), ascorbate peroxidase(APX), glutathione peroxidase(GPX), glutathione S-transferase(GST), ascorbic acid(AsA), and GSH, but not superoxide dismutase(SOD) and catalase(CAT). The increased Cd uptake in root vacuoles and decreased translocation in leaves of exogenous S treated plants could be ascribed to the increasing Cd binding on cell walls, chelation and vacuolar sequestration with helps of non-protein thiols(NPT), PCs and heavy metal ATPase 3(FtHMA3) in roots, and inhibiting expression of FtHMA2, a transporter that helps Cd translocation from roots to shoots. Results provide the fundamental information for the application of exogenous S in reversal of heavy metal stress.",Temporal escalation of Pyrethroid Resistance in the major malaria vector Anopheles coluzzii from Sahelo-Sudanian Region of northern Nigeria.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089196,Scientific reports,2019 06 10,"Despite the highest global burden of malaria, information on bionomics and insecticide resistance status of malaria vectors is grossly lacking in the densely populated Sahelo-Sudanian region of Nigeria. To support evidence-based vector control we characterised transmission and resistance profiles of Anopheles coluzzii populations from three sites in northern Nigeria. High sporozoite infection (~19.51%) was found in the An. coluzzii populations. A high pyrethroid resistance was observed with only 1% mortality against deltamethrin, a high LD50 (96.57 µg/ml), and a high LT50 (170.27 min, resistance ratio of ~51 compared with the fully susceptible Ngoussou colony). Moderate carbamate resistance was observed. Synergist bioassays significantly recovered deltamethrin susceptibility implicating CYP450s (mortality = 85%, χ2 = 134.04, p < 0.0001) and esterases (mortality = 56%, χ2 = 47.31, p < 0.0001). Reduced bed net efficacy was also observed, with mortalities on exposure to the roof of PermaNet3.0 (PBO + deltamethrin) more than 22 times compared to the side panel (deltamethrin). TaqMan genotyping revealed a high frequency of 1014F kdr mutation (82%) with significant difference in genotype distribution associated with permethrin resistance [OR = 4.69 (CI:1.53-14.35, χ2 = 8.22 p = 0.004]. Sequencing of exons 18-21 of the VGSC led to detection of two additional nonsynonymous mutations, Ile10148Asn and Ser1156Gly. These findings highlight the threats posed by the highly resistant An. coluzzii to malaria control in Nigeria.",mGluR1 in cerebellar Purkinje cells is essential for the formation but not expression of associative eyeblink memory.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089195,Scientific reports,2019 06 10,"Classical eyeblink conditioning is a representative associative motor learning that requires both the cerebellar cortex and the deep cerebellar nucleus (DCN). Metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 1 (mGluR1) is richly expressed in Purkinje cells (PCs) of the cerebellar cortex. Global mGluR1 knock-out (KO) mice show a significantly lower percentage of conditioned response (CR%) than wild-type mice in eyeblink conditioning, and the impaired CR% is restored by the introduction of mGluR1 in PCs. However, the specific roles of mGluR1 in major memory processes, including formation, storage and expression have not yet been defined. We thus examined the role of mGluR1 in these processes of eyeblink conditioning, using mGluR1 conditional KO (cKO) mice harboring a selective and reversible expression of mGluR1 in PCs. We have found that eyeblink memory is not latently formed in the absence of mGluR1 in adult mouse PCs. However, once acquired, eyeblink memory is expressed even after the depletion of mGluR1 in PCs. We thus conclude that mGluR1 in PCs is indispensable for the formation of eyeblink memory, while it is not required for the expression of CR.",A de novo transcriptome assembly approach elucidates the dynamics of ovarian maturation in the swordfish (Xiphias gladius).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089194,Scientific reports,2019 06 10,"The Mediterranean swordfish (Xiphias gladius) has been recently classified as overfished and in 2016, the International Commission for the Conservation of the Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) established a multi-annual management plan to recover this stock. To successfully achieve this goal, knowledge about swordfish biology is needed. To date, few studies on swordfish have been performed and none of them has provided useful insights into the reproductive biology at molecular level. Here we set to characterise the molecular dynamics underlying ovarian maturation by employing a de novo transcriptome assembly approach. Differential gene expression analysis in mature and immature ovaries identified a number of differentially expressed genes associated with biological processes driving ovarian maturation. Focusing on ovarian steroidogenesis and vitellogenin uptake, we depict the molecular dynamics characterizing these processes while a phylogenetic analysis let us identify a candidate vitellogenin receptor. This is the first swordfish transcriptome assembly and these findings provide in-depth understanding of molecular processes describing ovarian maturation. Moreover, the establishment of a publicly available database containing information on the swordfish transcriptome aims to boost research on this species with the long-term of developing more comprehensive and successful stock management plans.",Directional coupling of surface plasmon polaritons at complementary split-ring resonators.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089193,Scientific reports,2019 06 10,We propose a complementary split-ring resonator (CSRR) for a directional coupling of surface plasmon polaritons. An air-slot split-ring in a gold film is investigated using the finite-difference time-domain method. The normally incident light couples to either a monopole or a dipole SPP depending on the polarization of light. Adjusting the angle of the linear polarization of the incident light enables a one-way propagation of SPPs on the gold film. Theoretical analysis based on the propagation of cylindrical waves from the SPP point source is provided with Hankel function. The propagated power in one direction is obtained to be 30 times higher than the opposite direction with a coupling efficiency of 18.2% from the simulation for an array of the CSRRs. This approach to the directional coupling of SPPs will be advantageous for miniaturizing photonic and plasmonic circuits and devices.,Excitation-inhibition balance as a framework for investigating mechanisms in neuropsychiatric disorders.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089192,Molecular psychiatry,2019 05 15,"In 2003 Rubenstein and Merzenich hypothesized that some forms of Autism (ASD) might be caused by a reduction in signal-to-noise in key neural circuits, which could be the result of changes in excitatory-inhibitory (E-I) balance. Here, we have clarified the concept of E-I balance, and updated the original hypothesis in light of the field's increasingly sophisticated understanding of neuronal circuits. We discuss how specific developmental mechanisms, which reduce inhibition, affect cortical and hippocampal functions. After describing how mutations of some ASD genes disrupt inhibition in mice, we close by suggesting that E-I balance represents an organizing framework for understanding findings related to pathophysiology and for identifying appropriate treatments.",In silico prediction of housekeeping long intergenic non-coding RNAs reveals HKlincR1 as an essential player in lung cancer cell survival.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089191,Scientific reports,2019 06 10,"Prioritising long intergenic noncoding RNAs (lincRNAs) for functional characterisation is a significant challenge. Here we applied computational approaches to discover lincRNAs expected to play a critical housekeeping (HK) role within the cell. Using the Illumina Human BodyMap RNA sequencing dataset as a starting point, we first identified lincRNAs ubiquitously expressed across a panel of human tissues. This list was then further refined by reference to conservation score, secondary structure and promoter DNA methylation status. Finally, we used tumour expression and copy number data to identify lincRNAs rarely downregulated or deleted in multiple tumour types. The resulting list of candidate essential lincRNAs was then subjected to co-expression analyses using independent data from ENCODE and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). This identified a substantial subset with a predicted role in DNA replication and cell cycle regulation. One of these, HKlincR1, was selected for further characterisation. Depletion of HKlincR1 affected cell growth in multiple lung cancer cell lines, and led to disruption of genes involved in cell growth and viability. In addition, HKlincR1 expression was correlated with overall survival in lung adenocarcinoma patients. Our in silico studies therefore reveal a set of housekeeping noncoding RNAs of interest both in terms of their role in normal homeostasis, and their relevance in tumour growth and maintenance.",The role that choice of model plays in predictions for epilepsy surgery.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089190,Scientific reports,2019 06 10,"Mathematical modelling has been widely used to predict the effects of perturbations to brain networks. An important example is epilepsy surgery, where the perturbation in question is the removal of brain tissue in order to render the patient free of seizures. Different dynamical models have been proposed to represent transitions to ictal states in this context. However, our choice of which mathematical model to use to address this question relies on making assumptions regarding the mechanism that defines the transition from background to the seizure state. Since these mechanisms are unknown, it is important to understand how predictions from alternative dynamical descriptions compare. Herein we evaluate to what extent three different dynamical models provide consistent predictions for the effect of removing nodes from networks. We show that for small, directed, connected networks the three considered models provide consistent predictions. For larger networks, predictions are shown to be less consistent. However consistency is higher in networks that have sufficiently large differences in ictogenicity between nodes. We further demonstrate that heterogeneity in ictogenicity across nodes correlates with variability in the number of connections for each node.",Analysis of systemic lupus erythematosus-related interstitial pneumonia: a retrospective multicentre study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089189,Scientific reports,2019 06 10,"Thoracic diseases in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), especially interstitial pneumonia (SLE-IP), are rare and have been poorly studied. The aims of this multicentre study were to evaluate SLE-IP and elucidate its clinical characteristics and prognosis. Fifty-five patients with SLE-IP who had attended the respiratory departments of participating hospitals were retrospectively evaluated in this multicentre study. Clinical information, high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT), and surgical lung biopsy/autopsy specimens were analysed by respiratory physicians, pulmonary radiologists, and pulmonary pathologists. IP patterns on HRCT and lung specimens were classified based on the international classification statement/guideline for idiopathic interstitial pneumonias. The most frequent form of SLE-IP at diagnosis was chronic IP (63.6%), followed by subacute (20.0%), and acute IP (12.7%). Radiologically, the most common HRCT pattern was ""Unclassifiable"" (54%). Histologically, ""Unclassifiable"" was the most frequently found (41.7%) among 12 patients with histologically proven IP. Interestingly, accompanying airway diseases were present in nine of these patients (75%). In multivariate analysis, current smoking (hazard ratio [HR] 6.105, p = 0.027), thrombocytopenia (HR 7.676, p = 0.010), anti-double-strand DNA titre (HR 0.956, p = 0.027), and nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP) + organizing pneumonia (OP) pattern on HRCT (vs. NSIP, HR 0.089, p = 0.023) were significant prognostic factors. In conclusion, chronic IP was the most frequent form of IP in patients with SLE-IP, and ""Unclassifiable"" was the commonest pattern radiologically and histologically."

A distinct decrease in the amount of residual 2,3-naphthyridine was observed in the samples recovered after reaction at ˃523 K at 0.5 and 1.0 GPa, and ˃548 K at 1.5 GPa. The formation of o-xylene and o-tolunitrile accompanied a decreasing N/C ratio of the reaction products, indicating decomposition of the aromatic ring and release of nitrogen. Precise analysis of the reaction products indicated the oligomerization of decomposed products with the residual 2,3-naphthyridine to form larger molecules up to 7mers. Nitrogen in the aromatic ring accelerated reactions to decompose the molecule and to oligomerize at lower temperatures than those typically reported for aromatic hydrocarbon oligomerization. The major reaction mechanism was similar between 0.5 and 1.5 GPa, although larger products preferentially formed in the samples at higher pressure.",A biological function based biomarker panel optimization process.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089177,Scientific reports,2019 06 10,"Implementation of multi-gene biomarker panels identified from high throughput data, including microarray or next generation sequencing, need to be adapted to a platform suitable in a clinical setting such as quantitative polymerase chain reaction. However, technical challenges when transitioning from one measurement platform to another, such as inconsistent measurement results can affect panel development. We describe a process to overcome the challenges by replacing poor performing genes during platform transition and reducing the number of features without impacting classification performance. This approach assumes that a diagnostic panel reflects the effect of dysregulated biological processes associated with a disease, and genes involved in the same biological processes and coordinately affected by a disease share a similar discriminatory power. The utility of this optimization process was assessed using a published sepsis diagnostic panel. Substitution of more than half of the genes and/or reducing genes based on biological processes did not negatively affect the performance of the sepsis diagnostic panel. Our results suggest a systematic gene substitution and reduction process based on biological function can be used to alleviate the challenges associated with clinical development of biomarker panels.",High dispersal levels and lake warming are emergent drivers of cyanobacterial community assembly in peri-Alpine lakes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089175,Scientific reports,2019 06 10,"Disentangling the relative importance of deterministic and stochastic processes in shaping natural communities is central to ecology. Studies about community assembly over broad temporal and spatial scales in aquatic microorganisms are scarce. Here, we used 16S rDNA sequence data from lake sediments to test for community assembly patterns in cyanobacterial phylogenies across ten European peri-Alpine lakes and over a century of eutrophication and climate warming. We studied phylogenetic similarity in cyanobacterial assemblages over spatial and temporal distance, and over environmental gradients, comparing detected patterns with theoretical expectations from deterministic and stochastic processes. We found limited evidence for deviation of lake communities from a random assembly model and no significant effects of geographic distance on phylogenetic similarity, suggesting no dispersal limitation and high levels of stochastic assembly. We detected a weak influence of phosphorus, but no significant effect of nitrogen levels on deviation of community phylogenies from random. We found however a significant decay of phylogenetic similarity for non-random communities over a gradient of air temperature and water column stability. We show how phylogenetic data from sedimentary archives can improve our understanding of microbial community assembly processes, and support previous evidence that climate warming has been the strongest environmental driver of cyanobacterial community assembly over the past century.",A self-assembled plasmonic optical fiber nanoprobe for label-free biosensing.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089174,Scientific reports,2019 06 10,"The plasmonic optical fiber sensors have attracted wide attention for label-free biosensing application because of their high integration, small footprint and point-of-care measurement. However, the integration of plasmonic nanostructures on optical fiber probes always relies on the top-down nanofabrication approaches, which have several inherent shortcomings, including high cost, time-consuming, and low yields. Here, we develop a plasmonic nanohole-patterned multimode optical fiber probe by self-assembly nanosphere lithography technique with low fabrication cost and high yields. The multimode optical fiber possesses large facet area and high numerical aperture, which not only simplifies fabrication process, but also increases coupling efficiency of incident light. Originating from the resonant coupling of plasmonic modes, the plasmonic fiber nanoprobe has a distinct reflection dip in the spectrum and exhibits strong near-field electromagnetic enhancement. We experimentally investigate the sensing performances of plasmonic fiber nanoprobe, and further demonstrate it in real-time monitoring specific binding of protein molecules. The experimental results imply that the nanohole-patterned multimode optical fiber probe is a good candidate for developing miniaturized and portable biosensing systems.",Regional Wind Variability Modulates the Southern Ocean Carbon Sink.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089173,Scientific reports,2019 06 10,"The Southern Ocean south of 35°S accounts for approximately half of the annual oceanic carbon uptake, thereby substantially mitigating the effects of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. The intensity of this important carbon sink varies considerably on inter-annual to decadal timescales. However, the drivers of this variability are still debated, challenging our ability to accurately predict the future role of the Southern Ocean in absorbing atmospheric carbon. Analysing mapped sea-air CO2 fluxes, estimated from upscaled surface ocean CO2 measurements, we find that the overall Southern Ocean carbon sink has weakened since ~2011, reversing the trend of the reinvigoration period of the 2000s. Although we find significant regional positive and negative responses of the Southern Ocean carbon uptake to changes in the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) over the past 35 years, the net effect of the SAM on the Southern Ocean carbon sink variability is approximately zero, due to the opposing effects of enhanced outgassing in upwelling regions and enhanced carbon uptake elsewhere. Instead, regional shifts in sea level pressure, linked to zonal wavenumber 3 (ZW3) and related changes in surface winds substantially contribute to the inter-annual to decadal variability of the Southern Ocean carbon sink.",Kinesin-6 Klp9 plays motor-dependent and -independent roles in collaboration with Kinesin-5 Cut7 and the microtubule crosslinker Ase1 in fission yeast.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089172,Scientific reports,2019 06 10,"Bipolar mitotic spindles play a critical part in accurate chromosome segregation. During late mitosis, spindle microtubules undergo drastic elongation in a process called anaphase B. Two kinesin motors, Kinesin-5 and Kinesin-6, are thought to generate outward forces to drive spindle elongation, and the microtubule crosslinker Ase1/PRC1 maintains structural integrity of antiparallel microtubules. However, how these three proteins orchestrate this process remains unknown. Here we explore the functional interplay among fission yeast Kinesin-5/Cut7, Kinesin-6/Klp9 and Ase1. Using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy, we show that Klp9 forms homotetramers and that Klp9 is a processive plus end-directed motor. klp9Δase1Δ is synthetically lethal. Surprisingly, this lethality is not ascribable to the defective motor activity of Klp9; instead, it is dependent upon a nuclear localisation signal and coiled coil domains within the non-motor region. We isolated a cut7 mutant (cut7-122) that displays temperature sensitivity only in the absence of Klp9. Interestingly, cut7-122 alone is impaired in spindle elongation during anaphase B, and furthermore, cut7-122klp9Δ double mutants exhibit additive defects. We propose that Klp9 plays dual roles during anaphase B; one is motor-dependent that collaborates with Cut7 in force generation, while the other is motor-independent that ensures structural integrity of spindle microtubules together with Ase1.",COPII proteins exhibit distinct subdomains within each ER exit site for executing their functions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089171,Scientific reports,2019 06 10,"Secretory proteins are exported from special domains of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) termed ER exit sites, via COPII-coated carriers. We recently showed that TANGO1 and Sec16 cooperatively organize mammalian ER exit sites for efficient secretion. However, the detailed spatial organization of mammalian ER exit sites is yet to be revealed. Here, we used super-resolution confocal live imaging microscopy (SCLIM) to investigate the localization of endogenous proteins, and we identified domains abundant in transmembrane complexes (TANGO1/cTAGE5/Sec12) juxtaposed to Sec16. Interestingly, this domain can be distinguished from the inner and the outer coats of COPII proteins within each mammalian ER exit site. Cargoes are partially concentrated in the domain for secretion. Our results suggest that mammalian ER exit sites compartmentalize proteins according to their function in COPII vesicle formation.",Reduced FcRn-mediated transcytosis of IgG2 due to a missing Glycine in its lower hinge.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089170,Scientific reports,2019 06 10,"Neonatal Fc-receptor (FcRn), the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I-like Fc-receptor, transports immunoglobuline G (IgG) across cell layers, extending IgG half-life in circulation and providing newborns with humoral immunity. IgG1 and IgG2 have similar half-lives, yet IgG2 displays lower foetal than maternal concentration at term, despite all known FcRn binding residues being preserved between IgG1 and IgG2. We investigated FcRn mediated transcytosis of VH-matched IgG1 and IgG2 and mutated variants thereof lacking Fc-gamma receptor (FcγR) binding in human cells expressing FcRn. We observed that FcγR binding was not required for transport and that FcRn transported less IgG2 than IgG1. Transport of IgG1 with a shortened lower hinge (ΔGly236, absent in germline IgG2), was reduced to levels equivalent to IgG2. Conversely, transport of IgG2 + Gly236 was increased to IgG1 levels. Gly236 is not a contact residue between IgG and FcRn, suggesting that its absence leads to an altered conformation of IgG, possibly due to a less flexible Fab, positioned closer to the Fc portion. This may sterically hinder FcRn binding and transport. We conclude that the lack of Gly236 is sufficient to explain the reduced FcRn-mediated IgG2 transcytosis and accounts for the low maternal/fetal IgG2 ratio at term.",Targeting mutations to the plastidial psbA gene of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii without direct positive selection.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089169,Scientific reports,2019 06 10,"Targeting mutations to specific genomic loci is invaluable for assessing in vivo the effect of these changes on the biological role of the gene in study.

For that, we established a strategy for targeted mutagenesis that was derived from the efficient genome-wide homologous-recombination-based methodology that was used to target individual genes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. While the isolated mutants did not show any benefit under elevated temperature conditions, the new strategy proved to be efficient for C. reinhardtii even in the absence of direct positive selection.",Previously unidentified Indonesian Throughflow pathways and freshening in the Indian Ocean during recent decades.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089167,Scientific reports,2019 06 10,"The Earth has experienced a global surface warming slowdown (GSWS) or so-called ""global warming hiatus"" since the end of the 20th century. The GSWS was marked by a La Niña-like decadal cooling in the Pacific Ocean that subsequently generated an increase in the transfer of Pacific waters into the Indian Ocean via the Indonesian Throughflow (ITF). How the Pacific water spreads through the interior of the Indian Ocean and the impact of these decadal ITF transport changes on the Indian Ocean water mass transformation and circulation remain largely unknown. Here, we analyze the thermohaline structures and current systems at different depths in the Indian Ocean prior to and during the GSWS period. Our study shows that the GSWS involved extensive changes to the Indo-Pacific ocean teleconnection system, characterized by subsurface warming and freshening in the Indian Ocean. A hitherto unknown Indian Ocean pathway of the ITF was discovered off Sumatra associated with prolonged northwestward flow within the South Java Current. Our analysis uncovers a direct linkage of enhanced ITF waters with the Agulhas Current in the Mozambique Channel from thermocline depths down to intermediate depths, that freshened the Indian Ocean. These changes in the Indian Ocean circulation and water mass characteristics impact climate variability through changing the sea surface temperature (SST) and precipitation patterns that can subsequently affect regional economies."

The IBS group displayed blunted sympathovagal balance [low/high-frequency ratio (LF:HF) of HRV] in response to colorectal distention compared with controls (P = 0.003). In controls, basal parasympathetic tone (HF component of HRV) was significantly negatively correlated with toleration threshold to the rectal distention, but not in patients with IBS (group comparison P = 0.04). Further, a positive correlation between baseline HF values and neural responses to rectal distension was found in the right caudate, bilateral dorsolateral anterior cingulate cortex, and pregenual anterior cingulate cortex in the control group but not in the IBS group. The results indicate abnormal interactions between ANS activity and the brain mechanisms underlying visceral perception in patients with IBS.",Contribution of frustules and mucilage trails to the mobility of diatom Navicula sp.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089153,Scientific reports,2019 06 10,"The secreted mucilage trails of the diatom Navicula sp. in the process of motility were studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and Raman spectra etc. Contrary to previous studies, force measurement was taken directly on the mucilage trails of live cells using the method of in situ force mapping by AFM. The retraction force curve presented an increased tip-substrate peak and a small saw-tooth pattern tip-mucilage peak. Especially, same measurements on various substrates with different surface energy revealed that the mucilage trails actually functioned as a medium increasing the adhesive force between the diatom and substrates, which is crucial to diatom's adhesion and locomotion. In addition, the mechanical properties of mucilage trails were quite different from mucilage strands in the maximum adhesive force and the maximum polymer extension length. Raman spectra indicated the difference in compositions that both of the two kinds of mucilages had proteins and polysaccharide, but the mucilage strands contained some other components with C=O, -CH2- and -CH3 asymmetric and symmetric stretches. This research hammers out more precise information about mucilage trails which would be useful in terms of diatom motility and biofouling prevention.","Multiple Lineages of Dengue Virus Serotype 2 Cosmopolitan Genotype Caused a Local Dengue Outbreak in Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, China, in 2017.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089152,Scientific reports,2019 06 10,"During July to November 2017, a large dengue outbreak involving 1,138 indigenous cases occurred in Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, China. All patients were clinically diagnosed as mild dengue. Epidemiology investigation and phylogenetic analysis of circulating viruses revealed that at least three lineages of dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV-2) Cosmopolitan genotype initiated the outbreak during a short time. The analysis of the time to most recent common ancestor estimated that the putative ancestor of these DENV-2 lineages might rise no later than March, 2017, suggesting independent introductions of these lineages into Hangzhou. We presumed that group travelers visiting dengue-endemic areas gave rise to multiple introductions of these lineages during so short a time. Co-circulating of multiple DENV-2 lineages, emerging of disease in urban areas, hot and humid weather in Hangzhou adequate for mosquito breeding, and limited dengue diagnosis abilities of local hospitals, were the reasons causing the large local outbreak in Hangzhou.","Fumigation and contact activities of 18 plant essential oils on Villosiclava virens, the pathogenic fungus of rice false smut.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089151,Scientific reports,2019 06 10,"Rice false smut (RFS), caused by Villosiclava virens, is an emerging devastating disease of rice panicles worldwide and produces yield loss and mycotoxin residues in rice. In this study, 18 plant essential oils (PEOs) were selected to evaluate antifungal activity via fumigation and contact methods against the mycelial growth and conidial germination of V. virens. The primary compositions of PEOs with stronger fungistatic activity were analyzed using gas chromatography (GC)-mass spectrometry (MS), and the changes in the mycelial morphology were observed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Antifungal tests showed that cinnamon bark oil and cinnamon oil had stronger fumigation and contact effects on V. virens than the other oils tested. The primary active composition in both cinnamon bark oil and cinnamon oil was trans-cinnamaldehyde, which exhibited contact activities with EC50 values of 2.13 and 35.9 μg/mL against mycelial growth and conidial germination, respectively. The hyphae surface morphological alterations caused by cinnamon bark oil, cinnamon oil and trans-cinnamaldehyde included shriveling, vacuolation and exfoliation. In conclusion, cinnamon bark oil and cinnamon oil have the potential to prevent and control RFS, and trans-cinnamaldehyde is a promising natural lead compound for new fungicide discoveries to control RFS contamination and mycotoxin residues in rice.",First in-situ observation of a moving natural pyroclastic density current using Doppler radar.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089150,Scientific reports,2019 06 10,"Pyroclastic density currents are one of the most devastating volcanic hazards. Understanding their dynamics is a key to develop successful hazard mitigation strategies. The hazard associated with pyroclastic density currents is commonly investigated a posteriori from their deposits or a priori using analogue and numerical experiments. Despite the low probability of observing a natural moving pyroclastic density current, we present the first in-situ analysis of the internal particle velocities of pyroclastic density currents at Volcán de Colima using a Doppler radar. Our data show two Vulcanian explosions, immediately followed by column collapse and a first pyroclastic density current travelling down the south flank with an average speed of 30 m/s (>50 m/s maximum speed) to a distance of 3 km from the crater rim. The direction of the pyroclastic density current coincided with that of the radar beam enabling measurement of velocity spectra (histogram of particle velocities within the radar beam). The measurement geometry enables the simultaneous measurement of the dense undercurrent at the crater rim (with <20 m/s and an increasing echo power over 20 s) and the dilute cloud higher above the topography approaching the radar (with >20 m/s and approximately constant echo power). The presented data set may be used as a benchmark for future experimental and numerical models that simulate the dynamics of pyroclastic density currents. Using the measured velocities of the collapsing column as input for numerical models will permit the validation of the models for the prediction of the true run-out distance, and thus provide valuable information for hazard assessments.",Retinal Defocus and Form-Deprivation Exposure Duration Affects RPE BMP Gene Expression.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089149,Scientific reports,2019 06 10,"In the context of ocular development and eye growth regulation, retinal defocus and/or image contrast appear key variables although the nature of the signal(s) relayed from the retina to the sclera remains poorly understood. Nonetheless, under optimal visual conditions, eye length is brought into alignment with its optical power to achieve approximate emmetropia, through appropriate adjustment to eye growth. The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), which lies between the retina and choroid/sclera, appears to play a crucial role in this process. In the investigations reported here, we used a chick model system to assess the threshold duration of exposure to lens-imposed defocus and form-deprivation necessary for conversion of evoked retinal signals into changes in BMP gene expression in the RPE. Our study provides evidence for the following: 1) close-loop, optical defocus-guided (negative and positive lenses) bidirectional BMP gene expression regulation, 2) open-loop, form-deprivation (diffusers)-induced down-regulation of BMP gene expression, and 3) early, transient up-regulation of BMP gene expression in response to both types of lens and diffuser applications. The critical exposure for accurately encoding retinal images as biological signals at the level of the RPE is in the order of minutes to hours, depending on the nature of the visual manipulations.",Comparative Analysis of Eleven Healthcare-Associated Outbreaks of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (Mers-Cov) from 2015 to 2017.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089148,Scientific reports,2019 06 10,"Since its emergence in 2012, 2,260 cases and 803 deaths due to Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) have been reported to the World Health Organization. Most cases were due to transmission in healthcare settings, sometimes causing large outbreaks. We analyzed epidemiologic and clinical data of laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV cases from eleven healthcare-associated outbreaks in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the Republic of Korea between 2015-2017. We quantified key epidemiological differences between outbreaks. Twenty-five percent (n = 105/422) of MERS cases who acquired infection in a hospital setting were healthcare personnel. In multivariate analyses, age ≥65 (OR 4.8, 95%CI: 2.6-8.7) and the presence of underlying comorbidities (OR: 2.7, 95% CI: 1.3-5.7) were associated with increased mortality whereas working as healthcare personnel was protective (OR 0.07, 95% CI: 0.01-0.34). At the start of these outbreaks, the reproduction number ranged from 1.0 to 5.7; it dropped below 1 within 2 to 6 weeks. This study provides a comprehensive characterization of MERS HCA-outbreaks. Our results highlight heterogeneities in the epidemiological profile of healthcare-associated outbreaks. The limitations of our study stress the urgent need for standardized data collection for high-threat respiratory pathogens, such as MERS-CoV.",Early maturing Bt cotton requires more potassium fertilizer under water deficiency to augment seed-cotton yield but not lint quality.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089147,Scientific reports,2019 06 10,"Exhaustive crops such as cotton require potassium (K) in copious amounts as compared to other crops. High yielding cultivars in cotton-wheat cropping system, have further increased its demand in cotton growing areas of Pakistan. As cotton is grown in arid and semiarid areas, therefore often prone to water deficiency. The reproductive growth particularly flowering and boll setting are highly sensitive to low soil water potentials, where enough K supply can play a vital role. In this two-year field studies, three cultivars (early, mid and late maturing) were cultivated at two K fertilizer levels 100, 200 kg K ha-1 along with control with no K fertilizer application at two irrigation levels. In first irrigation level, water was applied as per full irrigation schedule, while in water deficit irrigation water was applied at deficit irrigation schedule started after flowering till harvesting. It has been revealed that K application has impact on boll setting as well as seed cotton yield, however early and mid-maturing cultivars are more responsive to K fertilization. Furthermore, irrigation level had significant impact against K fertilization and relatively better response was observed in deficit irrigation as compared to full irrigation. Nevertheless, fiber quality parameters were unaffected by K fertilization. Considering the best benefit cost ratio under water deficiency, it is concluded that 100 kg K2O ha-1 should be applied at the time of seed bed preparation for economical seed-cotton yield of early maturing Bt cotton.",Dynamics of archaeal community in soil with application of composted tannery sludge.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089146,Scientific reports,2019 06 10,"Application of composted tannery sludge (CTS) could promote a shift in the structure of soil microbial communities. Although the effect of CTS on bacterial community has been studied, it is unclear how the composition and diversity of archaeal community respond to CTS amendment and which environmental factors drive the community over time. Here, we hypothesize that the Archaea structure and composition respond to CTS amendment over the time. CTS had been previously applied annually along 6 years and this assessment occurred for 180 days following the application in the 7th year by using different rates (0, 2.5, 5, 10 and 20 ton ha-1). We used amplicon 16S rRNA sequencing to assess the changes in the structure of the archaeal community. Thaumarchaeota and Euryarchaeota were the most abundant phyla found in soils with application of CTS, with Thaumarchaeota dominating the sequences in all samples with relative abundances of >98%. We observed a decreasing trend on the archaeal diversity over the time with increasing CTS application rate, together with an increase in the community similarity. The redundancy analyses (RDA) explained 43% of the total variation in operational taxonomic units and identified Na, pH, Cr and P as the main drivers of the archaeal community over time after application of highest CTS rates. CTS application changes the structure of Archaea community, with significant increase of Thaumarchaeota and Aenigmarchaeota groups, which can be further explored for its biotechnological use in contaminated soils."

Here, we report that JNK1/2 activities attenuate Lkb1-deficiency-driven LSCC initiation and progression through repressing ΔNp63 signaling. In vivo Lkb1 ablation alone is sufficient to induce LSCC development by reducing MKK7 levels and JNK1/2 activities, independent of the AMPKα and mTOR pathways. JNK1/2 activities is positively regulated by MKK7 during LSCC development. Pharmaceutically elevated JNK1/2 activities abates Lkb1 dependent LSCC formation while compound mutations of Jnk1/2 and Lkb1 further accelerate LSCC progression. JNK1/2 is inactivated in a substantial proportion of human LSCC and JNK1/2 activities positively correlates with survival rates of lung, cervical and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients. These findings not only determine a suppressive role of the stress response regulators JNK1/2 on LSCC development by acting downstream of the key LSCC suppresser Lkb1, but also demonstrate activating JNK1/2 activities as a therapeutic approach against LSCC.","IL-1β, IL-23, and TGF-β drive plasticity of human ILC2s towards IL-17-producing ILCs in nasal inflammation.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089134,Nature communications,2019 05 29,"Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) are crucial for the immune surveillance at mucosal sites. ILCs coordinate early eradication of pathogens and contribute to tissue healing and remodeling, features that are dysfunctional in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). The mechanisms by which ILCs contribute to CF-immunopathology are ill-defined. Here, we show that group 2 ILCs (ILC2s) transdifferentiated into IL-17-secreting cells in the presence of the epithelial-derived cytokines IL-1β, IL-23 and TGF-β. This conversion is abrogated by IL-4 or vitamin D3. IL-17 producing ILC2s induce IL-8 secretion by epithelial cells and their presence in nasal polyps of CF patients is associated with neutrophilia. Our data suggest that ILC2s undergo transdifferentiation in CF nasal polyps in response to local cytokines, which are induced by infectious agents.",Dissociating task acquisition from expression during learning reveals latent knowledge.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089133,Nature communications,2019 05 29,"Performance on cognitive tasks during learning is used to measure knowledge, yet it remains controversial since such testing is susceptible to contextual factors. To what extent does performance during learning depend on the testing context, rather than underlying knowledge? We trained mice, rats and ferrets on a range of tasks to examine how testing context impacts the acquisition of knowledge versus its expression. We interleaved reinforced trials with probe trials in which we omitted reinforcement. Across tasks, each animal species performed remarkably better in probe trials during learning and inter-animal variability was strikingly reduced. Reinforcement feedback is thus critical for learning-related behavioral improvements but, paradoxically masks the expression of underlying knowledge. We capture these results with a network model in which learning occurs during reinforced trials while context modulates only the read-out parameters. Probing learning by omitting reinforcement thus uncovers latent knowledge and identifies context- not ""smartness""- as the major source of individual variability.",Nucleoporin Nup155 is part of the p53 network in liver cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089132,Nature communications,2019 05 28,"Cancer-relevant signalling pathways rely on bidirectional nucleocytoplasmic transport events through the nuclear pore complex (NPC). However, mechanisms by which individual NPC components (Nups) participate in the regulation of these pathways remain poorly understood. We discover by integrating large scale proteomics, polysome fractionation and a focused RNAi approach that Nup155 controls mRNA translation of p21 (CDKN1A), a key mediator of the p53 response. The underlying mechanism involves transcriptional regulation of the putative tRNA and rRNA methyltransferase FTSJ1 by Nup155. Furthermore, we observe that Nup155 and FTSJ1 are p53 repression targets and accordingly find a correlation between the p53 status, Nup155 and FTSJ1 expression in murine and human hepatocellular carcinoma. Our data suggest an unanticipated regulatory network linking translational control by and repression of a structural NPC component modulating the p53 pathway through its effectors.",A strongly adhesive hemostatic hydrogel for the repair of arterial and heart bleeds.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089131,Nature communications,2019 05 28,"Uncontrollable bleeding is a major problem in surgical procedures and after major trauma. Existing hemostatic agents poorly control hemorrhaging from traumatic arterial and cardiac wounds because of their weak adhesion to wet and mobile tissues. Here we design a photo-reactive adhesive that mimics the extracellular matrix (ECM) composition. This biomacromolecule-based matrix hydrogel can undergo rapid gelling and fixation to adhere and seal bleeding arteries and cardiac walls after UV light irradiation. These repairs can withstand up to 290 mm Hg blood pressure, significantly higher than blood pressures in most clinical settings (systolic BP 60-160 mm Hg). Most importantly, the hydrogel can stop high-pressure bleeding from pig carotid arteries with 4~ 5 mm-long incision wounds and from pig hearts with 6 mm diameter cardiac penetration holes. Treated pigs survived after hemostatic treatments with this hydrogel, which is well-tolerated and appears to offer significant clinical advantage as a traumatic wound sealant.",Suppression of a broad spectrum of liver autoimmune pathologies by single peptide-MHC-based nanomedicines.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089130,Nature communications,2019 05 29,"Peptide-major histocompatibility complex class II (pMHCII)-based nanomedicines displaying tissue-specific autoantigenic epitopes can blunt specific autoimmune conditions by re-programming cognate antigen-experienced CD4+ T-cells into disease-suppressing T-regulatory type 1 (TR1) cells. Here, we show that single pMHCII-based nanomedicines displaying epitopes from mitochondrial, endoplasmic reticulum or cytoplasmic antigens associated with primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) or autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) can broadly blunt PBC, AIH and Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis in various murine models in an organ- rather than disease-specific manner, without suppressing general or local immunity against infection or metastatic tumors. Therapeutic activity is associated with cognate TR1 cell formation and expansion, TR1 cell recruitment to the liver and draining lymph nodes, local B-regulatory cell formation and profound suppression of the pro-inflammatory capacity of liver and liver-proximal myeloid dendritic cells and Kupffer cells. Thus, autoreactivity against liver-enriched autoantigens in liver autoimmunity is not disease-specific and can be harnessed to treat various liver autoimmune diseases broadly.",Extremely stretchable and self-healing conductor based on thermoplastic elastomer for all-three-dimensional printed triboelectric nanogenerator.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089129,Nature communications,2019 05 29,"Advances in next-generation soft electronic devices rely on the development of highly deformable, healable, and printable energy generators to power these electronics.

We address this issue by developing a highly conductive, extremely stretchable, and healable composite based on thermoplastic elastomer with liquid metal and silver flakes as the stretchable conductor for triboelectric nanogenerators. The elastomer is used both as the matrix for the conductor and as the triboelectric layer. The nanogenerator showed a stretchability of 2500% and it recovered its energy-harvesting performance after extreme mechanical damage, due to the supramolecular hydrogen bonding of the thermoplastic elastomer. The composite of the thermoplastic elastomer, liquid metal particles, and silver flakes exhibited an initial conductivity of 6250 S cm-1 and recovered 96.0% of its conductivity after healing.",Bacteroides fragilis polysaccharide A induces IL-10 secreting B and T cells that prevent viral encephalitis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089128,Nature communications,2019 05 29,"The gut commensal Bacteroides fragilis or its capsular polysaccharide A (PSA) can prevent various peripheral and CNS sterile inflammatory disorders.

Only PSA-treated mice survived, with dramatically reduced brainstem inflammation and altered cytokine and chemokine profiles. Importantly, PSA binding by B cells is essential for induction of regulatory CD4+ and CD8+ T cells secreting IL-10 to control innate inflammatory responses, consistent with the lack of PSA mediated protection in Rag-/-, B cell- and IL-10-deficient mice.

This study was conducted using swAPP695-HEK293 cells as an Alzheimer's disease cell model. swAPP695-HEK293 cells were treated with 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, and 10 μM curcumin for 24 hours. The changes in miR-15b-5p, miR-19a-3p, miR-195-5p, miR-101-3p, miR-216b-5p, miR-16-5p and miR-185-5p expression were assessed by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The mRNA and protein levels of amyloid precursor protein, amyloid-β40 and amyloid-β42 were evaluated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, western blot assays and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. swAPP695-HEK293 cells were transfected with miR-15b-5p mimic, or treated with 1 μM curcumin 24 hours before miR-15b-5p inhibitor transfection. The effects of curcumin on amyloid precursor protein, amyloid-β40 and amyloid-β42 levels were evaluated by western blot assays and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Luciferase assays were used to analyze the interaction between miR-15b-5p and the 3'-untranslated region of amyloid precursor protein. The results show that amyloid precursor protein and amyloid-β expression were enhanced in swAPP695-HEK293 cells compared with HEK293 parental cells. Curcumin suppressed the expression of amyloid precursor protein and amyloid-β and up-regulated the expression of miR-15b-5p in swAPP695-HEK293 cells. In addition, we found a negative association of miR-15b-5p expression with amyloid precursor protein and amyloid-β levels in the curcumin-treated cells. Luciferase assays revealed that miR-15b-5p impaired the luciferase activity of the plasmid harboring the 3'-untranslated region of amyloid precursor protein. These findings indicate that curcumin down-regulates the expression of amyloid precursor protein and amyloid-β in swAPP695-HEK293 cells, which was partially mediated by miR-15b-5p via targeting of the 3'-untranslated region of amyloid precursor protein.",Interleukin-4 affects microglial autophagic flux.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089059,Neural regeneration research,2019 06 14,"Interleukin-4 plays an important protective role in Alzheimer's disease by regulating microglial phenotype, phagocytosis of amyloid-β, and secretion of anti-inflammatory and neurotrophic cytokines. Recently, increasing evidence has suggested that autophagy regulates innate immunity by affecting M1/M2 polarization of microglia/macrophages. However, the role of interleukin-4 in microglial autophagy is unknown. In view of this, BV2 microglia were treated with 0, 10, 20 or 50 ng/mL interleukin-4 for 24, 48, or 72 hours. Subsequently, light chain 3-II and p62 protein expression levels were detected by western blot assay. BV2 microglia were incubated with interleukin-4 (20 ng/mL, experimental group), 3-methyladenine (500 μM, autophagy inhibitor, negative control group), rapamycin (100 nM, autophagy inductor, positive control group), 3-methyladenine + interleukin-4 (rescue group), or without treatment for 24 hours, and then exposed to amyloid-β (1 μM, model group) or vehicle control (control) for 24 hours. LC3-II and p62 protein expression levels were again detected by western blot assay. In addition, expression levels of multiple markers of M1 and M2 phenotype were assessed by real-time fluorescence quantitative polymerase chain reaction, while intracellular and supernatant amyloid-β protein levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Our results showed that interleukin-4 induced microglial autophagic flux, most significantly at 20 ng/mL for 48 hours. Interleukin-4 pretreated microglia inhibited blockade of amyloid-β-induced autophagic flux, and promoted amyloid-β uptake and degradation partly through autophagic flux, but inhibited switching of amyloid-β-induced M1 phenotype independent on autophagic flux. These results indicate that interleukin-4 pretreated microglia increases uptake and degradation of amyloid-β in a process partly mediated by autophagy, which may play a protective role against Alzheimer's disease.","Corrigendum: A high methionine, low folate and vitamin B 6 /B 12 containing diet can be associated with memory loss by epigenetic silencing of netrin-1.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089058,Neural regeneration research,2019 06 14,[This corrects the article DOI: 10.4103/1673-5374.251333].,RNA sequencing screening of differentially expressed genes after spinal cord injury.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089057,Neural regeneration research,2019 06 14,"In the search for a therapeutic schedule for spinal cord injury, it is necessary to understand key genes and their corresponding regulatory networks involved in the spinal cord injury process. However, ad hoc selection and analysis of one or two genes cannot fully reveal the complex molecular biological mechanisms of spinal cord injury. The emergence of second-generation sequencing technology (RNA sequencing) has provided a better method. In this study, RNA sequencing technology was used to analyze differentially expressed genes at different time points after spinal cord injury in rat models established by contusion of the eighth thoracic segment. The numbers of genes that changed significantly were 944, 1362 and 1421 at 1, 4 and 7 days after spinal cord injury respectively. After gene ontology analysis and temporal expression analysis of the differentially expressed genes, C5ar1, Socs3 and CCL6 genes were then selected and identified by real-time polymerase chain reaction and western blot assay. The mRNA expression trends of C5ar1, Socs3 and CCL6 genes were consistent with the RNA sequencing results. Further verification and analysis of C5ar1 indicate that the level of protein expression of C5ar1 was consistent with its nucleic acid level after spinal cord injury. C5ar1 was mainly expressed in neurons and astrocytes. Finally, the gene Itgb2, which may be related to C5ar1, was found by Chilibot database and literature search. Immunofluorescence histochemical results showed that the expression of Itgb2 was highly consistent with that of C5ar1. Itgb2 was expressed in astrocytes. RNA sequencing technology can screen differentially expressed genes at different time points after spinal cord injury. Through analysis and verification, genes strongly associated with spinal cord injury can be screened. This can provide experimental data for further determining the molecular mechanism of spinal cord injury, and also provide possible targets for the treatment of spinal cord injury.

Mitochondrial dysfunction is a major contributing factor in secondary brain injury resulting from traumatic brain injury. To investigate the protective effect of polydatin after traumatic brain injury, a rat brain injury model of lateral fluid percussion was established to mimic traumatic brain injury insults. Rat models were intraperitoneally injected with polydatin (30 mg/kg) or the SIRT1 activator SRT1720 (20 mg/kg, as a positive control to polydatin). At 6 hours post-traumatic brain injury insults, western blot assay was used to detect the expression of SIRT1, endoplasmic reticulum stress related proteins and p38 phosphorylation in cerebral cortex on the injured side. Flow cytometry was used to analyze neuronal mitochondrial superoxide, mitochondrial membrane potential and mitochondrial permeability transition pore opened. Ultrastructural damage in neuronal mitochondria was measured by transmission electron microscopy. Our results showed that after treatment with polydatin, release of reactive oxygen species in neuronal mitochondria was markedly reduced; swelling of mitochondria was alleviated; mitochondrial membrane potential was maintained; mitochondrial permeability transition pore opened. Also endoplasmic reticulum stress related proteins were inhibited, including the activation of p-PERK, spliced XBP-1 and cleaved ATF6. SIRT1 expression and activity were increased; p38 phosphorylation and cleaved caspase-9/3 activation were inhibited. Neurological scores of treated rats were increased and the mortality was reduced compared with the rats only subjected to traumatic brain injury. These results indicated that polydatin protectrd rats from the consequences of traumatic brain injury and exerted a protective effect on neuronal mitochondria. The mechanisms may be linked to increased SIRT1 expression and activity, which inhibits the p38 phosphorylation-mediated mitochondrial apoptotic pathway.

To investigate the relationship between the cingulum injury and cognitive impairment in patients with chronic mild traumatic brain injury, we evaluated the integrity between the anterior cingulum and the basal forebrain using diffusion tensor tractography in 73 patients with chronic mild traumatic brain injury (39 males, 34 females, age 43.29 ± 11.42 years) and 40 healthy controls (22 males, 18 females, age 40.11 ± 16.81 years). The patients were divided into three subgroups based on the integrity between the anterior cingulum and the basal forebrain on diffusion tensor tractography: subgroup A (n = 19 patients) - both sides of the anterior cingulum were intact; subgroup B (n = 36 patients) - either side of the anterior cingulum was intact; and subgroup C (18 patients) - both sides of the anterior cingulum were discontinued. There were significant differences in total Memory Assessment Scale score between subgroups A and B and between subgroups A and C. There were no significant differences in diffusion tensor tractography parameters (fractional anisotropy, apparent diffusion coefficient, and fiber volume) between patients and controls. These findings suggest that the integrity between the anterior cingulum and the basal forebrain, but not diffusion tensor tractography parameter, can be used to predict the cognitive function of patients with chronic mild traumatic brain injury.

Most of these studies showed decreases in general functional connectivity, but they also found increases in some particular regions and areas. Frequently, these studies compared young individuals with older subjects, but few studies compared different age groups only in older populations. The purpose of this study is to analyze whole-brain functional connectivity in healthy older adult groups and its network characteristics through functional segregation. A total of 114 individuals, 48 to 89 years old, were scanned using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging in a resting state paradigm and were divided into six different age groups (< 60, 60-64, 65-69, 70-74, 75-79, ≥ 80 years old). A partial correlation analysis, a pooled correlation analysis and a study of 3-cycle regions with prominent connectivity were conducted. Our results showed progressive diminution in the functional connectivity among different age groups and this was particularly pronounced between 75 and 79 years old. The oldest group (≥ 80 years old) showed a slight increase in functional connectivity compared to the other groups. This occurred possibly because of compensatory mechanism in brain functioning. This study provides information on the brain functional characteristics of every age group, with more specific information on the functional progressive decline, and supplies methodological tools to study functional connectivity characteristics.

However, neuroprotective mechanisms of OJE have not been fully identified. Thus, this study investigated the neuroprotection of OJE in the hippocampal CA1 area and its anti-inflammatory activity in gerbils subjected to 5 minutes of transient global cerebral ischemia. We treated the animals by intragastrical injection of OJE (100 and 200 mg/kg) once daily for 1 week prior to transient global cerebral ischemia. Neuroprotection of OJE was observed by immunohistochemistry for neuronal nuclear antigen and histofluorescence staining for Fluoro-Jade B. Immunohistochemistry of glial fibrillary acidic protein and ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 was done for astrocytosis and microgliosis, respectively. To investigate the neuroprotective mechanisms of OJE, we performed immunohistochemistry of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-2 for pro-inflammatory function and interleukin-4 and interleukin-13 for anti-inflammatory function. When we treated the animals by intragastrical administration of 200 mg/kg of OJE, hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons were protected from transient global cerebral ischemia and cerebral ischemia-induced gliosis was inhibited in the ischemic hippocampal CA1 area. We also found that interleukin-4 and -13 immunoreactivities were significantly increased in pyramidal neurons of the ischemic CA1 area after OJE pretreatment, and the increased immunoreactivities were sustained in the CA1 pyramidal neurons after transient global cerebral ischemia. However, OJE pretreatment did not increase interleukin-2 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha immunoreactivities in the CA1 pyramidal neurons. Our findings suggest that pretreatment with OJE can protect neurons and attenuate gliosis from transient global cerebral ischemia via increasing expressions of interleukin-4 and -13.

To investigate the effects of sodium butyrate on hippocampal dysfunction that occurs after whole-brain irradiation in animal models and the effect of sodium butyrate on radiation exposure-induced cognitive impairments, adult C57BL/6 mice were intraperitoneally treated with 0.6 g/kg sodium butyrate before exposure to 10 Gy cranial irradiation. Cognitive impairment in adult C57BL/6 mice was evaluated via an object recognition test 30 days after irradiation. We also detected the expression levels of neurogenic cell markers (doublecortin) and phosphorylated cAMP response element binding protein/brain-derived neurotrophic factor. Radiation-exposed mice had decreased cognitive function and hippocampal doublecortin and phosphorylated cAMP response element binding protein/brain-derived neurotrophic factor expression. Sodium butyrate pretreatment reversed these changes. These findings suggest that sodium butyrate can improve radiation-induced cognitive dysfunction through inhibiting the decrease in hippocampal phosphorylated cAMP response element binding protein/brain-derived neurotrophic factor expression.

Interestingly, among the neurotropic herpesviruses, herpes simplex virus-1, human herpesvirus-6A, and human herpesvirus-6B have been reported to infect several cell types present in the central nervous system and to dysregulate autophagy, a process required for homeostasis of cells, especially neurons. Indeed autophagosome accumulation, indicating an unbalance between autophagosome formation and autophagosome degradation, has been observed in neurons of Alzheimer's disease patients and may play a role in the intracellular and extracellular accumulation of amyloid β and in the altered protein tau metabolism. Moreover, herpesvirus infection of central nervous system cells such as glia and microglia can increase the production of oxidant species through the alteration of mitochondrial dynamics and promote inflammation, another hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. This evidence suggests that it is worth further investigating the role of neurotropic herpesviruses, particularly human herpesvirus-6A/B, in the etiopathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease."

Asymmetrically enriched histone H3K9 methylation in the maternal pronucleus was suggested to protect the underlying DNA from 5mC conversion. We hypothesized that an H3K9 methyltransferase enzyme, either EHMT2 or SETDB1, must be expressed in the oocyte to specify the asymmetry of 5mC oxidation. To test these possibilities, we genetically deleted the catalytic domain of either EHMT2 or SETDB1 in growing oocytes and achieved significant reduction of global H3K9me2 or H3K9me3 levels, respectively, in the maternal pronucleus. We found that the asymmetry of global 5mC oxidation was significantly reduced in the zygotes that carried maternal mutation of either the Ehmt2 or Setdb1 genes. Whereas the levels of 5hmC, 5fC, and 5caC increased, 5mC levels decreased in the mutant maternal pronuclei. H3K9me3-rich rings around the nucleolar-like bodies retained 5mC in the maternal mutant zygotes, suggesting that the pericentromeric heterochromatin regions are protected from DNA demethylation independently of EHMT2 and SETDB1. We observed that the maternal pronuclei expanded in size in the mutant zygotes and contained a significantly increased number of nucleolar-like bodies compared with normal zygotes.

We report on the 2.1-Å crystal structure of the hatchet ribozyme product, which adopts a compact pseudosymmetric dimeric scaffold, with each monomer stabilized by long-range interactions involving highly conserved nucleotides brought into close proximity of the scissile phosphate. Strikingly, the catalytic pocket contains a cavity capable of accommodating both the modeled scissile phosphate and its flanking 5' nucleoside. The resulting modeled precatalytic conformation incorporates a splayed-apart alignment at the scissile phosphate, thereby providing structure-based insights into the in-line cleavage mechanism. We identify a guanine lining the catalytic pocket positioned to contribute to cleavage chemistry. The functional relevance of structure-based insights into hatchet ribozyme catalysis is strongly supported by cleavage assays monitoring the impact of selected nucleobase and atom-specific mutations on ribozyme activity.","Solving the structure of Lgl2, a difficult blind test of unsupervised structure determination.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31088964,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2019 05 29,"In the companion paper by Ufimtsev and Levitt [Ufimtsev IS, Levitt M (2019) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 10.1073/pnas.1821512116], we presented a method for unsupervised solution of protein crystal structures and demonstrated its utility by solving several test cases of known structure in the 2.9- to 3.45-Å resolution range.

However, designing cell-penetrating long peptidomimetic scaffolds equipped with various functional groups necessary for interacting with large protein-binding interfaces remains challenging. This is particularly true for targeting β-catenin/BCL9 PPIs. Here we designed a series of unprecedented helical sulfono-γ-AApeptides that mimic the binding mode of the α-helical HD2 domain of B Cell Lymphoma 9 (BCL9). Our studies show that sulfono-γ-AApeptides can structurally and functionally mimic the α-helical domain of BCL9 and selectively disrupt β-catenin/BCL9 PPIs with even higher potency. More intriguingly, these sulfono-γ-AApeptides can enter cancer cells, bind with β-catenin and disrupt β-catenin/BCL9 PPIs, and exhibit excellent cellular activity, which is much more potent than the BCL9 peptide. Furthermore, our enzymatic stability studies demonstrate the remarkable stability of the helical sulfono-γ-AApeptides, with no degradation in the presence of pronase for 24 h, augmenting their biological potential. This work represents not only an example of helical sulfono-γ-AApeptides that mimic α-helix and disrupt protein-protein interactions, but also an excellent example of potent, selective, and cell-permeable unnatural foldameric peptidomimetics that disrupt the β-catenin/BCL9 PPI.

H. pylori strains carrying the cag pathogenicity island (cagPAI) are associated with increased risk of disease progression. The cagPAI encodes the Cag type IV secretion system (CagT4SS), which delivers the CagA oncoprotein and other effector molecules into human gastric epithelial cells. We visualized structures of native and mutant CagT4SS machines on the H. pylori cell envelope by cryoelectron tomography. Individual H. pylori cells contain multiple CagT4SS nanomachines, each composed of a wheel-shaped outer membrane complex (OMC) with 14-fold symmetry and an inner membrane complex (IMC) with 6-fold symmetry. CagX, CagY, and CagM are required for assembly of the OMC, whereas strains lacking Cag3 and CagT produce outer membrane complexes lacking peripheral components. The IMC, which has never been visualized in detail, is configured as six tiers in cross-section view and three concentric rings surrounding a central channel in end-on view. The IMC contains three T4SS ATPases: (i) VirB4-like CagE, arranged as a hexamer of dimers at the channel entrance; (ii) a hexamer of VirB11-like Cagα, docked at the base of the CagE hexamer; and (iii) VirD4-like Cagβ and other unspecified Cag subunits, associated with the stacked CagE/Cagα complex and forming the outermost rings.

As the top hit in the translation pathway, ABCE1, a member of the ATP-binding cassette transporters, was chosen for further study. We found that ABCE1 supports replication of all three viruses, confirming its importance for viruses of both families. More detailed characterization revealed that ABCE1 is specifically required for efficient viral but not general cellular protein synthesis, indicating that paramyxoviral and pneumoviral mRNAs exploit specific translation mechanisms. In addition to providing a novel overview of cellular proteins and pathways that impact these important pathogens, this study highlights the role of ABCE1 as a host factor required for efficient paramyxovirus and pneumovirus translation.IMPORTANCE The Paramyxoviridae and Pneumoviridae families include important human and animal pathogens. To identify common host factors, we performed genome-scale siRNA screens with wild-type-derived measles, mumps, and respiratory syncytial viruses in the same cell line. A comparative bioinformatics analysis yielded different members of the coatomer complex I, translation factors ABCE1 and eIF3A, and several RNA binding proteins as cellular proteins with proviral activity for all three viruses. A more detailed characterization of ABCE1 revealed its essential role for viral protein synthesis. Taken together, these data sets provide new insight into the interactions between paramyxoviruses and pneumoviruses and host cell proteins and constitute a starting point for the development of broadly effective antivirals.","Comparative Genomics of Cyanobacterial Symbionts Reveals Distinct, Specialized Metabolism in Tropical Dysideidae Sponges.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31088928,mBio,2019 05 18,"Marine sponges are recognized as valuable sources of bioactive metabolites and renowned as petri dishes of the sea, providing specialized niches for many symbiotic microorganisms. Sponges of the family Dysideidae are well documented to be chemically talented, often containing high levels of polyhalogenated compounds, terpenoids, peptides, and other classes of bioactive small molecules. This group of tropical sponges hosts a high abundance of an uncultured filamentous cyanobacterium, Hormoscilla spongeliae Here, we report the comparative genomic analyses of two phylogenetically distinct Hormoscilla populations, which reveal shared deficiencies in essential pathways, hinting at possible reasons for their uncultivable status, as well as differing biosynthetic machinery for the production of specialized metabolites. One symbiont population contains clustered genes for expanded polybrominated diphenylether (PBDE) biosynthesis, while the other instead harbors a unique gene cluster for the biosynthesis of the dysinosin nonribosomal peptides. The hybrid sequencing and assembly approach utilized here allows, for the first time, a comprehensive look into the genomes of these elusive sponge symbionts.IMPORTANCE Natural products provide the inspiration for most clinical drugs. With the rise in antibiotic resistance, it is imperative to discover new sources of chemical diversity. Bacteria living in symbiosis with marine invertebrates have emerged as an untapped source of natural chemistry. While symbiotic bacteria are often recalcitrant to growth in the lab, advances in metagenomic sequencing and assembly now make it possible to access their genetic blueprint.

In contrast, Bordetella pertussis, the causative agent of whooping cough, has historically been described as a nonmotile and nonflagellated organism. The previous statements that B. pertussis was a nonmotile organism were consistent with a stop codon located in the flagellar biosynthesis gene, flhA, discovered when the B. pertussis Tohama I genome was sequenced and analyzed by Parkhill et al. in 2003 (J. Parkhill, M. Sebaihia, A. Preston, L. D. Murphy, et al., Nat Genet, 35:32-40, 2003, https://doi.org/10.1038/ng1227). The stop codon has subsequently been found in all annotated genomes. Parkhill et al. also showed, however, that B. pertussis contains all genetic material required for flagellar synthesis and function. We and others have determined by various transcriptomic analyses that these flagellar genes are differentially regulated under a variety of B. pertussis growth conditions. In light of these data, we tested for B. pertussis motility and found that both laboratory-adapted strains and clinical isolates can be motile. Upon isolation of motile B. pertussis, we discovered flagellum-like structures on the surface of the bacteria. B. pertussis motility appears to occur primarily in the Bvg(-) phase, consistent with regulation present in B. bronchiseptica Motility can also be induced by the presence of fetal bovine serum. These observations demonstrate that B. pertussis can express flagellum-like structures, and although it remains to be determined if B. pertussis expresses flagella during infection or if motility and/or flagella play roles during the cycle of infection and transmission, it is clear that these data warrant further investigation.IMPORTANCE This report provides evidence for motility and expression of flagella by B. pertussis, a bacterium that has been reported as nonmotile since it was first isolated and studied. As with B. bronchiseptica, B. pertussis cells can express and assemble a flagellum-like structure on their surface, which in other organisms has been implicated in several important processes that occur in vivo The discovery that B. pertussis is motile raises many questions, including those regarding the mechanisms of regulation for flagellar gene and protein expression and, importantly, the role of flagella during infection. This novel observation provides a foundation for further study of Bordetella flagella and motility in the contexts of infection and transmission.","Differential Effects of Influenza Virus NA, HA Head, and HA Stalk Antibodies on Peripheral Blood Leukocyte Gene Expression during Human Infection.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31088926,mBio,2019 05 17,"In this study, we examined the relationships between anti-influenza virus serum antibody titers, clinical disease, and peripheral blood leukocyte (PBL) global gene expression during presymptomatic, acute, and convalescent illness in 83 participants infected with 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus in a human influenza challenge model. Using traditional statistical and logistic regression modeling approaches, profiles of differentially expressed genes that correlated with active viral shedding, predicted length of viral shedding, and predicted illness severity were identified. These analyses further demonstrated that challenge participants fell into three peripheral blood leukocyte gene expression phenotypes that significantly correlated with different clinical outcomes and prechallenge serum titers of antibodies specific for the viral neuraminidase, hemagglutinin head, and hemagglutinin stalk. Higher prechallenge serum antibody titers were inversely correlated with leukocyte responsiveness in participants with active disease and could mask expression of peripheral blood markers of clinical disease in some participants, including viral shedding and symptom severity. Consequently, preexisting anti-influenza antibodies may modulate PBL gene expression, and this must be taken into consideration in the development and interpretation of peripheral blood diagnostic and prognostic assays of influenza infection.IMPORTANCE Influenza A viruses are significant human pathogens that caused 83,000 deaths in the United States during 2017 to 2018, and there is need to understand the molecular correlates of illness and to identify prognostic markers of viral infection, symptom severity, and disease course. Preexisting antibodies against viral neuraminidase (NA) and hemagglutinin (HA) proteins play a critical role in lessening disease severity. We performed global gene expression profiling of peripheral blood leukocytes collected during acute and convalescent phases from a large cohort of people infected with A/H1N1pdm virus. Using statistical and machine-learning approaches, populations of genes were identified early in infection that correlated with active viral shedding, predicted length of shedding, or disease severity. Finally, these gene expression responses were differentially affected by increased levels of preexisting influenza antibodies, which could mask detection of these markers of contagiousness and disease severity in people with active clinical disease.",Early Steps in Herpes Simplex Virus Infection Blocked by a Proteasome Inhibitor.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31088925,mBio,2019 05 18,"Viruses commandeer host cell 26S proteasome activity to promote viral entry, gene expression, replication, assembly, and egress. Proteasomal degradation activity is critical for herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection. The proteasome inhibitor bortezomib (also known as Velcade and PS-341) is a clinically effective antineoplastic drug that is FDA approved for treatment of hematologic malignancies such as multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma. Low nanomolar concentrations of bortezomib inhibited infection by HSV-1, HSV-2, and acyclovir-resistant strains. Inhibition coincided with minimal cytotoxicity. Bortezomib did not affect attachment of HSV to cells or inactivate the virus directly. Bortezomib acted early in HSV infection by perturbing two distinct proteasome-dependent steps that occur within the initial hours of infection: the transport of incoming viral nucleocapsids to the nucleus and the virus-induced disruption of host nuclear domain 10 (ND10) structures. The combination of bortezomib with acyclovir demonstrated synergistic inhibitory effects on HSV infection. Thus, bortezomib is a novel potential therapeutic for HSV with a defined mechanism of action.IMPORTANCE Viruses usurp host cell functions to advance their replicative agenda. HSV relies on cellular proteasome activity for successful infection. Proteasome inhibitors, such as MG132, block HSV infection at multiple stages of the infectious cycle. Targeting host cell processes for antiviral intervention is an unconventional approach that might limit antiviral resistance. Here we demonstrated that the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib, which is a clinically effective cancer drug, has the in vitro features of a promising anti-HSV therapeutic. Bortezomib inhibited HSV infection during the first hours of infection at nanomolar concentrations that were minimally cytotoxic. The mechanism of bortezomib's inhibition of early HSV infection was to halt nucleocapsid transport to the nucleus and to stabilize the ND10 cellular defense complex. Bortezomib and acyclovir acted synergistically to inhibit HSV infection. Overall, we present evidence for the repurposing of bortezomib as a novel antiherpesviral agent and describe specific mechanisms of action.",A Novel Cadherin-like Protein Mediates Adherence to and Killing of Host Cells by the Parasite Trichomonas vaginalis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31088924,mBio,2019 05 18,"Trichomonas vaginalis, a prevalent sexually transmitted parasite, adheres to and induces cytolysis of human mucosal epithelial cells. We have characterized a hypothetical protein, TVAG_393390, with predicted tertiary structure similar to that of mammalian cadherin proteins involved in cell-cell adherence. TVAG_393390, renamed cadherin-like protein (CLP), contains a calcium-binding site at a position conserved in cadherins. CLP is surface localized, and its mRNA and protein levels are significantly upregulated upon parasite adherence to host cells. To test the roles of CLP and its calcium-binding dependency during host cell adherence, we first demonstrated that wild-type CLP (CLP) binds calcium with a high affinity, whereas the calcium-binding site mutant protein (CLP-mut) does not. CLP and CLP-mut constructs were then used to overexpress these proteins in T. vaginalis Parasites overexpressing CLP have ∼3.5-fold greater adherence to host cells than wild-type parasites, and this increased adherence is ablated by mutating the calcium-binding site. Additionally, competition with recombinant CLP decreased parasite binding to host cells. We also found that overexpression of CLP induced parasite aggregation which was further enhanced in the presence of calcium, whereas CLP-mut overexpression did not affect aggregation. Lastly, parasites overexpressing wild-type CLP induced killing of host cells ∼2.35-fold, whereas parasites overexpressing CLP-mut did not have this effect. These analyses describe the first parasitic CLP and demonstrate a role for this protein in mediating parasite-parasite and host-parasite interactions. T. vaginalis CLP may represent convergent evolution of a parasite protein that is functionally similar to the mammalian cell adhesion protein cadherin, which contributes to parasite pathogenesis.IMPORTANCE The adherence of pathogens to host cells is critical for colonization of the host and establishing infection. Here we identify a protein with no known function that is more abundant on the surface of parasites that are better at binding host cells. To interrogate a predicted function of this protein, we utilized bioinformatic protein prediction programs which allowed us to uncover the first cadherin-like protein (CLP) found in a parasite. Cadherin proteins are conserved metazoan proteins with central roles in cell-cell adhesion, development, and tissue structure maintenance. Functional characterization of this CLP from the unicellular parasite Trichomonas vaginalis demonstrated that the protein mediates both parasite-parasite and parasite-host adherence, which leads to an enhanced killing of host cells by T. vaginalis Our findings demonstrate the presence of CLPs in unicellular pathogens and identify a new host cell binding protein family in a human-infective parasite.",Exposure of the Host-Associated Microbiome to Nutrient-Rich Conditions May Lead to Dysbiosis and Disease Development-an Evolutionary Perspective.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31088923,mBio,2019 05 17,"Inflammatory diseases, such as inflammatory bowel diseases, are dramatically increasing worldwide, but an understanding of the underlying factors is lacking. We here present an ecoevolutionary perspective on the emergence of inflammatory diseases. We propose that adaptation has led to fine-tuned host-microbe interactions, which are maintained by secreted host metabolites nourishing the associated microbes. A constant elevation of nutrients in the gut environment leads to an increased activity and changed functionality of the microbiota, thus severely disturbing host-microbe interactions and leading to dysbiosis and disease development. In the past, starvation and pathogen infections, causing diarrhea, were common incidences that reset the gut bacterial community to its ""human-specific-baseline."" However, these natural clearing mechanisms have been virtually eradicated in developed countries, allowing a constant uncontrolled growth of bacteria. This leads to an increase of bacterial products that stimulate the immune system and ultimately might initiate inflammatory reactions.",Symbiont-Mediated Defense against Legionella pneumophila in Amoebae.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31088922,mBio,2019 05 17,"Legionella pneumophila is an important opportunistic pathogen for which environmental reservoirs are crucial for the infection of humans. In the environment, free-living amoebae represent key hosts providing nutrients and shelter for highly efficient intracellular proliferation of L. pneumophila, which eventually leads to lysis of the protist. However, the significance of other bacterial players for L. pneumophila ecology is poorly understood. In this study, we used a ubiquitous amoeba and bacterial endosymbiont to investigate the impact of this common association on L. pneumophila infection. We demonstrate that L. pneumophila proliferation was severely suppressed in Acanthamoeba castellanii harboring the chlamydial symbiont Protochlamydia amoebophila The amoebae survived the infection and were able to resume growth. Different environmental amoeba isolates containing the symbiont were equally well protected as different L. pneumophila isolates were diminished, suggesting ecological relevance of this symbiont-mediated defense. Furthermore, protection was not mediated by impaired L. pneumophila uptake. Instead, we observed reduced virulence of L. pneumophila released from symbiont-containing amoebae. Pronounced gene expression changes in the presence of the symbiont indicate that interference with the transition to the transmissive phase impedes the L. pneumophila infection. Finally, our data show that the defensive response of amoebae harboring P. amoebophila leaves the amoebae with superior fitness reminiscent of immunological memory. Given that mutualistic associations between bacteria and amoebae are widely distributed, P. amoebophila and potentially other amoeba endosymbionts could be key in shaping environmental survival, abundance, and virulence of this important pathogen, thereby affecting the frequency of human infection.IMPORTANCE Bacterial pathogens are generally investigated in the context of disease. To prevent outbreaks, it is essential to understand their lifestyle and interactions with other microbes in their natural environment. Legionella pneumophila is an important human respiratory pathogen that survives and multiplies in biofilms or intracellularly within protists, such as amoebae. Importantly, transmission to humans occurs from these environmental sources. Legionella infection generally leads to rapid host cell lysis. It was therefore surprising to observe that amoebae, including fresh environmental isolates, were well protected during Legionella infection when the bacterial symbiont Protochlamydia amoebophila was also present. Legionella was not prevented from invading amoebae but was impeded in its ability to develop fully virulent progeny and were ultimately cleared in the presence of the symbiont. This study highlights how ecology and virulence of an important human pathogen is affected by a defensive amoeba symbiont, with possibly major consequences for public health."

Though mutations in KRAS are frequent in lung adenocarcinoma, there are currently no targeted agents against KRAS. Using a mouse lung adenocarcinoma cell line with a KRAS mutation (CMT167) we previously showed that PPARγ activation in lung cancer cells inhibits cell growth in vitro yet promotes tumor progression when activated in myeloid cells of the tumor microenvironment. Here we report PPAR activation in myeloid cells promotes the production of TGF-β1, which in turn acts on CMT167 cancer cells to increase migration and induce an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Targeting TGF-β1 signaling in CMT167 cells prevented their growth and metastasis in vivo. Similarly, another mouse lung adenocarcinoma cell line with a KRAS mutation, LLC, induced TGF-β1 in myeloid cells through PPARγ activation. However, LLC cells are more mesenchymal and did not undergo EMT in response to TGF-β1; nor did LLC require TGFβ1 signaling for metastasis in vivo. Converting CMT167 cells to a mesenchymal phenotype through overexpression of ZEB1 made them unresponsive to TGFβ1 receptor inhibition. The ability of TGF-β1 to induce EMT in lung tumors may represent a critical process in cancer progression. We propose that TGFβ receptor inhibition could provide an additional treatment option for KRAS mutant epithelial lung tumors. Implications: This study suggests that TGFβ receptor inhibitors may be an effective therapy in a subset of KRAS mutant NSCLC patients which show an epithelial phenotype.","HIF inactivation of p53 in Ovarian Cancer Can be Reversed by Topotecan, Restoring Cisplatin and Paclitaxel Sensitivity.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31088908,Molecular cancer research : MCR,2019 05 15,"Ovarian cancer (OC) growth under hypoxic conditions results in hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) stabilization. HIF-1α is an adverse prognostic factor that may contribute to worse outcomes via its capacity to bind to p53, potentially blocking p53-mediated apoptosis. We determined whether HIF-1α-p53 binding occurred in hypoxic OC cell lines, and if this blocked p53 transcriptional activity. Topotecan [TPT], used in the treatment of OC, inhibits HIF-1α translation via a topoisomerase-1 (TOPO1)-dependent mechanism. We examined if TPT knockdown of HIF-1α restored p53 transcriptional function. TPT effects on HIF-1α and p53-related transcriptional targets were assessed by PCR. Associations between TPT effects and TOPO1 expression levels were examined by western blots and knock-down by siRNA. RNA-binding protein immunoprecipitation (RIP) was used to assess if TOPO1 was resident on HIF1α mRNA. We determined if sub-lethal doses of TPT, used to knockdown HIF-1α, reversed hypoxia-related cisplatin and paclitaxel resistance (XTT assay). Flow cytometry was used to assess HIF-1α-mediated upregulation of ABCB1 and ABCB5 efflux pump expression. We found that HIF-1α binding to, and inhibition of, p53 transcriptional activity in hypoxic OC cells was associated with drug resistance. TPT-mediated down-regulation of HIF-1α in hypoxic cells required TOPO1 resident on HIF-1α mRNA, restored p53 transcriptional activity, down-regulated ABCB1/ABCB5 cell surface expression, and reversed hypoxia-related cisplatin and paclitaxel resistance. Implications: TPT-mediated reduction of HIF-1α accumulation in hypoxic OC cell lines restores p53 tumor suppressor function, offering a novel approach to reverse chemoresistance. Further clinical investigation is warranted.",The codon 72 TP53 polymorphism contributes to TSC-tumorigenesis through the Notch-Nodal axis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31088907,Molecular cancer research : MCR,2019 06 10,"We discovered that 90.3% of patients with angiomyolipomas, LAM, and tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) carry the arginine variant of codon 72 (R72) of TP53 and that R72 increases the risk for angiomyolipoma. R72 transactivates NOTCH1 and NODAL better than the proline variant of codon 72 (P72), therefore, the expression of NOTCH1 and NODAL is increased in angiomyolipoma cells that carry R72. The loss of Tp53 and Tsc1 within nestin expressing cells in mice resulted in development of RCC with high Notch1 and Nodal expression suggesting that similar downstream mechanisms contribute to tumorigenesis as a result of p53 loss in mice and p53 polymorphism in humans. The loss of murine Tp53 or expression of human R72 contribute to tumorigenesis via enhancing epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and motility of tumor cells through the Notch and Nodal pathways. Implications: This work revealed unexpected contributions of the p53 polymorphism to the pathogenesis of TSC and established signaling alterations caused by this polymorphism as a target for therapy. We found that the codon 72 TP53 polymorphism contributes to TSC-associated tumorigenesis via Notch and Nodal signaling.",Genomic Selection for Yield and Seed Composition Traits Within an Applied Soybean Breeding Program.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31088906,"G3 (Bethesda, Md.)",2019 05 15,"Genomic selection (GS) has become viable for selection of quantitative traits for which marker-assisted selection has often proven less effective. The potential of GS for soybean was characterized using 483 elite breeding lines, genotyped with BARCSoySNP6K iSelect BeadChips. Cross validation was performed using RR-BLUP and predictive abilities (rMP) of 0.81, 0.71, and 0.26 for protein, oil, and yield, were achieved at the largest tested training set size. Minimal differences were observed when comparing different marker densities and there appeared to be inflation in rMP due to population structure. For comparison purposes, two additional methods to predict breeding values for lines of four bi-parental populations within the GS dataset were tested. The first method predicted within each bi-parental population (WP method) and utilized a training set of full-sibs of the validation set. The second method utilized a training set of all remaining breeding lines except for full-sibs of the validation set to predict across populations (AP method). The AP method is more practical as the WP method would likely delay the breeding cycle and leverage smaller training sets. Averaging across populations for protein and oil content, rMP for the AP method (0.55, 0.30) approached rMP for the WP method (0.60, 0.52). Though comparable, rMP for yield was low for both AP and WP methods (0.12, 0.13). Based on increases in rMP as training sets increased and the effectiveness of WP versus AP method, the AP method could potentially improve with larger training sets and increased relatedness between training and validation sets.",ARMOR: An Automated Reproducible MOdular Workflow for Preprocessing and Differential Analysis of RNA-seq Data.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31088905,"G3 (Bethesda, Md.)",2019 05 15,"The extensive generation of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data in the last decade has resulted in a myriad of specialized software for its analysis. Each software module typically targets a specific step within the analysis pipeline, making it necessary to join several of them to get a single cohesive workflow.

We present ARMOR, which performs an end-to-end RNA-seq data analysis, from raw read files, via quality checks, alignment and quantification, to differential expression testing, geneset analysis and browser-based exploration of the data. ARMOR is implemented using the Snakemake workflow management system and leverages conda environments; Bioconductor objects are generated to facilitate downstream analysis, ensuring seamless integration with many R packages. The workflow is easily implemented by cloning the GitHub repository, replacing the supplied input and reference files and editing a configuration file.

The effectiveness of such induced cellular reprogramming is generally greatly reduced if the cellular substrates are fully differentiated cells. For example, in the nematode C. elegans, the ectopic expression of a neuronal identity-inducing transcription factor, CHE-1, can effectively induce CHE-1 target genes in immature cells but not in fully mature non-neuronal cells. To understand the molecular basis of this progressive restriction of cellular plasticity, we screened for C. elegans mutants in which ectopically expressed CHE-1 is able to induce neuronal effector genes in epidermal cells. We identified a ubiquitin hydrolase, usp-48, that restricts cellular plasticity with a notable cellular specificity. Even though we find usp-48 to be very broadly expressed in all tissue types, usp-48 null mutants specifically make epidermal cells susceptible to CHE-1-mediated activation of neuronal target genes. We screened for additional genes that allow epidermal cells to be at least partially reprogrammed by ectopic che-1 expression and identified many additional proteins that restrict cellular plasticity of epidermal cells, including a chromatin-related factor (H3K79 methyltransferase, DOT-1.1), a transcription factor (nuclear hormone receptor NHR-48), two MAPK-type protein kinases (SEK-1 and PMK-1), a nuclear localized O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT-1) and a member of large family of nuclear proteins related to the Rb-associated LIN-8 chromatin factor. These findings provide novel insights into the control of cellular plasticity.","De Novo, Divergence, and Mixed Origin Contribute to the Emergence of Orphan Genes in Pristionchus Nematodes.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31088903,"G3 (Bethesda, Md.)",2019 05 15,"Homology is a fundamental concept in comparative biology. It is extensively used at the sequence level to make phylogenetic hypotheses and functional inferences. Nonetheless, the majority of eukaryotic genomes contain large numbers of orphan genes lacking homologs in other taxa. Generally, the fraction of orphan genes is higher in genomically undersampled clades, and in the absence of closely related genomes any hypothesis about their origin and evolution remains untestable. Previously, we sequenced ten genomes with an underlying ladder-like phylogeny to establish a phylogenomic framework for studying genome evolution in diplogastrid nematodes. Here, we use this deeply sampled data set to understand the processes that generate orphan genes in our focal species Pristionchus pacificus Based on phylostratigraphic analysis and additional bioinformatic filters, we obtained 29 high-confidence candidate genes for which mechanisms of orphan origin were proposed based on manual inspection. This revealed diverse mechanisms including annotation artifacts, chimeric origin, alternative reading frame usage, and gene splitting with subsequent gain of de novo exons. In addition, we present two cases of complete de novo origination from non-coding regions, which represents one of the first reports of de novo genes in nematodes. Thus, we conclude that de novo emergence, divergence, and mixed mechanisms contribute to novel gene formation in Pristionchus nematodes.",A HORT1 retrotransposon insertion in the PeMYB11 promoter causes harlequin/black flowers in Phalaenopsis orchids.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31088902,Plant physiology,2019 05 15,"The harlequin/black flowers in Phalaenopsis orchids contain dark purple spots and various pigmentation patterns, which appeared as a new color in 1996. We analyzed this phenotype by microscopy, high-performance liquid chromatography, gene functional characterization, genome structure analysis, and transient overexpression system to obtain a better understanding of the black color formation in Phalaenopsis orchids. Most mesophyll cells of harlequin flowers showed extremely high accumulation of anthocyanins as well as a high expression of Phalaenopsis equestris MYB11 (PeMYB11) as the major regulatory R2R3-MYB transcription factor for regulating the production of the black color. In addition, we analyzed the expression of basic helix-loop-helix factors, WD40 repeat proteins, and MYB27- and MYBx-like repressors for their association with the spot pattern formation. To understand the high expression of PeMYB11 in harlequin flowers, we isolated the promoter sequences of PeMYB11 from red and harlequin flowers. A retrotransposon, named Harlequin Orchid RetroTransposon 1 (HORT1), was identified and inserted in the upstream regulatory region of PeMYB11. The insertion resulted in strong expression of PeMYB11 and thus extremely high accumulation of anthocyanins in the harlequin flowers of the P. Yushan Little Pearl variety. A dual luciferase assay showed that the insertion of HORT1 enhanced PeMYB11 expression by at least 2-fold compared with plants not carrying the insertion. Furthermore, the presence of HORT1 explains the high mutation rates resulting in many variations of pigmentation patterning in harlequin flowers of Phalaenopsis orchids.",Adiponectin and the risk of new-onset atrial fibrillation: a meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31088901,Bioscience reports,2019 06 11,"Background: Adiponectin has been suggested as a marker of many cardiovascular diseases. However, the association between serum adiponectin and incidence of atrial fibrillation (AF) in general population remains unclear. A meta-analysis was performed to systematically evaluate the potential influence of serum adiponectin at baseline on the incidence of AF during follow-up in general population.Methods: Prospective cohort studies were identified via electronic search of PubMed and Embase databases. A randomized effect model was applied to combine the results. Predefined subgroup analyses were performed to evaluate the influence of study characteristics on the association between baseline adiponectin and risk of new-onset AF.Results: Six cohort studies with 18558 community-derived participants were included, and 3165 AF cases were developed with a mean follow-up duration of up to 22 years. Meta-analysis showed that higher baseline circulating adiponectin was significantly associated with higher risk of new-onset AF during follow-up (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.17, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.08-1.27, P<0.001, I2 = 52%). Subgroup analyses showed that the association between adiponectin and new-onset AF was significant in studies with mean follow-up duration over 10 years (five cohorts, HR = 1.22, P<0.001), but not in that with a follow-up duration < 10 years (one cohort, HR = 0.95, P=0.51; P for subgroup difference = 0.002).Conclusions: Higher circulating adiponectin at baseline may be an independent risk factor for the development of new-onset AF during follow-up, particularly in cohort studies with longer follow-up durations."

Analyzing the underlying mechanism, we show here that inhibition of VE-PTP and activation of Tie-2 induce tyrosine phosphorylation of FGD5, a GTPase exchange factor (GEF) for Cdc42, and stimulate its translocation to cell contacts. Interfering with the expression of FGD5 blocks the junction-stabilizing effect of VE-PTP inhibition in vitro and in vivo Likewise, FGD5 is required for strengthening cortical actin bundles and inhibiting radial stress fiber formation, which are each stimulated by VE-PTP inhibition. We identify Y820 of FGD5 as the direct substrate for VE-PTP The phosphorylation of FGD5-Y820 is required for the stabilization of endothelial junctions and for the activation of Cdc42 by VE-PTP inhibition but is dispensable for the recruitment of FGD5 to endothelial cell contacts. Thus, activation of FGD5 is a two-step process that comprises membrane recruitment and phosphorylation of Y820.

Detecting true heterozygous sites in ancient genomes is complicated by the generally limited coverage achieved and the presence of post-mortem damage inflating sequencing errors. Additionally, large runs of homozygosity found in the genomes of particularly inbred individuals and of domestic animals can skew estimates of genome-wide heterozygosity rates. Current computational tools aimed at estimating runs of homozygosity and genome-wide heterozygosity levels are generally sensitive to such limitations. Here, we introduce ROHan, a probabilistic method which substantially improves the estimate of heterozygosity rates both genome-wide and for genomic local windows. It combines a local Bayesian model and a Hidden Markov Model at the genome-wide level and can work both on modern and ancient samples. We show that our algorithm outperforms currently available methods for predicting heterozygosity rates for ancient samples. Specifically, ROHan can delineate large runs of homozygosity (at megabase scales) and produce a reliable confidence interval for the genome-wide rate of heterozygosity outside of such regions from modern genomes with a depth of coverage as low as 5-6X and down to 7-8X for ancient samples showing moderate DNA damage. We apply ROHan to a series of modern and ancient genomes previously published and revise available estimates of heterozygosity for humans, chimpanzees and horses.",Human PRPF40B regulates hundreds of alternative splicing targets and represses a hypoxia expression signature.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31088860,"RNA (New York, N.Y.)",2019 05 15,"Altered splicing contributes to the pathogenesis of human blood disorders including MyeloDysplastic Syndromes (MDS) and leukemias. Here we characterized the transcriptomic regulation of PRPF40B, which is a splicing factor mutated in a small fraction of MDS patients. We generated a full PRPF40B knockout in K562 cell line by CRISPR/Cas9 technology, and rescued its levels by transient overexpression of wild-type, P383L or P540S MDS alleles. Using RNA sequencing we identified hundreds of differentially expressed genes and alternative splicing events in the knockout that are rescued by wild-type PRPF40B, with a majority also rescued by MDS alleles, pointing to mild effects of these mutations. Among the PRPF40B-regulated alternative splicing events, we found a net increase in exon inclusion in the knockout, suggesting that this splicing factor primarily acts as a repressor. PRPF40B-regulated splicing events are likely co-transcriptional, affect exons with A-rich downstream intronic motifs and weak splice sites especially for 5' splice sites, consistent with its PRP40 yeast ortholog being part of U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein. Loss of PRPF40B in K562 induces a KLF-1 transcriptional signature, genes involved in iron metabolism and mainly hypoxia, including related pathways like cholesterol biosynthesis and Akt/MAPK signaling. Cancer database analysis revealed that PRPF40B is lowly expressed in Acute Myeloid Leukemia while its paralog PRPF40A expression is high as opposed to solid tumors. Furthermore, these factors negatively or positively correlate with hypoxia regulator HIF1A, respectively. Our data suggest a PRPF40B role in repressing hypoxia in myeloid cells, and that its low expression might contribute to leukemogenesis."

Yet, since the first isolation of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) 20 years ago, followed by the successful reprogramming of human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) 10 years later, various studies shed light on abnormalities that sometimes accumulate in these cells in vitro Whereas genetic aberrations are well documented, epigenetic alterations are not as thoroughly discussed. In this review, we highlight frequent epigenetic aberrations found in hPSCs, including alterations in DNA methylation patterns, parental imprinting, and X chromosome inactivation. We discuss the potential origins of these abnormalities in hESCs and hiPSCs, survey the different methods for detecting them, and elaborate on their potential consequences for the different utilities of hPSCs.",Clonal selection with Ras pathway activation mediates secondary clinical resistance to selective FLT3 inhibition in acute myeloid leukemia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31088841,Cancer discovery,2019 06 10,"Gilteritinib is a potent and selective FLT3 kinase inhibitor with single-agent clinical efficacy in relapsed/refractory FLT3-mutated AML. In this context, however, gilteritinib is not curative and response duration is limited by the development of secondary resistance. To evaluate resistance mechanisms, we analyzed baseline and progression samples from patients treated on clinical trials of gilteritinib. Targeted next-generation sequencing at the time of AML progression on gilteritinib identified treatment-emergent mutations that activate RAS/MAPK pathway signaling, most commonly in NRAS or KRAS. Less frequently, secondary FLT3-F691L gatekeeper mutations or BCR-ABL1 fusions were identified at progression. Single-cell targeted DNA sequencing revealed diverse patterns of clonal selection and evolution in response to FLT3 inhibition, including the emergence of RAS mutations in FLT3-mutated subclones, the expansion of alternative FLT3-wild-type subclones, or both patterns simultaneously. These data illustrate dynamic and complex changes in clonal architecture underlying response and resistance to mutation-selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy in AML.",The Metabolic Basis of Kidney Cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31088840,Cancer discovery,2019 05 15,"Kidney cancer is not a single disease but represents several distinct types of cancer that have defining histologies and genetic alterations and that follow different clinical courses and have different responses to therapy. Mutation of genes associated with kidney cancer, such as VHL, FLCN, TFE3, FH, or SDHB, dysregulates the tumor's responses to changes in oxygen, iron, nutrient, or energy levels. The identification of these varying genetic bases of kidney cancer has increased our understanding of the biology of this cancer, allowing the development of targeted therapies and the appreciation that it is a cancer driven by metabolic alterations.Significance: Kidney cancer is a complex disease composed of different types of cancer that present with different histologies, clinical courses, genetic changes, and responses to therapy.

In multiple animal models, interference with netrin-1 is associated with inhibition of tumor growth and metastasis. Although netrin-1 upregulation was initially described in cancer cells, we report here that in the human colorectal cancer database, the expression of netrin-1 and its receptor UNC5B correlates with a cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) signature. Both colon and lung CAF secreted netrin-1 when co-cultured with respective cancer cells, and netrin-1 upregulation in CAF was associated with increased cancer cell stemness. Pharmacologic inhibition of netrin-1 with a netrin-1 monoclonal antibody (Net1-mAb) abrogated the CAF-mediated increase of cancer stemness both in co-culture experiments and in mice. Netrin-1 mAb inhibited intercellular signaling between CAF and cancer cells by modulating CAF-mediated expression of cytokines such as interleukin-6 (IL6). Together these data demonstrate that netrin-1 is upregulated not only in cancer cells but also in cancer-associated stromal cells. In addition to its direct activity on cancer cells, inhibition of netrin-1 may reduce pro-neoplastic CAF-cancer cell crosstalk, thus inhibiting cancer plasticity.",Magnetic resonance imaging is more sensitive than PET for detecting treatment-induced cell death-dependent changes in glycolysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31088837,Cancer research,2019 05 15,"Metabolic imaging has been widely used to measure the early responses of tumors to treatment. Here we assess the abilities of positron emission tomography (PET) measurement of [18F]FDG uptake and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measurement of hyperpolarized [1-13C]pyruvate metabolism to detect early changes in glycolysis following treatment-induced cell death in human colorectal (Colo205) and breast adenocarcinoma (MDA-MB-231) xenografts in mice. A TRAIL agonist that binds to human but not mouse cells induced tumor-selective cell death. Tumor glycolysis was assessed by injecting [1,6-13C2]glucose and measuring 13C-labeled metabolites in tumor extracts. Injection of hyperpolarized [1-13C]pyruvate induced rapid reduction in lactate labeling. This decrease, which correlated with an increase in histological markers of cell death and preceded decrease in tumor volume, reflected reduced flux from glucose to lactate and decreased lactate concentration. However, [18F]FDG uptake and phosphorylation was maintained following treatment, which has been attributed previously to increased [18F]FDG uptake by infiltrating immune cells. Quantification of [18F]FDG uptake in flow-sorted tumor and immune cells from disaggregated tumors identified CD11b+/CD45+ macrophages as the most [18F]FDG-avid cell type present, yet they represented <5% of the cells present in the tumors and could not explain the failure of [18F]FDG-PET to detect treatment response. MRI measurement of hyperpolarized [1-13C]pyruvate metabolism is therefore a more sensitive marker of the early decreases in glycolytic flux that occur following cell death than PET measurements of [18F]FDG uptake.",DFMO and 5-azacytidine increase M1 macrophages in the tumor microenvironment of murine ovarian cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31088836,Cancer research,2019 06 10,"Although ovarian cancer has a low incidence rate, it remains the most deadly gynecologic malignancy. Previous work has demonstrated that the DNMTi 5-Azacytidine (AZA) activates type I interferon signaling to increase IFNγ+ T cells and NK cells and reduce the percentage of macrophages in the tumor microenvironment. To improve the efficacy of epigenetic therapy, we hypothesized that the addition of α-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO), an ornithine decarboxylase inhibitor, may further decrease immunosuppressive cell populations improving outcome. We tested this hypothesis in an immunocompetent mouse model for ovarian cancer and found that in vivo, AZA and DFMO, either alone or in combination, significantly increased survival, decreased tumor burden, and caused recruitment of activated (IFNγ+) CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and NK cells. The combination therapy had a striking increase in survival when compared to single agent treatment, despite a smaller difference in recruited lymphocytes. Instead, combination therapy led to a significant decrease in immunosuppressive cells such as M2 polarized macrophages and an increase in tumor-killing M1 macrophages. In this model, depletion of macrophages with a CSF1R-blocking antibody reduced the efficacy of AZA+DFMO treatment and resulted in fewer M1 macrophages in the tumor microenvironment. These observations suggest our novel combination therapy modifies macrophage polarization in the tumor microenvironment, recruiting M1 macrophages and prolonging survival.",Radiation-induced DNA damage cooperates with heterozygosity of TP53 and PTEN to generate high grade gliomas.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31088835,Cancer research,2019 05 15,"Glioblastomas (GBM) are lethal brain tumors which are treated with conventional radiation (X-rays and gamma rays) or particle radiation (protons and carbon ions). Paradoxically, radiation is also a risk factor for GBM development, raising the possibility that radiotherapy of brain tumors could promote tumor recurrence or trigger secondary gliomas. In this study, we determined whether tumor suppressor losses commonly displayed by GBM patients confer susceptibility to radiation-induced glioma. Mice with Nestin-Cre-driven deletions of Trp53 and Pten alleles were intracranially irradiated with X-rays or charged particles of increasing atomic number and linear energy transfer (LET). Mice with loss of one allele each of Trp53 and Pten did not develop spontaneous gliomas but were highly-susceptible to radiation-induced gliomagenesis. Tumor development frequency after exposure to high-LET particle radiation was significantly higher compared to X-rays, in accordance with the irreparability of DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) induced by high-LET radiation. All resultant gliomas, regardless of radiation quality, presented histopathological features of grade IV lesions and harbored populations of cancer stem-like cells with tumor-propagating properties. Furthermore, all tumors displayed concomitant loss of heterozygosity of Trp53 and Pten along with frequent amplification of the Met receptor tyrosine kinase, which conferred a stem cell phenotype to tumor cells. Our results demonstrate that radiation-induced DSB cooperate with pre-existing tumor suppressor losses to generate high grade gliomas. Moreover, our mouse model can be used for studies on radiation-induced development of GBM and therapeutic strategies.",Exosomal Induction of Tumor Innervation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31088834,Cancer research,2019 06 12,"The naïve view of tumors as isolated islands of rogue cells has given way to a deeper understanding of cancer as being closer to a foreign organ. This ""organ"" contains immunologic, vascular, and neural connections to its host that provide not only mechanisms for disease progression but also opportunities for therapeutic intervention. The presence of nerves within tumor tissues has long been appreciated. However, a mechanistic understanding of how tumors recruit nerves has been slower to emerge. Tumor release of neurotrophic factors and axonal guidance molecules likely directs axons toward the tumor bed. Newly emerging data support a contribution of tumor-released exosomes in the induction of axonogenesis toward the tumor. Exosomes, small membrane-bound vesicles that carry a complex cargo (DNA, RNA, miRNA, lipids, and proteins), protect their cargo from the low pH of the tumor microenvironment. They also represent an efficient means of local and distal communication between the tumor and potentially innervating nerves. Likely, a combination of neurotrophins, guidance molecules, and exosomes work in concert to promote tumor innervation. As such, defining the critical components driving tumor innervation will identify new targets for intervention. Moreover, with a deepening understanding, tumor innervation may emerge as a new hallmark of cancer.",Inhibition of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase enhances the antitumor efficacy of oncolytic reovirus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31088833,Cancer research,2019 05 15,"Oncolytic viruses (OV) such as reovirus preferentially infect and kill cancer cells. Thus, the mechanisms that dictate the susceptibility of cancer cells to OV-induced cytotoxicity hold the key to their success in clinics. Here we investigated whether cancer cell metabolism defines its susceptibility to OV, and if OV-induced metabolic perturbations can be therapeutically targeted. Using mass spectrometry-based metabolomics and extracellular flux analysis on a panel of cancer cell lines with varying degrees of susceptibility to reovirus, we found that OV-induced changes in central energy metabolism, pyruvate metabolism, and oxidative stress correlate with their susceptibility to reovirus. In particular, reovirus infection accentuated Warburg-like metabolic perturbations in cell lines relatively resistant to oncolysis. These metabolic changes were facilitated by oxidative stress-induced inhibitory phosphorylation of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) that impaired the routing of pyruvate into the TCA cycle and established a metabolic state unsupportive of OV replication. From the therapeutic perspective, reactivation of PDH in cancer cells that were weakly sensitive for reovirus, either through PDH kinase (PDK) inhibitors dichloroacetate and AZD7545 or shRNA-specific depletion of PDK1, enhanced the efficacy of reovirus-induced oncolysis in vitro and in vivo. These findings identify targeted metabolic reprogramming as a possible combination strategy to enhance the antitumour effects of OV in clinics."

Infants were separated into two groups: breast milk (BM) dominant group (n = 30) receiving ≥70% of Mg intake from BM and mixed-fed (MF) group (n = 85) receiving ≥30% of Mg intake from formula. Blood levels of Mg, iMg, Ca, and iCa at day 1 of age and at discharge from the hospital were compared between the groups. No differences in the Mg and iMg levels at day 1 of age were observed between the two groups. The Mg and iMg levels at discharge were significantly lower (P < 0.05) in the BM group than in the MF group; 0.86 (interquartile range 0.81-0.91) versus 0.91 (0.86-0.99) mmol/L and 0.46 (0.41-0.51) versus 0.52 (0.47-0.57) mmol/L, respectively.

The level of particle wall adhesion was measured for varying levels of shear rate and varying degrees of red blood cell aggregation, which was modulated by the addition of macromolecule dextran 500. The blood preparations were injected into PDMS microfluidic devices that were modified to have circular channels, better matching the geometry of physiological microcirculation compared to square channels or Couette flow systems. The circular walls of the microchannels were embedded with biotinylated phospholipids to which marginating microspheres coated with streptavidin bound. The particle wall adhesion was evaluated by counting the particles adhering to the channel wall after flushing the channel. Blood preparations of five dextran concentrations (including baseline case of 0%) were tested for four flow velocities, to quantify the effects of aggregation for varying shear rate. It was found that the level of particle wall adhesion was positively correlated with the level of RBC aggregation, particularly at low shear rates, when aggregation was enhanced. The particle adhesion was especially enhanceat aggregation levels in the range of physiological aggregation levels of whole blood, suggesting that RBC aggregation plays an important role in the dynamic of platelets and leukocytes in vivo.",Chemotherapy and Radiation Versus Chemotherapy Alone for Elderly Patients With N3 Stage IIIB NSCLC.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31088760,Clinical lung cancer,2019 05 15,"Standard treatment for stage III non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is concurrent chemotherapy and radiation (chemo-RT).

Hence, wave speed could be used to infer tendon load provided that the wave speed-stress relationship can be calibrated and remains robust across loading conditions. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of loading rate and fluid immersion on the wave speed-stress relationship in ex vivo tendons, and to assess potential calibration techniques. Tendon wave speed and axial stress were measured in 20 porcine digital flexor tendons during cyclic (0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 Hz) or static axial loading. Squared wave speed was highly correlated to stress (r2avg = 0.98) and was insensitive to loading rate (p = 0.57). The constant of proportionality is the effective density, which reflects the density of the tendon tissue and additional effective mass added by the adjacent fluid. Effective densities of tendons vibrating in a saline bath averaged 1680 kg/m3 and added mass effects caused wave speeds to be 22% lower on average in a saline bath than in air. The root-mean-square error between predicted and measured stress was 0.67 MPa (6.7% of maximum stress) when using tendon-specific calibration parameters. These errors increased to 1.31 MPa (13.1% of maximum stress) when calibrating based on group-compiled data from ten tendons. These results support the feasibility of calculating absolute tendon stresses from wave speed squared based on linear calibration relationships.",Undisturbed stance on a double seesaw: Interaction between asymmetries of the center-of-pressure patterns under each foot and weight-bearing.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31088752,Journal of biomechanics,2019 05 29,"Both center-of-pressure (CP) displacements under each foot and relative body-weight distribution intervene in the production of resultant CP movements. To better understand their respective involvement, a protocol was set up for young healthy individuals consisting in standing on a double seesaw, favoring pitch motions and laying on a dual-force platform. The postural control effects induced by two types of asymmetry, weight-bearing and the CP movement patterns, were investigated. These asymmetries were achieved by associating two seesaws with two different lengths for the radii of the ridges and by requiring specific body-weight distributions. The results indicate that the postural strategies, aimed at controlling anteroposterior sway, are related to the subjects' capacity to minimize the CP displacements under the less stable support, whatever load is applied. In contrast, the degree of involvement of the more stable support must be viewed as a complement used to secure the appropriate motor output, i.e., the resultant CP movements. Within this objective, both the applied load and the CP amplitudes under the more stable support are taken into account. These data provide additional insights into the compensatory mechanisms between the interactions between the two feet, which are used to produce the adequate resultant CP movements and therefore upright stance control. The specificity of the double seesaw that can induce asymmetric CP patterns and/or asymmetric body-weight distribution makes it a legitimate contender to be used as a rehabilitation device for patients with neurological and/or traumatic diseases.",Transient visual impairment in a patient with psychogenic fever: A case report.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31088751,The American journal of emergency medicine,2019 05 15,"Psychogenic fever is a stress-related psychosomatic disease and has been recognized clinically since the early twentieth century.

Invasive CVP measurements have inherent and non-negligible complication rates as well as great expenditures. Several noninvasive methods of CVP measurements, like ultrasound-guided techniques, are available, but require trained skills and special equipment which might not be at hand in all situations. Our purpose was to evaluate the feasibility and accuracy of CVP estimates assessed upon the height of hand veins collapse (HVC) using invasively measured CVP as the gold standard. The HVC was determined by slowly lifting the patient's hand while watching the dorsal hand veins to collapse. The vertical distance from the dorsal hand to a transducer air zero port was noted and converted to mmHg. The observer was blinded to the simultaneously measured CVP values, which were categorized as low (<7 mmHg), normal (7-12 mmHg) and high (>12 mmHg). Measurements were performed in 82 patients who had a median [IQR] age of 67 [60;74]. Median CVP was 12 [8;15] mmHg and the median absolute difference between the measured HVC and CVP was 4 [2;7] mmHg. The Spearman correlation coefficient between CVP and HVC was 0.55, 95%-CI [0.35;0.69]. Overall CVP categorization was correct in 45% of the cases. HVC had a sensitivity of 92% for a low CVP with a negative predictive value of 98%. A high HVC had a sensitivity of 29% but a high specificity of 94% for a high CVP. The overall performance of observing the hand vein collapse to estimate CVP was only moderate in the intensive care setting. However, the median difference to the CVP was low and HVC identifies a low CVP with a high sensitivity and excellent negative predictive value."

To fully utilize LTCA as a fertilizer, this study investigated a procedure for P recovery from LTCA via struvite crystallization with fewer impurities. The adsorption characteristics of P and Fe by cation exchange resin (CER) were explored by simulating using the macroscopic parametric equation Thomas model. Optimum purification conditions for P-rich leachate by cation exchange column method were determined. Results showed that approximately 97.21 wt% of P was extracted from LTCA at HCl concentration of 0.8 M and liquid/solid ratio of 20.0 ml/g. More than 90 wt% of impurities could be detached by making P-rich leachate flow through cation exchange bed filled by CER at 300 ml/h.

Through on-farm processing, about 80% of cocoa fruit is discarded as residual biomass, including cocoa pod husks, cocoa bean shells and cocoa sweatings. Farmers routinely discard these residues/by-products during the initial cocoa bean processing steps, occupying vast areas and raising social and environmental concerns. Alternatively, this residual biomass is used as cocoa tree fertilizer. However, its disposal is performed without proper treatment, resulting in putrid odors and plant diseases. Recently, some studies have reported the use of cocoa by-products in the production of high-value-adding molecules with potential applications in the food, pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries. In this aspect, biotechnological approaches have been shown to be a viable alternative for the transformation of this residual biomass into fine products. This article reviews the biotechnological approaches implemented for the management and exploitation of cocoa by-product. Related topics on cocoa production and residual biomass generation, sustainability and valorization of cocoa chain are addressed and discussed.","Life Cycle Assessment of prospective MSW management based on integrated management planning in Campo Grande, Brazil.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31088674,"Waste management (New York, N.Y.)",2019 05 15,"A crucial first step in transforming problematic waste management into sustainable integrated systems is comprehensive planning and analysis of environmental and socio-economic effects. The work presented here is a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) that addressed the environmental performance of prospective development pathways for the municipal solid waste (MSW) management system in a large urban area, i.e. Campo Grande, Brazil. The research built on data and expanded the main development pathway proposed in the municipalities integrated waste management plan, which covers a period of 20 years (2017-2037). The system progression was assessed for milestone years (5-year intervals) considering projections of future population and waste generation growth, as well as addressing the development of surrounding systems, such as energy production. Results reveal that the rather conservative planned development pathway, which is largely based on gradual increase in selective collection, could successfully counter negative environmental externalities that would otherwise materialize due to increasing waste generation. A second, more ambitious, pathway with additionally scheduled actions to treat mixed MSW and upgrade certain treatment technologies (e.g. from composting to anaerobic digestion of collected organics), was used to illustrate a potential range for significantly higher impact reduction and even positive externalities, given a zero burden approach before waste generation.",Energy efficient production of glass-ceramics using photovoltaic (P/V) glass and lignite fly ash.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31088673,"Waste management (New York, N.Y.)",2019 05 15,"This study investigates an innovative approach for the valorization of specific wastes generated from the energy sector and the production of glass-ceramics. The wastes used were photovoltaic (P/V) glass, produced from the renewable energy sector, and lignite fly ash, produced from the conventional energy sector. The process first involved the production of glass after melting specific mixtures of wastes, namely (i) 70% P/V glass and 30% lignite fly ash, and (ii) 80% P/V glass and 20% lignite fly ash, at 1200 °C for 1 h as revealed by the use of a heating microscope. The results indicated that the P/V glass, as a sodium-potassium-rich inorganic waste, reduces energy requirements of the melting process. The produced glass was then used for the production of glass-ceramics. Dense and homogeneous glass-ceramics, exhibiting high chemical stability and no toxicity, were produced after controlled thermal treatment of glass at 800 °C. The mechanical (compressive strength, Vickers hardness) and physical (open porosity, bulk density and water absorption) properties of the produced glass-ceramics were evaluated. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Energy Dispersive X-ray fluorescence (ED-XRF) were used for the characterization of the raw materials and the produced glass-ceramics. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) provided further insights on the microstructure of the final products. The properties of the produced glass-ceramics, namely water absorption and compressive strength, render them suitable for applications in the construction industry. The waste valorization approach followed in this study is in line with the principles of circular economy.",A theoretical study on municipal solid waste plasma gasification.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31088672,"Waste management (New York, N.Y.)",2019 05 15,"Gasification is an innovative and effective process which reduces the amount of waste produced by society and affords a synthetic gas with diverse applicability. In this plasma gasification study at high temperatures, a previously developed Aspen Plus model was used for municipal solid waste (MSW). The study is focused on the behavior of the equivalence ratio (ER), steam to MSW (S/MSW) ratio and gasification temperature (T), as a function of three gasification agents (air, O2 and steam), assessing the final syngas composition. The model was validated with results from literature. The highest hydrogen yield reached 64% (molar fraction), when steam was used as gasification agent, lower values corresponding to O2 utilization. Instead, a CO-enriched syngas was achieved under O2 atmosphere (58%). Enhanced lower heating value (LHV) was obtained for the syngas produced when ER = 1, under oxygen atmosphere at 1500 °C (13 MJ/Nm3). This is due to the formation of CO, promoted by O2, which constitutes an important factor in enhancing syngas LHV. Tar presence in the gasification process normally implies significant complications, but in this study, no problems were noticed since gasification occurred at higher temperatures.",Highly efficient treatment of textile dyeing sludge by CO2 thermal plasma gasification.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31088671,"Waste management (New York, N.Y.)",2019 05 15,"Textile dyeing sludge is complex hazardous material with increasing amount year by year, and the conventional treatment techniques are limited by many drawbacks such as water/soil contamination, incomplete degradation of hazardous organics or inefficient fixation of toxic heavy metals. This work reported the first example of thermal plasma gasification treatment of textile dyeing sludge in a homemade rotating arc plasma reactor, which not only significantly reduced the volume and eliminated the safety risk of textile dyeing sludge, but also produced valuable syngas that can be used for chemical industry. At a feed rate of 36 g/min and a CO2 flow rate of 0.43 Nm3/h (14.08 g/min), the carbon conversion efficiency of gasification was 99.9%; and the energy conversion efficiency could reach 71.8%; and the lower heating value of syngas-rich produced gas was 8.91 MJ/Nm3. At the same time, the volume reduction ratio of sludge was 41.19% and the fixing efficiency of the heavy metals in solid products reached above 99%.

Here a facile amino functionalization strategy was first proposed to enhance the surface functionality of sewage sludge derived biochar (SSDB) via the combination of sol-gel process for mesoporous silica coating and silylation for highly selective removal of Cu(II). The prepared amino-functionalized SSDB showed excellent adsorption capacity of 74.51 mg/g at room temperature, increasing by nearly 118% with regard to the unfunctionalized SSDB, and prominent selectivity (minute separation factor SFCo, Ni, Zn/Cu) toward Cu(II) uptake. Characterizations demonstrated amine groups on the SSDB, the surface density of which reached 1.34 mg/m2. The adsorption kinetics of Cu(II) on amino-functionalized SSDB was well described by a pseudo-second order kinetic model while the adsorption isotherm data was well fitted by Sips model. The pH range in which the adsorption preferentially occurred was 3-5. The occurrence of amine group protonation undermined adsorption performance at a pH < 3. These effects of amino-functionalized SSDB toward Cu(II) uptake were a result of the grafted amine groups specifically complexing with Cu(II) in the tetrahedron. Hence, prominent adsorption performance and low-cost feedstock make amino-functionalized SSDB a sustainable adsorbent for Cu(II) removal in water resulting in a cleaner utilization of sewage sludge.",Valorisation of surplus food in the French retail sector: Environmental and economic impacts.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31088669,"Waste management (New York, N.Y.)",2019 05 15,"The retail sector, generating large amounts of food waste in a limited and well-defined number of locations, represents a unique opportunity for the implementation of waste minimisation policies targeting food waste and surplus food. France has introduced policy measures forcing retailers to prioritise the redistribution of surplus food to charity (donation) and/or diversion to animal feed. To evaluate the environmental benefits from such initiatives, this study provides a bottom-up consequential life cycle assessment of surplus food management at twenty retail outlets in France. A cradle-to-grave assessment was performed, including land-use changes, and the impacts were evaluated for ten impact categories. Four scenarios were considered, using monthly data on waste flows and management. Alongside assessing the current management (i.e. redistribution and/or use of surplus food for animal feed with anaerobic digestion and incineration of residual streams), three additional scenarios were evaluated: (i) prevention (used as benchmark), (ii) anaerobic digestion and (iii) incineration. The results demonstrated that redistribution leads to substantial environmental savings when accounting for all potentially induced benefits, second only to prevention but nevertheless of similar magnitude. Neither anaerobic digestion nor incineration can compete environmentally with redistribution and use as animal feed, especially in a low-carbon energy system. A cost analysis, including tax credits implemented in the French regulation, demonstrated that retailers donating high-value products also achieved lower costs and higher environmental savings overall. The results clearly suggest that similar initiatives should be encouraged, and the study offers a consistent basis for evaluating similar initiatives also for other countries.",Technical implications and global warming potential of recovering nitrogen released during continuous thermal drying of sewage sludge.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31088668,"Waste management (New York, N.Y.)",2019 05 15,"Thermal drying and consequent incineration of sewage sludge result in an absolute loss of an important macronutrient - nitrogen. To fulfill the growing food demand, humanity relies more on industrial fixation of nitrogen, primarily via the Haber-Bosch process. The present paper examines the nitrogen release during continuous thermal drying of municipal sewage sludge and its consequent recovery for fertilization. Furthermore, the possibility of nitrogen recovery from condensate is assessed. Finally, the study assesses the global warming potential of the proposed nitrogen recovery system and compares it with the baseline system manufacturing fertilizers from industrially fixed nitrogen. The results of the drying experiments showed that 0.73-1.03 g N-NH3 kg-1 total solids of sewage sludge was released to off-gases during its continuous thermal drying under 160 °C, which corresponds to 41-58% of ionized nitrogen content in raw sewage sludge subjected to thermal drying. The global warming potential of the nitrogen recovery was 28% lower compared to that of the commercial fertilizer production of equivalent properties: 4.1 kg CO2-Equiv. kg-1 N versus 5.7 kg CO2-Equiv. kg-1 N. Still, the sensitivity analysis showed that the results might traverse and lead to a higher global warming potential of 6.2 kg CO2-Equiv. during the nitrogen recovery process under certain process parameters.",A review of the animal disease outbreaks and biosecure animal mortality composting systems.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31088667,"Waste management (New York, N.Y.)",2019 05 15,"Despite the development of new vaccines and the application of rigorous biosecurity measures, animal diseases pose a continuing threat to animal health, food safety, national economy, and the environment. Intense livestock production, increased travel, and changing climate have increased the risk of catastrophic animal losses due to infectious diseases. In the event of an outbreak, it is essential to properly manage the infected animals to prevent the spread of diseases. The most common disposal methods used during a disease outbreak include burial, landfilling, incineration and composting. Biosecurity, transportation logistics, public perception, and environmental concerns limit the use of some of these methods. During a disease outbreak, the large number of mortalities often exceeds the capacity of local rendering plants and landfills. Transporting mortalities to disposal and incineration facilities outside the production operation introduces biosecurity risks. Burying mortalities is limited by the size and availability of suitable sites and it has the risk of pathogen survival and contamination of groundwater and soil. Portable incinerators are expensive and have the potential to aerosolize infectious particles. Composting, on the other hand, has been recognized as a biosecure disposal method. Research showed that it eliminates bacterial pathogens such as Escherichia coli O157: H7, Salmonella spp., as well as viruses including highly pathogenic avian influenza, foot-and-mouth disease, Newcastle disease, and porcine epidemic diarrhea. This paper summarizes the lessons learned during the major animal disease outbreaks including the 2010 foot-and-mouth disease, 2016 highly pathogenic avian influenza, and recent African swine fever outbreaks. The purpose of this review is to critically discuss the biosecurity of composting as a mortality disposal method during the outbreaks of infectious animal diseases."

However, its immune related adverse events (irAEs) can be debilitating and life threatening. Immune therapy-induced diarrhea (ITID) is one of the most commonly encountered irAEs and can lead to expensive and prolonged hospitalizations. The current standard of care for grade 3 or 4 ITID involves ICPi discontinuation, the initiation of steroids, and infliximab for refractory disease. This treatment regimen reverses the desired anti-tumor effect of ICPis, can lead to side effects, and is cost-ineffective. We report the first case of the successful treatment of grade 3 ITID with steroids and an amino acid-based oral rehydration solution (AA-ORS), enterade. Research suggests that AA-ORS may be used to reduce diarrhea and adequately hydrate patients, in contrast to glucose-based oral rehydration solutions, which have been implicated as a contributing factor to diarrhea in cancer patients. We hypothesize that an AA-ORS may mitigate ITID via safer and more economically viable means than the current standard of care, but more controlled trials are needed to test this hypothesis.",Hypothetical role of gravity in Rapid Eye Movements during sleep.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31088650,Medical hypotheses,2019 05 15,"Dream periods during sleep have been observed in most mammals as early in history as antiquity. Sleep researchers at the University of Chicago, discovered the phase of rapid eye movement (REM) during sleep and connected it to the dream period. During this period, called the REM phase (after the American terminology), although the brain shows electrical activity, it is insensitive to external stimulations, including light, sound, contact and, a little unexpectedly, gravity. However, since this discovery was mаde there has been no definitive explanation of the rapid eye movements Many possible explanations have been offered, and yet, the causes and contributing factors of the REM sleep phase are inadequately understood. It has often been proposed that the eyes observe the images produced during dreams, but researchers are not convinced. It is proposed here that the movements of the eyes during REM sleep are due to a feeling of disorientation and a subjective loss of landmarks. During the REM sleep phase, the brain has a reduced sensation of gravity, and the sleeper is in a state similar to weightlessness. The instinctive search for the vertical or horizontal direction triggers movements of the eyes, looking for usual points of reference. This hypothesis is reinforced by an original experiment that was conducted in space. The frequency of the eye movements of astronauts during their first night in space is 10 times more than what is experienced on the ground, and that moment in time is when the feeling or the sensation of weightlessness is certainly the most disturbing. Upon the return to Earth, the frequency of the eye movements increases again the first night after landing. These two moments are when the effects of gravity are felt most drastically. The present assumption needs to be validated experimentally and may necessitate further research.",The 22q11.2 deletion syndrome as a model for idiopathic scoliosis - A hypothesis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31088649,Medical hypotheses,2019 05 15,"Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS), defined as a lateral deviation of the spine of at least ten degrees, is a classic enigma in orthopaedics and affects 1-4% of the general population. Despite (over) a century of intensive research, the etiology is still largely unknown. One of the major problems in all existing AIS research is the fact that most patients come to medical attention after onset of the curve. Therefore, it is impossible to know whether current investigated parameters are causative, or an effect of the scoliosis. Moreover, up until now there is no known animal model that captures the core features of AIS. In order to identify causal pathways leading to AIS we propose another approach, which has been of great value in other medical disciplines: To use a subset of the population, with a higher risk for a certain disease as a ""model"" for the general population. Such a ""model"" may allow the identification of causative mechanisms that might be applicable to the general population. The 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS) is the most common microdeletion syndrome and occurs in ∼1:3000-6000 children and 1:1000 pregnancies. Nearly half of the population of patients with 22q11.2DS develop a scoliosis that in most cases resembles AIS as far as age at onset and curve pattern. We postulate that within 22q11.2DS certain causal pathways leading to scoliosis can be identified and that these are applicable to the general population.",Mucociliary transport as a link between chronic rhinosinusitis and trace element dysbalance.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31088648,Medical hypotheses,2019 05 15,"Chronis rhinosinusitis is considered as a widespread public health issue with a prevalence of 10%. The disease significantly reduces quality of life and increases the risk of cardiovascular diseases as well as certain forms of cancer. Alteration of mucociliary clearance frequently observed in the patients and plays a significant role in disease pathogenesis. Certain studies have demonstrated that patients with chronic rhinosinusitis are characterized by significant reduction of essential trace elements and toxic metal overload. However, the particular mechanisms of the role of trace element dysbalance in chronic rhinosinusitis are unclear. We hypothesize that exposure to toxic trace elements (arsenic, nickel, cadmium) damages ciliary mucosal epithelium thus affecting mucociliary transport. In turn, altered mucociliary transport results in reduced removal of the inhaled metal-containing particles from nasal mucosa leading to their absorption and further aggravation of toxicity. Essential trace elements (zinc, selenium) play a significant role in regulation of mucociliary transport and immunity, thus their deficiency (either dietary or due to antagonism with toxic metals) may be associated with impaired functions and increased toxic metal toxicity. Therefore, a vicious circle involving metal accumulation and toxicity, essential element deficiency, impairment of mucociliary transport and metal particle removal, resulting in further accumulation of metals and aggravation of toxic effects is formed. The present hypothesis is supported by the findings on the impact of trace elements especially zinc and arsenic on mucociliary clearance, the role of mucociliary transport in heavy metal particles elimination from the airways, trace element dysbalance in chronic rhinosinusitis, as well as toxic and essential metal antagonism. The data from hypothesis testing and its verification may be used for development of therapeutic approach for management of chronic rhinosinusitis. Particularly, the use of essential elements (zinc, selenium) may reduce toxic metal toxicity thus destroying the vicious circle of heavy metal exposure, toxicity, alteration of mucociliary clearance, and aggravation of chronic rhinosinusitis. Essential element supplementation may be considered as a tool for management of chronic refractory rhinosinusitis. In addition, analysis of essential and toxic trace element status may provide an additional diagnostic approach to risk assessment of chronic rhinosinusitis in highly polluted environments.",Sarcopenia as a potential cause of chronic hyponatremia in the elderly.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31088646,Medical hypotheses,2019 05 15,"Hyponatremia is the most frequent electrolyte disorder found in clinical practice, particularly in hospitalized elderly patients, where it is associated with fractures, falls, hospital readmission, prolonged hospital stay and increased mortality. Pathophysiologically, hyponatremia can be induced by the reduction in sodium or potassium body content, and/or the increase in water body content. Sarcopenia is an ageing-associated progressive and generalized loss of musculoskeletal mass and strength which leads to low physical performance, particularly in the frail elderly. Since muscle mass is the main potassium body store, this condition usually represents a reduced body potassium content. In the present article it is hypothesized that sarcopenia, as a cause of low potassium body content, could induce or co-induce hyponatremia, particularly in elderly individuals suffering from frailty phenotype.",Emotion recognition through EEG phase space dynamics and Dempster-Shafer theory.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31088645,Medical hypotheses,2019 05 15,"Emotions play an important role in our life. Emotion recognition which is considered a subset of brain computer interface (BCI), has drawn a great deal of attention during recent years. Researchers from different fields have tried to classify emotions through physiological signals. Nonlinear analysis has been reported to be successful and effective in emotion classification due to the nonlinear and non-stationary behavior of biological signals. In this study, phase space reconstruction and Poincare planes are employed to describe the dynamics of electroencephalogram (EEG) in emotional states. EEG signals are taken from a reliable database and phase space is reconstructed. A new transformation is introduced in order to quantify the phase space. Dynamic characteristics of the new space are considered as features. Most significant features are selected and samples are classified into four groups including high arousal - high valence (HAHV), low arousal - high valence (LAHV), high arousal - low valence (HALV) and low arousal - low valence (LALV). Classification accuracy was about 90% on average. Results suggest that the proposed method is successful and classification performance is good in comparison with most studies in this field. Brain activity is also reported with respect to investigating brain function during emotion elicitation. We managed to introduce a new way to analyze EEG phase space. The proposed method is applied in a real world and challenging application (i.e. emotion classification). Not only does the proposed method describe EEG changes due to different emotional states but also it is able to represent new characteristics of complex systems. The suggested approach paves the way for researchers to analyze and understand more about chaotic signals and systems.",Improving autism perinatal risk factors: A systematic review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31088644,Medical hypotheses,2019 05 15,"Current understanding of the etiology of autism is based on the interaction of multiple genes with each other and with environmental factors, leading to a neurodevelopmental process that results in the expression of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in the child.

Corticosteroids have not had a curative effect on the hyperthyroidism of Graves' disease despite their effectiveness for other autoimmune diseases. Two kinds of TSHRAb, thyroid-stimulating Ab (TSAb) and thyroid-blocking Ab (TBAb), are known as causal factors of hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism, respectively. Previously, we reported that TSAb may be thyroid stimulating animal IgG-like hormone and TBAb may be the precursor of TSAb. In this paper we suggested that TBAb (precursor) converts to TSAb (active form) via the action of the protease, colloid antigen 2 (CA2). We speculate that the conversion of TBAb to TSAb is controlled by two factors: the protease and an anti-protease Ab. When anti-protease Ab levels are high, the patient exhibits hypothyroidism due to the increase in TBAb levels caused by neutralization of the protease. When anti-protease Ab levels are negative, the patient's hypothyroidism disappeared by the negative serum TBAb due to increased protease. An immunoglobulin G (IgG) with enzyme activity is known as an abzyme, which may be an undeveloped form. IgG with hormone activity may be likewise called an abhormone, which could also be an undeveloped form. The tumor marker CEA is a known member of the IgG supergene family. Many ancestral versions of proteins may have been produced as an IgG form. Possible participation of colloid antigen 2 and abhormone for the etiology of Graves' disease is suggested.",Treatment resistance in major depression is correlated with increased plasma levels of neurofilament light protein reflecting axonal damage.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31088642,Medical hypotheses,2019 05 15,"Treatment resistant major depression is accompanied with a sizable impact on quality of life with severe consequences for social integrity, individual health and socioeconomic state. In- and outpatient care of patients with treatment resistant major depression remains very challenging for both patients and the health system. One reason is the limited knowledge on the etiology of treatment resistance in major depression resulting difficulties developing efficient treatment strategies for this group of severe depressed patients. Therefore, new focuses on research are needed. Biomarkers reliably reflecting neuropathological processes could help to understand the actual mechanisms in treatment resistance. Neurofilament light protein might be a reliable biomarker of axonal damage in the brain. Due to accumulating evidence that major depression is associated with axonal damage, it is our hypothesis that treatment resistant major depression is correlated with persistent axonal damage within circuits processing affective responses. Axonal damage is reflected by increased levels of neurofilament light protein in plasma. To evaluate our hypothesis, neurofilament light protein will be measured in a group of patients with homogeneous symptomatology of treatment resistant major depression.",The vitamin D positive feedback hypothesis of inflammatory bowel diseases.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31088641,Medical hypotheses,2019 05 15,"While it appears that there are a variety of factors that exacerbate IBD, it is frustrating that symptoms can persist and worsen even when environmental insults are removed. We suggest that there may be a positive feedback loop which perpetuates the inflammatory response in IBD patients. The loop is triggered by vitamin D deficiency which reduces calcium uptake. Lowered vitamin D and calcium interfere with anti-inflammatory pathways. Inflammation of the mucosa inhibits absorption of calcium and thus perpetuates the reduced anti-inflammatory response. A number of predictions follow from this hypothesis and are supported by geographic and lifestyle patterns in IBD incidence and prevalence."

The primary objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate whether maternal DHA status changed across gestation. Changes in levels of other key polyunsaturated fatty acids were also investigated.,Associations of medium and long chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids with blood pressure in Hispanic and non-Hispanic smokers and nonsmokers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31088622,"Prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and essential fatty acids",2019 05 18,"Epidemiology studies and clinical trials have shown that omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) are inversely associated with blood pressure. We sought to determine the influence of cigarette smoking and Hispanic ethnicity on this association. Age- and sex-matched smokers and nonsmokers (n = 98) 19-50 years old lacking cardiovascular disease were recruited. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP, DBP), heart rate, HbA1c, lipids, BMI, and RBC fatty acids were measured. The omega-3 index (percent eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acid, EPA+DHA, in RBCs) was significantly lower in smokers (Smokers: 3.19 ± 0.86%; Nonsmokers, 3.88 ± 1.05%, p = 0.001) and Hispanics (Hispanic 3.32 ± 0.93%; Non-Hispanic, 3.82 ± 1.03%, p = 0.006). DHA exhibited a significant inverse association with BP in both smokers and nonsmokers, while alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) exhibited a significant positive association with BP only in smokers. Multiple regression analyses showed that BMI, DHA, smoking status, and smoking status*ALA interaction significantly predicted SBP (p < 0.0001, R2 = 0.44) and DBP (p < 0.0001, R2 = 0.33), while ethnicity had no effect. The observed lower BP when DHA levels are high suggests a possible protective role of DHA on BP in normotensive smokers and nonsmokers. Additionally, the observed higher BP when ALA levels are high only in smokers suggests that ALA may influence the BP-lowering effects of chronic smoking.",The association of maternal polyunsaturated fatty acids during pregnancy with social competence and problem behaviours at 7 years of age: The MEFAB cohort.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31088621,"Prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and essential fatty acids",2019 05 15,"The prenatal exposure to maternal n-6 and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) might influence the development of social competence and internalizing and externalizing behaviours of the child, because of the numerous functions of PUFAs within the nervous system.",Production of d-glucuronic acid from myo-inositol using Escherichia coli whole-cell biocatalyst overexpressing a novel myo-inositol oxygenase from Thermothelomyces thermophile.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31088620,Enzyme and microbial technology,2019 05 15,"D-glucuronic acid (GlcUA) is an important intermediate with numerous applications in the food, cosmetics, and pharmaceutical industries. Its biological production routes which employ myo-inositol oxygenase (MIOX) as the key enzyme are attractive. In this study, five diverse MIOX-encoding genes, from Cryptococcus neoformans, Chaetomium thermophilum, Arabidopsis thaliana, Thermothelomyces thermophila, and Mus musculus were overexpressed in Escherichia coli, respectively. A novel MIOX from Thermothelomyces thermophila (TtMIOX) exhibited high specific activity, and efficiently converted myo-inositol to GlcUA. Meanwhile, the degradation of GlcUA was inhibited by inactivation of uxaC from the Escherichia coli genome. Finally, the BWΔuxaC whole-cell biocatalyst harboring TtMIOX resulted in the production of 106 g/L GlcUA within 12 h in a 1-L bioreactor, corresponding to a conversion of 91% and productivity of 8.83 g/L/h.

As one of the isoforms, MMP-1 breaks down collagen, and its activity is known to be important in wound healing. Its timely and adequate level of expression is pivotal because MMP-1 is also involved in the damage or aging of skins as well as in certain types of cancers. Thus, both assaying the MMP-1 activity and developing its inhibitors are of great importance. We here developed an in-house assay system that gave us the high degree of freedom in screening peptide inhibitors of MMP-1. The assay system utilized a circularly permutated fusion of β-lactamase and its inhibitory protein through an MMP-1-sensitive linker so that the activity of MMP-1 could be translated into that of β-lactamase. As a proof of concept, we applied the developed assay system to initial screens of MMP-1 inhibitors and successfully identified one lead peptide that inhibited the collagenase activity of the enzyme.",Functional exploration of Pseudoalteromonas atlantica as a source of hemicellulose-active enzymes: Evidence for a GH8 xylanase with unusual mode of action.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31088618,Enzyme and microbial technology,2019 05 15,"To address the need for efficient enzymes exhibiting novel activities towards cell wall polysaccharides, the bacterium Pseudoalteromonas atlantica was selected based on the presence of potential hemicellulases in its annotated genome. It was grown in the presence or not of hemicelluloses and the culture filtrates were screened towards 42 polysaccharides. P. atlantica showed appreciable diversity of enzymes active towards hemicelluloses from Monocot and Dicot origin, in agreement with its genome annotation.

To support effective use of ART and prevent spread of HIVDR, monitoring is essential.AimWe piloted a surveillance system for transmitted HIVDR to assess the feasibility of implementation at the European level.MethodAll 31 countries in the European Union and European Economic Area were invited to retrospectively submit data on individuals newly diagnosed with HIV in 2015 who were tested for antiviral susceptibility before ART, either as case-based or as aggregate data. We used the Stanford HIV database algorithm to translate genetic sequences into levels of drug resistance.ResultsNine countries participated, with six reporting case-based data on 1,680 individuals and four reporting aggregated data on 1,402 cases. Sequence data were available for 1,417 cases: 14.5% of individuals (n = 244) showed resistance to at least one antiretroviral drug. In case-based surveillance, the highest levels of transmitted HIVDR were observed for non-nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) with resistance detected in 8.6% (n = 145), followed by resistance to nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) (5.1%; n = 85) and protease inhibitors (2.0%; n = 34).ConclusionWe conclude that standard reporting of HIVDR data was feasible in the participating countries. Legal barriers for data sharing, consensus on definitions and standardisation of interpretation algorithms should be clarified in the process of enhancing European-wide HIV surveillance with drug resistance information.","Contact tracing following measles exposure on three international flights, Germany, 2017.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31088599,Euro surveillance : bulletin Europeen sur les maladies transmissibles = European communicable disease bulletin,2019 06 10,"When a person with contagious measles has travelled by aircraft, European guidelines recommend contact tracing of passengers and crew within 5 days of exposure for post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), and within 12 days of exposure for informing passengers and crew, in order to prevent further transmissions. To be effective, contact tracing requires prompt diagnosis, immediate notification of public health authorities and rapid availability of passenger contact data. We report two events of contact tracing initiated in Germany after two individuals with measles travelled on three international flights. In one event, contact tracing was initiated late because laboratory confirmation of a clinically diagnosed measles case was awaited unnecessarily. Accessing passenger contact data was difficult in both events because of data protection issues with the airline which was not based in Germany. In both events, passengers were not reached in time to provide PEP, and one event resulted in at least two secondary measles cases. As all passengers were reached before the incubation period ended, tertiary cases were most probably prevented. Public health authorities and the transport sector must collaborate to resolve competing legal regulations for infection prevention and data protection, to simplify and accelerate identification of air travellers exposed to communicable diseases.","A cluster analysis of serious adverse event reports after human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination in Danish girls and young women, September 2009 to August 2017.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31088598,Euro surveillance : bulletin Europeen sur les maladies transmissibles = European communicable disease bulletin,2019 06 10,"BackgroundSuspected adverse events (AE) after human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines include postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) and symptoms including headache and orthostatic intolerance.AimWe aimed to identify phenotypes of AEs after HPV vaccination, defined as patterns of AE terms (signs, symptoms, diagnoses), and to evaluate if identified phenotypes reflected previously suspected symptomatology or heightened public concerns over HPV vaccine safety since 1 January 2015.MethodsWe conducted a retrospective observational study using latent class cluster analysis of all serious AE reports (n = 963) reported by females residing in Denmark between September 2009 and August 2017. Resulting clusters were characterised according to AE terms associated with POTS, CFS and CRPS before (September 2009-December 2014) and during (January 2015-August 2017) a time of heightened media activity regarding HPV vaccines.ResultsFour clusters of AE reports were distinguished. The most common symptoms were fatigue, dizziness and headache but their frequency varied among clusters. The majority of reports in one cluster were submitted during a period of heightened media activity, including an anomalous spike in submissions in December 2015; a high proportion of these reports included the symptoms cognitive disorder (78%), abdominal pain (77%), dysuria (60%) and sleep disorder (60%).ConclusionsNon-specific symptoms including headache, fatigue and dizziness feature prominently in serious AE reports from females in Denmark.

Objective: A Performance Tested MethodSM study was conducted to validate Polyskope 1.0 for inclusivity and exclusivity as well as a matrix comparison study. Method: This assay was evaluated in an unpaired independent validation study compared with reference methods according to AOAC INTERNATIONAL validation guidelines. Polyskope 1.0 evaluated raw ground beef (25 g), deli turkey (25 g), baby spinach (25 g), and stainless-steel environmental surface sponges (4 × 4 in. test area) after inoculation with a suspension of the three target microorganisms. All matrices were compared with appropriate reference methods from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Bacteriological Analytical Manual, U.S. Department of Agriculture Food Safety and Inspection Service Microbiology Laboratory Guidebook, or International Organization for Standardization standards. Results: Polyskope 1.0 demonstrated no statistically significant differences between candidate and reference method results or between presumptive and confirmed results for three food matrices and one environmental surface. Results from inclusivity and exclusivity evaluations indicated the test method can accurately detect the target analytes and excluded all nontarget organisms. No differences were observed with the stability or lot-to-lot evaluations. Polyskope 1.0 demonstrated robustness by remaining unaffected by small variations in method parameters, which had no statistically significant effect on the results for all eight variations. Conclusions and Highlights: Polyskope 1.0 was shown to be a specific, highly accurate, and robust method for the detection of Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella species, non-O157 STECs, and E. coli O157 across four matrices.",Surfactant-Assisted Emulsification and Surfactant-Based Dispersive Liquid-Liquid Microextraction Method for Determination of Cu(II) in Food and Water Samples by Flame Atomic Absorption Spectrometry.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31088596,Journal of AOAC International,2019 05 15,"Background: Copper (Cu) is an essential metal for humans at certain concentrations. However, it can be toxic at higher concentrations. Therefore, determination of Cu content of foodstuff is important. Objective: The aim of the study was to develop a simple, economical, and environmentally friendly surfactant-mediated extraction method for the determination of Cu using surfactants and flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS). Methods: A nonionic surfactant-assisted emulsification and surfactant-based dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction method was developed for the separation, preconcentration, and determination of Cu by FAAS. Triton X-15 nonionic surfactant, which is insoluble in water, was used as an extractive agent. Triton X-114 (TX-114) nonionic water-soluble surfactant was used as a disperser solvent. Dithizone was used as a complexing agent for complexation of Cu(II) at pH 4. Results: The detection and quantitation limits of the method were determined as 1.61 and 3.82 μg/L, respectively. The preconcentration factor was obtained as 50. Relative SD based on 10 replicates was obtained as 3.7%. Accuracy of the developed method was proved using certified standard reference materials. Cu(II) content of edible mushroom samples was determined between 12 and 19 μg/g. Recoveries were obtained between 96 and 101%. Conclusions: The developed surfactant-assisted emulsification and surfactant-based dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction method has represented the wide linear ranges, low detection limit, and high preconcentration factor for Cu ions. Highlights: TX-114 surfactant was used as both sticking agent and disperser solvent. The method does not require expert personnel and high operational costs.

Invalid analytical methods lead to inaccurate data and misinterpretation of results in the pharmaceutical, food, and medical sciences. There are a number of guidelines issued on validation by international organizations. Some parameters have been proposed to evaluate the validity of an analytical method. They are accurate and comprehensive; however, proposing new criteria can help analysts to detect invalid methods. Objective: In this study, new criteria are proposed based on upper and lower limits of linear range and calculated responses by calibration curve equation. Methods: Further research on 150 reported analytical methods (non-separation-based and separation-based techniques) for chemicals and pharmaceuticals (organic and inorganic compounds) in scientific papers revealed that employing the coefficient of determination (R²) alone could lead analysts to an inaccurate linear range and method validation, and consequently, results showed that only 55% of these methods count as valid approaches. Conclusions: The established criteria based on the calibration curve equation and linear range appear to be applicable and suitable for validity evaluation of analytical methods.",Ultrasound-Enhanced Subcritical Fluid Extraction of Essential Oil from Nymphaea alba var and Its Antioxidant Activity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31088594,Journal of AOAC International,2019 05 15,"Background: The essential oil content of the water lily is extremely low; thus, finding a new method that can extract essential oil from water lilies with a high extraction rate and no residual organic solvents is essential. Objective: The optimal processing conditions for the ultrasound-enhanced subcritical fluid extraction of essential oil from Nymphaea alba var (red water lily) and the antioxidant activity of the essential oil in vitro are investigated to provide theoretical bases for identification and development.

Here, we report that gluconate inhibits neonatal seizure by inhibiting CLC-3 chloride channels. We detect a voltage-dependent outward rectifying Cl- current mediated by CLC-3 Cl- channels in early developing brains but not adult mouse brains. Blocking CLC-3 Cl- channels by gluconate inhibits seizure activity both in neonatal brain slices and in neonatal animals with in vivo EEG recordings. Consistently, neonatal neurons of CLC-3 knockout mice lack the outward rectifying Cl- current and show reduced epileptiform activity upon stimulation. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that activation of CLC-3 Cl- channels alters intracellular Cl- homeostasis and enhances GABA excitatory activity. Our studies suggest that gluconate can suppress neonatal seizure activities through inhibiting CLC-3 Cl- channels in developing brains.",Biomarkers of oxidative stress in saliva in pigs: analytical validation and changes in lactation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31088564,BMC veterinary research,2019 05 22,"Biomarkers of oxidative stress in pigs have been measured in serum/plasma samples.

ESBL-E dissemination was first due to outbreaks in hospital settings which led to the implementation of systematic fecal carriage screening to improve hygiene procedures by contact precautions. ESBLs have since spread in the community, and the relevance of contact precautions is questioned. ESBL-E dissemination led to an overuse of carbapenems triggering the emergence of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae. Empirical antimicrobial therapy based on ESBL-E fecal carriage has been proposed but is debated as it could increase the consumption of carbapenems among ESBL-E carriers without any clinical benefit. Finally, selective decontamination among ESBL-E fecal carriers is evoked to decrease the risk for subsequent ESBL-E infection, but its efficacy remains debated.

One of the key research fields involves the separation and detection of circulating tumor cells (CTC) because of their suggested important role in early cancer diagnosis and prognosis, namely, providing easy access by a liquid biopsy from blood to identify metastatic cells before clinically detectable metastasis occurs and to study the molecular and genetic profile of these metastatic cells. Provided the opportunity to further progress the development of technology for treating cancer, several CTC technologies have been proposed in recent years by various research groups and companies. Despite their potential role in cancer healthcare, CTC methods are currently mainly used for research purposes, and only a few methods have been accepted for clinical application because of the difficulties caused by CTC heterogeneity, CTC separation from the blood, and a lack of thorough clinical validation. Therefore, the standardization and clinical application of various developed CTC technologies remain important subsequent necessary steps. Because of their suggested future clinical benefits, we focus on describing technologies using whole blood samples without any pretreatment and discuss their advantages, use, and significance. Technologies using whole blood samples utilize size-based, immunoaffinity-based, and density-based methods or combinations of these methods as well as positive and negative enrichment during separation. Although current CTC technologies have not been truly implemented yet, they possess high potential as future clinical diagnostic techniques for the individualized therapy of patients with cancer. Thus, a detailed discussion of the clinical suitability of these new advanced technologies could help prepare clinicians for the future and can be a foundation for technologies that would be used to eliminate CTCs in vivo.",Impact of khat price increases on consumption behavior - price elasticity analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31088478,"Substance abuse treatment, prevention, and policy",2019 05 22,"The long border of Saudi Arabia with Yemen is the primary route for khat entry to the Kingdom.

These macrophages serve as a promising target for treatment of cancer due to their roles in promoting cancer progression and simultaneous immunosuppression. The TAM receptors (Tyro3, Axl and MerTK) are promising therapeutic targets on tumor-associated macrophages. The TAM receptors are a family of receptor tyrosine kinases with shared ligands Gas6 and Protein S that skew macrophage polarization towards a pro-tumor M2-like phenotype. In macrophages, the TAM receptors also promote apoptotic cell clearance, a tumor-promoting process called efferocytosis. The TAM receptors bind the ""eat-me"" signal phosphatidylserine on apoptotic cell membranes using Gas6 and Protein S as bridging ligands. Post-efferocytosis, macrophages are further polarized to a pro-tumor M2-like phenotype and secrete increased levels of immunosuppressive cytokines. Since M2 polarization and efferocytosis are tumor-promoting processes, the TAM receptors on macrophages serve as exciting targets for cancer therapy. Current TAM receptor-directed therapies in preclinical development and clinical trials may have anti-cancer effects though impacting macrophage phenotype and function in addition to the cancer cells.",Periodic fever syndromes: beyond the single gene paradigm.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31088470,Pediatric rheumatology online journal,2019 05 22,"Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is the most common monogenic autoinflammatory disease in Canada and is characterized by a clinical syndrome of episodic inflammatory symptoms. Traditionally, the disease is defined by autosomal recessive inheritance of MEFV gene variants, yet FMF also not uncommonly manifests in individuals with only one identified disease-associated allele. Increasing availability and affordability of gene sequencing has led to the identification of multiple MEFV variants; however, they are often of unknown clinical significance. Variants in other genes affecting overlapping or distinct inflammatory signaling pathways - together with gene-environment interactions including epigenetic modulation - likely underlie the significant genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity seen among patients with this disease. We review recent evidence of the expanding spectrum of FMF genotype and phenotype and suggest that current drug funding schemes restricting biologic agents to patients with homozygous mutations have not kept pace with our biological understanding of the disease.","High-frequency ultrasound, computed tomography and computed tomography arthrography of the cranial cruciate ligament, menisci and cranial meniscotibial ligaments in 10 radiographically normal canine cadaver stifles.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31088469,BMC veterinary research,2019 05 22,"Bilateral non-traumatic cranial cruciate disease is frequently seen in originally unilateral cruciate pathology. Untreated cranial cruciate ligament disease and concurrent meniscal lesions cause progressive osteoarthritis and pain of the stifle joint. Early presurgical diagnosis is important, but remains difficult. The purpose of this ex vivo study was (1) to describe the ultrasonographic appearance of the canine cranial cruciate ligament (CrCrL), menisci and meniscal ligaments using a high-frequency linear transducer, (2) to determine the length of the CrCrL seen on ultrasonography (US) and (3) to describe and compare the appearance of the CrCrL, menisci and meniscal ligaments on US, computed tomography (CT) and computed tomography arthrography (CTA)."

Syndromic data streams are fed into detection algorithms, which produce statistical alarms highlighting potential activity of public health importance. All alarms must be assessed to confirm whether they are of public health importance. In England, approximately 100 alarms are generated daily and, although their analysis is formalised through a risk assessment process, the process requires notable time, training, and maintenance of an expertise base to determine which alarms are of public health importance. The process is made more complicated by the observation that only 0.1% of statistical alarms are deemed to be of public health importance. Therefore, the aims of this study were to evaluate machine learning as a tool for computer-assisted human decision-making when assessing statistical alarms.",Exploring medically-related Canadian summer student research programs: a National Cross-sectional Survey Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31088445,BMC medical education,2019 05 22,"Summer student research programs (SSRPs) serve to generate student interest in research and a clinician-scientist career path.

Moreover, existential suffering lacks definition and no consensus exists on how to evaluate and manage it. This study explores the perspectives of care professionals and volunteers from a ""right-to-die organization"" on existential suffering as a motive for assisted suicide requests."
