Biofilms that colonise the so-called 'plastisphere' could also be a reservoir for faecal indicator organisms (FIOs), such as Escherichia coli, or pathogenic bacteria such as species of Vibrio. Therefore, the aim of this study was to map the spatial distribution of beach-cast plastic resin pellets (nurdles) at five public bathing beaches, and quantify their colonisation by E. coli and Vibrio spp. Nurdles were heterogeneously distributed along the high tide mark at all five beaches, and each beach contained nurdles that were colonised by E. coli and Vibrio spp. Knowledge of E. coli colonisation and persistence on nurdles should now be used to inform coastal managers about the additional risks associated with plastic debris.","Seasonal dynamics of the coastal bacterioplankton at intensive fish-farming areas of the Yellow Sea, China revealed by high-throughput sequencing.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30686439,Marine pollution bulletin,2019 03 18,"Marine aquaculture areas are facing stressed environmental challenges, especially the degradation of coastal ecosystems. Here a coordinated time-series study was used to investigate the coastal bacterioplankton biodiversity dynamics of the Yellow Sea, China. Bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed a temporal pattern of decreasing of diversity in summer. Functional prediction indicated that metabolic pathways related to the adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-binding cassette transporters and other membrane transporters were significantly enriched in May, while the genetic information processing category was most abundant in March. The May microbiomes showed most significant positive correlation with phosphate concentration, while the August and November microbiomes correlated with temperature and chemical oxygen demand (COD) most, and the March microbiomes showed significant correlation with Cu2+ level, pH and salinity. The correlations between representative bacteria and environmental parameters revealed in this study may provide insights into the potential influences of human aquaculture activities, on the biodiversity of coastal bacterioplankton.",Mapping the environmental risk assessment of marinas on water quality: The Atlas of the Spanish coast.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30686438,Marine pollution bulletin,2019 03 18,"Recreational sailing sector has an impact on water quality in marinas. This study proposes a standard procedure to assess the environmental risk of marinas on water quality. Risk is assessed through integrating environmental pressures, environmental conditions and societal responses (i.e. the Pressure-State-Response model). Pressures are estimated considering the main driving forces: navigation, port, dredging and external activities. State is estimated through combining the susceptibility, the ecological value and naturalness. Response is estimated through environmental management instruments and adopted measures. Managers and authorities can hierarchically classify marinas from a multi-scale spatial framework. This tool is particularly powerful for generating local, regional or national atlases to prioritize environmental planning actions. The method is applied to 320 marinas along the Spanish coast. This implementation confirms the usefulness, versatility and adaptability of this procedure as a tool for the environmental management of marinas.",Differential toxicity of functionalized polystyrene microplastics to clams (Meretrix meretrix) at three key development stages of life history.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30686437,Marine pollution bulletin,2019 03 18,"Little knowledge is available on impact of microplastics (MPs) on the bivalve larvae at different developmental stages throughout their life history, especially for metamorphic stage. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the toxic responses of carboxylated (PS-COOH) and amino (PS-NH2) polystyrene MPs on the developing clam larvae at three key life stages, i.e., fertilized eggs, D-veliger larvae, and umbo larvae. PS-COOH and PS-NH2 significantly decreased the hatching rates by 5.79-39.5% and developmental rates by 4.78-7.86% of the clam larvae relative to the unexposed clam larvae. The toxicity of MPs followed the order: hatching stage > metamorphosis > D-veliger larvae stage, showing stage-dependent toxic effects. Moreover, PS-NH2 with a smaller hydrodynamic diameter showed a greater toxicity to the developing larvae compared to PS-COOH. Our study highlighted the stage-dependent toxic effects of MPs on the developing clam larvae, thus posing ecological risks to population succession of marine bivalves and aquatic ecosystems.",Occurrence of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in coral reef fish from the South China Sea.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30686436,Marine pollution bulletin,2019 03 11,"Little data are available on the bioaccumulation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in coral reef fish from the South China Sea (SCS). In this study, we collected 21 coral reef fish species from the Xisha and Nansha Islands in the SCS to investigate the occurrence of 16 US-EPA PAHs. The total PAH concentrations (ΣPAH) in the collected fish ranged from 12.79 to 409.28 ng/g dry weight (dw, Xisha Islands) and from 32.71 to 139.09 ng/g dw (Nansha Islands), respectively. The ΣPAH concentration of Scarus niger collected from the Xisha Islands (237.13 ng/g dw) was about twofold higher than that of Scarus niger collected from the Nansha Islands (139.09 ng/g dw). The dominant compounds were found to be 2-ring and 3-ring PAHs. Based on qualitative and quantitative analyses, the main PAH sources were found to be coal and biomass combustion (50.43%), petroleum sources (25.86%), and vehicular emissions (16.10%).",Pollution levels of banned and non-banned pesticides in surface sediments from the East China Sea.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30686435,Marine pollution bulletin,2019 03 11,"In this paper, 65 pesticides, including banned ones of DDTs, etc. and non-banned ones of iprobenfos, etc. have been detected in 31 surface sediment samples from the East China Sea (ECS) to study their pollution levels, sources, and risks. There were 8 banned pesticides (90-97%) and 10 non-banned pesticides (26-100%) presenting higher detection frequencies. For the 18 pesticides detected, their total contents ranged from 183.49 to 1363.77 ng/g dry weight (d.w.) and presented a seaward decreasing trend. Higher contents of banned pesticides were concentrated in the inner shelf close to Zhoushan Island. Iprobenfos, one of non-banned pesticides, showed the highest detection frequency (100%) and pollution level (79.14-1169.18 ng/g d.w.), indicating its continuous input in recent years. The pesticides concentrations in water calculated by the equilibrium partitioning (EqP) method were lower than the toxicological endpoint for tested aquatic invertebrates and fish, indicating ecological risks of these pesticides were at low levels.",Micro(nano)plastics: Unignorable vectors for organisms.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30686434,Marine pollution bulletin,2019 03 11,"Micro(nano)plastics, as emerging contaminants, have attracted worldwide attention. Nowadays, the environmental distribution, sources, and analysis methods and technologies of micro(nano)plastics have been well studied and recognized. Nevertheless, the role of micro(nano)plastic particles as vectors for attaching organisms is not fully understood. In this paper, the role of micro(nano)plastics as vectors, and their potential effects on the ecology are introduced. Micro(nano)plastics could 1) accelerate the diffusion of organisms in the environment, which may result in biological invasion; 2) increase the gene exchange between attached biofilm communities, causing the transfer of pathogenic and antibiotic resistance genes; 3) enhance the rate of energy, material and information flow in the environment. Accordingly, the role of microplastics as vectors for organisms should be further evaluated in the future research.",Origins of sediment organic matter and their contributions at three contrasting wetlands in a coastal semi-enclosed ecosystem.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30686433,Marine pollution bulletin,2019 03 11,"The origins of sediment organic matter (SOM) and their contributions were studied in three contrasting wetlands (mudflat, estuarine and mangrove) of Daya Bay, South China Sea. Lower sediment δ13C but higher δ15N values were observed in coastal wetland than in offshore water of the bay. Greater terrigenous organic matter (TOM) contribution to SOM was observed in lower tidal area in mudflat and estuarine wetland. Higher concentrations of total organic carbon and total nitrogen in the three wetlands, as well as lower sediment δ13C, were found in the wet season. Extremely lower sediment δ15N with higher seawater ammonia were observed in estuarine wetland than in mudflat and mangrove, which was caused by the input of 15N-depleted ammonia from petrochemical industrial wastewater. Mangrove contributed substantially to SOM, with a larger contribution in mangrove area than in non-mangrove area. The mean contribution of TOM to SOM was lower in mangrove than in mudflat.",A scalable dynamic characterisation approach for water quality management in semi-enclosed seas and archipelagos.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30686432,Marine pollution bulletin,2019 03 11,"In semi-enclosed seas, eutrophication may affect both the coastal waters and the whole sea. We develop and test a modelling approach that can account for nutrient loads from land as well as for influences and feedbacks on water quality across the scales of a whole semi-enclosed sea and its coastal zones. We test its applicability in the example cases of the Baltic Sea and one of its local archipelagos, the Archipelago Sea. For the Baltic Sea scale, model validation shows good representation of surface water quality dynamics and a generally moderate model performance for deeper waters. For the Archipelago Sea, management scenario simulations show that successful sea measures may have the most important effects on coastal water quality. This highlights the need to consistently account for whole-sea water-quality dynamics and management effects, in addition to effects of land drivers, in modelling for characterisation and management of local water quality.",Fatty acids and elemental composition as biomarkers of Octopus vulgaris populations: Does origin matter?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30686431,Marine pollution bulletin,2019 03 11,"The present study describes the novel use of fatty acids (FAs) and element profiles of Octopus vulgaris inhabiting three coastal areas in the W-Mediterranean Sea. These populations are exposed to different anthropogenic activities, and were compared at different geographical scales. The FA composition in the mantle of O. vulgaris exhibited significant differences in 22:6 n-3 (DHA) and 22:5 n-3 (EPA) among the sampled populations. The essential microelements Fe, Cu, Zn and Ni, and the non-essential microelements As, Sr, Al and Cd were the main contributors of variability among sampled octopus populations, with some notable differences among tissues. The variations in the FAs and elemental composition in octopus tissues were detected with other populations throughout the species distribution range, which might reflect differences in natural habitats and foraging strategies. Therefore, these may be considered biomarkers as a proxy to distinguish the origin of octopus specimens at different scales."

Initial environmental risk assessment was performed using exposure and hazard assessments. An integrated hydrodynamic and chemical fate model was used to predict HNS concentrations at harbors, taking into account local environmental conditions. To consider the worst case HNS spill accident, the spill amount of 10,000 tonnages, was used for this study. The results show that highly soluble HNS are fatal to marine organisms during the neap tide. The results were based on a hypothetical worst case HNS spill accident and, not any specific actual HNS spill accident. Nevertheless, the method and system developed in this study, which includes the physical/chemical properties of 158 priority HNS, can be readily used to perform an initial environmental risk assessment for future HNS spill accidents.",First bloom event of the small dinoflagellate Prorocentrum shikokuense in the Mediterranean Sea: cryptogenic or introduced?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30686419,Marine pollution bulletin,2019 03 11,"A bloom of putatively non-indigenous species (NIS) Prorocentrum shikokuense was detected for the first time in the Mediterranean Sea at the Brindisi harbor (Southern Adriatic Sea) on September 2016, in the context of EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive monitoring in the ports. This species is usually observed in the East China Sea and Japanese and Korean waters. In the Brindisi harbor this dinoflagellate reached the concentration 105 cell/L and represented from 30 to 50% of the total phytoplankton population. Besides this event, Prorocentrum shikokuense has not been found blooming until today in Mediterranean waters.

Due to these characteristics, its candidacy as a model organism to monitor both marine and brackish matrices was assessed. Marine sediments collected in a polluted area near the port of Ancona (Italy) were used as case study. Besides the chemical characterization of sediments, the larval development of F. enigmaticus was adopted as an assay for ecotoxicological assessment of sediments in addition to a regulatory bioassay battery with different organisms and endpoints. The quality of sediments was classified according to the Italian Ministerial Decree for sediment management (Ministerial Decree 173, 2016) by using the SEDI-QUAL-SOFT® (ver. 109.0) software developed by the Italian Environmental Protection Agency (ISPRA). The F. enigmaticus larval development assay showed a quite similar sensitivity to C. gigas larval development assays, indicating its potential use in a regulatory battery of bioassays.",Fungal communities in oil contaminated mangrove sediments - Who is in the mud?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30686417,Marine pollution bulletin,2019 03 11,"Mangroves are ecosystems located in tropical and subtropical regions of the world and are vital for coastal protection. Their unique characteristics make them hotspots for carbon cycling and biological diversity. Studies on isolated filamentous fungi and environmental and anthropogenic factors that influence sediments offer new understandings on how to preserve mangroves. Here we report on the filamentous fungi isolated from four mangroves. We correlated fungal community composition with sediment texture, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons concentration (oil pollution), pH, salinity, organic matter, total and thermotolerant coliforms (sewage pollution). In total we identified 34 genera and 97 species. The most polluted sites had highest species richness whereas the best preserved site showed the lowest species richness. Oil spill and sewage pollution were identified as the drivers of fungal community composition in the most polluted sites. We found very distinct fungal communities with no >5 species shared between any two mangrove sites.","Assessment of the organotin pollution in the coastal sediments of the Western Arabian Gulf, Saudi Arabia.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30686416,Marine pollution bulletin,2019 03 11,"Organotin compounds (OTCs) are persistent pollutants and are considered as chemicals of environmental concern. They enter the marine environment from the antifouling paints containing organotin compounds on the hulls of ships and boats. We report the results of a study conducted in 2015 on the level of butyltins (TBT, DBT, and MBT) and phenyltins (TPhT, DPhT, and MPhT) in the sediments collected from three fishing harbors (Jubail, Khobar, and Qatif) and a reference site (Half Moon Bay). The concentrations of OTCs in the sediments vary widely among the different sampling locations. Overall, the phenyltins contribute more than the butyltins and the order of the abundance is: MPhT > DPhT > MBT > DBT > TPhT. In most stations, the concentrations of MBT are higher than DBT. The sediments from Khobar and Qatif are moderately polluted, whereas those from the Jubail are ranked as highly polluted. The concentrations of TBT at all study sites are less than the detection limit, and hence, the environmental and ecotoxicological risks are low.",Quantity and spatial distribution of seafloor marine debris in the Moroccan Mediterranean Sea.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30686415,Marine pollution bulletin,2019 03 11,"This paper qualifies, quantifies and localizes seafloor marine debris (SMD) in the Moroccan portion of the Mediterranean Sea. Six scientific trawl surveys were conducted by the Moroccan Institute of Fisheries Research from 2012 to 2015 between Cape Spartel (5°W) and Saidia (2°W), during which a total of 497 kg of SMD has been collected. Statistical analysis show that the mean abundance differed between surveys, generally ranging from 26 ± 68 to 80 ± 133 kg/km2. A typology of SMD indicates that plastic represented 73% of the debris collected, followed by rubber (12%), textile (8%), metal (3%), glass (0.32%), and some unidentified materials (2.70%). Analysis of results shows that the abundance and the distribution of SMD were strongly influenced by the local anthropogenic activities and by rivers inputs. The movements and accumulations in the open sea were also shown to be influenced by the geomorphology and the hydrodynamics of the basin.","Microplastic contamination in surface waters in Guanabara Bay, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30686414,Marine pollution bulletin,2019 03 11,"Microplastics (MPs) are contaminants of environmental concern that represent a threat to marine systems. Here we report data on the abundance and characteristics of MPs collected from surface waters of the urban Guanabara Bay. Samples were collected, by horizontal trawling of a plankton net on two occasions (summer of 2016). The MPs were obtained from samples by sieving and particles were manually sorted with microscope. Characterization of MPs was accomplished by gravimetry and digital image processing (for quantification and morphology categorization), and chemical composition identified by infrared spectroscopy and elemental analyses. Total MPs ranged from 1.40 to 21.3 particles/m3, which places Guanabara Bay amongst the most contaminated coastal systems worldwide by microplastics. Polyethylene and polypropylene polymers ≤1 mm were the most abundant particles. Therefore, the occurrence of MPs in Guanabara Bay is relevant to understand ecological hazards of exposition to marine biota and merits further investigation.",Examining derelict pot impacts on harvest in a commercial blue crab Callinectes sapidus fishery.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30686413,Marine pollution bulletin,2019 03 11,"Pot fisheries occur worldwide with a significant proportion of the gear becoming derelict. Derelict pots induce detrimental ecological and economic impacts, and more recently were found to reduce blue crab harvests in the Chesapeake Bay commercial fishery. We simulated the presence of derelict pots near actively fished pots in seasonal field experiments to quantify the effect derelict pots have on blue crab harvest. Derelict pots reduced harvests by 30% during the summer, but not during the fall. Female blue crab capture rates were consistently lower when derelict pots were present; while capture rates of the less abundant males were not negatively affected by derelict pots. Variable responses to derelict pots may be due to seasonal differences in female and male blue crab behavior and movements. The costly effect that derelict pots have on harvest should be investigated in other pot fisheries to recognize the magnitude and mechanisms behind these impacts.",Calcium carbonate unit realignment under acidification: A potential compensatory mechanism in an edible estuarine oyster.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30686412,Marine pollution bulletin,2019 03 11,"Ocean acidification (OA) is well-known for impairing marine calcification; however, the end response of several essential species to this perturbation remains unknown. Decreased pH and saturation levels (Ω) of minerals under OA is projected to alter shell crystallography and thus to reduce shell mechanical properties. This study examined this hypothesis using a commercially important estuarine oyster Magallana hongkongensis. Although shell damage occurred on the outmost prismatic layer and the undying myostracum at decreased pH 7.6 and 7.3, the major foliated layer was relatively unharmed. Oysters maintained their shell hardness and stiffness through altered crystal unit orientation under pH 7.6 conditions. However, under the undersaturated conditions (ΩCal ~ 0.8) at pH 7.3, the realigned crystal units in foliated layer ultimately resulted in less stiff shells which indicated although estuarine oysters are mechanically resistant to unfavorable calcification conditions, extremely low pH condition is still a threat to this essential species.",Accumulation and distribution of marine debris on barrier islands across the northern Gulf of Mexico.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30686411,Marine pollution bulletin,2019 03 11,"Marine debris is an economic, environmental, human health, and aesthetic problem posing a complex challenge to communities around the globe. To better document this problem in the Gulf of Mexico we monitored the occurrence and accumulation rate of marine debris at twelve sites on nine barrier islands from North Padre Island, Texas to Santa Rosa, Florida. With this information we are investigating three specific questions: (1) what are the major types/sources of marine debris; (2) does debris deposition have seasonal oscillations; and (3) how does debris deposition change spatially? Several trends emerged; plastic composed 69-95% of debris; there was a significant increase in debris accumulation during the spring and summer seasons; accumulation rates were ten times greater in Texas than the other Gulf States throughout the year; and the amount of debris accumulating along the shoreline could be predicted with high confidence in areas with high freshwater influx."

Assessment is a fundamental component of education and driver of learning, yet little is known about methods used to assess dietetics trainees. The objective of this review is to evaluate the practices and outcomes of methods used to assess dietetics trainees. A systematic review of the literature was undertaken. MEDLINE, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature Plus, Embase, and the Education Resources Information Center databases were searched from inception until May 31, 2017, using key terms that identified studies reporting practices for the assessment of dietetics trainees. Abstract and title screening was completed by three independent reviewers followed by full-text screening using the eligibility criteria. Quantitative and qualitative data were extracted. Study outcomes were evaluated using Miller's Pyramid, Kirkpatrick's Hierarchy, and the principles of programmatic assessment. Thirty-seven studies were identified. Assessments targeted all levels of Miller's Pyramid with the does level being the most prevalent (n=23). Most studies focussed on evaluating Level 1 (participation) (n=16) and Level 2b (n=16) (knowledge and skills) of Kirkpatrick's Hierarchy. Studies described single assessment instruments that focussed on instrument validity and reliability. Few studies considered a program of assessment or the role of expert judgment. Six themes were identified from qualitative data: (1) assessment for learning and professional development, (2) assessment requires motivated and skilled assessors, (3) trainees value authentic and global assessment, (4) assessment is evolving and context-sensitive, (5) poor assessment has negative implications, and (6) assessment evokes an emotional response. Studies focused on the development and evaluation of single quantitative-based instruments applied in isolation, with low-level outcomes sought. There is room to improve practices and design programs of assessment that combine quantitative and qualitative data for meaningful trainee feedback and credible assessment decisions. Comprehensive evaluation of assessment practices is required and must consider the contribution to improved health outcomes in all practice settings.",Postmortem Imaging: An Update.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30686372,"Seminars in ultrasound, CT, and MR",2019 05 15,"Postmortem imaging is a fascinating field of forensic radiology that has seen extraordinary growth in the last 10 years. Indeed, if autopsy represents the sole reliable method of determining the definitive cause of death, imaging may provide an efficient guide to supplement conventional autopsy. This is particularly true because of several techniques that are currently available, such as postmortem computed tomography, multiphase postmortem computed tomography angiography, and postmortem magnetic resonance imaging. In this review, we explore the newer imaging techniques in forensic radiology.",Role of Postmortem CT in the Forensic Evaluation of Hemopericardium.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30686371,"Seminars in ultrasound, CT, and MR",2019 05 15,"Hemopericardium (HP) is defined as the accumulation of blood in the pericardial sack. In a clinical setting, prompt identification of the presence of HP is of huge importance, because HP can result in pericardial tamponade. While echocardiography remains the most appropriate method for the evaluation of pericardial effusions in the clinical setting, postmortem imaging computed tomography (PMCT) is a valuable instrument for detecting the presence of HP and in evaluating its significance in causing mechanical impairment of cardiac activity and finally death. In this article, the actual knowledge on PMCT imaging findings related to HP are reported, with particular attention to the assessment of its significance with relation to the forensic diagnosis of the cause of death. According to the present work, the diagnosis of pericardial tamponade due to HP might be considered one of the critical fields of investigation where classical autopsy may fail and where PMCT imaging may offer its most important aids.",Virtopsy and Living Individuals Evaluation Using Computed Tomography in Forensic Diagnostic Imaging.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30686370,"Seminars in ultrasound, CT, and MR",2019 05 15,"The applications of forensic radiology involve both Virtopsy both studies on living people - to demonstrate bone age, search for foreign bodies, such as voluntary injection of drug ovules or surgical sponges accidentally forgotten, to assess gunshot wounds, to evaluate injuries by road accidents, and cases of violence or abuse (both in adults and in children). Computed tomography is the most used imaging tool used in forensic pathology and its indications are mainly focused on cases of unnatural deaths or when a crime is suspected. It is preferred over the standard autopsy in selected cases, such as in putrefied, carbonized or badly damaged bodies; or as a preliminary evaluation in mass disasters.","A Practical Guide to Virtual Autopsy: Why, When and How.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30686369,"Seminars in ultrasound, CT, and MR",2019 05 15,"Postmortem imaging is considered a routine investigative modality in many forensic institutions worldwide. Because of its ability to provide a quick and complete documentation of skeletal system and major parenchymal alterations, postmortem computed tomography (PMCT) is the imaging technique most frequently applied in postmortem forensic investigations. Also postmortem magnetic resonance has been implemented in postmortem setting, but its use is mostly limited to focused analysis (eg, study of the heart and brain). PMCT presents some limits in investigating ""natural"" deaths, particularly related to its poor ability in differentiating soft tissue interfaces and in depicting vascular lesions. For this reason, PMCT angiography has been introduced. A major limitation of these postmortem imaging techniques is the absence of body samples for histopathologic, toxicologic, or microbiological analysis. This limit has been overcome by the introduction of postmortem percutaneous biopsies. The aim of this review is to provide a practical guide for virtual autopsy, with the intent of facilitating standardization and augmenting its quality. In particular, the indications of virtual autopsy as well protocols in PMCT examinations and its ancillary techniques will be discussed. Finally, the workflow of a typical virtual autopsy and its main steps will be described.",Role of Imaging in the Assessment of Age Estimation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30686368,"Seminars in ultrasound, CT, and MR",2019 05 15,"Age assessment by skeletal age estimation of unknown individuals is of paramount importance in forensic science, both for assessing imputability (if the author of a crime is old enough to be tried and judged), both in case of unaccompanied minors, or whether refugees and asylum seekers are adults or juveniles, which implies different legal issues and procedures. The aim of this article is to review the age estimation methods used in forensic practice.",Radiology of Mummies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30686367,"Seminars in ultrasound, CT, and MR",2019 05 15,"In the past, autoptic examinations were usually performed for research. This type of examination, for obvious reasons, did not appeal to paleopathologists as these procedures potentially damaged the finds destined to musealization. Since the discovery of X-ray, radiology has been used to study mummies as a noninvasive technique. The radiology of mummies allows us to discover pathologies, to elaborate on the type of ritual mummification for the artificial embalming, to comprehend the diagenetic process that guaranteed a natural mummification, or to conclude anthropological identification. We present a review on the latest studies on mummies that have shown that the radiological approach has been essential to conduct research.",Occupational Lung Diseases: Underreported Diagnosis in Radiological Practice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30686366,"Seminars in ultrasound, CT, and MR",2019 05 15,"Underreporting of occupational lung diseases is a widespread problem in clinical practice. In Europe there is not a common regulation even for the recognition of occupational cancers. Furthermore epidemiologic data on occupational interstitial lung diseases, in general, is limited by no standardized diagnostic criteria, varied physician awareness and training, limitations inherent to the various data sources, and the long latency period. Therefore, to optimize the management of the patient with occupational pathology, the collaboration and skills of the multidisciplinary at the service of the patient, play a fundamental role. In particular, radiologists should give substance to a clinical suspicion on an anamnestic basis and at the same time should recognize patterns of illness that can lead to the emergence of stories of misunderstood exposures. This article aims to provide an overview of the main occupational lung diseases with attention to diagnostic possibilities of the different imaging techniques. The issue of the radiological error is investigated, providing tools to minimize it in the daily practice.",Gunshot Wounds: Ballistics and Imaging Findings.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30686364,"Seminars in ultrasound, CT, and MR",2019 05 15,"Ballistic traumas are defined by a projectile entering the body. Such projectiles include bullets, birdshot, and metal fragments from the covering or the contents of an explosive device. They frequently cause severe wounds characterized by a range of clinical pictures and a large spectrum of concomitant wounds. The major aims of imaging are to define the path of the projectile or projectiles, to evaluate which tissues have been injured, to estimate the severity of injury, and to determine what additional studies are needed. A routine radiograph is performed in patients with gunshot wounds. The diagnostic approach has been changed by the use of multidetector row computed tomography (MDCT) due to its technical developments particularly faster data acquisition and advanced image reconstructions. In the evaluation of patients with gunshot injuries, MDCT is considered the method of choice to identify hemorrhage, bullet, bone fragments, air, hemothorax, nerve lesions, musculoskeletal lesions, and vessel injuries. Moreover, MDCT technology and multiplanar reformation postprocessing allow meticulous trajectory analysis that potentially benefits the clinical outcomes of patients aiding time-saving triage and correct image-based diagnosis of organ and vessel damage. Familiarity of ballistics and forensic sciences will therefore help the radiologist in assessment and localization of the damage caused by projectiles.",Imaging of Violence Against the Elderly and the Women.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30686363,"Seminars in ultrasound, CT, and MR",2019 05 15,"Emergency department assessment is a critical opportunity to identify elder abuse and violence against women, which represent a growing problem, requiring the attention of health care systems. Elder abuse is most frequently perpetrated by family members because of the higher levels of stress, burnout, and financial problems affecting the caregivers that can even lead to deadly consequences. Intimate partner violence is defined as physical, sexual, or psychological harm caused to another by a current or former partner or spouse, and can range from a single acute hit to chronic battering, varying in frequency and severity. Radiologists have a critical role in detecting those injury findings suggestive of abuse and violence. When appropriate, additional information about the social circumstances in which an injury took place, linked with imaging findings, may also be helpful in diagnosing abuse. The purpose of this article is to highlight the role of diagnostic imaging in the detection of lesions compatible with domestic abuse in elderly patients and women, and to allow the recognition of the alterations most frequently associated with this type of violence."

In the first, xylose reductase gene GRE3 was fused with two parts of the CCW12 gene, the N-terminal one coding for the secretion signal sequence, and the C-terminal coding for the glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchoring signal. Transformed cells synthesized xylose reductase and incorporated it in the cell wall through the remnant of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor. The other construct was prepared by fusing the GRE3 with the PIR4 gene coding for one of the proteins of the Pir-family containing the characteristic N-terminal repetitive sequence that anchors Pir proteins to β-1,3-glucan. In this way xylose reductase was covalently attached to glucan through its N-terminus. For the expression of the constructs either the GAL1, or the PHO5 promoters have been used. Both strains displayed active xylose reductases and their enzyme properties were compared with the control enzyme bearing the secretion signal sequence but no anchoring signals, thus secreted into the medium. The enzyme displayed through the N-terminal fusion with PIR4 had higher affinity for xylose than the other construct, but they both expressed somewhat lower affinity than the control enzyme. Similarly, the Km values for NADPH of both immobilized enzymes were somewhat higher than the Km of the control XR. Both displayed enzymes, especially the one fused with Pir4, had higher thermal and pH stability than the control, while other enzymatic properties were not significantly impaired by surface immobilization.",An improved enzyme nanoparticles based amperometric pyruvate biosensor for detection of pyruvate in serum.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30686348,Enzyme and microbial technology,2019 04 03,"The nanoparticles of commercially available pyruvate oxidase (POx) from Aerococcus species were prepared by desolvation method, which were then characterized and covalently immobilized onto gold electrode (AuE) to construct an improved model of amperometric pyruvate biosensor. The POxNPs/Au electrode was analyzed morphologically by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). On the other hand, cyclic voltammetry studies (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) helped in deciphering the electrochemical properties of the electrode at different stages of construction. The biosensor showed optimum response within 7.5 s, at a potential of 0.28 V, pH 5.5 and 35 °C. A linear relationship was observed between biosensor response i.e. current (μA) and pyruvate concentration in the range, 0.01 μM - 5000 μM, with a lower detection limit of 0.67 μM. The analytical recovery of added pyruvate in sera was 99.0% and 99.5% within and between batch coefficient of variation (CV) were 0.045% and 0.040% respectively. The working electrode displayed an excellent correlation coefficient (R2 = 0.99%) between levels of pyruvate in sera, as detected by the standard spectrophotometric method and the present biosensor. The biosensor was utilized for detection of total pyruvate level in sera of apparently healthy individuals and patients suffering from cardiogenic stress, more specifically cardiac failure.

Saturation mutagenesis was used to generate focused libraries at 7 active site residues in the vicinity of the heme cofactor, and the libraries were screened for activity towards 2,6-dichlorophenol. Mutants N193 L and H169 L were found to show 7-8 fold enhanced kcat/KM towards DCP, and replacements at Val205 and Ala209 also showed enhanced activity towards alkali Kraft lignin. Residues near the predicted Mn(II) binding site were also investigated by site-directed mutagenesis, and mutants S223 N and H127R showed 4-7-fold increased kcat/KM for Mn(II) oxidation. Mutant F128R also showed enhanced thermostability, compared to wild-type Dyp1B.

This paper is aimed to simplify the strategy of removing epitope tags from target proteins with HRV 3C protease. Fusion proteins composed of a xylanase from Bacillus sp. HBP8 (xylHB) and double tags (MBP/Nus and 6×His, with an HRV 3C protease recognition site between them) were applied as substrates. To perform the cleavage and purification, strains expressing HRV 3C protease and the substrates were mixed before (co-fermentation method) or after (post-fermentation method) inducing with IPTG, followed by cell disruption and incubation at 4℃, overnight for cleavage. The soluble cytoplasmic fraction was added to Ni-NTA resin to recover the cleaved target protein. Because the process was carried out in the cell lysate, it was named as cell lysate purification system based on HRV 3C protease (CLP3C). Our data indicated small number of cells expressing HRV 3C protease was enough to remove the fusion tags efficiently with both co-fermentation and post-fermentation methods. More importantly, the tags were cleaved precisely with no obvious non-specific degradation to the target protein. Hence, active xylanase was recovered easily with this strategy.",A mechanized urease activity assay.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30686345,Enzyme and microbial technology,2019 04 03,"Two fully mechanized flow analysis systems for urease activity assays have been developed, characterized and compared. Both of them are based on almost the same compact system of solenoid micropumps and microvalves controlled and actuated by highly effective, low-power and economic Arduino microcontroller. For photometric detection of ammonia formed in the course of enzymatic hydrolysis of urea, the Berthelot method and the Nessler reaction have been examined. For both these detection schemes very simple dedicated optoelectronic flow-through detectors made of paired light emitting diodes have been developed. In both systems single enzyme assay lasting a few minutes allows determination of urease in activity range 0.02-5.3 U mL-1 with detection limit 0.02 U mL-1 and in 1.3-5.3 U mL-1 range with 0.75 U mL-1 detection limit for Nessler reaction and Berthelot method based systems, respectively. When compared with mechanized Berthelot method, the bioanalytical system based on Nessler reaction offers higher sensitivity, lower detection/determination limits, better selectivity and lower cost of the assay. It has been demonstrated that the developed bioanalytical flow systems could be useful for urease determination in complex biological matrix like plant extracts and media for microbial cultures as well as for inhibitive determination of heavy metals at sub-ppm levels.",Inability of conventional imaging findings to predict response to laparoscopic release of the median arcuate ligament in patients with celiac artery compression.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30686339,Journal of vascular surgery,2019 04 22,The objective of this study was to identify duplex ultrasound (DUS) or computed tomography angiography (CTA) imaging findings that can predict clinical response to laparoscopic release of the median arcuate ligament (MAL) in patients with celiac artery compression.,Occult type I or III endoleaks are a common cause of failure of type II endoleak treatment after endovascular aortic repair.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30686338,Journal of vascular surgery,2019 04 22,"Most type II endoleaks have a benign natural history, but 6% to 8% are associated with sac enlargement and respond poorly to treatment.

In the operating room (OR), effective communication between teams is essential, especially during crisis situations where patient safety can be in acute danger. An often-neglected skillset in educational curriculums is challenging authority. This narrative synthesis aims to explore the literature on challenging authority in the OR environment. A systematic search of Medline, EBM reviews and PsycINFO was conducted using terms related to challenging authority, speaking up, communication, patient safety, gradients and hierarchy. The initial search identified 4822 publications, out of which 31 studies were included. The data synthesis of the included studies was grouped into three distinct categories following a meta-aggregative approach: discussion and review articles, observational or qualitative studies, and studies identifying the role of specific barriers or investigating the effect of educational interventions. Themes emerging from expert beliefs, what reality tells us and what we test are consistent. Hierarchy, organisational culture and education are the most frequently observed and tested themes. Simulation research has been successful in eliciting and confirming the role of specific barriers to speaking up. Barriers and enablers are largely modifiable within institutions however, education regarding the importance of speaking up will need to accompany these modifications for any significant changes to occur.","South African Paediatric Surgical Outcomes Study: a 14-day prospective, observational cohort study of paediatric surgical patients.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30686308,British journal of anaesthesia,2019 04 03,"Children comprise a large proportion of the population in sub-Saharan Africa.

The property of cancerous cells to affect almost any part of the body categorizes cancer to many anatomic and molecular subtypes, each requiring particular therapeutic intervention. As several modalities are hindered in a variety of cancers and as the cancer cells accrue varied types of oncogenic mutations during their progression the most likely benefit will be obtained by combination of therapeutic agents that might address the diverse hallmarks of cancer. Natural compounds are the backbone of cancer therapeutics owing to their property of affecting the DNA impairment and restoration mechanisms and also the gene expression modulated via several epigenetic molecular mechanisms. Bioactive peptides isolated from flora and fauna have transformed the arena of antitumour therapy and prompt progresses in preclinical studies are promising. The difficulties in creating ACP rests in improving its delivery to tumour site and it also must maintain a low toxicity profile. The substantial production costs, low selectivity and proteolytic stability of some ACP are some of the factors hindering the progress of peptide drug development. Recently, several publications have tried to edify the field with the idea of using peptides as adjuvants with established drugs for antineoplastic use. This review focuses on peptides from natural sources that precisely target tumour cells and subsequently serve as anticancer agents that are less toxic to normal tissues.",Resveratrol and Its Analogues: Recent Advances in Structural Modification and Bioactivity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30686253,Mini reviews in medicinal chemistry,2019 01 28,"Resveratrol is a non-flavonoid polyphenol compound containing terpenoid structure. It has been intensively studied because of its wide variety of promising biological properties, such as anticancer, antioxidant, antibacterial, neuroprotection and anti-inflammatory activities. However, the medicinal application of resveratrol is extremely constrained due to its poor bioavailability and stability. In the past decade, more attention has been focused in exploring resveratrol derivatives to improve its pharmacological activities or pharmacokinetics. This review covers the literatures published over the past 15 years for the isolated and synthesized analogues/derivatives of resveratrol. The emphasis is on the chemistry of new compounds together with the relevant biological activities and Structure-activity relationship. This review might be useful for guide further optimization and may helpful to develop of resveratrol-based clinical drugs.",New Mechanism of Amyloid Fibril Formation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30686252,Current protein & peptide science,2019 05 29,"Polymorphism is a specific feature of the amyloid structures. We have studied the amyloid structures and the process of their formation using the synthetic and recombinant preparations of Aβ peptides and their three fragments. The fibrils of different morphology were obtained for these peptides. We suppose that fibril formation by Aβ peptides and their fragments proceeds according to the simplified scheme: destabilized monomer → ring-like oligomer → mature fibril that consists of ringlike oligomers. We are the first who did 2D reconstruction of amyloid fibrils provided that just a ringlike oligomer is the main building block in fibril of any morphology, like a cell in an organism. Taking this into account it is easy to explain the polymorphism of fibrils as well as the splitting of mature fibrils under different external actions, the branching and inhomogeneity of fibril diameters. Identification of regions in the protein chains that form the backbone of amyloid fibril is a direction in the investigation of amyloid formation. It has been demonstrated for Aβ(1-42) peptide and its fragments that their complete structure is inaccessible for the action of proteases, which is an evidence of different ways of association of ring-like oligomers with the formation of fibrils. Based on the electron microscopy and mass spectrometry data, we have proposed a molecular model of the fibril formed by both Aβ peptide and its fragments. In connection with this, the unified way of formation of fibrils by oligomers, which we have discovered, could facilitate the development of relevant fields of medicine of common action.",Efficacy and Safety of Addition of Anti-PD1 to Chemotherapy in Treatment of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30686251,Combinatorial chemistry & high throughput screening,2019 03 13,Patients with previously treated non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have limited treatment options.

Due to the emergence of novel studies and inappropriate inclusion of overlapping populations, an updated meta-analysis on recent evidences is necessarily needed. We comprehensively searched databases of PubMed, Web of Science and Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure and finally obtained 7 eligible studies according to the inclusion criteria. Four positions on VDR gene, namely ApaI (rs7975232), BsmI (rs1544410), FokI (rs10735810) and TaqI (rs731236), were considered in this investigation. Data pooling found no significant association of lung cancer risk with ApaI or FokI. In contrast, it was indicated that the BsmI A allele was negatively related to the lung cancer risk, compared with the G allele (OR = 0.51, 95% CI = 0.33-0.79). Individuals with BsmI AA (OR = 0.53, 95% CI = 0.26-1.11) and AG genotypes (OR = 0.46, 95% CI = 0.30-0.71) showed decreased risk of lung cancer, compared with those of GG genotype. Regarding the TaqI polymorphism, the T allele carriers were at increased risk of lung cancer (OR = 1.25, 95% CI = 1.04-1.50). Compared with the TaqI TC+CC genotype, the TT genotype was positively associated with lung cancer risk (OR = 1.42, 95% CI = 1.11-1.82). No publication bias was identified in any of the analysis. In conclusion, VDR genetic polymorphism may be correlated to lung cancer risk.

Treatment is becoming complicated due to the development of antimicrobial resistance, especially in the main pathogen, Staphylococcus aureus. Ozenoxacin, a novel non-fluorinated topical quinolone antimicrobial, has demonstrated efficacy in impetigo. Areas covered: This article reviews the microbiology, pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties of ozenoxacin, and its clinical and microbiological efficacy in impetigo. Expert opinion: In an environment of increasing antimicrobial resistance and concurrent slowdown in antimicrobial development, the introduction of a new agent is a major event. Ozenoxacin is characterized by simultaneous affinity for DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, appears to be impervious to certain efflux pumps that confer bacterial resistance to other quinolones, shows low selection of resistant mutants, and has a mutant prevention concentration below its concentration in skin. These mechanisms protect ozenoxacin against development of resistance, while the absence of a fluorine atom in its structure confers a better safety profile versus fluoroquinolones. In vitro studies have demonstrated high potency of ozenoxacin against staphylococci and streptococci including resistant strains of S. aureus. Clinical trials of ozenoxacin in patients with impetigo reported high clinical and microbiological success rates.

The aim of this study was to validate a whole-slide imaging scanner for cytological samples. Sixty cytological samples, whose diagnoses were confirmed by gold-standard examinations (histology or flow cytometry), were digitalized using a whole-slide imaging scanner. Digital slides and glass slides were examined by 3 observers with different levels of cytopathological expertise. No significant differences were noted between digital and glass slides in regard to the number of cases correctly diagnosed, or the sensitivity, specificity, or diagnostic accuracy, irrespective of the observers' expertise. The agreements between the digital slides and the gold-standard examinations were moderate to substantial, while the agreements between the glass slides and the gold-standard examinations were substantial for all 3 observers. The intraobserver agreements between digital and glass slides were substantial to almost perfect. The interobserver agreements when evaluating digital slides were moderate between observers 1 and 2 and between observers 1 and 3 while they were substantial between observers 2 and 3.

Polymer edition,2019 03 26,"Adipose tissue yields adult adipose stem cells (ASCs) in large quantities via less-invasive methods. These cells are of interest owing to their modulating properties and paracrine activities, which can be harnessed in regenerative medicine. Many studies on the use of rat fat tissue in an autologous animal model have been conducted; however, the different locations to obtain stromal vascular fraction of rat fat depots have not been fully characterized. The purpose of the current study was to identify optimal source of ASC from various locations of rat body. Animal experiments in vitro revealed that fat depots from cervical fat are an optimal ASC source. A high ASC yield facilitates subsequent studies on autologous transplantation in rats. The secondary objective was to compare the efficiency of osteoinductive media composition and evaluate of osteogenic potential of ASCs for seeding on scaffolds for bone repair. Scaffolds were assessed in vitro, using rat adipose stem cells and three-dimensional (3D) scaffolds comprising polycaprolactone (PCL) or polycaprolactone covered with tricalcium phosphate (PCL + 5%TCP). Seeded ASCs adhere to the surface and migrate to the scaffolds. Upon staining and determining alkaline phosphatase levels, PCL + 5%TCP scaffolds performed better than PCL scaffolds. Furthermore, growth factors such as BMP2 and FGF2 significantly increased ASC mineralization and induced osteogenesis (p < 0.05).

Polymer edition,2019 03 01,"How to improve the bioavailability of the Sanguis Draconis (SD) is an important problem in the potential clinical applications. The aim of this study was to develop a drug delivery system to achieve high bioavailability of SD, a drug with poor water solubility. It will promote the research about new formulations of the SD and the other insoluble drugs. In this study, a highly biocompatible hydrophilic polymer, polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), was selected as a carrier, mixed with different proportions of SD to produce SD-PVP microfibers by solution electrospinning. By orthogonal experiments, the optimal spinning conditions of the preparation of SD-PVP fibers were investigated. The morphology of different proportions of SD-PVP microfibers was observed by scanning electron microscopy, and the phase characteristics were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectrometry, X-ray diffraction, and differential scanning calorimetry. The hydrophilic properties of SD-PVP fiber membranes with different SD content were analyzed by the water contact angle assay. In vitro dissolution experiments were carried out to observe the dissolution of drugs in SD-PVP fiber membranes. The results showed that the diameter of SD-PVP fibers increased with the enlargement of SD content. A eutectic mixture was formed after blending PVP and SD, and the hydrogen bonds were formed between the SD and PVP with no chemical reaction occurred. The dispersion of SD in the fiber decreased with the increase of SD content. The higher the content of SD in the fiber, the more hydrophobic the fiber membrane. In vitro dissolution studies revealed that the dissolution content of SD from SD-PVP microfibers was significantly higher than that of the pure or original drug SD. However, as the SD content increased from 15% to 30%, the dissolution of the drug in the SD-PVP fibers decreased. The SD-PVP fiber prepared in this study showed much higher solubility than the original drug in vitro, which has great significance for the development of new dosage forms for the clinical application of SD, and it has a useful reference for the study of similar bioavailability of poorly soluble drugs.",What makes us busy?

Nevertheless, the characteristics that are associated with greater perceived busyness are unknown. To address this question participants (N = 463) from the Dallas Lifespan Brain Study (ages 20-89) completed a self-report busyness assessment and demographic, health, personality, and lifestyle measures. Results revealed that perceived busyness peaked in 30-year-olds, showed age-related decreases until age 60, and then remained stable. Moreover, women generally reported being busier than men. Analysis of age by gender interactions revealed that men exhibited a significant cubic age effect for busyness, whereas women did not. Overall, younger age, female gender, agreeableness, neuroticism, frequent participation in novel activities, and enjoyment of cognitive processing were independently associated with being busier, and the characteristics related to busyness were generally stable across age. Notably, participation in novel activities and need for cognition were the most predictive lifestyle characteristics, supporting the framing of busyness as an indicator of mental engagement. We also propose personality-based sources of self-generated and other-generated busyness."

The dynamic assembly and disassembly of the different autophagic protein complexes at the so-called phagophore assembly site (PAS) is strictly regulated. Rab GTPases are major regulators of cellular vesicle trafficking, and the Rab GTPase Ypt1 and its GEF TRAPPIII have been implicated in autophagy. We show that Gyp1 acts as a Ypt1 GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for selective autophagic variants, such as the Cvt pathway or the selective autophagic degradation of mitochondria (mitophagy). Gyp1 regulates the dynamic disassembly of the conserved Ypt1-Atg1 complex. Thereby, Gyp1 sets the stage for efficient Atg14 recruitment, and facilitates the critical step from nucleation to elongation of the phagophore. In addition, we identified Gyp1 as a new Atg8-interacting motif (AIM)-dependent Atg8 interaction partner. The Gyp1 AIM is required for efficient formation of the cargo receptor-Atg8 complexes. Our findings elucidate the molecular mechanisms of complex disassembly during phagophore formation and suggest potential dual functions of GAPs in cellular vesicle trafficking.

The present study aimed to identify subgroups of FPG trajectories with assessing CVD incidence. Methods and Results The present study was based on the Suita study, a population-based cohort study in Japan. The primary outcome was incidence of the first CVD events consisting of stroke and coronary heart diseases between 1989 and 2013. The main exposure was FPG assessed every 2 years. We used joint latent class mixed models to derive FPG trajectories over time while evaluating cumulative incidence of CVD , and categorized participants into several subgroups based on those trajectories and cumulative incidence. We observed 356 and 243 CVD events during the median follow-up of 17.2 and 20.2 years among 3120 men and 3482 women, respectively. The joint latent mixed models found 3 subgroups in men and 2 subgroups in women. Of the 3 subgroups in men, 1 subgroup had FPG levels that increased sharply (96.5-205.0 mg/dL from aged 40 to 80 years) and higher CVD cumulative incidence. Of the 2 subgroups in women, 1 subgroup had FPG levels that increased sharply (97.7-190.5 mg/dL from aged 40 to 80 years) and tended to have slightly higher CVD incidence compared with the other subgroup. Conclusion It can be important to manage CVD risk factors especially for people whose FPG trajectories sharply increased to prevent CVD .",Maintaining mitochondria in beige adipose tissue.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30686106,Adipocyte,2019 04 29,"Individual cell types vary enormously in the amount of different organelles they contain. One such organelle is the mitochondrion. Understanding how mitochondrial levels are controlled is essential since so many disease states seem to involve mitochondrial function. The beige adipocyte is an inducible form of adipocyte that emerges in response to cold exposure and some other external stimuli. To perform its thermogenic function, its level of mitochondria increases dramatically. If the stimuli are removed the mitochondrial levels return to base line. Following the withdrawal of external stimuli, beige adipocytes directly acquire a white fat-like phenotype through mitophagy-mediated mitochondrial degradation.

Methods and Results The SPS3 (Secondary Prevention of Small Subcortical Strokes) trial randomized participants with recent lacunar stroke to systolic BP targets of 130 to 149 and <130 mm Hg. We included 2454 participants with WMH measured by clinical magnetic resonance imaging at baseline and serum creatinine measured during follow-up. We tested interactions between BP target and WMH burden on the incidence of rapid kidney function decline (≥30% decrease from baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate at 1-year follow-up) and recurrent stroke. Rapid kidney function decline incidence was 11.0% in the lower- BP -target arm and 8.1% in the higher-target arm (odds ratio=1.40; 95% CI=1.07-1.84). Odds ratio for rapid kidney function decline between lower- and higher-target groups ranged from 1.26 in the lowest WMH tertile (95% CI , 0.80-1.98) to 1.71 in the highest tertile (95% CI , 1.05-2.80; P for interaction=0.65). Overall incidence of recurrent stroke was 7.9% in the lower-target arm and 9.6% in the higher-target arm (hazard ratio=0.80; 95% CI , 0.63-1.03). Hazard ratio for recurrent stroke in the lower-target group was 1.13 (95% CI , 0.73-1.75) within the lowest WMH tertile compared with 0.73 (95% CI , 0.49-1.09) within the highest WMH tertile ( P for interaction=0.04). Conclusions Participants with higher WMH burden appeared to experience greater benefit from intensive BP lowering in prevention of recurrent stroke. By contrast, intensive BP lowering increased the odds of kidney function decline, but WMH burden did not significantly distinguish this risk.

Here, we describe the participation of Forkhead box class O (FOXO) in cell fate specification of a small subset of Drosophila ventral olfactory projection neurons (vPNs). Using the two-color labeling system, twin-spot MARCM, we determined the temporal birth order of each vPN type, and this characterization served as a foundation to investigate regulators of cell fate specification. Flies deficient for chinmo, a known temporal cell fate regulator, exhibited a partial loss of vPNs, suggesting that the gene plays a complex role in specifying vPN cell fate and is not the only regulator of this process. Interestingly, loss of foxo function resulted in the precocious appearance of late-born vPNs in place of early-born vPNs, whereas overexpression of constitutively active FOXO caused late-born vPNs to take on a morphology reminiscent of earlier born vPNs. Taken together, these data suggest that FOXO temporally regulates vPN cell fate specification. The comprehensive identification of molecules that regulate neuronal fate specification promises to provide a better understanding of the mechanisms governing the formation of functional brain tissue.",Direct complications and routine ICU admission after total laryngectomy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30686089,Acta oto-laryngologica,2019 06 13,"In the Netherlands Cancer Institute (NCI), patients are admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) after total laryngectomy (TL).",Unattended Versus Attended Blood Pressure Measurement.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30686088,"Hypertension (Dallas, Tex. : 1979)",2019 02 13,"It has been suggested that measurement of unattended or automated oscillatory blood pressure (BP) values may provide advantages over conventional BP measurement. Some international guidelines now suggest automated oscillatory BP as the preferred approach for measuring BP. Data on the relationship between automated oscillatory BP and cardiovascular events are much less solid as compared to those obtained with the standard approach; preliminary data suggested that automated oscillatory BP might be more strictly correlated with organ damage. The aim of our study was to evaluate the relationship between attended or unattended BP and organ damage in 564 subjects undergoing an echocardiogram and carotid ultrasound at an European Society of Hypertension Excellence Center.Both unattended BP (patient alone in the room, an oscillometric device programmed to perform 3 BP measurements, at 1-minute intervals, after 5 minutes) and attended BP were measured with the same device, on the same day of the ultrasonographic examination, in random order. In 564 patients (age 61±15 years, 41% female 78% hypertensives) systolic unattended BP was lower as compared with attended BP (128.0±15.5 versus 134.5±19.9 mm Hg). Left ventricular mass index was similarly correlated with attended and unattended systolic BP ( r=0.205 and r=0.194, respectively). Carotid intima-media thickness was also significantly correlated with both attended and unattended systolic BP (mean max intima-media thickness: r=0.206 and r=0.194, respectively, P<0.0001). The differences between correlations were not statistically significant. Our results suggest that attended and unattended BP values are similarly related with hypertensive organ damage.",Caloric Restriction Exacerbates Angiotensin II-Induced Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm in the Absence of p53.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30686087,"Hypertension (Dallas, Tex. : 1979)",2019 02 13,"p53-dependent vascular smooth muscle cell senescence is a key pathological process of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). Caloric restriction (CR) is a nonpharmacological intervention that prevents AAA formation. However, whether p53 is indispensable to the protective role of CR remains unknown. In this study, we investigated the necessity of p53 in the beneficial role of CR in AAA formation and the underlying mechanisms. We subjected p53+/+ and p53-/- mice to 12 weeks of CR and then examined the incidence of Ang II (angiotensin II)-induced AAA formation. We found that both CR and p53 knockout reduced Ang II-induced AAA formation; however, CR markedly increased the incidence of AAA formation and exacerbated aortic elastin degradation in p53-/- mice, accompanied by increased vascular senescence, reactive oxygen species generation, and reduced energy production. Analysis of mitochondrial respiratory activity revealed that dysfunctional complex IV accounts for the abnormal mitochondrial respiration in p53-/- vascular smooth muscle cells treated by CR serum. Mechanistically, ablation of p53 almost totally blocked the protective role of CR by inhibiting SCO2 (cytochrome C oxidase assembly protein 2)-dependent mitochondrial complex IV activity. Overexpression of SCO2 restored the beneficial effect of CR on antagonizing Ang II-induced expression of AAA-related molecules and reactive oxygen species generation in p53-/- vascular smooth muscle cells. Together, our findings demonstrate that the existence of p53 in vascular smooth muscle cells is critical to the protective role of CR in Ang II-induced AAA formation by maintaining an appropriate mitochondrial function.",Circulating Long Noncoding RNA LIPCAR Predicts Heart Failure Outcomes in Patients Without Chronic Kidney Disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30686085,"Hypertension (Dallas, Tex. : 1979)",2019 03 13,"The plasma levels of long noncoding RNA LIPCAR are elevated in heart failure (HF) patients with reduced ejection fraction and associated with left ventricular remodeling and poor outcomes. We studied whether the presence of chronic kidney disease (CKD), as defined by an estimated glomerular filtration rate value <60mL/(min·1.73m2) modified the associations of plasma LIPCAR with left ventricular remodeling and outcomes in HF patients. Two hundred and thirty-four patients (mean age 74 [9.14] years, 50% male) were enrolled and followed for 4.73 (0.24-7.25) years. Plasma LIPCAR was detected by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. LIPCAR was increased ( P=0.005) in patients compared with 17 age- and sex-matched controls, directly correlated with age ( P=0.001) and with the maximal early transmitral flow velocity to the mean peak early diastolic velocity of the mitral annulus displacement ratio ( P=0.001) and inversely correlated with estimated glomerular filtration rate ( P<0.001). LIPCAR was associated with hospitalization for HF, cardiovascular death, and a composite of hospitalization for HF or cardiovascular death ( P≤0.010), these associations being dependent of estimated glomerular filtration rate. The interactions between estimated glomerular filtration rate and LIPCAR with respect to these outcomes were statistically significant or of borderline significance ( P≤0.060). LIPCAR was increased in CKD patients compared with non-CKD patients ( P=0.021). LIPCAR was independently associated with hospitalization for HF ( P≤0.039) only in non-CKD patients, but its addition to traditional risk factors did not improve risk prediction in these patients. In conclusion, plasma LIPCAR prognosticates outcomes in elderly HF patients without CKD. Thus, there is an effect modification of CKD on the association of circulating LIPCAR with outcomes in HF patients.",A reflection on the possibility of finding a good surrogate.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30686082,Journal of biopharmaceutical statistics,2019 05 22,"Surrogate endpoints need to be statistically evaluated before they can be used as substitutes of true endpoints in clinical studies. However, even though several evaluation methods have been introduced over the last decades, the identification of good surrogate endpoints remains practically and conceptually challenging. In the present work, the question regarding the existence of a good surrogate is addressed using information-theoretic concepts, within a causal-inference framework. The methodology can help practitioners to assess, given a clinically relevant true endpoint and a treatment of interest, the chances of finding a good surrogate endpoint in the first place. The methodology focuses on binary outcomes and is illustrated using data from the Initial Glaucoma Treatment Study. Furthermore, a newly developed and user friendly R package Surrogate is provided to carry out the necessary calculations.",Collegiate athletic trainers' perceptions of the benefits and drawbacks of interprofessional collaborative practice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30686081,Journal of interprofessional care,2019 01 28,Interprofessional collaborative practice (IPCP) is a recommended area of emphasis within healthcare. Little is known regarding athletic trainers' perceptions of benefits and drawbacks to participation in IPCP. A cross-sectional survey design with open-ended questions was utilised to survey 513 athletic trainers from across the United States. Data were extracted and analysed following a general inductive qualitative approach to determine categories and subcategories. Triangulation occurred via multi-analyst coding and review of findings by an external auditor. Athletic trainers' perceptions of IPCP align with the Interprofessional Education Collaborative (IPEC) Core Competencies. A team approach to care and improved patient care are perceived as benefits to IPCP. Learning and understanding the roles of other healthcare professionals as well as communication among team members are perceived as both benefits and drawbacks to IPCP. The ability to appreciate and implement the IPEC Core Competencies may help the athletic trainer participate in the growing IPCP culture. Identification and dissemination of strategies to increase IPCP participation among athletic trainers are needed.,Cognitive screening in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: patient's perspectives.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30686080,Disability and rehabilitation,2019 01 28,"Cognitive impairment is highly prevalent (61%) in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

The purpose of this study was to understand students' perceptions of the roles and responsibilities of other health-care professionals. Students enrolled in occupational therapy, pharmacy, physical therapy, and physician assistant programs at a university participated in a three-hour IPE workshop. Throughout this workshop, they worked in small interprofessional teams to identify unique and shared roles and responsibilities of health professions. Students used a ""dream catcher"" graphic organizer to compare and contrast these roles and responsibilities. Researchers used thematic analysis of completed graphic organizers to identify themes in students' perceptions. Students identified many shared and unique characteristics about their professions' values and expertise, patient care process, practice settings, patient populations, education, and regulations. While students correctly identified many aspects of their professions, there were some inaccuracies that were addressed by small group faculty facilitators.",Reviewing estimates of the burden in disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) of tick-borne encephalitis in Slovenia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30686078,Expert review of pharmacoeconomics & outcomes research,2019 05 02,"Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) reflects an increasing burden and can affect public health policy.

Areas covered: This burden is relatively high in Slovenia and can be estimated by using an incidence-based disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) methodology. Notably, DALYs have been estimated for Slovenia in various studies. The present study summarizes the main differences and conclusions between two studies that dealt with the calculation of DALYs for TBE in Slovenia. The databases of PubMed and Embase were used to get information about publications that dealt with the TBE burden, using an incidence-based DALYs methodology, in Slovenia. Expert opinion: Permanent sequelae contribute the most to the total burden in DALYs. Increasing vaccination in all ages and age groups can be the most effective and efficient strategy to reduce the burden of TBE and protect the whole population health."

Secondary objectives included determining the most commonly assessed HQIs, extent of team collaboration, and the healthcare practitioners that most commonly comprise MSK-assessment teams. This review was registered in the PROSPERO database and conducted according to PRISMA guidelines. Five databases were systematically searched to August 2017. Studies selected met a priori inclusion criteria and investigated an HQI outcome of a primary or intermediate care MSK team-based assessment aimed at directing treatment. Two independent raters assessed study quality [Downs and Black (DB) criteria] and level of evidence (Oxford Centre of Evidence-Based Medicine model). Ten studies were included. The majority were low-quality [median DB score 14/32 (range 6-18)] pre-experimental studies (level 4 evidence). Heterogeneity in methodology and HQIs precluded meta-analyses. Hospital length-of-stay (LOS; 3/10 studies) and pain level (3/10) were the most common HQIs investigated. Teams (9/10) were most commonly comprised of a physiotherapist and another healthcare practitioner. Most teams (8/10) demonstrated low-levels of collaboration. There is limited low-level evidence to suggest that team-based MSK assessments are associated with improved clinical outcomes (i.e., pain, quality-of-life) and shorter LOS.",Braided stents and their impact in intracranial aneurysm treatment for distal locations: from flow diverters to low profile stents.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30686064,Expert review of medical devices,2019 06 07,"Intracranial aneurysms in distal locations are sometimes difficult to treat due to their branching locations and the presence of blister-like or very wide-necked aneurysms. Braided intracranial stents, including flow diverters (FDs) and low-profile braided intracranial stents (LPBSs) may provide additional advantages, due to their flow-diverting properties. Areas covered: The use of FDs in off-label, distal intracranial locations has been increasing with promising outcomes and has given rise to the LPBS, which has less flow-diverting properties, allowing for easier use in distal branching sites through 0.017' microcatheters. These devices have shifted the interest from the aneurysm's sac filling to the regional remodeling through the effect of flow diversion. The purpose of this article is to discuss their functionality, safety, performance, and perspectives through a critical review of important publications of the last 11.5 years (January 2007 to July 2018) on the use of these devices at and beyond the circle of Willis. Expert opinion: FDs modify the regional anatomy thus careful pre-procedural consideration of the regional hemodynamic equilibrium is mandatory, as well as effective antiplatelet regimen. LPBSs provide moderate flow-diversion effect, which may be an advantage, especially for very distal and small aneurysms.",Motivators and barriers to using information and communication technology in everyday life following stroke: a qualitative and video observation study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30686063,Disability and rehabilitation,2019 01 28,Information and communication technology devices have become a ubiquitous part of everyday life and a primary means of communication.

Foster and adoptive parents reported on the children's socioemotional competence and behavior problems, experimenters scored fear and positive affect to laboratory tasks, and diurnal cortisol measures were obtained. We sought to address whether these early contexts, characterized by different types of neglect and deprivation, have differential effects on young children's development. We found little support for the argument that either context results in uniformly poorer functioning soon after removal from adversity. Maltreated children were less fearful and more positive when exposed to both positive and novel events than institutionally-reared children. However, maltreated children were reported to have more behavior problems than did institutionally-reared children, and institutionally-reared children showed more typical declines in cortisol throughout the day than the maltreated children. These findings increase our ability to construct more targeted and effective interventions for these populations.","Collaboration for children with complex needs: What adolescents, parents, and practitioners tell us.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30686059,Journal of child health care : for professionals working with children in the hospital and community,2019 01 28,"Children with complex needs require coordinated care and collaboration between the different sectors in child mental health care.

A qualitative design with semistructured individual interviews is used, guided by the questions from the Wraparound Fidelity Index. Useful and practical insights on effective collaboration result from the in-depth analysis of the interviews. A neutral chairperson, the presence of specialist practitioners, visualization, participation of adolescents, and parents are among the effective elements reported. Some challenges remain; the principle of equality, monitoring the action points resulting from the collaboration and effective crisis management seem very difficult to fully achieve in practice.

The HPV Impact Profile (HIP) is a comprehensive instrument used to assess the psychosocial impact of HPV and related interventions in a wide range of domains. The main purpose of this study was to validate the HIP in Portuguese women, so that it can be used in this population, both in research and in clinical settings. Methods: A sample of 178 Portuguese women infected with HPV were assessed with the following instruments: Index of Sexual Satisfaction, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and HPV Impact Profile. Results: The results of the confirmatory factor analysis showed some changes to the original model, which resulted in an adapted version with six domains, compared to the seven domains of the original model. The final model showed a good fit to the data. All Cronbach's alphas were higher than 0.79 indicating a high level of internal consistency of the subscales. As in the original HIP questionnaire, the exception was sexual impact, with a lower, but acceptable, Cronbach's alpha. Convergent and discriminant validities of the instrument were also assessed. Conclusions: The Portuguese version of the HIP presents good psychometric properties, allowing its use in clinical trials as well as in clinical practice in order to evaluate quality of life in women with HPV."

An endoscopic approach (percutaneous endoscopic lumbar discectomy; PELD), MIS-TLIF combined with contralateral translaminar screw (MIS-TLIF CTS), and MIS-TLIF combined with bilateral pedicle screws (MIS-TLIF BPS) were evaluated via a retrospective chart review. Data from 74 consecutive middle-aged and elderly patients with far lateral disc herniation were analyzed. All patients underwent surgery; 19 with PELD, 24 with MIS-TLIF CTS, and 31 with MIS-TLIF BPS. Clinical data included the length of the incision, duration of the operation, estimated blood loss, hospitalization time, operation cost, recurrence rate, and fusion rate. Preoperative and postoperative patient outcomes including the VAS, ODI scores and MacNab criteria were assessed and recorded. The mean follow-up time was 26.4 months (range from 14 to 46 months). Compared with the internal fixation groups, the length of the incision, duration of operation, estimated blood loss, and hospitalization time were obviously lower in the PELD group. The difference in operation cost among the three methods was statistically significant. The postoperative VAS scores for LBP and LP decreased significantly as compared with those recorded preoperatively. The postoperative ODI scores were lower than those recorded preoperatively. MacNab criteria rating excellent, good and fair results were in 27, 37 and 10 patients, respectively. Conclusion: PELD, MIS-TLIF CTS, and MIS-TLIF BPS are all effective minimally invasive techniques for the therapy of single segment far lateral lumbar disc herniation in middle-aged and elderly patients. PELD had a shorter operation time and less surgical trauma, being a less invasive and more economical method; however, there was no recurrence of disc herniation after fixation. Compared with MIS-TLIF BPS, MIS-TLIF CTS obtained a similar clinical effect and certain costs were saved.",Do adolescents with cerebral palsy meet recommendations for healthy weight and physical activity behaviours?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30686039,Disability and rehabilitation,2019 01 28,"Describe physical activity energy expenditure, body composition, and nutritional intake in adolescents with cerebral palsy (CP) in the context of health recommendations.","Cumulative stigma among injured immigrant workers: a qualitative exploratory study in Montreal (Quebec, Canada).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30686038,Disability and rehabilitation,2019 01 28,"This paper presents the phenomenon of stigmatisation among injured immigrant and ethnocultural minority workers experiencing a long-standing disability.

The basal lamina is continuous at the capsule and septae, but it becomes discontinuous at the border between the keratin-positive network and keratin-negative area. This immunohistochemical finding is the first histological sign, which may explain that the medulla has no blood-thymus barrier. The supporting tissue of the keratin-negative area is identical with that of the septae. The connective tissue of thymic capsule and septae develops from the cranial neural crest cells, therefore we hypothesize that the keratin-negative area has neural crest origin. Blood vessels of the thymic medulla localize in the keratin-negative area. Every emigrating or immigrating immunologically competent cells should enter the keratin-negative area, therefore this area is the transit zone of the thymus. The hematoxylin-eosin staining of the thymus shows that the thymic cortico-medullary border does not represent cellular background. However, the border between keratin-positive network and keratin-negative area is determined by cellular identity (epithelial and mesenchymal tissues). Therefore, it can be assumed that the real histological and functional border is the border between the keratin-positive network and the keratin-negative area.

Due to their small size, easy entrance to cells and multiple targets, microRNAs (miRs) are considered novel and attractive targets. In the current study, parental MKN-45, MKN-45-control vector, and MKN-45-miR-31 populations were compared in terms of cell cycle transitions, migration, cell invasion, and proliferation. In addition, downstream targets of miR-31, including E2F6, and SMUG1 were examined using Real-time RT-PCR and western blotting. MKN-45-miR-31 showed an increased sensitivity to 5-FU, decreased migration and cell invasion compared to the control groups (p = 0.0001, p = 0.01 and p = 0.01, respectively). There was a significant increase in the percentage of cells in G1/pre-G1 phase in MKN-45-miR-31 relative to the control groups (p = 0.001). Induction of miR-31 expression in MKN-45 caused a significant reduction of E2F6 and SMUG1 genes. Our findings indicated that induction of miR-31 expression could increase drug sensitivity, and diminish tumor cell migration and invasion of gastric cancer cells. Therefore, miR-31 can be considered as a potential target molecule in the targeted therapy of gastric cancer (Fig. 2, Ref. 43).

This continued growth arises from neural stem or progenitor cells (NSCs) located in specific regions of the adult brain, including the subventricular zone and the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. Increased understanding of the nature of these cells and their reaction to environmental stimuli is of paramount importance in the effort to discern their role and potential use in repair following neurological disruption. Neurosphere suspension culture is identified as an effective way of actualizing a self-renewing population of neural stem cells. This study demonstrated that adult rat neural stem cells could be effectively induced to differentiate into cells of astrocytic lineage through exposure to fetal bovine serum (FBS), and that the same population of precursor cells could be induced toward neuronal lineage through exposure to dibutyryl cyclic adenosine monophosphate (dcAMP). There were also observations noted regarding difficulty inducing cell attachment following enzymatic digestion of neurospheres, and potential effects on various types of assays, including migration assays (Fig. 7, Ref. 31).

Allison and Tasuku Honjo ""for their discovery of cancer therapy by inhibition of negative immune regulation"". A number of therapeutic approaches are available for cancer treatment, including surgery, radiation, and other strategies, some of which have been awarded previous Nobel Prizes. These include methods for hormone treatment for prostate cancer (Huggins, 1966), chemotherapy (Elion and Hitchins, 1988), and bone marrow transplantation for leukemia (Thomas, 1990). Many scientists engaged in intense basic research and uncovered fundamental mechanisms regulating immunity and also showed how the immune system can recognize cancer cells. T-cells were shown to have receptors that bind to structures recognized as non-self and such interactions trigger the immune system to engage in defense. However, additional proteins acting as T-cell accelerators are also required to trigger a full-blown immune response. Many scientists contributed to this important basic research and identified other proteins that function as brakes on the T-cells, inhibiting immune activation. This intricate balance between the accelerators and inhibitors is essential for a tight control. New strategy was developed into a therapy for humans. Promising results soon emerged from several groups, and in 2010 an important clinical study showed striking effects in patients with advanced melanoma. In several patients, signs of remaining cancer disappeared. The results were dramatic, leading to long-term remission and possible cure in several patients with metastatic cancer, a condition that had previously been considered essentially untreatable. Such remarkable results had never been seen in this patient group before (Fig. 2, Ref. 12).

We deal with the role of AGP as a drug-binding protein and its effect on the efficacy of chemotherapy in oncological patients. Other problems that are discussed in our paper include the role of AGP as an immunomodulatory protein and its relationship to angiogenesis because angiogenesis plays an important role in the progression of cancer (Ref. 57).

One of the barriers to the development and approval of effective interventions has been the lack of agreement on the proper endpoints for study. The international consensus definition of cancer cachexia focuses on 3 major components of the syndrome. This includes altered body composition characterized specifically by loss of skeletal muscle mass. The muscle loss in turn is a result of negative protein and energy balance secondary to reduced food intake and abnormal metabolism. The result of muscle loss is progressive functional impairment. The assessment of interventions for cancer cachexia should include measures of all 3 components of cancer cachexia. For patients with cancer cachexia, body composition measurements of lean body mass (LBM) and fat mass may be best determined by CT imaging. Nutritional endpoints and measures of metabolism can be quite complex. However, change in appetite and body weight remain extremely useful measures of clinical benefit. The most controversial area relates to assessment of physical function. While stair climb power, 6-minute walk, hand grip strength and other measures have been used in clinical trials, none of them have shown consistent benefit that correlates with change in LBM. While we have much to learn about the inter-relationship between muscle mass and muscle function, improvement in physical function may be best measured by patient reported outcomes. Ongoing and future clinical trials in cancer cachexia should assess all 3 domains, which will improve our understanding of this syndrome and ultimately lead to better treatment options for our patients.",Electronic States of Acetic Acid in a Binary Mixture of Acetic Acid and 1-Methylimidazole Depend on the Environment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30685981,The journal of physical chemistry. B,2019 04 15,"The unique characteristics of an acetic acid/1-methylimidazole (1-MI) mixture, showing higher electrical conductivity than either neat acetic acid or neat 1-MI, yet consisting of electrically neutral molecules, are reported. We have applied soft X-ray spectroscopy to reveal the electronic states of acetic acid in the acetic acid/1-MI mixture at various mole fractions of acetic acid (χHOAc). The results show that the amount of acetic acid monomer increases in the region of especially high electrical conductivity and the amount of complex of acetic acid and 1-MI formed by sharing molecular orbitals increases in the low electrical conductivity region. There is a little amount of acetic acid monomer in the low electrical conductivity region because the complex inhibits acetic acid from creating its monomer. These results suggest the possibility that the acetic acid monomer is related to electrical conduction.","Synthesis of 1-(2-Aminovinyl)indoles and 1,3'-Biindoles by Reaction of 2,2-Diaryl-Substituted 2 H-Azirines with α-Imino Rh(II) Carbenoids.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30685980,The Journal of organic chemistry,2019 04 05,"An effective and operationally simple method for the preparation of 1-(2-(sulfonamido)vinyl)indoles (SAV-indoles) by the Rh(II)-catalyzed reaction of 2,2-diaryl-2 H-azirines with 1-sulfonyl-1,2,3-triazoles has been developed. This method enables the stereoselective synthesis of a variety of 1,2,3-trisubstituted indoles having a Z configuration of the (1-aryl-2-(sulfonamido)vinyl) substituent. The reaction mechanism, supported by DFT calculations, involves the formation of 1,4-diazahexa-1,3,5-trienes, which rapidly cyclize to 2,2-diaryl-1-sulfonyl-1,2-dihydropyrazines. These compounds can be isolated at an early stage of the reaction, but under prolonged heating they isomerize into 7a H-indolium ylides, followed by a barrierless 1,5-prototropic shift to SAV-indoles. The developed methodology was also applied to the preparation of 1,3'-biindoles from 2,2-diaryl-2 H-azirines using 3-diazoindolin-2-imines instead of 1-sulfonyl-1,2,3-triazoles."

The junctions were fabricated with the conducting probe atomic force microscope (CP-AFM) platform. Fitting of the current-voltage ( I-V) characteristics for OPT n and OPD n junctions to the analytical single-level tunneling model allows extraction of both the HOMO-to-Fermi-level offset (εh) and the average molecule-electrode coupling (Γ) as a function of molecular length ( n) and electrode work function (Φ). Significantly, direct measurements of εhUPS by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) for OPT n and OPD n SAMs on Ag, Au, and Pt agree remarkably well with the transport estimates εhtrans, providing strong support-beyond the high quality I-V simulations-for the relevance of the analytical single-level model to simple molecular tunnel junctions. Because the UPS measurements involve SAMs bonded to only one metal contact, the correspondence of εhUPS and εhtrans also indicates that the top contact has a weak effect on the HOMO energy. Corroborating ab initio calculations definitively rule out a dominant contribution of image charge effects to the magnitude of εh. Thus, the effective molecular tunnel barrier εh is determined, and essentially pinned, by the formation of a single metal-S covalent bond per OPT n or OPD n molecule.",Outcomes and clinical relevance of stool multiplex bacterial polymerase chain reaction in patients with acute diarrhea: single center experience.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30685964,The Korean journal of internal medicine,2019 01 28,"Diagnostic stool multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing has attracted considerable interest, because of its high sensitivity, short turnaround time, and ability to detect multiple organisms simultaneously.

The vagina serves as a host environment for many microorganisms, contributing greatly to its defensive mechanisms. It is not known whether the introduction of other microorganisms into the vaginal region are detrimental or require intensive preventative measures. Several national ultrasonography societies, as well as the Israel Ministry of Health, have addressed the proper and adequate handling of sonographic endovaginal probes, including the use of high-level disinfecting agents following cleansing and prior to using probe covers between patients. However, many obstetrics and gynecology ultrasound units in Israel find it difficult to adhere to these strict disinfecting requirements. While most of the guidelines are based on the theoretical risk of contaminations when ultrasound endovaginal probes are used, the rate of nosocomial infections linked to the use of these probes has yet to be verified. Based on the information available, there is an urgent need to find a solution that enables gynecological ultrasound users to properly disinfect endovaginal probes between patients.

When patients with primary nonfunction were excluded (n = 9), 141 recipients (65%) had DGF, with median (IQR) duration of dialysis dependency of 6 (2-11.75) days.

A-T patients represent a broad range of clinical manifestations including progressive cerebellar ataxia, oculocutaneous telangiectasia, variable immunodeficiency, radiosensitivity, susceptibility to malignancies, and increased metabolic diseases. This congenital disorder has phenotypic heterogeneity, and the severity of symptoms varies in different patients based on severity of mutations and disease progression. The principal role of nuclear ATM is the coordination of cellular signaling pathways in response to DNA double-strand breaks, oxidative stress, and cell cycle checkpoint. The pathogenesis of A-T is not limited to the role of ATM in the DNA damage response (DDR) pathway, and it has other functions mainly in the hematopoietic cells and neurons. ATM adjusts the functions of organelles such as mitochondria and peroxisomes and also regulates angiogenesis and glucose metabolisms. However, ATM has other functions in the cells (especially cell viability) that need further investigations.

However, accurate data on the incidence of cancer in this population is lacking. In a prospective cohort study, we followed-up with all patients who experienced two unprovoked symptomatic VTE events that occurred in less than 2 years apart. We estimated the 1-year incidence rate of cancer following the second unprovoked VTE event using the Kaplan-Meier method. Potential predictors for cancer diagnosis were assessed using a Cox proportional hazard regression model. Between May 2000 and December 2013, we included 197 patients with two episodes of symptomatic unprovoked VTE that occurred in less than 2 years apart. Their mean age was 66.2 ± 16.3 years, and 122 (51.8%) were male. Seventeen patients were diagnosed with cancer during the year following the second episode of unprovoked VTE, corresponding to a cumulative incidence rate of 9.19% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 5.81-14.37). The 1-year cumulative incidence rate of cancer was 35.88% (95% CI: 19.75-59.25) in patients with VTE recurrence on anticoagulation, 5.51% (95% CI: 2.9-10.32) among patients with a second episode of unprovoked VTE occurring after stopping anticoagulation and 1.15% (95% CI: 0.16-7.88) when time elapsed between the first and recurrent VTE was > 1 year.

Btk in platelets mediates platelet activation via glycoprotein (GP) VI, which is crucial for atherosclerotic plaque-induced platelet thrombus formation. This can be selectively inhibited by Btk inhibitors. Since patients on second-generation Btk inhibitors apparently show less bleeding than patients on ibrutinib, we compared the effects of ibrutinib and four novel irreversible Btk inhibitors on GPVI-dependent platelet aggregation in blood and in vitro bleeding time. Low concentrations of collagen which induced the same low degree of GPVI-mediated platelet aggregation as atherosclerotic plaque material were applied. IC50 values for collagen (0.2-0.5 µg/mL)-induced platelet aggregation after 15-minute pre-incubation were: ibrutinib 0.12 µM, BGB-3111 0.51 µM, acalabrutinib 1.21 µM, ONO/GS-4059 1.20 µM and evobrutinib 5.84 µM. Peak venous plasma concentrations of ibrutinib (0.5 µM), acalabrutinib (2 µM) and ONO/GS-4059 (2 µM) measured after anti-proliferative dosage inhibited collagen-induced platelet aggregation, but did not increase PFA-200 closure time on collagen/epinephrine. Closure times were moderately increased by 2- to 2.5-fold higher concentrations of these inhibitors, but not by BGB-3111 (1 µM) and evobrutinib (10 µM). Prolonging platelet drug exposure to 60 minutes lowered IC50 values of any Btk inhibitor for GPVI-mediated aggregation by several fold, and 5- to 10-fold below anti-proliferative therapeutic drug plasma levels. In conclusion, low blood concentrations of ibrutinib and the novel Btk inhibitors suffice for GPVI selective platelet inhibition relevant for atherothrombosis but do not impair primary haemostasis."

However, the underlying mechanisms of this neural-pancreatic interaction are not well understood and therefore often neglected, despite their significance to achieving an optimal glucose control. As a result, the dynamics of insulin release from the pancreas are currently described by mathematical models that reproduce the behavior of the β cells using exclusively glucose levels and other hormones as inputs. To bridge this gap, we have combined, for the first time, metabolic and neural mathematical models in a unified system to reproduce to a great extent the ideal glucoregulation observed in healthy subjects. Our results satisfactorily replicate the CPIR and its impact during the post-absorptive phase. Furthermore, the proposed model gives insight into the physiological interaction between the brain and the pancreas in healthy people and suggests the potential of considering the neural information for restoring glucose control in people with diabetes.

When modeling firing patterns obtained from automatic procedures, false positives and false negatives can be taken into account to enhance performance in estimating firing pattern statistics. Available models of this type, however, are only approximate and use Gaussian distributions, which are not strictly suitable for modeling renewal point processes. In this paper, the theory of point processes is used to derive an exact solution to the distribution when a gamma distribution is used to model the physiological firing pattern. Besides being exact, the solution provides a way to model the skewness of the inter-discharge distribution, and this may make it possible to obtain a better fit with available experimental data. In order to demonstrate potential applications of the model, we use it to obtain a maximum likelihood estimator of firing pattern statistics. Our tests found this estimator to be reliable over a wide range of firing conditions, whether dealing with real or simulated firing patterns, the proposed solution had better agreement than other models.

Also, future DSS should incorporate multiple treatment options, integrate estimates of toxicity, quality of life and cost-effectiveness of treatments, enhance communication between caregivers and patients, and use IT solutions for a clear interface and continuous updating of tools. With this inventory among Dutch TO, we summarized the need for new DSS to aid treatment decision-making for patients with incurable NSCLC. To meet the expressed needs, substantial additional efforts will be required by DSS developers, above already existing tools.",The Effects of Continuous Care Model of Information-Based Hospital-Family Integration on Colostomy Patients: a Randomized Controlled Trial.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30685831,Journal of cancer education : the official journal of the American Association for Cancer Education,2019 01 27,"The purpose of this research was to examine the effects of continuous care model of information-based hospital-family integration on colostomy patients. Miles' operation is a major operative method for treating low rectal cancer, and this operation results in a permanent colostomy. It is difficult for patients to adapt to their colostomy. Previous studies have applied generally conventional nursing models to colostomy patients. This was a single-blind randomized controlled trial study. The sample of 155 patients who met the inclusion criteria was randomly assigned to either the experimental (n = 81) or control group (n = 74). The control group was provided with a routine standard of care. The experimental group was provided with an experimental treatment that consisted of an information-based (WeChat, blog, QQ, telephone, etc.) hospital-family integration continuous care model. Study variables were collected and instruments were selected as follows: basic information, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), a self-efficacy scale, a colostomy complication assessment table, a quality of life scale, and a table of the degree of satisfaction. No statistically significant differences were found in demographic information between the experimental and control groups. In comparison with the control group, subjects in the experimental group had less anxiety and could better cope with anxiety, had a better self-efficacy and quality of life scores, and had fewer complications. The patients in the experimental group were shown to be more satisfied with the care model. In addition, the most useful and popular service is the online social tools WeChat and QQ, because they can communicate with video, and they are more real-time, efficient, and cheap. The continuous care model of information-based hospital-family integration significantly strengthened patients' self-efficacy and confidence, which decreased colostomy complications, ultimately improving the quality of life.",Photoluminescence Properties of Dy3+ Activated CaWO4 Nanophosphors: a Potential Single Phase near White Light Emitter.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30685830,Journal of fluorescence,2019 05 10,A multicolor tunable CaWO4:xDy3+ nanophosphors have been synthesized via hydrothermal route. X-Ray Diffraction and Fourier transform infrared confirm the formation of CaWO4:Dy3+ nanophosphors. Transmission electron microscopy image and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) reveal the formation of nanosize and crystalline CaWO4:Dy3+. Dependence of energy transfer rate from WO42- to the activator (Dy3+) is observed from the photoluminescence studies. An enhancement of energy transfer efficiency from 36% to 90% is observed after annealing the as-prepared samples at 800 °C. The exchange type energy transfer mechanism is observed to be dominant in as-prepared samples while the electric dipole-dipole interaction is dominant in annealed samples. Variation in energy transfer rate from the host to Dy3+ activator ions leads to the tuning of color emission from this nanophosphor. A near white light emission could be achieved with 6 at.% Dy3+ doped CaWO4 annealed at 800 °C with x = 0.310 and y = 0.327.,"In-depth analysis of the genome of Trypanosoma evansi, an etiologic agent of surra.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30685829,Science China. Life sciences,2019 03 26,"Trypanosoma evansi is the causative agent of the animal trypanosomiasis surra, a disease with serious economic burden worldwide. The availability of the genome of its closely related parasite Trypanosoma brucei allows us to compare their genetic and evolutionarily shared and distinct biological features. The complete genomic sequence of the T. evansi YNB strain was obtained using a combination of genomic and transcriptomic sequencing, de novo assembly, and bioinformatic analysis. The genome size of the T. evansi YNB strain was 35.2 Mb, showing 96.59% similarity in sequence and 88.97% in scaffold alignment with T. brucei. A total of 8,617 protein-coding genes, accounting for 31% of the genome, were predicted. Approximately 1,641 alternative splicing events of 820 genes were identified, with a majority mediated by intron retention, which represented a major difference in post-transcriptional regulation between T. evansi and T. brucei. Disparities in gene copy number of the variant surface glycoprotein, expression site-associated genes, microRNAs, and RNA-binding protein were clearly observed between the two parasites. The results revealed the genomic determinants of T. evansi, which encoded specific biological characteristics that distinguished them from other related trypanosome species.",Advances in research into gamete and embryo-fetal origins of adult diseases.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30685828,Science China. Life sciences,2019 03 26,"The fetal and infant origins of adult disease hypothesis proposed that the roots of adult chronic disease lie in the effects of adverse environments in fetal life and early infancy. In addition to the fetal period, fertilization and early embryonic stages, the critical time windows of epigenetic reprogramming, rapid cell differentiation and organogenesis, are the most sensitive stages to environmental disturbances. Compared with embryo and fetal development, gametogenesis and maturation take decades and are more vulnerable to potential damage for a longer exposure period. Therefore, we should shift the focus of adult disease occurrence and pathogenesis further back to gametogenesis and embryonic development events, which may result in intergenerational, even transgenerational, epigenetic re-programming with transmission of adverse traits and characteristics to offspring. Here, we focus on the research progress relating to diseases that originated from events in the gametes and early embryos and the potential epigenetic mechanisms involved.",Use of Mannitol for Ischemia Reperfusion Injury in Kidney Transplant and Partial Nephrectomies-Review of Literature.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30685826,Current urology reports,2019 03 13,Few procedures involve the ischemia-reperfusion injury to organs purposely.

Currently, Polish Red cattle population is a subject of two independent breeding programs: (i) improvement program and (ii) genetic resources conservation program. The aim of the improvement program is the genetic progress in terms of milk production and body conformation traits, while the conservation program mainly focuses on protection of the genetic resources of Polish Red cattle and preservation of the existing, original gene pool. By the analysis of FST genetic distances across genome-wide SNP panel, we detected diversifying selection signatures among these two subpopulations and indicated (among others) the significance of DGAT1 and FGF2 genes for milk production traits in these cattle. We also found that among genes being presumably under selection in terms of milk production, there are genes responsible, for example, for mammary gland development (e.g., SOSTDC1, PYGO2, MED1, and CCND1) and immune system response (e.g., IL10RA, IL12B, and IL21). The most important finding of this study is that the most pronounced genetic differences between the analyzed populations were associated with β-defensin genes (e.g., DEFB1, DEFB4A, DEFB5, DEFB7, DEFB10, DEFB13, EBD, BNBD-6, and LAP) located within so-called bovine cluster D on BTA27. The β-defensins are expressed mainly in the mammary gland and are antimicrobial peptides against the Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, viruses, and other unicellular parasites. This suggests that antimicrobial resistance of mammary gland is of high importance during selection towards increased milk production and that genes responsible for this process are selected together with increasing levels of productivity."

In this study, we tested the hypothesis that bovine colostrum may influence the intestinal cell surface and in turn the attachment of commensal organisms. Human HT-29 intestinal cells were exposed to a bovine colostrum fraction (BCF) rich in free oligosaccharides. The adherence of several commensal bacteria, comprising mainly bifidobacteria, to the intestinal cells was significantly enhanced (up to 52-fold) for all strains tested which spanned species that are found across the human lifespan. Importantly, the changes to the HT-29 cell surface did not support enhanced adhesion of the enteric pathogens tested. The gene expression profile of the HT-29 cells following treatment with the BCF was evaluated by microarray analysis. Many so called ""glyco-genes"" (glycosyltransferases and genes involved in the complex biosynthetic pathways of glycans) were found to be differentially regulated suggesting modulation of the enzymatic addition of sugars to glycoconjugate proteins. The microarray data was further validated by means of real-time PCR. The current findings provide an insight into how commensal microorganisms colonise the human gut and highlight the potential of colostrum and milk components as functional ingredients that can potentially increase commensal numbers in individuals with lower counts of health-promoting bacteria.",Immobilization of cellulase in the non-natural ionic liquid environments to enhance cellulase activity and functional stability.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30685813,Applied microbiology and biotechnology,2019 04 02,"Ionic liquids (ILs) have been applied as an environmentally friendly solvent in the pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass for more than a decade. The ILs involved pretreatment processes for cellulases mediated saccharification lead to both the breakdown of cellulose crystallinity and the decrease of lignin content, thereby improving the solubility of cellulose and the accessibility of cellulase. However, most cellulases are partially or completely inactivated in the presence of even low amount of ILs. Immobilized cellulases are found to perform improved stability and higher apparent activity in practical application compared with its free counterparts. Enzyme immobilization therefore has become a promising way to relieve the deactivation of cellulase in ILs. Various immobilization carriers and methods have been developed and achieved satisfactory results in improving the stability, activity, and recycling of cellulases in IL pretreatment systems. This review aims to provide detailed introduction of immobilization methods and carrier materials of cellulase, including natural polysaccharides, synthetic polymers, inorganic materials, magnetic materials, and newly developed composite materials, and illustrate key methodologies in improving the performance of cellulase in the presence of ILs. Especially, novel materials and concepts from the recently representative researches are focused and discussed comprehensively, and future trends in immobilization of cellulases in non-natural ILs environments are speculated in the end.",Agronomic and environmental factors affecting cultivation of the winter mushroom or Enokitake: achievements and prospects.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30685812,Applied microbiology and biotechnology,2019 04 02,"The global interest in production of the winter mushroom or Enokitake (Flammulina filiformis previously known as Flammulina velutipes) is increasing owing to its nutritional and medicinally important bioactive compounds along with a marketable texture and flavor. This review presents the state of knowledge on achievements in solid-state cultivation and submerged cultures of Enokitake and how they are influenced by environmental factors and agronomic characteristics. A wide range of basic lignocellulosic substrates and supplementations have been reviewed in order to formulate an efficient and locally available substrate. Domestication of wild types of Enokitake and its economic and research implications are also discussed. Besides, the influence of environmental and agronomic factors on production and efficacy of the most important biologically active metabolites of Enokitake in both solid-state cultivation and submerged cultures has been discussed. Some of shortcomings of studies reporting cultivation of Enokitake are described and their contribution to future prospects is also discussed in this review.",Evaluation and optimization of a methodology for the long-term cryogenic storage of Tetradesmus obliquus at - 80 °C.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30685811,Applied microbiology and biotechnology,2019 03 16,"Cryopreservation is a common methodology for long-term microalgae storage. Current cryopreservation methods are based on using diverse cryoprotectants and two-step cooling protocols, followed by sample storage at the temperature of liquid nitrogen (- 196 °C). However, the use of this methodology requires a continuous liquid N2 supply as well as facilities with dedicated equipment, which is not affordable for every laboratory. In our work, we report on the successful development of a simple and cost-effective method for the long-term cryogenic storage of Tetradesmus obliquus at temperatures (- 80 °C) used in commonly available deep freezers that are more readily accessible to laboratories. Two procedures were evaluated that were originally devised for other microalgae; this was followed by the optimization of critical parameters such as the sample's microalgal concentration and the cryoprotectant reagent's incubation time. Cell viability was monitored using the survival rates obtained by direct agar plating and the growth recovery times in liquid cultures. Viability-related variables were recorded following different storage times of up to 3 years. The main operational factors involved in the process (cell concentration, incubation time, and storage time) were statistically analyzed with regard to their influence on the survival rate. The statistical analysis showed interdependence (a two-factor interaction) between the cellular concentration and the cryoprotectant's incubation time, on the one hand, and between the incubation time and the storage time on the other. Survival rates above 70% were obtained under optimized conditions after 3 months of storage, along with 20-35% viabilities after 3 years. These results open up the possibility of extending this method to other Scenedesmaceae, or even other microalgal species, and for its use in resource-limited laboratories.",The repertoire of effector candidates in Colletotrichum lindemuthianum reveals important information about Colletotrichum genus lifestyle.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30685810,Applied microbiology and biotechnology,2019 03 16,"The fungus Colletotrichum lindemuthianum is the causal agent of anthracnose in the common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris), and anthracnose is one of the most devastating diseases of this plant species. However, little is known about the proteins that are essential for the fungus-plant interactions. Knowledge of the fungus' arsenal of effector proteins is of great importance for understanding this pathosystem. In this work, we analyzed for the first time the arsenal of Colletotrichum lindemuthianum effector candidates (ClECs) and compared them with effector proteins from other species of the genus Colletotrichum, providing a valuable resource for studying the infection mechanisms of these pathogens in their hosts. Isolates of two physiological races (83.501 and 89 A2 2-3) of C. lindemuthianum were used to predict 353 and 349 ClECs, respectively. Of these ClECs, 63% were found to be rich in cysteine, have repetitive sequences of amino acids, and/or possess nuclear localization sequences. Several conserved domains were found between the ClECs. We also applied the effector prediction to nine species in the genus Colletotrichum, and the results ranged from 247 predicted effectors in Colletotrichum graminicola to 446 in Colletotrichum orbiculare. Twelve conserved domains were predicted in the effector candidates of all analyzed species of Colletotrichum. An expression analysis of the eight genes encoding the effector candidates in C. lindemuthianum revealed their induction during the biotrophic phase of the fungus on the bean.",Enhancement of neomycin production by engineering the entire biosynthetic gene cluster and feeding key precursors in Streptomyces fradiae CGMCC 4.576.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30685809,Applied microbiology and biotechnology,2019 03 16,"Neomycin, an aminoglycoside antibiotic, is widely used in the livestock husbandry due to its higher antimicrobial activity and availability of feed additives in animals. However, its production yield is relatively low and cannot meet the needs of developing market and clinical application. Here, the entire natural neo cluster was cloned from Streptomyces fradiae CGMCC 4.576 by φBT1 integrase-mediated site-specific recombination. Then, the rational reconstruction of the neo cluster was performed by using λ-Red-mediated PCR targeting for improving neomycin production. In order to coordinate with this attempt, the supplementation of suitable precursors was carried out. The constructed recombinant strain Sf/pKCZ03 has multi-copy of the neo cluster modified by disrupting the negative regulatory gene neoI and replacing the native promoter of the neoE-D with PkasO*. Compared to the yield (1282 mg/L) of Streptomyces fradiae CGMCC 4.576, the engineered strain Sf/pKCZ03 had a 36% enhancement of neomycin production. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis revealed the increased transcription of structural genes (neoE, neoB, neoL, aacC8) and regulatory genes (neoR, neoH) in Sf/pKCZ03. Additionally, under the supplementation of 1 g/L N-acetyl-D-glucosamine and 5 g/L L-glutamine, the yield of engineered strain Sf/pKCZ03 showed 62% and 107% improvements compared to that of the wild-type strain in the original medium, respectively. These findings demonstrated that engineering the antibiotic gene cluster in combination with precursors feeding was an effective approach for strain improvement, and would be potentially extended to other Streptomyces for large-scale production of commercialized antibiotics.",G-CSF-primed haplo-identical HSCT with intensive immunosuppressive and myelosuppressive treatments does not increase the risk of pre-engraftment bloodstream infection: a multicenter case-control study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30685808,European journal of clinical microbiology & infectious diseases : official publication of the European Society of Clinical Microbiology,2019 04 19,"A multicenter retrospective study in 131 patients (44 females/87 males) with hematological disorders who underwent G-CSF-primed/haplo-identical (Haplo-ID) (n = 76) or HLA-identical (HLA-ID) HSCT (n = 55) from February 2013 to February 2016 was conducted to compare the incidence and risk factors for pre-engraftment bloodstream infection (PE-BSI). In the Haplo-ID group, 71/76 patients with high-risk (n = 28) or relapsed/refractory hematological malignancies (n = 43) received FA5-BUCY conditioning (NCT02328950). All received trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) prophylaxis. Blood cultures and catheter tip cultures were obtained to confirm the BSI. PE-BSI was detected in 24/131 HSCT patients (18/76 in Haplo-ID and 6/55 in HLA-ID) after 28 febrile neutropenic episodes. Among 28 isolates for the 24 patients, 21 (75%) were Gneg bacteria, 6 (21.4%) Gpos and 1 (3.6%) fungi. Bacteria sources were central venous line infection (7/29.2%), gastroenteritis (6/25%), lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI; 5/20.8%), perianal skin infection (4/16.7%), and unknown (2/8.3%). The duration of neutropenia (P = 0.046) and previous Gneg bacteremia (P = 0.037) were important risk factors by univariate analysis, while the type of HSCT was not. A trend of TMP-SMX-resistant BSI in both groups may be due to routine antibacterial prophylaxis strategies. Our data show that G-CSF-primed Haplo-ID HSCT did not increase the risk of PE-BSI, even with intensive immunosuppressive treatments.",Chronic use of oral iron supplements is associated with poor clinical outcomes in patients with gram-negative bacteremia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30685806,European journal of clinical microbiology & infectious diseases : official publication of the European Society of Clinical Microbiology,2019 03 29,"An unabsorbed dietary iron supplementation can modify the colonic microbiota equilibrium and favor the growth of pathogenic strains over barrier strains.

The entire cohort was divided into chronic OIS users (study group) and nonusers (control group). The two groups were compared for the study outcomes, septic shock at presentation, length of hospital stay (LOS), and short-term mortality. The study cohort included 232 patients; 44 patients in the study group and 188 in the control one. There was no any significant difference in demographic and comorbidities characteristics between the two groups. Escherichia coli comprised the majority of bacteria (69%), while the urinary tract was the main source of the bacteremia. OIS alone and after adjustment was significantly associated with septic shock at presentation (OR = 2, CI95% [1.03-5], p = 0.04 and OR = 5, CI95% [1.4-15], p = 0.01, respectively). By multivariate analysis, OIS was significantly associated with 30-day mortality (OR = 3, CI95% [1.05-7], p = 0.04), but had no impact on LOS (16 + 23 vs. 12 + 15, p = 0.9).

This study evaluated the accumulation and translocation of Cd and Hg in a soil-plant system in four tomato plantations and assessed the risk associated with ingestion of these metals. Ten soil samples (rhizosphere) and 10 samples of plant tissues (leaf, ripe fruit, green fruit, and roots) were collected in each plantation. Spatial variation in Cd and Hg concentrations was negligible. The Cd level in rhizosphere was lower in comparison with that of plant tissues. Hg levels in rhizosphere were similar to roots and higher than the value observed in aerial parts of plants. The Cd bioconcentration factor was approximately five times higher compared to that of Hg. Approximately 93% and 48.6% of Cd and Hg accumulated in roots reached aerial parts, respectively. Our results indicate that tomato readily absorbs Cd accumulated in soil, translocating it to aerial parts. Comparatively, the absorption of Hg is not efficient. Levels of Cd in tomatoes were over 17 times higher than the maximum residual levels in 57.5% of ripe fruits and in 27.5% of green tomatoes.",Pollution assessment of potentially toxic elements in soils of different taxonomy orders in central Greece.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30685789,Environmental monitoring and assessment,2019 03 06,"Four hundred fifty soil samples of the orders of Alfisols, Inceptisols, Endisols, and Vertisols from Karditsa, Trikala, and Larissa (Central Greece) were collected over a three-year period. In these samples we analyzed potentially toxic elements (PTEs) and soil properties known to affect their mobility. High regression coefficients were observed between soil pH and PTE concentrations in Alfisols, reflecting that soil pH is the dominant characteristic influencing PTEs. In Inceptisols, there was a significant interaction among the studied PTEs, probably due to PTEs having the same origin. The Endisol samples had high sand content and electrical conductivity values, resulting in high availability of all studied PTEs. In Vertisols, clay content proved to be the most important parameter influencing PTE levels. Factor analysis was also used in order to clarify the possible sources of metals in the studied areas.",Quantifying the effects of a low-ozone event and shallow stratocumulus clouds on ultraviolet erythemal radiation exposure.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30685788,International journal of biometeorology,2019 03 10,"Meteorological and dosimetric ultraviolet (UV) erythemal radiation (UVER) measurements were performed in Didcot, England, on 6 and 7 April 2017.

In addition, a low-ozone event occurred on 7 April characterized by a 34 DU (Dobson Unit) drop in total stratospheric ozone content. Compared to 6 April, the ozone mini-hole caused UVER increases of 2.67 standard erythema dose (SED) for diffuse and 4.32 SED for global radiation characterized by radiation amplification factors (RAF) of 1.62 and 1.52, respectively. The total global UVER dose reductions due to SSC coverage amount to 2.33 SED (6 April) and 2.81 SED (7 April). As innovation the RAF is decomposed into two parts, named cloud ozone factor (COF) and radiation amplification factor based on measured data (RAFm), to quantify the low-ozone event's effect and the SSC influence in independently modifying the UVER doses. Hereby, the weight of each of these two effects acting during the same low-ozone event is expressed by the new COF. In this case, the COF values range between -0.13 and -0.11 for diffuse UVER and -0.03 to -0.07 for the global UV and UV-B parts. A positive COF value (0.18) results for the global UV-A range.","Renal ischemia-reperfusion injury impairs renal calcium, magnesium, and phosphate handling in mice.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30685787,Pflugers Archiv : European journal of physiology,2019 06 10,"Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) levels are elevated in patients with acute kidney injury (AKI). The consequences on renal Ca2+, Mg2+, and Pi regulatory mechanisms are unknown. We hypothesized that renal ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury alters the expression of important renal Ca2+, Mg2+, and Pi transport proteins. I/R injury was induced in male C57BL/6 mice by clamping both renal arteries for 27 min. Mice were investigated 18 h later. The mRNA and protein levels of renal Ca2+, Mg2+, and Pi transport proteins were measured by RT-qPCR and western blot analysis. I/R injury-induced hyperphosphatemia and hypermagnesemia were paralleled by a decrease in glomerular filtration rate and an increase in the fractional excretion of Ca2+, Mg2+, and Pi. I/R injury affected the fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23)-klotho-vitamin D axis by increasing plasma levels of FGF23 and downregulation of renal klotho expression. Plasma levels of PTH and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 were unchanged. Further, downregulation of key genes for paracellular reabsorption of Ca2+ and Mg2+ (claudin (Cldn)2, Cldn10b, Cldn16, Cldn19) and for active transcellular transport of Ca2+, Mg2+, and Pi (calbindin-D28K, Ncx1, Pmca4, Cnnm2, Trpm7, NaPi-2a, and NaPi-2c) was observed. However, renal expression of Trpv5 and Trpv6 was increased. In vitro studies support a direct effect of proinflammatory cytokines on the mRNA expression of Cldn16, Cldn19, and Trpv6. Our findings indicate that renal I/R injury increases FGF23 blood levels independent of PTH and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. This increase is associated with hypermagnesemia, hyperphosphatemia, and increased or decreased expression of specific renal Ca2+, Mg2+, and Pi transporters, respectively.",Surgical management of recurrent urethrovaginal fistula with a skin island flap.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30685786,International urogynecology journal,2019 05 02,"A urethrovaginal fistula is a possible rare complication of tension-free vaginal tape procedures.

This systematic review aimed to provide information about the performance of WSI devices by evaluating intraobserver agreement reported in previously published studies as the best evidence to elucidate whether DM is reliable for primary diagnostic purposes. In addition, this review delineates the reasons for the occurrence of discordant diagnoses. Scopus, MEDLINE/PubMed, and Embase were searched electronically. A total of 13 articles were included. The total sample of 2145 had a majority of 695 (32.4%) cases from dermatopathology, followed by 200 (9.3%) cases from gastrointestinal pathology. Intraobserver agreements showed an excellent concordance, with values ranging from 87% to 98.3% (κ coefficient range 0.8-0.98). Ten studies (77%) reported a total of 128 disagreements. The remaining three studies (23%) did not report the exact number and nature of disagreements. Borderline/challenging cases were the most frequently reported reason for disagreements (53.8%). Six authors reported limitations of the equipment and/or limited image resolution as reasons for the discordant diagnoses. Within these articles, the reported pitfalls were as follows: difficulties in the identification of eosinophilic granular bodies in brain biopsies; eosinophils and nucleated red blood cells; and mitotic figures, nuclear details, and chromatin patterns in neuropathology specimens. The lack of image clarity was reported to be associated with difficulties in the identification of microorganisms (e.g., Candida albicans, Helicobacter pylori, and Giardia lamblia). However, authors stated that the intraobserver variances do not derive from technical limitations of WSI. A lack of clinical information was reported by four authors as a source for disagreements. Two studies (15.4%) reported poor quality of the biopsies, specifically small size of the biopsy material or inadequate routine laboratory processes as reasons for disagreements. One author (7.7%) indicated the lack of immunohistochemistry and special stains as a source for discordance. Furthermore, nine studies (69.2%) did not consider the performance of the digital method-limitations of the equipment, insufficient magnification/limited image resolution-as reasons for disagreements. To summarize the pitfalls of digital pathology practice and better address the root cause of the diagnostic discordance, we suggest a Categorization for Digital Pathology Discrepancies to be used in further validations studies. Among 99 discordances, only 37 (37.3%) had preferred diagnosis rendered by means of WSI. The risk of bias and applicability concerns were judged with the QUADAS-2. Two studies (15.4%) presented an unclear risk of bias in the sample selection domain and 2 (15.4%) presented a high risk of bias in the index test domain. Regarding applicability, all studies included were classified as a low concern in all domains. The included studies were optimally designed to validate WSI for general clinical use, providing evidence with confidence. In general, this systematic review showed a high concordance between diagnoses achieved by using WSI and conventional light microscope (CLM), summarizes difficulties related to specific findings of certain areas of pathology-including dermatopathology, pediatric pathology, neuropathology, and gastrointestinal pathology-and demonstrated that WSI can be used to render primary diagnoses in several subspecialties of human pathology.",ALK-negative anaplastic large cell lymphoma arising in the thrombus of an aortic prosthesis preceeded by clonally related lymphomatoid papulosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30685783,Virchows Archiv : an international journal of pathology,2019 04 27,"We report on a 73-year-old male patient with recurrent thrombosis of his infrarenal aortic prosthesis. Histologically, the thrombus contained cells of an ALK-negative anaplastic large cell T cell lymphoma (ALCL). Imaging studies were negative for other lymphoma manifestations; however, 3 months before, the patient had developed skin lesions consistent with lymphomatoid papulosis type A (LypA) which were clonally related to the ALCL. Due to recurrent thrombosis of larger peripheral arteries with the presence of ALCL cells in the thrombi, the patient is now referred to systemic chemotherapy. We present the first case of ALCL manifesting in the thrombus of an aortic prosthesis. This case shows similarities to the well-established entity of breast implant-associated ALCL and anecdotal reports of ALCL occurring at the site of foreign material implants. These cells show a peculiar propensity to aggregate in vessels and thrombi, known primarily from subtypes of diffuse large B cell lymphomas associated with chronic inflammation.","Molecular detection of Angiostrongylus vasorum in gastropods in Surrey, UK.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30685782,Parasitology research,2019 06 10,"Surrey, a county in southern England, is a hot spot for angiostrongylosis in domestic dogs but there have been no investigations into the intermediate hosts of Angiostrongylus vasorum in this area. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of A. vasorum in gastropods in Guildford, the most populous town in Surrey, and to ascertain which gastropod species can act as intermediate hosts for A. vasorum. Gastropods (n = 97) were sampled in six locations, representing urban, suburban and rural environments, and identified to species based on morphological features. A PCR assay was used to detect A. vasorum DNA in gastropod tissue and the species of infected specimens was confirmed by sequencing of mitochondrial genes. 4.1% (4/97) of sampled gastropods and 9.1% (4/44) of sampled slugs were A. vasorum positive. Infected gastropod species were Arion rufus (n = 3) and Deroceras invadens (n = 1), the first description of the latter species as a potential intermediate host for A. vasorum. Two infected slugs were sampled in urban environments and two in suburban environments. The results demonstrate that there is a risk of transmission of A. vasorum to domestic dogs from the gastropod population in urban and suburban areas of Guildford."

MATERIAL AND METHODS Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was used to detect expression of TRIM55 in tissues samples of HCC patients. Transwell assay was used to study migration and invasion ability of HCC cells. Western blot and immunofluorescence (IF) were used to analyze mechanism of TRIM55 in cell migration and invasion. RESULTS We found TRIM55 was downregulated in HCC tissues and was associated with prognosis of HCC patients. Cox regression analysis showed that TRIM55 was an independent risk factor of prognosis of HCC patients. Overexpression of TRIM55 was associated with lower cell migration and invasion ability, and it led to high expression of E-cadherin and low expression of Vimentin and MMP2. CONCLUSIONS Our study found TRIM55 is an independent factor affecting the prognosis of HCC patients, and overexpression of TRIM55 inhibits migration and invasion of HCC cells through epithelial-mesenchymal transition and MMP2.",Surgical Management of Undescended Testis - Timetable and Outcome: A Debate.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30685766,"Sexual development : genetics, molecular biology, evolution, endocrinology, embryology, and pathology of sex determination and differentiation",2019 04 22,"Around 1.4-3.8% of boys in the Western world are operated because of cryptorchidism. This means that orchidopexy remains one of the most common surgical procedures performed in boys. As a consequence, several consensus reports, guidelines, and reviews dealing with the management of cryptorchidism have been published recently. Based on our research and 30 years' experience with the management of cryptorchidism, the intention of the present publication is to advise on the surgical management and comment on the expected outcome, especially with focus on the controversies related to guidelines and reviews. Except for late referral and waiting lists, which may be practical problems, there is no reason to postpone orchidopexy for nonsyndromic congenital cryptorchid testes beyond 6 months. There is good evidence that such strategy improves the fertility potential and decreases the risk of testicular cancer. In cases with genuine gonadotropin insufficiency, early surgical correction is not enough and adjuvant LH-RH treatment should be implemented to improve the fertility potential. Cryopreservation may be an option in case of treatment failure of adjuvant LH-RH. A prerequisite for such management includes serum hormone assessment and evaluation of testicular biopsies at orchidopexy. Ascended testes contribute to 20-60% of operative cases and should be treated when diagnosed.","Early Palliative Care: Pro, but Please Be Precise!",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30685764,Oncology research and treatment,2019 02 05,"By definition, palliative care (PC) is applicable already in early stages of incurable and life-threatening diseases, in conjunction with therapies that are intended to prolong life, such as for example chemo- or radiotherapy. Many patients suffer from distressing symptoms or problems in early phases of such illness. Therefore, it is not a question of ""if"" PC should be integrated early into oncology, but ""how."" General PC is defined as an approach that should be delivered by healthcare professionals regardless of their discipline. This is often referred to as ""general"" or ""primary"" PC. For this, routine symptom assessment, expertise concerning basic symptom management, and communication skills are basic requirements. Communication skills include the willingness to engage in discussions concerning patients' fears, worries and end-of-life issues without the fear of destroying hope. Specialist PC is provided by specialist teams regardless of the patients' disease, be it cancer or non-cancer. Such teams should be integrated in the care of PC patients depending on the availability of these services and the patients' needs. Key messages: ""Early PC"" must not be used synonymously with ""early specialist PC"" because much of the PC is delivered as basic oncology PC. For the integration of specialist PC, the identification of triggers is warranted in different institutions to facilitate a meaningful and effective cooperation. Such cooperations should be based on patients' needs, but must also account for questions of availability and resources.",tRNA-DL: A Deep Learning Approach to Improve tRNAscan-SE Prediction Results.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30685762,Human heredity,2019 06 07,"tRNAscan-SE is the leading tool for transfer RNA (tRNA) annotation, which has been widely used in the field.

Among amniotes, squamates (lizards and snakes) - and gecko lizards in particular - are worthy of additional study. Geckos possess all major vertebrate sex-determining systems, as well as multiple transitions among them, yet we still lack data on the sex-determining systems for the vast majority of species. We here utilize restriction-site associated DNA sequencing (RADseq) to identify the sex chromosome system of the Puerto Rican endemic leaf-toed gecko (Phyllodactylidae: Phyllodactylus wirshingi), in order to confirm a ZZ/ZW sex chromosome system within the genus, as well as to better categorize the diversity within this poorly characterized family. RADseq has proven an effective alternative to cytogenetic methods for determining whether a species has an XX/XY or ZZ/ZW sex chromosome system - particularly in taxa with non-differentiated sex chromosomes - but can also be used to identify which chromosomes in the genome are the sex chromosomes. We here identify a ZZ/ZW sex chromosome system in P. wirshingi. Furthermore, we show that 4 of the female-specific markers contain fragments of genes found on the avian Z and discuss homology with P. wirshingi sex chromosomes.",Maternal Hematological Parameters and Placental and Umbilical Cord Histopathology in Intrauterine Growth Restriction.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30685759,"Medical principles and practice : international journal of the Kuwait University, Health Science Centre",2019 06 13,To investigate the placental and umbilical cord histopathology in intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and their relation to second-trimester maternal hematological parameters.,"Pre-tertiary education, ethnicity, and attitudes of Asian medical undergraduates towards communication skills.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30685752,International journal of medical education,2019 03 06,This study was aimed at determining whether the pre-tertiary education system and ethnicity have any association with the attitudes of medical undergraduates towards communication skills.

This paper investigated the contribution of intrinsic reasons for consumption-based GHG emissions growth using structural decomposition analysis based on world input-output database from 1995 to 2009. The drivers are decomposed into five sub-effects at both country-level and industry-level. The results are as follows: (1) The rapid global economic growth is the dominating driving force. However, a decreasing emission intensity caused by the improvement of energy efficiency and technology innovation can contribute significantly to emission reduction; (2) Key factors contributing to GHG emissions vary in different country groups. The investment effects in developing countries are overwhelming those in developed countries. Instead, the net export effects in developed countries are greater than them in developing countries, which means that developing countries are becoming pollution haven; (3) China and India are still the key contributors of CO2 growth and CH4 growth. In developing countries, the total effects of N2O emissions changes are positive, which is mainly because agriculture plays an important role in these countries; (4) Cluster analysis depicts the relationship between growth of GHG emissions and gross domestic outputs in different countries.",Protein-driven nanomedicines in oncotherapy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30685732,Current opinion in pharmacology,2019 05 07,"Proteins are organic macromolecules essential in life but exploited, mainly in recombinant versions, as drugs or vaccine components, among other uses in industry or biomedicine.

This study examined future thinking as self-reported by dysphoric (n = 79; probable major depression on the Patient Health Questionnaire and very or extremely difficult impact on functioning) and non-dysphoric adults (n = 79; as defined by normal range on the PHQ) that were matched on age and gender. The dysphoric group reported more frequent thoughts about their future in general, particularly for the long-term future, which persisted after controlling for emotional-valence. Dysphoric individuals perceived their future thinking as being more frequently vivid and detailed, more often involving mental imagery and inner speech, more often involuntary, more often unrealistic or implausible, more negatively-valenced, and more often from a third-person perspective. The findings indicate differences in the phenomenology of thinking about one's future among dysphoric individuals, some of which contrast with prior research findings. The implications for understanding autobiographical future thinking in depression are discussed, and studies are indicated to further clarify the content, function, and context of future thinking in altered affective states.",Circulating biomarkers to identify cardiometabolic complications in patients with Obstructive Sleep Apnea: A systematic review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30685729,Sleep medicine reviews,2019 06 13,"Untreated Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is associated with an increased risk of cardiometabolic diseases such as diabetes and myocardial infarction. However, it is difficult to predict which patients are at particularly high risk. This systematic review aimed to identify potentially useful circulating biomarkers that could predict cardiometabolic complications in OSA. We searched Cochrane (EBM), EMBASE, Medline, PubMed, and Web of Science databases. Search concepts included: ""Obstructive Sleep Apnea"", ""Biomarkers"" and ""Risk-Stratification"". Manuscripts were included if they studied adults with OSA, circulating (blood) markers, and relationships with clinical outcomes. After screening, 10 were included. Studies addressed cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, end-stage renal disease and metabolic syndrome. In general, levels of inflammatory markers, adhesion molecules, and vascular proteins were associated with the presence of cardiometabolic disease in OSA patients. Although studies regarding prognostic circulating biomarkers in OSA are limited, a number of potentially promising biomarkers were identified in our review. However, more research is needed using prospective cohorts to determine which biomarkers are most robustly associated with and useful in predicting future cardiovascular and metabolic sequelae in OSA patients.

A ball-on-3-specimen wear tester in a tetrahedral configuration with a rotating hard antagonist zirconia sphere is used to produce circular wear scars on polished surfaces of dental materials in artificial saliva. Images of the wear scars enable interpretation of wear mechanisms, and measurements of scar dimensions quantify wear rates. Rates are lowest for zirconia ceramics, highest for lithium disilicate, with feldspathic ceramic and ceramic-polymer composite intermediate. Examination of wear scars reveals surface debris, indicative of a mechanism of material removal at the microstructural level. Microplasticity and microcracking models account for mild and severe wear regions. Wear models are used to evaluate potential longevity for each dental material. It is demonstrated that controlled laboratory testing can identify and quantify wear susceptibility under conditions that reflect the essence of basic occlusal contact. In addition to causing severe material loss, wear damage can lead to premature tooth or prosthetic failure.",Friction in the contact between skin and a soft counter material: Effects of hardness and surface finish.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30685727,Journal of the mechanical behavior of biomedical materials,2019 02 24,"The interaction behaviour of skin with a counter surface depends strongly on the surface roughness of the counter surface. For relatively hard surfaces this effect is described in various literature, but for soft, or compliant, materials this is much less studied. Inside the contact, the protuberances on the surface will deform substantially. In order to gain insights into the effect of surface roughness and hardness on the frictional behaviour between skin and a soft counter surface a range of experiments were performed using artificial skin and various silicone compounds which are commonly used in medical devices that interact with the human skin. Using these results, a 'friction map' was created that shows the friction behaviour as a function of the elastic modulus and the surface roughness. When the surface roughness is increased the friction coefficient decreases due to the reduction in the real area of contact, which weakens the adhesion between the two surfaces. A minimum coefficient of friction was observed at a surface roughness of approximately 4 µm. For the softest compounds tested there was minimal effect of surface roughness on friction because the roughness protuberances inside the contact will be flattened. Silicone compounds with increased hardness showed a larger sensitivity of the friction to the surface roughness, because these harder surface roughness protuberances are more resistant against deformation. The friction map provides a tool when designing products that require certain frictional properties: for products that are required to adhere to skin a smooth and soft material is recommended, whereas for products that require a low coefficient of friction a harder compound with a surface roughness of approximately 4 µm is recommended.",Shape recovery strain and nanostructures on recovered polyurethane films and their regulation to osteoblasts morphology.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30685726,Journal of the mechanical behavior of biomedical materials,2019 02 24,"Shape memory polyurethanes (SMPUs) have emerged as novel dynamic substrates to regulate cell alignment, in which recovery-induced change in substrates topography has been described as the major contributor. This work, for the first time, confirmed the pivotal roles of recovery strain and phase-separated nanostructures of SMPUs in regulating cell morphology. SMPU films with different stretching ratios (0%, 50%, 100%, and 200%) were found to produce an average recovery strain from 19.41% to 34.04% within 2 h in dulbecco's modified eagle medium (DMEM). Meanwhile, the assembly of hard domains was enhanced during shape recovery, leading to the reorientation of fibrillar apophyses (i.e., nanostructures). Further observation of osteoblast morphology revealed that recovery strain resulted in perpendicular orientation of osteoblasts to strain direction. With the extension of incubation time (24 h), however, the perpendicular orientation was transformed to follow the nanostructures on recovered films, suggesting that the nanostructures might become the determinant of the long-term cell orientation. This study provides a biomechanics-based perspective to understand the dynamic interactions between SMPU and cells, which can help to guide the design of SMPU for specific biomedical applications."

One approach is searching for compounds that influence pluripotent stem cell reprogramming using functional screens of known drugs. Our high-throughput screening of drug-like hits showed that imidazopyridines-analogs of zolpidem, a sedative-hypnotic drug-are able to improve reprogramming efficiency and facilitate reprogramming of resistant human primary fibroblasts. The lead compound (O4I3) showed a remarkable OCT4 induction, which at least in part is due to the inhibition of H3K4 demethylase (KDM5, also known as JARID1). Experiments demonstrated that KDM5A, but not its homolog KDM5B, serves as a reprogramming barrier by interfering with the enrichment of H3K4Me3 at the OCT4 promoter. Thus our results introduce a new class of KDM5 chemical inhibitors and provide further insight into the pluripotency-related properties of KDM5 family members.",Succession Patterns and Physical Niche Partitioning in Microbial Communities from Subsurface Coal Seams.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30685711,iScience,2019 02 28,"The subsurface represents a largely unexplored frontier in microbiology. Here, coal seams present something of an oasis for microbial life, providing moisture, warmth, and abundant fossilized organic material. Microbes in coal seams are thought to syntrophically mobilize fossilized carbon from the geosphere to the biosphere. Despite the environmental and economic importance of this process, little is known about the microbial ecology of coal seams. In the current study, ecological succession and spatial niche partitioning are explored in three coal seam microbial communities. Scanning electron microscopic visualization and 16S rRNA sequencing track changes in microbial communities over time, revealing distinct attached and planktonic communities displaying patterns of ecological succession. Attachment to the coal surface is biofilm mediated on Surat coal, whereas microbes on Sydney and Gunnedah coal show different attachment processes. This study demonstrates that coal seam microbial communities undergo spatial niche partitioning during periods of succession as microbes colonize coal environments.",Rudolf Hess - The Doppelgänger conspiracy theory disproved.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30685710,Forensic science international. Genetics,2019 04 25,"The Deputy Führer of the Third Reich Rudolf Hess was captured after a controversial flight to Scotland in 1941. Hess was sentenced to life imprisonment during the Nuremberg War Crimes Trials. He was detained in Berlin's Spandau Prison under the official security designation 'Spandau #7.' Early doubts arose about the true identity of prisoner 'Spandau #7.' This evolved to a frequently espoused conspiracy theory that prisoner 'Spandau #7' was an imposter and not Rudolf Hess. After Hess's reputed 1987 suicide, the family grave became a Neo-Nazi pilgrimage site. In 2011, the grave was abandoned and the family remains cremated. Here we report the forensic DNA analysis of the only known extant DNA sample from prisoner 'Spandau #7' and a match to the Hess male line, thereby refuting the Doppelgänger Theory.",Intracellular ion and protein nanoparticle-induced osmotic pressure modify astrocyte swelling and brain edema in response to glutamate stimuli.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30685709,Redox biology,2019 04 01,"Intracellular tension activity plays a crucial role in cytotoxic brain edema and astrocyte swelling. Here, a few genetically encoded FRET-based tension probes were designed to detect cytoskeletal structural tension optically, including their magnitude and vectors. The astrocyte swelling resulted in GFAP tension increment, which is associated with the antagonistic effect of inward microfilaments (MFs) and microtubules (MTs) forces. In glutamate-induced astrocyte swelling, GFAP tension rise resulted from outward ion and protein nanoparticle-induced osmotic pressure (PN-OP) increases, where PN-OP could be elicited by MF and MT depolymerization, protein nanoparticle production, and activation of cofilin and stathmin-1. Attenuation of both ion osmotic pressure and PN-OP by drug combinations, together with free-radical scavenger, relieved cerebral edema in vivo. The study suggests that intracellular osmotic pressure (especially PN-OP) has a pivotal role in glutamate-induced astrocyte swelling and brain edema. Recovery of cytoplasmic potential is a promising target to develop new drugs and cure brain edema.","The combined influence of the own-age, -gender, and -ethnicity biases on face recognition.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30685708,Acta psychologica,2019 05 08,"Whether the own-group (own-ethnicity, own-gender, and own-age) biases in face recognition are based on the same mechanism and whether their effects are additive or not are as yet unanswered questions.

Result showed that while face recognition accuracy decreased as the number of out-group features increased, the own-ethnicity bias appeared to have more of a unique influence on face recognition than the other biases. Furthermore, we established that in a single group of participants, these biases appear to be based on different mechanisms: the own-ethnicity bias is based on individuation whereas the own-age and own-gender biases are based on motivation.",Exploiting electrostatic shielding-effect of metal nanoparticles to recognize uncharged small molecule affinity with label-free graphene electronic biosensor.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30685707,Biosensors & bioelectronics,2019 02 09,"Label-free electronic biosensors as the non-electrochemical analytical tools without requirement of sophisticated instrumentation have become attractive, although their application in competitive affinity sensing of uncharged small molecules is still ﻿hindered by a difficulty in the development of competing analogues. To break through this bottleneck, we report a novel analogue made by epitope-modified metal nanoparticles to enable the electronic signaling of small-molecule analyte recognition via competitive affinity. While the electronic signaling capability of metal nanoparticle analogues is demonstrated by a graphene field-effect transistor bioassay of small-molecule glucose as a proof-of-principle, interestingly, we discover a new electronic signaling mechanism in the metal nanoparticle affinity, different to the intuitive charge accumulation expectation. On the basis of Kelvin-probe force microscopic potential characterization and theoretical discussion, we fundamentally elucidated the signaling mechanism as a seldom used electrostatic shielding-effect, that is, in the analogue-receptor affinity, metal nanoparticles with the charge density lower than receptor biomolecules can reduce the collective electrical potential via charge dispersion. Further consider the convenient epitope-modifiability of metal nanoparticles, the easy-to-develop analogues for diverse target analyte might potentially be predictable in the future. And the application of label-free electronic biosensors for the competitive affinity bioassay of range-extended small molecules may thus be promoted based on the electrostatic shielding-effect.",Optical fiber amplifier for quantitative and sensitive point-of-care testing of myoglobin and miRNA-141.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30685706,Biosensors & bioelectronics,2019 02 09,"A simple, sensitive, quantitative point-of-care testing (POCT) was developed integrating enzyme-linked DNA supersandwich amplification with optical fiber amplifier.

More importantly, the optical fiber amplifier, which was used as signal readout, exhibited low-cost, small size, rapid response, and easy operation. Although it did not need large equipment and professional technical personnel, the assay was successfully applied to detect Myo and miRNA-141 in 40% human serum.

Herein, we propose a spectral-optical-tweezer-assisted fluorescence multiplexing system to analyze biomolecule-conjugated bead-array. Using optical tweezer, we trapped and locked beads at the focus to accept stimulation, offering a stable and optimized analysis condition. Moving the system focus and scanning the sample slide, we achieved emissions collection to QDs-encoded bead-array after the multiplexed detection. The emission spectra of fluorescence were collected and recorded by the spectrometer. By recognizing locations of decoding peaks and counting the intensities of label signals of emission spectra, we achieved qualitative and quantitative detection to targets. As proof-of-concept studies, we use this system to carry out multiplexed detection to various types of anti-IgG in the single sample and the detection limit reaches 1.52 pM with a linear range from 0.31 to 10 nM. Through further optimization of experimental conditions, we achieved specific detection to target IgG with sandwich method in human serum and the detection limit reaches as low as 0.23 pM with a linear range from 0.88 to 28 pM, validating the practical application of this method in real samples.",Electrochemiluminecence nanogears aptasensor based on MIL-53(Fe)@CdS for multiplexed detection of kanamycin and neomycin.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30685704,Biosensors & bioelectronics,2019 02 09,"A dual gears electrochemiluminecence (ECL) aptasensing strategy for multiple selective determination of kanamycin and neocycin was designed on the basis of the combination of kanamycin and neocycin induced dual gears conversion, the loading platform of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and ECL resonance energy transfer (ERET) between CdS QDs and AuNPs (or PtNPs). In the absence of target, the dual gears were ""off"". Then the B1-AuNP (gear B) and aptamer 1-PtNPs acted as signal quenching elements to quench ECL intensity due to ERET process.

The study was conducted on four grass-based seasonal calving dairy herds in Ireland. The total number of cows in the herds was 2112, of which 488 were diagnosed as anoestrus based on absence of behavioural oestrus during a 30 day period. Ovarian structures and the uterus were examined by transrectal ultrasound on all 488 presumptive anestrus cows 9 days before mating start date (MSD). The number of corpora lutea (CL), number of large follicles (≥10 mm) and uterine reproductive tract score were recorded. Only cows that had no CL, ultrasound reproductive tract score ≤2 and were ≥30 days in milk (DIM) were enrolled in the study (n = 214). Cows were blocked by parity, DIM and body condition score and randomly assigned to one of four treatments: i.m. injection of gonadotropin releasing hormone analogue [GnRH; (n = 57)], i.m. injection of human chorionic gonadotropin [hCG; (n = 48)], 7-day Progesterone-Ovsynch protocol [P4OV; (n = 60)] and Control (no hormonal intervention, n = 49). A second ultrasound examination was performed 7 days after treatment to determine ovulatory response. There was a treatment effect on ovulation rate (P < 0.0001), whereby Control cows had a lesser ovulation rate compared with GnRH-, hCG- and P4OV-treated cows. Submission rate during the first 21 days of the breeding period [SR21; (P = 0.74)], pregnant to first service [P/AI1; (P = 0.24)], pregnant within 42 days after the onset of breeding [P42; (P = 0.73)], and pregnant within 84 days after the onset of breeding were not affected by treatment. A tendency was observed (P = 0.07) for greater likelihood of pregnancy within 21 days after the onset of breeding (P21) for P4OV and Control cows compared with GnRH- and hCG-treated cows. GnRH- and hCG-treated cows tended (P = 0.10) to have greater P/AI1 when first service events occurred after day 21 of the breeding period compared with Control cows. P4OV cows had shorter MSD to first service interval (P = 0.0001) and shorter MSD to conception interval (P = 0.02) compared with Control, GnRH- and hCG-treated cows. In conclusion, treatment of anestrous cows with GnRH or hCG resulted in an increase in ovulation rate compared with untreated Control cows, but did not improve reproductive performance during the first 21 days of the breeding season. The best reproductive performance results were obtained with the P4OV treatment, but this treatment has the greatest cost, and has the greatest number of interventions. The observation of good P/AI1 in hCG- and GnRH- treated cows when the first insemination occurred later than day 21 after MSD warrants further investigation, and suggests that these interventions should be applied earlier than 9 days before the farm MSD.",Morphological changes in the porcine cervix: A comparison between nulliparous and multiparous sows with regard to post-cervical artificial insemination.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30685687,Theriogenology,2019 02 21,"In recent decades, new artificial insemination (AI) methods, such as post-cervical AI (PCAI), have been developed in pig. PCAI involves crossing the cervix to deposit the sperm in the uterine body. Although PCAI application in sows is frequent, its application in nulliparous (gilts) females it is still limited due to the difficulty of passing through the cranial part of the cervical lumen. We hypothesized that ageing and parity would modify the cervical canal, facilitating the introduction of AI devices through the cervix. The aim was to compare the morphology of the uterus at different levels between multiparous and nulliparous females. Morphological analysis of the uterus pointed to a longer cervix (25.9 ± 4.6 vs. 21.6 ± 3.3 cm, p < 0.001) and greater length of the part of the reproductive tract involved in PCAI (from rima vulvae to the last cervical cushion) (56.2 ± 6.0 vs. 50.3 ± 5.2 cm, p < 0.001) in multiparous sows compared with nulliparous animals. As regards the structure of the vaginal and uterine parts of the cervix (the part in contact with the vagina and uterine body, respectively), the cross-sectional area, perimeter and total thickness were greater in the uterine part of multiparous than of nulliparous animals (area: 4.07 ± 1.46 vs. 2.46 ± 0.56 cm2, p < 0.01; perimeter: 8.50 ± 1.44 cm vs. 6.28 ± 0.92 cm, p < 0.001; thickness: 10.79 ± 0.96 vs. 8.35 ± 0.62 mm, p < 0.05), but not in the vaginal part. The tissue content analysed in histological cross-sections also showed differences between female groups, a greater content of connective tissue (58.86 ± 10.78 vs. 67.60 ± 13.38%, p < 0.001) and a lower amount of muscle fibres (39.79 ± 10.24 vs. 30.66 ± 13.69%, p < 0.001) being observed in multiparous sows. Finally, silicone casts of the cervical lumen revealed differences between the two groups in the size and shape of the ridges in the lumen trajectory. Parity, which is also influenced by ageing, determines important changes in the size, structure and tissue content of the cervix wall, as well as in the morphology of the cervical canal, which may be responsible for the different levels of performance of PCAI in the female populations. Therefore, the future design of AI strategies and catheters should take into consideration the morphological variations of the cervix lumen, which will depend on age and parity of the females.",Changes in anti-Müllerian hormone concentrations in bitches throughout the oestrous cycle.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30685686,Theriogenology,2019 02 21,"Studies in female dogs proved the measurement of anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) as a diagnostic tool to distinguish ovarioectomized from intact females or to diagnose ovarian remnant syndrome. Furthermore, its usability to diagnose a granulosa cell tumour and predict litter size was also investigated in female dogs. Although serum AMH was previously shown to increase during the transition from anoestrus to pro-oestrus in dogs, changes in AMH concentration over the entire oestrous cycle have not yet been determined. The aim of this study was to investigate the secretion pattern of AMH throughout the oestrous cycle in non-pregnant bitches. As a preliminary step, we tested our assay by measuring AMH concentrations in serum samples of 19 intact bitches (10 in anoestrus, 3 in pro-oestrus, 3 in oestrus, 3 in metoestrus) and 19 spayed females of different age and breed. For the main study, 20 healthy female dogs were examined (10 Beagles, and 10 Labrador crossbreeds, body weight 10-28 kg, age 1-6 years) during a normal oestrous cycle. Serum samples were collected in late anoestrus, at several times during pro-oestrus and oestrus, as well as 28 days and 4.5 months after ovulation. Blood collection was combined with a gynaecological examination including progesterone measurement. Serum concentration of AMH was determined using a chemiluminescence immunoassay validated for dog serum. In the preliminary test, intact bitches in various stages of the oestrous cycle had significantly higher serum AMH levels (0.19-1.45 ng/ml) than spayed females (0.01-0.06 ng/ml, P < 0.001). In cycling Beagle and Labrador crossbreed bitches participating in our main study, AMH concentrations were between 0.09 and 2.65 ng/ml with higher AMH concentrations in Beagles but overall high inter-individual and intra-individual variation. The highest AMH values were reached in the last three weeks before the onset of heat until six days before ovulation, and the lowest AMH concentrations were recorded during preovulatory oestrus in 6, metoestrus in 7 or anoestrus in 7 dogs. Serum AMH concentrations increased significantly from late anoestrus up to six days before ovulation and decreased significantly over the last three days before ovulation. A further significant decrease occurred from the last days of oestrus to metoestrus and mid anoestrus. This study shows that the used AMH assay can clearly distinguish between intact and spayed females and that the serum AMH pattern over the oestrous cycle is similar in all bitches, but with high variation among the breeds and among and within bitches. These changes in the AMH concentration are a challenge in timing serum sample collection and interpreting AMH values in bitches. Further studies are necessary to emphasize the factors influencing the AMH concentration.",Survival and prognosis with osteosarcoma: outcomes in more than 2000 patients in the EURAMOS-1 (European and American Osteosarcoma Study) cohort.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30685685,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",2019 05 14,High-grade osteosarcoma is a primary malignant bone tumour mainly affecting children and young adults.

A hallmark of these disorders is an imbalance between behavioral approach and avoidance in situations with approach-avoidance conflicts and unclear outcomes. However, if and how stress affects human behavior in approach-avoidance conflicts is largely unknown. To investigate the effects of stress on approach-avoidance behavior, 80 participants underwent a stress or control manipulation before performing an approach-avoidance conflict task. Stress markedly increased behavioral inhibition when threats were distant and accelerated responses when threats were close; suggesting that stress amplifies the importance of threat distance. However, participants high in trait aggression showed increased approach behavior, particularly when stressed. These findings indicate that stress generally leads to enhanced avoidance, but induces approach in individuals prone to aggression, with important implications for stress-related psychopathologies.","Formation of novel disinfection by-products chlorinated benzoquinone, phenyl benzoquinones and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons during chlorination treatment on UV filter 2,4-dihydroxybenzophenone in swimming pool water.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30685680,Journal of hazardous materials,2019 02 08,"2,4-Dihydroxybenzophenone (BP-1) is an important component and metabolite of benzophenone-type (BPs) UV filters, it is widely used in commercial products and frequently detected in environmental media and organism samples. The transformation characteristics and genotoxicity changes of BP-1 during chlorination disinfection process were explored. Nineteen transformation products were separated and tentatively identified, eleven of which were not previously reported. Most importantly, nine novel by-products including one chlorobenzoquinone, four phenyl benzoquinones, and four polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were formed during BP-1 chlorination. Plausible transformation pathways for BP-1 during chlorination treatment were proposed, in which chlorination substitution, Baeyer-Villiger oxidation, hydrolysis, and CC coupling reactions were involved. The CC coupling reaction is firstly observed in chlorination disinfection system. Higher pH values and chlorine doses would be a benefit for BP-1 transformation. The genotoxicity of the reaction mixture increased significantly with increasing chlorine dose under acid and neutral conditions due to the formation of benzoquinones and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. It was noted that BP-1 and its chlorinated products were found in swimming pool water samples. This work inferred that BP-1 and its analogs are transformed during the chlorination disinfection process and may cause potential ecological and health risks."

However, few studies have been conducted on the acute effects of exposure to sunlight on the onset of these disease. The aim of this study was to evaluate the exposure-response relationship between sunshine duration and the hospital admissions for schizophrenia. We obtained data on hospital admissions for schizophrenia from the largest psychiatric hospital in Ningbo, China, during 2012-2016. A Distributed lag non-linear model was used to estimate the exposure-lag-response relationship between sunlight and schizophrenia. We calculated the effects of short and long sunshine duration, defined using the cutoffs at the 1st and 99th sunshine duration percentiles. We detected significant and non-linear associations between sunlight and schizophrenia, and the overall estimated relative risk (RR) for a lag of 0-21 days was 1.45 (95% CI: 1.07, 1.97) and 1.41(95% CI: 0.72, 2.75) for short and long sunshine duration, respectively. The burden of schizophrenia was greater during periods with short sunshine duration than during periods with long sunshine duration, with the AFs of 19.94% (95% CI: 8.65%, 28.24%) and 2.12% (95% CI: -2.70%, 5.57%), respectively. The female and people more than 45 years old were most susceptible to these effects. We repeated our analysis by using global solar radiation as a continuous exposure variable of sunlight intensity in the model, and the result shows that the female and middle-aged and eldly patients were also susceptible to the effects of low levels of global solar radiation. Our findings suggest that there may be a relationship between lack of exposure to sunlight and increased risk of hospital admissions for schizophrenia. Policymakers and doctors should promote further understanding of the health benefits of sunlight and take effective measures to prevent schizophrenia.",Linear and nonlinear partition of nonionic organic compounds into resin ADS-21 from water.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30685668,"Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)",2019 03 27,"The predominance of natural organic matter (NOM) in nonlinear sorption of nonionic organic compounds (NOCs) is a fundamental behavior that controlling the fate, transfer and bioavailability of NOCs in natural environment. There is a debate, i.e., whether the nonlinear sorption is captured by nonlinear partition mechanism or adsorption mechanism. The debate has been going on for decades because characteristics of nonlinear partition are still unknown due to the lack of an adsorbent that can partition NOCs nonlinearly. We find a resin ADS-21, with specific surface area undetectable (<0.5 m2 g-1) but high sorption capacity for NOCs (up to 1000 mg g-1 for phenol as an example), is an ideal adsorbent for examining characteristics of nonlinear partitioning. This resin has nonlinear isotherms for phenols and anilines but linear isotherms for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and nitrobenzenes. The observed positively linear relationship of sorption capacities of NOCs with NOCs solubility in water or octanol, could be one of the characteristics of nonlinear partition. Moreover, competitive sorption and no desorption hysteresis could be observed for the nonlinear partition. Hydrogen-bonding of phenols and anilines with ADS-21 is responsible for nonlinear partition, competitive sorption and isotherm nonlinearity. These evidences would be supportive for understanding nonlinear partition and the nonlinear sorption of NOCs by NOM.",Nanotechnology in remediation of water contaminated by poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances: A review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30685667,"Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)",2019 03 27,"This article gives an overview of nanotechnologies applied in remediation of water contaminated by poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs). The use of engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) in physical sorption and photochemical reactions offers a promising solution in PFAS removal because of the high surface area and the associated high reactivities of the ENMs. Modification of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) (e.g., oxidation, applying electrochemical assistance) significantly improves their adsorption rate and capacity for PFASs removal and opens a new door for use of CNTs in environmental remediation. Modified nanosized iron oxides with high adsorption capacity and magnetic property have also been demonstrated to be ideal sorbents for PFASs with great recyclability and thus provide an excellent alternative for PFAS removal under various conditions. Literature shows that PFOA, which is one of the most common PFASs detected at contaminated sites, can be effectively decomposed in the presence of either TiO2-based, Ga2O3-based, or In2O3-based nano-photocatalysts under UV irradiation. The decomposition abilities and mechanisms of different nano-photocatalysts are reviewed and compared in this paper. Particularly, the nanosized In2O3 photocatalysts have the best potential in PFOA decomposition and the decomposition performance is closely related to the specific surface area and the amount of photogenerated holes on the surfaces of In2O3 nanostructures. In addition to detailed review of the published studies, future prospects of using nanotechnology for PFAS remediation are also discussed in this article.",Is soil contamination by a glyphosate commercial formulation truly harmless to non-target plants? - Evaluation of oxidative damage and antioxidant responses in tomato.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30685666,"Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)",2019 03 27,"Using a realistic and environmental relevant approach, the present study aimed at understanding the biochemical and physiological basis of glyphosate (GLY)-induced stress in non-target plant species, using tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) as a model. For this purpose, plants were grown for 28 days under different concentrations of a commercial formulation of GLY (Roundup® UltraMax) - 0, 10, 20 and 30 mg kg-1 soil. The exposure of plants to increasing concentrations of GLY caused a severe inhibition of growth (root and shoot elongation and fresh weight), especially in the highest treatments. In what regards the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), both hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and superoxide anion (O2.-) remained unchanged in shoots, but significantly increased in roots. Moreover, a concentration-dependent decrease in lipid peroxidation (LP) was found in shoots, though in roots differences were only found for the highest concentration of GLY. The evaluation of the antioxidant system showed that GLY interfered with several antioxidant metabolites (proline, ascorbate and glutathione) and enzyme activities (superoxide dismutase - SOD; catalase - CAT; ascorbate peroxidase - APX), generally inducing a positive response of the defense mechanisms. Overall, data obtained in this study unequivocally demonstrated that soil contamination by GLY, applied as part of its commercial formulation Roundup® UltraMax, impairs the growth and physiological performance of tomato plants, and likely of other non-target plant species, after 28 days of exposure by clearly affecting the normal redox homeostasis.",Degradation of tetra- and trichloroethylene under iron reducing conditions by Acidimicrobiaceae sp. A6.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30685665,"Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)",2019 03 27,"The degradation of trichloroethylene (TCE) and tetrachloroethylene (PCE), in incubations where ammonium was oxidized while iron was being reduced indicates that these compounds can be degraded during the Feammox process by Acidimicrobiaceae sp. A6 (ATCC, PTA-122488). None of these compounds were degraded in incubations to which no ammonium was added, indicating that they were degraded during the oxidation of ammonium. Degradation of TCE and PCE (ranging between 32% and 55%) was observed in incubations with a pure Acidimicrobiaceae sp. A6 culture as well as an Acidimicrobiaceae sp. A6 enrichment culture over a 2-week period. In addition to these batch studies, a column study, with a 5-h hydraulic residence time, was conducted contrasting the degradation of TCE in iron-rich soil columns that were either seeded with a pure or an enrichment culture of Acidimicrobiaceae sp. A6 to achieve ammonium oxidation under iron reduction, and a control column that was initially not seeded and later seeded with Geobacter metallireducens. While there was ∼22% TCE removal in the columns seeded with Acidimicrobiaceae sp. A6, there was no removal in the unseeded column or the column seeded with G. metallireducens which was being operated under iron reducing conditions. Feammox is an anoxic process that requires acidic conditions. Hence, these results indicate that this process might be harnessed where other bioremediation strategies are difficult, since many require neutral or alkaline conditions, and supplying ammonium to an anoxic aquifer is relatively easy, since there are not many processes that will oxidize ammonium in the absence of dissolved oxygen.",The influence of the open burning of agricultural biomass and forest fires in Thailand on the carbonaceous components in size-fractionated particles.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30685664,"Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)",2019 03 27,"Size-segregated ambient particles down to particles smaller than 0.1 μm (PM0.1) were collected during the year 2014-2015 using cascade air samplers with a PM0.1 stage, at two cities in Thailand, Bangkok and Chiang Mai. Their characteristics and seasonal behavior were evaluated based on the thermal/optical reflectance (IMPROVE_TOR) method. Diagnostic indices for their emission sources and the black carbon (BC) concentration were assessed using an aethalometer and related to the monthly emission inventory (EI) of particle-bound BC and organic carbon (OC) in order to investigate the contribution of agricultural activities and forest fires as well as agro-industries in Thailand. Monthly provincial EIs were evaluated based on the number of agricultural crops produced corresponding to field residue burning and the use of residues as fuel in agro-industries, and also on the number of hot spots from satellite images corresponding to the areas burned by forest fires. The ratio of char-EC/soot-EC describing the relative influence of biomass combustion to diesel emission was found to be in agreement with the EI of BC from biomass burning in the size range <1 μm. This was especially true for PM0.1, which usually tends to be indicative of diesel exhaust particles, and was shown to be very sensitive to the EI of biomass burning. In Chiang Mai, the northern part of Thailand, the forest fires located upwind of the monitoring site were found to be the largest contributor while the carbon behavior at the site in Bangkok was better accounted for by the EI of provinces in central Thailand including Bangkok and its surrounding provinces, where the burning of crop residues and the cultivation of sugarcane for sugar production are significant factors. This suggests that the influence of transportation of polluted air masses is important on a multi-provincial scale (100-200 km) in Thailand.",Longitudinal evidence links joint level mechanics and muscle activation patterns to 3-year medial joint space narrowing.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30685662,"Clinical biomechanics (Bristol, Avon)",2019 02 18,"It is currently not known if there are different mechanical factors involved in accelerated rates of knee osteoarthritis structural progression.

Pelvic floor disorders can have negative influence on women's quality of life, decreasing social, psychological, occupational, physical and sexual well-being. Pelvic organ prolapse results in anatomical changes to the urogenital tract and it is perceived to be one of the main factor influencing sexual function. Because treatment of pelvic organ prolapse and complications related to it may cause discomfort, the most important outcome of the therapy, including anatomical restoration, is relief in symptoms and improvement in quality of life. Psychometrical instruments for measuring health-related quality of life are essential during evaluation of women with pelvic floor disorders. Assessing severity of pelvic organ prolapse, its' impact on quality of life, therapy planning and the inclusion of sexuality questionnaires as an outcome measure in urogynecological patients allows to analyze impact of surgical treatment on women's sexual life. For this purpose, condition - specific instruments were developed and published. The aim of this study is to present particular questionnaires and their proper practical application in clinical practice, especially before surgical treatment and follow-up. Furthermore, those questionnaires are essential in order to describe patients' expectations during tailored clinical management.","Virome profiling of rodents in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, China: Isolation and characterization of a new strain of Wenzhou virus.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30685659,Virology,2019 02 20,"Rodents, as the most diverse and widest distributed mammals, are a natural reservoir of many zoonotic viruses. However, little is known about the viral diversity harbored by rodents in China. Here we performed viral metagenomic analyses of 314 wild rodents covering 7 species, sampled in North-western China. We also conducted a systematic virological characterization of a new Wenzhou virus (WENV) isolate, QARn1, from a brown rat (Rattus norvegicus). Full genomic and phylogenetic analyses showed that QARn1 is a previously unidentified strain of Wenzhou mammarenavirus and forms a new branch within the Asian clade. Experimental infection of Sprague-Dawley rats with QARn1 did not present overt pathology, but specific humoral immune responses developed and mild hemorrhage and immunocyte infiltration of the lungs and thymus were observed. These observations have expanded the geographic distribution of WENV to Central Asia, and further confirm that brown rats are natural hosts of Wenzhou virus."

The studied material included 10 benign and 32 malignant mammary tumours from female dogs treated with mastectomy. Primary mouse monoclonal antibodies directed against p63 protein clone 4A4 and calponin clone CALP were used in single- and doublestain system of immunohistochemical reaction. The investigations have shown that majority of myoepithelial cells in benign tumours and carcinomas in situ exhibited strong positive labelling for both markers. In other malignant tumours strong immunoreactivity was observed in resting myoepithelial cells (MECs) and hypertrophic myoepithelial cells (HMECs), while the immunoreactivity in spindle-stellate myoepithelial cells (SMECs) and rounded myoepithelial cells (RMECs) was moderate. The granular-diffuse nuclear expression of p63 protein was observed only in myoepithelial cells. In terms of calponin, diffuse cytoplasmic expression was noted not only in myoepithelial cell but also in some stromal fibroblasts and vascular smooth muscle cells. The epithelial cells did not exhibit specific expression of the investigated markers. The obtained results indicate that p63 is a sensitive and more specific marker of myoepithelial cells in canine mammary tumours compared with calponin. These findings suggest that the immunohistochemical analysis peformed with the use of p63 can be a valuable complement of routine histological examinations of canine mammary tumours facilitating identification of tumours with myoepithelial component.",Identification of ortho-naphthoquinones as anti-AML agents by highly efficient oxidation of phenols.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30685647,Bioorganic chemistry,2019 04 14,"A straightforward method for synthesizing ortho-naphthoquinones was identified using an easily available cobalt-Schiff base complex.

The cobalt-Schiff base complex was found to be an efficient catalyst in the transformation of phenols to ortho-quinones, and the compound 4h represents a potential scaffold to optimize the production of a treatment for AML.","New thiazol-hydrazono-coumarin hybrids targeting human cervical cancer cells: Synthesis, CDK2 inhibition, QSAR and molecular docking studies.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30685646,Bioorganic chemistry,2019 04 14,"Motivated by the potential anticancer activity of both coumarin and 2-aminothiazole nuclei, a new set of thiazol-2-yl hydrazono-chromen-2-one analogs were efficiently synthesized aiming to obtain novel hybrids with potential cytotoxic activity. MTT assay investigated the significant potency of all the target compounds against the human cervical cancer cell lines (HeLa cells). Cell cycle analysis showed that the representative compound 8a led to cell cycle cessation at G0/G1 phase indicating that CDK2/E1complex could be the plausible biological target for these newly synthesized compounds. Thus, the most active compounds (7c and 8a-c) were tested for their CDK2 inhibitory activity. The biological results revealed their significant CDK2 inhibitory activity with IC50 range of 0.022-1.629 nM. Moreover, RT-PCR gene expression assay showed that compound 8a increased the levels of the nuclear CDK2 regulators P21 and P27 by 2.30 and 5.7 folds, respectively. ELISA tequnique showed also that compound 8a led to remarkable activation of caspases-9 and -3 inducing cell apoptosis. QSAR study showed that the charge distribution and molecular hydrophobicity are the structural features affecting cytotoxic activity in this series. Molecular docking study for the most potent cytotoxic compounds (7c and 8a-c) rationalized their superior CDK2 inhibitory activity through their hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions with the key amino acids in the CDK2 binding site. Pharmacokinetic properties prediction of the most potent compounds showed that the newly synthesized compounds are not only with promising antitumor activity but also possess promising pharmacokinetic properties.","Trifluoromethylated carboline compounds targeting DNA: Synthesis, binding and anti-proliferative effects on human cancer cell lines.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30685645,Bioorganic chemistry,2019 04 14,"Three sets of carboline derived compounds were prepared by Pictet-Spengler cyclization. These tetrahydro β- and γ-carbolines have CF3 group with an additional amino alkyl chains (α- or δ-position) and guanidine alkyl chains (α-position), of varying length. Structure-activity relationship of these molecules with calf thymus DNA was emphasized by fluorescence, ITC, FTIR and viscosity. Binding with DNA resulted in dramatic enhancement and quenching in the fluorescence emission. Gamma-carboline analogs showed maximum DNA binding followed by beta-carboline compounds with amino alkyl chain and least with guanidine alkyl chain compounds. It decreased with increasing chain length. The bindings were entropically driven being more with guanidine alkyl chain analogs. Site preference and mode of binding with partial intercalation and external binding was supported by FTIR and viscosity. Cytotoxic potencies of the compounds were tested on seven different cancer cell lines. The smallest alkyl chain analog attached to gamma position, Comp3, showed maximum cytotoxicity with GI50 6.2 µM, against HCT-116 causing apoptosis, followed by the guanidine alkyl chain compounds, but amino alkyl chain compounds to beta position showed poor cytotoxicity.

The repeated applications of the chelates were found to be more effective than the one time application at the equal dose as the U concentration of soil solution increased significantly from the 8th to 14th day. The repeated applications of 10 mmol kg-1 CA promoted the solubilization of U in the U-contaminated soil by significantly decreasing the pH of soil solution, achieved the maximum U concentration of soil solution (1463.6 µg L-1), bioconcentration factors (BCFs, 11.4), bioaccumulation factors (BAFs, 21.4) and transfer factors (TFs, 1.9), which were 215.2, 5.7, 30.6 and 16.3 times as compared with the control group, respectively. The three applied chelates significantly affected the activities of the antioxidant enzymes in the leaves. Repeated applications of CA further enhanced the activities of the antioxidant enzymes in the leaves of M. cordata as compared with the control, EDDS and OA, mitigated the oxidative stress induced by uranium and chelates, and maximized the enhancement on the uranium uptake, which will be beneficial for the enhancement on the phytoremediation of uranium contaminated soil by U hyperaccumulating plants. These results indicated that the phytoavailability of uranium in soil solution as well as the accumulation of U by M. cordata were both significantly increased after repeated applications of CA, and that the repeated applications of 10 mmol kg-1 CA increased the activities of the antioxidant enzymes and promoted U accumulation by M. cordata.

The binding isotherm deduced from ITC was found to be spontaneous and exothermic exerting a promising ΔG value of -6.2 kcal mol-1. The thermal kinetic parameters implied that the forces primarily involved in the CMT-ct-DNA complexation are hydrogen bonding and van der Waals interactions. Moreover, the structural alterations of DNA duplex reflected in the CD and FTIR spectra could undeniably confirm the groove binding manner of CMT. The in silico extra precision docking study explored more accurate molecular illustrations of sequence specific minor groove binding mechanism evolved between CMT and DNA corroborating well with the experimental results. These innovative findings may shorten the path towards the development of novel and more effective CMT drug derivatives.",Therapeutic interventions with child survivors of sibling sexual abuse: The professionals' perspective.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30685626,Child abuse & neglect,2019 02 10,"Sibling sexual abuse (SSA) is a continuum of childhood sexual behaviors that do not fit age-appropriate curiosity.

Thermal desorption is one of the methods commonly used to remediate contaminated soil. This method has received increasing attention for remediating contaminated sites due to its advantages, such as suitability to different types of contaminants, short treatment period, high efficiency, high safety, and capability to recycle soil and contaminants. This paper provides a comprehensive review of studies on thermal desorption. Introduction of the mechanism, classification, and cost of thermal desorption is presented. Factors affecting the performance of thermal desorption (heating temperature, heating time, heating rate, carrier gas, soil particle size, moisture content, initial concentration of contaminants, and additives) are reviewed. Thermal desorption produces off-gases, which are mostly organic compounds and may result in secondary pollution. Thus far, treatment methods for off-gas have not been systematically investigated. This paper also summarizes current methods for treatment of off-gas in the soil field and of volatile organic compounds in atmospheric and water pollution fields. Several feasible off-gas treatment methods are also comparatively analyzed, and the corresponding principles, advantages, disadvantages, and application ranges are discussed.",Determining binding of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons to CTABr micelles using semi-equilibrium dialysis techniques.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30685622,Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,2019 04 29,"Micellar enhanced ultrafiltration (MEUF) has been shown to be an effective removal technique for a variety of trace contaminants in wastewater, especially for water soluble low molecular weight organic contaminants. In MEUF, contaminants first partition into surfactant micelles prior to removal by ultrafiltration, where the contaminants are below the molecular weight cut-off of the ultrafiltration membrane but the micelles are above the cut-off. Binding constants of selected Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) such as naphthalene, phenanthrene, pyrene and fluorene have been determined in order to examine the removal efficiency of MEUF for PAHs with Cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTABr) using a semi equilibrium dialysis method. PAHs show strong binding with CTABr because of hydrophobic interactions. Our results enabled us to develop a relationship between binding constant (log KB) and log KOW for neutral compounds, which will be useful for predicting MEUF performance for PAHs removal from waste water. The range of our reported binding constant values are from 2.61 to 5.07.",Complement regulatory protein CD59a plays a protective role in immune liver injury of trichloroethylene-sensitized BALB/c mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30685621,Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,2019 04 29,"Trichloroethylene (TCE) is a major occupational and environmental chemical compound which causes occupational dermatitis medicamentosa-like of TCE with severe liver damage. Our previous studies showed that complement activation was a newly recognized mechanism for TCE-induced liver damage. The objective of this study was to explore the role of the key complement regulatory protein, CD59a, in TCE-induced immune liver injury. We firstly evaluated the changes of CD59a expression in liver tissue and then investigated if the changes were associated with membrane attack complex (MAC) formation, nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) activation and liver damage in BALB/c mice model of TCE-induced skin sensitization in the absence or presence of soluble recombinant rat CD59-Cys. The results showed that low expression of CD59a accompanied by MAC deposition in the liver of TCE-sensitized BALB/c mice, which was consistent in time. In addition, activation of NF-κB pathway, upregulation of inflammatory cytokine and liver damage also occured. Additional experiment showed that recombinant rat sCD59-Cys alleviated inflammation and liver damage in TCE-sensitized BALB/c mice. Moreover, recombinant rat sCD59-Cys reduced MAC formation and inhibited NF-κB activation measured by P-IκBα and nuclear NF-κB p65 in the liver of TCE-sensitized BALB/c mice. In conclusion, recombinant rat sCD59-Cys plays a protective role in immune liver injury of TCE-sensitized BALB/c mice.",High-performance porous biochar from the pyrolysis of natural and renewable seaweed (Gelidiella acerosa) and its application for the adsorption of methylene blue.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30685620,Bioresource technology,2019 02 10,"A high-performance porous biochar adsorbent prepared by facile thermal pyrolysis of seaweed (Gelidiella acerosa) is reported. The textural characteristics of the prepared seaweed biochar (SWBC) and the performance in the adsorption of methylene blue (MB) dye were evaluated. The batch experiment for the adsorption of MB was conducted under different parameters, such as temperature, pH, and initial concentration of MB in the range of 25-400 mg/L. The developed SWBC exhibited a relatively high surface area, average pore size, and pore volume of 926.39 m2/g, 2.45 nm, and 0.57 cm3/g, respectively. The high surface area and pristine mineral constituents of the biochar promoted a high adsorption capacity of 512.67 mg/g of MB at 30 °C. The adsorption isotherm and kinetics data best fitted the Langmuir and pseudo-second-order equations. The results indicate that SWBC is efficient for MB adsorption and could be a potential adsorbent for wastewater treatment.","Catalytic, thermodynamic and structural properties of an immobilized and highly thermostable alkaline protease from a haloalkaliphilic actinobacteria, Nocardiopsis alba TATA-5.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30685619,Bioresource technology,2019 02 10,"A highly thermostable protease from a haloalkaliphilic actinobacteria was immobilized employing 5 different approaches on 24 carriers. On immobilization, the activation energy and deactivation rate constant decreased, which makes the immobilized protease favourable for applications. Similarly, pH and temperature stability was enhanced, while the Vmax and Km changed upon immobilization. The immobilized enzyme had greater stability in various metal ions and detergents. The structural topography of the immobilized enzyme elucidated by the FTIR suggested the function of aliphatic amines, alkenes and esters since amide I and II bands were affected. Noticeable decrease in the Amide A band suggests interaction between the immobilization carriers and -NH groups of the protease molecule. The suitability of the immobilized protease was established by designing a continuous flow enzyme bioreactor, displaying the enzyme half-life of 916.15 min at 60 °C. The enzyme reactor was highly efficient in the treatment of the municipal and dairy wastewater.","Simultaneous saccharification and fermentation of oil palm front for the production of 2,3-butanediol.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30685618,Bioresource technology,2019 02 10,"The present study aims to develop a process for the production of 2,3-butanediol by Simultaneous Saccharification and Fermentation (SSF) of Oil Palm Front (OPF) biomass.

However, the CRP level can lead to misdiagnosis since it is up-regulated not only during bacterial infection. In this prospective study, we evaluated the serum cytokine profile before (pre-OP) and after orthopaedic surgery (post-OP) as well as after confirmation of a developed infection (COI) to identify candidate biomarkers for diagnosis of IAI. Sera from 10 controls 7 to 1 days pre-OP and 0 to 22 days post-OP as well as from 5 patients who developed IAI 5 to 1 days pre-OP, 0 to 197 days post-OP and after COI were analyzed for 27 different cytokines using a multiplex cytokine assay. In addition to CRP, 14 cytokines IL-1ra, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12(p70), IL-13, IL-17, eotaxin, G-CSF, IFN-γ, IP-10, MCP-1, and MIP-1β were significantly altered (P ≤ 0.05) during the study although some differences were low-fold elevations compared to the pre-OP levels. IL-6 as well as IL-12(p70) were consistently elevated in infected patients. Surgery influenced cytokine production with some overlap of cytokines in both groups, implying that the use of cytokines is maximized when the cytokines are not or no longer affected by surgical trauma. To lend more robustness to the selection of candidate cytokines, in addition to the statistical differences, we applied a threshold cut-off of approximately 2-fold elevations when comparisons were made. This resulted in the selection of 8 cytokines, namely IL-6, IL-1ra, IL-8, IL-12(p70), eotaxin, IP-10, MCP-1, and MIP-1β, which may be used in a multiplex assay for detection of IAI after surgery. Furthermore, IL-1ra and IL-8 may be used as prognostic cytokines prior to surgery. The present results imply that the use of cytokines may be a suitable alternative to CRP for IAI diagnosis.",Identification of an IKBKE inhibitor with antitumor activity in cancer cells overexpressing IKBKE.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30685606,Cytokine,2019 02 13,"The serine/threonine kinase IKBKE is frequently overexpressed or activated in a variety of human cancers.

Here, we have studied the role of SQSTM1/p62 in the production of IL-6, IL-8, and MCP-1 in the presence or absence of IL-1β. SQSTM1/p62 was either overexpressed or silenced in ARPE-19 cells, which were then exposed to IL-1β. Alternatively, bafilomycin A was used to demonstrate the functional decline of autophagy with increased SQSTM1/p62 levels. The protein concentration of SQSTM1/p62 was measured using the western blot technique, and interleukin levels were determined by ELISA. In IL-1β-loaded RPE cells, SQSTM1/p62 depletion and overexpression increased the production of MCP-1 and IL-8, respectively. Neither knock-down nor overexpression of SQSTM1/p62 induced the release of IL-6. Our data suggest that SQSTM1/p62 is a significant factor in inflammatory responses, especially following the inflammasome activation.",Anti-inflammatory property of quercetin through downregulation of ICAM-1 and MMP-9 in TNF-α-activated retinal pigment epithelial cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30685603,Cytokine,2019 02 13,"Quercetin is a flavonoid polyphenolic compound present in fruits and vegetables that has proven anti-inflammatory activity. The goal of the present investigation was to investigate the effects of quercetin on tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)-induced inflammatory responses via the expression of ICAM-1 and MMP-9 in human retinal pigment epithelial cells (ARPE-19 cells). Real-time PCR, gelatin zymography, and Western blot analysis showed that TNF-α induced the expression of ICAM-1 and MMP-9 protein and mRNA in a time-dependent manner. These effects were attenuated by pretreatment of ARPE-19 cells with quercetin. Quercetin inhibited the TNF-α-induced phosphorylation of PKCδ, JNK1/2, ERK1/2. Quercetin, rottlerin, SP600125 and U0126 attenuated TNF-α-stimulated c-Jun phosphorylation and AP-1-Luc activity. Pretreatment with quercetin, rottlerin, SP600125, or Bay 11-7082 attenuated TNF-α-induced NF-κB (p65) phosphorylation, translocation and RelA/p65-Luc activity. TNF-α significantly increased MMP-9 promoter activity and THP-1 cell adherence, and these effects were attenuated by pretreatment with quercetin, rottlerin, SP600125, U0126, tanshinone IIA or Bay 11-7082. These results suggest that quercetin attenuates TNF-α-induced ICAM-1 and MMP-9 expression in ARPE-19 cells via the MEK1/2-ERK1/2 and PKCδ-JNK1/2-c-Jun or NF-κB pathways.",G-CSF administration favours SDF-1 release and activation of neutrophils and monocytes in recipients of autologous peripheral blood progenitor cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30685602,Cytokine,2019 02 13,"G-CSF is a growth factor widely used to mobilise CD34+ progenitor cells for clinical applications. The present study aimed to assess expression of G-CSF receptor (CSF3R) on neutrophils and monocytes, as well as SDF-1 and G-CSF serum levels in relation to efficacy of G-CSF-induced mobilisation for autologous transplantation. For this purpose, 105 patients with haematological disorders and 46 healthy controls were investigated. Before mobilisation patients were characterised with significantly higher percentage of CSF3R expressing neutrophils (p < 0.001) and monocytes (p = 0.002), than controls. G-CSF administration resulted in a decrease of CSF3R+ neutrophils (p < 0.001) and monocytes (p < 0.001), while presence of G-CSF receptor on neutrophils tended to negatively affect mobilisation yield (p = 0.075). G-CSF concentration increased during mobilisation (p < 0.001). On the 5th day of mobilisation a positive correlation was observed between G-CSF and SDF-1 serum levels (p < 0.001) and the number of CD34+ cells released from bone marrow seemed to be related to both G-CSF (p = 0.036) and SDF-1 levels (p = 0.084). As compared to Hodgkin's lymphoma patients, those with multiple myeloma had lower basal percentage of CSF3R+ neutrophils (p = 0.014) while Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma cases exhibited higher G-CSF (p = 0.026) and SDF-1 (p = 0.006) concentration on mobilisation day 5. Hodgkin's lymphoma patients were also characterised with worse mobilisation efficacy than multiple myeloma (p = 0.022) and Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (p = 0.013) patients. These results suggest that both SDF-1 and G-CSF play a role in HSC release into peripheral blood and show that G-CSF administration affects expression of CSF3R on monocytes and neutrophils, implying potential role of these cell subpopulations in mobilisation process.",Experiences of an outpatient infusion center with intravenous magnesium therapy for status migrainosus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30685601,Clinical neurology and neurosurgery,2019 02 19,"Exploratory study to investigate the effectiveness of intravenous magnesium as an abortive for status migrainosus in an outpatient infusion center, and characterize the patients who benefit from the therapy.",Cross-cultural validation of the Urdu translation of the Patient Health Questionnaire for Adolescents among children and adolescents at a Pakistani school.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30685600,Public health,2019 05 02,"There is a high prevalence of depressive disorders among children and adolescents globally, accounting for 45% of disability-adjusted life years among 10- to 24-year-olds.

The cytotoxicity effect of nGO was investigated by various in vitro assays. The surface activated nGO was exhibited its maximum absorption peak at 233 nm. The XRD analysis shows that the intensity of graphite was decreased and new peak arises around 2Ѳ=11.4o with an interlayer distance of 0.728 to 0.828 nm. In addition, microscopic studies demonstrated that the synthesized nGO was found as a transparent layer with the crispy structure as well as few layers appear as nanoflakes.

B, Biology",2019 03 08,"Arboviral diseases and microbial pathogens resistant to commercially available drugs are on the rise. Herein, a facile microbial-based approach was developed to synthesize selenium nanowires (Se NWs) using microbial exopolymer (MEP) extracted from the Bacillus licheniformis (probiotic bacteria). MEP-Se NWs were characterized using UV-Visible, XRD, FTIR, HR-TEM, FE-SEM and EDX. An UV-Visible peak was detected at 330 nm while XRD spectrum data pointed out the crystalline nature of MEP-Se NWs. FTIR spectrum revealed functional groups with strong absorption peaks in the range 3898.52-477.97 cm-1. FE-SEM and HR-TEM revealed that the obtained structures were nanowires of 10-30 nm diameter. Se presence was confirmed by EDX analysis. MEP-Se NWs at 100 μg/ml highly suppressed the growth of both Gram (-) and Gram (+) bacteria. Further, microscopic analysis evidenced that 75 μg/ml MEP-Se NWs suppressed biofilm formation. Hemolytic assays showed that MEP-Se NWs were moderately cytotoxic. In addition, LC50 values lower than 10 μg/ml were estimated testing MEP-Se NWs on both Aedes aegypti and Culex quinquefasciatus 3rd instar larvae. Morphological and histological techniques were used to elucidate on the damages triggered in mosquito tissues, with special reference to midgut, post-exposure to MEP-Se NWs. Therefore, based on our findings, MEP-Se NWs can be considered for entomological and biomedical applications, with special reference to the management of biofilm forming microbial pathogens and arbovirus mosquito vectors.",Adsorption and reductive degradation of Cr(VI) and TCE by a simply synthesized zero valent iron magnetic biochar.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30685583,Journal of environmental management,2019 02 09,"To address inorganic and organic contaminants in the environment, economic new adsorbents are required. Here we test magnetic biochar for efficient capture of the typical pollutants Cr(VI) and trichloroethylene (TCE) from solution. We used a simple synthesis using 2M FeCl3 solution and peanut hull biomass to prepare magnetic ZVI biochar at alternate pyrolysis temperatures between 650 and 800 °C. The physicochemical character of the biochars were assessed using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method for surface area. The magnetic ZVI biochars were highly effective in the removal of Cr(VI) and TCE. The most effective magnetic biochar produced at 800 °C was further examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), revealing a high and even loading of ZVI. After sorption the same magnetic biochar was examined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to ascertain the underlying mechanisms. The dependence of Cr(VI) capture on solution pH was also examined. Our interpretation suggests that when pH < pHzpc (2.5) electrostatic attraction and redox reactions dominated the adsorption of Cr(VI). When pH > pHzpc the removal process was controlled mainly by redox reaction and substitution of chromate anions for hydroxyl (OH) groups. Capture of TCE in contrast involved hydrophobic partitioning, pore-filling and reductive degradation. Overall our results suggest that simple synthesis of magnetic ZVI biochar could offer an economic and effective option to address water contamination issues.",Assessment of factors driving high fire severity potential and classification in a Mediterranean pine ecosystem.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30685582,Journal of environmental management,2019 02 09,"Fire severity is an increasingly critical issue for forest managers for estimating fire impacts. Estimating high fire severity potential and accurate classification between fire severity levels are essential for integrated fire management planning in fire prone Mediterranean pine ecosystems. This study attempts to determine the role of topography, pre-fire forest stand structure, fuel complex characteristics and fire behavior parameters on high fire severity potential and classification based on a large fire event occurred in Thasos, Greece. Within this framework, the Random Forest (RF) classification algorithm was used to model the relationship between a large set of predictors and fire severity as expressed by the differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR) spectral index, inferred from differenced pre- and post-fire Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) at 30-m resolution. Results from the RF classifier algorithm showed that high fire severity potential and classification between fire severity levels mainly depended on topography variables and fuel complex characteristics. Assessing of factors which drive a fire to turn into high severe fire and classification into fire severity levels will substantially help land and forest managers to increase fire prevention and develop of concrete actions for successful post fire management at landscape level.",Acute effects of milk polar lipids on intestinal tight junction expression: towards an impact of sphingomyelin through the regulation of IL-8 secretion?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30685581,The Journal of nutritional biochemistry,2019 03 15,"Milk polar lipids (MPL) are specifically rich in milk sphingomyelin (MSM) which represents 24% of MPL. Beneficial effects of MPL or MSM have been reported on lipid metabolism, but information on gut physiology is scarce. Here we assessed whether MPL and MSM can impact tight junction expression. Human epithelial intestinal Caco-2/TC7 cells were incubated with mixed lipid micelles devoid of MSM (Control) or with 0.2 or 0.4 mM of MSM via pure MSM or via total MPL. C57Bl/6 mice received 5 or 10 mg of MSM via MSM or via MPL (oral gavage); small intestinal segments were collected after 4 h. Impacts on tight junction and cytokine expressions were assessed by qPCR; IL-8 and IL-8 murine homologs (Cxcl1, Cxcl2) were analyzed. In vitro, MSM increased tight junction expression (Occludin, ZO-1) vs Control, unlike MPL. However, no differences were observed in permeability assays (FITC-dextran, Lucifer yellow). MSM increased the secretion and gene expression of IL-8 but not of other inflammatory cytokines. Moreover, cell incubation with IL-8 induced an overexpression of tight junction proteins. In mice, mRNA level of Cxcl1 and Cxcl2 in the ileum were increased after gavage with MSM vs NaCl but not with MPL. Altogether, these results suggest a specific action of MSM on intestinal tight junction expression, possibly mediated by IL-8. Our study provides clues to shed light on the beneficial effects of MPL on intestinal functions and supports the need for further mechanistic exploration of the direct vs indirect effects of MSM and IL-8 on the gut barrier.",Tryptophan restriction partially recapitulates the age-dependent effects of total amino acid restriction on energy balance in diet-induced obese rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30685580,The Journal of nutritional biochemistry,2019 03 15,"Moderate dietary protein restriction promotes hyperphagia and thermogenesis; however, little is known of whether these responses are due to restriction of the essential amino acids tryptophan and histidine. Here, we determined whether restriction of tryptophan and histidine alone recapitulate the effects of total amino acid restriction on energy balance, and whether the metabolic responses are age-dependent. We fed young (12 weeks old) and older (29 weeks old) diet-induced obese rats with one of four high-fat diets: control (CON, 100% amino acid requirement), total amino acid restriction (TAA, 67% amino acid restriction), tryptophan restriction (TRP, 67% tryptophan restriction) or histidine restriction (HIS, 67% histidine restriction) for 21 days. Energy balance, hormones, and key markers of hepatic nutrient sensing and brown adipose thermogenesis were measured. We found that TAA increased food intake in both young and older rats, with TRP, but not HIS, transiently simulating the hyperphagia. TAA promoted sympathetically mediated increase in energy expenditure in young rats partly through increased β2-adrenergic and FGF21 signaling in brown fat; TRP partially emulated these responses. TRP and HIS transiently increased fat mass in young rats, and TAA promoted adiposity in older rats. TAA, TRP and HIS increased postprandial FGF21 concentrations in older rats. TAA induced age-dependent differential changes in markers of hepatic amino acid sensing; TRP and HIS partially mimicked these responses. Collectively, restriction of tryptophan, but not histidine, partially recapitulated the age-dependent metabolic effects of total amino acid restriction, in concert with distinct changes in hepatic amino acid sensing and signaling mechanisms.",Usefulness of qSOFA and SIRS scores for detection of incipient sepsis in general ward patients: A prospective cohort study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30685579,Journal of critical care,2019 05 25,To prospectively assess the diagnostic value of quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) and systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) scores for sepsis in ward patients with infections.,The co-occurrence of pitch and rhythm disorders in congenital amusia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30685578,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,2019 04 02,"The most studied form of congenital amusia is characterized by a difficulty with detecting pitch anomalies in melodies, also referred to as pitch deafness. Here, we tested for the presence of associated deficits in rhythm processing, beat in particular, in pitch deafness. In Experiment 1, participants performed beat perception and production tasks with musical excerpts of various genres. The results show a beat finding disorder in six of the ten assessed pitch-deaf participants. In order to remove a putative interference of pitch variations with beat extraction, the same participants were tested with percussive rhythms in Experiment 2 and showed a similar impairment. Furthermore, musical pitch and beat processing abilities were correlated. These new results highlight the tight connection between melody and rhythm in music processing that can nevertheless dissociate in some individuals.",Orienting and memory to unexpected and/or unfamiliar visual events in children and adults.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30685577,Developmental cognitive neuroscience,2019 05 21,"For children, new experiences occur very often, and learning to differentiate between old and new events is a fundamental process necessary for appropriate reactions to stimuli. Thus the present study is concerned with maturation of brain responses to repeated novel events. We examined the effect of repetition of familiar (meaningful) and unfamiliar (meaningless) symbols on the event-related-potentials (ERPs) recorded during novelty oddball and recognition memory tasks from children, adolescents and young adults. During the novelty oddball task, repetition of the familiar symbols elicited a reduction in the novelty P3 in the ERPs of all age groups, while repetition of the unfamiliar symbols elicited a reduction in novelty P3 amplitude only in children. As expected, recognition memory performance improved with age and was better for familiar than unfamiliar symbols. For all age groups, ERPs to correctly recognized familiar old symbols elicited a larger positivity than ERPs to correctly identified new symbols, indicating a reliable memory effect. However, ERPs to unfamiliar old and new symbols did not differ in adults and adolescents but did differ in children. The data suggest that children process familiar visual symbols in a similar fashion to that of adults, and that children process unfamiliar symbols differently from adults.","Separating spatial patterns in pollution attributable to woodsmoke and other sources, during daytime and nighttime hours, in Christchurch, New Zealand.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30685575,Environmental research,2019 02 20,"During winter nights, woodsmoke may be a predominant source of air pollution, even in cities with many sources. Since two major earthquakes resulted in major structural damage in 2010 and 2011, reliance on woodburning for home heating has increased substantially in Christchurch, New Zealand (NZ), along with intensive construction/demolition activities. Further, because NZ is a relatively isolated western country, it offers the unique opportunity to disentangle multiple source impacts in the absence of long-range transport pollution. Finally, although many spatial saturation studies have been published, and levoglucosan is an established tracer for woodburning emissions, few studies have monitored multiple sites simultaneously for this or other organic constituents, with the ability to distinguish spatial patterns for daytime vs. nighttime hours, in complex urban settings. We captured seven-day integrated samples of PM2.5, and elemental and organic tracers of woodsmoke and diesel emissions, during ""daytime"" (7 a.m. - 5:30 p.m.) and ""nighttime"" (7 p.m. - 5:30 a.m.) hours, at nine sites across commercial and residential areas, over three weeks in early winter (May 2014). At a subset of six sites, we also sampled during hypothesized ""peak"" woodburning hours (7 p.m. - 12 a.m.), to differentiate emissions during ""active"" residential woodburning, vs. overnight smouldering. Concentrations of PM2.5 were, on average, were twice as high during nighttime than daytime [µ = 18.4 (SD = 6.13) vs. 9.21 (SD = 6.13) µg/m3], with much greater differences in woodsmoke tracers (i.e., levoglucosan [µ = 1.83 (SD = 0.82) vs. 0.34 (SD = 0.17) µg/m3], potassium) and indicators of treated- or painted-wood burning (e.g., arsenic, lead). Only nitrogen dioxide, calcium, iron, and manganese (tracers of vehicular emissions) were higher during daytime. Levoglucosan and most PAHs were higher during ""active"" woodburning, vs. overnight smouldering. Our time-stratified spatial saturation detected strong spatial variability throughout the study area, which distinctly differed during daytime vs. night time hours, and quantified the substantial contribution of woodsmoke to overnight spatial variation in PM2.5 across Christchurch. Daytime vs. nighttime differences were greater than those observed across sites. Traffic, especially diesel, contributed substantially to daytime NO2 and spatial gradients in non-woodsmoke constituents."

In other fields it has been surpassed by modern regularization methods. We analyze such alternative regularization methods based on the Tikhonov, total variation (TV) and Huber penalties with and without the use of Bregman iterations. For this, we provide a general mathematical framework and its open-source software implementation. We extend an earlier approach by Edwards and Stoll for the selection of an optimal regularization parameter to all of these penalties and use their big test data set of noisy DEER traces with known ground truth for assessment. The results indicate that regularization methods based on Bregman iterations provide an improvement upon Tikhonov regularization in recognizing features and recovering distribution width at moderate signal-to-noise ratio, provided that noise variance is known.

We study the influence of molecular orientation duration and degree on the ionization probability, angle-resolved photoelectron spectrum and photoelectron angular distribution (PAD). It is shown that we could obtain more stable ionization signal and PAD when the molecules are ionized in molecular orientation duration. We could increase the ionization probability and obtain more concentrated ionization signal and photoelectron distribution by increasing the orientation degree in the ground state.

Part A, Molecular and biomolecular spectroscopy",2019 03 21,"The potential of fluorescence spectroscopy is exploited for the characterization and comparison of different turmeric varieties based on curcuminoids content in turmeric powders. Fluorescence spectra from turmeric powders has been acquired by using excitation wavelengths from 300 to 470 nm with step of 10 nm to investigate the effect of excitation wavelengths on the emission of valuable ingredients for their characterization. Emission spectra revealed that fresh wet turmeric rhizomes show emission bands at 571 nm which is due to curcumin. It is found that main ingredient of turmeric powder is curcumin and best excitation wavelength is 467 nm for its maximum emission intensity. High Pressure Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) was used as alternate standard technique for determination of curcuminoid content in the reference samples. The curcumin content in the commercially available local turmeric brands were also evaluated, one brand showed significant covariance from standard fluorescent spectra of turmeric meaning this particular brand contained minimum curcumin content or have been severely adultered. In the next step the powders were heated at different temperatures from 60 °C to 150 °C (Normal cooking & frying temperatures) to observe the difference in emission spectra particularly keeping in view the molecular composition and curcuminoid content in turmeric. The results indicate that curcumin content gradually decreases above 90 °C. Principal component analysis (PCA) has been employed on all the data to statistically differentiate small molecular changes and adulteration by covariance calculations.",Specific and universal interactions in Benzo-[f]-Quinolinium Acetyl-Benzoyl Methylid (BQABM) solutions; excited state dipole moment of BQABM.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30685557,"Spectrochimica acta.

The nature and contribution of each type of intermolecular interaction to the spectral shifts in different solvents were estimated based on solvatochromic analyze of BQABM visible absorption band. The correlation coefficients for the dependence of the wavenumber in the maximum of BQABM visible band vs. the solvent parameters were computed by Linear Energy Relationships Simulation (LERS). The optimized geometry of BQABM and some physical and chemical parameters for isolated molecule in its ground electronic state were obtained with Spartan'14 programs. The results obtained in quantum mechanical analysis and also LERS correlation coefficients were used to determine the excited state dipole moment of BQABM by a Variational method in McRae and Kawschi hypothesis that the molecular polarizability does not change in the visible absorption process. An increase in the BQABM electric dipole moment by excitation resulted in our study.,"Electronic structure and optical properties of Ln(III) nitrate adducts with 1,10-phenanthroline.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30685556,"Spectrochimica acta.

The geometric structure for DFT modeling is build using X-ray diffraction data. To analyze the composition and differences of the electronic structure in the series under study, XPS spectra were obtained for which interpretation was performed using calculated data. It has been shown that the molecule of Phen, when attached to the complexes of nitrates, is polarized, leads to an increase in absorption in the visible region and reduces the energy gap between HOMO and LUMO. Experimental absorption spectra were obtained, described and interpreted using TDDFT simulation. The transitions in adducts from π to π * MO in Phen ligands determine the main absorption band. The reasons for the absence of luminescence in adducts with ions Ce(III), Nd(III), and Er(III) are revealed by the example of the correlation diagram of singlet and triplet levels. A possible origin of coloring of adducts is determined using TDDFT.",Two novel rhodamine-based fluorescent probes for the rapid and sensitive detection of Fe3+: Experimental and DFT calculations.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30685555,"Spectrochimica acta.

Upon the addition of Fe3+, the fluorescence intensity of RBA2 and RBA3 enhanced 108-fold and 222-fold, respectively. RBA2 and RBA3 exhibited a low detection limit which could achieve 12.8 nM and 11.0 nM.

VEL has two UV maxima at 302.5 and 337.0 nm that allow its direct determination by zero-order spectrophotometric method (D°) without any interference from SOF in a linear range of 2.0-30.0 μg/mL. On the other hand, determination of SOF in presence of VEL was carried out by four smart spectrophotometric methods, developed for resolving the overlaid spectra of these binary mixture. These methods are dual wavelength (DW), ratio subtraction (RS), ratio difference (RD) and first derivative of ratio spectra method (1DD). Linearity was checked and found to be in the range of 5.0-90.0 μg/mL for SOF by all of the aforementioned spectrophotometric methods. The developed methods were optimized and validated in accordance to the ICH guidelines. They were successfully utilized for estimating both SOF and VEL in their pure forms, laboratory prepared mixtures and in their pharmaceutical formulations with good recoveries.

Ribbon-like nanostructures were obtained when the concentration of NaOH was lower and further increase of NaOH transformed it into long nanowires. These nanowires possess high aspect ratio, with length and diameter ~6.5 μm and 17 nm respectively. The surface enhanced Raman scattering activity of these nanowires was tested with three different probe molecules viz., crystal violet, malachite green and nile blue chloride using visible (514.4 nm) and near-infrared (784.8 nm) excitation lines. The minimum detection limits for crystal violet and nile blue chloride molecules were found to be down to 10-7 M with good linear responses, as evidenced by values of correlation coefficients, indicating their potential for a variety of applications such as sensing. Principal component analysis was performed with the surface enhanced Raman spectra in order to discriminate the dye molecules and their mixture, simultaneously. The first two principal components, which provided 69.80 and 27.93% of the total data variance, could be conveniently represented as a two dimensional PCA score plot. The score plot showed clear clustering of probe molecules and their mixture. The relative contribution of wavenumbers to each of the two principal components was identified by plotting the PCA loading matrix. These results further promote possibilities of quantification of multiplexed SERS detection and analysis.","Reverse effect of Sm3+ on Ce3+ in Ca2BO3Cl:Ce3+/Tb3+/Sm3+ phosphor: Luminescence, energy transfer and occupation site.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30685552,"Spectrochimica acta.

There is an interesting phenomenon that the right side of the Ce3+ emission spectra in Ca2BO3Cl:Ce3+, Sm3+ compresses gradually with increasing the Sm3+ concentration. By means of refinement, it can be found that Sm3+ ions are mainly occupied in the Ca2 sites, because the cell of the Ca2 lattice is easily occupied. Then, the emission peak2 of Ce3+ in Ca2 sites occurs to blue shift. While the emission peak1 of Ce3+ in Ca1 sites is basically stability. However, the emission of Ce3+ in Ca2BO3Cl:Ce3+, Tb3+, Sm3+ have different changes with increasing the Sm3+ concentration that the emission peaks of Ce3+ shift to long wave at first then to short wave and the FWHM remains stability. This can be attributed to the existence of Tb3+. For the energy transfer mechanism, according to Dexter's energy transfer theory and Reisfeld's approximation, the energy transfer process of Ce3+/Sm3+ and Tb3+/Sm3+ should be the dipole-dipole interaction.

The results showed that aminoguanidines (6) exhibited much better antibacterial activity than semicarbazides (7) and thiosemicarbazides (8). Most compounds in series 6 showed potent inhibitory activity against the tested bacterial strains, including multidrug-resistant strains, with MIC values in the range of 1.08-23.46 μM.

In this study, we investigated the relationships among systemic inflammation, functional network connectivity (FNC) of the whole brain, and social-network size using complete social-network data of older adults residing in a Korean village. Sixty-one participants were recruited from the Korean Social Life, Health, and Aging Project (KSHAP). Participants underwent a resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging scan. High sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) levels were measured as an inflammation marker. In-degree and out-degree network sizes were calculated based on the total number of intimate social relationships per participant. We demonstrated that hs-CRP levels were associated with decreased frontotemporal FNC. Stronger frontotemporal FNC was significantly correlated with a larger out-degree network size, suggesting that impaired frontotemporal communication in older adults decreases perceived social connectedness with other people. An exploratory mediation analysis supported the observation that increased systemic inflammation contributes to reduced out-degree social-network size among older adults by changing frontotemporal FNC.

However, whether T cells infiltrate into the spinal cord and contribute to the development of bone cancer pain (BCP) remains unknown. Here, we used a mouse model of BCP to show that numbers of T cells infiltrated into the spinal cord after sarcoma cell implantation with increased BCP, and most infiltrating T cells in the spinal cord were CD3+CD4+ T cells. Both Th17 and Treg subpopulations were analyzed by immunofluorescence. Treg cells in the spinal cord were transiently up-regulated, followed by an imbalance towards Th17 afterwards, and elevated IL-17/IL-17A levels were observed in both blood and spinal cord. Meanwhile, TGF-β, IL-6, and IL-23, the factors which regulate Th17/Treg differentiation, increased their expressions during the development of BCP. Additionally, IL-17A receptor (IL-17AR) was found to be expressed on microglia, and the level of IL-17AR increased with activated microglia during BCP development. Furthermore, BCP was ameliorated when IL-17/IL-17A neutralizing antibodies were intrathecally injected, accompanied with inhibited Th17/Treg infiltration and suppressed microglial activation. In conclusion, T cells infiltrated into the spinal cord with the imbalance of Th17/Treg towards Th17 during the development of BCP, which could promote the microglial activation and further increased BCP, while neutralizing IL-17/IL-17A in the spinal cord could ameliorate BCP. Our results suggest that targeting the imbalanced Th17/Treg infiltration in the spinal cord could be a novel strategy for BCP therapy.",Large-scale study of Toxoplasma and Cytomegalovirus shows an association between infection and serious psychiatric disorders.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30685531,"Brain, behavior, and immunity",2019 02 12,"Common infectious pathogens have been associated with psychiatric disorders, self-violence and risk-taking behavior.",MicroRNA-146a protects against cognitive decline induced by surgical trauma by suppressing hippocampal neuroinflammation in mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30685530,"Brain, behavior, and immunity",2019 04 29,"Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is a common postoperative complication that is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. However, the neuropathogenesis of this complication remains largely unknown. Neuroinflammation, in particular hippocampal inflammation, contributes to POCD. Recently, increasing evidence has supported the involvement of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the regulation of neuroinflammation in human neurological disorders. In the present study, we investigated the role of miR-146a, a key regulator of the innate immune response, in surgery-induced hippocampal inflammation and cognitive impairment. The expression of miR-146a was measured in BV-2 microglial cells stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and hippocampal tissues of mice with POCD. Loss of function and overexpression studies were performed via transfection with miR-146a mimic/inhibitor in cultured BV-2 cell lines and intrahippocampal injection of miR-146a agomir/antagomir before surgery/anesthesia to identify the role of miR-146a in neuroinflammation and cognitive impairment. QPCR, Western blot and ELISA were used to determine the expression levels of downstream adaptor proteins and proinflammatory cytokines. Immunofluorescence staining was applied to evaluate the activation of microglia. Increased expression of miR-146a was observed in BV-2 microglial cells stimulated with LPS and hippocampal tissues of mice with POCD. Modulation of miR-146a expression via transfection of microglia with miR-146a mimic or inhibitor regulated the mRNA and protein expression levels of downstream targets of miR-146a (IRAK1 and TRAF6) as well as the release of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6). In addition, overexpression of miR-146a attenuated hippocampus-dependent learning and memory impairment in mice with POCD, which was accompanied by decreased expression of the IRAK1/TRAF6/nuclear factor (NF)-κB pathway and downregulation of microglial activation in the hippocampus. Conversely, knockdown of miR-146a expression may exacerbate hippocampus-dependent learning and memory deficiency and hippocampal inflammation in mice with POCD. Collectively, our findings demonstrate the important role of miR-146a in the neuropathogenesis of POCD and suggest that miR-146a may be a potential therapeutic target for POCD.",Cancer treatment effects on cognition and depression: The moderating role of physical activity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30685529,"Breast (Edinburgh, Scotland)",2019 03 10,"Breast cancer survivors report significant cognitive impairments post treatment, particularly following chemotherapy. Depression may also occur post treatment and may partially mediate the effects of cancer treatment on cognition. Additionally, physical activity has been shown to mitigate treatment effects on cognition and depression. This study examined the role of depression in mediating the effects of cancer treatment on cognitive function (perceived cognitive impairment, PCI; perceived cognitive ability, PCA) in breast cancer survivors and explored the role of physical activity in moderating these effects.","Identification of 3-(benzazol-2-yl)quinoxaline derivatives as potent anticancer compounds: Privileged structure-based design, synthesis, and bioactive evaluation in vitro and in vivo.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30685528,European journal of medicinal chemistry,2019 03 21,"Inspired by the common structural characteristics of numerous known antitumor compounds targeting DNA or topoisomerase I, 3-(benzazol-2-yl)-quinoxaline-based scaffold was designed via the combination of two important privileged structure units -quinoxaline and benzazole. Thirty novel 3-(benzazol-2-yl)-quinoxaline derivatives were synthesized and evaluated for their biological activities. The MTT assay indicated that most compounds possessed moderate to potent antiproliferation effects against MGC-803, HepG2, A549, HeLa, T-24 and WI-38 cell lines. 3-(Benzoxazol- -2-yl)-2-(N-3-dimethylaminopropyl)aminoquinoxaline (12a) exhibited the most potent cytotoxicity, with IC50 values ranging from 1.49 to 10.99 μM against the five tested cancer and one normal cell line. Agarose-gel electrophoresis assays suggested that 12a did not interact with intact DNA, but rather it strongly inhibited topoisomerase I (Topo I) via Topo I-mediated DNA unwinding to exert its anticancer activity. The molecular modeling study indicated that 12a adopt a unique mode to interact with DNA and Topo I. Detailed biological study of 12a in MGC-803 cells revealed that 12a could arrest the cell cycle in G2 phase, inducing the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), the fluctuation of intracellular Ca2+, and the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm). Western Blot analysis indicated that 12a-treatment could significantly up-regulate the levels of pro-apoptosis proteins Bak, Bax, and Bim, down-regulate anti-apoptosis proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl, and increase levels of cyclin B1 and CDKs inhibitor p21, cytochrome c, caspase-3, caspase-9 and their activated form in MGC-803 cells in a dose-dependent manner to induce cell apoptosis via a caspase-dependent intrinsic mitochondria-mediated pathway. Studies in MGC-803 xenograft tumors models demonstrated that 12a could signiﬁcantly reduce tumor growth in vivo at doses as low as 6 mg/kg with low toxicity. Its convenient preparation and potent anticancer efficacy in vivo makes the 3-(benzazol-2-yl)quinoxaline scaffold a promising new chemistry entity for the development of novel chemotherapeutic agents."

This process can be either supported or hindered by adolescents' family context. The present study used a six-process model of personal identity including the five identity processes described by the dual-cycle model of identity (exploration in breadth, commitment making, exploration in depth, identification with commitment, and ruminative exploration) as well as a sixth identity process of reconsideration of commitment, commonly described in the three-factor model of identity.

All studies were restricted to unidirectional associations. The present study evaluated the reciprocal associations between emotional clarity and depression symptoms. Additionally, we tested the role of rumination as a mediator of the links between depression symptoms and emotional clarity.","Hand function, not proximity, biases visuotactile integration later in object processing: An ERP study.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30685514,Consciousness and cognition,2019 02 19,"Behavioral studies document a functional hand proximity effect: objects near the palm, but not the back of the hand, affect visual processing. Although visuotactile bimodal neurons integrate visual and haptic inputs, their receptive fields in monkey cortex encompass the whole hand, not just the palm. Using ERPs, we investigated whether hand function influenced the topology of integrated space around the hand. In a visual detection paradigm, target and non-target stimuli appeared equidistantly in front or in back of the hand. Equivalent N1 amplitudes were found for both conditions. P3 target versus non-target amplitude differences were greater for palm conditions. Hand proximity biased processing of visual targets equidistant from the hand early in processing. However, hand function biases emerged later when targets were selected for potential action. Thus, early hand proximity effects on object processing depend on sensory-reliant neural responses, whereas later multisensory integration depend more on the hand's functional expertise.","Translating experimental paradigms into individual-differences research: Contributions, challenges, and practical recommendations.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30685513,Consciousness and cognition,2019 02 19,"Psychological science has long been cleaved by a fundamental divide between researchers who experimentally manipulate variables and those who measure existing individual-differences. Increasingly, however, researchers are appreciating the value of integrating these approaches. Here, we used visual attention research as a case-in-point for how this gap can be bridged. Traditionally, researchers have predominately adopted experimental approaches to investigating visual attention. Increasingly, however, researchers are integrating individual-differences approaches with experimental approaches to answer novel and innovative research questions. However, individual differences research challenges some of the core assumptions and practices of experimental research. The purpose of this review, therefore, is to provide a timely summary and discussion of the key issues. While these are contextualised in the field of visual attention, the discussion of these issues has implications for psychological research more broadly. In doing so, we provide eight practical recommendations for proposed solutions and novel avenues for research moving forward.",Ignorance is strength: May human mind's unique capabilities stem from its limitations?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30685512,Consciousness and cognition,2019 02 19,"Radical views on heuristics and biases, and more generally, non-optimal patterns of human judgement, construe them either as an unwelcome mental handicap or a great evolution-based advantage.

Animals were organized into two treatment groups: PCB (n = 20); and NPCB (n = 11) stunning, both using airline pressures of 220 psi (1517 kPa). All bulls shot with PCB (n = 20/20) had patterns of EEG activity that were inconsistent with consciousness. Of the cattle shot with NPCB 82% (n = 9/11) showed waveforms suggesting complete unconsciousness. After stunning two NPCB bulls had periods of normal EEG activity and maintenance (Ptot, delta, theta, beta) or increased (alpha) spectral power compared to pre-treatment values, indicating incomplete concussion. The study showed that pneumatic PCB stunning was effective in rendering all bulls unconscious, while NPCB was less effective. This highlights the potential animal welfare risks associated with NPCB compared to PCB stunning of mature bulls in commercial abattoirs.",A volatilomics approach for off-line discrimination of minced beef and pork meat and their admixture using HS-SPME GC/MS in tandem with multivariate data analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30685510,Meat science,2019 03 19,"Beef, pork and mixed (70% beef and 30% pork) minced meat samples were obtained from a meat processing plant in Athens during a two-year survey and analyzed both microbiologically and by headspace solid-phase microextraction in combination with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (HS-SPME/GC-MS). A validated method for the discrimination of minced meat was developed based on the volatile fingerprints. Unsupervised (PCA) and supervised (PLS-DA) multivariate statistical methods were applied to visualize, group and classify the samples. The data-set was divided 70% for model calibration and 30% for model prediction. During model calibration 99, 100 and 100% of the samples were correctly classified as beef, pork and mixed meat samples, respectively, while for model prediction the respective percentages were 100, 100 and 95% respectively. In both datasets, the overall correct classification rate amounted to 99% on average. Among the volatile compounds identified, heptanal, octanal, butanol, pentanol, hexanol, octanol, 1-penten-3-ol, 2-octen-1-ol, 3-hydroxy-2-butanone, 2-butanone and 2-heptanone were positively correlated with beef samples. Furthermore, pentanal, hexanal, decanal, nonanal, benzaldehyde, trans-2-hexenal, trans-2-heptenal, trans-2-octenal and 1-octen-3-one were positively correlated with pork. Lastly, the alcohols, 2-butanol and 1-octen-3-ol showed positive correlation with mixed samples.

In vitro nitrite scavenging activity (pH 6.0) of fermented soy sauce (10 mg/mL) was 13.2%. Within selected concentrations (10-100 mg/mL), in vitro nitrite scavenging activity and total phenol content of fermented soy sauce were highly dose-dependent (P < 0.001). In pork sausage model containing 120 mg/kg of NaNO2, fermented soy sauce resulted in significantly lower residual nitrite content (35.28 mg/kg) compared to only NaNO2 addition (40.12 mg/kg) at initial storage. During 4 weeks of cold storage, however, fermented soy sauce showed little effect on the residual nitrite content. This study indicates that fermented soy sauce could initially contribute to reduce residual nitrite content, and the nitrite scavenging impact of fermented soy sauce was less effective in the pork sausage model than in vitro evaluation.",Mating-type loci of Ustilago esculenta are essential for mating and development.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30685508,Fungal genetics and biology : FG & B,2019 03 22,"Ustilago esculenta is closely related to the smut fungus Ustilago maydis and, in an endophytic-like life in the plant Zizania latifolia, only infects host stems and causes swollen stems to form edible galls called Jiaobai in China. In order to study its different modes of invasion and sites of symptom development from other smut fungi at the molecular level, we first characterized the a and b mating-type loci of U. esculenta. The a loci contained three a mating-type alleles, encoding two pheromones and one pheromone receptor per allele. The pheromone/receptor system controlled the conjugation formation, the initial step of mating, in which each pheromone was specific for recognition by only one mating partner. In addition, there are at least three b alleles identified in U. esculenta, encoding two subunits of heterodimeric homeodomain transcription factors bE and bW, responsible for hyphal growth and invasiveness. Hyphal formation, elongation and invasion after mating of two compatible partners occurred, only when a heterodimer complex was formed by the bE and bW proteins derived from different alleles. We also demonstrated that even with only one paired pheromone-pheromone receptor, the active b locus heterodimer triggered hyphal growth and infection.",Survival with Parenchymal and Pleural Invasion of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancers Less than 30 mm.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30685507,Journal of thoracic oncology : official publication of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer,2019 04 27,To determine long-term survival of visceral pleural invasion (VPI) and parenchymal invasion (PAI) (angiolymphatic and/or vascular) on survival of NSCLCs less than 30 mm in maximum diameter.

GM neurons, postulated to exist here, are hypothesised to participate in regulatory functions, such as the central control of feeding and metabolism. In the present experiments, GM neurons were identified and examined in the ACC by means of the multibarreled microelectrophoretic technique. After bilateral ACC microinjection of streptozotocin (STZ), glucose tolerance tests (GTTs), and determination of relevant plasma metabolite concentrations were performed. Body weights were measured at regular time points during the GTT experiment. Ten percent of the neurons - 30 of 282 recorded cells - responded to the administration of D-glucose, thus, declared to be the GM units. The peak values and dynamics of the GTT blood glucose curves, the plasma metabolite concentrations, and the weight gain were pathologically altered in the STZ treated animals. Our recording experiments revealed the existence of GM neurons in the anterior cingulate cortex. STZ induced selective destruction of these chemosensory cells resulted in feeding and metabolic alterations. The present findings indicate distinguished significance of the cingulate cortical GM neurons in adaptive processes of maintenance of the homeostatic balance.",Uridine treatment prevents REM sleep deprivation-induced learning and memory impairment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30685492,Neuroscience research,2019 02 04,"Previous studies have shown that sleep plays an important role in cognitive functions and sleep deprivation impairs learning and memory. Uridine is the main pyrimidine nucleoside found in human blood circulation and has beneficial effects on cognitive functions. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of uridine administration on learning and memory impairment in sleep-deprived rats. Flower pot method was used to induce REM sleep deprivation. Uridine-treated groups received 1 mmol/kg uridine and control groups received 1 ml/kg saline (0.9% NaCl) twice a day for four days and once a day on the 5th day intraperitoneally. Learning and memory performances were measured using Morris water maze (MWM) test. We also measured the ratios of total calcium-calmodulin dependent kinase II (tCaMKII)/β-tubulin and phosphorylated cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) response element binding protein (pCREB)/β-tubulin, long-term potentiation (LTP) related molecules, using western blot analysis on the hippocampus. The results showed that REM sleep deprivation impaired learning and memory and also decreased the ratios of tCaMKII and pCREB. Uridine treatment enhanced learning and memory parameters in REM sleep-deprived rats. Additionally, decreases in tCaMKII and pCREB were prevented by uridine treatment. These data suggest that administration of uridine for five consecutive days prevents REM sleep deprivation-induced deficits in learning and memory associated with enhanced tCaMKII and pCREB ratios in the hippocampus.",Regional and temporal regulation and role of somatostatin receptor subtypes in the mouse brain following systemic kainate-induced acute seizures.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30685491,Neuroscience research,2019 02 09,"Somatostatin reduces neuronal excitability via somatostatin receptors (Sst1-Sst5) and inhibits seizure activity. However, the expression status of the Sst subtypes in epileptic mice and their role in the antiepileptic effects of somatostatin remain unclear. Here, we show that the Sst subtypes are regulated differently by epileptic neuronal activity in mice. Systemic kainate injection rapidly and transiently elevated the Sst2 and Sst3 mRNA and reduced Sst1 and Sst4 mRNA in the hippocampus; however, among all the subtypes, only Sst2 mRNA was increased in the excitatory neurons of the basolateral amygdala, accompanied by a decrease in the level of Sst2 protein. Following kainate administration, recovery from seizure was delayed by reduced expression of Sst2 in the basolateral amygdala, but not in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus; higher expression levels of Bdnf, a neuronal activity marker, were observed in both conditions. These results suggest that Sst2 contributes to seizure termination by feedback inhibition in the amygdala. This could be a potential therapeutic target for acute seizures.",Withaferin A-mediated apoptosis in breast cancer cells is associated with alterations in mitochondrial dynamics.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30685490,Mitochondrion,2019 02 23,"Withaferin A (WA), a steroidal lactone derived from a medicinal plant (Withania somnifera), inhibits cancer development in transgenic and chemically-induced rodent models of breast cancer but the underlying mechanism is not fully grasped. We have shown previously that WA treatment causes apoptotic cell death in human breast cancer cells that is preceded by inhibition of complex III of the mitochondrial electron transport chain. This study extends these observations to now demonstrate alterations in mitochondrial dynamics in WA-induced apoptosis. Assembly of complex III was decreased in MCF-7 and SUM159 cells but not in MDA-MB-231 as determined by native blue gel electrophoresis. Because WA is a Michael acceptor (electrophile), we explored the possibility of whether it covalently modifies cysteine residue(s) in ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase, Rieske iron-sulfur polypeptide 1 (UQCRFS1). Covalent modification of cysteine in UQCRFS1 was not observed after WA treatment. Instead, WA treatment inhibited chemically-induced mitochondrial fusion and decreased the mitochondrial volume, and this effect was accompanied by a decrease in the expression of proteins involved in fusion process, including mitofusin1, mitofusin2, and full-length optic atrophy protein 1 (OPA1). A loss of volume in fragmented mitochondria also occurred in WA-exposed cells when compared to vehicle-treated control. WA treatment also caused a decrease in protein level of mitochondrial fission-regulating protein dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1). Functional studies revealed that DRP1 deficiency and OPA1 knockdown attenuated apoptotic potential of WA. Taken together, these results indicate that WA not only alters Complex III assembly but also inhibits mitochondrial dynamics in breast cancer cells.","Laparoscopic versus open pancreatoduodenectomy for pancreatic or periampullary tumours (LEOPARD-2): a multicentre, patient-blinded, randomised controlled phase 2/3 trial.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30685489,The lancet.

This space has a key functional role as it is where all physical interactions with objects in the environment occur. Here I describe how multisensory neurons in a specific fronto-parietal network map the PPS by integrating tactile stimuli on the body with visual or auditory information related to external objects specifically when they are close to the body. I show how PPS representation is not only multisensory, but actually multisensory-motor, as the PPS system interacts with motor areas to trigger appropriate responses. The extent of PPS is not fixed, but it is shaped by experience, as PPS may encompass farther portions of space, once the individual has interacted with them, (e.g., with tools), or it contracts, if interactions are limited because of external constraints, body, or brain injury. Interactions between the individual and the environment are not only physical but may also be ""abstract"". Recent data show that PPS adapts as a consequence of technology-mediated or social interactions. Finally, I propose that besides low-level sensory-motor representations of the space around the different parts of the body, mediating body-objects interactions, the multisensory PPS system also underlies a general representation of the self as distinct from the environment and the others. PPS thus supports self-location, contributes to bodily self-consciousness and mediates higher-level cognitive functions.",The psychological scars of suicide: Accounting for how risk for suicidal behavior is heightened by its past occurrence.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30685485,Neuroscience and biobehavioral reviews,2019 05 25,"Not only is suicidal behavior strongly predicted by its past occurrence, but the risk for recurrence appears to increase with each subsequent attempt. The current paper discusses a potential explanation for this phenomenon, that suicide attempts may leave a residual psychological scar that heightens risk for future attempts. This possibility is evaluated against two alternatives: (i) risk for first and subsequent suicide attempts is accounted for by a shared diathesis pre-existing the first lifetime attempt, and (ii) different rates of developmental decline in risk factors account for differences in prospective number of attempts. In this discussion, a formalized conceptual framework of psychological scarring is presented, along with considerations of particular relevance to its study. Finally, the clinical implications of determining the processes underlying the association between suicide attempts and heightened risk for recurrence are discussed.",Cortical and subcortical contributions to context-control learning.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30685484,Neuroscience and biobehavioral reviews,2019 05 25,"""Cognitive control"" describes our ability to strategically bias information processing in line with internal goals. Traditionally, research has focused on delineating the sources of top-down biasing, implicating the lateral prefrontal cortex.

Here, we review and synthesize recent research into the cognitive and neural mechanisms of this type of ""context-control learning"". We first discuss a fast-growing cognitive psychology literature documenting how specific cognitive control states can become associated with, and subsequently triggered by, contextual cues. We then review neuroimaging studies that speak to the neural substrates of contextual adjustments in control, with a particular focus on recent work that explicitly modeled context-control learning processes. We conclude that these studies suggest an important subcortical extension of the traditional frontal control network, as they indicate a key role for the caudate nucleus in forming associations between contextual cues and appropriate control settings.",Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and task-related heart rate variability: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30685483,Neuroscience and biobehavioral reviews,2019 05 25,"Research suggests that Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is associated with autonomic nervous system dysregulation, but the findings were mixed."

HIIT involves alternating periods of high intensity aerobic exercise with light recovery exercise or no exercise, allowing for greater physiological stimulus and adaptation than moderate intensity continuous training (MICT) for cardiorespiratory fitness and other cardiometabolic processes. However, there is no universal criteria or framework for the prescription and monitoring of HIIT in clinical populations, and safety concerns remain a common barrier for implementing HIIT as standard care. Historically, exercise intensity has been prescribed using heart rate (HR) targets derived from either a predicted maximal HR (HRmax) or from an attempt to objectively measure HRmax. However, using this approach alone has a number of limitations. Here we provide guidelines to improve the delivery of HIIT in cardiometabolic populations using 1) a framework for HIIT prescription using a combination of objective and subjective measures of exercise intensity, and 2) clinical considerations for assessment and monitoring to maximize patient safety. The framework involves an individualized step-by-step process to calculate, validate, and calibrate HR target zones for HIIT training to allow for appropriate workload prescription and progression. We strongly recommend this framework be used in future clinical trials investigating HIIT.",Implementing behaviour change theory and techniques to increase physical activity and prevent functional decline among adults aged 61-70: The PreventIT project.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30685469,Progress in cardiovascular diseases,2019 04 16,"The health and wellbeing benefits of engaging in physical activity (PA), and of improving strength and balance, are well documented. The World Health Organization's recommendations of 150 min per week of moderate intensity physical activity have been adopted across the world in policy and practice recommendations. However, the number of older adults engaging in this level of PA remains low. The European Project, PreventIT, has adapted the Lifestyle-integrated Functional Exercise (LiFE) programme, which reduced falls in people 75 years and over, for a younger cohort (aLiFE). aLiFE incorporates challenging strength and balance/agility tasks, as well as specific recommendations for increasing physical activity and reducing sedentary behaviour in young-older adults, aged 60-70 years. Personalised advice is given on how to integrate strength, balance and physical activities into daily life. aLiFE has been further developed to be delivered using smartphones and smartwatches (eLiFE), providing the opportunity to send timely motivational messages and real-time feedback to the user. Both aLiFE and eLiFE are behaviour change interventions, supporting older adults to form long-term physical activity habits. PreventIT has taken the original LiFE concept and further developed the behaviour change elements, explicitly mapping them to Social Cognitive Theory, Habit Formation Theory and 30 Behaviour Change Techniques (BCTs). Goal setting, planning, prompts and real-time feedback are used to deliver a person-centred experience. Over 1300 motivational messages have been written, mapped to psychological theory, BCTs and evidence regarding the importance of strength, balance and PA. A motivational assessment tool has been developed to enable us to investigate stated motivational drivers with actual performed behaviour within the feasibility Randomised Controlled Trial. The PreventIT mHealth intervention focusses on behaviour change from initiation to long-term maintenance, addressing the different phases of adopting a healthier lifestyle. As such, it makes a strong contribution to the developing field of evidence-based mobile health (mHealth).","Testosterone, cortisol, and status-striving personality features: A review and empirical evaluation of the Dual Hormone hypothesis.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30685468,Hormones and behavior,2019 03 11,"Decades of research in behavioral endocrinology has implicated the gonadal hormone testosterone in the regulation of mating effort, often expressed in primates in the form of aggressive and/or status-striving behavior. Based on the idea that neuroendocrine axes influence each other, recent work among humans has proposed that links between testosterone and indices of status-striving are rendered conditional by the effects of glucocorticoids. The Dual Hormone hypothesis is one particular instance of this argument, predicting that cortisol blocks the effects of testosterone on dominance, aggression, and risk-taking in humans. Support for the Dual Hormone hypothesis is wide-ranging, but considerations of theoretical ambiguity, null findings, and low statistical power pose problems for interpreting the published literature. Here, we contribute to the development of the Dual Hormone hypothesis by (1) critically reviewing the extant literature-including p-curve analyses of published findings; and, (2) ""opening the file drawer"" and examining relationships between testosterone, cortisol, and status-striving personality features in seven previously published studies from our laboratories (total N = 718; median N per feature = 318) that examined unrelated predictions. Results from p-curve suggest that published studies have only 16% power to detect effects, while our own data show no robust interactions between testosterone and cortisol in predicting status-striving personality features. We discuss the implications of these results for the Dual Hormone hypothesis, limitations of our analyses, and the development of future research.",Anti-inflammatory effect of a novel synthetic compound 1-((4-fluorophenyl)thio)isoquinoline in RAW264.7 macrophages and a zebrafish model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30685466,Fish & shellfish immunology,2019 03 22,"The compound, 1-((4-fluorophenyl)thio)isoquinoline (FPTQ), is a synthetic isoquinoline derivative. To test the anti-inflammatory effect of FPTQ, we used neutrophil-specific transgenic zebrafish Tg(mpx::EGFP)i114 line and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW264.7 cells. We also used two different methods, involving tail transection and LPS stimulation in the zebrafish model. Neutrophils translocation in the zebrafish tail-transected model was inhibited by FPTQ. Neutrophil aggregation was also inhibited by FPTQ in the LPS-stimulated zebrafish model. Decreased mRNA expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokine genes, interleukin-1β (il-1β) and interleukin-6 (il-6), was found in zebrafish larvae injected with FPTQ. Additionally, production of nitric oxide was inhibited by FPTQ in RAW264.7 macrophage cells treated with LPS. Moreover, the mRNA expression of Il-1β and Il-6 suppressed by FPTQ treatment in RAW264.7 macrophage cells, and an enzyme immunoassay showed that FPTQ suppressed the secretion of IL-1β and IL-6 in RAW264.7 cells. These results demonstrate that FPTQ reduced inflammatory responses and, therefore, suggest that it may be effective as an anti-inflammatory agent.","B52 promotes alternative splicing of Dscam in Chinese mitten crab, Eriocheir sinensis.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30685464,Fish & shellfish immunology,2019 03 22,"B52 is a member of the classical serine/arginine (SR)-rich proteins, which are phylogenetically conserved and play significant roles in mRNA maturation, including alternative splicing. In the present study, the docking site, selector sequences and locus control region of the Chinese mitten crab (Eriocheir sinensis) Down syndrome cell adhesion molecule (EsDscam) were identified. Alternative splicing of Dscam is essential to generate different isoforms. We also isolated and characterised the B52 gene from E. sinensis (EsB52). The 876 bp open reading frame of EsB52 encodes a 291 amino acid residue polypeptide, and EsB52 has two RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) at the N-terminus and an arginine/serine-rich domain at the C-terminus. Each RRM contains two degenerate short submotifs, RNP-1 and RNP2. Analysis of tissue distribution revealed that EsB52 mRNA expression was widespread in all tested tissues, and especially high in brain and hemocytes. In hemocytes, EsB52 was upregulated significantly after stimulation with pathogen-associated molecular patterns and bacteria. Furthermore, EsB52 RNAi decreased the number of Ig7 inclusion in mRNA rather than Ig2 or Ig3. Taken together, these findings suggest that EsB52 acts as an alternative splicing activator of EsDscam.",Antimicrobial susceptibility of Burkholderia pseudomallei isolates in the Northern Vietnam.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30685463,Journal of global antimicrobial resistance,2019 01 27,Antimicrobial suceptibility pattern of clinical Burkholderia pseudomallei in Vietnam has not reported since the first publication in 2008.

This has increased the focus on targeted therapeutic strategies such as monoclonal antibody-based cancer therapies. The major advantage of antibody-based therapies is the specific inhibition of cancer-related targets, with reduced off-target side effects. Anterior gradient-2 (AGR2) is a prometastatic and proangiogenic tumor marker that is overexpressed in multiple cancers. Therefore, anti-AGR2 antibodies may be potential therapeutic agents for treating different cancers. In the present study, we examined a novel anti-AGR2 monoclonal antibody mAb18A4 and found that this antibody inhibited lung cancer progression and metastasis without exerting any adverse side effects on the major organs and blood in mice. Moreover, we found that mAb18A4 activated p53 pathway and attenuated ERK1/2-MAPK pathway. Furthermore, mAb18A4-treated cancer cell lines showed attenuated proliferation and colony formation, enhanced apoptosis, increased p53 expression, and reduced phosphorylated ERK1/2 expression. Treatment with mAb18A4 significantly reduced tumor size and suppressed tumor metastasis in and increased the survival of different xenograft tumor models. In addition, mAb18A4 potently suppressed AGR2-induced angiogenesis.

Continuous bite monitoring through direct observation was implemented in 12 Criollo goats (adults, non-pregnant) foraging for 4 h per day during the rainy season. In the first Period (P1, one observation point) all goats were maintained with natural GIN infection. In the second Period (P2, three observation points), goats were equally distributed into 2 groups: i) moxidectin treated group (TG) used in a suppressive scheme; and ii) naturally infected group (IG). For each observation point, goats were monitored at three timepoints per day (80 min each), for three consecutive days, to estimate their intake of dry matter (DM), condensed tannins (CT), crude protein, metabolizable energy and digestible DM. Live weight (LW), faecal samples and blood samples were obtained every 28 days to determine LW change, faecal egg counts (FEC) and packed cell volume (PCV). During P1 and P2, the TG and IG had similar LW change and PCV. During both periods, the intake of DM, CT and all macronutrients were similar for TG and IG. The suppression of GIN infection did not modify the feeding behaviour of goats. Therefore, a therapeutic self-medicative behaviour was not identified in Criollo goats browsing a TDF."

The α form can change to β form on exposure to high humidity that can occur during manufacturing, stability, and in-use period. It is critical to maintain α form of the drug in a drug product to avoid variability in clinical response. U.S. Food and Drug Administration dissolution method was found to be nondiscriminatory for RFX formulations containing either 100% α or β form. The objective of this study was to develop a discriminatory dissolution method that can detect low levels of α to β transformation in RFX products. Formulations containing a variable fraction of α and β forms were prepared by using direct compression method. Dissolution parameters investigated were type of dissolution medium (water and phosphate buffer), volume (500, 900, and 1000 mL), and paddle speed (50, 75, and 150 rpm). Dissolution in water with 0.2% sodium lauryl sulfate was less than 80% and nondiscriminatory. However, dissolution tested in a phosphate buffer pH 7.4 with 0.2% sodium lauryl sulfate at 50 rpm was discriminatory with more than 17.5% difference in dissolution profile between formulations containing α and β forms. The developed method can detect polymorphic transformation if there is 25% or more β form conversion.",Influx and Efflux Transporters Contribute to the Increased Dermal Exposure to Active Metabolite of Regorafenib After Repeated Oral Administration in Mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30685396,Journal of pharmaceutical sciences,2019 05 24,"The multikinase inhibitor regorafenib, which is a standard treatment for certain cancer patients after disease progression following other approved therapies, exhibits delayed-onset dermal toxicity. Here, we aimed to clarify the mechanisms that contribute to the increased dermal exposure to active metabolite M-5 of regorafenib after repeated oral administration. The dermal concentration of M-5 at 24 h after the last 5 oral administrations of regorafenib in mdr1a/1b/bcrp-/- mice was more than 190 times that in wild-type mice. The skin-to-plasma concentration ratio of M-5 in mdr1a/1b/bcrp-/- was also higher than in wild-type mice, suggesting possible involvement of P-glycoprotein and breast cancer resistance protein in regulating the dermal distribution. The area under the plasma concentration-time curve values of M-5 and its precursor M-2 in plasma of mdr1a/1b/bcrp-/- were at most 26 and 3 times those in wild-type mice, respectively. Interestingly, repeated administration of regorafenib markedly increased the area under the plasma concentration-time curve of M-5 in plasma, but not liver, compared with a single dose. Intravenous administration of M-5 dose-dependently reduced the liver-to-plasma concentration ratio. Our results indicate that hepatic uptake of M-5 may partially explain the accumulation of M-5 in the systemic circulation, but multiple factors, including influx and efflux transporters, are involved in determining dermal exposure to M-5.",Alterations in body mass index and waist-to-hip ratio in never and minimally treated patients with psychosis: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30685395,Schizophrenia research,2019 05 31,"Obesity is up to 4 times higher in patients with schizophrenia than in the general population.

Therefore, we aimed to examine differences in obesity measures (body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR)) in antipsychotic-naive and minimally treated (up to 2 weeks of lifetime antipsychotic exposure) patients with psychosis compared to healthy controls (HCs).",Altered functional connectivity and low-frequency signal fluctuations in early psychosis and genetic high risk.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30685394,Schizophrenia research,2019 01 27,"Studying individuals at increased genetic risk for schizophrenia may generate important theories regarding the emergence of the illness. In this investigation, genetic high-risk individuals (GHR, n = 37) were assessed with functional magnetic resonance imaging and compared to individuals in the first episode of schizophrenia (FESZ, n = 42) and healthy comparison subjects (HCS, n = 59). Measures of functional connectivity and the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) were obtained in a global, data-driven analysis. The functional connectivity measure, termed degree centrality, assessed each voxel's connectivity with all the other voxels in the brain. GHR and FESZ displayed increased degree centrality globally and locally. On ALFF measures, GHR were indistinguishable from HCS in the majority of areas but resembled FESZ in insula, basal ganglia and hippocampus. FESZ evidenced reduced amplitude of the global neural signal as compared to HCS and GHR. Results support the hypothesis that schizophrenia diathesis involves functional connectivity and ALFF abnormalities. In addition, they further an emerging theory suggesting that increased connectivity and metabolism may be involved in schizophrenia vulnerability and early stages of the illness.",Gut permeability and mimicry of the Glutamate Ionotropic Receptor NMDA type Subunit Associated with protein 1 (GRINA) as potential mechanisms related to a subgroup of people with schizophrenia with elevated antigliadin antibodies (AGA IgG).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30685393,Schizophrenia research,2019 05 31,"About one third of people with schizophrenia have elevated IgG antibodies to gliadin (AGA IgG) and increased inflammation. Understanding the mechanism by which this immune response occurs is critical to the development of personalized treatments. We examined gut permeability and mimicry to the glutamate receptor as possible mechanisms related to high gliadin antibodies (AGA IgG) seen in some people with schizophrenia. The Glutamate Ionotropic Receptor NMDA type Subunit Associated with protein 1 (GRINA) has a similar protein structure to gliadin representing a potential target for cross reactivity or mimicry. In a population of schizophrenia subjects (N = 160) and healthy controls (N = 80) we analyzed serum samples for both GRINA and Anti-Saccharomyces Cerevisiae antibodies (ASCA), related to gut permeability. Schizophrenia patients compared to controls had a higher prevalence of positivity to ASCA IgA (p = 0.004) and IgG (p < 0.001). Multinomial logistic regression showed an association between AGA IgG and ASCA IgG in schizophrenia (p = 0.05 for the estimated regression coefficient) but not in healthy controls (p = 0.13). GRINA IgG was higher in schizophrenia patients than in healthy controls (0.43 ± 0.30 vs. 0.22 ± 0.24, p < 0.001). Logistic regressions showed an association between AGA IgG and GRINA IgG in schizophrenia (p = 0.016 for the estimated regression coefficient) but not for the controls (p = 0.471). Thus, we propose that mimicry through the presence of cross-reactivity between gliadin and GRINA might disrupt the functions of the glutamate system and relate to illness pathophysiology in those with schizophrenia and elevated AGA IgG.",P300 amplitude attenuation in high risk and early onset psychosis youth.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30685392,Schizophrenia research,2019 01 27,"Little research has investigated the use of electrophysiological biomarkers in childhood and adolescence to distinguish early onset psychosis and the clinical high risk state. The P300 evoked potential is a robust neurophysiological marker of schizophrenia that is dampened in patients with schizophrenia and, less consistently, in those with affective psychoses and those at clinical high risk for psychosis (CHR). How it may differ between patients with psychotic disorders (PS) and CHR is less studied, especially in youth. The current study compared P300 activity among children and adolescents, aged 5-18 years, at CHR (n = 43), with PS (n = 28), and healthy controls (HC; n = 24). Participants engaged in an auditory event-related potential (ERP) task to elicit a P300 response and completed clinical interviews to verify symptoms and diagnoses. Linear regression analyses revealed a decrease in P300 amplitude with increased severity of psychotic symptoms. PS participants showed a diminished P300 response compared to those at CHR and HC, particularly among adolescents aged 13-18. This response was most evident at centroparietal and parietal locations in the right hemisphere. The findings suggest that high risk and psychotic symptomatology is linked to attenuated parietal P300 activity in youth as young as 13 years. Further exploration of the P300 as a biomarker for psychosis in very young patients could inform tailored, appropriate interventions at early stages of disease progression. Future research should evaluate whether specific phenotypic and genotypic characteristics are differentially associated with neurophysiological biomarkers and whether P300 attenuation in CHR youth can predict later symptom severity.",Comparing the diagnostic efficacy of intraoral radiography and cone beam computed tomography volume registration in the detection of mandibular alveolar bone defects.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30685391,"Oral surgery, oral medicine, oral pathology and oral radiology",2019 01 27,The aim of this study was to (1) compare bone loss detection accuracy with intraoral radiography and registered cone beam computed tomography (CBCT); (2) assess repeatability with both modalities; (3) determine factors affecting defect detection; and (4) determine the effect of buccolingual bone thickness on defect detection.,Dental and craniofacial alterations in long-term survivors of childhood head and neck rhabdomyosarcoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30685390,"Oral surgery, oral medicine, oral pathology and oral radiology",2019 03 29,"Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) represents the most common soft tissue sarcoma that affects children.

Vancomycin-Resistant Enterococci (VRE) are increasingly prevalent nasocomial pathogens worldwide and they rarely cause infections to the central nervous system. Daptomycin is a cyclic lipopeptide effective antibiotic due to its rapid bactericidal effect. It is a life-saving treatment option for meningitis, bacteriemia, sepsis, endocarditis and urinary system infections caused by VRE. Here, we presented a 2.5-month-old male patient diagnosed with ventriculoperitoneal shunt infection caused by VRE faecium. This is the first pediatric VP shunt infection caused by VRE and treated with a combination of intravenous (IV) linezolid IV and intraventricular (IVT) daptomycin. The patient was admitted to the medical center with the complaint of umbilical discharge and shunt revision was applied with the thought of shunt dysfunction. Intermittent umbilical cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage continued and the patient developed fever 2 weeks after the operation.

Peptidoglycan (PG) plays an important role in maintenance of cell division, cell wall integrity and pathogenesis. Mycobacterium smegmatis MSMEG_6281, a peptidoglycan amidase, is vital for mycobacterial cell division. However, the effects of MSMEG_6281on cell wall integrity and mycobacterial virulence remain unknown. In the current study, we demonstrate that MSMEG_6281gene knockout in M.smegmatis alters the microbiological characteristics. Our results revealed that MSMEG_6281gene knockout bacteria (M. sm-ΔM_6281) lost their acid-fastness, increased their sensitivity to lipophilic compounds and presented an abnormal morphology. Our results revealed that MSMEG_6281was related to maintaining the cell wall integrity. Furthermore, we investigated the effects of MSMEG_6281 inactivation on mycobacterial virulence using mice models infected by different M.smegmatis strains. MSMEG_6281 inactivation in the M sm-ΔM_6281 infected group caused less mycobacterial colonization, reduced pathological signs, decreased the anti-microbial enzymes production including iNOS and β-defensins in mouse lungs. Moreover, IL-1β and TLR2 expression were significantly down-regulated, while the production of IFN-γ and TNF-α was up-regulated. These findings indicated the diversity of host immune responses induced by different strains of M.smegmatis, suggesting that MSMEG_6281 inactivation impact mycobacterial virulence.

Brassica oleracea is a phytochemical commonly used in the control and prevention of human and animal diseases. The use of this plant in the treatment of infectious bovine mastitis has been little referenced in the literature and its molecular mechanism of action in this disease has not been clarified yet. This study aimed to reveal, through bioinformatic analysis, the molecular mechanism of action of Brassica oleracea in bovine mastitis. We investigated genes expressed in the signaling pathways of bovine mastitis and Brassica oleracea performance and elaborated the Venn diagram. A gene network was developed using the STRING 10 database. Leader genes were identified by calculating the weighted number of links (WNL). The NetworkAnalyzer plugin for Cytoscape software was used to characterize network topology. For the visualization of highly interconnected regions in the network, the MCODE was used. The BINGO and GFD-Net plugins were used to perform the ontological analysis. The TP53 and MTOR leader genes were identified in the sub-networks of the bovine mastitis signaling pathway and Brassica oleracea performance, respectively. Topological analysis confirmed the leader condition of the genes. Although the overlap of genes in the Venn diagram was not observed, the leader genes were found to be interconnected (confidence = 0.9). In the network that interconnected the leader genes two molecular complexes were detected and the ontological analysis revealed biological processes, cellular components and important molecular functions. It was concluded that Brassica oleracea may be a promising candidate to be included in a mammalian herbal cocktail against infectious bovine mastitis by interfering in the mechanisms of action of genes such as MTOR and TP53."

The main reasons for the poor prognosis of gliomas are that limited tumor tissue that can be resected (to preserve brain functions) and that residual tumors are often resistant to irradiation and chemotherapy. Therefore, overcoming the resistance of residual tumors against adjuvant therapy is urgently needed for glioma treatment. Recent large cohort studies of genetic alterations in GBM demonstrated that both genetic information and intracellular molecular signaling are networked in gliomas and that such information may help clarify which molecules or signals serve essential roles in resistance against radiation or chemotherapy, highlighting them as potential novel therapeutic targets against refractory gliomas. In this review, we summarize the current understanding of molecular networks that govern glioma biology, mainly based on cohort studies or recent evidence, with a focus on how intracellular signaling molecules in gliomas associate with each other and regulate refractoriness against current therapy.",Role of intracoronary fibrinolytic therapy in contemporary PCI practice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30685340,Cardiovascular revascularization medicine : including molecular interventions,2019 01 27,"Plaque rupture or plaque erosion leads to intracoronary thrombus formation resulting in coronary artery occlusion and ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. Early restoration of blood flow in occluded coronary artery is the mainstay of therapy and it can be achieved by either thrombolytic therapy or primary percutaneous coronary intervention (P-PCI) or a combination of these two in many different ways. It has been proved that primary PCI is better than thrombolytic therapy in establishing early and effective recanalization of infarct related artery, reducing major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and increasing survival. There have been tremendous advances in PCI techniques over the years with newer stents, thrombectomy devices, and adjunctive pharmacotherapy. However, intracoronary thrombus continues to be the bane of interventional cardiologists. Failure of recanalization, suboptimal results, distal embolization, no reflow and impaired myocardial perfusion are some of the unresolved difficulties, regularly seen during PCI of patients with large intracoronary thrombus burden indicating an unmet need. This review focuses on emerging evidence about the usefulness of intracoronary thrombolytic therapy as an adjunct to PCI in patients with large intracoronary thrombus burden.",Safety and efficacy of stentablation with rotational atherectomy for the management of underexpanded and undilatable coronary stents.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30685339,Cardiovascular revascularization medicine : including molecular interventions,2019 01 27,"Coronary stent underexpansion is associated with in-stent restenosis and few interventions are available for the management of undilatable underexpanded stents. Stentablation (SA) with rotational atherectomy (RA) is a unique application and has previously been described with encouraging results. Data regarding SA is limited to case reports and small case series; therefore, reasonable concern persists regarding procedural safety and long-term outcomes."

While participants were presented with locally time-reversed sentences of varying temporal integrity, they performed an auditory pattern-matching task. The major aim of the study was to find out whether functional lateralization for speech perception according to the 'Asymmetric Sampling in Time' (AST) hypothesis shows a similar pattern in elderly individuals as has been previously observed in younger adults. Our findings indicate that, unlike results previously obtained from younger adults, older individuals did not demonstrate the same pattern of rightward lateralization in response to suprasegmental speech cues in the three auditory regions of interest (ROI), namely Heschl's gyrus (HG), planum temporale (PT) and posterior lateral superior temporal gyrus (pSTG). A frequentist statistical approach did not yield evidence for functional lateralization in the aging brain, and this was corroborated by Bayesian evidence which supported the absence of lateralization in older adults in response to the suprasegmental manipulation. However, a relationship between structural measurements and functional responses demonstrated that individuals with thicker right PT showed less variance in lateralization. Hence, this study extends the division of labour between the left and the right auditory cortex during the processing of continuous spoken language as proposed by the 'AST'-hypothesis in younger adults to a lifespan context.",Determining the optimal number of examined lymph nodes for accurate staging of pancreatic cancer: An analysis using the nodal staging score model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30685327,European journal of surgical oncology : the journal of the European Society of Surgical Oncology and the British Association of Surgical Oncology,2019 05 21,The aim of this study was to determine the optimal number of examined lymph nodes (ELNs) for accurate staging of pancreatic cancer using the nodal staging score model.,Patterns of recurrence and prognosis in locally advanced FIGO stage IB2 to IIB cervical cancer: Retrospective multicentre study from the FRANCOGYN group.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30685326,European journal of surgical oncology : the journal of the European Society of Surgical Oncology and the British Association of Surgical Oncology,2019 04 17,"Evidence-based data describing patterns of recurrence and prognosis in women with FIGO stage IB2 to IIB locally advanced cervical cancer (LACC) are scarce.

HD is pathologically characterized by loss of neurons in the striatum and cortex, which leads to progressive motor dysfunction, cognitive decline and behavioral symptoms. Stem cell-based therapy has emerged as a feasible therapeutic approach for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases and may be effective in alleviating and/or halting the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying HD. Several pre-clinical studies have used stem cells in animal models of HD. Here, we performed a systematic review of preclinical studies to estimate the treatment efficacy of stem cells in animal models of HD. Based on our systematic review, treatment with stem cells significantly improves neurological and behavioral outcomes in animal models of HD.

The present study aimed to compare structural and functional covariance networks (SCNs and FCNs) between remitters and nonremitters. We determined the predictive capacities of SCNs and FCNs to discriminate the two groups. Fifty TRD patients underwent a course of rTMS to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. They were categorized into remitters (n = 22) and nonremitters (n = 28) based on HDRS≤7 at the end of treatment. Baseline structural and functional magnetic imaging (sMRI and fMRI) of the patients and 42 healthy controls were collected. SCNs and FCNs were defined based on structural and functional covariance of gray mater volume (GMV) and fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (fALFF) from sMRI and fMRI, respectively. Structural/functional network integrity of these networks (default mode network [DMN], central executive network [CEN] and salience network [SN]) were compared between the three groups. In patients, associations between SCNs and FCNs with clinical improvements were studied using linear correlation analysis. Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was conducted to confirm the utility of the SCNs and FCNs in classifying clinical sub-groups. Nonremitters exhibited lower structural integrity in CEN than remitters and controls. Higher structural integrity of CEN was related to clinical improvement (r = 0.423, p = .002), and structural integrity distinguished remitters and nonremitters with a fairly high accuracy (AUC = 0.71, p = .008). No group differences or correlation with clinical changes were found in FCNs. Results suggest the CEN may play a role mediating clinical improvement in rTMS for depression. Structural covariance networks may be features to consider in prediction of clinical improvement.",Preface - Practical and theoretical considerations for performing a multi-center preclinical biomarker discovery study of post-traumatic epileptogenesis: lessons learned from the EpiBioS4Rx consortium.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30685321,Epilepsy research,2019 01 27,"The Epilepsy Bioinformatics Study for Antiepileptogenic Therapy (EpiBioS4Rx) is a NINDS funded Center-Without-Walls international study aimed at preventing epileptogenesis after traumatic brain injury (TBI). One objective of EpiBioS4Rx relates to preclinical biomarker discovery for post-traumatic epilepsy. In order to perform a statistically appropriately powered biomarker discovery study, EpiBioS4Rx has made a rigorous attempt to harmonize the preclinical procedures performed at the three EpiBioS4Rx centers, located in Finland, Australia, and the USA. Moreover, we have also performed a rigorous interim analysis of the success of procedural harmonization, which is reported in this virtual special issue. The analysis included harmonization of the production of animal model, blood sampling, electroencephalogram analyses (seizures, high-frequency oscillations) and magnetic resonance imaging analysis. Based on lessons learned, we propose a 3-stage protocol to facilitate the success of preclinical multicenter studies: preparation ⇨ testing ⇨ multicenter study. The need of funding for preparation and testing phases, which precede the actual multicenter study and are necessary for its success, should be taken into account in the design of funding schemes.",Neurochemical impact of the 5-HT2C receptor agonist WAY-163909 on monoamine tissue content in the rat brain.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30685320,Neurochemistry international,2019 05 23,"Serotonin2C receptor (5-HT2C) agonists are promising drugs for the treatment of neuropsychiatric diseases. However, their effect is not completely understood in part because they possibly affect several neurobiological networks simultaneously. We studied the effect of the 5-HT2C receptor agonist WAY-163909 (0.3 and 3 mg/kg; i.p.) on the tissue concentration of dopamine (DA), 5-HT and noradrenaline (NA) in 29 rat brain regions related to motor, cognitive, mood and vegetative networks. We found that WAY-163909, without altering the tissue concentration of NA, increased 5-HT concentrations in the medial orbitofrontal cortex and the motor cortex M2 at 3 mg/kg and decreased it in the dorsolateral orbitofrontal cortex at 0.3 mg/kg. WAY-163909 enhanced DA concentrations in the central nucleus of the amygdala at 0.3 mg/kg and reduced it in the dorsal hypothalamus at 3 mg/kg. Using correlative analysis of the tissue content of monoamines, WAY-163909 dramatically changed the profile and the pattern of the correlations within and between monoaminergic systems without drastically changing the total number of these correlations. The profile of these changes in correlations was dose-dependent as it was very different between the two doses within and among monoaminergic systems. In conclusion, the data indicated that the 5-HT2C receptor agonist WAY-163909 quantitatively alters monoamine content in very few regions but promotes multiple changes of monoaminergic connectivity in the brain.",Glutathione peroxidase-1 overexpressing transgenic mice are protected from cocaine-induced drug dependence.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30685319,Neurochemistry international,2019 05 23,"Converging evidence has demonstrated that oxidative burdens are associated with drug dependence induced by psychostimulants. Here, we investigated whether oxidative stress directly mediates conditioned place preference and behavioral sensitization (drug dependence) induced by cocaine and whether glutathione peroxidase-1 (GPx-1), a major GPx, modulates cocaine-induced psychotoxic changes in mice. Cocaine-induced drug dependence was followed by increases in c-Fos-immunoreactivity (c-Fos-IR) in the nucleus accumbens. Simultaneously, cocaine significantly increased oxidative parameters and nuclear factor κB (NFκB) activity (i.e. nuclear translocation and DNA binding activity) in the striatum (including nucleus accumbens). Genetic depletion of GPx-1 made mice susceptible to drug dependence induced by cocaine in mice, while genetic overexpression of GPx-1 protected the mice from drug dependence. Pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC), a NFκB inhibitor, significantly attenuated the sensitivity induced by the genetic depletion of GPx-1 in mice. However, PDTC did not exhibit any additive effects against the protection afforded by the genetic overexpression of GPx-1. Our results suggest that drug dependence induced by cocaine requires oxidative stress and NFκB activation, and that the GPx-1 gene is a potential protective factor against cocaine-induced drug dependence through positive modulation of NFκB."

The inactivation was time and Cu(II) concentration dependent. The rate of inactivation showed non-linear dependence on Cu(II) concentration, indicating that a reversible complex with the enzyme (KD 84.5 ± 6.5 μM) was formed. The inhibitors S-nitrobenzyl-glutathione or S-methyl-glutathione competes with Cu(II), suggesting the specificity of the chemical modification reaction. SDS-PAGE analysis of the inactivated enzyme showed that the enzyme is fragmented and two new bands of 13 and 11 kDa are formed. This shows that ZmGSTF1-1 was specifically cleaved at a single site, by the locally generated free radicals, through a Fenton-type reaction. Sequencing of the fragments allowed the identification of the Cu(II) binding site on ZmGSTF1-1. The three-dimensional structure of ZmGSTF1-1 reveals that the Cu(II) binding site is localized within the glutathione-binding site (G-site) and His40 and Gln53 are most likely the residues that provide the coordination sites for the Cu(II) binding. These findings were confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis. This copper-induced oxidative cleavage reaction of ZmGSTF1-1 may function as a detoxification route for Cu(II) for protecting plant cells from copper-induced deleterious effects.",Synthesis and characterization of a low solubility edible film based on native cassava starch.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30685306,International journal of biological macromolecules,2019 03 13,"Films based on cassava starch have been widely used for fruit coating; however, it is necessary to incorporate other polymers in order to improve mechanical properties, once starch only leads to highly hydrophilic films, compromising their application.

The films were prepared by casting method and a statistical design of 23 was used to evaluate the effect of each polymer and what their combinations would influence over the final product. The formation of a physical blend was confirmed by FTIR. It showed low solubility, varying (10 ± 2) % a (23 ± 4) %, Opacity ranging from (1.06 ± 0.04) to (1.55 ± 0.13) AU x nm/mm, thickness from (0.20 ± 0.01) mm to (0.44 ± 0.03) mm and water vapor transmission rate ranging from 25 ± 0.2 to 30 ± 1.4 g s-1 m-2. Lower amounts of starch led to more flexible, less opaque and soluble films, while the combination of higher levels of starch and chitosan was responsible for lowering films water vapor transmission rate. Thus, the films showed interesting properties for fruit surface coating.",Dual thermo-and pH-sensitive injectable hydrogels of chitosan/(poly(N-isopropylacrylamide-co-itaconic acid)) for doxorubicin delivery in breast cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30685304,International journal of biological macromolecules,2019 03 13,"In this work, dual thermo- and pH-responsive hydrogels were developed and loaded with doxorubicin (DOX) with potential therapy of breast cancer. Hydrogels were engineered by blending synthesized poly(N-isopropylacrylamide-co-itaconic acid) (PNIAAm-co-IA) with chitosan (CS) through ionic crosslinking using glycerophosphate (GP). The synthesized copolymer and hydrogels were characterized by means of various techniques such as FT-IR, 1H NMR, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX). Lower critical solution temperature (LCST) of the copolymer was determined around 39 °C using UV-Vis spectroscopy. Swelling studies of hydrogels and their morphology implied the porous structure, high water content with rapid swelling/deswelling rate in response to abrupt changes of pH and temperature. The release investigation of DOX at different concentration, temperature and pH values confirmed the accelerated release of DOX in lower concentration and acidic condition at 37 °C as compared to neutral pH and the temperature of 40 °C. The MTT cytotoxicity study revealed that the hydrogels are cytocompatible and exert no/negligible cytotoxicity on MCF-7 cells. The proliferation of MCF-7 cells on the prepared hydrogel and DOX-loaded hydrogel was evaluated by 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining which further demonstrated the potential of developed hydrogels for local therapy of breast cancer.",MiR-515-5p acts as a tumor suppressor via targeting TRIP13 in prostate cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30685303,International journal of biological macromolecules,2019 04 03,"MiR-515-5p has been suggested to function as tumor suppressor in various human cancers. However, the role of miR-515-5p in prostate cancer was still unclear. In this study, we observed miR-515-5p expression was reduced in prostate cancer tissues and prostate cancer cell lines compared with paired adjacent normal prostatic tissues and normal human prostate epithelial cell lines, respectively. Furthermore, we found miR-515-5p was negatively correlated with TRIP13 mRNA and protein expression in prostate cancer tissue samples, and miR-515-5p directly targeted TRIP13 3'-UTR and negatively regulated TRIP13 mRNA and protein expression. Moreover, miR-515-5p acted as a tumor suppressor to regulate cell proliferation, migration and invasion via targeting TRIP13 in prostate cancer. Besides, we observed that miR-515-5p expression in prostate cancer patients with advanced T stage subgroup or high Gleason score was significantly lower than its expression in prostate cancer patients with early T stage or low Gleason score. Survival analysis suggested that prostate cancer cases with high miR-515-5p expression had better prognosis than prostate cancer cases with low miR-515-5p expression.

Resection of a large, bleeding lower lobe mass identified metastatic gestational choriocarcinoma, a previously unreported cause of spontaneous hemothorax and an equally rare consequence of placenta accreta. The identification of novel genomic features associated with gestational choriocarcinoma allowed for confirmation of this subtype, which has clinical implications for surveillance and prognosis following treatment with adjuvant therapy. Spontaneous hemothorax is an uncommon problem most often associated with pneumothorax, an underlying arterial-venous malformation, or an undiagnosed malignancy. The management of spontaneous hemothorax may include chest tube drainage, vessel embolization, operative evacuation, and in some cases the need for lung resection to obtain hemostasis. Although the finding of metastatic disease from a gynecological malignancy is not unusual, the presentation of spontaneous hemothorax as a result of a metastatic tumor rupture into the pleural space is a rare phenomenon.",Elective Aortic Root Replacement in North America: Analysis of STS Adult Cardiac Surgery Database.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30685254,The Annals of thoracic surgery,2019 04 23,"Unlike coronary artery bypass and aortic and mitral valve procedures, there is no predictive risk model for aortic root replacement procedures.

The close apposition between jSR and mitochondria creates high Ca2+ microdomains at the contact sites, increasing the efficiency of the excitation-contraction-bioenergetics coupling, where the Ca2+ transfer from SR to mitochondria plays a critical role. The SR-mitochondria contacts are established through protein tethers, with mitofusin 2 the most studied SR-mitochondrial ""bridge"", albeit controversial. Mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake is further optimized with the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter preferentially localized in the jSR-mitochondria contact sites and the mitochondrial Na+/Ca2+ exchanger localized away from these sites. Despite all these unique features facilitating the privileged transport of Ca2+ from SR to mitochondria in adult cardiomyocytes, the question remains whether mitochondrial Ca2+ concentrations oscillate in synchronicity with cytosolic Ca2+ transients during heartbeats. Proper Ca2+ transfer controls not only the process of mitochondrial bioenergetics, but also of mitochondria-mediated cell death, autophagy/mitophagy, mitochondrial fusion/fission dynamics, reactive oxygen species generation, and redox signaling, among others. Our review focuses specifically on Ca2+ signaling between SR and mitochondria in adult cardiomyocytes. We discuss the physiological and pathological implications of this SR-mitochondrial Ca2+ signaling, research gaps, and future trends.",Immunogenicity and safety of the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine compared to 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide in immunocompetent adults: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30685252,Vaccine,2019 02 04,"Despite the use of 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV23) in adults there is substantial morbidity and mortality in the elderly due to pneumococcal infections.

It is a mild surfactant not known to denature the viral proteins; this property makes TX-100 useful for maintaining antigen conformational structure, and, as an added benefit, for partially stabilizing vaccine formulations against protein aggregation. Despite its benefits, TX-100 needs to be filtered out after virus splitting has been achieved, due to its toxicity in large quantities. Accordingly, residual TX-100 presence in vaccine formulations has implications for both formulation stability and safety, necessitating both accurate screening during processing to guide decision-making about filtration repeats and accurate quantitation in the final product. Accurate HPLC-based methods are used successfully for the latter but their use for routine screening during processing is far from ideal because they often require extensive sample preparation and are fairly slow, complicated and costly. Here, ""deconstruction"" of UV-Vis absorption spectra into components corresponding to different absorbing ""species"" is demonstrated as a novel and viable method for routine TX-100 screening in vaccine samples from different industrial processing steps. This method is fairly accurate and, more importantly, preparation-free, rapid, simple/user-friendly and comparatively inexpensive. It is evaluated in depth in terms of applicability conditions, limitations and potential for high-throughput adaptation as well as generalization to other complex biopharmaceutical formulations.",Priorities in applied research to ensure programmatic success in the global elimination of canine rabies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30685249,Vaccine,2019 01 27,"The elimination of human rabies mediated by dogs is attainable in concept, based upon current sensitive and specific diagnostic methods, existing safe and effective human and veterinary vaccines and a sound virological, pathological and epidemiological understanding of the disease.

In the present study, (1) in line with the hypothesis of affective counter-regulation, we investigated whether positive versus negative tones can receive differential attentional enhancement, depending on motivational context (Experiment 1); and (2) whether the early facilitation of positive and negative tones can operate strictly outside of the focus of voluntary attention (Experiment 2). In Experiment 1, we replicated the basic N1 valence effect, but found no moderation by motivational context. In Experiment 2, we found a small valence effect on the N1. By combining data from the three experiments (i.e., our previous experiment and the present ones; N = 72), we found a clear enhancement of N1-amplitudes for valenced tones without moderation by experiment. This pattern of results suggests comparable early attentional enhancement of valenced tones in general: (a) despite different level of concurrent task-relevant attentional and motivational demands in these experiments; and (b) without prioritizing one valence category over another, supporting our claim that the general relevance of the tones with high motivational value that governs early attentional facilitation.",Personalizing neuromodulation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30685229,International journal of psychophysiology : official journal of the International Organization of Psychophysiology,2019 06 10,"In the era of ""big data"", we are gaining rich person-specific information about neuroanatomy, neural function, and cognitive functions.

With this approach, the pre-surgical orthodontic treatment can be eliminated, the maxilla and the mandible are surgically repositioned into the desired position, and the therapy is ended with a short orthodontic phase. Several studies have reported that the SFA is an acceptable approach, but postoperative stability is unclear. In this study, a systematic review on the SFA was performed. The PubMed, Google Scholar, Scopus, LexisNexis, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases were accessed. Studies from which data could be extracted on skeletal stability based on specific cephalometric points were included. The search yielded 2766 publications. Application of the selection criteria resulted in a final group of 14 articles. Five hundred and sixty patients with class III malocclusion underwent orthognathic surgery, 339 with the SFA. Study parameters such as evaluation time points and reference planes varied, making it impossible to perform a meta-analysis. The studies suggest that surgery with the SFA is as stable as surgery with the conventional approach. However, all articles described stability using a penultimate time point of 'after surgery' and not 'after debonding'; hence orthodontic movements and consequent mandibular movements could have influenced cephalometric measurements. Thus, to verify the real stability of the SFA, further research with longer follow-up periods is required, with evaluation at the same time points.",Pharyngeal airway space changes after maxillomandibular advancement: a five-year retrospective study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30685225,International journal of oral and maxillofacial surgery,2019 05 10,"The aim of this study was to compare the alterations in three regions of the airway-nasopharynx, oropharynx, and hypopharynx-in relation to the area of the midsagittal plane, volume, and minimal axial area after maxillomandibular advancement (MMA) surgery.

Therefore, this study was undertaken to determine if dapagliflozin can act as a promoter in a 2-stage bladder cancer model in rats induced with N-butyl-N-(4-hydroxybutyl)-nitrosamine (BBN). Rats given BBN (100 or 400 mg/kg, po) twice weekly for 6 weeks in Phase 1 were assigned in Phase 2 to receive daily dose of vehicle, dapagliflozin (0.5 mg/kg, po) or uracil (positive control, 3% in diet) from weeks 8-34. All bladders were evaluated by histopathology. Verifying the validity of the model, uracil increased the incidence of bladder cancer, while dapagliflozin had no effect on the incidence or invasiveness of transitional cell carcinoma. The exposure of dapagliflozin at 0.5 mg/kg/day in rats was 7 times the clinical exposure at maximal therapeutic dose (10 mg). In conclusion, dapagliflozin does not act as promoter or progressor of bladder cancer in a validated bladder cancer model in rats."

However, the mucociliary clearance poses a challenge in gaining high efficacy of intranasal drug delivery because cilia continuously carry the mucus blanket towards the laryngeal region. To better understand mucus flow behaviour on the human nasal cavity wall, we present computational model development, and evaluation of mucus motion on a realistic nasal cavity model reconstructed from CT-scans. The model development involved two approaches based on the actual nasal cavity geometry namely: (i) unwrapped-surface model in 2D domain and (ii) 3D-shell model. Conservation equations of fluid motion were applied to the domains, where a mucus production source term was used to initiate the mucus motion. The analysis included mucus flow patterns, virtual saccharin tests and quantitative velocity magnitude analysis, which demonstrated that the 3D-shell model results provided better agreement with experimental data. The unwrapped-surface model also suffered from mesh-deformations during the unwrapping stage and this led to higher mucus velocity compared to experimental data. Therefore, the 3D-shell model was recommended for future mucus flow simulations. As a first step towards mucus motion modelling this study provides important information that accurately simulates a mucus velocity field on a human nasal cavity wall, for assessment of toxicology and efficacy of intranasal drug delivery.",Exposure duration and absorbed dose assessment in pesticide-exposed agricultural workers: Implications for risk assessment and modeling.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30685193,International journal of hygiene and environmental health,2019 03 29,"Absorbed dose assessment from dermal exposure involves multiplying skin contamination by the dermal absorption coefficient, which is usually defined for the standard workday of 8 h.

Lignocellulosic biomass comprised of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin is an abundant, carbon neutral, and alternative resource for replacing fossil fuels in the future. Solvent liquefaction of lignocellulosic biomass is a promising route to obtain biofuels, bio-based materials, and chemicals using a range of solvents as reaction media under moderate reaction conditions. Recently, several researchers have considered novel approaches for enhancing the process efficiency and economics. This review article reports the state-of-the-art knowledge of lignocellulose liquefaction in the recent three years with the main focus on the feedstock, liquefaction technology, target products, and degradation mechanism of each biomass component.

Studies of thermophilic microorganisms have shown a considerable biotechnological potential due to their optimum growth and metabolisms at high temperatures (≥50 °C), which is supported by their thermostable enzymes. Microalgal and cyanobacterial communities present in high-temperature ecosystems account for a large part of the total ecosystem biomass and productivity, and can be exploited to generate several value-added products of agricultural, pharmaceutical, nutraceutical, and industrial relevance.

YAP1 interacts with SHP2 to promote translocation of SHP2 to nucleus, which consequently promotes Wnt target activation. However, the oncogenic role of the nuclear localization of SHP2 in human cancers remains unclear. We hypothesized that nuclear SHP2 localization, in combination with nuclear YAP1 expression, could be associated with poor overall survival (OS) and relapse free survival (RFS) due to an increase in cyclin D1 and c-Myc mRNA expression following activation of Wnt/ß-catenin signaling. Immunohistochemical analysis of SHP2 and YAP1 protein expression in 102 tumors resected from patients with NSCLC revealed that nuclear SHP2 expression was well correlated with nuclear YAP1 expression (P < 0.001). Evaluation of cyclin D1 and c-Myc mRNA levels by the real-time reverse-phase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) revealed that patients with high cyclin D1 and high c-Myc mRNA expressing tumors more commonly showed high nuclear YAP1 and high nuclear SHP2 (high/high) rather than the high/low, low/high, or low/low combinations (P < 0.001 for cyclin D1 and c-Myc). Kaplan-Meier and Cox-regression models showed OS and RFS to be poorer in patients in the high/high subgroup than in the low/low subgroup (OS: HR = 2.85, 95% CI, 1.52-5.35, P = 0.001; RFS: HR = 2.55, 95% CI, 1.37-4.72, P = 0.003). No prognostic significance was observed for the other two subgroups (low/high and high/low) when compared to the low/low subgroup in this study population. Therefore, we suggest that the prognostic value of SHP2 could reflect the nuclear localization of SHP2 and its interaction with nuclear YAP1, which led to subsequent upregulation of cyclin D1 and c-Myc mRNA expression via activation of the Wnt/ß-catenin signaling pathway.",The work of sterile processing departments: An exploratory study using qualitative interviews and a quantitative process database.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30685129,American journal of infection control,2019 05 08,"The sterile processing of surgical instruments and equipment is an essential part of surgical operations.

The expansion of a noncoding GGGGCC (G4C2) hexanucleotide repeat in the C9orf72 gene is a major cause of both familial FTLD and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of C9orf72 G4C2-repeat expansion in a Turkish population with FTLD and to determine its effects on the phenotype. The G4C2 expansion in the C9orf72 gene was analyzed in 100 cases of FTLD without mutations of the MAPT, PGRN, CHMP2B, VCP, TARDBP, and FUS genes and 100 age-matched healthy controls by using repeat-primed polymerase chain reaction and fragment length analysis techniques. A possible pathogenic repeat (≥30) was found in one of the familial cases (1/33), but none of the sporadic cases. The difference in the allele length between the cases and controls was statistically significant (p < 0.01). Intermediate (20-30) repeats were detected in 4% of our cases. Patients with psychotic symptoms appear to be enriched for intermediate and possibly pathogenic repeats. To determine whether the intermediate and ≥30-repeat allele carriers shared the C9orf72 risk haplotype, we examined rs4879515 and rs3849942 in all samples and family members of patients with possibly pathogenic alleles. We identified at least one risk allele for each single-nucleotide polymorphism in all intermediate and possibly pathogenic repeat carriers. We observed that ≥8 unit repeats were strongly correlated with the tagging risk alleles for both single-nucleotide polymorphisms (p < 0.001). To our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate C9orf72 G4C2 repeats in Turkish patients with FTLD. The present findings suggest that pathogenic expansions of the C9orf72 repeat are uncommon in Turkish patients with FTLD, but intermediate repeats may be a risk factor for FTLD and act as a genetic modifying factor for psychotic symptoms.",Plasma IFN-γ-inducible chemokines CXCL9 and CXCL10 correlate with survival and chemotherapeutic efficacy in advanced pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30685120,Pancreatology : official journal of the International Association of Pancreatology (IAP) ...

The traditional modifiable risk factors are able to explain the majority of CVD mortality. The aim of this review is to analyze gender-specific aspects of major conventional cardiovascular risk factors and to assess whether they have the same impact on CVD in women. Cigarette smoking remains the single largest preventable cause of cardiovascular morbidity and premature death worldwide. Women smoke less than men; however, smoking seems to be more harmful in women, particularly in oral contraceptive users. Obesity in the general population is more prevalent in women. Visceral adiposity is associated with insulin resistance and a higher risk of developing cardiovascular disease. Life expectancy in female diabetic patients is shorter than in men with diabetes; women with diabetes are also at higher risk of developing cardiovascular events. Changes of main lipid parameters in women are frequently associated with their hormonal status and/or hormonal treatment. Hypertension is highly prevalent in post-menopausal women and carries a higher risk of developing left ventricular hypertrophy, which, together with a greater increase in vascular and myocardial stiffness, results in a higher incidence of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction and a higher risk of developing stroke. The risk of abdominal aortic rupture is substantially higher in women. In conclusion, smoking, diabetes and hypertension seem to be more harmful in women.

We previously showed that treatment with the immunoproteasome inhibitor ONX 0914 prevented the expansion of plasma cells and prevented chronic allograft nephropathy and organ failure after kidney transplantation in rats, but the mechanism has remained elusive. In the current study, we confirmed a long-term reduction in alloantibody production and improvements in allograft histology in rats treated with ONX 0914 or with the broad-spectrum proteasome inhibitor bortezomib. Plasma cells from allotransplanted rats expressed immunoproteasomes at high levels. Immunoproteasome inhibition with ONX 0914 led to ubiquitin-conjugate accumulation, activation of the unfolded protein response, and induction of apoptosis in plasma cells. In addition, ONX 0914 suppressed the expression of adhesion molecules (VLA-4 and LFA-1), plasma cell survival factors (APRIL and IL-6), and IFN-γ-inducible chemokines in bone marrow, while the APRIL receptor BCMA, the IL-6 receptor, and the chemokine receptors CXCR4 and CXCR3 were down-regulated on plasma cells.

However, this detection is challenging, particularly without a persistent elevation of ST-segment reflected in an electrocardiogram or in blood tests. A majority of the available point-of-care testing devices allow accurate and rapid diagnosis of AMI. However, AMI diagnosis is reliable only at intermediate and later stages, with myocardial injury (> 6 h) and MI, based on the expression of specific cardiac biomarkers including troponin I or T (cTnI or cTnT), creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB), and myoglobin. Diagnosis at the early myocardial ischemia stage is not possible. To overcome this limitation, a sensitive and rapid microfluidic paper-based device (µPAD) was developed for the simultaneous detection of multiple cardiac biomarkers for the early and late diagnosis of AMI. The glycogen phosphorylase isoenzyme BB (GPBB) was detected during early (within first 4 h) ischemic myocardial injury. On the same µPAD platform, detection of prolonged elevation of levels of cTnT and CK-MB, which are only produced 6 h after the onset of chest pain in human serum, was possible. Sandwich immunoassay performed on the µPAD achieved reproducibility (RSD approximately 10% and intra-and inter-day precision (CV 10-20%, 99th percentile), as well as consistently stable test results for 28 days, with strong correlation (r2= 0.962), using the standard Siemens Centaur XPT Immunoassay system.

The 16S rRNA gene sequence was identical between the two isolates and showed 97 % similarity with respect to the closest related species Oenococcus oeni and O. kitaharae. Therefore, the two isolates were classified within the genus Oenococcus. The phylogeny based on the pheS gene sequences also confirmed the position of the new taxon. DNA-DNA hybridizations based on in silico genome-to-genome comparisons (GGDC) and Average Nucleotide Identity (ANI) values, as well as species-specific PCR, validated the novelty of the taxon. Various phenotypic characteristics such as the optimum temperature and pH for growth, the ability to metabolise sugars, the aptitude to perform the malolactic fermentation, and the resistance to ethanol and NaCl, revealed that the two strains are distinguishable from the other members of the Oenococcus genus. The combined genotypic and phenotypic data support the classification of strains UCMA15228T and UCMA17102 into a novel species of Oenococcus, for which the name O. sicerae sp. nov. is proposed.

Approximately 20% of primary prostate tumors are invisible to mpMRI, and we hypothesize that this invisibility reflects fundamental molecular properties of the tumor. We therefore profiled the genomes and transcriptomes of 40 International Society of Urological Pathology grade 2 tumors: 20 mpMRI-invisible (Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System [PI-RADS] v2 <3) and 20 mpMRI-visible (PI-RADS v2 5) tumors. mpMRI-visible tumors were enriched in hallmarks of nimbosus, an aggressive pathological, molecular, and microenvironmental phenomenon in prostate cancer. These hallmarks included genomes with increased mutation density, a higher prevalence of intraductal carcinoma/cribriform architecture pathology, and altered abundance of 102 transcripts, including overexpression of noncoding RNAs such as SCHLAP1. Multiple small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) were identified, and a snoRNA signature synergized with nimbosus hallmarks to discriminate visible from invisible tumors. These data suggest a confluence of aggressive molecular and microenvironmental phenomena underlie mpMRI visibility of localized prostate cancer. PATIENT SUMMARY: We examined the correlation between tumor biology and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) visibility in a group of patients with low- intermediate-risk prostate cancer.

The correlation between increased shear wave speed and increased fibrosis in the liver has been established as a useful diagnostic tool. In comparison, the precise mechanisms of shear wave attenuation, and its relation to diseased states of the liver, are less well-established. This study focused on the hypothesis that steatosis adds a viscous (lossy) component to the liver, which increases shear wave attenuation. Twenty patients' livers were scanned with ultrasound and with induced shear wave propagation, and the resulting displacement profiles were analyzed using recently developed estimators to derive both the speed and attenuation of the shear waves within 6-cm2 regions of interest. The results were compared with pathology scores obtained from liver biopsies taken under ultrasound guidance. Across these cases, increases in shear wave attenuation were linked to increased steatosis score. This preliminary study supports the hypothesis and indicates the possible utility of the measurements for non-invasive and quantitative assessment of steatosis.",Attenuation Coefficient Estimation of Normal Placentas.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30685076,Ultrasound in medicine & biology,2019 05 13,"Attenuation coefficient estimation has the potential to be a useful tool for placental tissue characterization. A current challenge is the presence of inhomogeneities in biological tissue that result in a large variance in the attenuation coefficient estimate (ACE), restricting its clinical utility. In this work, we propose a new Attenuation Estimation Region Of Interest (AEROI) selection method for computing the ACE based on the (i) envelope signal-to-noise ratio deviation and (ii) coefficient of variation of the transmit pulse bandwidth. The method was first validated on a tissue-mimicking phantom, for which an 18%-21% reduction in the standard deviation of ACE and a 14%-24% reduction in the ACE error, expressed as a percentage of reported ACE, were obtained. A study on 59 post-delivery clinically normal placentas was then performed. The proposed AEROI selection method reduced the intra-subject standard deviation of ACE from 0.72 to 0.39 dB/cm/MHz. The measured ACE of 59 placentas was 0.77 ± 0.37 dB/cm/MHz, which establishes a baseline for future studies on placental tissue characterization.",Benzodiazepines vs barbiturates for alcohol withdrawal: Analysis of 3 different treatment protocols.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30685075,The American journal of emergency medicine,2019 03 26,"Alcohol withdrawal treatment varies widely.

Patients in the United States national Get With The Guidelines-Stroke registry with a TIA were included. Admission systolic and diastolic BP was used to compute mean arterial pressure and pulse pressure (PP). A subset of this cohort was linked to Centers for Medicare and Medicaid claims data for postdischarge outcomes. The in-hospital outcomes of interest were: mortality, not discharged home, and inability to ambulate independently at discharge. Postdischarge, 30-day and 90-day outcomes of interest were mortality, readmission for stroke, and readmission for major cardiovascular event-composite of death, cerebrovascular, or cardiovascular readmission. Among the 218,803 patients with TIA, lower admission systolic blood pressure (SBP) was associated with worse in-hospital outcomes. Compared with patients with SBP of 150 mm Hg, a lower SBP of 120 mm Hg was associated with higher risk of in-hospital death (adjusted OR = 1.79; 95% CI = 1.50 to 2.12), not being discharged home (adjusted OR = 1.31; 95% CI = 1.27 to 1.36), or inability to ambulate independently at discharge (adjusted OR = 1.27; 95% CI = 1.23 to 1.31).

To measure these properties, experimental probes of various types have been developed, but how each probe reflects the properties of heterogeneous cell regions has remained obscure. To better understand differences attributable to the probe technology, as well as to define the relative sensitivity of each probe to different cellular structures, here we took a comprehensive approach. We studied two cell types-Schlemm's canal endothelial cells and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs)-using four different probe technologies: 1) atomic force microscopy (AFM) with sharp tip, 2) AFM with round tip, 3) optical magnetic twisting cytometry (OMTC), and 4) traction microscopy (TM). Perturbation of Schlemm's canal cells with dexamethasone treatment, α-actinin overexpression, or RhoA overexpression caused increases in traction reported by TM and stiffness reported by sharp-tip AFM as compared to corresponding controls. By contrast, under these same experimental conditions, stiffness reported by round-tip AFM and by OMTC indicated little change. Knockout (KO) of vimentin in MEFs caused a diminution of traction reported by TM, as well as stiffness reported by sharp-tip and round-tip AFM. However, stiffness reported by OMTC in vimentin-KO MEFs was greater than in wild type. Finite-element analysis demonstrated that this paradoxical OMTC result in vimentin-KO MEFs could be attributed to reduced cell thickness. Our results also suggest that vimentin contributes not only to intracellular network stiffness but also cortex stiffness. Taken together, this evidence suggests that AFM sharp tip and TM emphasize properties of the actin-rich shell of the cell, whereas round-tip AFM and OMTC emphasize those of the noncortical intracellular network.",Pressure-Temperature Analysis of the Stability of the CTL9 Domain Reveals Hidden Intermediates.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30685054,Biophysical journal,2019 02 22,"The observation of two-state unfolding for many small single-domain proteins by denaturants has led to speculation that protein sequences may have evolved to limit the population of partially folded states that could be detrimental to fitness. How such strong cooperativity arises from a multitude of individual interactions is not well understood. Here, we investigate the stability and folding cooperativity of the C-terminal domain of the ribosomal protein L9 in the pressure-temperature plane using site-specific NMR. In contrast to apparent cooperative unfolding detected with denaturant-induced and thermal-induced unfolding experiments and stopped-flow refolding studies at ambient pressure, NMR-detected pressure unfolding revealed significant deviation from two-state behavior, with a core region that was selectively destabilized by increasing temperature. Comparison of pressure-dependent NMR signals from both the folded and unfolded states revealed the population of at least one invisible excited state at atmospheric pressure. The core destabilizing cavity-creating I98A mutation apparently increased the cooperativity of the loss of folded-state peak intensity while also increasing the population of this invisible excited state present at atmospheric pressure. These observations highlight how local stability is subtly modulated by sequence to tune protein conformational landscapes and illustrate the ability of pressure- and temperature-dependent studies to reveal otherwise hidden states.",Outcomes of rural trauma patients who undergo damage control laparotomy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30685052,American journal of surgery,2019 01 27,The majority of motor vehicle crashes occur in a rural setting and those patients have double the mortality of their urban counterparts.

However, due to differences in epitopes recognition between IgG and IgE, an epitope modification during food processing can potentially alter allergenicity and detection in such different way. For that reason, the use of traditional immunological methods to anticipate or study the protein allergenicity is not recommended. The objective of this work was to develop a standardized competitive ELISA, based on recombinant IgE antibodies to β-lactoglobulin (β-lg), to reveal and to measure changes in β-lg immunoreactivity provoked by technological processes in foods containing this milk protein. As a result, a sensitive immunochemical method (Limit of Detection, LOD < 0.2 μg mL-1) has been developed for β-lg recognition. Also, this technique has been confirmed to detect modifications in β-lg-IgE binding after food processing (thermal treatment) in a similar way to those results obtained with allergic patients in previous works.

Here, we developed an advanced cell-SELEX strategy featuring functionalized graphene oxide (GO) and isothermal rolling circle amplification (RCA) to select aptamers against a prevailing foodborne pathogen, Vibrio parahaemolyticus. Polyethyleneglycol (PEG) and chitosan (CTS) were grafted onto the sheet-like GO molecules to synthesize a PC-GO material. TEM and FT-IR characterization demonstrated that the PC-GO composites were near-nanometric scale and tethered with PEG and CTS moieties, a property that significantly improved its solubility in biological buffer solutions used in cell-SELEX process. PC-GO could bind with ssDNAs with lower affinities to target cells, therefore the selection efficiency is greatly enhanced. The cell-binding aptamer candidates (CACs) were amplified by 107 fold using complementary ring mediated (CRM-RCA), a created amplification method that generate single-stranded products, which could be directly used in the next round selection. As fueled by PC-GO and CRM-RCA, four highly specific aptamers with lowest Kd value of 10.3 ± 2.5 nM were obtained. Flow cytometry analysis showed that all the four aptamers exhibited more than 75% binding affinity to V. parahaemolyticus than to other foodborne bacteria (less than 18%).

Importantly, probe PAPE-HA with preeminent specificity and ultrasensitivity was proven to possess powerful capability of tracking native HOCl in live cells and zebrafish, and we thus anticipate that probe PAPE-HA could be used as a novel promising tool for revealing diverse cellular functions of HOCl.",A ratiometric fluorescent probe for lysosomal hypochlorous acid based on through-bond energy transfer strategy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30685030,Analytica chimica acta,2019 03 22,"In this paper, we synthesized a ratiometric fluorescence probe (IRh-Ly) for lysosomal hypochlorous acid (HOCl) by adopting a through-bond energy transfer (TBET) strategy on rhodamine-imidazo[1,5-a]pyridine platform. IRh-Ly showed brilliant selectivity, rapid response for HOCl. The probe also exhibited high sensitivity with the detection limit calculated to be 10.2 nM. Moreover, we demonstrated its successful application of detecting lysosomal HOCl in living RAW264.7 cells. Notably, the morpholine was integrated into the fluorescent probe IRh-Ly and the results revealed that IRh-Ly could target lysosome and detect the lysosomal HOCl. All the unique features made IRh-Ly particularly suitable for ratiometric HOCl detection and bio-imaging applications.",A novel microfluidic resistive pulse sensor with multiple voltage input channels and a side sensing gate for particle and cell detection.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30685029,Analytica chimica acta,2019 03 22,"Traditionally, a resistive pulse sensor (also known as Coulter counter) works by letting a particle pass through a small orifice in an electrolyte solution. The detection sensitivity mainly relies on the volume ratio of the particle to the orifice. This paper presents a novel resistive pulse sensor which has a sensing orifice located on the side wall of a microchannel. In this way, the sensor can detect and count particles (or cells) without requiring particles (or cells) passing through the sensing gate. An equation was derived to relate the magnitudes of the detected signals and the electrical resistances. Results show that the magnitudes of the detected signals can be increased by applying voltages from more than one voltage input channels simultaneously. Under the same conditions, the magnitudes of the detected signals become larger when the diameters of particles are larger. Higher detection sensitivity can be obtained simply by increasing either the magnitudes of the applied voltages or the number of the voltage input channels, or reducing the opening of the side sensing gate to a size that is even smaller than the diameter of the particle. Due to the high detection sensitivity, detection of 1 μm particles by a relatively large sensing gate of 5 × 10 × 10 μm (width × length × height) was successfully demonstrated with a signal to noise ratio (S/N) of approximately 3. This sensor was also applied to detect and count human red blood cells and lymphocyte cells. Results show that this method can clearly distinguish the cells with different sizes based on the pre-determined-thresholds. Because this sensor does not require cells to pass through the sensing gate, the channel clogging problem can be avoided. More importantly, the detection sensitivity can be tuned by applying different voltages without fabricating a smaller sensing gate.",A smartphone-assisted microfluidic chemistry analyzer using image-based colorimetric assays for multi-index monitoring of diabetes and hyperlipidemia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30685028,Analytica chimica acta,2019 03 22,"A smartphone-assisted microfluidic chemistry analyzer using an image-based colorimetric detection method was successfully developed for the simultaneous analysis of three diabetes- and hyperlipidemia-related indexes, glucose (GLU), triglyceride (TG), and total cholesterol (TC). A fan-shaped microfluidic chip was designed and optimized to reliably allocate a premixed serum sample into four reaction chambers by a simple pipetting. The color changes of the peroxidase-H2O2 enzymatic reactions in the chambers were captured and analyzed using a smartphone-controlled analyzer with a LED light source and a CCD camera. The highly quantitative relationships between the analyte concentrations and the color characteristic values of the green channel of the captured images were successfully established, enabling accurate and reproducible detections of GLU, TG, and TC simultaneously at a low cost. The parallel analyses of 111 serum samples using our system and a conventional chemistry analyzer were conducted, yielding an excellent correlation and consistency between these two systems.

In this context, the unique advantages of pulsed amperometric detection (PAD) in terms of high sensitivity and selectivity, and electrode cleaning through the application of pulsed potential for noble metal electrodes (e.g. Au, Pt), have established PAD as an important detection technique for a variety of electrochemically active compounds. PAD is especially valuable for analytes not detectable by ultraviolet (UV) photometric detection, such as organic aliphatic compounds and carbohydrates, especially when used with miniaturised capillary and chip-based separation methods. These applications have been accomplished through advances in PAD potential waveform design, as well as through the incorporation of nanomaterials (NMs) employed as microelectrodes in PAD. PAD allows on-line pulsed potential cleaning and coupling with capillary or standard separation techniques. The NMs are largely employed in microelectrodes to speed up mass and electron transfer between electrode surfaces and to perform as reactants in EC analysis. These advances in PAD have improved the sensitive and selective EC detection of analytes, especially in biological samples with complex sample matrices, and detection of electro-inactive compounds such as aliphatic organic compounds (i.e., formic acid, acetic acid, maleic acids, and β-cyclodextrin complexes). This review addresses the fundamentals of PAD, the role of pulsed sequences in AD, the utilisation of different EC detectors for PAD, technological advancements in PAD waveforms, utilisation of microelectrodes in PAD techniques, advances in the use of NMs in PAD, the applications of PAD, and prospects for EC detection, with emphasis on PAD in flow-based systems."

Continuous training, especially of young neurosurgeons, is crucial for understanding complex neuroanatomy. In this study, we used a neuronavigation system with 3D volumetric image rendering to determine the anatomical relationship between the sagittal suture and the superior sagittal sinus (SSS) in patients with intracranial lesions. Furthermore, we discussed the applicability of such system in preoperative planning, residency training, and research. The study included 30 adult patients (18 female/12 male) who underwent a cranial computed tomography (CT) scan combined with venous angiography, for preoperative planning. The position of the sagittal suture in relation to the SSS was assessed in 3D CT images using an image guidance system (IGS) with 3D volumetric image rendering. Measurements were performed along the course of the sagittal sinus at the bregma, lambda, and in the middle between these two points. The SSS deviated to the right side of the sagittal suture in 50% of cases at the bregma, and in 46.7% at the midpoint and lambda. The SSS was displaced to the left of the sagittal suture in 10% of cases at the bregma and lambda and in 13% at the midpoint. IGSs with 3D volumetric image rendering enable simultaneous visualization of bony surfaces, soft tissue and vascular structures and interactive modulation of tissue transparency. They can be used in preoperative planning and intraoperative guidance to validate external landmarks and to determine anatomical relationships. In addition, 3D IGSs can be utilized for training of surgical residents and for research in anatomy.",Anatomical changes with needle length are correlated with leaf structural and physiological traits across five Pinus species.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30684950,"Plant, cell & environment",2019 04 12,"The genus Pinus has wide geographical range and includes species that are the most economically valued among forest trees worldwide. Pine needle length varies greatly among species, but the effects of needle length on anatomy, function, and coordination and trade-offs among traits are poorly understood. We examined variation in leaf morphological, anatomical, mechanical, chemical, and physiological characteristics among five southern pine species: Pinus echinata, Pinus elliottii, Pinus palustris, Pinus taeda, and Pinus virginiana. We found that increasing needle length contributed to a trade-off between the relative fractions of support versus photosynthetic tissue (mesophyll) across species. From the shortest (7 cm) to the longest (36 cm) needles, mechanical tissue fraction increased by 50%, whereas needle dry density decreased by 21%, revealing multiple adjustments to a greater need for mechanical support in longer needles. We also found a fourfold increase in leaf hydraulic conductance over the range of needle length across species, associated with weaker upward trends in stomatal conductance and photosynthetic capacity. Our results suggest that the leaf size strongly influences their anatomical traits, which, in turn, are reflected in leaf mechanical support and physiological capacity.",Rupture risk of small unruptured cerebral aneurysms.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30684948,Journal of neurosurgery,2019 01 26,"OBJECTIVEThe annual rupture rate of small (3-4 mm) unruptured cerebral aneurysms (UCAs) is 0.36% per year, however, the proportion of small ruptured aneurysms < 5 mm is 35%. This discrepancy is explained by the hypothesis that most acute subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is from recently formed, unscreened aneurysms, but this hypothesis is without definitive proof. The authors aimed to clarify the actual number of screened, ruptured small aneurysms and risk factors for rupture.METHODSThe Unruptured Cerebral Aneurysm Study Japan, a project of the Japan Neurosurgical Society, was designed to clarify the natural course of UCAs. From January 2001 through March 2004, 6697 UCAs among 5720 patients were prospectively registered. At registration, 2839 patients (49.6%) had 3132 (46.8%) small UCAs of 3-4 mm. The registered, treated, and rupture numbers of these small aneurysms and the annual rupture rate were investigated. The rate was assessed per aneurysm. The characteristics of patients and aneurysms were compared to those of larger unruptured aneurysms (≥ 5 mm). Cumulative rates of SAH were estimated per aneurysm. Risk factors underwent univariate and multivariate analysis.RESULTSTreatment and rupture numbers of small UCAs were 1132 (37.1% of all treated aneurysms) and 23 (20.7% of all ruptured aneurysms), respectively. The registered, treated, rupture number, and annual rupture rates were 1658 (24.8%), 495 (16.2%), 11 (9.9%), and 0.30%, respectively, among 3-mm aneurysms, and 1474 (22.0%), 637 (20.9%), 12 (10.8%), and 0.45%, respectively, among 4-mm aneurysms. Multivariate risk-factor analysis revealed that a screening brain checkup (hazard ratio [HR] 4.1, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2-14.4), history of SAH (HR 10.8, 95% CI 2.3-51.1), uncontrolled hypertension (HR 5.2, 95% CI 1.8-15.3), and location on the anterior communicating artery (ACoA; HR 5.0, 95% CI 1.6-15.5) were independent predictors of rupture.CONCLUSIONSAlthough the annual rupture rate of small aneurysms was low, the actual number of ruptures was not low. Small aneurysms that ruptured during follow-up could be detected, screened, and managed based on each risk factor. Possible selection criteria for treating small UCAs include a history of SAH, uncontrolled hypertension, location on the ACoA, and young patients.

This study aimed to elucidate the incidence, risk factors, and impact on outcome of SHCs in a large cohort of SAH patients.METHODSAll consecutive patients with ruptured aneurysms treated between January 2003 and June 2016 were eligible for this study. Patients' charts were reviewed for clinical data, and imaging studies were reviewed for radiographic data. SHCs were divided into those associated with ventriculostomy and those not associated with ventriculostomy, as well as into major and minor bleeding forms, depending on clinical impact.RESULTSSixty-two (6.6%) of the 939 patients included in the final analysis developed SHCs. Ventriculostomy-associated bleedings (n = 16) were independently predicted by mono- or dual-antiplatelet therapy after aneurysm treatment (p = 0.028, adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 10.28; and p = 0.026, aOR = 14.25, respectively) but showed no impact on functional outcome after SAH. Periinterventional use of thrombolytic agents for early effective anticoagulation was the only independent predictor (p = 0.010, aOR = 4.27) of major SHCs (n = 38, 61.3%) in endovascularly treated patients. In turn, a major SHC was independently associated with poor outcome at the 6-month follow-up (modified Rankin Scale score > 3). Blood thinning drug therapy prior to SAH was not associated with SHC risk.CONCLUSIONSSHCs present a rare sequela of SAH. Antiplatelet therapy during (but not before) SAH increases the risk of ventriculostomy-associated bleedings, but without further impact on the course and outcome of SAH. The use of thrombolytic agents for early effective anticoagulation carries relevant risk for major SHCs and poor outcome.",Repeat magnetic resonance imaging-guided focused ultrasound thalamotomy for recurrent essential tremor: case report and review of MRI findings.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30684946,Journal of neurosurgery,2019 01 26,"An 86-year-old right-handed man with medically refractory essential tremor was treated using left-sided MRI-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) thalamotomy targeting the dentatorubrothalamic tract (DRTT) at its intersection with the ventral intermediate nucleus of the thalamus, with immediate symptomatic improvement and immediate postprocedure imaging demonstrating disruption of the DRTT. The patient experienced a partial return of symptoms 9 weeks following the procedure, and MRI demonstrated retraction of the left thalamic ablation site. The patient underwent repeat left-sided MRgFUS thalamotomy 4 months after initial treatment, resulting in reduced tremor. MR thermometry temperature measurements during the second MRgFUS procedure were unreliable with large fluctuations and false readings, likely due to susceptibility effects from the initial MRgFUS procedure. Final sonications were therefore monitored using the amount of energy delivered. The patient fared well after the second procedure and had sustained improvement in tremor control at the 12-month follow-up. This is the first report to describe the technical challenges of repeat MRgFUS with serial imaging.",Predictors of neoangiogenesis after indirect revascularization in moyamoya disease: a multicenter retrospective study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30684945,Journal of neurosurgery,2019 01 26,"OBJECTIVEThe effect of indirect revascularization to improve cerebral perfusion for moyamoya disease (MMD) is based on ingrowth of new vessels into the cortical brain. Preoperative indicators for neoangiogenesis would be helpful to the selection of appropriate procedures for MMD patients but have not yet been investigated. Our study aimed to identify potential predictors for neovascularization after indirect bypass surgery.METHODSThe authors reviewed consecutive cases with complete clinical and radiological documentation of patients who had undergone surgery between December 2010 and January 2018. Patients who were treated with indirect bypass surgery were included. Cerebrovascular characteristics were evaluated by catheter angiography. Neoangiogenesis after indirect bypass was determined as ""good"" or ""poor"" based on the Matsushima standard. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify predictors for neoangiogenesis after indirect bypass. Subgroup analyses by onset type and surgical type were carried out to identify specific predictors for different populations.RESULTSIn total, 231 hemispheres of 209 patients (mean ± SD age 23.06 ± 15.09 years, range 3-61 years) were retrospectively included. In 146 (63.2%) hemispheres, good neoangiogenesis was observed after indirect revascularization. Multivariate analysis showed that the status of ICA moyamoya vessels (p < 0.001, OR [95% CI] 3.242 [2.007-5.236]) is a predictor of favorable neoangiogenesis after indirect bypass surgery, whereas hemorrhagic onset (p < 0.001, OR [95% CI] 0.138 [0.054-0.353]) is a risk factor for poor neoangiogenesis. In addition, younger age was significantly associated with good neovascularization in patients with hemorrhagic onset (p = 0.027, OR [95% CI] 0.893 [0.808-0.987]), whereas age was not a significant predictor for neovascularization in non-hemorrhagic-onset patients (p = 0.955). Hemispheres with good revascularization had lower incidence of rebleeding, lower modified Rankin Scale scores, and more improvement of symptoms during long-term follow-up (p = 0.026, 0.006, and 0.013, respectively).CONCLUSIONSHemorrhagic onset predicts poor neovascularization after indirect bypass surgery for MMD patients. Abundant ICA moyamoya vessels indicate good neoangiogenesis after indirect bypass and vice versa, whereas absent ICA moyamoya vessels predict poor revascularization. Good neovascularization was associated with better long-term outcome. Future studies are needed to further address this issue and clarify the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms."

The authors sought to assess the effects of a novel ERAS protocol on clinical outcomes for patients undergoing elective spine or peripheral nerve surgery.METHODSThe authors conducted a prospective cohort analysis comparing clinical outcomes of patients undergoing elective spine or peripheral nerve surgery after implementation of the ERAS protocol compared to a historical control cohort in a tertiary care academic medical center. Patients in the historical cohort (September-December 2016) underwent traditional surgical care. Patients in the intervention group (April-June 2017) were enrolled in a unique ERAS protocol created by the Department of Neurosurgery at the University of Pennsylvania. Primary objectives were as follows: opioid and nonopioid pain medication consumption, need for opioid use at 1 month postoperatively, and patient-reported pain scores. Secondary objectives were as follows: mobilization and ambulation status, Foley catheter use, need for straight catheterization, length of stay, need for ICU admission, discharge status, and readmission within 30 days.RESULTSA total of 201 patients underwent surgical care via an ERAS protocol and were compared to a total of 74 patients undergoing traditional perioperative care (control group). The 2 groups were similar in baseline demographics. Intravenous opioid medications postoperatively via patient-controlled analgesia was nearly eliminated in the ERAS group (0.5% vs 54.1%, p < 0.001). This change was not associated with an increase in the average or daily pain scores in the ERAS group. At 1 month following surgery, a smaller proportion of patients in the ERAS group were using opioids (38.8% vs 52.7%, p = 0.041). The ERAS group demonstrated greater mobilization on postoperative day 0 (53.4% vs 17.1%, p < 0.001) and postoperative day 1 (84.1% vs 45.7%, p < 0.001) compared to the control group. Postoperative Foley use was decreased in the ERAS group (20.4% vs 47.3%, p < 0.001) without an increase in the rate of straight catheterization (8.1% vs 11.9%, p = 0.51).CONCLUSIONSImplementation of this novel ERAS pathway safely reduces patients' postoperative opioid requirements during hospitalization and 1 month postoperatively. ERAS results in improved postoperative mobilization and ambulation.",Complications for minimally invasive lateral interbody arthrodesis: a systematic review and meta-analysis comparing prepsoas and transpsoas approaches.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30684932,Journal of neurosurgery. Spine,2019 01 26,"OBJECTIVEMinimally invasive anterolateral retroperitoneal approaches for lumbar interbody arthrodesis have distinct advantages attractive to spine surgeons. Prepsoas or transpsoas trajectories can be employed with differing complication profiles because of the inherent anatomical differences encountered in each approach. The evidence comparing them remains limited because of poor quality data. Here, the authors sought to systematically review the available literature and perform a meta-analysis comparing the two techniques.METHODSA systematic review and meta-analysis was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. A database search was used to identify eligible studies. Prepsoas and transpsoas studies were compiled, and each study was assessed for inclusion criteria. Complication rates were recorded and compared between approach groups. Studies incorporating an analysis of postoperative subsidence and pseudarthrosis rates were also assessed and compared.RESULTSFor the prepsoas studies, 20 studies for the complications analysis and 8 studies for the pseudarthrosis outcomes analysis were included. For the transpsoas studies, 39 studies for the complications analysis and 19 studies for the pseudarthrosis outcomes analysis were included. For the complications analysis, 1874 patients treated via the prepsoas approach and 4607 treated with the transpsoas approach were included. In the transpsoas group, there was a higher rate of transient sensory symptoms (21.7% vs 8.7%, p = 0.002), transient hip flexor weakness (19.7% vs 5.7%, p < 0.001), and permanent neurological weakness (2.8% vs 1.0%, p = 0.005). A higher rate of sympathetic nerve injury was seen in the prepsoas group (5.4% vs 0.0%, p = 0.03). Of the nonneurological complications, major vascular injury was significantly higher in the prepsoas approach (1.8% vs 0.4%, p = 0.01). There was no difference in urological or peritoneal/bowel injury, postoperative ileus, or hematomas (all p > 0.05). A higher infection rate was noted for the transpsoas group (3.1% vs 1.1%, p = 0.01). With regard to postoperative fusion outcomes, similar rates of subsidence (12.2% prepsoas vs 13.8% transpsoas, p = 0.78) and pseudarthrosis (9.9% vs 7.5%, respectively, p = 0.57) were seen between the groups at the last follow-up.CONCLUSIONSComplication rates vary for the prepsoas and transpsoas approaches owing to the variable retroperitoneal anatomy encountered during surgical dissection. While the risks of a lasting motor deficit and transient sensory disturbances are higher for the transpsoas approach, there is a reciprocal reduction in the risks of major vascular injury and sympathetic nerve injury. These results can facilitate informed decision-making and tailored surgical planning regarding the choice of minimally invasive anterolateral access to the spine.",,,,2019 01 26,,HPLC-MS/MS analysis of ilimaquinone and its application in a pharmacokinetic study in rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30684930,Journal of pharmaceutical and biomedical analysis,2019 06 13,"Ilimaquinone, a metabolite isolated from the marine sponge Hippiospongia metachromia, has antimicrobial, cytotoxic, anti-HIV, anti-inflammatory, and anti-cancer activities.

The first configuration (phase A) consisted of an anoxic-aerobic photobioreactor operating at a hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 2d at different concentrations of total organic carbon (TOC) (90mgL-1-200mgL-1). In the second configuration (phase B) an anaerobic step was introduced before the anoxic tank to set a photosynthetic A2O process. In this phase, the HRT varied between 3 and 4d and the TOC was kept constant at 200mgL-1. In addition, the impact of external aeration in the aerobic photobioreactor was assessed. The maximum removals for ibuprofen, naproxen, salicylic acid, triclosan and propylparaben (94±1%, 52±43%, 98±2%, 100±0%, 100±0%, respectively) were recorded during phase B. In phase A, low TOC concentrations triggered higher ibuprofen and naproxen removals likely due to the high contribution of biological oxidation on their removal. In phase B, total or very high removal efficiencies were observed for ibuprofen, propylparaben and triclosan independently on the operating conditions. In contrast, the removal efficiency of naproxen and salicylic acid decreased when the HRT dropped from 4 to 3d in the absence of external aeration, which suggests that biodegradation played a key role in their removal. In addition, sorption might have contributed to the elimination of triclosan and propylparaben from the wastewater.",Organic pollutants in marine plastic debris from Canary Islands beaches.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30684899,The Science of the total environment,2019 03 01,"Given their capacity to adsorb chemical pollutants, microplastics represent a growing environmental concern in the oceans. The levels of 81 chemical compounds in two types of beached microplastic (pellets and fragments) were monitored across the Canary Islands (Spain). The highest concentrations were found for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) (52.1-17,023.6ng/g and 35.1-8725.8ng/g for pooled pellets and fragments, respectively). The polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) concentrations were 0.9-2285.8 and 1.6-772.5ng/g for pooled pellets and fragments, respectively, whereas organochlorine pesticides (OCP) ranged from 0.4-13,488.7 and 0.4-3778.8ng/g, respectively. The sum of polychlorinated biphenyls and diphenyl-dichloro-ethane (DDT) metabolites was significantly higher in beaches on Gran Canaria, which is the most populated and industrialized island. The sum of ultraviolet filters (UV-filters) was higher in those beaches more frequented by tourists (Famara and Las Canteras), than in occasionally or very rarely visited beaches (Cuervitos and Lambra), with values ranging from 0 to 37,740.3ng/g and 3.7-2169.3ng/g for pellets and fragments, respectively. Furthermore, the sum of brominated diphenyl ethers (BDE) (0-180.58ng/g for pooled pellets and 0.06-3923.9ng/g for pooled fragments) and organophosphorus flame retardants (OPFR) (20.0-378.0ng/g for pooled pellets, and 22.6-7013.9ng/g for pooled fragments) was significantly higher in an urban beach (Las Canteras) than in the rest of the studied beaches. Finally, the concentrations of the pesticide chlorpyrifos were much higher on Gran Canaria beaches than in the rest. In this research we provide further evidence of the important role of plastic debris in the adsorption of a wide range of marine pollutants. The regional pattern of chemical contamination of plastics reveals that the sorption of many compounds probably occurs in coastal waters. Further investigation is necessary to understand the relationship between plastic types and adsorption of different pollutants, especially for emerging pollutants.",Dynamics of microbial community in the bioreactor for bisphenol S removal.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30684898,The Science of the total environment,2019 03 19,"Bisphenol S is one of the alternative substitutes of Bisphenol A, a chemical widely recognized as an endocrine disrupting compound. In the past few years, a variety of studies on degradation of BPA demonstrated that microorganisms play important roles in the degradation process. However, the fate of BPS during wastewater treatment processes and the composition of microorganisms that functionalize BPS degradation remain to be explored. In this study, three bioreactors, R-BPS (amended with Bisphenol S), R-BPSHA (amended with Bisphenol S and humic acid) and Con (control bioreactor), were set up to investigate the fate of BPS and the microbial compositions and dynamics in the bioreactors, especially for the microorganisms associated with BPS removal. Results showed that a complete removal was achieved within 24 days. The addition of humic acid accelerated the elimination of BPS in both effluent and sludge. The results of 16S rRNA gene ampilicon sequencing revealed that the most abundant bacteria in all samples were affiliated to Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Acidobacteria and Chloroflexi. Seven major genera were likely associated with BPS removal, including Pseudomonas, Azospira, Hydrogenophaga, Devosia, Delftia, Acidovorax and Rhodobacter. Among them, humic acid increased relative abundance of some bacteria, such as Pseudomonas, Hydrogenophaga and Acidovorax. These findings would give valuable information on the microbial community composition associated with BPS removal, providing biological background for bioremediation of BPS-contaminated environment.",Seeking social support and postpartum depression: A pilot retrospective study of perceived changes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30684897,Midwifery,2019 05 08,"Postpartum depression prevalence rates reach as high as 25% (Gavin, 2006).

With supporting evidence from neuroimaging studies, the abnormal functional connectivity (FC) of the hippocampus has been associated with various mood disorders, including BD and MDD. However, the features of the hippocampal FC underlying MDD and BD have not been directly compared. This study aims to investigate the hippocampal resting-state FC (rsFC) analyses to distinguish these two clinical conditions. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data was collected from a sample group of 30 patients with BD, 29 patients with MDD and 30 healthy controls (HCs). One-way ANOVA was employed to assess the potential differences of the hippocampus FC across all subjects. BD patients exhibited increased FC of the bilateral anterior/posterior hippocampus with lingual gyrus and inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) relative to patients MDD patients. In comparison with HCs, patients with BD and MDD had an increased FC between the right anterior hippocampus and lingual gyrus and a decreased FC between the right posterior hippocampus and right IFG. The results revealed a distinct hippocampal FC in MDD patients compared with that observed in BD patients. These findings may assist investigators in attempting to distinguish mood disorders by using fMRI data.","Posttraumatic stress disorder, social anxiety disorder and childhood trauma: Differences in hippocampal subfield volume.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30684895,Psychiatry research.

The sample comprised 26 participants SAD with early childhood trauma, 22 participants with SAD without early childhood trauma, 17 with PTSD secondary to early childhood trauma and 25 control participants. We used Freesurfer version 6 to determine hippocampal subfield volumes. Findings included significant reduction in right parasubiculum volume between the PTSD group secondary to early childhood trauma and the SAD group without early childhood trauma, as well as a significant reduction in left HATA (Hippocampal Amygdala Transition Area) volume between PTSD with early childhood trauma compared to controls, as well as compared to SAD with early childhood trauma. These findings did withstand correction for multiple resting using the false discovery rate. Our findings of an association of reduced volumes in the parasubiculum and HATA regions with PTSD secondary to childhood trauma are interesting. Further work should investigate whether parasubiculum and HATA regional volume reductions in PTSD are a specific effect of early childhood trauma or a specific manifestation of PTSD pathology. Further work should also be undertaken to determine if hippocampal subfield atrophy is associated with SAD in the setting of early childhood maltreatment.",hsa-miR-20a-5p attenuates allergic inflammation in HMC-1 cells by targeting HDAC4.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30684894,Molecular immunology,2019 05 06,"micro-RNAs (miRNAs) are non-coding RNAs which play important role in human diseases.

After 21 days exposure to 0, 0.75, 1.5 and 3 ppm indoxacarb, expression of IL-1β, IL-8, IL-10, TNF-α, IFN-γ, SOD, CAT, HSP70, IGF-I and IGF-II were assessed in liver, kidney and gills. In general, exposure to low concentration of indoxacarb increased inflammatory cytokine gene expression (IL-1β, IL-8, IL-10, TNF-α and IFN-γ) and inhibits inflammatory cytokines' expression at higher concentrations. The assessment of antioxidant gene expression (SOD and CAT) in different organs indicate that they were increased by low concentrations of indoxacarb to deal with primary oxidative situation. However, higher concentrations of indoxacarb caused reduction in oxidative gene expression. IGF genes expression in liver significantly increased at a concentration of 0.75 ppm treatment, then it decreased at 1.5 ppm indoxacarb and increased again by increasing in the indoxacarb concentration to 3 ppm. The expression of HSP70 in kidney showed a significant elevation in 0.75 and 1.5 ppm treatments compared with 3 ppm treatment and the control group. The expression of this gene in liver was significantly increased in 1.5 and 3 ppm treatments. The same pattern of expression was also observed in gill. Overall, indoxacarb exposure affects common carp health at transcription levels.

Part A, Molecular and biomolecular spectroscopy",2019 03 21,"White striping (WS), an emerging muscle myopathy in poultry industry, is gaining increasing attention globally. In this study, visible and near-infrared hyperspectral imaging (HSI, 400-1000 nm) was investigated for developing an optical sensing technique to differentiate WS broiler breast fillets (pectoralis major) from normal fillets. The minimum noise fraction (MNF), followed by an inverse MNF (IMNF), was conducted to improve the signal-to-noise ratio of hyperspectral images during the pre-processing process. Three regions of interest (ROIs) were selected at cranial, middle and caudal locations within each fillet image. Spectral principal component analysis (PCA) revealed that PC2 and PC3 were effective for the differentiation and key wavelengths (450, 492, 541, 581, 629, 869 and 980 nm) were selected from the corresponding PC loadings. Spatial texture features on corresponding score images were obtained using gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) and grayscale histogram statistics (GHS), respectively. Partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) models were evaluated with various inputs including spectral (full and key wavelengths), textural and fused features. GLCM features improved performance of multispectral imaging with the highest correct classification rate (CCR) of 91.7%, AUC value (0.917), and Kappa coefficient (0.833) for prediction set. Considering the complexity and heterogeneity of meat samples at different locations, the optimal sampling location was also analyzed and results provided the evidence that the cranial location worked most effectively for the differentiation between normal and WS samples. Overall, results confirmed the great potential of HSI in range of 400-1000 nm in differentiation between normal and WS chicken breast meat.",Effects of variable selection and processing of NIR and ATR-IR spectra on the prediction of extractive content in Eucalyptus bosistoana heartwood.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30684879,"Spectrochimica acta.

The interaction between EryB, Pd2+and malathion in the system was investigated by fluorescence, RRS and UV-Vis spectroscopy. Under the optimum conditions, the RRS intensity of EryB, Pd2+ and malathion was weak when exist in alone or any two kinds, however, the RRS intensity of the EryB-Pd2+-Mala system had an obvious enhancement due to Pd2+ could interact with the hydrolysis products of Mala and EryB each other form a new complexes. At the same time, the fluorescence intensity of EryB was decreased significantly in the presence of Pd2+, and the fluorescence intensity of EryB-Pd2+ system further decreased when Mala added, interestingly. So it was further proved that there was a forming complex in EryB-Pd2+-Mala system. Under the optimal conditions, the RRS enhanced intensity of the system was linearly proportional to the Mala's concentration in the range of 0.012-0.8 μg/mL, and the LOD was 1.7 ng/mL, with the correlation coefficient was R2 = 0.9960. So, a new method for determination of Mala was established and this method has been demonstrated in real sample with satisfactory results.",Questions surrounding the optimal time for surgical treatment of pelvic organ prolapse.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30684877,"European journal of obstetrics, gynecology, and reproductive biology",2019 06 05,The purpose of study is to evaluate the recurrence rate of pelvic organ prolapse after surgical treatment and pre- to postoperative changes in sexual function of patients with different stages of pelvic organ prolapse.,Do we need post-pregnancy screening with human chorionic gonadotrophin after previous hydatidiform mole to identify patients with recurrent gestational trophoblastic disease?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30684876,"European journal of obstetrics, gynecology, and reproductive biology",2019 06 05,To determine whether post-pregnancy human chorionic gonadotrophin screening after previous hydatidiform mole identifies patients with recurrent gestational trophoblastic disease.,Different types of suppression-burst patterns in patients with epilepsy of infancy with migrating focal seizures (EIMFS).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30684875,Seizure,2019 03 15,"In rare cases, patients with epilepsy of infancy withmigrating focal seizures (EIMFS) exhibit suppression-burst (SB) patterns on electroencephalography (EEG), similar to the findings observed in patients with Ohtahara syndrome and early myoclonic encephalopathy.

We examine the political party/mortality relationship in the United States context. The goal of this paper is two-fold: first, we seek to replicate the mortality difference between Republicans and Democrats in two samples, controlling for demographic confounders. Second, we attempt to isolate and test two potential contributors to the relationship between political party affiliation and mortality: (1) socioeconomic status and (2) dispositional traits reflecting a personal responsibility ethos, as described by the Republican party. Graduate and sibling cohorts from the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study were used to estimate mortality risk from 2004 to 2014. In separate Cox proportional hazards models controlling for age and sex, we adjusted first for markers of socioeconomic status (such as wealth and education), then for dispositional traits (such as conscientiousness and active coping), and finally for both socioeconomic status and dispositional traits together. Clogg's method was used to test the statistical significance of attenuation in hazard ratios for each model. In both cohorts, Republicans exhibited lower mortality risk compared to Democrats (Hazard Ratios = 0.79 and 0.73 in graduate and sibling cohorts, respectively [p < 0.05]). This relationship was explained, in part, by socioeconomic status and traits reflecting personal responsibility. Together, socioeconomic factors and dispositional traits account for about 52% (graduates) and 44% (siblings) of Republicans' survival advantage. This study suggests that mortality differences between political parties in the US may be linked to structural and individual determinants of health. These findings highlight the need for better understanding of political party divides in mortality rates.",mtDNA Chromatin-like Organization Is Gradually Established during Mammalian Embryogenesis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30684873,iScience,2019 02 28,"Unlike the nuclear genome, the mammalian mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) is thought to be coated solely by mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM), whose binding sequence preferences are debated. Therefore, higher-order mtDNA organization is considered much less regulated than both the bacterial nucleoid and the nuclear chromatin. However, our recently identified conserved DNase footprinting pattern in human mtDNA, which co-localizes with regulatory elements and responds to physiological conditions, likely reflects a structured higher-order mtDNA organization. We hypothesized that this pattern emerges during embryogenesis. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed assay for transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing (ATAC-seq) results collected during the course of mouse and human early embryogenesis. Our results reveal, for the first time, a gradual and dynamic emergence of the adult mtDNA footprinting pattern during embryogenesis of both mammals. Taken together, our findings suggest that the structured adult chromatin-like mtDNA organization is gradually formed during mammalian embryogenesis.",Proteomic analysis of adult Galeruca daurica (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) at different stages during summer diapause.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30684872,"Comparative biochemistry and physiology. Part D, Genomics & proteomics",2019 05 06,"Galeruca daurica is a new pest causing great losses in the Inner Mongolian grasslands of China. The adults enter obligatory diapause during summer. However, the molecular mechanism of summer diapause remains unknown. We used iTRAQ to conduct proteomic analysis of adult G. daurica at the pre-diapause (PD), diapause (D) and post-diapause (TD) stages during summer diapause. A total of 139 and 118 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were detected in D/PD and TD/D comparisons, respectively. Besides a large number of DEPs involved in metabolic process, stress response, cytoskeletal reorganization, and phagosome pathway, many new proteins related to diapause were found in this study, such as encapsulation-relating proteins, odorant binding proteins, chemosensory proteins and ribosomal proteins. KEGG analysis revealed that the phagosome pathway was the only common significantly enriched pathway in both D/PD and TD/D. In addition, juvenile hormone regulation and Ca2+ signaling may play an important role in the regulation of summer diapause in G. daurica. Our proteomic analysis provides a new insight into the mechanism of obligatory summer diapause, and lays a foundation for future molecular level studies.",A novel cereblon modulator for targeted protein degradation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30684871,European journal of medicinal chemistry,2019 03 05,"Immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs) exert anti-myeloma activity by binding to the protein cereblon (CRBN) and subsequently degrading IKZF1/3. Recently, their ability to recruit E3 ubiquitin ligase has been used in the proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC) technology. Herein, we design and synthesize a novel IMiD analog TD-106 that induces the degradation of IKZF1/3 and inhibits the proliferation of multiple myeloma cells in vitro as well as in vivo. Moreover, we demonstrate that TD-428, which comprises TD-106 linked to a BET inhibitor, JQ1 efficiently induce BET protein degradation in the prostate cancer cell line 22Rv1. Consequently, cell proliferation is inhibited due to suppressed C-MYC transcription. These results, therefore, firmly suggest that the newly synthesized IMiD analog, TD-106, is a novel CRBN modulator that can be used for targeted protein degradation."

Cross-docking studies with many common interfering proteins provided five of the highly selective inhibitor for BAV. Analyses of the leading molecules with ADME-Tox filtering tool and atomistic molecular dynamics simulation studies finally discovered a benzoxazolone derivative as one of the most promising molecules towards the highly selective inhibition of BAV. The theoretical calculations are also supported by the experimental evidences where the interactions between the hit ligand and a model peptide sequence, mimicking the VP9 protein of BAV, were studied. Overall the development of a personalized therapeutic towards the highly selective inhibition of BAV is discussed herein for the first time in literature.",Plasmonic biosensors for bacterial endotoxin detection on biomimetic C-18 supported fiber optic probes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30684858,Biosensors & bioelectronics,2019 02 09,"Bacterial endotoxins such as lipopolysaccharides (LPS) are major contaminants of most pharmaceutical and consumer products. We report an antibiotic-mediated plasmonic biosensor for LPS detection based on a facile U-bent fiber optic probe (UFOP) technology. Biomimetic self-assembled layer of octadecyltrichlorosilanes (OTS) were functionalized on the surface of optical fiber probes to hydrophobically entrap LPS from aqueous solutions. The binding of LPS molecules was monitored in real-time by measuring the change in refractive index (RI) in the evanescent layer. To add specificity and signal amplification, the bound LPS molecules were further tagged with antimicrobial polymyxin-B conjugated gold nanoparticles (PMB-AuNPs) in a sandwich format. The assay was extensively optimized by investigating the role of experimental parameters like OTS concentration, incubation time and addition of a silver reduction step at the end of the assay. The lower limit of detection (LOD) for LPS was found to be 0.4 ng/mL with a 36-fold improved sensitivity upon silver enhancement. The total assay time was 1 h. The assay was also found to be highly specific in the presence of common biopharmaceutical components and could thus serve as an efficient endotoxin detection platform for quality control testing during therapeutic development.",Electrochemiluminescence energy resonance transfer in 2D/2D heterostructured g-C3N4/MnO2 for glutathione detection.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30684857,Biosensors & bioelectronics,2019 02 09,"The energy transfer efficiency, strongly depending on the distance of donor-acceptor pair, is always a crucial factor for the construction of elegant electrochemiluminescence resonance energy transfer (ECL-RET)-based biosensors. In this paper, a novel and efficient ECL-RET in 2D/2D heterostructured g-C3N4/MnO2 was developed using g-C3N4 nanosheets (g-C3N4 NSs) as energy donor and MnO2 nanosheets (MnO2 NSs) as energy acceptor. In this system, MnO2 NSs in-situ grew on g-C3N4 NSs to form the 2D/2D heterostructure, greatly shortening the distance of the donor-acceptor pair (g-C3N4-MnO2) and thus greatly enhancing the RET efficiency. To demonstrate the performance of the system, a signal ""off-on"" ECL sensor was designed for glutathione (GSH) analysis. In the absence of GSH, MnO2 significantly quenched the ECL intensity of g-C3N4 owing to ECL-RET in this 2D/2D g-C3N4/MnO2 heterostructure (ECL signal ""off""). Upon the addition of GSH, MnO2 was reduced to Mn2+ by GSH and g-C3N4 was released from the heterostructured g-C3N4/MnO2, generating a recovery of ECL intensity (ECL signal ""on""). Under the optimal conditions, the designed ECL-RET signal ""off-on"" sensor realized the sensitive detection of GSH ranged from 0.2-100 μM with the detection limit of 0.05 μM. Furthermore, the as-prepared ECL-RET sensor exhibits good performance in the determination of GSH in human serum samples. The ECL-RET in 2D/2D heterostructure provides an ingenious way for the exploitation of novel ECL biosensing systems.",2D-porphrinic covalent organic framework-based aptasensor with enhanced photoelectrochemical response for the detection of C-reactive protein.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30684856,Biosensors & bioelectronics,2019 02 09,"In this study, a novel photoelectrochemical (PEC) aptasensor based on two-dimensional (2D) porphyrinic covalent organic frameworks (p-COFs) for the label-free detection of C-reactive protein (CRP) is presented. The obtained p-COFs possess high conductivity and an improved stability due to strong and rigid covalent linkages. The introduction of p-COFs hinder the recombination of electrons and holes, decreasing their band gap (Eg), thereby which improved the photocurrent conversion efficiency. Compared with pure porphyrin, p-COFs exhibited enhanced photocurrent intensity. An amplified photocurrent conversion efficiency and enhanced photocurrent results from H2O2, which act as active molecules and electron donors. As an unprecedented application of COFs in PEC bioanalysis, the detection of CRP with a PEC aptasensor is presented. The assembly of a CRP aptamer on the surface of Ag nanoparticles hinders the electron transfer, resulting in the decrease of the photocurrent response. This PEC aptasensor exhibits good analytical performances such as a rapid response, high stability, wide linear range and excellent selectivity, making COFs promising candidates for PEC bioanalysis.",Identification of anti-prion drugs and targets using toxicity-based assays.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30684854,Current opinion in pharmacology,2019 06 14,"Prion diseases are untreatable and invariably fatal, making the discovery of effective therapeutic interventions a priority. Most candidate molecules have been discovered based on their ability to reduce the levels of PrPSc, the infectious form of the prion protein, in cultured neuroblastoma cells. We have employed an alternative assay, based on an abnormal cellular phenotype associated with a mutant prion protein, to discover a novel class of anti-prion compounds, the phenethyl piperidines. Using an assay that monitors the acute toxic effects of PrPSc on the synapses of cultured hippocampal neurons, we have identified p38 MAPK as a druggable pharmacological target that is already being pursued for the treatment of other human diseases. Organotypic brain slices, which can propagate prions and mimic several neuropathological features of the disease, have also been used to test inhibitory compounds. An effective anti-prion regimen will involve synergistic combination of drugs acting at multiple steps of the pathogenic process, resulting not only in reduction in prion levels but also suppression of neurotoxic signaling.","Legal mobilization in medicine: Nurses, rape kits, and the emergence of forensic nursing in the United States since the 1970s.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30684853,Social science & medicine (1982),2019 02 15,"Routine administration of the sexual assault medical forensic exam (commonly known as the ""rape kit"") is one of the most significant healthcare reforms advanced by the U.S. anti-rape movement since the 1970s. To promote reform, nurses acted as practitioner-activists in emergency medicine and created the new specialty of forensic nursing to administer the medical forensic exam independent of physicians. Their efforts suggest a new way of conceptualizing the interface of law and medicine: the proactive invocation of criminal law in clinical medicine for the purpose of institutional reform in healthcare organizations, or what I term legal mobilization in medicine. Using the framework of legal mobilization in medicine, I ask: (1) how did nurses mobilize criminal law and rights to health in emergency medicine to facilitate reform? and (2) what were the effects on clinical practice and knowledge production? To chart this history, I draw on a review of published writings by early forensic nurses, interviews with leaders in the field, and ethnographic observation at the 20th anniversary International Association of Forensic Nurses conference in 2012, commemorating the founders and origins of this new specialty. Bringing together scholarship on law and social movements in socio-legal studies and scholarship on health and social movements in science, technology, and medicine studies, I argue that nurses forged a porous boundary between the overlapping institutional spheres of medicine and law in order to align the objectives of medical care and criminal investigation and, thereby, seek rights to healthcare and rights to justice for patient-victims through the enactment of new medical routines. I demonstrate the historical emergence of a novel, hybrid form of professional jurisdiction and medical practice, and I explore its benefits as well as its unintended consequences. I conclude by discussing the ethical implications of this case for the use of medical evidence to corroborate rape.",Dietary habits and adherence to dietary recommendations in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes compared with the general population in Denmark.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30684852,"Nutrition (Burbank, Los Angeles County, Calif.)",2019 03 18,The aim of the present study was to examine dietary habits and adherence to dietary recommendations in adult patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) compared with the general population in Denmark.,Association of pulse wave velocity with body fat measures at 30 y of age.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30684850,"Nutrition (Burbank, Los Angeles County, Calif.)",2019 03 18,"Pulse wave velocity (PWV) is an early marker of arterial stiffness and a strong predictor of cardiovascular disease (CVD).

Three BCFAs, 4-methyloctanoic (MOA), 4-ethyloctanoic (EOA) and 4-methylnonanoic (MNA) acids, have been implicated as the main compounds responsible for 'mutton flavour'. Animal age can also contribute to increasing BCFA concentration. Heptadecanoic acid (C17:0 FA) also increases with animal age in sheep. Using published data, a linear association has been found to exist between C17:0 FA with MOA and MNA in sheep fat, with C17:0 FA increasing proportionally with these two compounds. No association was found between C17:0 FA and EOA. As C17:0 FA is present in sheep fat in relatively higher proportions compared to BCFAs, it has potential to be used as a proxy for MOA and MOA as well as 'mutton flavour'."
