Our major purpose in the present study was to explore the occurrence and composition of prostatic calculi, and investigate the effect of calcium oxalate (CaOx) on clusterin expression and lower urinary tract symptom (LUTS) in prostatitis and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) patients with calculi. MATERIAL AND METHODS From December 2016 to January 2017, a total of 79 prostatitis patients aged more than 50 years were enrolled. The patients were divided into 3 groups: group A had small calculi (discrete, small echoes); group B had large calculi (large masses of multiple echoes, much coarser), and group C had no calculi. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed to evaluate the tissue scores. The clusterin expression was detected by quantitative real-time CR (qRT-PCR), Western blot, and immunofluorescence. RESULTS According to multifactor analysis, age was significantly associated with prostatic calculus. The composition of prostatic calculus was an independent factor of LUTS. The clusterin expression was elevated in group B. The mRNA and protein levels of clusterin in prostatitis and BPH patients with stones were obviously higher than those in prostatitis and BPH patients without stones. CaOx enhanced clusterin expression in a dose-dependent manner. CONCLUSIONS Large prostatic calculi were associated with LUST. Furthermore, CaOx enhanced clusterin expression, leading to large prostatic calculi. These results may provide a therapeutic strategy for prostatitis and BPH.",Clinical activity of abiraterone plus prednisone in docetaxel-naοve and docetaxel-resistant Chinese patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30560837,Asian journal of andrology,2019 04 10,"This study investigated the clinical activity of abiraterone plus prednisone in docetaxel-naïve and docetaxel-resistant Chinese patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). A total of 146 patients with docetaxel-naïve group (103 cases) and docetaxel-resistant group (43 cases) were enrolled from the Shanghai Cancer Center (Shanghai, China) in this retrospective cohort study. The efficacy endpoints were prostate-specific antigen response rate, prostate-specific antigen progression-free survival, clinical/radiographic progression-free survival, and overall survival in response to abiraterone plus prednisone. Significantly higher prostate-specific antigen response rate was found in docetaxel-naïve group (54.4%, 56/103) compared to docetaxel-resistant group (34.9%, 15/43) (P = 0.047). In addition, significantly higher median prostate-specific antigen progression-free survival (14.0 vs 7.7 months, P = 0.005), clinical or radiographic progression-free survival (17.0 vs 12.5 months, P = 0.003), and overall survival (27.0 vs 18.0 months, P = 0.016) were found in docetaxel-naïve group compared to docetaxel-resistant group, respectively. The univariate and multivariate analyses indicated that lower albumin and visceral metastases were independent significant predictors for shorter overall survival. To sum up, our data suggested that abiraterone plus prednisone was efficient in both docetaxel-naïve and docetaxel-resistant Chinese patients. Moreover, higher PSA response rate and longer overall survival were observed in the docetaxel-naïve group, which suggested that abiraterone was more effective for docetaxel- naïve patients than for docetaxel failures.",Recurrent oral squamous papilloma in a pediatric patient: Case report and review of the literature.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30560835,Nigerian journal of clinical practice,2019 01 18,"Squamous papillomas are common lesions of the oral mucosa.

In hospitals, control efforts would benefit from accurate estimation of asymptomatic colonization and infection importation rates from the community. However, developing such estimates remains challenging due to limited observation of colonization and complicated transmission dynamics within hospitals and the community. Here, we develop an inference framework that can estimate these key quantities by combining statistical filtering techniques, an agent-based model, and real-world patient-to-patient contact networks, and use this framework to infer nosocomial transmission and infection importation over an outbreak spanning 6 years in 66 Swedish hospitals.

Here we investigate the activity of human AMP LL37 against Escherichia coli by integrating quantitative, population and single-cell level experiments with theoretical modeling. We observe an unexpected, rapid absorption and retention of a large number of LL37 peptides by E. coli cells upon the inhibition of their growth, which increases population survivability. This transition occurs more likely in the late stage of cell division cycles. Cultures with high cell density exhibit two distinct subpopulations: a non-growing population that absorb peptides and a growing population that survive owing to the sequestration of the AMPs by others. A mathematical model based on this binary picture reproduces the rather surprising observations, including the increase of the minimum inhibitory concentration with cell density (even in dilute cultures) and the extensive lag in growth introduced by sub-lethal dosages of LL37 peptides.",Reciprocal regulation among TRPV1 channels and phosphoinositide 3-kinase in response to nerve growth factor.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30560783,eLife,2019 06 10,"Although it has been known for over a decade that the inflammatory mediator NGF sensitizes pain-receptor neurons through increased trafficking of TRPV1 channels to the plasma membrane, the mechanism by which this occurs remains mysterious. NGF activates phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), the enzyme that generates PI(3,4)P2 and PIP3, and PI3K activity is required for sensitization. One tantalizing hint came from the finding that the N-terminal region of TRPV1 interacts directly with PI3K. Using two-color total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy, we show that TRPV1 potentiates NGF-induced PI3K activity. A soluble TRPV1 fragment corresponding to the N-terminal Ankyrin repeats domain (ARD) was sufficient to produce this potentiation, indicating that allosteric regulation was involved. Further, other TRPV channels with conserved ARDs also potentiated NGF-induced PI3K activity. Our data demonstrate a novel reciprocal regulation of PI3K signaling by the ARD of TRPV channels.",Odor-evoked category reactivation in human ventromedial prefrontal cortex during sleep promotes memory consolidation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30560782,eLife,2019 03 18,"Slow-wave sleep is an optimal opportunity for memory consolidation: when encoding occurs in the presence of a sensory cue, delivery of that cue during sleep enhances retrieval of associated memories. Recent studies suggest that cues might promote consolidation by inducing neural reinstatement of cue-associated content during sleep, but direct evidence for such mechanisms is scant, and the relevant brain areas supporting these processes are poorly understood. Here, we address these gaps by combining a novel olfactory cueing paradigm with an object-location memory task and simultaneous EEG-fMRI recording in human subjects. Using pattern analysis of fMRI ensemble activity, we find that presentation of odor cues during sleep promotes reactivation of category-level information in ventromedial prefrontal cortex that significantly correlates with post-sleep memory performance. In identifying the potential mechanisms by which odor cues selectively modulate memory in the sleeping brain, these findings bring unique insights into elucidating how and what we remember.",The distribution of antibiotic use and its association with antibiotic resistance.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30560781,eLife,2019 05 22,"Antibiotic use is a primary driver of antibiotic resistance.

Here, we tested the hypothesis that repeated use of antibiotics has a stronger association with population-wide antibiotic resistance than broadly-distributed, low-intensity use. First, we characterized the distribution of outpatient antibiotic use across US states, finding that antibiotic use is uneven and that repeated use of antibiotics makes up a minority of antibiotic use. Second, we compared antibiotic use with resistance for 72 pathogen-antibiotic combinations across states. Finally, having partitioned total use into extensive and intensive margins, we found that intense use had a weaker association with resistance than extensive use. If the use-resistance relationship is causal, these results suggest that reducing total use and selection intensity will require reducing broadly distributed, low-intensity use."

Prior studies in rural villages of Peru have observed clusters of T. solium cysticercosis among pigs that live near human tapeworm carriers. Such spatial analyses, however, have been limited by incomplete participation and substandard diagnostic tests. In this study, we evaluated the association between necropsy-confirmed cysticercosis in pigs and their distance to T. solium tapeworm carriers in six villages in northern Peru. A total of six (1.4%) tapeworm carriers were detected using copro-antigen enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and seven of 10 (70%) pigs belonging to the tapeworm carriers were found with viable cyst infection on necropsy. This was significantly greater than the prevalence of viable cyst infection among pigs living < 500 m (11%) and > 500 m (0.5%) from a tapeworm carrier (P < 0.001 for distance trend). Similar statistically significant prevalence gradients were observed after adjustment for possible confounders and for other pig-level outcomes including infection with > 10 viable cysts, degenerated cyst infection, and serological outcomes. This investigation confirms that porcine cysticercosis clusters strongly around tapeworm carriers in endemic rural regions of northern Peru and supports interventions that target these hotspots.","Identification Key for the Chagas Disease Vectors of Five Brazilian States, Based on Cytogenetic Data.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30560768,The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene,2019 02 14,"Chagas disease is a public health problem caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi that affects about 8 million people worldwide.

This method allows the differential expressivity of polygenic scores predictive of both educational attainment and IQ (EA3) on the phenotype of IQ to be directly operationalized throughout the full range of these variables. Utilizing a parental SES factor-weighted composite as a measure of childhood SES, evidence for the Scarr-Rowe effect was found, that is, the genetic expressivity of EA3 on IQ increased with increasing parental SES (β = 0.08, p = 4.71×10-10, df = 6,255). The effect was found for both the male and female samples separately, β(males) = 0.08, p = 5.27×10-5, df = 3,018; β(females) = 0.08, p = 1.93×10-6, df = 3,236. The effects were furthermore robust to removing outlying values of parental SES and to log-transforming the SES variable. The results are similar to those produced using a more conventional two-way interaction model, with IQ predicting the EA3 × log of parental SES interaction after the main effects; however, CPEM allows for greater model degrees of freedom, thus is better powered to detect the effect when it is small in magnitude (CPEM β = 0.05, p = 6.69×10-5 vs. two-way interaction β = 0.02, pone-tailed = .045, in both models log parental SES is used).",Beneficial effects of maternal swimming during pregnancy on offspring metabolism when the father is obese.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30560765,Journal of developmental origins of health and disease,2018 12 18,"We aimed to evaluate the impact of maternal exercise training on the offspring metabolism and body size caused by father obesity.

Children participated in an object and picture naming task in which they produced words selected to test different phonological properties. The bilinguals' first languages were coded in terms of the frequency and complexity of these phonological properties. Results indicated that bilinguals who spoke languages characterized by high frequency/complexity of codas and clusters had superior results in their coda and cluster accuracy in comparison to monolinguals. Bilinguals also had better coda and cluster accuracy scores than monolinguals. These findings provide evidence for cross-linguistic interaction in combination with a 'general bilingual effect'.

For this study, 11 primiparous German Holstein cows were available from which hair samples at weeks 6 and 8 of lactation were analysed. The average body weight of these animals was 558 ± 27 kg at calving and milk yield at 100-days in milk was 3,537 ± 529 kg. Feed intake and milk yield were measured daily. Body weight and back fat thickness were measured at calving and in weeks 2, 4, and 8 of lactation. Energy balance and energy utilisation were calculated until week 6 of lactation. Spearman's correlation coefficients were found to be significantly positive for the relationship between the percentage of C12:0 and C14:0 fatty acids in the hair in lactation week 8 and energy intake in weeks 5 and 6 (0.62 &lt; r &lt; 0.65, P &lt; 0.05). If the animals are grouped according to their energy utilisation between weeks 1 and 6 into two groups higher (n = 6) or lower (n = 5) than the median, animals of the high energy utilising group had a higher energy intake. These animals had also higher percentages of the C12:0 fatty acid in their hair fat (week 6: 4.9% vs. 3.1%, P &lt; 0.05; week 8: 4.3% vs. 2.9%, P = 0.05). Our hypothesis is supported, and this study justifies further investigation of the content of medium-chain fatty acids in hair samples as biomarkers for the metabolic status of a cow during early lactation.","Metaphor processing in middle childhood and at the transition to early adolescence: the role of chronological age, mental age, and verbal intelligence.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30560743,Journal of child language,2018 12 18,"Metaphor development in conjunction with verbal intelligence and linguistic competence in middle childhood and at the transition to early adolescence was investigated. 298 individuals between seven and ten years (chronological age) who attended grades two-four (mental age) were tested for metaphor processing by the Metaphoric Triads Task, for linguistic competence (HELD), and verbal intelligence (WISC-III). Chronological age significantly predicted metaphor processing with a breakpoint of 8.2 years regarding identification and comprehension, and 10.2 years regarding preference. Fourth-graders showed highest metaphor processing scores. Verbal intelligence significantly predicted metaphor processing; this effect became stronger with increasing age. Attributional metaphors were best understood and most preferred. Chronological and mental age are associated with metaphor processing in an age span that is seemingly crucial for metaphor development. Verbal analogical reasoning, concept formation, verbal abstraction, and semantic knowledge predicted metaphor comprehension.

Online solutions in this field can be deployed quickly and at very low cost, especially if they are not dependent on bespoke devices or offline processes such as the provision and analysis of biological samples. One key challenge is the automated delivery of personalised dietary advice in a replicable, scalable and inexpensive way, using valid nutrition assessment methods and effective recommendations. We have developed a web-based personalised nutrition system (eNutri) which assesses dietary intake using a validated graphical FFQ and provides personalised food-based dietary advice automatically. Its effectiveness was evaluated during an online randomised controlled trial dietary intervention (EatWellUK study) in which personalised dietary advice was compared with general population recommendations (control) delivered online. The present paper presents a review of literature relevant to this work, and describes the strategies used during the development of the eNutri app. Its design and source code have been made publicly available under a permissive open source license, so that other researchers and organisations can benefit from this work. In a context where personalised diet advice has great potential for health promotion and disease prevention at-scale and yet is not currently being offered in the most popular mobile apps, the strategies and approaches described in the present paper can help to inform and advance the design and development of technologies for personalised nutrition."

The AEG-1 (Astrocyte Elevated Gene 1) gene displays oncogenic characteristics, including proliferation, metastasis, chemoresistance, invasion, and evasion of apoptosis, and is strongly linked to the occurrence of glioma. Here, we elucidated the potential contribution of AEG-1 in human glioma pathogenesis. In glioma cells, AEG-1 could directly interact with Murine Double Minute-2 (MDM2) protein resulting in MDM2-p53-mediated cell proliferation and apoptosis. MDM2 is being revealed as an oncoprotein, which is involved in many human cancers progression. By immunohistochemical and a multivariate analysis, expressions of AEG-1 and MDM2 were elevated in glioma and high AEG-1 and MDM2 expressions were showed to be correlated with poor prognosis. AEG-1-MDM2 interaction prolonged stabilization of MDM2 where AEG-1 inhibited ubiquitination and subsequent proteasome-mediated degradation of MDM2 protein. Moreover, slicing AEG-1 blocked MDM2 expression and then impacted MDM2-p53 pathway that influenced cell proliferation and apoptosis. These findings uncover a novel AEG-1-MDM2 interplay by which AEG-1 augments glioma progression and reveal a viable potential therapy for the treatment of glioma patients.","Validation of the Limiting Antigen Avidity Assay to Estimate Level and Trends in HIV Incidence in an A/D Epidemic in Rakai, Uganda.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30560723,AIDS research and human retroviruses,2019 04 17,"The limiting-antigen avidity (LAg-Avidity) assay with viral load (VL) >1,000 copies/mL is being used to estimate population-level HIV incidence in Africa. However, this has not been validated in East Africa where HIV-1 subtypes A and D circulate. Sera from persons seen in two surveys (2008-2009 and 2012-2013) limited to those who attended the previous round of the Rakai Community Cohort in Uganda were analyzed. The performance of the current LAg-Avidity protocol, with a mean duration of recent infection (MDRI) of 130 days and false recent rate (FRR) of 0%, was compared with subtype-specific MDRI and FRR, adjusted to subtype distributions. The observed incidence was 1.05/100 person years (py) [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.90-1.23] in 2008-2009 and 0.66/100 py (95% CI 0.52-0.83) in 2012-2013. In contrast, the per-protocol LAg-Avidity incidence estimates were 1.63/100 py (95% CI 0.97-2.30) in 2008-2009 and 2.55/100 py (95% CI 1.51-3.59) in 2012-2013 (a significant increase, p < .05.)

In this subtype A/D epidemic, the per protocol LAg-Avidity + VL assay overestimated HIV incidence and failed to detect declines in incidence. Adjustment for FRR, MDRI, and subtype distribution provided incidence estimates similar to empirically observed incidence level and trends.

Fifty-six mothers and children (aged 12-42 months) including mothers with a diagnosis of IPV-PTSD were studied. Mentalization was measured by the Parental Reflective Functioning (PRF) Scale. Interactive behavior during free-play was measured via the CARE-Index. Child symptoms were measured by the Infant-Toddler Social and Emotional Assessment (ITSEA). Data analyses included non-parametric correlations and multiple linear regression. Results showed that lower IPV-PTSD and higher Maternal Reflective Functioning (MRF) were related to greater maternal sensitivity. Lower MRF and greater controlling behavior were related to child dysregulation. MRF was found to be lower in the subgroup of IPV-PTSD when the child's father was the perpetrator of IPV. Both MRF and interactive behavior are thus likely to be important targets for intervention during sensitive periods of early social-emotional development."

In an effort to better understand this association, we assessed the associations of discriminatory distress with UAI among a sample of 183 American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) MSM using survey data drawn from the HONOR Project. Design The HONOR Project examined the relationship between trauma, coping, and health behaviors among Two-Spirits (a contemporary name for gender and sexual minorities among American Indian and Alaska Native people). Results Using multivariable logistic regression techniques, our analysis showed participants reporting higher mean levels of distress from two-spirit discrimination had higher odds of reporting UAI (OR = 1.99, 95% CI, 1.19-3.32) compared to those reporting lower levels of distress. This analysis also showed lower odds of engaging in UAI among participants reporting higher levels of participation in LGBT specific online forums (OR = 0.86, CI = 0.75, 0.99; p < .05) and attending Two-Spirit events (OR = 0.82, CI = 0.71, 0.94; p < .01).

In this review, our primary aim has been to establish whether, despite the well-publicised implications of the ruling in the legal community, the medical profession has altered its practice. To do this, we reviewed the consenting methods applied by surgeons within our field of neurosurgery. We chose the rare, but disabling, material risk of prone spinal surgery: post-operative visual loss (POVL), as our tool for assessment. Departmental and national surveys both identified a common theme - the vast majority of doctors consenting patients for prone spinal surgery either do not consider POVL to be a serious material risk, or alternatively are not aware that current legal standards require them to ensure that patients are made aware of 'any' material risk involved in their treatment. In light of this finding, we discuss the legal implications of the Montgomery ruling, the current regulatory guidance available to support doctors, suggest some strategies to align clinical practice with the legal standards advocated by the ruling, and highlight some of the challenges surrounding the consent process given the legal framework in which we now practice.",Prevalence of smoking and clinical characteristics in fibromuscular dysplasia.

The unexpected 50% rise of activity for an enzyme which acts as a very efficient catalyst for CO2 hydration/bicarbonate dehydration, such as the blood CA, deserves further investigations for better understanding the physiologic basis of this phenomenon.",Protease-activated receptor 4 activity promotes platelet granule release and platelet-leukocyte interactions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30560697,Platelets,2019 06 10,"Human platelets express two protease-activated receptors (PARs), PAR1 (F2R) and PAR4 (F2RL3), which are activated by a number of serine proteases that are generated during pathological events and cause platelet activation. Recent interest has focused on PAR4 as a therapeutic target, given PAR4 seems to promote experimental thrombosis and procoagulant microparticle formation, without a broadly apparent role in hemostasis. However, it is not yet known whether PAR4 activity plays a role in platelet-leukocyte interactions, which are thought to contribute to both thrombosis and acute or chronic thrombo-inflammatory processes. We sought to determine whether PAR4 activity contributes to granule secretion from activated platelets and platelet-leukocyte interactions. We performed in vitro and ex vivo studies of platelet granule release and platelet-leukocyte interactions in the presence of PAR4 agonists including PAR4 activating peptide, thrombin, cathepsin G, and plasmin in combination with small-molecule PAR4 antagonists. Activation of human platelets with thrombin, cathepsin G, or plasmin potentiated platelet dense granule secretion that was specifically impaired by PAR4 inhibitors. Platelet-leukocyte interactions and platelet P-selectin exposure the following stimulation with PAR4 agonists were also impaired by activated PAR4 inhibition in either a purified system or in whole blood. These results indicate PAR4-specific promotion of platelet granule release and platelet-leukocyte aggregate formation and suggest that pharmacological control of PAR4 activity could potentially attenuate platelet granule release or platelet-leukocyte interaction-mediated pathological processes.",Increased subchondral bone thickness in hips with cam-type femoroacetabular impingement.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30560696,Hip international : the journal of clinical and experimental research on hip pathology and therapy,2019 06 13,Increased thickness of subchondral acetabular bone with associated articular cartilage thinning in hips with femoroacetabular (FAI) cam impingement has been observed on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

Lung cellular and molecular physiology,2019 04 12,"Corticosteroids (CSs) are commonly used to manage wheezing and asthma in pediatric populations. Although corticosteroids are effective in alleviating airway diseases, some children with more moderate-severe asthma phenotypes show CS resistance and exhibit significant airflow obstruction, persistent inflammation, and more frequent exacerbations. Previous studies have demonstrated that Th1 cytokines, such as TNF-α and IFN-γ, promote CS resistance in adult human airway smooth muscle (ASM). In the present study, using a human fetal ASM cell model, we tested the hypothesis that TNF-α/IFN-γ induces CS resistance. In contrast to TNF-α or IFN-γ alone, the combination of TNF-α/IFN-γ blunted the ability of fluticasone propionate (FP) to reduce expression of the chemokines CCL5 and CXCL10 despite expression of key anti-inflammatory glucocorticoid receptor target genes being largely unaffected by TNF-α/IFN-γ. Expression of the NF-κB subunit p65 and phosphorylation of Stat1 were elevated in cells treated with TNF-α/IFN-γ, an effect that remained in the presence of FP. siRNA knockdown studies demonstrated the effects of TNF-α/IFN-γ on increased p65 are mediated by Stat1, a transcription factor activated by IFN-γ. Expression of TNFAIP3, a negative regulator of NF-κB activity, was not altered by TNF-α/IFN-γ. However, the effects of TNF-α/IFN-γ were partially reduced by overexpression of TNFAIP3 but did not influence p65 expression. Together, these data suggest that IFN-γ augments the effects of TNF-α on chemokines by enhancing expression of key inflammatory pathways in the presence of CS. Interactions between TNF-α- and IFN-γ-mediated pathways may promote inflammation in asthmatic children resistant to CSs.",The prevention effects of cryptotanshinone nanoemulsion on postoperative peritoneal adhesions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30560692,Drug development and industrial pharmacy,2019 03 28,"The purpose of this study was to prepare a novel cryptotanshinone-loaded nanoemulsion (Cry LN) and to evaluate its prevention effect on the postoperative peritoneal adhesions (PPA). The Cry LN was prepared by high-pressure homogenization method, and various methods were used to investigate the physicochemical properties. The results showed that Cry LN has nanoscale particle size with uniform distribution and could slowly release the incorporated drug compared with Cry solution. With superior safety, Cry LN could increase the ratio of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA)/plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) up to 673% compared with control group. Furthermore, in vivo animal study confirmed the Cry LN activated the fibrinolytic system and successfully prevented PPA formation in rat. In conclusion, Cry nanoemulsion could be considered as a potentially promising and effective strategy for PPA treatment."

We argue that the strong DIBs at 9632 and 9577 Å correspond to the cold excitations from the non-Franck-Condon region of the ground electronic state to the two components of the lowest 2 E1 g state split by Jahn-Teller distortion. The weak DIBs at 9428 and 9365 Å are assigned to the first vibronic transitions involving the low-energy vibrational modes and components of the lowest 2 E1 g electronic state.",Averaging Strategy To Reduce Variability in Target-Decoy Estimates of False Discovery Rate.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30560673,Journal of proteome research,2019 02 01,"Decoy database search with target-decoy competition (TDC) provides an intuitive, easy-to-implement method for estimating the false discovery rate (FDR) associated with spectrum identifications from shotgun proteomics data.

The average TDC (aTDC) protocol combats this problem by exploiting multiple independently shuffled decoy databases to provide an FDR estimate with reduced variability. We provide a tutorial introduction to aTDC, describe an improved variant of the protocol that offers increased statistical power, and discuss how to deploy aTDC in practice using the Crux software toolkit.",Engineered Paramagnetic Graphene Quantum Dots with Enhanced Relaxivity for Tumor Imaging.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30560672,Nano letters,2019 05 28,"Nano contrast agents (Nano CA) are nanomaterials used to increase contrast in the medical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, the related relaxation mechanism of the Nano CA is not clear yet and little significant breakthrough in relaxivity enhancement has been achieved. Herein, a new hydrophilic Gd-DOTA complex functionalized with different chain length of PEG was synthesized and incorporated into graphene quantum dots (GQD) to obtain paramagnetic graphene quantum dots (PGQD). We performed a variable-temperature and variable-field intensity NMR study in aqueous solution on the water exchange and rotational dynamics of three different chain lengths of PGQD. The optimal GQD with paramagnetic chain length shows a great improvement in performance on 1H NMR relaxometric studies. In vitro results demonstrated that the relaxivity of the designed PGQD could be controlled by regulating the PEG length, and its relaxivity was ∼16 times higher than that of current commercial MRI contrast agents (e.g., Gd-DTPA), on a ""per Gd"" basis. The relaxivity of the Nano CA can be rationally tuned to obtain unmatched potentials in MR imaging, exemplified by preparation of the paramagnetic GQD with the enhanced T1 relaxivity. The fabricated PGQDs with suitable PEG length got the best relaxivity at 1.5 T. After intravenous injection, its feeding process by solid tumor could even be monitored by clinically used 1.5 T MRI scanners.

Resonance fluorescence on a quantum dot provides the access to a solid-state single photon source, where the environment is unfortunately the source of spin and charge noise that leads to fluctuations of the emission frequency and destroys the needed indistinguishability. We demonstrate a built-in stabilization approach for the photon stream, which relies solely on charge carrier dynamics of a two-dimensional hole gas inside a micropillar structure. The hole gas is fed by hole tunneling from field-ionized excitons and influences the energetic position of the excitonic transition by changing the local electric field at the position of the quantum dot. The standard deviation of the photon noise is suppressed by nearly 50% (noise power reduction of 6 dB) and it works in the developed micropillar structure for frequencies up to 1 kHz.

The accumulated trap charges at low current induce charge recombination at the interface and degrade the ideality factor of the diode and the fill factor (FF) of the solar cell. This consequently gives rise to a nonlinear current-voltage ( I- V) feature in solar cells, commonly known as an S-shaped kink, which can be engineered by optimizing the interface barrier thickness or by increasing the carrier mobility. Here, we present chemical and electrochemical doping methods to increase the conductivity of graphene that transforms nonlinear kink photodiodes with a low FF and solar cell efficiency towards trap-free linear photovoltaic I- V. Space-charge-limited-current manifested Ohmic I- V diode behavior with enhanced conductance in graphene by injecting homogeneous ionic liquid; confirming the significant reduction of trap charge density. This was further congruent with the disappearance of the nonlinear kink in photodiodes with a high FF and nearly ideal diodes.

Thus, nanoparticles are investigated as potential novel antifungals. We report that nanoparticles' antifungal activity strongly depends on their binding to fungal spores, focusing on the clinically important fungal pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus as well as common plant pathogens, such as Botrytis cinerea. We show that nanoparticle-spore complex formation was enhanced by the small nanoparticle size rather than the material, shape or charge, and could not be prevented by steric surface modifications. Fungal resistance to metal-based nanoparticles, such as ZnO-, Ag-, or CuO-nanoparticles as well as dissolution-resistant quantum dots, was mediated by biomolecule coronas acquired in pathophysiological and ecological environments, including the lung surfactant, plasma or complex organic matters. Mechanistically, dose-dependent corona-mediated resistance occurred via reducing physical adsorption of nanoparticles to fungal spores. The inhibitory effect of biomolecules on the antifungal activity of Ag-nanoparticles was further verified in vivo, using the invertebrate Galleria mellonella as an A. fumigatus infection model. Our results explain why current nanoantifungals often show low activity in realistic application environments, and will guide nanomaterial designs that maximize functionality and safe translatability as potent antifungals for human health, biotechnology, and agriculture.",Hydrogen-Deuterium Exchange Epitope Mapping Reveals Distinct Neutralizing Mechanisms for Two Monoclonal Antibodies against Diphtheria Toxin.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30560647,Biochemistry,2019 02 12,"The diphtheria toxoid (DT) antigen is one of the major components in pediatric and booster combination vaccines and is known to raise a protective humoral immune response upon vaccination.

Monoclonal antibody 2-25 binds selectively to the B-subunit (translocation and receptor domain) of DTx, blocking the heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HBEGF) binding site. In contrast, mAb 2-18 binds to the A-subunit (catalytic domain), partially covering the catalytic loop region that shuttles NAD during catalysis.

Perinatal lumbar discectomy for lumbar disc herniation or cauda equina syndrome is a rare clinical scenario. This case series outlines the surgical management of this clinical scenario at a national tertiary referral centre over a 10-year period
Methods
A retrospective review of all females who underwent discectomy / decompression for lumbar disc herniation or cauda equina syndrome in the perinatal period at a national tertiary referral centre for spine surgery over a 10-year period between January 2008 to December 2017.
Results
6 cases required surgical intervention. All patients were successfully managed with surgical decompressive procedures and recovered well in the postoperative period without complication.
Conclusions

The macroautophagy/autophagy pathway is highly conserved across eukaryotic cells and promotes cell survival during stressful conditions. In general, basal autophagy occurs at a low level to sustain cellular homeostasis and metabolism. However, autophagy is robustly upregulated in response to nutrient deprivation, pathogen infection and increased accumulation of potentially toxic protein aggregates and superfluous organelles. Within the cell, RNA decay maintains quality control to remove aberrant transcripts and regulate appropriate levels of gene expression.

However, when analyzing patients with concurrent ovarian carcinoma and tubal lesion, the extensive carcinoma tissues present at diagnosis may have effaced the natural habitat of precursor clone(s), obscuring tumor clonal evolutionary history, or may have disseminated to anatomically adjacent fimbriae ends, masquerading as precursor lesions. To circumvent these limitations, we analyzed the genomic landscape of incidental tubal precursor lesions including p53 signature, dormant STIC or serous tubal intraepithelial lesion (STIL) and proliferative STIC in women without ovarian carcinoma or any cancer diagnosis using whole-exome sequencing and amplicon sequencing. In three of the four cancer-free women with multiple discrete tubal lesions we observed non-identical TP53 mutations between precursor lesions from the same individual. In one of the four women with co-existing ovarian HGSC and tubal precursor lesion we found non-identical TP53 mutations and a lack of common mutations shared between her precursor lesion and carcinoma. Analyzing the evolutionary history of multiple tubal lesions in the same four patients with concurrent ovarian carcinoma indicated distinct evolution trajectories. Collectively, the results support diverse clonal origins of tubal precursor lesions at the very early stages of tumorigenesis. Mathematical modeling based on lesion-specific proliferation rates indicated that p53 signature and dormant STIC may take a prolonged time (two decades or more) to develop into STIC, whereas STIC may progress to carcinoma in a much shorter time (6 years). The above findings may have implications for future research aimed at prevention and early detection of ovarian cancer. Copyright © 2018 Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.

To address this, practice placements in non-traditional settings have been recommended; however, limited evidence exists to guide this innovation. This study aimed to address this gap by exploring the challenges and facilitators of a community-based, student-led placement involving physiotherapy undergraduate students and community-based groups.","Co-occurrence of pederin-producing and Wolbachia endobacteria in Paederus fuscipes Curtis, 1840 (Coleoptera: Staphilinidae) and its evolutionary consequences.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30560551,MicrobiologyOpen,2018 12 18,"The dual occurrence of Pseudomonas-like and Wolbachia endobacteria has not been investigated in the Pederus beetles yet. We investigated pederin-producing bacteria (PPB) infection in Paederus fuscipes specimens from the southern margins of the Caspian Sea by designed genus-specific (OprF) and species-specific (16S rRNA) primers. Wolbachia infection was studied through a nested-PCR assay of Wolbachia surface protein (wsp) gene. Of the 125 analyzed beetles, 42 females (82.35%) and 15 males (20.27%) were positive to PPB infection; this is the first study reporting male P. fuscipes infection to PPB. Wolbachia infection was found in 45 female (88.23%) and 50 male (67.57%) analyzed beetles. Surprisingly, a number of 36 females (70.59%) and 13 males (17.57%) were found to be infected with both PPB and Wolbachia endosymbionts. In general, population infection rates to PPB and Wolbachia were determined to be 45.6% and 76%, respectively. The infection rates of female beetles to PPB and PPB-Wolbachia were significantly higher than males. In Paederus species, only female beetles shelter PPB and the discovery of this bacterium in adult males may reflect their cannibalistic behavior on the contaminated stages. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the sequences of OprF gene were unique among Pseudomonas spp.; however, sequences of 16S rRNA gene were related to the PPB of Pederus species. The co-occurrence and random distribution of these endobacteria may imply putative tripartite interactions among PPB, Wolbachia, and Paederus. In order to elucidate these possible tripartite interactions, further studies are required even at gender level.",Pyramids and cascades: a synthesis of food chain functioning and stability.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30560550,Ecology letters,2019 04 30,"Food chain theory is one of the cornerstones of ecology, providing many of its basic predictions, such as biomass pyramids, trophic cascades and predator-prey oscillations. Yet, ninety years into this theory, the conditions under which these patterns may occur and persist in nature remain subject to debate. Rather than address each pattern in isolation, we propose that they must be understood together, calling for synthesis in a fragmented landscape of theoretical and empirical results. As a first step, we propose a minimal theory that combines the long-standing energetic and dynamical approaches of food chains. We chart theoretical predictions on a concise map, where two main regimes emerge: across various functioning and stability metrics, one regime is characterised by pyramidal patterns and the other by cascade patterns. The axes of this map combine key physiological and ecological variables, such as metabolic rates and self-regulation. A quantitative comparison with data sheds light on conflicting theoretical predictions and empirical puzzles, from size spectra to causes of trophic cascade strength. We conclude that drawing systematic connections between various existing approaches to food chains, and between their predictions on functioning and stability, is a crucial step in confronting this theory to real ecosystems.",HOXB13 interaction with MEIS1 modifies proliferation and gene expression in prostate cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30560549,The Prostate,2019 01 18,"The recurrent p.Gly84Glu germline mutation (G84E) in HOXB13 is consistently associated with prostate cancer (PCa), although the mechanisms underlying such linkage remain elusive.

Globally, foliar uptake of metal(loid)s occurs for vegetables/crops grown in the vicinity of industrial or urban areas with a metal-PM-contaminated atmosphere. The current study evaluated the foliar uptake of arsenic (As), accumulation of As in different plant organs, its toxicity (in terms of ROS generation, chlorophyll degradation, and lipid peroxidation), and its defensive mechanism (antioxidant enzymes) in spinach (Spinacia oleracea) after foliar application of As in the form of nanoparticles (As-NPs). The As-NPs were prepared using a chemical method. Results indicate that spinach can absorb As via foliar pathways (0.50 to 0.73 mg/kg in leaves) and can translocate it towards root tissues (0.35 to 0.68 mg/kg). However, health risk assessment parameters showed that the As level in the edible parts of spinach was below the critical limit (hazard quotient < 1). Despite low tissue level, As-NP exposure caused phytotoxicity in terms of a decrease in plant dry biomass (up to 84%) and pigment contents (up to 38%). Furthermore, several-fold higher activities of antioxidant enzymes were observed under metal stress than control. However, no significant variation was observed in the level of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), which can be its possible transformation to other forms of reactive oxygen species (ROS). It is proposed that As can be absorbed by spinach via foliar pathway and then disturbs the plant metabolism. Therefore, air quality needs to be considered and monitored continuously for the human health risk assessment and quality of vegetables cultivated on polluted soils (roadside and industrial vicinity). Graphical abstract ᅟ.",Temperature sensitivity of different soil carbon pools under biochar addition.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30560533,Environmental science and pollution research international,2019 03 18,"The objective of this study was to investigate the temperature sensitivity of labile and relatively recalcitrant forest soil carbon (C) pools amended with biochar during short-term incubation. Biochars were prepared using sugar cane residue under pyrolysis temperatures of 300 and 700 °C (i.e., BC300 and BC700), respectively. Coarse particulate organic matter and acid hydrolysis residue were separated from a forest soil and treated as the labile and recalcitrant C pools of the soil, respectively. Temperature sensitivity of the soil C pools was characterized using the Q10 values (i.e., the proportional increase in respiration per 10 °C rise). The increased Q10 values of treatments in the earlier stage were attributable to instantaneously increased aromatic C content. The following decreased Q10 values were related to the consumption of labile C. However, the two types of biochars led to similar Q10 values in the same C pools at the later stage of incubation, which was closely related to the nearly humic-like component content in the dissolved organic matter. The different temporal distributions of Q10 values were attributable to changes of aromatic C content and continuous consumption of labile components.","Biochemical, molecular, and elemental profiling of Withania somnifera L. with response to zinc stress.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30560532,Environmental science and pollution research international,2019 03 18,"Zn stress seriously induces various toxic responses in Withania somnifera L., when accumulated above the threshold level which was confirmed by investigating the responses of protein, expression of antioxidant enzymes, and elemental profiling on accumulation of Zn. Zn was supplemented in the form of ZnSO4 (0, 25, 50, 100, and 200 μM) through MS liquid medium and allowed to grow the in vitro germinated plants for 7 and 14 days. The study revealed that when the application of Zn increased, a significant reduction of growth characteristics was noticed with alterations of proteins (both disappearance and de novo synthesis). The activity of CAT, SOD, and GPX were increased up to certain concentrations and then declined, which confirmed through in-gel activity under different treatments. RT-PCR was conducted by taking three sets of genes from CAT (RsCat, Catalase1, Cat1) and SOD (SodCp, TaSOD1.2, MnSOD) and found that gene RsCat from CAT and MnSOD from SOD have shown maximum expression of desired genes under Zn stress, which indicate plant's stress tolerance mechanisms. The proton-induced X-ray emission study confirmed an increasing order of uptake of Zn in plants by suppressing and expressing other elemental constituents which cause metal homeostasis. This study provides insights into molecular mechanisms associated with Zn causing toxicity to plants; however, cellular and subcellular studies are essential to explore molecule-molecule interaction during Zn stress in plants.","Multiple lines of evidence of sediment quality in an urban Marine Protected Area (Xixová-Japuí State Park, SP, Brazil).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30560531,Environmental science and pollution research international,2019 05 20,"Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) aim to protect habitats, biodiversity, and ecological processes as a conservation tool. These areas have been affected by contamination, which threats the biodiversity and ecological functioning. In this study, we evaluated the sediment quality of Xixová-Japuí State Park (XJSP), an MPA located in an urbanized Bay (Santos, Southeast Brazil) by integrating multiple lines-of-evidence. Six sites were selected within the XJSP and analyzed for sediment chemistry, toxicity, and benthic community descriptors using Sediment Quality Triad approach (SQT). Whole-sediment Toxicity Identification Evaluation (TIE) was employed as a complementary line of evidence to confirm the presence of domestic effluent discharges as a potential stressor. The SQT showed that sediments collected within XJSP are impacted by contaminants, exhibiting chronic toxicity and changes in benthic community. TIE results indicated that trace metals, organic contaminants, and ammonia contributed to the observed effects. Our results also indicate a lack of effectiveness of MPA in protecting the biodiversity due to the contamination sources, which requires efforts to pollution control in order to ensure the environmental conservation and management plan goals.","Calcium ion incorporated hydrous iron(III) oxide: synthesis, characterization, and property exploitation towards water remediation from arsenite and fluoride.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30560530,Environmental science and pollution research international,2019 05 20,"Calcium ion-incorporated hydrous iron(III) oxide (CIHIO) samples have been prepared aiming investigation of efficiency enhancement on arsenic and fluoride adsorption of hydrous iron(III) oxide (HIO). Characterization of the optimized product with various analytical tools confirms that CIHIO is microcrystalline and mesoporous (pore width, 26.97 Å; pore diameter, 27.742 Å with pore volume 0.18 cm3 g-1) material. Increase of the BET surface area (> 60%) of CIHIO (269.61 m2 g-1) relative to HIO (165.6 m2 g-1) is noticeable. CIHIO particles are estimated to be ~ 50 nm from AFM and TEM analyses. Although the pH optimized for arsenite and fluoride adsorptions are different, the efficiencies of CIHIO towards their adsorption are very good at pH 6.5 (pHzpc). The adsorption kinetics and equilibrium data of either tested species agree well, respectively, with pseudo-second order model and Langmuir monolayer adsorption phenomenon. Langmuir capacities (mg g-1at 303 K) estimated are 29.07 and 25.57, respectively, for arsenite and fluoride. The spontaneity of adsorption reactions (ΔG0 = - 18.02 to - 20.12 kJ mol-1 for arsenite; - 0.2523 to - 3.352 kJ mol-1 for fluoride) are the consequence of entropy parameter. The phosphate ion (1 mM) compared to others influenced adversely the arsenite and/or fluoride adsorption reactions. CIHIO (2.0 g L-1) is capable to abstract arsenite or fluoride above 90% from their solution (0 to 5.0 mg L-1). Mechanism assessment revealed that the adsorption of arsenite occurs via chelation, while of fluoride occurs with ion-exchange.",Effects of the co-disposal of lignite fly ash and coal mine waste rocks on AMD and leachate quality.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30560529,Environmental science and pollution research international,2019 03 18,"Lignite fly ash (FA) and waste rocks (WRs) were mixed in three different ratios (1:1, 1:3 and 1:5) and studied to compare the effects of adding FA on acid mine drainage generation from coal mining WRs, leachability of elements and the potential occurrence of the secondary minerals. FA mixed with WRs showed significant differences in pH levels compared to previous research. The 1:1 mixture performed best of all the three mixtures in terms of pH and leachability of elements, mainly due to the higher proportion of FA in the mixture. The pH in the 1:1 mixtures varied between 3.3 and 5.1 compared to other mixtures (2.3-3.5). Iron and SO42- leached considerably less from the 1:1 mixture compared to the others, indicating that the oxidation of sulphides was weaker in this mixture. Aluminium leached to a high degree from all mixtures, with concentrations varying from mg L-1 to g L-1. The reason behind this increase is probably the addition of FA which, due to acidic conditions and the composition of the FA, increases the availability of Al. For the same reason, high concentrations of Mn and Zn were also measured. Geochemical modelling indicates that the 1:1 mixture performs better in terms of precipitation of Al3+ minerals, whereas Fe3+ minerals precipitated more in mixtures containing less FA. These results suggest that, with time, the pores could possibly be filled with these secondary minerals and sulphate salts (followed by a decrease in sulphide oxidation), improving the pore water pH and decreasing the leachability of elements. Since grain size plays a crucial role in the reactivity of sulphides, there is a risk that the results from the leaching tests may have been influenced by crushing and milling of the WR samples.",Effect of the adsorption pH and temperature on the parameters of the Brouers-Sotolongo models.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30560528,Environmental science and pollution research international,2018 12 18,"The goal of the present paper was to elucidate if-and how-the parameters of the Brouers-Sotolongo fractal (BSf) (n,α) kinetic model (α and τC) on the one hand, and of the generalised Brouers-Sotolongo (GBS) isotherm model (a and b) on the other hand, are correlated with adsorption pH and temperature. For that purpose, adsorption of aqueous solutions of two common dyes, methylene blue (MB) and methyl orange (MO) was carried out on four activated carbons (ACs) at three temperatures (25, 35 and 50 °C) and three pH (2.5, 5 and 8). Adsorption kinetics and isotherms were measured, and the corresponding curves were best fitted with specific forms of the aforementioned models, and corresponding to equations known as BSf (1,α) kinetic and Brouers-Gaspard isotherm models. Correlations between all model parameters and adsorption conditions were found, bringing some information about the adsorbate-adsorbent interaction.",Never put equipoise in appendix!

Moreover, the biologic function of the appendix is still unclear. For uncomplicated acute appendicitis the conservative treatment with antibiotics has been proposed with interesting results. The aim of this study was to compare surgical treatment vs. antibiotics in uncomplicated acute appendicitis. This is a monocentric randomized controlled trial comparing surgery with antibiotic therapy in adults with uncomplicated acute appendicitis. The primary outcome was the success rate (resolution of symptoms within 2 weeks and no need for further treatments); secondary outcomes were complication rate; negative appendectomy rate (only in surgical arm); and long-term outcomes within a year as recurrence. The study was designed as a non-inferiority trial. From September 2011 to December 2014, 224 patients fulfilled the eligibility criteria and 45 patients were randomized. Twenty four patients (53.3%) were randomly assigned to surgery and 21 (46.6%) to antibiotic therapy. In surgical group primary outcome was reached for all the patients; secondary negative outcomes were recorded in five patients (22.7%): two cases of negative appendectomies, three wound infections. In antibiotics group treatment fails in 16.8% of cases; secondary negative outcomes were recorded in one patient who experienced relapse of AA at 30 days No further events or complications were observed at 1-year follow-up. Due to the poor patients' accrual the study had no enough statistical power to demonstrate the non-inferiority of conservative treatment and results were inconclusive. Due to the poor patient's accrual rate the study failed to demonstrate the non-inferiority of conservative treatment in uncomplicated acute appendicitis.

Participants included 510 seventh and tenth grade students (Mage = 13.7, 61.6% girls, 44% Asian and 30% White) who completed surveys across three academic years in middle and high school. Findings from longitudinal path models suggest that internalizing symptoms and externalizing problems respectively were associated with increases in experiences of cyber victimization (beyond the effect of traditional victimization) both within and across time, particularly for adolescent girls.

Recent evidence suggests being known as ""popular"" among peers (perceived popularity) may be more detrimental during adolescence than being widely well-liked (sociometric popularity). Thus, this study sought to better understand how two dimensions of popularity (perceived and sociometric) may contribute to adolescents' own perceptions of satisfaction and happiness regarding their social life at school, and hypothesized that ""being popular"" would have a more complex (and curvilinear) association with adolescents' social contentment than previously considered by linear models. Adolescents' peer popularity and self-perceived social contentment were examined as both linear and curvilinear associations along each status continuum in a series of hierarchical regressions. Participants were 767 7th-grade students from two middle schools in the Midwest (52% female, 46% White, 45% African American). Perceived and sociometric popularity were assessed via peer nominations (""most popular"" and ""liked the most"", respectively). Self-reported social satisfaction, best friendship quality, social self-concept, and school belonging were assessed as aspects of social contentment. The results indicated that both high and low levels of perceived popularity, as well as high and low levels of sociometric popularity, predicted lower perceptions of social satisfaction, poorer best friendship quality, and lower social self-concept than youth with moderate levels of either status.

Both positive (i.e., prosocial) and negative (i.e., antisocial) moral behaviors occur on the playing field. To stimulate positive sports experiences, it is important to understand which factors are related to the moral behavior of young athletes; one of these is the moral climate, that is, the socio-moral environment in which sports take place. Little is known about the overall strength of the relationship between moral climate and moral behavior of young athletes, as well as the potential moderating factors of this relationship. A meta-analysis of 27 studies containing 117 effect sizes and N = 7726 young athletes (age < 18 years) was conducted. The results show that there is an overall significant association between these two variables (r= 0.40), indicating that a prosocial moral climate is related to less antisocial and more prosocial behavior, while an antisocial moral climate is associated with more antisocial and less prosocial behavior of young athletes. Two study characteristics significantly moderated this relationship: specifically, stronger associations were found in cross-sectional and in older studies. In addition, the strength of the association between moral climate and moral behavior was stronger for antisocial moral climate compared to prosocial moral climate. Finally, associations for team members were stronger than those of coaches or a broad moral club climate.

Our work aim is to investigate the prognostic factor in the LBHN subgroup and, meanwhile, try to obtain an optimal prognostic index (PI) contrapose LBHN subgroup which helps to guide chemotherapy. A total of 515 female LBNH patients who underwent diagnosis and surgery at our hospitals from August 2008 to August 2018 were enrolled. Clinical-pathological information was obtained and immunohistochemistry result was available. From these cases, a 30% Ki-67 LI was employed to divide LBHN into two groups with low and high levels; high Ki-67 LI was associated with GIII tumor grade (P < 0.001), positive axillary lymph nodes (ALN) status (P = 0.018) and negative PR status (P = 0.016), and also seemed to be related to T2-T3 tumor size (P = 0.058).

This raised the question as to whether cell phenotypes also differed among MT-2 cell lines. The influence of two different MT-2 cell lines (MT-2J and MT-2B) on the growth of the promonocytic leukemia cell line, U937, was investigated. Protein levels and mRNA expression of cytokines were also investigated. In addition, Western blot analysis of HTLV-1 regulatory proteins, Tax and HBZ, was also performed. Culture supernatant from MT-2B, but not MT-2J, cells showed marked suppressive effects on U937 cell growth. MT-2B showed high tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, TNF-β, and interferon (IFN)-γ both in protein levels of the culture supernatant and mRNA levels of the cells. Analysis using recombinant cytokines indicated that the suppressive effects of MT-2B were due, at least in part, to high levels of TNF-β and its synergic effects with IFN-γ in the culture supernatant. Protein levels of HTLV-1 Tax and HBZ were higher in MT-2B than those in MT-2J cells. These molecules have been reported to affect the cytokine production of HTLV-1 infected cells; therefore, the difference in these molecules may have accounted for the differences in cytokine production between MT-2J and MT-2B cells. Furthermore, because MT-2 cells showed a large variation of integrated HTLV-1 proviruses as well as cell phenotypes, it is important to exercise caution in the assessment and interpretation of experimental data from MT-2 cells.",Correcting for natural visuo-proprioceptive matching errors based on reward as opposed to error feedback does not lead to higher retention.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30560507,Experimental brain research,2019 06 13,"When asked to move their unseen hand-to-visual targets, people exhibit idiosyncratic but reliable visuo-proprioceptive matching errors. Unsurprisingly, vision and proprioception quickly align when these errors are made apparent by providing visual feedback of the position of the hand. However, retention of this learning is limited, such that the original matching errors soon reappear when visual feedback is removed. Several recent motor learning studies have shown that reward feedback can improve retention relative to error feedback. Here, using a visuo-proprioceptive position-matching task, we examined whether binary reward feedback can be effectively exploited to reduce matching errors and, if so, whether this learning leads to improved retention relative to learning based on error feedback. The results show that participants were able to adjust the visuo-proprioceptive mapping with reward feedback, but that the level of retention was similar to that observed when the adjustment was accomplished with error feedback. Therefore, similar to error feedback, reward feedback allows for temporary recalibration, but does not support long-lasting retention of this recalibration.",Expression Pattern of Long Non-coding RNAs in Schizophrenic Patients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30560506,Cellular and molecular neurobiology,2019 04 29,"The role of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in the pathogenesis of neurological disorders including schizophrenia has been highlighted by independent studies. In the present study, we compared peripheral blood expression of seven lncRNAs between schizophrenic patients and sex- and age-matched controls using quantitative real-time PCR technique. FAS-AS1, PVT1 and TUG1 were significantly down-regulated in schizophrenic patients compared with healthy individuals (P = 0.007, 0.003 and 0.001, respectively). The association between FAS-AS1 expression and schizophrenia was significant in male subjects aged more than 50 but not in other subgroups. GAS5, NEAT1 and OIP5-AS1 expressions were not significantly different between patients and controls (P = 0.523, 0.739 and 0.267, respectively). The associations between GAS5, NEAT1 and OIP5-AS1 expressions and schizophrenia were significant in female subjects but not in male subjects. THRIL was up-regulated in schizophrenic patients compared with healthy subjects. Based on the results of bootstraped median regression, and after controlling for the effects of age and sex, the difference in its expression between cases and controls was significant (P = 0.014), while the interaction between group and sex was not significant. The expression of lncRNAs was not correlated with age in any study subgroups. In addition, we found sex-based pairwise correlations between PVT1 expression and expression levels of OIP5-AS1, THRIL and NEAT1. We also demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity of GAS5 for diagnosis of schizophrenia in female patients. The current study provides further evidence for the participation of lncRNAs in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. Future studies are needed to confirm the suitability of lncRNAs as peripheral biomarkers for this psychiatric disorder.",The USER Study: A Chart Review of Patients Receiving a 0.2 µg/day Fluocinolone Acetonide Implant for Diabetic Macular Edema.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30560505,Ophthalmology and therapy,2019 03 29,"To determine anatomical, functional, and intraocular pressure (IOP) responses to diabetic macular edema (DME) treatments pre- and post-0.2 µg/day fluocinolone acetonide (FAc) implant administration compared with baseline and the preceding 3 years.",Higher Risk of Light-Induced Retinal Damage Due to Increase of Intraocular Irradiance by Endoillumination.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30560504,Ophthalmology and therapy,2019 03 29,"All applied illumination systems are validated according to a standard that measures in an experimental setup the direct radiation intensity on a surface in an aqueous solution, not involving an eyeball.

Despite these approaches, the question about the ""mobility"" of DNA especially in capital offenses cannot be answered in every case, since a variety of scenarios for DNA transfer are possible. The aim of this study was to investigate whether DNA traces could be distributed by cleaning an object. For this purpose, a large table surface and fabric piece were artificially provided with skin contact traces and body fluids (saliva and blood) in two series of experiments and then wiped off with water or with soap water (218 samples in total). These experiments resulted in a clear ""carry over"" of DNA traces especially for body fluid samples (100% of blood samples and 75% of saliva samples led to a complete profile). The results could be confirmed in a second experimental set-up with 384 samples using different cleaning agents and more intense cleaning actions. Even small amounts of 5-10 μl body fluid led to complete profiles in around 45% of the samples, while 20 μl led to nearly 65% complete profiles. A strong impact of the amount of traces and the chosen surface could be demonstrated, while the active component of the cleaning agent seemed to be of less influence with the explicit exception of chloric agents which rendered almost everything completely DNA-free. In summary, a distribution of DNA traces by wiping or scrubbing an object could be clearly proven.",Detection of Norovirus and Rotavirus Present in Suspended and Dissolved Forms in Drinking Water Sources.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30560490,Food and environmental virology,2019 03 29,"We investigated the present forms of genogroup II norovirus and group A rotavirus in surface water used for drinking water production. River water samples (N = 15) collected at a drinking water treatment plant (DWTP) monthly from June 2017 to August 2018 were fractioned by filtration through 10- and 0.45-μm-pore-size membranes, and viruses present in suspended and dissolved forms were quantitatively detected. Norovirus GII was present in > 10-μm- and 0.45-10-μm-suspended and dissolved forms with detection rates of 33%, 60%, and 87%, respectively. Rotavirus A was detected more frequently than norovirus GII in each form (> 10 μm suspended, 73%; 0.45-10 μm suspended, 93%; dissolved, 100%). We also analyzed surface water samples from 21 DWTPs all over Japan in non-epidemic and epidemic seasons of gastroenteritis.

Rotavirus A was detected in 95% and 86% of samples with the maximum concentrations of 5.5 and 6.3 log10 copies/L in dissolved form in respective seasons. Concentration of norovirus GII was similar in 0.45-10-μm suspended and dissolved forms, while there was a significant difference for rotavirus A (P < 0.01, pared t test), indicating that rotavirus A was less associated with suspended solids in the surface water samples compared to norovirus GII.

The current NCCN guidelines recommend VTE prophylaxis for up to 28 days after major abdominal or pelvic surgery for malignancy. We set out to evaluate the rate and timing of VTEs among patients with gastric, pancreatic, colorectal, and gynecologic malignancies who underwent surgery. We performed a retrospective review of the NSQIP database (2005-2013) focusing on patients with gastric, colorectal, pancreatic, and gynecologic malignancies. Our primary endpoint was a diagnosis of VTE within 30 days of surgery. We analyzed 128,864 patients in this study. On multivariable analysis, patients with pre-operative sepsis (OR 2.36, CI 2.04-2.76, p < 0.001), disseminated cancer (OR 1.73, CI 1.55-1.92, p < 0.001), congestive heart failure (OR 1.69, CI 1.25-2.28, p = 0.001), gastric cancer (OR 1.3, CI 1.09-1.56, p = 0.004), and pancreatic cancer (OR 1.2, CI 1.03-1.30, p = 0.021) were more likely to have a VTE. Of patients who had a VTE event, 34% occurred after discharge from surgery (gastric: 25%, colorectal 34%, pancreatic 31%, gynecologic malignancy 42%). Our study demonstrates that patients who undergo an operation for malignancy with pre-operative sepsis, disseminated cancer, congestive heart failure, gastric cancer, or pancreatic cancer are more likely to develop a VTE within 30 days of their operation. Of those patients who developed a VTE, approximately one-third occurred after discharge during a 30 day post-operative period. This data supports that further studies are needed to determine the appropriate length of post-operative VTE chemoprophylaxis in patients with cancer.",Thromboembolism and bleeding in patients with cancer and mechanical heart valves.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30560487,Journal of thrombosis and thrombolysis,2019 04 01,"Mechanical heart valves (MHV) require life-long anticoagulation with vitamin K antagonists (VKA), but anticoagulation management is complex in patients with cancer due to a high risk of thrombosis and bleeding. This is a retrospective, single-center study to assess anticoagulation management and thrombotic (stroke/valve thrombosis) and bleeding events in patients with active cancer and MHV. The incidence of thrombotic complications was compared to a control group (matched 1:1) of patients with MHV but without cancer. We included 48 patients, 60% of whom had aortic prostheses, 23% mitral prostheses and 17% both types. All patients received VKA as anticoagulant. With a median follow-up of 5.12 years, we observed two arterial thrombotic events (two strokes and no heart valve thrombosis). The 5-year incidence (95% confidence interval [CI]) of stroke/valve thrombosis was 5.7% (0.9-17.9%). The control group had a similar incidence of stroke/valve thrombosis (5-year incidence 7.9% [95%CI 2-19.8], p = 0.16). There were also 15 major bleeding episodes in the cancer group, 11 of which were related to a surgical procedure. The 5-year incidence (95% CI) of major bleeding was 32.9% (18.5-48%), and that of major bleeding unrelated to any procedure was 10.3% (3-23%). We found a low incidence of thrombotic events in this series of patients with active cancer and MHV who were anticoagulated with VKA. However, the incidence of bleeding was high, particularly in relation to invasive procedures.",Biomarker-Measured Unhealthy Alcohol Use in Relation to CD4 Count Among Individuals Starting ART in Sub-Saharan Africa.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30560484,AIDS and behavior,2019 06 10,"Individuals are initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART) at earlier HIV disease stages. Unhealthy alcohol use is a known barrier to successful HIV treatment outcomes, yet it is unclear whether the problem varies by disease stage. We measured alcohol use with an objective biomarker (phosphatidylethanol [PEth]), comparing individuals (n = 401) with early (CD4 > 350 cells/mL, WHO Stage 1) versus late (CD4 < 200 cells/mL) ART initiation in HIV care in Uganda and South Africa (SA). We examined the association between CD4 count and biomarker results using multivariable regression modeling, and compared PEth results to self-report to assess underreporting. Overall, 32.2% (n = 129) had unhealthy alcohol use (PEth ≥ 50 ng/ml). Early ART initiation was significantly associated with unhealthy alcohol use in Uganda (AOR 2.65; 95% CI: 1.05-6.72), but not SA (AOR 1.00; 95% CI: 0.46-2.17). In Uganda, 23.2% underreported unhealthy alcohol use versus 11.6% in SA (χ2 = 9.30; p < 0.01). Addressing unhealthy alcohol use is important as patients initiate ART earlier, yet challenging due to underreporting.",Evaluating Physicians' Intention to Discriminate Against Patients Living with HIV in Malaysia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30560483,AIDS and behavior,2019 04 13,"People with HIV (PWH) in Malaysia experience high levels of stigma, which may act as a barrier to accessing healthcare. Stigma against PWH in medical settings is understudied in Malaysia. In the present study, we examine factors associated with physicians' intention to discriminate against PWH in Malaysia. A cross-sectional online survey was emailed to all 1431 physicians at two major university hospitals in Malaysia; 568 (39.6%) participants completed the survey and were included in this analysis. Measures included intention to discriminate against PWH, stigma-related constructs, and socio-demographic characteristics. Multivariate linear regression was used to identify factors associated with intention to discriminate against PWH. Participants were comprised of women (53.5%), Malays (43.1%), and Chinese (35.0%) with nearly 10 years of clinical experience. Most participants were from non-surgical specialties (77.6%). The final multivariate linear regression showed that physicians who expressed greater discriminatory intent against PWH also expressed more negative feelings toward PWH, more HIV-related shame, were more fearful of HIV, and believed that PWH do not deserve good care. Physicians from surgical-based specialties were also significantly more likely to endorse discriminatory intent toward PWH. Stigma and intentions to discriminate against a class of patients, including PWH, can undermine engagement in care, which is central to international HIV prevention and treatment strategies. Interventions that reduce stigma toward PWH among physicians are crucial to ensuring equitable and stigma-free healthcare.",Correction to: Demineralized bone matrix and hydroxyapatite/tri-calcium phosphate mixture for bone healing in rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30560482,International orthopaedics,2019 05 13,The first name of one author is missing in the published article.

However, whether and how cognitive training produces long-term benefits remains unclear. Here, 10-month-old PR5 mice were spatially trained in a water maze for 4 consecutive weeks. The novel object recognition test (NORT), Western blots, Golgi staining, and ELISA were used to examine behavioral, biochemical, and pathological measures immediately after training and 3 months later. Immediately after training, we found that spatial training significantly improved cognitive performance; reduced tau neuropathology; increased the expression level of synaptophysin, PSD93, and PSD95 in the hippocampus; and increased the number of dendritic spines in PR5 mice. The expression levels of NLRP3, caspase-1, and interleukin (IL)-1β, which were significantly elevated in PR5 mice, were reversed by spatial training. Interestingly, these effects persisted 3 months later. To further detect the role of NLRP3 in spatial training, PR5/NLRP3-/- mice and PR5/NLRP3+/- mice were also used in our study. PR5/NLRP3-/- mice showed better cognitive performance than PR5 mice. After 1 week of spatial training, these changes (including those in expression levels of synaptophysin, PSD93, and PSD95; the number of dendritic spines; and caspase-1 and IL-1β content in PR5 mice) could be totally reversed in PR5/NLRP3-/- and PR5/NLRP3+/- mice. In addition, there was a positive correlation between NLRP3 content and the expression levels of caspase-1 and IL-1β. These results show an important role for the NLRP3/caspase-1/IL-1β axis in ameliorating the effect of spatial training on cognitive impairment in PR5 mice."

Theoretical and applied genetics. Theoretische und angewandte Genetik,2019 04 16,"New models for integration of major gene MAS with modern breeding approaches stand to greatly enhance the reliability and efficiency of breeding, facilitating the leveraging of traditional genetic diversity. Genetic diversity is well recognised as contributing essential variation to crop breeding processes, and marker-assisted selection is cited as the primary tool to bring this diversity into breeding programs without the associated genetic drag from otherwise poor-quality genomes of donor varieties. However, implementation of marker-assisted selection techniques remains a challenge in many breeding programs worldwide. Many factors contribute to this lack of adoption, such as uncertainty in how to integrate MAS with traditional breeding processes, lack of confidence in MAS as a tool, and the expense of the process. However, developments in genomics tools, locus validation techniques, and new models for how to utilise QTLs in breeding programs stand to address these issues. Marker-assisted forward breeding needs to be enabled through the identification of robust QTLs, the design of reliable marker systems to select for these QTLs, and the delivery of these QTLs into elite genomic backgrounds to enable their use without associated genetic drag. To enhance the adoption and effectiveness of MAS, rice is used as an example of how to integrate new developments and processes into a coherent, efficient strategy for utilising genetic variation. When processes are instituted to address these issues, new genes can be rolled out into a breeding program rapidly and completely with a minimum of expense.",Toward the sequence-based breeding in legumes in the post-genome sequencing era.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30560464,TAG. Theoretical and applied genetics. Theoretische und angewandte Genetik,2019 04 16,"Efficiency of breeding programs of legume crops such as chickpea, pigeonpea and groundnut has been considerably improved over the past decade through deployment of modern genomic tools and technologies. For instance, next-generation sequencing technologies have facilitated availability of genome sequence assemblies, re-sequencing of several hundred lines, development of HapMaps, high-density genetic maps, a range of marker genotyping platforms and identification of markers associated with a number of agronomic traits in these legume crops. Although marker-assisted backcrossing and marker-assisted selection approaches have been used to develop superior lines in several cases, it is the need of the hour for continuous population improvement after every breeding cycle to accelerate genetic gain in the breeding programs. In this context, we propose a sequence-based breeding approach which includes use of independent or combination of parental selection, enhancing genetic diversity of breeding programs, forward breeding for early generation selection, and genomic selection using sequencing/genotyping technologies. Also, adoption of speed breeding technology by generating 4-6 generations per year will be contributing to accelerate genetic gain. While we see a huge potential of the sequence-based breeding to revolutionize crop improvement programs in these legumes, we anticipate several challenges especially associated with high-quality and precise phenotyping at affordable costs, data analysis and management related to improving breeding operation efficiency. Finally, integration of improved seed systems and better agronomic packages with the development of improved varieties by using sequence-based breeding will ensure higher genetic gains in farmers' fields.",Analysis of genes encoding seed storage proteins (SSPs) in chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) reveals co-expressing transcription factors and a seed-specific promoter.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30560463,Functional & integrative genomics,2019 04 19,"Improvement of the quality and quantity of chickpea seed protein can be greatly facilitated by an understanding of the genic organization and the genetic architecture of the genes encoding seed storage proteins (SSPs). The aim of this study was to provide a comprehensive analysis of the chickpea SSP genes, putative co-expressing transcription factors (TFs), and to identify a seed-specific SSP gene promoter. A genome-wide identification of SSP genes in chickpea led to the identification of 21 non-redundant SSP encoding genes located on 6 chromosomes. Phylogenetic analysis grouped SSP genes into 3 subgroups where members within the same clade demonstrated similar motif composition and intron-exon organization. Tandem duplications were identified to be the major contributors to the expansion of the SSP gene family in chickpea. Co-expression analysis revealed 14 TFs having expression profiles similar to the SSP genes that included members of important TF families that are known to regulate seed development. Expression analysis of SSP genes and TFs revealed significantly higher expression in late stages of seed development as well as in high seed protein content (HPC) genotypes. In silico analysis of the promoter regions of the SSP encoding genes revealed several seed-specific cis-regulatory elements such as RY repeats, ACGT motifs, CAANTG, and GCN4. A candidate promoter was analyzed for seed specificity by generating stable transgenics in Arabidopsis. Overall, this study provides a useful resource to explore the regulatory networks involved in SSP synthesis and/or accumulation for utilization in developing nutritionally improved chickpea genotypes.",Examination of a paradox: recurrent metastatic breast cancer incidence decline without improved distant disease survival: 1990-2011.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30560462,Breast cancer research and treatment,2019 04 07,Distant relapse metastatic breast cancer (rMBC) incidence and survival are vital measures of breast cancer diagnosis and treatment progress over time.,Prevalence of breast cancer-related risk factors in underweight premenopausal women: the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey IV-VI.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30560460,Breast cancer research and treatment,2019 03 19,This study aimed to examine the prevalence and trends of breast cancer-related risk factors and characteristics in premenopausal underweight Korean women according to birth year cohort.,Oral bisphosphonates and incidence of cancers in patients with osteoporosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30560459,Archives of osteoporosis,2018 12 18,"Several previous studies have shown that oral bisphosphonates (BPs) are associated with the incidence of 13 specific cancers, including lung cancer, esophageal cancer, gastric cancer, and colorectal cancer (CRC).

Recent studies have indicated that these cells express GPR120 (also known as FFAR4), the G protein-coupled receptor for long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs). However, functional implications of this receptor in brush cells have remained elusive. Here, we show that a great proportion of brush cells express GPR120. We used phosphorylation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2) as a readout to monitor brush cell responses to the LCFAs oleic acid and α-linolenic acid. Our results demonstrate that ERK1/2 phosphorylation is increased upon exposure to both fatty acids. Increased ERK1/2 phosphorylation is accompanied by upregulated mRNA and protein levels of cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2), a key enzyme for prostaglandin biosynthesis. Immunohistochemical experiments confirmed that oleic acid caused ERK1/2 phosphorylation and induced COX-2 expression in brush cells. Our results indicate that LCFA sensing elicits a signaling process in brush cells that may be relevant for a local regulation of gastric functions.",Moyamoya angiopathy: long-term follow-up study in a Finnish population.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30560456,Journal of neurology,2019 06 06,Moyamoya angiopathy (MMA) is a chronic cerebrovascular disorder predominantly starting in childhood or early adulthood and thus affects the whole lifetime.

One such recently described encephalitis is due to antibodies directed at alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors (AMPAR). This entity is exceptionally rare and its clinical phenotype incompletely described. We present findings from two cases of AMPAR encephalitis that exemplify variability in the disease spectrum, and summarize findings in published cases derived from a systematic literature review. When all patients are considered together, the presence of psychiatric symptoms at presentation portended a poor outcome and was associated with the presence of a tumor. Furthermore, we provide evidence to suggest that the topography of magnetic resonance imaging abnormalities in reported cases mirrors the distribution of AMPARs in the human brain. The potential for neurological improvement following immunomodulatory therapy together with the favorable outcome reported in most cases emphasizes the importance of testing for autoantibodies against neuronal cell-surface proteins, including AMPAR, in patients with clinical and neuroimaging findings suggestive of autoimmune encephalitis.

We give a mathematically rigorous proof of the characteristic right skewness of the incubation time distribution for very general one-dimensional diffusion models. Imposing natural simple conditions on the drift coefficient, we also study these diffusion models under the assumption of noise smallness and show that the limiting exit time distributions in the limit of vanishing noise are Gaussian and Gumbel. Thus, they match the existing data as well as the other existing models do. The character of our models, however, allows us to argue that the features of the exit time distributions that we describe are universal and manifest themselves in various other situations where the times involved can be described as detection or halting times, for example response times studied in psychology.",Effect on comfort of administering bubble-humidified or dry oxygen: the Oxyrea non-inferiority randomized study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30560440,Annals of intensive care,2019 01 08,The clinical interest of using bubble humidification of oxygen remains controversial.

Both parametric and weakly parametric marginal distributions under the proportional hazards assumption are considered. Extensive simulation studies are conducted to evaluate the Type I error control and power performance of the proposed method. Finally, we apply our method to a large randomized trial data, the Age-related Eye Disease Study, to identify susceptible risk variants for AMD progression.

Currently, however, the treatment of chronic pain after SCI remains a largely unmet need. Electrical spinal cord stimulation (SCS) has been used to manage a variety of chronic pain conditions that are refractory to pharmacotherapy. Yet, its efficacy, benefit profiles, and mechanisms of action in SCI pain remain elusive, due to limited research, methodological weaknesses in previous clinical studies, and a lack of mechanistic exploration of SCS for SCI pain control. We aim to review recent studies and outline the therapeutic potential of different SCS paradigms for traumatic SCI pain. We begin with an overview of its manifestations, classification, potential underlying etiology, and current challenges for its treatment. The clinical evidence for using SCS in SCI pain is then reviewed.

Our previous study showed that neonatal maternal deprivation (NMD) does not induce visceral hypersensitivity at the age of 6 weeks in rats. The aim of this study was to determine whether NMD followed by adult stress at the age of 6 weeks induces visceral pain in rats and to investigate the roles of adrenergic signaling in visceral pain. Here we showed that NMD rats exhibited visceral hypersensitivity 6 h and 24 h after the termination of adult multiple stressors (AMSs). The plasma level of norepinephrine was significantly increased in NMD rats after AMSs. Whole-cell patch-clamp recording showed that the excitability of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons from NMD rats with AMSs was remarkably increased. The expression of β2 adrenergic receptors at the protein and mRNA levels was markedly higher in NMD rats with AMSs than in rats with NMD alone. Inhibition of β2 adrenergic receptors with propranolol or butoxamine enhanced the colorectal distention threshold and application of butoxamine also reversed the enhanced hypersensitivity of DRG neurons. Overall, our data demonstrate that AMS induces visceral hypersensitivity in NMD rats, in part due to enhanced NE-β2 adrenergic signaling in DRGs.",Next-Generation Tools to Study Autonomic Regulation In Vivo.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30560436,Neuroscience bulletin,2019 04 09,"The recent development of tools to decipher the intricacies of neural networks has improved our understanding of brain function.

Interferon-γ (IFNγ)-mediated type I cell-mediated immune response plays an important role in protection from, and clearance of, PRRS virus (PRRSV). Several lymphocyte subsets including T-helper, CTLs, Th/memory cells, and γδ T lymphocytes were previously reported to produce IFNγ during PRRSV infection. However, the proportion and phenotypic characterization of these IFNγ-secreting lymphocytes have not been explored. In this study, IFNγ producted by different lymphocyte subsets was assessed by multi-color flow cytometry after vaccination with PRRSV modified live vaccine (PRRSV-MLV) and challenge with homogeneous or heterogeneous PRRSV. The results showed that T-helper cells were the major IFNγ-secreting cell population after PRRSV-MLV vaccination and PRRSV challenge. Additionally, the proportion of IFNγ producing Th/memory cells and γδ T cells increased after PRRSV challenge. This difference was accounted for an enhanced ability to produce IFNγ in Th/memory cells and an enlarged quantity of γδ T cells. The results presented here could contribute to our understanding of the roles of IFNγ in protective immunity against PRRSV infection and may be useful for assessment of cell-mediated immunity in vaccine tests.",Swept source optical coherence tomography analysis of choroidal thickness in macular telangiectasia type 2: a case-control study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30560414,Graefe's archive for clinical and experimental ophthalmology = Albrecht von Graefes Archiv fur klinische und experimentelle Ophthalmologie,2019 04 10,There has been a recent interest in the association of macular telangiectasia (MacTel) type 2 with central serous choroidopathy and other pachychoroid disorders.

There is a significant heterogeneity in the side-effect profile of different CAR-T products under investigation and there is a need to develop standardized guidelines for toxicity grading and management. Here, we summarize the current literature on pathogenesis, clinical presentation, and management of CRS and neurotoxicity. The different grading systems of CRS and management protocols used in different trials have made it difficult to compare the outcomes of different CAR-T therapies.

In the present study, we have cloned a gene encoding laccase (poxa1b) from Pleurotus ostreatus and then heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli BL21. The biochemical properties of POXA1b were characterized using ABTS as a typical substrate of laccases. Moreover, the in vitro oxidation of the benzo[a]pyrene was investigated in the presence or absence of ABTS. The codon-optimized poxa1b showed higher expression yields and efficiency in comparison with the wild-type (p < 0.01). The maximum activity of POXA1b (2075 UL-1) was observed after incubation at 50 °C for 0.5 h and the enzyme retained more than 85% of its initial activity after 2 h incubation at 25-45 °C. The optimum pH of the enzyme was pH4 and the enzyme was stable when being incubated at pH range from 2.5 to 4.5 for 2 h in the absence of ABTS, the enzyme oxidized a little amount of benzo[a]pyrene, whereas its oxidation enhanced following the ABTS addition. These findings indicate POXA1b of P. ostreatus as a promising candidate for further biotechnological approaches.",Current genetic diversity in eight local Chinese sheep populations.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30560407,Molecular biology reports,2019 03 29,"China has numerous local domestic sheep breeds. In this study, the genetic diversity of eight sheep populations was estimated using 17 microsatellites. Knowledge of such diversity provides novel insight into the degree of breed protection needed and the prediction of hybrid advantage. In total, 17 microsatellites were genotyped in 186 individuals from eight populations. The mean number of alleles (± SD) ranged from 3.71 ± 1.36 in Zhaotong sheep to 11.94 ± 3.58 in small-tailed Han sheep. The observed heterozygote frequency (± SD) within a population ranged from 0.482 ± 0.025 in Zhaotong sheep to 0.664 ± 0.023 in Tibetan sheep. In addition, using pairwise difference (FST) analysis, the highest within-population diversity was observed in Tibetan sheep (πX = 12.8098) and small-tailed Han (πX = 12.67873), and the lowest diversity was observed in Zhaotong sheep (πX = 7.90337). The results for genetic divergence between populations indicated that the populations were significantly different (P < 0.05) based on the average number of pairwise differences between populations (πXY) and the corrected average pairwise differences. Both phylogenetic networks and structure analysis showed that these eight populations were separated into three clusters in accordance with their geographical habitat, except Tibetan and Hu sheep. In short, we genotyped eight local Chinese sheep populations using 17 microsatellites, and the results indicated that their current genetic diversity is decreasing and that new conservation strategies are needed. In addition, significant genetic differences between populations could be used in cross breeding.",Transcriptome-based gene expression profiling of diploid radish (Raphanus sativus L.) and the corresponding autotetraploid.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30560406,Molecular biology reports,2019 03 29,"Polyploidy is an important evolutionary factor in most land plant lineages which possess more than two complete sets of chromosomes. Radish (Raphanus sativus L.) is an economically annual/biennial root vegetable crop worldwide. However, the expression patterns of duplicated homologs involved in the autopolyploidization remains unclear. In present study, the autotetraploid radish plants (2n = 4x = 36) were produced with colchicine and exhibited an increase in the size of flowers, leaves, stomata and pollen grains. The differential gene expression (DGE) profiling was performed to investigate the differences in gene expression patterns between diploid and its corresponding autotetraploid by RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq). Totally, 483 up-regulated differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and 408 down-regulated DEGs were detected in diploid and autotetraploid radishes, which majorly involved in the pathways of hormones, photosynthesis and stress response. Moreover, the xyloglucan endotransglucosylase/hydrolase (XTH) and pectin methylesterases (PME) family members related to cell enlargement and cell wall construction were found to be enriched in GO enrichment analysis, of which XTH family members enriched in ""apoplast"" and ""cell wall"" terms, while PME family members enriched in ""cell wall"" term. Reverse-transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) analysis indicated that the expression profile of DEGs were consistent with results from the RNA-Seq analysis. The DEGs involved in cell wall construction and auxin metabolism were predicted to be associated with organs size increase of autotetraploid radishes in the present study. These results could provide valuable information for elucidating the molecular mechanism underlying polyploidization and facilitating further genetic improvements of important traits in radish breeding programs.","Informative combination of CLU rs11136000, serum HDL levels, diabetes, and age as a new piece of puzzle-picture of predictive medicine for cognitive disorders.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30560405,Molecular biology reports,2019 03 29,"Clusterin (CLU) is the third most important associated risk gene in cognitive disorders. Regarding the controversy about the association of CLU rs11136000 with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), the aim of this study was to investigate a putative association of CLU rs11136000 with MCI as well as the serum biological factors with a special attention to the age as a main dimension of a multifactorial elderly disease in an Iranian elderly cohort in which the mentioned association was not previously investigated. The study also checked the association between diabetes and MCI in this population. A population of 418 individuals containing 236 MCI and 192 control subjects was recruited from the Amirkola health and aging population cohort. Serum biological indexes were assessed by biochemical and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and rs11136000 genotyping was performed using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. Bioinformatics analyses were used to identify the putative effect of rs11136000 on the secondary structure of RNA and chromatin location in different cell lines and tissues. Type 2 diabetes was present with a higher proportion in the MCI group in comparison with the control group (P = 0.041). The frequency of the C allele of CLU rs11136000 was significantly different between cases and controls and was associated with MCI risk (OR 1.79, P = 0.019). Under a dominant genetic model, the CC genotype showed a predisposing effect in individuals aged ≥ 75 years (OR 3.33, P = 0.0004). Interestingly, under an over-dominant model, the CT genotype had a protective effect in this population (OR 4.52, P = < 0.0001). We also found a significant association between the genotypes and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels in MCI patients (P = 0.0004). Bioinformatics analysis showed that rs11136000 is located in the transcribed region without any regulatory features such as being enhancer or insulator. Also, the T>C transition of CLU rs11136000 could not cause significant mRNA folding (P = 0.950). Contrary to other studies on Asian populations, this study demonstrated an association between rs11136000 and MCI in an elderly Iranian population. This study also suggests that an age-dependent approach to the previous studies may be performed in order to revise the previous belief in this geographical area. The rs11136000 genotypes in combination with HDL levels and knowledge about diabetes background may be used as a predictive medicine tool for cognitive disorders.",Thoracic cage volume and dimension assessment by optoelectronic molding in normal children and adolescents during growth.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30560403,Surgical and radiologic anatomy : SRA,2019 04 01,"The thoracic spine, the chondral and osseous ribs, and the sternum together make up the thoracic cage.

This article focuses on some conceptual issues with HE that have important ethical implications. In particular it scrutinizes how the concept of human enhancement relates to and challenges the concept of health. In order to do so, it addresses three specific questions: Q1. What do conceptions of HE say about health? Q2. Does HE challenge traditional conceptions of health? Q3. Do concepts of health set limits to or direct HE? Addressing Q1 reveals that HE tends to frame and form our conception of health. Thereby it challenges traditional conceptions of health (Q2). Accordingly, health does not provide strong sources for setting limits to HE (Q3). On the contrary HE seems to define and expand the concept of health. Common to the concepts of HE and health is that both depend on vague value concepts, such as happiness, well-being, or goodness. There seems to be a tendency in the HE literature to define the goal of human life in terms of what is bigger, stronger, faster, more intelligent, and more resilient. However, this is confusing ""goodness"" with ""more"" and quality with quantity. Until HE more appropriately defines happiness, HE will fail to provide a relevant compass for improving the life of human beings. On the contrary, if we let simplified conceptions of ""enhancement"" come to define goodness or health, we may do more harm than good. Until doing so, we may well learn from Tithonus, listen to Douglas Adams' Wowbagger, and pay attention to Virginia Woolf's Orlando. Enhanced life may not be better. The same goes for health."

The goal of this research was to explore the influence of cellulosic polymers and incubation conditions on enhancement of solubility and dissolution of amorphous felodipine, while inhibiting crystallization of the drug from a supersaturated state. Variables, including cellulosic polymer type, amount, ionic strength, and viscosity, were evaluated for effects on API dissolution/solubility and crystallization processes. Water-soluble cellulosic polymers, including HPMC E15, HPMC E5, HPMC K100-LV, L-HPC, and MC, were studied. All cellulosic polymers could extend API dissolution and solubility to various extents by delaying crystallization and prolonging supersaturation duration, with their effectiveness ranked from greatest to least as HPMC E15 > HPMC E5 > HPMC K100-LV > L-HPC > MC. Decreased polymer amount, lower ionic strength, or higher polymer viscosity tended to decrease dissolution/solubility and promote crystal growth to accelerate crystallization. HPMC E15 achieved greatest extended API dissolution and maintenance of supersaturation from a supersaturated state; this polymer thus had the greatest potential for maintaining sustainable API absorption within biologically relevant time frames.",Impedimetric aptasensor for kanamycin by using carbon nanotubes modified with MoSe2 nanoflowers and gold nanoparticles as signal amplifiers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30560387,Mikrochimica acta,2019 01 25,"An aptamer based impedimetric method is described for the determination of kanamycin.

Long before his involvement in the mass murder programme, Heyde already contributed to the disastrous development in Germany with a positive psychiatric expert opinion on Theodor Eicke, who later became the Inspector of Concentration Camps (KZ) and head of the SS Death's Head Units. Furthermore, Heyde became an instructor of KZ physicians. This article focuses on Heyde's successful career at the University of Würzburg from 1926-1945, taking sources that confirm Heyde's homosexual propensities into account, suggesting a recurrent conflictual influence on his life.","[Letters from Paul Julius Möbius to Auguste-Henri Forel : ""…that the harmony of perceptions on this novel point is also repeated on completely different issues""].",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30560384,Der Nervenarzt,2019 05 12,"This article provides an analysis of the content of 15 letters and postcards written by the Leipzig neurologist Paul Julius Möbius to his Zurich-based colleague Auguste-Henri Forel between 1889 and 1902. Moreover, they are set in the context of the works of the two correspondence partners. The 15 documents preserved at the University of Zurich Medico-Historical Institute and Museum comprise one half of the correspondence, whereas the letters Forel sent in response do not seem to have been preserved. So far, biographic research has neglected the letters analyzed here. Hypnotism and medical suggestion as well as their effects and efficiency in treating and maybe healing certain nervous and mental disorders, primarily psychoneuroses but also certain somatic disorders, formed the bond that connected Möbius and Forel. The exchange was less concerned with discussing details or concepts of hypnosis. Möbius seemed to be more interested in studying the practical application with Forel. Moreover, Möbius and Forel shared the view that contemporary, largely brain-biologically oriented conventional psychiatry had largely neglected or at least underestimated the psychological component of both nervous and mental disorders. Both shared the notion that electrotherapy, widely used at the time, had a strong suggestive component. The letters revealed that both correspondents requested reviews or discussion of their own papers from each other. Forel invited Möbius to consider writing for his Zeitschrift für Hypnotismus (Journal for Hypnotism). The correspondence also revealed that their harmony in certain views did not prevent them from refusing requests made by the other. The letters discussed in this article enrich the knowledge on these two prominent neurologists of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.",Investigation of the Energy Band at the Molybdenum Disulfide and ZrO2 Heterojunctions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30560382,Nanoscale research letters,2019 01 08,"The energy band alignment at the multilayer-MoS2/ZrO2 interface and the effects of CHF3 plasma treatment on the band offset were explored using x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The valence band offset (VBO) and conduction band offset (CBO) for the MoS2 /ZrO2 sample is about 1.87 eV and 2.49 eV, respectively. While the VBO was enlarged by about 0.75 eV for the sample with CHF3 plasma treatment, which is attributed to the up-shift of Zr 3d core level. The calculation results demonstrated that F atoms have strong interactions with Zr atoms, and the valence band energy shift for the d-orbital of Zr atoms is about 0.76 eV, in consistent with the experimental result. This interesting finding encourages the application of ZrO2 as gate materials in MoS2-based electronic devices and provides a promising way to adjust the band alignment.",Transaxillary transcatheter aortic valve implantation utilizing a novel vascular closure device with resorbable collagen material: a feasibility study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30560381,Clinical research in cardiology : official journal of the German Cardiac Society,2018 12 18,We herein aimed to evaluate technical feasibility of transaxillary (Tax) transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) utilizing a novel vascular closure device with a resorbable collagen plug and absence of suture material.,Histopathologic changes inside the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve obtained from patients with persistent symptoms of meralgia paresthetica.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30560377,Acta neurochirurgica,2019 02 13,"In patients with persistent symptoms of meralgia paresthetica, a neurectomy of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve (LFCN) can be performed to alleviate pain symptoms.

Particularly, GRP78 can be secreted into microenvironment by tumor cells through the pathway of exosome, which promotes proliferation, angiogenesis, and drug resistance in cancer cells. Hence, we discovered a potential inhibitor to block GRP78 secretion. We screened five small molecules that may interact with the GRP78 from 51 traditional Chinese medicine molecules by molecular docking. By using western blot, we found that one of the molecules can inhibit the secretion of GRP78, which is salvianolic acid A (SAA). Further, SAA could interact with the lysine residue 633 (K633) of GRP78, which inhibited GRP78 secretion. Moreover, SAA-GRP78 interaction can facilitate GRP78 of cytosol sorted into lysosome for degradation rather than exosome. In conclusion, our research revealed that SAA has the novel function of anti-angiogenesis via the tumor environment.",Totally robotic modified complete mesocolic excision and central vascular ligation for right-sided colon cancer: technical feasibility and mid-term oncologic outcomes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30560354,International journal of colorectal disease,2019 04 08,"Recently, an operative strategy involving complete mesocolic excision (CME) and central vascular ligation (CVL) for colonic cancer has been introduced.

Hepatitis C-seropositive liver grafts have been used primarily in hepatitis C-positive recipients, with studies showing non-inferior outcomes when compared to hepatitis C-negative grafts. Studies suggest that hepatitis C serology status of the donor liver does not influence the patient or graft outcomes in the recipient. These results advocate for offering hepatitis C-positive grafts to all patients awaiting liver transplantation regardless of their hepatitis C status. However, some concerns persist regarding the ethics of potentially introducing a new infection into a patient that could progress to chronic liver disease following liver transplantation.

Muir-Torre syndrome (MTS) is considered a phenotypical variant of LS, where patients develop sebaceous neoplasms and keratoacanthomas. Currently, only few studies and case reports suggest an association between LS and other skin cancers, such as Bowens' disease, melanoma and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). In this case-report we describe the case of a 33-year-old woman with LS and a proven MSH2 germline mutation, presenting with a SCC on the right cheek. Immunohistochemistry lacked MSH2 and MSH6 protein staining.

They display blue fluorescence (with excitation/emission peaks at 380/460 nm and a 33% quantum yield) and possess high dispersity in aqueous solution. The fluorescence of the Mg,N-CDs is highly sensitive to paraoxon in the presence of pralidoxime (PAM) acting as the linking agent. Electron transfer from Mg,N-CDs to paraoxon in the presence of PAM leads to the fluorescence quenching of Mg,N-CDs. The concentration of paraoxon is determined by measuring the quenching efficiency of the Mg,N-CD-PAM assay system. Fluorescence drops with increasing concentrations of paraoxon in the 0.005-3.0 μM range, and the limit of detection is 0.87 nM. The method is highly selective for paraoxon even in the presence of possible interferences. Real sample study of tap and river water showed the assay to have good repeatability and accuracy.

Multiple electrodes must be implanted to construct a feedback control loop, including one electrode for acquisition and another for stimulation. Existing approaches require too much space inside the body and a complicated surgical procedure. This paper proposes a novel neural interface method that uses a single cuff electrode with multichannel capability to simultaneously acquire multichannel recordings and induce electrical stimulation at the proximal nerve trunk of the sciatic nerve. Recordings and stimulation are conducted in a time-shared manner using a path controller. Using the proposed method, joint positions are estimated from multichannel recorded neural signals during electrical stimulation as neural signals are continuously recorded. In addition, the proposed system is shown to be suitable for controlling joint position. The proposed neural interface method overcomes the spatial limitations of electrode implantation and thus offers a new approach to developing compact neural interface systems.",Evaluation of Strontium-Containing PCL-PDIPF Scaffolds for Bone Tissue Engineering: In Vitro and In Vivo Studies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30560305,Annals of biomedical engineering,2019 02 20,"Bone tissue engineering (BTE) has the general objective of restoring and improving damaged bone. A very interesting strategy for BTE is to combine an adequate polymeric scaffold with an osteoinductive compound. Strontium is a divalent cation that can substitute calcium in hydroxyapatite and induce both anabolic and anti-catabolic effects in bone. On the other hand, systemic increases in Sr2+ levels can provoke adverse cardiovascular effects. In the present study we have developed a compatibilized blend of poly-ε-caprolactone (PCL) and polydiisopropyl fumarate (PDIPF) enriched with 1% or 5% Sr2+ and evaluated the applicability of these biomaterials for BTE, both in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, whereas Blend + 5% Sr2+ was pro-inflammatory and anti-osteogenic, Blend + 1% Sr2+ released very low quantities of the cation; was not cytotoxic for cultured macrophages; and showed improved osteocompatibility when used as a substratum for primary cultures of bone marrow stromal cells. In vivo, implants with Blend + 1% Sr2+ significantly increased bone tissue regeneration and improved fibrous bridging (vs. Blend alone), while neither inducing a local inflammatory response nor increased serum levels of Sr2+. These results indicate that our compatibilized blend of PCL-PDIPF enriched with 1% Sr2+ could be useful for BTE.",Solubility Prediction of Drugs in Binary Solvent Mixtures at Various Temperatures Using a Minimum Number of Experimental Data Points.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30560304,AAPS PharmSciTech,2019 02 15,"This study aimed to provide a rational experimental design to collect a minimum number of experimental data points for a drug dissolved in a given binary solvent mixture at various temperatures, and to describe a computational procedure to predict the solubility of the drugs in any solvent composition and temperature of interest. We gathered available solubility data sets from papers published from 2012 to 2016 (56 data sets, 3488 data points totally). The mean percentage deviations (MPD) used to check the accuracy of predictions was calculated by Eq. 10. Fifty-six datasets were analyzed using 8 training data points which the overall MPD was calculated to be 15.5% ± 15.1%, and for 52 datasets after excluding 5 outlier sets was 12.1% ± 8.9%. The paired t test was conducted to compare the MPD values obtained from the models trained by 7 and 8 training data points and the reduction in prediction overall MPD (from 17.7% to 15.5%) was statistically significant (p < 0.04). To further reduction in MPD values, the computations were also conducted using 9 training data points, which did not reveal any significant difference comparing to the predictions using 8 training data points (p > 0.88). This observation revealed that the model adequately trained using 8 data points and could be used as a practical strategy for predicting the solubility of drugs in binary solvent mixtures at various temperatures with acceptable prediction error and using minimum experimental efforts.

The extended measuring range compared to previous systems as well as the microwave moisture values independent of other physical attributes make them promising process analytical technology (PAT) tools for various pharmaceutical production processes. However, so far, research focused on measurements on raw materials or drug-free model granulates and has neither evaluated the applicability for materials with crystal water containing excipients nor for active ingredients. In this study, possible influence of crystal water was evaluated using lactose monohydrate and donepezil hydrochloride, an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) against dementia. The study clearly showed that the contained hydrate does not cause interferences and is not monitored by the applied frequencies. Material-related limits measuring lactose monohydrate were only observed above typical granulation moistures and could be explained using raw resonance curves. Furthermore, the inclusion of donepezil hydrochloride into the monitored formulations and varied process parameters demonstrated the versatility of the microwave resonance sensor system. Inlet air temperature, spraying rate, and air flow were varied according to a 23 full factorial experimental design. A predictive model (R2 = 0.9699, RMSEC = 0.33%) could be established using samples produced with different process parameter settings adjusted according to the corner points of the full factorial design and validated on the center point granulation processes (RMSEV = 0.38%).

Here, we present an optimized low-temperature preparation method for the histological processing of un-/cellularized thermosensitive PCL/PLA scaffolds.Our study is aimed at the establishment of an optimized dehydration and low-melting-point paraffin-embedding method of electrospun PCL/PLA scaffolds (un-/cellularized). Furthermore, we compared this method with (a) automatized dehydration and standard paraffin embedding, (b) gelatin embedding followed by automatized dehydration and standard paraffin embedding, (c) cryofixation, and (d) acrylic resin embedding methods. We investigated pepsin and proteinase K antigen retrieval for their efficiency in epitope demasking at low temperatures and evaluated protocols for immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence for cytokeratin 7 (CK7) and in situ padlock probe technology for beta actin (ACTB). Optimized dehydration and low-melting-point paraffin embedding preserved the PCL/PLA scaffold, as the diameter and structure of its fibers were unchanged. Cells attached to the PCL/PLA scaffolds showed limited alterations in size and morphology compared to control. Epitope demasking by enzymatic pepsin digestion and immunostaining of CK7 displayed an invasion of attached cells into the scaffold. Expression of ACTB and CK7 was shown by a combination of mRNA-based in situ padlock probe technology and immunofluorescence. In contrast, gelatin stabilization followed by standard paraffin embedding led to an overall shrinkage and melting of fibers, and therefore, no further analysis was possible. Acrylic resin embedding and cyrofixation caused fiber structures that were nearly unchanged in size and diameter. However, acrylic resin-embedded scaffolds are limited to 3 µm sections, whereas cyrofixation led to a reduction of the cell size by 14% compared to low-melting paraffin embedding. The combination of low-melting-point paraffin embedding and pepsin digestion as an antigen retrieval method offers a successful opportunity for histological investigations in thermosensitive specimens.","Sphingobium aromaticivastans sp. nov., a novel aniline- and benzene-degrading, and antimicrobial compound producing bacterium.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30560286,Archives of microbiology,2019 03 07,"A strictly aerobic, orange-pigmented strain was isolated and designated as UCM-25T.

Emerging evidence revealed that the transient deficiency of Klotho is an early event of acute kidney injury (AKI), whereas, in chronic kidney disease, this deficiency is sustained not only in the kidney, but also in other organ systems. Therefore, Klotho could be a potential biomarker for early diagnosis of AKI, as well as for its progression to chronic kidney disease. Moreover, Klotho might have therapeutic value to renal injury. Nevertheless, there are only few studies on the involvement of Klotho in post AKI repair. This review focused on the role of Klotho in not only kidney injury, but also its repair, in particular the relationship between Klotho and cell fate (autophagy/apoptosis/necrosis), repair/regeneration, Wnt/β-catenin and erythropoietin receptor, one of the Klotho effectors."

Copper oxide nanoparticles (CuO NPs) are one example of nanomaterials used in a wide range of consumer products due to their conductivity and biocidal properties. While CuO NPs can induce toxicity in various organisms, their interactions with different organisms and how they affect cellular homeostasis is yet to be fully understood. In this work, the toxicity of CuO NPs was evaluated in different human cell lines (colorectal carcinoma, cervical cancer, embryonic kidney, and lung fibroblast), showing a dose-dependent toxicity. An untargeted lipidomics approach using liquid chromatography-quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry was employed in a human colon carcinoma cell line to investigate the impact of CuO NP exposure at the cellular level. A 24 h CuO NP exposure at 2.5 and 5 μg mL-1 resulted in upregulation of different metabolites: triacylglycerols, phosphatidylcholines, and ceramides accumulated. The most profound increase in a dose-dependent manner was observed in ceramides, specifically in C18:0, C18:1, and C22:0 species, with up to ∼10 fold accumulations. Further experiments suggested that activation of autophagy and oxidative stress could be responsible for the toxicity observed in these cell lines. Increases in the level of glutathione oxide (∼7 fold) also supported the activation of oxidative stress upon CuO NP treatment. Based on the changes in different metabolites induced by CuO NP exposure and previous studies from our laboratory, we propose that autophagy and oxidative stress could play a role in CuO NP-induced toxicity.","Impact of morphology, side-chains, and crystallinity on charge-transport properties of π-extended double helicenes.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30560256,Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP,2019 01 08,"We report a computational study on the effect of side-chain substitution, heteroaromatic substitution and unique crystal packing on the charge transport and mobility of three double helicene molecules. These double helicene (DH) molecules, having curved π-conjugation, are structural hybrids of non-planar [6]helicene and planar tribenzo[b,n,pqr]perylene (TBP). We find that side-chain substitution has only a effect on intrinsic electronic properties in DHs but dramatically impacts the packing arrangement, morphologies and transport network, exhibited in calculated charge transport parameters. Interestingly, the dimensionality of the transport evolves from one dimensional to three dimensional with side-chain substitution (DH2) and heteroaromatic substitution (DH3). Using two different well-known transport models, we have established a direct link between the morphology, transport connectivity, and hole mobilities. While both unsubstituted and substituted DHs exhibit high hole mobilities in the ordered phase, the results show that with inclusion of positional disorder, the mobilities of disordered DH1 and DH3 are lower while the mobility of DH2 remain nearly unchanged. We relate this effect to the dimensionality of their unique transport networks. These DH molecules are promising organic semiconductors with high mobilities in ordered and disordered phases, with predicted values that lie in the range of ∼1 to 10 cm2 V-1 s-1.","Polynuclear Cu(i) and Ag(i) phosphine complexes containing multi-dentate polytopic ligands: syntheses, crystal structures and photoluminescence properties.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30560254,"Dalton transactions (Cambridge, England : 2003)",2019 01 03,"A series of polynuclear metal complexes, [Cu2(L1)(PPh3)4](ClO4)2 (1), [Cu3(L2)(PPh3)6](ClO4) (2), [Cu3(L3)(PPh3)6] (3), [Ag2(L1)(PPh3)4](BF4)2 (4), [Ag4(L2)2(PPh3)6] (5) and [Ag3(L3)(PPh3)5] (6), have been obtained from the reactions of the highly conjugated bridging ligands 2,3-bis(2-pyridyl)pyrazine (L1), 2,3-bis(2-tetrazoyl)pyrazine (H2L2) and 2,3-bis(2-tetrazoyl)imidazole (H3L3) with [Cu(MeCN)4]ClO4 and AgBF4, respectively.

SIM is based on lateral illumination by arrays of discrete color RGB light emitting diodes (LEDs) of spectrally adjusted plasmonic NPs and consecutive detection by the conventional CMOS color camera. We demonstrate the enhanced contrast and higher resolution of our method for individual NP detection in the liquid medium and of NP markers attached on the cell membrane in a cytology preparation by comparing it to the conventional darkfield microscopy (DFM).

One of the chief culprits is the overexpression of glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) in cancer cells, which can accelerate the interaction of glutathione (GSH) with cisplatin, reducing its biological effects. In this study, three Pt(iv) complexes derived from cisplatin conjugated with a GST inhibitor (NBDHEX) were designed and synthesized. The stabilities and releasing capabilities of these complexes, as well as their abilities to inhibit GSTs, were investigated together with their in vitro anticancer activities toward osteosarcoma cells. Among them, complex 2, bearing one NBDHEX derivative and a hydroxyl group at the axial positions, could markedly kill human OS cells due to its suitable stability and prominent ability to inhibit GSTs. Meanwhile, it can prevent the metastasis of OS via down-regulating Akt.

A substantial part of the genome encompasses repeats and when such repeats are in the coding region they may lead to change in the gene expression profile followed by pathological conditions. Structural variants are alterations which change one or more sequence feature in the chromosome such as change in the copy number, rearrangements, and translocations of a sequence and can be balanced or unbalanced. Copy number variants (CNVs) may increase or decrease the copies of a given region and have a pivotal role in the onset of many diseases including cardiovascular disorders. Cardiovascular disorders have a magnitude of well-established risk factors and etiology, but their correlation with CNVs is still being studied. In this article, we have discussed history of CNVs and a summary on the diseases associated with CNVs. To detect such variations, we shed light on the number of techniques introduced so far and their limitations. The lack of studies on cardiovascular diseases to determine the frequency of such variants needs clinical studies with larger cohorts.

The human cornea is arranged into well-organized layers, and each layer plays a significant role in maintaining the transparency and viability of the tissue. The endothelium has both barrier and pump functions, which are important for the maintenance of corneal clarity. Many etiologies, including Fuchs' endothelial corneal dystrophy, surgical trauma, and congenital hereditary endothelial dystrophy, lead to endothelial cell dysfunction. The main treatment for corneal decompensation is replacement of the abnormal corneal layers with normal donor tissue. Nowadays, the trend is to perform selective endothelial keratoplasty, including Descemet stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty and Descemet's membrane endothelial keratoplasty, to manage corneal endothelial dysfunction. This selective approach has several advantages over penetrating keratoplasty, including rapid recovery of visual acuity, less likelihood of graft rejection, and better patient satisfaction. However, the global limitation in the supply of donor corneas is becoming an increasing challenge, necessitating alternatives to reduce this demand. Consequently, in vitro expansion of human corneal endothelial cells is evolving as a sustainable choice. This method is intended to prepare corneal endothelial cells in vitro that can be transferred to the eye.

Nearly all U.S. states have enacted policies targeting alcohol use during pregnancy, but there has been little research examining their impact, particularly across racial/ethnic groups. Methods: Using data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System and about eight state-level, pregnancy-specific alcohol policies from 1985 to 2016, the aim of this study was to examine the differential effects of these policies on drinking among pregnant women by race/ethnicity. Results: We found evidence of differential effects for priority treatment, prohibitions on criminal prosecution, and civil commitment policies.

Inulin, in spite of the effects and nutritional benefits, will also have undesirable effects on the quality and shelf life of bread. In this study, the interactions between polyols as improvers (i.e. glycerol, sorbitol and propylene glycol) and major biopolymers of wheat flour (i.e. starch and gluten) were examined in model systems fortified with Serish inulin by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The changes in starch structure were estimated focusing on the ratios of the heights of the bands at 1047 and 1022 cm-1 which expresses the quantity of ordered starch to amorphous starch. At first and 5th days of storage, this ratio of control sample was higher than polyol treated samples. It was proved from Gaussian-Lorenzian curve fitting that the relative contribution of characteristic peaks of β-turns and intramolecular β-sheets was consecutively increased when polyol proportion of models increased. Whereas, content of intermolecular β-sheets and α-helix was slightly decreased with increasing of polyols in the models. Briefly, polyols especially 5% propylene glycol, could be used to reduce the undesirable effects of inulin on the quality parameters of dough and bread.",Bioglass functionalization of laser-patterned bioceramic surfaces and their enhanced bioactivity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30560211,Heliyon,2018 12 20,"The surfaces of silicon nitride (β-Si3N4) and zirconia toughened alumina (ZTA) were patterned using a high-energy laser source, which operated at a wavelength of 1064 nm. The patterning procedure yielded a series regular, cylindrical cavities 500 and 300 μm in diameter and depth, respectively. These cavities were subsequently filled with bioglass mixed with different fractions of Si3N4 powder (0, 5, and 10 mol.%) to obtain bioactive functionalized bioceramic surfaces. The laser-patterned samples were first characterized using several spectroscopic techniques before and after functionalization, and then tested in vitro with respect to their osteoconductivity using a human osteosarcoma cell line (SaOS-2). After in vitro testing, fluorescence microscopy was used to address the biological response and to estimate osteopontin and osteocalcin protein contents and distributions. The presence of bioglass greatly enhanced the biological response of both ceramic surfaces, but mainly induced production of inorganic apatite. On the other hand, the addition of minor fraction of Si3N4 into the bioglass-filled holes greatly enhanced bio-mineralization and stimulated the SaOS-2 cells to produce higher amounts of bone extracellular matrix (collagen and proteins), thus enhancing the osteopontin to osteocalcin ratio. It was also observed that the presence of a fraction of Si3N4 in the powder mixture filling the holes bestowed more uniform cell colonization on the otherwise bioinert ZTA surface.",Phytochemical screening and inhibitory activity of oxalocalcic crystallization of Arbutus unedo L. leaves.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30560210,Heliyon,2018 12 20,"The present study is focused on the experimental verification of the efficiency of Arbutus unedo L. leaves against the crystallization of calcium oxalate. The inhibition of crystallization has been studied in vitro with the absence and the presence of the different concentrations of the infusion and hydroalcoholic extract of the plant. This study consists of measuring, using a UV-Visible spectrophotometer, the temporal evolution of the optical density at λ = 620 nm corresponding to the crystals formation. The latter have been characterized by microscopic observation using an optical microscope, and by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR). The results suggest a greater effectiveness of the plant infusion with respect to the hydroalcoholic extract against crystallization or nucleation at percentages of 69.41 ± 0.24 or 19.76 ± 0.27% and at 93.92 ± 2.61 and 45.16 ± 3.06% against the aggregation, for both the infusion and the hydroalcoholic extract respectively.

High-profile scandals of sexual harassment and gender pay differences have focused attention on the on-going disparity between sexes and political status. This paper presents a novel experiment in the application of so-called ""big data"" to analyse gender inequality. Using Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques in the form of Natural Language Processing, a web crawler is used to audit the whole.uk online domain, and to measure the United Kingdom's (UK's) online economic presence for gender representation in terms of: prominence, job roles, and leadership within and across economic sectors. The procedure scans over 200 million web pages, and harvests 157,032 organisations and over 2.3 million people. The results reveal material bias (60%+) towards the representation of men over the majority of economic sectors, and across representation of power and status within job roles and professional titles. The experiment highlights not only new levels of gender bias but also the use of the Internet as a valuable source of plentiful data for social and economic analysis.",Engineering and modification of microbial chassis for systems and synthetic biology.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30560208,Synthetic and systems biotechnology,2019 02 20,"Engineering and modifying synthetic microbial chassis is one of the best ways not only to unravel the fundamental principles of life but also to enhance applications in the health, medicine, agricultural, veterinary, and food industries. The two primary strategies for constructing a microbial chassis are the top-down approach (genome reduction) and the bottom-up approach (genome synthesis). Research programs on this topic have been funded in several countries. The 'Minimum genome factory' (MGF) project was launched in 2001 in Japan with the goal of constructing microorganisms with smaller genomes for industrial use. One of the best examples of the results of this project is E. coli MGF-01, which has a reduced-genome size and exhibits better growth and higher threonine production characteristics than the parental strain [1]. The 'cell factory' project was carried out from 1998 to 2002 in the Fifth Framework Program of the EU (European Union), which tried to comprehensively understand microorganisms used in the application field. One of the outstanding results of this project was the elucidation of proteins secreted by Bacillus subtilis, which was summarized as the 'secretome' [2]. The GTL (Genomes to Life) program began in 2002 in the United States. In this program, researchers aimed to create artificial cells both in silico and in vitro, such as the successful design and synthesis of a minimal bacterial genome by John Craig Venter's group [3]. This review provides an update on recent advances in engineering, modification and application of synthetic microbial chassis, with particular emphasis on the value of learning about chassis as a way to better understand life and improve applications.",Characterization of the positive SARP family regulator PieR for improving piericidin A1 production in Streptomyces piomogeues var. Hangzhouwanensis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30560207,Synthetic and systems biotechnology,2018 12 20,"Piericidin A1, a member of ɑ-pyridone antibiotic, exhibits various biological activities such as antimicrobial, antifungal, and antitumor properties and possesses potent respiration-inhibitory activity against insects due to its competitive binding capacity to mitochondrial complex I. The biosynthetic pathway of piericidin A1 has been reported in Streptomyces piomogeues var. Hangzhouwanensis, while the regulatory mechanism remains poorly understood. In this study, a Streptomyces antibiotic regulatory protein (SARP) family transcriptional regulator PieR was characterized. Genetic disruption and complementation manipulations revealed that PieR positively regulated the production of piericidin A1. Moreover, the overexpression of pieR contributed to the improvement of piericidin A1 productivity. The real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) was carried out and the data showed that pieR stimulated the transcription of all the biosynthesis-related genes for piericidin A1. In order to explore the regulatory mechanism, electrophoresis mobility shift assays (EMSA) and DNase I footprinting experiments have been conducted. A protected region covering 50 nucleotides within the upstream region of pieR was identified and two 5-nt direct repeat sequences (5'-CCGGA-3') in the protected region were found. These findings, taken together, set stage for transcriptional control engineering in the view of optimizing piericidin A1 production and thus provide a viable potent route for the construction of strains with high productivity.",Troublesome reproduction: surrogacy under scrutiny.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30560206,Reproductive biomedicine & society online,2019 05 02,"In recent years, the emergence of transnational commercial surrogacy arrangements has prompted consideration of how and whether it is possible to bridge claims for reproductive rights from involuntarily childless couples and singles, many of whom historically have been excluded from reproduction, with the rights and well-being of the reproductive assisters. In this article, I suggest that a fruitful starting point for a conversation on how to tackle such a challenge is to examine the way in which surrogacy is conceptualized. Thus, I examine how scholars have queried surrogacy, asking how different conceptualizations of who this reproductive phenomenon concerns have led to the formulations of different types of 'troubles' of surrogacy. I delineate three different conceptualizations of surrogacy. Firstly, how surrogacy as a way to make parents has troubled scholars because of the conflation of reproduction with consumption, thereby making reproduction a matter of financial resource. Secondly, the trouble emerging when surrogacy is conceptualized as baby-making relates to how surrogacy turns babies and bodies into commodities. Thirdly, surrogacy understood as a phenomenon that concerns the women gestating and birthing the children has brought attention to issues of exploitation. These different formulations of trouble point towards tensions in the literature, while also offering reminders that surrogacy is not one thing alone; a finding that provides an opening for new forms of reproductive justice. This brings me to propose a rethinking of the notion of 'reproductive assistance', arguing in favour of moving away from substitution and transaction towards a relational being-together.",360-degree suture trabeculotomy ab interno with phacoemulsification in open-angle glaucoma and coexisting cataract: a pilot study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30560205,BMJ open ophthalmology,2018 12 20,We performed a pilot trial to evaluate the 24-month safety and efficacy of 360-degree suture trabeculotomy ab interno with phacoemulsification used to treat mild to moderate open-angle glaucoma coexisting with cataract.,Designing Shared Decision-Making Interventions for Dissemination and Sustainment: Can Implementation Science Help Translate Shared Decision Making Into Routine Practice?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30560204,MDM policy & practice,2018 12 20,"Shared decision making (SDM) is not widely practiced in routine care due to a variety of organizational, provider, patient, and contextual factors. This article explores how implementation science-which encourages attention to the multilevel contextual factors that influence the adoption, implementation, and sustainment of health care practices-can provide useful insights for increasing SDM use in routine practice. We engaged with stakeholders representing different organizations and geographic locations over three phases: 1) multidisciplinary workgroup meeting comprising researchers and clinicians (n = 11); 2) survey among a purposive sample of 47 patient advocates, clinicians, health care system leaders, funders, policymakers, and researchers; and 3) working session among diverse stakeholders (n = 30). The workgroup meeting identified priorities for action and research, which included targeting multiple audiences and levels, shifting culture toward valuing and supporting SDM, and considering contextual factors influencing SDM implementation. Survey respondents provided recommendations for increasing adoption, implementation, and maintenance of SDM in practice including providing tools to support SDM, obtaining stakeholders' involvement, and raising awareness of the importance of SDM. Stakeholders in the working session provided recommendations on the design of a guide for implementation of SDM in clinical settings, strategies to disseminate educational curricula on SDM, and strategies to influence policies to increase SDM use. These specific recommendations serve as a call to action to pursuing specific promising strategies aimed at increasing SDM use in practice and enhance understanding of the perspectives of diverse stakeholders at multiple levels from an implementation science perspective that appear fruitful for further study and application.",LOTUS Inhibits Neuronal Apoptosis and Promotes Tract Regeneration in Contusive Spinal Cord Injury Model Mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30560203,eNeuro,2019 04 19,"Nogo receptor-1 (NgR1) signaling is involved in the limitation of axonal regeneration following spinal cord injury (SCI) through collapsing the growth cone and inhibiting neurite outgrowth. Lateral olfactory tract usher substance (LOTUS), a NgR antagonist, suppresses these pathological conditions. A previous report demonstrated the positive effects of LOTUS expression on motor function through raphespinal tract regeneration using pan-neuronally LOTUS-overexpressing transgenic mice. However, this report used a hemi-section model, which does not represent the majority of clinical SCI cases, and lacked a detailed histological analysis of other descending tracts. To determine the true therapeutic effects of LOTUS, we used a more clinically relevant contusive SCI model in female transgenic mice. Definitive tracing analyses revealed that LOTUS promoted the extensive regeneration of the reticulospinal tract across the lesion site and suppressed axonal dieback of corticospinal tract (CST). A significant increase in raphespinal tract fibers was seen from the subacute to the chronic phase after the injury, strongly suggesting that LOTUS promoted translesional elongation of this tract. Furthermore, histological analyses revealed that LOTUS had a neuroprotective effect on the injured spinal cord through suppressing cellular apoptosis during the acute phase. These neuroprotective and regenerative effects contributed to significant motor functional recovery and restoration of the motor evoked potential (MEP). Therefore, LOTUS application could prove beneficial in the treatment of SCI by promoting axonal regeneration of some descending fibers, reducing axonal dieback of CST fibers and encouraging motor function recovery."

In northern boreal ecosystems, paludification is defined as the accumulation of partially decomposed organic matter over saturated mineral soils, a process that reduces tree regeneration and forest growth. Given this negative effect on forest productivity, spatial prediction of paludification in black spruce stands is important in forest management. This paper provides a description of the soil database to predict organic layer thickness (OLT) as a proxy of paludification in northeastern Canada. The database contains 13,944 OLT measurements (in cm) and their respective GPS coordinates. We collected OLT measurements from georeferenced ground plots and transects from several previous projects. Despite the variety of sources, the sampling design for each dataset was similar, consisting of manual measurements of OLT with a hand probe. OLT measurements were variable across the study area, with a mean ± standard deviation of 21 ± 24 cm (ranging from a minimum of 0 cm to a maximum of 150 cm), and the distribution tended toward positive skewing, with a large number of low OLT values and fewer high OLT values. The dataset has been used to perform OLT mapping at 30-m resolution and predict the risk of paludification in northeastern Canada (Mansuy et al., 2018) [1].

We used a retrospective cohort study design based on 2 data sources from 2007 to 2011 (the Bureau of National Health Insurance, Department of Health, Taiwan, and a local teaching children's hospital database) and descriptive statistics to analyze the group's age and gender differences as independent variables. Results. The gender ratio was 7 males to 1 female in the general population, whereas the gender ratio in children was 3.5 males to 1 female. Gender difference was found statistically significant in the age subgroup difference: boys (49.1%) were more than girls (39.3%) in ages 1 to 4, while girls (37.8%) were more than boys (23.7%) in ages 5 to 9. Based on the local hospital's data, of those 611 (15%) children born and who received herniorrhaphy, 204 (33.4%) were born as preterm infants and 407 (66.6%) as term infants. The gender ratio among 204 children born prematurely and received herniorrhaphy was 3 males to 1 female.

The Giant Geriatric Syndromes (Geriatric Giants) have been qualified by the original Nascher's criteria defined more than 100 years ago, but they are becoming more and more relevant in connection with the aging of societies. The criteria comprise the older age, commonness of the health problem, multifactorial etiology, functional or cognitive impairment, worsened outcome, and increased morbidity and mortality. We described the impact of diabetes on Geriatric Giants including cognitive dysfunction, depression, malnutrition, incontinence, falls and fractures, chronic pain, and the loss of senses. The association of diabetes with Geriatric Giants reveals as a vicious circle with the background of neurovascular complications. However, diabetes influence on the incidence of cancer in elderly was also discussed, since neoplastic diseases associate with Geriatric Giants, for example, chronic pain and depression.

Recent literature has incorporated language-based modelling, which uses previously chosen characters and the structure of natural language to modify the interface and classifier. Two complementary methods of incorporating language models have previously been independently studied: predictive spelling uses language models to generate suggestions of complete words to allow for the selection of multiple characters simultaneously, and language model-based classifiers have used prior characters to create a prior probability distribution over the characters based on how likely they are to follow. In this study, we propose a combined method which extends a language-based classifier to generate prior probabilities for both individual characters and complete words. In order to gauge the efficiency of this new model, results across 12 healthy subjects were measured. Incorporating predictive spelling increased typing speed using the P300 speller, with an average increase of 15.5% in typing rate across subjects, demonstrating that language models can be effectively utilized to create full word suggestions for predictive spelling. When combining predictive spelling with language model classification, typing speed is significantly improved, resulting in better typing performance.","Short-Term Outcomes of Concussions in Major League Baseball: A Historical Cohort Study of Return to Play, Performance, Longevity, and Financial Impact.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30560144,Orthopaedic journal of sports medicine,2018 12 20,"The short-term outcomes of concussions within Major League Baseball (MLB) warrant further consideration beyond a medical standpoint given that performance, career, and financial data remain unknown.

Repeated suberythemogenic doses of UV-light reduce inflammation in these diseases and ultimately may lead to a complete disappearance of cutaneous symptoms for weeks or months. Chronic pruritus is an important and highly distressing symptom of many of these inflammatory skin diseases. Interestingly, pruritus is also reduced or completely abolished by UV-treatment of psoriasis and atopic dermatitis, and sometimes reduction of pruritus is the first indication for skin improvement by phototherapy. The cutaneous nervous system is an integral part of skin anatomy, and free nerve endings of sensory cutaneous nerve fibers reach up into the epidermis getting in close contact with epidermal cells and mediators from epidermal cells released into the intercellular space. Stimulation of ""pruriceptors"" within this group of sensory nerve fibers generates a neuronal signal eventually transmitted via the dorsal root and the spinal cord to the brain, where it is recognized as ""itch"". UV-light may directly affect cutaneous sensory nerve fibers or, via the release of mediators from cells within the skin, indirectly modulate their function as well as the transmission of itch to the central nervous system inducing the clinically recognized antipruritic effect of phototherapy.",Diagnostic Accuracy of Different Soluble fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 1 and Placental Growth Factor Cut-Off Values in the Assessment of Preterm and Term Preeclampsia: A Gestational Age Matched Case-Control Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30560128,Frontiers in medicine,2018 12 20,"Introduction: The objective was to investigate the diagnostic accuracy of different thresholds of the soluble vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-1 (sFlt-1) and the placental growth factor (PlGF) in preterm (≤37 weeks) and term (>37 weeks) preeclampsia (PE). Materials and Methods: A nested case-control study was performed from a high-risk Swiss cohort. Only blood samples on the day of PE diagnosis were included. The primary outcome was to verify the diagnosis using the recently proposed cut-off values for PE (sFlt-1:PlGF ratio of ≥85 in ≤ 34 weeks or ≥110 in >34 weeks), and the gestational age dependent centiles. Results: Thirty-four women with preterm PE were matched with 64 controls and 25 women with term PE with 45 controls. The test performance of the sFlt-1:PlGF ratio in preterm PE was very good (AUROCC of 0.95). The sFlt-1:PlGF ratio could adequately predict adverse fetal or neonatal outcome. In term PE, sFlt-1 alone showed a slightly better diagnostic accuracy with an AUROCC of 0.84. Almost all women with a sFlt-1:PlGF ratio above threshold delivered during the following week. Discussion: In pregnant women with high risk of developing PE, the sFlt-1:PlGF ratio and sFlt-1 levels help clinicians to confirm the diagnosis of imminent preterm PE and can additionally be used to rule out PE at term.",Determining Fractional Urate Excretion Rates in Hyponatremic Conditions and Improved Methods to Distinguish Cerebral/Renal Salt Wasting From the Syndrome of Inappropriate Secretion of Antidiuretic Hormone.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30560127,Frontiers in medicine,2018 12 20,"Our evaluation of hyponatremic patients is in a state of confusion because the assessment of the volume status of the patient and determinations of urine sodium concentrations (UNa) >30-40 mEq/L have dominated our approach despite documented evidence of many shortcomings. Central to this confusion is our inability to differentiate cerebral/renal salt wasting (C/RSW) from the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH), syndromes with diametrically opposing therapeutic goals. The recent proposal to treat most or all hyponatremic patients makes differentiation even more important and reports of C/RSW occurring without cerebral disease leads to a clinically important proposal to change cerebral to renal salt wasting (RSW). Differentiating SIADH from RSW is difficult because of identical clinical parameters that characterize both syndromes. Determination of fractional urate excretion (FEurate) is central to a new algorithm, which has proven to be superior to current methods. We utilized this algorithm and differences in physiologic response to isotonic saline infusions between SIADH and RSW to evaluate hyponatremic patients from the general medical wards of the hospital. In 62 hyponatremic patients, 17 (27%) had SIADH, 19 (31%) had reset osmostat (RO), 24 (38%) had RSW, 1 due to HCTZ and 1 Addison's disease. Interestingly, 21 of 24 with RSW had no evidence of cerebral disease and 10 of 24 with RSW had UNa < 20 mEqL. We conclude that 1. RSW is much more common than is perceived, 2.the term cerebral salt wasting should be changed to RSW 3. RO should be eliminated as a subclass of SIADH, 4. SIADH should be redefined 5. The volume approach is ineffective and 6. There are limitations to determining UNa, plasma renin, aldosterone or atrial/brain natriuretic peptides. We also present data on a natriuretic peptide found in sera of patients with RSW and Alzheimer's disease.",How Synthetic Biology and Metabolic Engineering Can Boost the Generation of Artificial Blood Using Microbial Production Hosts.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30560125,Frontiers in bioengineering and biotechnology,2018 12 20,"Hemoglobin is an essential protein to the human body as it transports oxygen to organs and tissues through the bloodstream (Looker et al., 1992). In recent years, there has been an increasing concern regarding the global supply of this vital protein, as blood availability cannot currently meet the high demands in many developing countries. There are, in addition, several risks associated with conventional blood transfusions such as the presence of blood-borne viruses like HIV and Hepatitis. These risks along with some limitations are presented in Figure 1 (Kim and Greenburg, 2013; Martínez et al., 2015). As an alternative, producing hemoglobin recombinantly will eliminate the obstacles, since hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers are pathogen-free, have a longer shelf-life, are universally compatible and the supply can be adjusted to meet the demands (Chakane, 2017). A stable, safe, and most importantly affordable production, will lead to high availability of blood to the world population, and hence reduce global inequality, which is a focus point of the World Health Organization for the millennium (WHO, 2018). Synthetic biology and metabolic engineering have created a unique opportunity to construct promising candidates for hemoglobin production (Liu et al., 2014; Martínez et al., 2016). This review sets out to describe the recent advances in recombinant hemoglobin production, the societal and the economic impact along with the challenges that researchers will face in the coming years, such as low productivity, degradation, and difficulties in scale-up. The challenges are diverse and complex but with the powerful tools provided by synthetic biology and metabolic engineering, they are no longer insurmountable. An efficient production of cell-free recombinant hemoglobin poses tremendous challenges while having even greater potential, therefore some possible future directions are suggested in this review.",Cytotoxic Activity of Fatty Acids From Antarctic Macroalgae on the Growth of Human Breast Cancer Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30560124,Frontiers in bioengineering and biotechnology,2018 12 20,"Macroalgae are a natural source of clinically relevant molecules such as polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fatty acids. The Antarctic environment, due to its cold climate, leads to high production of these bioactive molecules. Adenocystis utricularis, Curdiea racovitzae, and Georgiella confluens from three distinct islands in the Antarctic Peninsula were collected and analyzed for their fatty acid content by gas chromatography flame ionization detection. Results revealed that the algal extracts consisted of 22 fatty acids, of which 9 were saturated, 4 were monounsaturated, and 9 were polyunsaturated (PUFA). In addition, fucosterol was identified within the lipidic extracts. The cytotoxic activity of these fatty acids was evaluated in human breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231. The most notable result was the effect of PUFA on the growth inhibition of cancer cells ranging from 61.04 to 69.78% in comparison to control cells. Significant cytotoxic activity of fatty acids from A. utricularis was observed at 48 h, resulting in an inhibition of growth of more than 50% for breast cancer cells at a concentration of 100 μg/mL. A cell viability assay showed that the fatty acids from A. utricularis significantly reduced cell viability (68.7% in MCF-7 and 89% in MDA-MB-231 after 72 h of exposure). At the same time, DAPI staining demonstrated chromatin condensation, and apoptotic bodies formed in cells that were cultured with fatty acids from A. utricularis. These data indicate that fatty acids from Antarctic macroalgae have the potential to reduce the proliferation of and induce apoptosis in breast cancer cells.",Reusable Flexible Concentric Electrodes Coated With a Conductive Graphene Ink for Electrotactile Stimulation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30560123,Frontiers in bioengineering and biotechnology,2018 12 20,"Electrotactile stimulation is a highly promising technique for providing sensory feedback information for prosthetics.

These homopolymeric PHAs can be produced by β-oxidation defective bacterial hosts. Escherichia coli is an attractive workhorse for the production of such genetically engineered PHAs; however, achieving efficient production of the near homopolymers by β-oxidation defective strains is a major challenge because of a lack of process development studies. In order to address this issue, we investigated the optimization of carbon feeding for efficient production of MCL-PHAs by an E. coli strain with defective β-oxidation, LSBJ. Engineered bacteria were cultured in shake-flasks with intermittent feeding of a fatty acid substrate [either decanoate (C10) or dodecanoate (C12)] at various concentrations together with a co-carbon source (glucose, glycerol, or xylose) in order to support cell growth. It was found that feeding low concentrations of both fatty acids and co-carbon sources led to an enhanced production of MCL-PHAs. Additionally, the supplementation of yeast extract improved cell growth, resulting in achieving higher titers of MCL-PHA. As a result, poly(3-hydroxydecanoate) [P(3HD)] and poly(3-hydroxydodecanoate) [P(3HDD)] were produced up to 5.44 g/L and 3.50 g/L, respectively, as near homopolymers by employing the developed feeding strategy. To the best of our knowledge, we record the highest titer of P(3HD) ever reported so far.",Photoelectrochemical Gas-Electrolyte-Solid Phase Boundary for Hydrogen Production From Water Vapor.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30560121,Frontiers in chemistry,2018 12 20,"Hydrogen production from humidity in the ambient air reduces the maintenance costs for sustainable solar-driven water splitting.

The gas-electrolyte-solid triple phase boundary enhanced not only the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) of the WO3 photoanode but also the Faraday efficiency (FE) of oxygen evolution in the gas-phase water oxidation process. The IPCE was 7.5% at an applied voltage of 1.2 V under 453 nm blue light irradiation. The FE of hydrogen evolution in the proton exchange membrane photoelectrochemical cell was close to 100%, and the produced hydrogen was separated from the photoanode reaction by the membrane. A comparison of the gas-phase photoelectrochemical reaction with that in liquid-phase aqueous media confirmed the importance of the triple phase boundary for realizing water vapor splitting.",Eukaryotic Cell Toxicity and HSA Binding of [Ru(Me4phen)(bb7)]2+ and the Effect of Encapsulation in Cucurbit[10]uril.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30560120,Frontiers in chemistry,2018 12 20,"The toxicity (IC50) of a series of mononuclear ruthenium complexes containing bis[4(4'-methyl-2,2'-bipyridyl)]-1,n-alkane (bbn) as a tetradentate ligand against three eukaryotic cell lines-BHK (baby hamster kidney), Caco-2 (heterogeneous human epithelial colorectal adenocarcinoma) and Hep-G2 (liver carcinoma)-have been determined. The results demonstrate that cis-α-[Ru(Me4phen)(bb7)]2+ (designated as α-Me4phen-bb7, where Me4phen = 3,4,7,8-tetramethyl-1,10-phenanthroline) showed little toxicity toward the three cell lines, and was considerably less toxic than cis-α-[Ru(phen)(bb12)]2+ (α-phen-bb12) and the dinuclear complex [{Ru(phen)2}2{μ-bb12}]4+. Fluorescence spectroscopy was used to study the binding of the ruthenium complexes with human serum albumin (HSA). The binding of α-Me4phen-bb7 to the macrocyclic host molecule cucurbit[10]uril (Q[10]) was examined by NMR spectroscopy. Large upfield 1H NMR chemical shift changes observed for the methylene protons in the bb7 ligand upon addition of Q[10], coupled with the observation of several intermolecular ROEs in ROESY spectra, indicated that α-Me4phen-bb7 bound Q[10] with the bb7 methylene carbons within the cavity and the metal center positioned outside one of the portals. Simple molecular modeling confirmed the feasibility of the binding model. An α-Me4phen-bb7-Q[10] binding constant of 9.9 ± 0.2 × 106 M-1 was determined by luminescence spectroscopy. Q[10]-encapsulation decreased the toxicity of α-Me4phen-bb7 against the three eukaryotic cell lines and increased the binding affinity of the ruthenium complex for HSA. Confocal microscopy experiments indicated that the level of accumulation of α-Me4phen-7 in BHK cells is not significantly affected by Q[10]-encapsulation. Taken together, the combined results suggest that α-Me4phen-7 could be a good candidate as a new antimicrobial agent, and Q[10]-encapsulation could be a method to improve the pharmacokinetics of the ruthenium complex.","Growth of CNT Forests on Titanium Based Layers, Detailed Study of Catalysts.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30560119,Frontiers in chemistry,2018 12 20,"For better electrical contacts of potential devices, growth of vertically aligned carbon nanotubes (CNT forests) directly onto conductive substrates is an emerging challenge.

Other important parameters, such as the influence of water vapor or the Fe-Co catalyst ratio, were also studied during the synthesis. As-prepared CNT forests were characterized by various techniques: scanning and transmission electron microscopies, Raman spectroscopy, spectroscopic ellipsometry. CNT forests grown directly onto the conductive substrate were also tested as electrodes in hybrid halide perovskite photodetectors and found to be effective in detecting light of intensity as low as 3 nW."

In the present study, Rv1288 and its domains (Est and Lyt) were cloned individually from M.tb into E. coli for expression and purification. The purified rRv1288 and rEst proteins exhibited lipolytic activity with medium chain length esters as optimum substrates, while Lyt domain did not show enzymatic activity. However, presence of Lyt domain resulted in enhanced rate of protein aggregation at higher temperature. Both rRv1288 and rEst followed the similar patterns of substrate specificity, temperature and pH activity. Site directed mutagenesis confirmed the Ser-294, Asp-391 and His-425 as catalytic site residues. Rv1288 was found to be present in cell wall fraction of M.tb H37Ra. Peptidoglycan binding activity of Rv1288 and its domains demonstrated that the Lyt domain is essential for anchoring protein to the cell wall. Expression of rv1288 was up regulated in M.tb under nutrient starved condition. Over expression of rv1288 in surrogate host M. smegmatis led to change in colony morphology, enhanced pellicle and aggregate formation that might be linked with the changed lipid composition of bacterial cell wall.

Resistance against all currently available antimalarial drugs is a growing threat, and represents a major and long-standing obstacle to malaria eradication. Like many intracellular pathogens, Plasmodium parasites manipulate host cell signaling pathways, in particular programmed cell death pathways. Interference with apoptotic pathways by malaria parasites is documented in the mosquito and human liver stages of infection, but little is known about this phenomenon in the erythrocytic stages. Although mature erythrocytes have lost all organelles, they display a form of programmed cell death termed eryptosis. Numerous features of eryptosis resemble those of nucleated cell apoptosis, including surface exposure of phosphatidylserine, cell shrinkage and membrane ruffling. Upon invasion, Plasmodium parasites induce significant stress to the host erythrocyte, while delaying the onset of eryptosis. Many eryptotic inducers appear to have a beneficial effect on the course of malaria infection in murine models, but major gaps remain in our understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms. All currently available antimalarial drugs have parasite-encoded targets, which facilitates the emergence of resistance through selection of mutations that prevent drug-target binding. Identifying host cell factors that play a key role in parasite survival will provide new perspectives for host-directed anti-malarial chemotherapy. This review focuses on the interrelationship between Plasmodium falciparum and the eryptosis of its host erythrocyte. We summarize the current knowledge in this area, highlight the different schools of thoughts and existing gaps in knowledge, and discuss future perspectives for host-directed therapies in the context of antimalarial drug discovery.",Multimorbidity patterns and 5-year overall mortality: Results from a claims data-based observational study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30560093,Journal of comorbidity,2018 12 20,"Multimorbidity is prevalent and related to adverse outcomes.

This review compared the dentoskeletal stability of treatment results between conventional orthognathic surgery methods with presurgical orthodontic treatment and surgery-first approach in skeletal class III patients. The study protocol was based on Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement for systematic review and meta-analysis. Electronic and manual searches for literature since 2011 were conducted. PubMed and Medline databases were accessed. Data extraction and analysis were performed by two independent individuals. Seven studies out of hundred-fourteen articles met the inclusion criteria and were selected for qualitative analysis. The included studies were 494 patients with skeletal class-III malocclusion. Stability of treatment was compared between surgery-first approach and conventionally treated patients. The statistical analysis confirmed that surgery-first approach did not show more stability compared with presurgical orthodontics. The surgery-first approach shortened the overall treatment duration. However, more skeletal stability in conventional treatment was assessed. Both surgery-first approach and conventional treatment with presurgical orthodontics resulted in favorable skeletal changes in class-III malocclusion patients. Moreover, these findings should be discussed further due to the variety of study designs, outcomes and biases. Current evidence in this field still needs to be expanded. The authors wish to see more well-designed randomized controlled trials with long-term follow ups to confirm the results.",What Is the Role of Plastic Surgery in Global Health? A Review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30560065,World journal of plastic surgery,2018 12 20,"There is growing awareness of the substantial global burden of surgical disease. Conditions treated effectively by plastic and reconstructive procedures make a large proportion of the global surgical diseases, and disproportionately affect individuals at the lower end of the economic spectrum. This article reviews the role of plastic surgery in global health, highlights the ongoing need for plastic and reconstructive surgery globally, and increasing efforts that have been made to meet these needs. There global shortage of plastic surgeons in low and middle income countries, but plastic surgery has a long tradition of humanitarian aid, has been a leader in global surgery development. Plastic and reconstructive surgical care has increasingly been shown to be cost effective and to have an immense impact on the economy of a region, delivering a substantial return on investment. More sustainable global surgical care is essential in future, requiring ongoing efforts from the plastic surgery community, greater recognition of the problems that can be addressed at policy level, and research to help guide policy-makers when facing the decision of allocating scarce resources. There is a fundamental role of plastic surgery in global health.",Optimization of an erythroid culture system to reduce the cost of in vitro production of red blood cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30560064,MethodsX,2018 12 20,"In vitro generation of red blood cells has become a goal for scientists globally. Directly, in vitro-generated red blood cells (RBCs) may close the gap between blood supply obtained through blood donation and high demand for therapeutic uses. In addition, the cells obtained can be used as a model for haematologic disorders to allow the study of their pathophysiology and novel treatment discovery. For those reasons, a number of RBC culture systems have been established and shown to be successful; however, the cost of each millilitre of packed RBC is still extremely high. In order to reduce the cost, we aim to see if we can reduce the number of factors used in the existing culture system. In this study, we examined how well haematopoietic stem cells proliferate and differentiate into mature red blood cells with modified culture system. •Absence of extra heparin or insulin or both from the erythroid differentiation media did not affect haematopoietic stem cell proliferation and differentiation. Therefore, we show that the cost and complexity of erythroid culture can be reduced, which may improve the feasibility of in vitro generation of red blood cells."

Previously, eleven patients have been reported and most of them have compound heterozygous SZT2 variants, leading to premature termination. In these patients, all reported variants were unique and there were no common pathogenic variants identified. In this study, we identified a paternal uniparental disomy of chromosome 1 in a patient with a neurodevelopmental disorder associated with severe intellectual disability, intractable epilepsy, autistic features, distinctive features, and transient macrocephaly. This resulted in homozygous patterns through chromosome 1. Among the variants in chromosome 1, a rare SZT2 variant, NM_015284.3:c.6553C>T (p.Arg2185Trp), was selected as a powerful candidate variant in this patient. Although the clinical features of this patient are relatively milder than that reported previously, it may be derived from genetic heterogeneity.

Discussion of cerebral vascular malformations is an important element of patient management. The current study objectives were to examine uptake and results of screening cerebral magnetic resonance (MR) scans, excluding symptomatic patients requiring neurological investigations. The remaining non-symptomatic individuals received formal pretest counselling that differed according to family history. For the 603 patients with no neurological symptoms of concern, screening scan uptake was higher after publication of the ARUBA trial. Patients with a family history of cerebral haemorrhage were 4 to 14-fold more likely to have a screening scan than patients with no such family history. For patients without neurological symptoms suggesting cerebral AVMs, none of the 59 screening scans performed at our institution demonstrated a cerebral AVM. Four scans (6.8%) demonstrated small aneurysms. The most common abnormality was cerebral infarction (20/59, 33.9%), predominantly identified in patients with pulmonary AVMs. Of 29 pulmonary AVM patients with no previous history of clinical stroke, 16 (55.2%) had between one and five silent infarcts. For HHT patients with pulmonary AVMs, the most frequently affected sites were the cerebellum (40%) and thalamus (14.3%), and the age-adjusted odds ratio for an infarct was 21.6 (95% confidence intervals 3.7, 126), p = 0.001. We concluded that for cerebral screening programmes in HHT, the findings support informed patient choice incorporating understanding that cerebral AVMs are rare in non-symptomatic HHT patients, but that screening scans commonly detect silent cerebral infarction due to pulmonary AVMs.",Aging-associated latent herpes viral infection in normal Japanese individuals and patients with Werner syndrome.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30560014,Intractable & rare diseases research,2018 12 20,"A series of our ""inflammageing"" study examining serum samples from a maximum of 217 healthy Japanese individuals aged between 1 and 100 years and mutation-proven 40 patients with Werner syndrome (WS) indicated normal aging-associated elevations of highly sensitive CRP (hsCRP) and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9). To further study the contribution of environmental factors such as persistent herpes viral infection to inflammageing, IgG antibodies against varicella/zoster virus (VZV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) were examined in the same serum samples as has been done for hsCRP and MMP-9 analyses. The mean levels of serum IgG viral antibodies were comparable between normal (mean ± SE: 31.0 ± 4.3 unit) and WS (38.6 ± 7.6) for CMV, and between normal (42.0 ± 12.2) and WS (29.8 ± 3.8) for VZV, respectively. Significant associations of aging with IgG anti-CMV antibody were in normal aging (p = 0.023) and WS (p = 0.037), but not with IgG VZV in both conditions. Aging-associated change of IgG anti-CMV antibody titer in WS increased significantly (1.32 times higher) compared with normal aging (p = 0.037). IgG anti-CMV level was significantly elevated in the male gender than female in both conditions (p = 0.006). Elevated hsCRP level was significantly associated with IgG anti-CMV (p = 0.016) and IgG anti-VZV (p = 0.008) antibodies in normal aging, but not in WS. Serum MMP-9 was significantly associated with IgG anti-CMV level (p = 0.0002) in normal aging, but not in WS.

Local and global completion factors have been examined in previous studies, which also apply to the apparent slimming effect. Exposed parts of the body constitute the local factor at the junction area, while the shape or cut of the clothes is concerned with the whole configuration. This study investigated which is more important, the local or whole factors, for amodal completion in relation to the apparent slimming effect using drawings as stimuli. In Experiment 1, we examined the effects of the length and cut of a skirt. The length of the skirt corresponds to the local factor of the body, that is, the legs, because the exposed parts of the legs depend on skirt length (assuming a person of consistent height). We found that skirts' cut influenced their effect more than their length did. Experiments 2 and 3 revealed that the vertical form of clothes affects slimming by hiding thicker parts of the body and highlighting thinner parts. A supplemental experiment using geometrical figures suggested that the apparent slimming effect of clothes might occur only in the human body configuration.",Bistable Perception Is Biased by Search Items but Not by Search Priming.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30559956,i-Perception,2018 12 20,"During visual search, selecting a target facilitates search for similar targets in the future, known as search priming. During bistable perception, in turn, perceiving one interpretation facilitates perception of the same interpretation in the future, a form of sensory memory. Previously, we investigated the relation between these history effects by asking: can visual search influence perception of a subsequent ambiguous display and can perception of an ambiguous display influence subsequent visual search? We found no evidence for such influences, however. Here, we investigated one potential factor that might have prevented such influences from arising: lack of retinal overlap between the ambiguous stimulus and the search array items. In the present work, we therefore interleaved presentations of an ambiguous stimulus with search trials in which the target or distractor occupied the same retinal location as the ambiguous stimulus. Nevertheless, we again found no evidence for influences of visual search on bistable perception, thus demonstrating no close relation between search priming and sensory memory. We did, however, find that visual search items primed perception of a subsequent ambiguous stimulus at the same retinal location, regardless of whether they were a target or a distractor item: a form of perceptual priming. Interestingly, the strengths of search priming and this perceptual priming were correlated on a trial-to-trial basis, suggesting that a common underlying factor influences both.",Modeling the quantitative nature of neurodevelopmental disorders using Collaborative Cross mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30559955,Molecular autism,2019 01 28,Animal models for neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD) generally rely on a single genetic mutation on a fixed genetic background.

Moreover, technical details in FCS-EV depletion protocols are known to vary between labs, which may lead to inter-study differences in contaminating FCS-RNA levels. Here, we investigated how technical modifications of EV-depletion protocols affect the efficiency with which bovine RNAs are depleted from FCS, and determined the contribution of contaminating bovine RNA to EV-RNA purified from cell cultures. Our data show differences in depletion efficiency between and within various classes of small non-coding RNA. Importantly, we demonstrate that variations in FCS-EV depletion protocols affect both the quantity and type of residual FCS-RNAs in EV-depleted medium. By using optimised FCS-EV depletion protocols combined with methods for high-grade purification of EV the levels of contaminating bovine RNA in EV populations isolated from cell culture medium can be reduced. With illustrative datasets we also demonstrate that the abundance of a specific RNA in cell culture EV can only be determined if measured relative to background levels of this RNA in medium control samples. These data highlight the need for optimisation and validation of existing and novel FCS-EV depletion methods and urge for accurate descriptions of these methods in publications to increase experimental reproducibility."

The differential expression of the two forms of miR-140 in both NSCLC tissues and cell lines was determined by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). The effects of the miR-140 mimics on the malignant properties of lung cancer cells were evaluated using invasion assay, adhesion assay, tubule formation assay and metabolite profiling. Biotin-miRNA pulldown and transcriptome profiling by RNA-seq were utilized to distinguish their mRNA targets of the miR-140 strands. Their downstream signalling pathways were unveiled using a high-throughput antibody array. Although both strands of the miR-140 are downregulated in the NSCLC, miR-140-3p is more predominant compared to miR-140-5p in lung cancer cell lines. Both miR-140 mimics suppress the invasion of lung cancer cells and the inhibitory effect of the miR-140 on adhesion is cell-dependent. Tumor conditioned media from A549 cells after treatment with miR-140-3p mimic reduce the tubule formation ability of the endothelial cells. Metabolite profiling indicates the alteration of glycine in both lung cancer cells following treatment with miR-140 mimics. The data from the RNA-sequencing and antibody array indicate that two miR-140 strands present different targeting and signalling profiles despite the existence of mutual targets such as IGF1R and FOS. In conclusion, two forms of miR-140 both suppress the malignant properties of lung cancer cells but through distinct and multiple mechanisms.",Tissue proteomics outlines AGR2 AND LOX5 as markers for biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30559929,Oncotarget,2018 12 20,"Although many patients are cured from prostate cancer (PCa) by surgery only, there are still patients who will experience rising prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels after surgery, a condition known as biochemical recurrence (BCR). Novel protein prognostic markers in PCa tissue might enable finding better treatment for those patients experiencing BCR with a high chance of metastasis. In this study, we aimed to identify altered proteins in prostate cancer tissue, and to evaluate their potential role as prognostic markers. We used two proteomics strategies to analyse 34 prostate tumours (PCa) and 33 normal adjacent prostate (NAP) tissues. An independent cohort of 481 samples was used to evaluate the expression of three proteins: AGR2, FASN and LOX5 as prognostic markers of the disease. Tissue microarray immunohistochemical staining indicated that a low percentage of positive tumour cells for AGR2 (HR (95% CI) = 0.61 (0.43-0.93)), and a low percentage of positive tumour cells for LOX5 expression (HR (95% CI) = 2.53 (1.23-5.22)) are predictors of BCR after RP.

Whilst the primary function of Lect2 is thought to be in modulating the inflammatory process, it has recently been implicated as a potential inhibitor of the Wnt pathway. Deregulation of the Wnt pathway, often due to loss of the negative regulator APC, is found in ~80% of colorectal cancer (CRC). Here we have used the ApcMin/+Lect2-/- mouse model to characterise the role of Lect2 in Wnt-driven intestinal tumourigenesis. Histopathological, immunohistochemical, PCR and flow cytometry analysis were employed to identify the role of Lect2 in the intestine. The ApcMin/+Lect2-/- mice had a reduced mean survival and a significantly increased number of adenomas in the small intestine with increased severity. Analysis of Lect2 loss indicated it had no effect on the Wnt pathway in the intestine but significant differences were observed in circulating inflammatory markers, CD4+ T cells, and T cell lineage-specification factors. In summary, in the murine intestine loss of Lect2 promotes the initiation and progression of Wnt-driven colorectal cancer. This protection is performed independently of the Wnt signalling pathway and is associated with an altered inflammatory environment during Wnt-driven tumorigenesis.",Ewing sarcoma resistance to SP-2509 is not mediated through KDM1A/LSD1 mutation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30559927,Oncotarget,2019 01 19,"Ewing sarcoma is the second most common solid bone malignancy diagnosed in pediatric and young adolescent populations. Despite global co-operative efforts, outcomes for patients with relapsed and refractory disease remains obstinately poor. It has become increasingly clear that disruption of the epigenome as a result of alterations in epigenetic regulators, plays a pivotal role in tumorigenesis. As such, this study investigated Ewing sarcoma mechanisms of acquired resistance to the small molecule reversible lysine specific demethylase (LSD1/KDM1A) inhibitor SP-2509. Surprisingly, whole exome sequencing analysis of our generated A673 SP-2509 drug resistant cell line revealed an absence of mutations in KDM1A. Compared to parental counterparts, SP-2509 drug resistant cells demonstrated decreased anchorage independent growth capacity, enhanced sensitivity to the HDAC inhibitors vorinostat/entinostat and a distinct transcriptional profile that was enriched for extracellular matrix proteins. SP-2509 drug resistant cells also exhibited elevated expression levels of the multi-drug resistance genes ABCB1, ABCC3, and ABBC5 and decreased expression of the transcriptional repressor RCOR1/CoREST. Following several months of SP-2509 withdrawal, low level SP-2509 resistance was still apparent (6.3 fold increase in IC50), with drug resistant cell populations maintaining their distinct transcriptional profile. Furthermore, compared to parental cells, washout drug resistant lines displayed equal sensitivity to the standard Ewing sarcoma chemotherapeutic agent's vincristine and doxorubicin. Together these findings indicate that resistance to SP-2509 is not fully reversible or driven by direct mutation in KDM1A.",An Economic Analysis of Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 94-10: Cost-Efficacy of Concurrent vs. Sequential Chemoradiotherapy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30559923,Journal of radiation oncology,2019 06 10,"Cost can be a major issue in therapeutic decision-making, and in particular for patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (LA-NSCLC).",TIME RESOLVED DISPLACEMENT-BASED REGISTRATION OF IN VIVO CDTI CARDIOMYOCYTE ORIENTATIONS.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30559922,Proceedings.

In order to limit bulk motion artifacts and acquisition time, cDTI microstructural data is acquired at a single cardiac phase necessitating registration to the reference configuration on which the patient-specific computational models are based. Herein, we propose a method to register subject-specific microstructural data to an arbitrary cardiac phase using measured cardiac displacements. We validate our approach using a subject-specific computational phantom based on data from human subjects. Compared to a geometry-based non-rigid registration method, the displacement-based registration leads to improved accuracy (less than 1° versus 10° average median error in cardiomyocyte angular differences) and tighter confidence interval (3° versus 65° average upper limit of the 95% confidence interval).","Facile Removal of Homogeneous SABRE Catalysts for Purifying Hyperpolarized Metronidazole, a Potential Hypoxia Sensor.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30559921,"The journal of physical chemistry.

Following microTesla SABRE hyperpolarization of 15N spins in metronidazole, addition of SiO2 microparticles functionalized with 3-mercaptopropyl or 2-mercaptoethyl ethyl sulfide moieties provides removal of the catalyst from solution well within the hyperpolarization decay time at 0.3 T (T1>3 mins)-and enabling transfer to 9.4 T for detection of enhanced 15N signals in the absence of catalyst within the NMR-detection region. Successful catalyst removal from solution is supported by the inability to ""re-hyperpolarize"" 15N spins in subsequent attempts, as well as by 1H NMR and ICP-MS. Record-high 15N nuclear polarization of up to ~34% was achieved, corresponding to >100,000-fold enhancement at 9.4 T, and approximately 5/6th of the 15N hyperpolarization is retained after ~20-second-long purification procedure.

Preservation of normal structures may also be improved. As the use of this tool is increasing, the need for better understanding of the anatomy of the ear is becoming evident. This is particularly so for endoscopic surgery aiming at removal of lesions involving the infra-cochlear corridor and/or petrous apex. Human temporal bone-derived labyrinth casts (molds), originally made for endolymphatic duct and sac analysis which genuinely represent the membranous labyrinth and its adjacent soft tissues, were morphometrically analyzed in terms of the anatomic relations between structures in and around the infra-cochlear corridor. The distance between the petrous carotid artery (PCA) and the basal turn of the cochlea, the distance between PCA and infra-cochlear vein (ICV)/cochlear aqueduct (CA), and the distance between the lower surface of basal cochlear turn and the point where the carotid artery and jugular vein (JV) meet close to the jugular foramen, were measured to be around 1.3 mm, 6 mm and 8 mm respectively, thus constituting an approximate 6 × 8 mm2 infra-cochlear corridor.

However, in rats, isoflurane-induced auditory impairments have only been assessed with auditory brainstem responses; a measure which is unable to distinguish if changes originate from the central or peripheral auditory system. Studies performed in other species, such as mice and guinea-pigs, suggests auditory impairment stems from disrupted OHC amplification. Despite the wide use of the rat in auditory research, these observations have yet to be replicated in the rat animal model. This study used distortion product otoacoustic emissions to assess outer hair cell function in rats that were anesthetized with either isoflurane or a ketamine/xylazine cocktail for approximately 45 min. Results indicate that isoflurane can significantly reduce DPOAE amplitudes compared to ketamine/xylazine, and that responses were more variable with isoflurane than ketamine/xylazine over the 45-min test period.

Though blast's direct effects on the cochlea and vestibular organs are active areas of study, little attention has been given to the ear's contribution to the overall spectrum of blast injury. Acute autonomic responses to blast exposure, including bradycardia and hypotension, can cause hypoxia and contribute to blast-induced neurotrauma. Existing literature suggests that these autonomic responses are elicited through blast impacting the thorax and lungs. We hypothesize that the unprotected ear also provides a vulnerable locus for blast to cause autonomic responses. We designed a blast generator that delivers controlled overpressure waves into the ear canal without impacting surrounding tissues in order to study the ear's specific contribution to blast injury. Anesthetized adult rats' left ears were exposed to a single blast wave ranging from 0 to 110 PSI (0-758 kPa). Blast exposed rats exhibited decreased heart rates and blood pressures with increased blast intensity, similar to results gathered using shock tubes and whole-body exposure in the literature. While rats exposed to blasts below 50 PSI (345 kPa) exhibited increased respiratory rate with increased blast intensity, some rats exposed to blasts higher than 50 PSI (345 kPa) stopped breathing immediately and ultimately died. These autonomic responses were significantly reduced in vagally denervated rats, again similar to whole-body exposure literature. These results support the hypothesis that the unprotected ear contributes to the autonomic responses to blast.",Hidden cochlear impairments.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30559763,Journal of otology,2018 12 21,"Pure tone audiometry is a routine clinical examination used to identify hearing loss. A normal pure tone audiogram is usually taken as evidence of normal hearing. Auditory deficits detected in subjects with normal audiograms, such as poor sound discrimination and auditory perceptual disorders, are generally attributed to central problems. Does the pure tone audiogram truly reflect cochlear status? Recent evidence suggests that individuals with normal audiogram may still have reduced peripheral auditory responses but normal central responses, indicating that the pure tone audiometry may not detect some types of cochlear injuries. In the cochlea, the outer hair cells (OHCs), inner hair cells (IHCs), and the spiral ganglion neurons that synapse with IHCs are the 3 key cochlear components in transducing acoustical vibrations into the neural signals. This report reviews three types of cochlear damage identified in laboratory animals that may not lead to overt hearing loss. The first type of cochlear impairment, such as missing a certain proportion of IHCs without damage to OHCs, may reduce the cochlear output and elevate response threshold; however, the reduced peripheral auditory sensitivity may be restored along the auditory pathway via central gain enhancement. The second type of cochlear impairment, such as selective damage to the synapses of the high-threshold thin auditory nerve fibers (ANFs), reduces cochlear output at high stimulation levels with no effect on response threshold. In this case the reduced cochlear output may be compensated along the auditory pathway as well. The third type of cochlear impairment, such as missing a certain number of OHCs without damage to others, may not even affect cochlear function at all. These ""hidden"" cochlear impairments do not result in overt hearing loss, but they may increase the vulnerability of the cochlea to traumatic exposure and lead to disrupted central auditory processing.",DREAMSeq: An Improved Method for Analyzing Differentially Expressed Genes in RNA-seq Data.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30559761,Frontiers in genetics,2018 12 20,"RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) has become a widely used technology for analyzing global gene-expression changes during certain biological processes. It is generally acknowledged that RNA-seq data displays equidispersion and overdispersion characteristics; therefore, most RNA-seq analysis methods were developed based on a negative binomial model capable of capturing both equidispersed and overdispersed data. In this study, we reported that in addition to equidispersion and overdispersion, RNA-seq data also displays underdispersion characteristics that cannot be adequately captured by general RNA-seq analysis methods. Based on a double Poisson model capable of capturing all data characteristics, we developed a new RNA-seq analysis method (DREAMSeq). Comparison of DREAMSeq with five other frequently used RNA-seq analysis methods using simulated datasets showed that its performance was comparable to or exceeded that of other methods in terms of type I error rate, statistical power, receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve, area under the ROC curve, precision-recall curve, and the ability to detect the number of differentially expressed genes, especially in situations involving underdispersion. These results were validated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction using a real Foxtail dataset. Our findings demonstrated DREAMSeq as a reliable, robust, and powerful new method for RNA-seq data mining.

Of these variants, rs7805747 in PRKAG2 was identified to be significantly associated with both serum creatinine and CKD with genome wide significance level. Until now, the potential mechanism by which rs7805747 affects CKD risk is still unclear. Here, we performed a functional analysis of rs7805747 variant using multiple bioinformatics software and databases. Using RegulomeDB and HaploReg (version 4.1), rs7805747 was predicated to locate in enhancer histone marks (Liver, Duodenum Mucosa, Fetal Intestine Large, Fetal Intestine Small, and Right Ventricle tissues). Using GWAS analysis in PhenoScanner, we showed that rs7805747 is not only associated with CKD, but also is significantly associated with other diseases or phenotypes. Using metabolite analysis in PhenoScanner, rs7805747 is identified to be significantly associated with not only the serum creatinine, but also with other 16 metabolites. Using eQTL analysis in PhenoScanner, rs7805747 is identified to be significantly associated with gene expression in multiple human tissues and multiple genes including PRKAG2. The gene expression analysis of PRKAG2 using 53 tissues from GTEx RNA-Seq of 8555 samples (570 donors) in GTEx showed that PRKAG2 had the highest median expression in Heart-Atrial Appendage. Using the gene expression profiles in human CKD, we further identified different expression of PRKAG2 gene in CKD cases compared with control samples. In summary, our findings provide new insight into the underlying susceptibility of PRKAG2 gene to CKD."

Naive CD4+ T cells that have been primed by antigen develop into memory or effector cells, which may be distinguished by their capability to exert a long-term and rapid response upon re-challenge by antigen, to produce distinct cytokines and surface marker expression phenotypes such as CD45RA/RO, CD27, CD62L, and CCR7. Moreover, a distinct lineage of memory T cells populates tissues (tissue-resident memory T cells or TRM cells) which orchestratea the response to pathogens re encountered at tissue sites. Recent evidence, however, has highlighted that CD4+ naive T cells are much more heterogeneous that previously thought, and that they harbor diversity in phenotypes, differentiation stages, persistence, functions, and anatomic localizations. These cells represent cellular subsets that are extremely heterogeneous and multifunctional at their very initial stages of differentiation, with the potential to become ""atypical"" memory and effector cells. In this mini review, we focus on recently obtained data from studies in humans, in which this newly recognized heterogeneity in the naive T cell pool was discovered in terms of surface marker expression, cytokine production, or transcriptomic profiles. The deep analysis of immune functions at the single cell level combined with a better understanding of the generation and maintenance of the various atypical memory CD4+ T cell subsets with a naive-like phenotype will be important in immune-monitoring of vaccination and immunotherapies in infectious diseases.",The Adhesion G Protein-Coupled Receptor GPR97/ADGRG3 Is Expressed in Human Granulocytes and Triggers Antimicrobial Effector Functions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30559745,Frontiers in immunology,2018 12 20,"The adhesion family of G protein-coupled receptors (aGPCRs) comprises 33 members in human, several of which are distinctly expressed and functionally involved in polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs). As former work indicated the possible presence of the aGPCR GPR97 in granulocytes, we studied its cellular distribution, molecular structure, signal transduction, and biological function in PMNs. RNA sequencing and mass-spectrometry revealed abundant RNA and protein expression of ADGRG3/GPR97 in granulocyte precursors and terminally differentiated neutrophilic, eosinophilic, and basophilic granulocytes. Using a newly generated GPR97-specific monoclonal antibody, we confirmed that endogenous GPR97 is a proteolytically processed, dichotomous, N-glycosylated receptor. GPR97 was detected in tissue-infiltrating PMNs and upregulated during systemic inflammation. Antibody ligation of GPR97 increased neutrophil reactive oxygen species production and proteolytic enzyme activity, which is accompanied by an increase in mitogen-activated protein kinases and IκBα phosphorylation. In-depth analysis of the GPR97 signaling cascade revealed a possible switch from basal Gαs/cAMP-mediated signal transduction to a Gαi-induced reduction in cAMP levels upon mutation-induced activation of the receptor, in combination with an increase in downstream effectors of Gβγ, such as SRE and NF-κB. Finally, ligation of GPR97 increased the bacteria uptake and killing activity of neutrophils. We conclude that the specific presence of GPR97 regulates antimicrobial activity in human granulocytes.",B Cell Siglecs-News on Signaling and Its Interplay With Ligand Binding.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30559744,Frontiers in immunology,2018 12 20,"CD22 and Siglec-G are members of the Siglec family. Both are inhibitory co-receptors on the surface of B cells and inhibit B-cell receptor induced signaling, characterized by inhibition of the calcium mobilization and cellular activation. CD22 functions predominantly as an inhibitor on conventional B cells, while Siglec-G is an important inhibitor on the B1a-cell subset. These two B-cell Siglecs do not only inhibit initial signaling, but also have an important function in preventing autoimmunity, as double deficient mice develop a lupus-like phenotype with age. Siglecs are characterized by their conserved ability to bind terminal sialic acid of glycans on the cell surface, which is important to regulate the inhibitory role of Siglecs. While CD22 binds α2,6-linked sialic acids, Siglec-G can bind both α2,6-linked and α2,3-linked sialic acids. Interestingly, ligand binding is differentially regulating the ability of CD22 and Siglec-G to control B-cell activation. Within the last years, quite a few studies focused on the different functions of B-cell Siglecs and the interplay of ligand binding and signal inhibition. This review summarizes the role of CD22 and Siglec-G in regulating B-cell receptor signaling, membrane distribution with the importance of ligand binding, preventing autoimmunity and the role of CD22 beyond the naïve B-cell stage. Additionally, this review article features the long time discussed interaction between CD45 and CD22 with highlighting recent data, as well as the interplay between CD22 and Galectin-9 and its influence on B-cell receptor signaling. Moreover, therapeutical approaches targeting human CD22 will be elucidated.",Current State of Dendritic Cell-Based Immunotherapy: Opportunities for in vitro Antigen Loading of Different DC Subsets?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30559743,Frontiers in immunology,2018 12 20,"Dendritic cell (DC) based cancer immunotherapy aims at the activation of the immune system, and in particular tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) to eradicate the tumor. DCs represent a heterogeneous cell population, including conventional DCs (cDCs), consisting of cDC1s, cDC2s, plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs), and monocyte-derived DCs (moDCs). These DC subsets differ both in ontogeny and functional properties, such as the capacity to induce CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell activation. MoDCs are most frequently used for vaccination purposes, based on technical aspects such as availability and in vitro expansion. However, whether moDCs are superior over other DC subsets in inducing anti-tumor immune responses, is unknown, and likely depends on tumor type and composition of the tumor microenvironment. In this review, we discuss cellular aspects essential for DC vaccination efficacy, and the most recent findings on different DC subsets that could be used for DC-based cancer immunotherapy. This can prove valuable for the future design of more effective DC vaccines by choosing different DC subsets, and sheds light on the working mechanism of DC immunotherapy.",Disease Tolerance and Pathogen Resistance Genes May Underlie Trypanosoma cruzi Persistence and Differential Progression to Chagas Disease Cardiomyopathy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30559742,Frontiers in immunology,2018 12 21,"Chagas disease is caused by infection with the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi and affects over 8 million people worldwide. In spite of a powerful innate and adaptive immune response in acute infection, the parasite evades eradication, leading to a chronic persistent infection with low parasitism. Chronically infected subjects display differential patterns of disease progression. While 30% develop chronic Chagas disease cardiomyopathy (CCC)-a severe inflammatory dilated cardiomyopathy-decades after infection, 60% of the patients remain disease-free, in the asymptomatic/indeterminate (ASY) form, and 10% develop gastrointestinal disease. Infection of genetically deficient mice provided a map of genes relevant for resistance to T. cruzi infection, leading to the identification of multiple genes linked to survival to infection. These include pathogen resistance genes (PRG) needed for intracellular parasite destruction, and genes involved in disease tolerance (protection against tissue damage and acute phase death-DTG). All identified DTGs were found to directly or indirectly inhibit IFN-γ production or Th1 differentiation. We hypothesize that the absolute need for DTG to control potentially lethal IFN-γ PRG activity leads to T. cruzi persistence and establishment of chronic infection. IFN-γ production is higher in CCC than ASY patients, and is the most highly expressed cytokine in CCC hearts. Key DTGs that downmodulate IFN-γ, like IL-10, and Ebi3/IL27p28, are higher in ASY patients. Polymorphisms in PRG and DTG are associated with differential disease progression. We thus hypothesize that ASY patients are disease tolerant, while an imbalance of DTG and IFN-γ PRG activity leads to the inflammatory heart damage of CCC.",NLRX1 Facilitates Histoplasma capsulatum-Induced LC3-Associated Phagocytosis for Cytokine Production in Macrophages.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30559741,Frontiers in immunology,2018 12 21,"LC3-associated phagocytosis (LAP) is an emerging non-canonical autophagy process that bridges signaling from pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) to autophagic machinery. LAP formation results in incorporation of lipidated LC3 into phagosomal membrane (termed LAPosome). Increasing evidence reveals that LAP functions as an innate defense mechanism against fungal pathogens. However, the molecular mechanism involved and the consequence of LAP in regulating anti-fungal immune response remain largely unexplored. Here we show that Histoplasma capsulatum is taken into LAPosome upon phagocytosis by macrophages. Interaction of H. capsulatum with Dectin-1 activates Syk and triggers subsequent NADPH oxidase-mediated reactive oxygen species (ROS) response that is involved in LAP induction. Inhibiting LAP induction by silencing LC3α/β or treatment with ROS inhibitor impairs the activation of MAPKs-AP-1 pathway, thereby reduces macrophage proinflammatory cytokine response to H. capsulatum. Additionally, we unravel the importance of NLRX1 in fungus-induced LAP. NLRX1 facilitates LAP by interacting with TUFM which associates with autophagic proteins ATG5-ATG12 for LAPosome formation. Macrophages from Nlrx1-/- mice or TUFM-silenced cells exhibit reduced LAP induction and LAP-mediated MAPKs-AP-1 activation for cytokine response to H. capsulatum. Furthermore, inhibiting ROS production in Nlrx1-/- macrophages almost completely abolishes H. capsulatum-induced LC3 conversion, indicating that both Dectin-1/Syk/ROS-dependent pathway and NLRX1-TUFM complex-dependent pathway collaboratively contribute to LAP induction. Our findings reveal new pathways underlying LAP induction by H. capsulatum for macrophage cytokine response.",CAR T Cell Therapy of Non-hematopoietic Malignancies: Detours on the Road to Clinical Success.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30559740,Frontiers in immunology,2018 12 20,"Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-engineered T cells represent a breakthrough in personalized medicine. In this strategy, a patient's own T lymphocytes are genetically reprogrammed to encode a synthetic receptor that binds a tumor antigen, allowing T cells to recognize and kill antigen-expressing cancer cells. As a result of complete and durable responses in individuals who are refractory to standard of care therapy, CAR T cells directed against the CD19 protein have been granted United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval as a therapy for treatment of pediatric and young adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia and diffuse large B cell lymphoma. Human trials of CAR T cells targeting CD19 or B cell maturation antigen in multiple myeloma have also reported early successes. However, a clear and consistently reproducible demonstration of the clinical efficacy of CAR T cells in the setting of solid tumors has not been reported to date. Here, we review the history and status of CAR T cell therapy for solid tumors, potential T cell-intrinsic determinants of response and resistance as well as extrinsic obstacles to the success of this approach for much more prevalent non-hematopoietic malignancies. In addition, we summarize recent strategies and innovations that aim to augment the potency of CAR T cells in the face of multiple immunosuppressive barriers operative within the solid tumor microenvironment. Advances in the field of CAR T cell biology over the coming years in the areas of safety, reliability and efficacy against non-hematopoietic cancers will ultimately determine how transformative adoptive T cell therapy will be in the broader battle against cancer.",Hantavirus-Driven PD-L1/PD-L2 Upregulation: An Imperfect Viral Immune Evasion Mechanism.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30559738,Frontiers in immunology,2018 12 20,"Viruses often subvert antiviral immune responses by taking advantage of inhibitory immune signaling. We investigated if hantaviruses use this strategy. Hantaviruses cause viral hemorrhagic fever (VHF) which is associated with strong immune activation resulting in vigorous CD8+ T cell responses. Surprisingly, we observed that hantaviruses strongly upregulate PD-L1 and PD-L2, the ligands of checkpoint inhibitor programmed death-1 (PD-1). We detected high amounts of soluble PD-L1 (sPD-L1) and soluble PD-L2 (sPD-L2) in sera from hantavirus-infected patients. In addition, we observed hantavirus-induced PD-L1 upregulation in mice with a humanized immune system. The two major target cells of hantaviruses, endothelial cells and monocyte-derived dendritic cells, strongly increased PD-L1 and PD-L2 surface expression upon hantavirus infection in vitro. As an underlying mechanism, we found increased transcript levels whereas membrane trafficking of PD-L1 was not affected. Further analysis revealed that hantavirus-associated inflammatory signals and hantaviral nucleocapsid (N) protein enhance PD-L1 and PD-L2 expression. Cell numbers were strongly reduced when hantavirus-infected endothelial cells were mixed with T cells in the presence of an exogenous proliferation signal compared to uninfected cells. This is compatible with the concept that virus-induced PD-L1 and PD-L2 upregulation contributes to viral immune escape. Intriguingly, however, we observed hantavirus-induced CD8+ T cell bystander activation despite strongly upregulated PD-L1 and PD-L2. This result indicates that hantavirus-induced CD8+ T cell bystander activation bypasses checkpoint inhibition allowing an early antiviral immune response upon virus infection.","Viral Diversity and Its Relationship With Environmental Factors at the Surface and Deep Sea of Prydz Bay, Antarctica.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30559737,Frontiers in microbiology,2018 12 20,"A viral metagenomic analysis of five surface and two bottom water (878 meters below surface, mbs, and 3,357 mbs) samples from Prydz Bay, was conducted during February-March 2015. The results demonstrated that most of the DNA viruses were dsDNA viruses (79.73-94.06%, except at PBI1, 37.51%). Of these, Caudovirales (Siphoviridae, Myoviridae, and Podoviridae) phages were most abundant in surface seawater (67.67-71.99%), while nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses (NCLDVs) (Phycodnaviridae, Mimiviridae, and Pandoraviridae accounted for >30% of dsDNA viruses) were most abundant in the bottom water (3,357 mbs). Of the ssDNA viruses, Microviridae was the dominant family in PBI2, PBI3, PBOs, and PBI4b (57.09-87.55%), while Inoviridae (58.16%) was the dominant family in PBI1. Cellulophaga phages (phi38:1 and phi10:1) and Flavobacterium phage 11b, infecting the possible host strains affiliated with the family Flavobacteriaceae of the phylum Bacteroidetes, were abundant in surface water dsDNA viromes. The long contig (PBI2_1_C) from the viral metagenomes were most similar to the genome architectures of Cellulophaga phage phi10:1 and Flavobacterium phage 11b from the Arctic Ocean. Comparative analysis showed that the surface viral community of Prydz Bay could be clearly separated from other marine and freshwater environments. The deep sea viral community was similar to the deep sea viral metagenome at A Long-term Oligotrophic Habitat Assessment Station (ALOHA, at 22°45'N, 158°00'W). The multivariable analysis indicated that nutrients probably played an important role in shaping the local viral community structure. This study revealed the preliminary characteristics of the viral community in Prydz Bay, from both the surface and the deep sea. It provided evidence of the relationships between the virome and the environment in Prydz Bay and provided the first data from the deep sea viral community of the Southern Ocean.",Theileria annulata Cyclophilin1 (TaCyp1) Interacts With Host Cell MED21.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30559736,Frontiers in microbiology,2018 12 20,"Host cells infected by Theileria annulata schizonts show the character of permanent proliferation in vitro, also named transformation. To explore the molecular mechanism a T. annulata Cyp1 (TaCyp1) protein potentially involved in regulating cell transformation was used as bait to screen for its interacting proteins by yeast-two-hybrid assay. Additional GST-pull down experiments confirmed that only MED21 specifically interacted with TaCyp1. Moreover, the distribution of TaCyp1 around T. annulata schizonts facilitated interaction with host cell MED21. As a component of mediator complex, MED21 is normally involved in regulating the transcription of nearly all RNA polymerase II-dependent genes. Therefore, to explore its influence on NF-κB signaling MED21 RNA interference and parasite killing with BW720c treatment were performed. Knock down of MED21 resulted in a significant decrease in NF-κB1/2 mRNA expressions, but no significant change in P105, P52 levels, nor detectable alteration in levels of phosphorylated IκBα/β. By contrast, BW720c treatment induced an obvious decrease in the phosphorylation status of P52 and IκBα/β, but no obvious change in that of P105. This suggests that BW720c-induced parasite death had a significant negative influence on NF-κB signaling, whereas knock down of MED21 had no obvious effect on NF-κB signaling. Characterization of TaCyp1 provides information on the function of parasite cyclophilins and leads to a better understanding of the interactions between T. annulata and its host leukocytes."

A strain of E. coli, EC11, which is resistant to colistin, polymyxin B and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, was isolated in 2016 from the feces of a dairy cow in Shanghai, China. Strain EC11 identifies with sequence type ST278 and is susceptible to 19 frequently used antibiotics. Whole genome sequencing of strain EC11 showed that this strain contains a 31-kb resistance plasmid, pEC11b, which belongs to the IncX4 group. The mcr-1 gene was shown to be inserted into a 2.6-kb mcr-1-pap2 cassette of pEC11b. Plasmid pEC11b also contained putative conjugal transfer components, including an oriT-like region, relaxase, type IV coupling protein, and type IV secretion system. We were successful in transferring pEC11b to E. coli C600 with an average transconjugation efficiency of 4.6 × 10-5. Additionally, a MLST-based analysis comparing EC11 and other reported mcr-positive E. coli populations showed high genotypic diversity. The discovery of the E. coli strain EC11 with resistance to colistin in Shanghai emphasizes the importance of vigilance in detecting new threats like mcr genes to public health. Detection of mcr genes helps in tracking, slowing, and responding to the emergence of antibiotic resistance in Chinese livestock farming.",Diversity of Iron Oxidizers in Groundwater-Fed Rapid Sand Filters: Evidence of Fe(II)-Dependent Growth by Curvibacter and Undibacterium spp.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30559723,Frontiers in microbiology,2018 12 20,"Although earlier circumstantial observations have suggested the presence of iron oxidizing bacteria (IOB) in groundwater-fed rapid sand filters (RSF), ferrous iron (Fe(II)) oxidation in this environment is often considered a chemical process due to the highly oxic and circumneutral pH conditions. The low water temperature (5-10°C), typical of groundwaters, on the other hand, may reduce the rates of chemical Fe(II) oxidation, which may allow IOB to grow and compete with chemical Fe(II) oxidation. Hence, we hypothesized that IOB are active and abundant in groundwater-fed RSFs. Here, we applied a combination of cultivation and molecular approaches to isolate, quantify, and confirm the growth of IOB from groundwater-fed RSFs, operated at different influent Fe(II) concentrations. Isolates related to Undibacterium and Curvibacter were identified as novel IOB lineages. Gallionella spp. were dominant in all waterworks, whereas Ferriphaselus and Undibacterium were dominant at pre-filters of waterworks receiving groundwaters with high (>2 mg/l) Fe(II) concentrations. The high density and diversity of IOB in groundwater-fed RSFs suggest that neutrophilic IOB may not be limited to oxic/anoxic interfaces.",The Pathology of Hyperthyroidism.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30559722,Frontiers in endocrinology,2018 12 20,"This article reviews those pathologic lesions which are associated with clinical and/or biochemical hyperthyroidism. Beginning with the descriptive pathology of classical Graves' disease and the less common toxic nodular goiter and hyper-functioning thyroid nodules, this paper describes the effects of non-thyroidal hormones, glandular function (including pituitary and hypothalamic lesions), ectopic production of thyroid stimulating proteins by non-thyroidal neoplasms, exogenous drug reactions causing hyper-function and finally conditions associated with a mechanic- destructive cause of hyperthyroidism.",Genotype Is Associated to the Degree of Virilization in Patients With Classic Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30559721,Frontiers in endocrinology,2018 12 20,"Background: Molecular defects of CYP21A2 consistently decrease 21-hydroxylase activity and result in a variable expression of disease severity in patients with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). Aim: The genotype and biochemical findings were examined in an attempt to reveal any association to the degree of virilization in classic CAH patients. Methods: The study included 18 CAH patients with complete characterization of CYP21A2 mutations and were sorted based on the severity of the inherited mutations and the expected percentage of 21-hydroxylase enzyme activity. Results: Eleven out of the 18 patients manifested the SW form with the remaining seven exhibiting the SV form. The most frequent genetic defect in the classic salt-wasting (SW) and simple virilising (SV) forms was the IVS2-13A/C>G (36.1%) mutation, followed by delEX1-3 (19.4%) and p.Ile172Asn (19.4%). Four patients, who shared a combination of two mutations belonging to the most severe type, manifested only the SW form. Four out of five patients who shared homozygosity in the IVS2-13A/C>G mutation, demonstrated the SW form and only one demonstrated the SV form. All four patients who shared the p.Ile172Asn mutation, either in the homozygous or compound heterozygous state, manifested the SV form. Interestingly, a female neonate with SW, bearing the IVS2-13A/C>G/Large del, exhibited complete male virilisation (Prader 5). The remaining four affected female new-borns also exhibited the SW form, with two of them virilised as Prader 3 and the other two as Prader 4. Virilisation with clitoromegaly was also observed in one female, who presented premature adrenarche and carried the least severe p.Pro30Leu mutation. Conclusion: The frequency of the underlying mutations in our patients, with the classic form of CAH, varies but were quite similar to the ones reported in the Mediterranean region. Therefore, the identification of severe CYP21A2 defects in Cypriot patients and their comparison with the incidence and severity in different populations, will create a valuable diagnostic tool for genetic counseling in the classic form of CAH.",Physical Exercise and Its Protective Effects on Diabetic Cardiomyopathy: What Is the Evidence?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30559720,Frontiers in endocrinology,2018 12 20,"As one of the most serious complications of diabetes, diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) imposes a huge burden on individuals and society, and represents a major public health problem. It has long been recognized that physical exercise has important health benefits for patients with type 2 diabetes, and regular physical exercise can delay or prevent the complications of diabetes. Current studies show that physical exercise has been regarded as an importantly non-pharmacological treatment for diabetes and DCM, with high efficacy and low adverse events. It can inhibit the pathological processes of myocardial apoptosis, myocardial fibrosis, and myocardial microvascular diseases through improving myocardial metabolism, enhancing the regulation of Ca2+, and protecting the function of mitochondria. Eventually, it can alleviate the occurrence and development of diabetic complications. Describing the mechanisms of physical exercise on DCM may provide a new theory for alleviating, or even reversing the development of DCM, and prevent it from developing to heart failure.","Distinctive Roles of Sirtuins on Diabetes, Protective or Detrimental?",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30559718,Frontiers in endocrinology,2018 12 20,"Dysregulation of metabolic pathways leads to type 2 diabetes, characteristic of high glucose concentration caused by insulin resistance. The histone deacetylases sirtuins exhibit remarkable enzymatic activities. Accumulating evidence indicates that sirtuins can be pharmacologically activated to ameliorate diabetes. Here, we evaluated different roles of sirtuins (SIRT1-SIRT7) in diabetes progression and described their involvement in metabolic pathways of skeletal muscle, adipose tissue and liver. The nuclear sirtuins, SIRT1, SIRT6, and SIRT7, regulate the activity of key transcription factors and cofactors in almost all tissues with the cellular responses to energy demands. The mitochondrial sirtuins, SIRT3, SIRT4, and SIRT5, regulate the activity of mitochondrial enzymes in response to fasting and calorie restriction. Moreover, genetic polymorphisms of SIRT1 and SIRT2 have been reported to associate with diabetes development. It's worth noting that SIRT1, SIRT2, SIRT3, and SIRT6 are positive regulators of insulin resistance in most cases. In the opposite, SIRT4 and SIRT7 inhibit insulin secretion and fatty acid oxidation. Identification of SIRT1 activators for diabetes has gained wide attention, such as metformin, resveratrol, and resveratrol derivatives. Randomized, prospective, and large-scale clinical trials are warrant to uncover the responsibilities of SIRTs modulators on diabetes progress.",Thermal Modulation of Monoamine Levels Influence Fish Stress and Welfare.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30559717,Frontiers in endocrinology,2018 12 20,"Fish are ectotherm organisms that move through different thermal zones according to their physiological requirements and environmental availability, a behavior known as thermoregulation. Thermoregulation in ectothermic animals is influenced by their ability to effectively respond to thermal variations. While it is known that ectotherms are affected by thermal changes, it remains unknown how physiological and/or metabolic traits are impacted by modifications in the thermal environment. In captivity (land-based infrastructures or nets located in the open sea), fish are often restricted to spatially constant temperature conditions within the containment unit and cannot choose among different thermal conditions for thermoregulation. In order to understand how spatial variation of temperature may affect fish welfare and stress, we designed an experiment using either restricted or wide thermal ranges, looking for changes at hormonal and molecular levels. Also, thermal variability impact on fish behavior was measured. Our results showed that in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), a wide thermal range (ΔT 6.8°C) was associated with significant increases in monoamines hormone levels and in the expression of clock genes. Aggressive and territoriality behavior decreased, positively affecting parameters linked to welfare, such as growth and fin damage. In contrast, a restricted thermal range (ΔT 1.4°C) showed the opposite pattern in all the analyzed parameters, therefore, having detrimental effects on welfare. In conclusion, our results highlight the key role of thermal range amplitude on fish behavior and on interactions with major metabolism-regulating processes, such as hormone performance and molecular regulatory mechanisms that have positive effects on the welfare.",Impacts of Diet and Exercise on Maternal Gut Microbiota Are Transferred to Offspring.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30559716,Frontiers in endocrinology,2018 12 20,"Background: It is well established that maternal exercise during pregnancy improves metabolic outcomes associated with obesity in mothers and offspring, however, its effects on the gut microbiota of both mother and offspring, are unknown. Here, we investigated whether wheel running exercise prior to and during pregnancy and prolonged feeding of an obesogenic diet were associated with changes in the gut microbiomes of Sprague-Dawley rat dams and their offspring. Female rats were fed either chow or obesogenic diet, and half of each diet group were given access to a running wheel 10 days before mating until delivery, while others remained sedentary. 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing was used to assess gut microbial communities in dams and their male and female offspring around the time of weaning. Results: Statistical analyses at the operational taxonomic unit (OTU) level revealed that maternal obesogenic diet decreased gut microbial alpha diversity and altered abundances of bacterial taxa previously associated with obesity such as Bacteroides and Blautia in dams, and their offspring of both sexes. Distance based linear modeling revealed that the relative abundances of Bacteroides OTUs were associated with adiposity measures in both dams and offspring. We identified no marked effects of maternal exercise on the gut microbiota of obesogenic diet dams or their offspring. In contrast, maternal exercise decreased gut microbial alpha diversity and altered the abundance of 88 microbial taxa in offspring of control dams. Thirty of these taxa were altered in a similar direction in offspring of sedentary obesogenic vs. control diet dams. In particular, the relative abundances of Oscillibacter OTUs were decreased in offspring of both exercised control dams and sedentary obesogenic diet dams, and associated with blood glucose concentrations and adiposity measures. Analyses of predicted bacterial metabolic pathways inferred decreased indole alkaloid biosynthesis in offspring of both obesogenic diet and exercised control dams. Conclusions: Our data suggest that maternal exercise prior to and during pregnancy resulted in gut dysbiosis in offspring of control dams. Importantly, alterations in the maternal gut microbiota by obesogenic diet or obesity were transferred to their offspring.",Assessing the Impact of Excessive Gestational Weight Gain Among Women With Type 1 Diabetes on Overweight/Obesity in Their Adolescent and Young Adult Offspring: A Pilot Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30559715,Frontiers in endocrinology,2018 12 21,"Aims/hypothesis: We sought to determine the impact of intrauterine exposure to excessive gestational weight gain (GWG) on overweight/obesity in adolescent/young adult offspring of women with type 1 diabetes mellitus (TIDM). Methods: In 2008, a pilot study was conducted among 19 randomly-selected adolescent and adult offspring of mothers with TIDM who participated in the Diabetes in Pregnancy Program Project (DiP) between 1978 and 1995. Body mass index (BMI)-specific Institute of Medicine (IOM) guidelines for gestational weight gain (GWG) were defined as: 12.5-18.0 kilograms (kg) GWG; 11.5-16.0 kg GWG: 7.0-11.5 kg GWG; 5.0-9.0 kg GWG, for women classed as underweight, normal, overweight and obese according to pre-pregnancy BMI, respectively. Generalized estimating equations were used to estimate adjusted odds ratios (aOR, [95% confidence intervals, CI]) for overweight/obesity among offspring, related to IOM adherence, adjusting for pre-pregnancy BMI and mean maternal daily insulin units/kg body weight. Results: Mean age of offspring at follow-up was 20.3 ± 3.3 years, 12(63%) were male, 4(21%) Black and 12(63%) overweight/obese. There were 9(82%) overweight/obese offspring among the 11 mothers who exceeded IOM guidelines for GWG compared with 3(38%) overweight/obese offspring among the 8 mothers with GWG within guidelines. Exceeding vs. adhering to IOM guidelines (OR = 7.50, [95%CI: 0.92-61.0]) and GWG per kilogram (OR = 1.39, [95%CI: 0.98-1.97]) were associated with offspring overweight/obesity at follow-up. Conclusions/interpretation: Our pilot study suggests potential long-term implications of excessive GWG on metabolic health in offspring of mothers with TIDM, warranting future research examining the health impact of GWG in this population.",Aging Is a Risk Factor for Utricular Dysfunction in Idiopathic Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30559714,Frontiers in neurology,2018 12 20,"Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is the most common cause of balance disorders in the elderly. Dislodgement of the otoconia in BPPV might have an association with damage to the otolith organs. The aim of this study was to investigate whether aging is a risk factor for otolith organ dysfunction in idiopathic BPPV. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 112 consecutive idiopathic BPPV patients who underwent cervical VEMP testing to air-conducted sound (ACS cVEMP), ocular VEMP testing to bone-conducted vibration (BCV oVEMP), and caloric testing. We performed binomial logistic regression analyses to see whether age, the side affected by BPPV or the canal affected by BPPV have an association with the presence of peripheral vestibular dysfunction in idiopathic BPPV patients. The elderly group (aged ≥65 years) had a significantly positive association with abnormalities in BCV oVEMPs (p = 0.0109), while the side affected by BPPV (p = 0.598) and the canal affected by BPPV (p = 0.576) did not. The odds ratio of the abnormal BCV oVEMPs for the elderly group compared with the non-elderly group (aged < 65 years) was 2.676 (95% confidence interval, 1.254-5.079). The elderly group had no significant association with the abnormalities in ACS cVEMPs (p = 0.0955) or caloric testing (p = 0.488). Dysfunction of the utricle, where the dislodgement of the otoconia mainly occurs, is affected by aging in idiopathic BPPV."

It has been argued that the motor system is involved in perception and action, playing a fundamental role in the handling of actions produced by oneself and by others. But how does it distinguish in this processing between self and other, thus contributing to self-other distinction? In this paper we propose a hierarchical model of sensorimotor coordination based on principles of perception-action coupling and predictive processing in which self-other distinction arises during action and perception. For this we draw on mechanisms assumed for the integration of cues for a sense of agency, i.e., the sense that an action is self-generated. We report results from simulations of different scenarios, showing that the model is not only able to minimize free energy during perception and action, but also showing that the model can correctly attribute sense of agency to own actions.",Design and Validation of an Observational Instrument for the Technical-Tactical Actions in Singles Tennis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30559702,Frontiers in psychology,2018 12 20,"The competitive performance in tennis practice is determined by the effectiveness of technical tactical action. The main objective of the present study was to design and validate an observational instrument with the aim of analysing the technical-tactical in singles tennis. The instrument uses the stroke as a unit of measure, so that each time a player hits a ball, a total of 23 variables are analyzed. The variables collect information about: (a) matching context; (b) result; and (c) technical-tactical information of the stroke (five variables: sequences of the stroke of the point, kind of technical and tactical stroke, bounce area, hitting, and effectiveness area). The design and validation of the instrument consisted on five different stages: (a) review of the scientific literature and variables definition by experts, (b) pilot observation study, (c) qualitative and quantitative assessment of the instrument by experts, (d) review and confirmation of the instrument by experts (content validity), and (e) observation training and reliability evaluation. From 23 expert judges, divided into three panels, and four observers the instrument went from being composed of 38 variables (eight contextual, seven related to the result and 23 related to the game) to 23 (eight contextual variables, 10 of result and five of game), with minimum Aikens's V values of 0.94 and reliability of 0.81.

A unique duality characterizes this context: academics cannot be longer defined as stress-free, but at the same time they are still satisfied and engaged in their work. There is a need to evaluate the academic environment not only in terms of stressor and strain, but also in terms of which experiences are sources of fulfillment. The study aimed to explore psychometric properties of a new instrument (AQoLW) for assessing context-specific features of the academic work and environment that characterized academics' quality of life at work. Method: A 24 item scale was deployed to academics (full, associate, and assistant professors) in a public university in the north of Italy. Items were defined to represent the main academic activities in order to measure if respondents perceived each of it as a challenging or a hindrance demand. The scale was administered online to 1,012 academics, 443 females (48.7%), mean aged 51.1 years (SD = 8.2). In order to test three theoretical models underling AQoLW, a training sample was randomly extracted (242 participants) and analyzed using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). A validation sample with the remaining 668 participants was used to test the measurement invariance by role of the best model emerging from the training sample. Results: Model fit demonstrate the goodness of a latent structure composed by five intercorrelated factors (CFI = 0.91, RMSEA = 0.08, SRMR = 0.07). Cronbach α of the five subscales was good, ranging from 0.76 to 0.88. The scale overtakes configural invariance, but not strong invariance by role. Conclusions: The scale is able to intercept the mainly dimensions of the academic work that contribute to the quality of life of academics' staff, namely: research and public engagement, didactic work and relationships with students, career development and competition, ordinary obligations, and fund raising. AQoLW is the first tool to evaluate the academic work and its environment, identifying which activities are stressful demands and which are engaging, and promote scholars' satisfaction.",Factor Analysis of EMA-Scale on Adolescent Adjustment From a Developmental Perspective: A Short Form.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30559698,Frontiers in psychology,2018 12 20,"Many published instruments for assessing adolescent adjustment can be implemented in the school context. However, most of them fail to include a comprehensive and positive theoretical perspective of adolescent development and, even when they do, priority is often given to the clinical perspective, or problems with ecological validity and cost-effectiveness emerge. The Magallanes Adaptation Scale is a 90-item Likert-instrument designed for Spanish-speaking adolescents in order to screen several adjustment areas from a holistic and positive perspective of development. Although some evidence of its psychometric robustness has been tested, no confirmatory analysis of its structure has been published. This paper analyzes the items and the factor structure (exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis, using the split-half method) of the scales. Participants were 948 Spanish adolescents (49.84% girls) aged between 11 and 17 and stratified sampled. Thirty-six items were removed from the item analysis. The results of the exploratory factor analysis revealed five factors, excluding mother's adaptation. Several models were tested during the confirmatory factor analyses, with a 24-item second-order four-factor solution being found to have the best adjustment indicators. The short version proposed in this paper can constitute a helpful tool with screening purposes to help school teachers to assess students' overall development beyond mere academic performance, although further validity research is needed.",Input and Processing Factors Affecting Infants' Vocabulary Size at 19 and 25 Months.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30559696,Frontiers in psychology,2018 12 21,"This study examined the relative contributions of three factors to individual differences in vocabulary development: the acoustic quality of mothers' speech, the quantity of mothers' speech, and infants' ability to recognize words.

Infants' ability to recognize words was gauged by their performance in a perception experiment at 19 months. We examined the relationship between these measures and infants' vocabulary size at 19 and 25 months. The quantity of mothers' speech accounted for the greatest amount of variance in infants' vocabulary size at 19 months; infants' ability to recognize words followed next. At 25 months, when mothers' speech alone is presumably no longer the primary input for infants, infants' ability to recognize words at 19 months was a better predictor of vocabulary size. The acoustic quality of mothers' speech was not correlated with infants' vocabulary size at either age. The findings highlight the importance of considering multiple factors that contribute to early word learning, providing a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying the facilitation process.",On the Existential Road From Regret to Heroism: Searching for Meaning in Life.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30559695,Frontiers in psychology,2018 12 20,"We investigated whether regret predicted the motivation to act heroically. In a series of studies, we examined the relationship between regret, search for meaning in life, and heroism motivation. First, Study 1 (a and b) investigated the association between regret and search for meaning in life, considering regret as a whole, action regret, and inaction regret. As expected, regret correlated positively with search for meaning in life. In two additional studies (Study 2 and 3), we examined whether regret predicted heroism motivation and whether this effect was mediated through search for meaning in life. Study 2 confirmed this hypothesis for individual differences in regret, using a correlational design. Study 3 confirmed the hypothesis for temporary experiences of regret, using an experimental design. In addition, in Study 3 we found that heroism motivation was stronger for people with high self-enhancement needs than for those with lower self-enhancement needs. We discuss the relationship between regret and heroism in light of these results and explore their implications.",Contingencies of Self-Worth on Positive and Negative Events and Their Relationships to Depression.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30559694,Frontiers in psychology,2018 12 20,"Previous studies have found that the relationship between contingencies of self-worth (CSW) and depression was generally weak. We posited that this is partly because previous studies assumed CSW on positive and negative events as the same construct (one-dimensional CSW), which should be better conceptualized as two distinctive dimensions (two-dimensional CSW) in explaining depression. A total of 393 undergraduates from Taiwan completed the measures regarding one-dimensional CSW, two-dimensional CSW, and depression. After dividing CSW of seven classic domains into two dimensions of positive and negative CSW, the results of confirmatory factor analyses showed that the two-dimensional CSW model had better model fit than the one-dimensional model in all domains. Furthermore, relative to using one-dimensional CSW as a predictor of depression, the variance accounted for largely increased when positive and negative CSW entered simultaneously in the regression equation. The results suggest that CSW on positive and negative events should be seen as two dimensions and this perspective may largely increase the explanatory power of CSW in explaining mental health.",Motivational Regulations Across the Stages of Change for Exercise in the General Population of Monterrey (Mexico).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30559693,Frontiers in psychology,2018 12 20,"Few studies have examined exercise adherence in the Mexican population using self-determination theory proposals and the stages of change model. The objectives of this study were:(a) to translate and adapt the Behavioral Regulation in Exercise Questionnaire-3 (BREQ-3) to Mexican Spanish and examine its internal consistency and factorial structure (six dimensions); and (b) to analyse variations in behavioral regulations using the stages of change model. This study included 530 participants between 11 and 76 years old who lived in the metropolitan area of the city of Monterrey, Nuevo Leon, Mexico. The Mexican version of the BREQ-3 presented an acceptable six-factor model that agrees with the theory and has good internal consistency. Results showed that the less self-determined regulations (i.e., external and amotivation) predominated in the first stages of change (i.e., pre-contemplation and contemplation) and decreased in the last stages (i.e., action and maintenance); by contrast, the more self-determined regulations (i.e., intrinsic, integrated, and identified) predominated in the last stages (i.e., action and maintenance) and were lower in the first stages (i.e., pre-contemplation and contemplation). Linking these two theoretical constructs contributes to understanding physical exercise adherence.",Relation Between Awe and Environmentalism: The Role of Social Dominance Orientation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30559692,Frontiers in psychology,2018 12 20,"The present study attempts to explore the effect of awe on environmentalism and the mediating role of social dominance orientation in generating this effect. In Study 1, a series of questionnaires were used to investigate the correlation among trait awe, social dominance orientation, and ecological behavior. Results demonstrated that, while trait awe was positively correlated with ecological behavior, it was partially mediated by social dominance orientation. In follow-up studies, two priming experiments were conducted to test the causal relationship and the psychological mechanisms between awe and environmentalism. Results revealed that inductions of awe (relative to various control states) decreased participants' social dominance orientation, which in turn partially enhanced their willingness to make personal sacrifices for the environment (Study 2), and intentions to engage in pro-environmental behavior (Study 3). This study not only corroborates the critical role of awe in promoting environmentalism, but also highlights the importance of social dominance orientation in explaining why awe increases environmentalism. Implications and future directions were also discussed.",The Assertive Resolution of Conflicts in School With a Gamified Emotion Education Program.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30559691,Frontiers in psychology,2018 12 20,"Coexistence in schools inevitably carries a higher risk of conflicts among peers. This fact can be detrimental to the well-being and academic achievement of the students. In many developed countries, about 90% of the pupils in compulsory secondary education report witnessing assaults among peers. In this regard, recognizing, controlling and managing emotions is key to ensure a healthy and effective interaction with others. Negative emotions, such as anger, can trigger conflicts or even episodes of violence if not regulated properly. Interactive tools, such as specialized software's, have shown high rates of efficacy for the training of different kinds of competences like the regulation of emotions. The aim of the present work is to describe the Happy Emotional Education Program and its effects over a sample of secondary school students. This software focuses in the training of emotional competences of the students with the objective of solving conflicts in a more assertive way. The design employed in the present work was a quasiexperimental design with pretest and posttest with a control group. Results show that Happy Emotional Education Program contributes to the management of emotions and the absence of negative affect or anxiety in a significant way. Additionally, the constant use of this interactive tool enhances motivation and the learning process of students. Results also indicate the importance of assessing the effects of the program in the long term. This would enable researchers to further assess the effects of the program over those emotional competences that are more resistant to change given its stable nature."

Recent research efforts have been devoted to the reliable and fast generation of forward models. However, these model can suffer from several sources of inaccuracy, which in turn can lead to considerable error in both the forward simulation of body surface potentials and even more so for ECGI solutions. In particular, the accurate localization of the heart within the torso is sensitive to movements due to respiration and changes in position of the subject, a problem that cannot be resolved with better imaging and segmentation alone. Here, we propose an algorithm to localize the position of the heart using electrocardiographic recordings on both the heart and torso surface over a sequence of cardiac cycles. We leverage the dependency of electrocardiographic forward models on the underlying geometry to parameterize the forward model with respect to the position (translation) and orientation of the heart, and then estimate these parameters from heart and body surface potentials in a numerical inverse problem. We show that this approach is capable of localizing the position of the heart in synthetic experiments and that it reduces the modeling error in the forward models and resulting inverse solutions in canine experiments. Our results show a consistent decrease in error of both simulated body surface potentials and inverse reconstructed heart surface potentials after re-localizing the heart based on our estimated geometric correction. These results suggest that this method is capable of improving electrocardiographic models used in research settings and suggest the basis for the extension of the model presented here to its application in a purely inverse setting, where the heart potentials are unknown.",Competing Mechanisms of Stress-Assisted Diffusivity and Stretch-Activated Currents in Cardiac Electromechanics.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30559677,Frontiers in physiology,2018 12 20,"We numerically investigate the role of mechanical stress in modifying the conductivity properties of cardiac tissue, and also assess the impact of these effects in the solutions generated by computational models for cardiac electromechanics. We follow the recent theoretical framework from Cherubini et al. (2017), proposed in the context of general reaction-diffusion-mechanics systems emerging from multiphysics continuum mechanics and finite elasticity. In the present study, the adapted models are compared against preliminary experimental data of pig right ventricle fluorescence optical mapping. These data contribute to the characterization of the observed inhomogeneity and anisotropy properties that result from mechanical deformation. Our novel approach simultaneously incorporates two mechanisms for mechano-electric feedback (MEF): stretch-activated currents (SAC) and stress-assisted diffusion (SAD); and we also identify their influence into the nonlinear spatiotemporal dynamics. It is found that (i) only specific combinations of the two MEF effects allow proper conduction velocity measurement; (ii) expected heterogeneities and anisotropies are obtained via the novel stress-assisted diffusion mechanisms; (iii) spiral wave meandering and drifting is highly mediated by the applied mechanical loading. We provide an analysis of the intrinsic structure of the nonlinear coupling mechanisms using computational tests conducted with finite element methods. In particular, we compare static and dynamic deformation regimes in the onset of cardiac arrhythmias and address other potential biomedical applications.","High Intensity Jump Exercise Preserves Posture Control, Gait, and Functional Mobility During 60 Days of Bed-Rest: An RCT Including 90 Days of Follow-Up.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30559676,Frontiers in physiology,2018 12 20,"Physical inactivity causes a deconditioning of the human body. Concerns due to chronic bed-rest include deficits in posture and gait control, predisposing individuals to an increased fall and injury risk. This study assessed the efficiency of a high-load jump exercise (JUMP) as a countermeasure to prevent detrimental effects on gait, posture control and functional mobility. In an RCT (23 males), the effect of 60 days bed-rest without training was compared to JUMP. JUMP is characterized by plyometric executed as a high intensity interval training. Typical trainings session consisted of 4 × 10 countermovement jumps and 2 × 10 hops in a sledge jump system. We assessed sway path and muscle activity in monopedal stance, spatiotemporal, kinematic, and variability characteristics in gait, functional mobility with repeated chair-rises and Timed Up and Go (TUG). Results revealed: The JUMP group showed no significant changes after bed-rest, whereas the control group exhibited substantial deteriorations: an increased sway path (+104%, p < 0.05) was accompanied by increased co-contractions of antagonistic muscles encompassing the ankle (+32%, p < 0.05) and knee joint (45%, p < 0.05). A reduced locomotor speed (-22%, p < 0.05) was found concomitant with pathological gait rhythmicity (p < 0.05), reduced joint excursions (ankle -8%, knee -29%, p < 0.05) and an increased gait variability (p < 0.05). Chair-rising was slowed (+28%, p < 0.05) with reduced peak power (+18%, p < 0.05), and more time was needed to accomplish TUG (+39%, p < 0.05). The effects persisted for a period of 1 month after bed-rest. Increases in sway path were correlated to decreases in gait speed. The JUMP effectively preserved the neuromuscular system's ability to safely control postural equilibrium and perform complex locomotor movements, including fast bipedal gait with turns and rises. We therefore recommend JUMP as an appropriate strategy combatting functional deconditioning.",Lipid Transporter Activity-Related Genetic Polymorphisms Are Associated With Steroid-Induced Osteonecrosis of the Femoral Head: An Updated Meta-Analysis Based on the GRADE Guidelines.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30559675,Frontiers in physiology,2018 12 20,"Aims: The purpose of this study was to assess the relationship between genetic variants and steroid-induced osteonecrosis of the femoral head (SONFH) in steroid use populations. Methods: We searched the public databases up to April 15, 2018. This study analyzed only the single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that have appeared in more than three studies and assessed the level of evidence by classifying the outcomes according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Results: The ABCB1 rs1045642 C>T mutation had a protective effect against SONFH in the allelic model (I2 = 50.2%; OR: 0.74; 95% CI: 0.55-1.00; p = 0.046). The rs2032582 mutation in the ABCB1 gene showed no relationship to SONFH (allelic model: I2 = 63.4%; OR: 0.85; 95% CI: 0.58-1.23; p = 0.382). In ApoB rs693, four models showed that mutations can increase SONFH risk, but the allelic model did not. The ApoB rs1042031 mutation increased SONFH risk in the dominant model (I2 = 50.3%; OR: 2.90; 95% CI: 1.49-5.66; p = 0.002). Conclusion: An allelic model of ABCB1 rs1045642 showed that mutations have a protective effect against SONFH at a very low level of evidence. The mutations in ApoB rs693 and rs1042031 increase the SONFH risk with moderate levels of evidence.",Motor Unit Properties of the First Dorsal Interosseous in Chronic Stroke Subjects: Concentric Needle and Single Fiber EMG Analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30559674,Frontiers in physiology,2018 12 21,"The purpose of this study was to better understand changes in motor unit electrophysiological properties in people with chronic stroke based on concentric needle electromyography (EMG) and single fiber EMG recordings. The first dorsal interosseous (FDI) muscle was studied bilaterally in eleven hemiparetic stroke subjects. A significant increase in mean fiber density (FD) was found in the paretic muscle compared with the contralateral side based on single fiber EMG (1.6 ± 0.2 vs. 1.3 ± 0.1, respectively, P = 0.003). There was no statistically significant difference between the paretic and contralateral sides in most concentric needle motor unit action potential (MUAP) parameters, such as amplitude (768.7 ± 441.7 vs. 855.0 ± 289.9 μV), duration (8.9 ± 1.8 vs. 8.68 ± 0.9 ms) and size index (1.2 ± 0.5 vs. 1.1 ± 0.3) (P > 0.18), nor was there a significant difference in single fiber EMG recorded jitter (37.0 ± 9.6 vs. 39.9 ± 10.6 μs, P = 0.45). The increase in FD suggests motor units of the paretic FDI have enlarged due to collateral reinnervation. However, sprouting might be insufficient to result in a statistically significant change in the concentric needle MUAP parameters. Single fiber EMG appears more sensitive than concentric needle EMG to reflect electrophysiological changes in motor units after stroke. Both single fiber and concentric needle EMG recordings may be necessary to better understand muscle changes after stroke, which is important for development of appropriate rehabilitation strategies. The results provide further evidence that motor units are remodeled after stroke, possibly in response to a loss of motoneurons.",The Cholinergic Pathways in Inflammation: A Potential Pharmacotherapeutic Target for COPD.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30559673,Frontiers in pharmacology,2018 12 20,"In COPD, the activity of the cholinergic system is increased, which is one of the reasons for the airflow limitation caused by the contraction of airway smooth muscles. Therefore, blocking the contractive actions with anticholinergics is a useful therapeutic intervention to reduce the airflow limitation. In addition to the effects of bronchoconstriction and mucus secretion, accumulating evidence from animal models of COPD suggest acetylcholine has a role in inflammation. Experiments using muscarinic M3-receptor deficient mice or M3 selective antagonists revealed that M3-receptors on parenchymal cells, but not on hematopoietic cells, are involved in the pro-inflammatory effect of acetylcholine. Recently, combinations of long-acting β2 adrenergic agonists (LABAs) and long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs) have become available for COPD treatment. These dual long-acting bronchodilators may have synergistic anti-inflammatory effects because stimulation of β2 adrenergic receptors induces inhibitory effects in inflammatory cells via a different signaling pathway from that by antagonizing M3-receptor, though these anti-inflammatory effects have not been clearly demonstrated in COPD patients. In contrast to the pro-inflammatory effects by ACh via muscarinic receptors, it has been demonstrated that the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway, which involves the parasympathetic nervous systems, regulates excessive inflammatory responses to protect organs during tissue injury and infection. Stimulation of acetylcholine via the α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7nAChR) exerts inhibitory effects on leukocytes including macrophages and type 2 innate lymphoid cells. Although it remains unclear whether the inhibitory effects of acetylcholine via α7nAChR in inflammatory cells can regulate inflammation in COPD, neuroimmune interactions including the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway might serve as potential therapeutic targets.",Effects of Chitosan Oligosaccharides on Human Blood Components.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30559672,Frontiers in pharmacology,2018 12 20,"Chitosan oligosaccharide (COS) is known for its unique biological activities such as anti-tumor, anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, anti-bacterial activity, biological recognition, and immune enhancing effects, and thus continuous attracting many research interests in drug, food, cosmetics, biomaterials and tissue engineering fields. In comparison to its corresponding polymer, COS has much higher absorption profiles at the intestinal level, which results in permitting its quick access to the blood flow and potential contacting with blood components. However, the effects of COS on blood components remain unclear to date. Herein, two COS with different molecular weight (MW) were characterized by FTIR and 1H NMR, and then their effects on human blood components, including red blood cells (RBCs) (hemolysis, deformability, and aggregation), coagulation system [activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), prothrombin time (PT), thrombin time (TT), and the concentration of fibrinogen (Fib)], complement (C3a and C5a activation), and platelet (activation and aggregation), were comprehensively studied. In the case of RBCs, COS exhibited a low risk of hemolysis in a dose and molecular weight dependent manner and the irreversible aggregation was observed in their high concentration. For coagulation system, COS has a mild anticoagulation activity through blocking the intrinsic coagulation pathway. In addition, COS showed no effect on complement activation in C3a and C5a and on platelet activation while inhibition of platelet aggregation was evident. Finally, the mechanism that effects of COS on blood components was discussed and proposed.","2,6-Bis(2-Benzimidazolyl)Pyridine (BBP) Is a Potent and Selective Inhibitor of Small Conductance Calcium-Activated Potassium (SK) Channels.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30559671,Frontiers in pharmacology,2018 12 20,"A variety of polycyclic pyridines have been proposed as inhibitors of the small conductance calcium-activated potassium (SK) channel. To this group belongs 2,6-bis(2-benzimidazolyl)pyridine (BBP), a commercially and readily available small organic compound which has earlier been described in a broad range of chemical and biological uses. Here, we show how BBP can also be used as a potent and specific SK channel blocker in vitro. The potency of BBP was measured using automatic patch clamp on all three SK channel subtypes, resulting in similar IC50 of 0.4 μM. We also assessed the selectivity of BBP on a panel of calcium-activated and voltage-activated potassium channels using two-electrode voltage clamp, automatic and manual patch clamp. BBP did not have any effect on IK, Kir2.1, Kir3.1+Kir3.4, Kv1.5, Kv4.3/KCHIP2 and Kv7.1/KCNE1 currents and was 4.8-fold and 46-fold more potent on all SK channel subtypes vs. BK and hERG channels, respectively. Moreover, we were able to identify H491 as a critical amino acid for the pharmacological effect of BBP on the SK channel. From a medicinal chemistry perspective, BBP could be used as a starting point for the design of new and improved SK inhibitors.",Obesity: A New Adverse Effect of Antibiotics?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30559670,Frontiers in pharmacology,2018 12 20,"Since the introduction of antibiotics, they have been used freely, with their prescription occurring almost always when they were not necessary.

In the research effort entertained herein, a correlation between the use and abuse of antibiotics and the onset of obesity was investigated.",A Comparative Study on the Efficacy of NLRP3 Inflammasome Signaling Inhibitors in a Pre-clinical Model of Bowel Inflammation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30559669,Frontiers in pharmacology,2019 01 15,"Nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain leucine rich repeat and pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome is pivotal in maintaining intestinal homeostasis and sustaining enteric immune responses in the setting of inflammatory bowel diseases. Drugs acting as NLRP3 blockers could represent innovative strategies for treatment of bowel inflammation. This study was performed in rats with dinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (DNBS)-induced colitis, to investigate how the direct blockade of NLRP3 inflammasome with an irreversible inhibitor (INF39) compares with Ac-YVAD-cmk (YVAD, caspase-1 inhibitor) and anakinra (IL-1β receptor antagonist), acting downstream on NLRP3 signaling. Animals with DNBS-colitis received YVAD (3 mg/kg) or anakinra (100 mg/Kg) intraperitoneally, and INF39 (25 mg/kg) or dexamethasone (DEX, 1 mg/kg) orally for 6 days, starting on the same day of colitis induction. Under colitis, there was a body weight decrease, which was attenuated by YVAD, anakinra or INF39, but not DEX. All test drugs counteracted the increase in spleen weight. The colonic shortening and morphological colonic alterations associated with colitis were counteracted by INF39, anakinra and DEX, while YVAD was without effects. Tissue increments of myeloperoxidase, tumor necrosis factor and interleukin-1β were more effectively counteracted by INF39 and DEX, than YVAD and anakinra. These findings indicate that: (1) direct inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome with INF39 is more effective than caspase-1 inhibition or IL-1β receptor blockade in reducing systemic and bowel inflammatory alterations; (2) direct NLRP3 inhibition can be a suitable strategy for treatment of bowel inflammation."

For proprioception, i.e., the ""movement sense"", however, the optimal frequency is unknown. We studied the effect of passive-finger-movement frequency on proprioceptive fMRI responses using a novel pneumatic-movement actuator. Eleven healthy right-handed volunteers participated in the study. The movement actuator passively moved the participant's right index finger at frequencies of 0.3, 1, 3, 6, 9, or 12 Hz in a blocked design. A functional localizer was used to define regions-of-interest in SI and SII cortices. In addition, effect of movement range on the fMRI responses was tested in a separate session with 1, 3, 5, and 7 mm movement ranges at a fixed 2 Hz frequency. In primary somatosensory (SI) cortex, the responses were stronger at 3 Hz than at 0.3 Hz (p < 0.001) or 1 Hz (p < 0.05), and at ≥6 Hz than 0.3 Hz (p < 0.001 for frequencies ≥ 6 Hz). In secondary somatosensory (SII) cortex, all movements, except at 0.3 Hz, elicited significant responses of similar strength. In addition, 6, 9, and 12-Hz movements elicited a significant offset response in both SI and SII cortices (p < 0.001-0.05). SI cortex required a total stimulation duration of 4 min to elicit significant activations at the group-level whereas for SII cortex 1 min 20 s was sufficient. Increase in the movement range led to stronger responses in SI cortex, but not in SII cortex. Movements above 3 Hz elicited the strongest SI cortex responses, and increase in the movement range enhanced the response strength. We thus recommend that movements at 3-6 Hz with a movement range of 5 mm or higher to be used in future studies of proprioception. Our results are in-line with previous fMRI and PET studies using tactile or median nerve stimulation at different stimulation frequencies.",The Impact of Intracerebral Hemorrhage on the Progression of White Matter Hyperintensity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30559656,Frontiers in human neuroscience,2018 12 20,"Objective: The exact relationship between white matter hyperintensity (WMH) and intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) after ICH remains unclear. In this retrospective study, we investigated whether patients with ICH had more severe WMH progression. Patients and Methods: A total of 2,951 patients aged ≥40 years with ICH who received brain computed tomography (CT) imaging within 12 h of ICH symptom onset were screened. Ninety patients with two fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) assessments, including 36 patients with Lobar ICH, 40 with basal ganglia region ICH and 14 with ICH at other sites, were included in the final study. We selected 90 age- and gender-matched healthy individuals with two MRI scans as the control group. The WMH volumes at baseline and follow-up were assessed using the FLAIR image by MRICRON and ITK-SNAP software, while the hematoma volumes were calculated based on the CT images using ITK-SNAP software. Results: The annual progression rate of WMH was significantly higher in the ICH group compared with the control group (p < 0.05). Furthermore, WMH progression was associated with the ICH volume. The largest ICH volume (>30 mL) was associated with the highest annual progression rate of WMH (p < 0.05). In contrast, no trend toward an association between ICH location and the annual progression rate of WMH was observed (p > 0.05). Conclusions: Our results showed that ICH patients had more severe WMH progression and that larger ICH volume was related to greater progression of WMH after ICH. These results could provide important prognostic information about patients with ICH.",A Longer Interstimulus Interval Yields Better Learning in Adults and Young Adolescents.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30559655,Frontiers in behavioral neuroscience,2018 12 20,"Eyeblink conditioning is one of the most popular experimental paradigms for studying the neural mechanisms underlying learning and memory. A key parameter in eyeblink conditioning is the interstimulus interval (ISI), the time between the onset of the conditional stimulus (CS) and the onset of the unconditional stimulus (US). Though previous studies have examined how the ISI affects learning there is no clear consensus concerning which ISI is most effective and different researchers use different ISIs. Importantly, the brain undergoes changes throughout life with significant cerebellar growth in adolescents, which could mean that different ISIs might be called for in children, adolescents and adults. Moreover, the fact that animals are often trained with a shorter ISI than humans make direct comparisons problematic. In this study, we compared eyeblink conditioning in young adolescents aged 10-15 and adults using one short ISI (300 ms) and one long ISI (500 ms). The results demonstrate that young adolescents and adults produce a higher percentage of CRs when they are trained with a 500 ms ISI compared to a 300 ms ISI. The results also show that learning is better in the adults, especially for the shorter ISI.",A Framework for Studying the Heterogeneity of Risk Factors in Math Anxiety.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30559654,Frontiers in behavioral neuroscience,2018 12 20,"Math anxiety is a prevalent disorder which affects many people worldwide. Here, we draw together ample evidence to suggest a dynamic developmental bio-psycho-social model. The model highlights the complex pathways towards the development of math anxiety, with a focus on dynamism. That is, math anxiety is viewed here as a dynamic interplay between environmental (parenting style, as well as social style including teachers' attitude, instruction strategies and wider social effects) and intrinsic factors (i.e., neuro-cognitive and genetic predispositions, including brain malfunctions, heritability, predisposition towards general anxiety) and basic numerical cognition and affective factors. The model predicts that the dynamic interplay between these factors can either prevent or promote math anxiety's effects on the development of heterogeneous symptoms. Considering the universal nature of math anxiety, a systematic description of the vulnerability factors that contribute to the development of math anxiety is vital.

We describe oscillations in evoked and background activity in the cat's superficial layers of the superior colliculus, a retinorecipient structure in the extrageniculate visual pathway. Extracellular single-unit activity was recorded during periods with and without visual stimulation under isoflurane anesthesia in the mixture of N2O/O2. Autocorrelation, FFT and renewal density analyses were used to detect and characterize oscillations in the neuronal activity. Oscillations were common in the background and stimulus-evoked activity. Frequency range of background oscillations spanned between 5 and 90 Hz. Oscillations in evoked activity were observed in about half of the cells and could appear in two forms -stimulus-phase-locked (10-100 Hz), and stimulus-phase-independent (8-100 Hz) oscillations. Stimulus-phase-independent and background oscillatory frequencies were very similar within activity of particular neurons suggesting that stimulus-phase-independent oscillations may be a form of enhanced ""spontaneous"" oscillations. Stimulus-phase-locked oscillations were present in responses to moving and flashing stimuli. In contrast to stimulus-phase-independent oscillations, the strength of stimulus-phase-locked oscillations was positively correlated with stimulus velocity and neuronal firing rate. Our results suggest that in the superficial layers of the superior colliculus stimulus-phase-independent oscillations may be generated by the same mechanism(s) that lie in the base of ""spontaneous"" oscillations, while stimulus-phase-locked oscillations may result from interactions within the intra-collicular network and/or from a phase reset of oscillations present in the background activity.",Cochlear Synaptopathy Changes Sound-Evoked Activity Without Changing Spontaneous Discharge in the Mouse Inferior Colliculus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30559652,Frontiers in systems neuroscience,2018 12 21,"Tinnitus and hyperacusis are life-disrupting perceptual abnormalities that are often preceded by acoustic overexposure. Animal models of overexposure have suggested a link between these phenomena and neural hyperactivity, i.e., elevated spontaneous rates (SRs) and sound-evoked responses. Prior work has focused on changes in central auditory responses, with less attention paid to the exact nature of the associated cochlear damage. The demonstration that acoustic overexposure can cause cochlear neuropathy without permanent threshold elevation suggests cochlear neuropathy per se may be a key elicitor of neural hyperactivity. We addressed this hypothesis by recording responses in the mouse inferior colliculus (IC) following a bilateral, neuropathic noise exposure. One to three weeks post-exposure, mean SRs were unchanged in mice recorded while awake, or under anesthesia. SRs were also unaffected by more intense, or unilateral exposures. These results suggest that neither neuropathy nor hair cell loss are sufficient to raise SRs in the IC, at least in 7-week-old mice, 1-3 weeks post exposure. However, it is not clear whether our mice had tinnitus. Tone-evoked rate-level functions at the CF were steeper following exposure, specifically in the region of maximal neuropathy. Furthermore, suppression driven by off-CF tones and by ipsilateral noise were reduced. Both changes were especially pronounced in neurons of awake mice. This neural hypersensitivity may manifest as behavioral hypersensitivity to sound - prior work reports that this same exposure causes elevated acoustic startle. Together, these results indicate that neuropathy may initiate a compensatory response in the central auditory system leading to the genesis of hyperacusis.",Morphine Binds Creatine Kinase B and Inhibits Its Activity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30559651,Frontiers in cellular neuroscience,2018 12 20,"Morphine is an analgesic alkaloid used to relieve severe pain, and irreversible binding of morphine to specific unknown proteins has been previously observed. In the brain, changes in the expression of energy metabolism enzymes contribute to behavioral abnormalities during chronic morphine treatment. Creatine kinase B (CK-B) is a key enzyme involved in brain energy metabolism. CK-B also corresponds to the imidazoline-binding protein I2 which binds dopamine (a precursor of morphine biosynthesis) irreversibly. Using biochemical approaches, we show that recombinant mouse CK-B possesses a μM affinity for morphine and binds to morphine in vitro. The complex formed by CK-B and morphine is resistant to detergents, reducing agents, heat treatment and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). CK-B-derived peptides CK-B1-75 and CK-B184-258 were identified as two specific morphine binding-peptides. In vitro, morphine (1-100 μM) significantly reduces recombinant CK-B enzymatic activity. Accordingly, in vivo morphine administration (7.5 mg/kg, i.p.) to mice significantly decreased brain extract CK-B activity compared to saline-treated animals. Together, these results show that morphine strongly binds CK-B and inhibits its activity in vitro and in vivo.",Unexpected Exacerbation of Neuroinflammatory Response After a Combined Therapy in Old Parkinsonian Mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30559650,Frontiers in cellular neuroscience,2018 12 20,"The design of therapeutic strategies that focus on the repositioning of anti-inflammatory and antioxidant drugs are a great bet to slow down the progression of neurodegenerative disorders. Despite the fact that Parkinson's disease (PD) is an age-related pathology, almost all experimental studies are carried out in young animals. Here, we evaluated the possible neuroprotective effect of the combination of the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and the anti-inflammatory HA-1077 in aged 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-treated mice (C57BL/6 mice, 20 months old), whose individual treatment has been shown to have neuroprotective effects in this Parkinsonism model. Interestingly, NAC+HA-1077-based treatment produced a significant increase in dopaminergic neuronal death accompanied by an increase in microglial and astroglial activation in the Substantia Nigra pars compacta (SNpc) and striatum of old-Parkinsonian mice compared to their control group. The astroglial response was also explored by co-immunostaining for GFAP and S100b together with p-JNK and it was found to be particularly exacerbated in the MPTP+NAC+HA-1077 group. The unexpected toxic effects found in the combined use of NAC and HA-1077 in old-Parkinsonian mice highlight the importance of taking into account that in elderly Parkinsonian patients the combination of some drugs (most of them used for other different age-related alterations) can have side effects that may result in the exacerbation of the neurodegenerative process.",Characterization of Retinal Functionality at Different Eccentricities in a Diurnal Rodent.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30559649,Frontiers in cellular neuroscience,2018 12 20,"Although the properties of the neurons of the visual system that process central and peripheral regions of the visual field have been widely researched in the visual cortex and the LGN, they have scarcely been documented for the retina. The retina is the first step in integrating optical signals, and despite considerable efforts to functionally characterize the different types of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), a clear account of the particular functionality of cells with central vs. peripheral fields is still wanting. Here, we use electrophysiological recordings, gathered from retinas of the diurnal rodent Octodon degus, to show that RGCs with peripheral receptive fields (RF) are larger, faster, and have shorter transient responses. This translates into higher sensitivity at high temporal frequencies and a full frequency bandwidth when compared to RGCs with more central RF. We also observed that imbalances between ON and OFF cell populations are preserved with eccentricity. Finally, the high diversity of functional types of RGCs highlights the complexity of the computational strategies implemented in the early stages of visual processing, which could inspire the development of bio-inspired artificial systems.",Inhibition of the Neuronal Calcium Sensor DREAM Modulates Presenilin-2 Endoproteolysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30559648,Frontiers in molecular neuroscience,2018 12 20,"Deregulated intracellular Ca2+ and protein homeostasis underlie synaptic dysfunction and are common features in neurodegenerative diseases. DREAM, also known as calsenilin or KChIP-3, is a multifunctional Ca2+ binding protein of the neuronal calcium sensor superfamily with specific functions through protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions. Small-molecules able to bind DREAM, like the anti-diabetic drug repaglinide, disrupt some of the interactions with other proteins and modulate DREAM activity on Kv4 channels or on the processing of activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). Here, we show the interaction of endogenous DREAM and presenilin-2 (PS2) in mouse brain and, using DREAM deficient mice or transgenic mice overexpressing a dominant active DREAM (daDREAM) mutant in the brain, we provide genetic evidence of the role of DREAM in the endoproteolysis of endogenous PS2. We show that repaglinide disrupts the interaction between DREAM and the C-terminal PS2 fragment (Ct-PS2) by coimmunoprecipitation assays. Exposure to sub-micromolar concentrations of repaglinide reduces the levels of Ct-PS2 fragment in N2a neuroblastoma cells. These results suggest that the interaction between DREAM and PS2 may represent a new target for modulation of PS2 processing, which could have therapeutic potential in Alzheimer's disease (AD) treatment."

Lung cancer was diagnosed by medical examinations. Besides, chronic gastritis with intestinal metaplasia was indicated by gastroscopic biopsies, while colorectal polyps found by colonoscopy. All 13 colorectal polyps were removed, and radical surgery for lung cancer was performed. Fortunately, pathological examinations indicated that it was early lung cancer. The ground glass nodule (GGN) in left lung identified during the follow-up will be resected when needed. It is speculated that multiple manifestations of the patient may be related to radiation, and different lesions in the organs may be related to systemic adaptive response.

Increases in muscular strength/power, flexibility, and gait speed; improvements in bone mineral density, balance, and the quality of life; and decreased pain and risk of falls are reported. The aim is to present a review about the importance of WBVE for elderly individuals, considering clinical studies and meta-analyses, on bone and muscle strength/power. There is evidence supporting beneficial effect of WBVE in postmenopausal women (PW); however, effects in PW with osteoporosis are unclear. Age-related decrease in muscle mass and function contribute to undesirable health conditions, including death risk. The WBVEs improve muscle strength/power, functional independence measure, balance, and various fall risk factors, and mobility, measured by Timed Up and Go test, increased significantly after WBVE. An explanation for the absence of positive effects in some outcomes could be related to discrepancies in WBVE protocols as well as the populations tested. It is concluded that WBVE is effective for counteracting the loss of muscle strength associated with sarcopenia in elderly individuals. Balance and leg and plantar flexor strength improvements due to WBV indicate benefit to reduce risk and incidence of falls, frailty, and fracture risks. However, long-term feasibility of WBVE for musculoskeletal and bone health in elderly individuals needs further investigation.","Quercetin and Idebenone Ameliorate Oxidative Stress, Inflammation, DNA damage, and Apoptosis Induced by Titanium Dioxide Nanoparticles in Rat Liver.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30559635,Dose-response : a publication of International Hormesis Society,2018 12 20,"Titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO2-NPs) are extensively used in a wide range of applications; however, many reports have investigated their nanotoxicological effect at the molecular level either in vitro or in vivo systems. The defensive roles of quercetin (Qur) or idebenone (Id) against the hepatotoxicity induced by TiO2-NPs were evaluated in the current study. The results showed that the coadministration of Qur or Id to rats intoxicated with TiO2-NPs markedly ameliorated the elevation in hepatic malondialdehyde (MDA), serum alanine amino-transferase (ALT), glucose, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), immunoglobin G (IgG), and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels compared to their levels in TiO2-NPs-treated rats.

The histopathological examination of the liver section showed that TiO2-NPs caused severe degeneration of most hepatocytes with an increase in collagen in the portal region, while treatment with the antioxidants in question improved liver architecture.

Part F, Traffic psychology and behaviour",2018 12 21,"One challenge in using naturalistic driving data is producing a holistic analysis of these highly variable datasets. Typical analyses focus on isolated events, such as large g-force accelerations indicating a possible near-crash. Examining isolated events is ill-suited for identifying patterns in continuous activities such as maintaining vehicle control. We present an alternative approach that converts driving data into a text representation and uses topic modeling to identify patterns across the dataset. This approach enables the discovery of non-linear patterns, reduces the dimensionality of the data, and captures subtle variations in driver behavior. In this study topic models are used to concisely described patterns in trips from drivers with and without untreated obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The analysis included 5000 trips (50 trips from 100 drivers; 66 drivers with OSA; 34 comparison drivers). Trips were treated as documents, and speed and acceleration data from the trips were converted to ""driving words."" The identified patterns, called topics, were determined based on regularities in the co-occurrence of the driving words within the trips. This representation was used in random forest models to predict the driver condition (i.e., OSA or comparison) for each trip. Models with 10, 15 and 20 topics had better accuracy in predicting the driver condition, with a maximum AUC of 0.73 for a model with 20 topics. Trips from drivers with OSA were more likely to be defined by topics for smaller lateral accelerations at low speeds.

A key to achieving these hearing abilities is the speed and precision required for the temporal coding of sound-a process heavily dependent on the structural, synaptic, and intrinsic specializations in the avian auditory brainstem. Here, we review recent work from us and others focusing on the specialization of neurons in the chicken cochlear nucleus magnocellularis (NM)-a first-order auditory brainstem structure analogous to bushy cells in the mammalian anteroventral cochlear nucleus. Similar to their mammalian counterpart, NM neurons are mostly adendritic and receive auditory nerve input through large axosomatic endbulb of Held synapses. Axonal projections from NM neurons to their downstream auditory targets are sophisticatedly programmed regarding their length, caliber, myelination, and conduction velocity. Specialized voltage-dependent potassium and sodium channel properties also play important and unique roles in shaping the functional phenotype of NM neurons. Working synergistically with potassium channels, an atypical current known as resurgent sodium current promotes rapid and precise action potential firing for NM neurons.

Several promising item selection algorithms used in MCAT are extended to PMCAT, and two new item selection methods are proposed to improve the existing selection strategies. Two simulation studies are conducted to demonstrate the feasibility of the extended and proposed methods. The simulation results show that most of the extended item selection methods for PMCAT are feasible and the new proposed item selection methods perform well. Combined with the security of the pool, when two dimensions are considered (Study 1), the proposed modified continuous entropy method (MCEM) is the ideal of all in that it gains the lowest item exposure rate and has a relatively high accuracy.

Results of the simulation study show that both validation methods perform better when missing responses are imputed using EM imputation or logistic regression instead of being treated as incorrect and using listwise deletion. The nonparametric Q-matrix validation method outperforms the EM-based δ-method in most conditions. Higher missing rates yield poorer performance of both methods.

Both methods have their pros and cons, and sometimes neither is convenient for practitioners. This study provides an innovative hybrid strategy to build optimal MST panels efficiently most of the time. Empirical data and results by using this strategy will be provided.",Using Odds Ratios to Detect Differential Item Functioning.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30559570,Applied psychological measurement,2018 12 20,"Differential item functioning (DIF) makes test scores incomparable and substantially threatens test validity. Although conventional approaches, such as the logistic regression (LR) and the Mantel-Haenszel (MH) methods, have worked well, they are vulnerable to high percentages of DIF items in a test and missing data. This study developed a simple but effective method to detect DIF using the odds ratio (OR) of two groups' responses to a studied item. The OR method uses all available information from examinees' responses, and it can eliminate the potential influence of bias in the total scores. Through a series of simulation studies in which the DIF pattern, impact, sample size (equal/unequal), purification procedure (with/without), percentages of DIF items, and proportions of missing data were manipulated, the performance of the OR method was evaluated and compared with the LR and MH methods. The results showed that the OR method without a purification procedure outperformed the LR and MH methods in controlling false positive rates and yielding high true positive rates when tests had a high percentage of DIF items favoring the same group. In addition, only the OR method was feasible when tests adopted the item matrix sampling design. The effectiveness of the OR method with an empirical example was illustrated.",The Use of Multivariate Generalizability Theory to Evaluate the Quality of Subscores.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30559569,Applied psychological measurement,2018 12 20,"Conventional methods for evaluating the utility of subscores rely on reliability and correlation coefficients. However, correlations can overlook a notable source of variability: variation in subtest means/difficulties. Brennan introduced a reliability index for score profiles based on multivariate generalizability theory, designated as 
G
 , which is sensitive to variation in subtest difficulty. However, there has been little, if any, research evaluating the properties of this index. A series of simulation experiments, as well as analyses of real data, were conducted to investigate 
G
 under various conditions of subtest reliability, subtest correlations, and variability in subtest means. Three pilot studies evaluated 
G
 in the context of a single group of examinees. Results of the pilots indicated that 
G
 indices were typically low; across the 108 experimental conditions, 
G
 ranged from .23 to .86, with an overall mean of 0.63. The findings were consistent with previous research, indicating that subscores often do not have interpretive value. Importantly, there were many conditions for which the correlation-based method known as proportion reduction in mean-square error (PRMSE; Haberman, 2006) indicated that subscores were worth reporting, but for which values of 
G
 fell into the .50s, .60s, and .70s. The main study investigated 
G
 within the context of score profiles for examinee subgroups. Again, not only 
G
 indices were generally low, but it was also found that 
G
 can be sensitive to subgroup differences when PRMSE is not. Analyses of real data and subsequent discussion address how 
G
 can supplement PRMSE for characterizing the quality of subscores.","Sarcomas of the breast: findings on mammography, ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30559558,Radiologia brasileira,2018 12 20,"Sarcomas of the breast belong to a heterogeneous group of breast tumors of mesenchymal origin, without epithelial components. These tumors can be primary or secondary (after previous treatment for breast cancer), are rare, present aggressive behavior, and have a poor prognosis. They occur mainly in women between 45 and 50 years of age, with the exception of angiosarcomas, which can occur in younger patients. Clinically, breast sarcomas manifest as palpable, mobile, rapidly growing masses, without skin thickening, axillary lymphadenopathy, or nipple discharge. Although the imaging findings are non specific, they can be suggestive of sarcoma. For instance, a solitary mass showing rapid growth, with circumscribed or indistinct margins and, a complex (solid-cystic) or heterogeneous echotexture, without axillary lymph node involvement, can raise the suspicion of sarcoma. The treatment is not well established, because of the rarity and heterogeneity of this type of neoplasm. The principles of treatment for sarcoma of the breast have been addressed only in small cohort studies. In most cases, the treatment of choice is surgery without axillary lymphadenectomy.",Practical approach to primary retroperitoneal masses in adults.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30559557,Radiologia brasileira,2018 12 20,"Primary retroperitoneal masses constitute a heterogeneous group of uncommon lesions and represent a challenge due to overlapping imaging findings. Most are malignant lesions. Although they are more prevalent in adults, they can occur at any age. Such lesions are classified as primary when they do not originate from a specific retroperitoneal organ and are divided, according to the image findings, into two major groups: solid and cystic. The clinical findings are nonspecific and vary depending on the location of the lesion in relation to adjacent structures, as well as on its behavior. The main imaging methods used for staging and surgical planning, as well as for selecting the biopsy site and guiding the biopsy procedure, are computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. In most cases, the treatment is challenging, because of the size of the lesions, vascular involvement, or involvement of adjacent organs. In this article, we present a review of the retroperitoneal anatomy and a practical approach to the main imaging features to be evaluated, with a view to the differential diagnosis, which can guide the clinical management.",Pulmonary inhalation-perfusion scintigraphy in the evaluation of bronchoscopic treatment of bronchopleural fistula.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30559556,Radiologia brasileira,2018 12 20,To evaluate the use of pulmonary inhalation-perfusion scintigraphy as an alternative method of investigation and follow-up in patients with bronchopleural fistula (BPF).

Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers,2019 05 02,"The human brain can be represented as a graph in which neural units such as cells or small volumes of tissue are heterogeneously connected to one another through structural or functional links. Brain graphs are parsimonious representations of neural systems that have begun to offer fundamental insights into healthy human cognition, as well as its alteration in disease. A critical open question in network neuroscience lies in how neural units cluster into densely interconnected groups that can provide the coordinated activity that is characteristic of perception, action, and adaptive behaviors. Tools that have proven particularly useful for addressing this question are community detection approaches, which can identify communities or modules: groups of neural units that are densely interconnected with other units in their own group but sparsely interconnected with units in other groups. In this paper, we describe a common community detection algorithm known as modularity maximization, and we detail its applications to brain graphs constructed from neuroimaging data. We pay particular attention to important algorithmic considerations, especially in recent extensions of these techniques to graphs that evolve in time. After recounting a few fundamental insights that these techniques have provided into brain function, we highlight potential avenues of methodological advancements for future studies seeking to better characterize the patterns of coordinated activity in the brain that accompany human behavior. This tutorial provides a naive reader with an introduction to theoretical considerations pertinent to the generation of brain graphs, an understanding of modularity maximization for community detection, a resource of statistical measures that can be used to characterize community structure, and an appreciation of the usefulness of these approaches in uncovering behaviorally-relevant network dynamics in neuroimaging data.",High-Density Redox Amplified Coulostatic Discharge-Based Biosensor Array.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30559530,IEEE journal of solid-state circuits,2018 12 21,"High-density biosensor arrays are essential for many cutting-edge biomedical applications including point-of-care vaccination screening to detect multiple highly-contagious diseases.

It uses a coulostatic discharge sensing technique and interdigitated electrode geometry to reduce both the complexity and size of the readout circuitry. Each biopixel contains an interdigitated microelectrode with a 13 aA low-leakage readout circuit directly underneath. Compared to standard planar electrodes, the implemented interdigitated electrodes achieve a maximum amplification factor of 10.5× from redox cycling. The array's sensor density is comparable to state-of-the-art arrays, all without augmenting the sensors with complex post-processing.

We describe how severe PN-associated metabolic consequences were averted during this acetate shortage. Summary: The patient with inability to swallow and significant weight loss was admitted to the hospital and given PN after failure to tolerate either gastric or jejunal feeding due to dysmotility and severe abdominal distension and discomfort. PN was initiated and the nasogastric and jejunal tubes were left to low intermittent suction or gravity drainage (average losses of 800 mL and 1600 mL daily, respectively) to reduce abdominal distension. The patient had been stable on PN for approximately 2 months prior to when a shortage in potassium acetate and sodium acetate occurred. As a result, potassium and sodium requirements had to be met with chloride and phosphate salts. The patient developed a non-anion gap metabolic acidosis after 11 days of acetate-free PN. Progression to severe acidemia was avoided by administration of sodium bicarbonate daily for 3 days and replacement of 0.9% sodium chloride supplemental intravenous fluid with lactated ringers solution. Conclusion: This case report illustrates that PN component shortages require clinicians to closely monitor patients who require PN. In addition, clinicians may need to use creative therapeutic strategies to avoid potential serious patient harm during PN component shortages.",Implementation of the Procalcitonin Assay in a Rural Hospital.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30559527,Hospital pharmacy,2018 12 20,"Objective: Most positive studies in procalcitonin (PCT) utilization were done in large, tertiary medical centers.

This article is the first to describe in detail the implementation process and initial outcomes after 6 months of PCT testing in a rural, 65-bed, primary hospital. Methods: Education before and during PCT implementation as well as facility rollout are described. Initial outcomes were assessed using a before and after quasi-experimental study design comparing 2 identical 6-month time periods: May to October 2016 and May to October 2017. Antibiotic consumption is described with days of therapy (DOT) per 1000 patient days (PD). Antimicrobial purchasing costs, admission rates, and length of stay (LOS) are also compared. Results: Antimicrobial consumption was variable with the greatest reduction at 6 months: 856 DOT/1000 PD before versus 576 DOT/1000 PD after (P < .0001). Admission rates and LOS were unaffected. There was no associated savings in antibiotic purchasing costs: $114 189.79 before and $139 829.26 after (difference +$25 639.47).

The author suggests using commonly asked pharmacy-based questions, directly from the public, as a proxy to identify the information most desired by patients. The author assumes that radio callers are not calling to ask questions when they already know the answers. Thus, having identified the information most desired by radio-show callers, pharmacist educators, no matter the setting, can be provided with a ready-made resource that lists the most common concerns from over 6,000 radio callers.

To describe a successful remediation for an Acute Care Medicine advanced pharmacy practice experience (APPE) in a student with multiple learning deficits. Methods. A literature review of pharmacy and medical experiential remediation was conducted to identify best practices to implement prior to designing the remediation for our student case. Based on this search and experience as preceptors, a three-phase remediation was designed: one week for assessment, two weeks for development of learning skills and strategies and six weeks for an on-campus APPE. Success of the remediation was determined by student performance, as defined by the APPE preceptor, in all relevant 2013 Center for the Advancement of Pharmacy Education (CAPE) educational outcomes. Results. Baseline assessment indicated that the student was below minimal competency in six of 13 relevant 2013 CAPE educational outcomes. Upon completion of the three-part remediation, the student repeated the Acute Care Medicine APPE, achieving better than minimal competency in all 13 outcomes. The student demonstrated significant improvement in nine of 13 CAPE educational outcomes. Conclusion. This student case provides a novel and successful blueprint for remediation of APPE.

To develop and establish validity for a grading rubric to evaluate diabetes subjective, objective, assessment, plan (SOAP) note writing on primary care (PC) advanced pharmacy practice experiences (APPEs), and to assess reliability and student perceptions of the rubric. Methods. Ten PC APPE faculty members collaborated to develop a rubric to provide formative and summative feedback on three written SOAP notes per APPE student over a 10-month period. Correlation analyses were conducted between rubric scores and three criterion variables to assess criterion-related validity: APPE grades, Pharmaceutical Care Ability Profile Scores, and Global Impression Scores. Inter-rater and intra-rater reliability testing were completed using Cohen's kappa and Intraclass Correlation Coefficients (ICC). Student perceptions were assessed through an anonymous student survey. Results. Fifty-one students and 167 SOAP notes were evaluated using the final rubric. The mean score significantly increased from the first to second SOAP note and from the first to third SOAP note. Statistically significant positive correlations were found between final rubric scores and criterion variables. The ICC for inter-rater reliability was fair (.59) for final rubric scores and excellent for intra-rater reliability (.98 to1.00). Students responded that the rubric improved their ability (84.9%) and confidence (92.4%) to write SOAP notes. Conclusion. The rubric may be used to make valid decisions about students' SOAP note writing ability and may increase their confidence in this area.

To investigate if students in the new course structure attained the same level of compounding competency as students in the legacy course structure. Methods. Students compounded four nonsterile preparations common to both the legacy curriculum (PCL) and the transformed curriculum (TC). The preparations were compared using relative potency or weight variation as a measure of compounding competency. They represented the broad range of compounding complexities required in compounding courses at the school. Results. The mean relative potencies of three nonsterile preparations were statistically different, with only the mean of the TC hydrocortisone medication stick being outside of the acceptable range of the laboratory's criteria. However, the standard deviation (SD) was markedly different in each preparation pair suggesting that the number of students correctly compounding the preparation in the first attempt might be an important factor in the analysis. In contrast, the mean weight variation data of the phenol-menthol soft troches and enalapril tablet triturates were almost identical. Conclusion. The relative potency results suggested that equivalent competency in the two student groups was possible for preparations that involved simple solutions or filled fixed volume molds. However, the hydrocortisone medication stick data indicated that understanding the science of a preparation may require more knowledge or time.",Implementation of a Medicare Plan Selection Assistance Program Through a Community Partnership.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30559499,American journal of pharmaceutical education,2018 12 20,"Objective.

To compare pharmacy students' perceptions with patients' reasons for medication non-adherence. Methods. Pharmacy students completing an experiential rotation recruited patients exhibiting medication non-adherence from community pharmacies and asked them to respond to statements about reasons for their medication non-adherence. Patient responses were ranked in order of prevalence and compared to self-reported student perceptions on reasons for non-adherence. Results. There was a significant difference between patients' and students' rankings of reasons for medication non-adherence. Significant factors for patients included medications that interfere with lifestyle, sexual health and drinking alcohol; whereas, students believed that cognitive-related issues were patients' primary reasons for non-adherence to their medications. Conclusion. Educational opportunities to reflect on and discuss differing perspectives should be provided in the pharmacy curriculum to better equip students to address medication adherence issues and improve patient care."

Thanks to these capabilities, nanolasers are now an emergent tool for a variety of practical applications. In this Review, we explain the intrinsic merits of nanolasers and assess recent progress on their applications, particularly for optical interconnects, near-field spectroscopy and sensing, optical probing for biological systems and far-field beam synthesis through near-field eigenmode engineering. We highlight the scientific and engineering challenges that remain for forging nanolasers into powerful tools for nanoscience and nanotechnology.",Nonlinear light generation in topological nanostructures.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30559485,Nature nanotechnology,2019 05 03,"Topological photonics has emerged as a route to robust optical circuitry protected against disorder1,2 and now includes demonstrations such as topologically protected lasing3-5 and single-photon transport6. Recently, nonlinear optical topological structures have attracted special theoretical interest7-11, as they enable tuning of topological properties by a change in the light intensity7,12 and can break optical reciprocity13-15 to realize full topological protection. However, so far, non-reciprocal topological states have only been realized using magneto-optical materials and macroscopic set-ups with external magnets4,16, which is not feasible for nanoscale integration. Here we report the observation of a third-harmonic signal from a topologically non-trivial zigzag array of dielectric nanoparticles and the demonstration of strong enhancement of the nonlinear photon generation at the edge states of the array. The signal enhancement is due to the interaction between the Mie resonances of silicon nanoparticles and the topological localization of the electric field at the edges. The system is also robust against various perturbations and structural defects. Moreover, we show that the interplay between topology, bi-anisotropy and nonlinearity makes parametric photon generation tunable and non-reciprocal. Our study brings nonlinear topological photonics concepts to the realm of nanoscience.",Giant intrinsic photoresponse in pristine graphene.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30559484,Nature nanotechnology,2019 05 03,"When the Fermi level is aligned with the Dirac point of graphene, reduced charge screening greatly enhances electron-electron scattering1-5. In an optically excited system, the kinematics of electron-electron scattering in Dirac fermions is predicted to give rise to novel optoelectronic phenomena6-11. In this paper, we report on the observation of an intrinsic photocurrent in graphene, which occurs in a different parameter regime from all the previously observed photothermoelectric or photovoltaic photocurrents in graphene12-20: the photocurrent emerges exclusively at the charge neutrality point, requiring no finite doping. Unlike other photocurrent types that are enhanced near p-n or contact junctions, the photocurrent observed in our work arises near the edges/corners. By systematic data analyses, we show that the phenomenon stems from the unique electron-electron scattering kinematics in charge-neutral graphene. Our results not only highlight the intriguing electron dynamics in the optoelectronic response of Dirac fermions, but also offer a new scheme for photodetection and energy harvesting applications based on intrinsic, charge-neutral Dirac fermions.",Detecting a long insertion variant in SAMD12 by SMRT sequencing: implications of long-read whole-genome sequencing for repeat expansion diseases.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30559482,Journal of human genetics,2019 04 10,"Long-read sequencing technology is now capable of reading single-molecule DNA with an average read length of more than 10 kb, fully enabling the coverage of large structural variations (SVs). This advantage may pave the way for the detection of unprecedented SVs as well as repeat expansions. Pathogenic SVs of only known genes used to be selectively analyzed based on prior knowledge of target DNA sequence. The unbiased application of long-read whole-genome sequencing (WGS) for the detection of pathogenic SVs has just begun. Here, we apply PacBio SMRT sequencing in a Japanese family with benign adult familial myoclonus epilepsy (BAFME). Our SV selection of low-coverage WGS data (7×) narrowed down the candidates to only six SVs in a 7.16-Mb region of the BAFME1 locus and correctly determined an approximately 4.6-kb SAMD12 intronic repeat insertion, which is causal of BAFME1. These results indicate that long-read WGS is potentially useful for evaluating all of the known SVs in a genome and identifying new disease-causing SVs in combination with other genetic methods to resolve the genetic causes of currently unexplained diseases.",TDP-43 extracted from frontotemporal lobar degeneration subject brains displays distinct aggregate assemblies and neurotoxic effects reflecting disease progression rates.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30559480,Nature neuroscience,2019 05 21,"Accumulation of abnormally phosphorylated TDP-43 (pTDP-43) is the main pathology in affected neurons of people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). Morphological diversity and neuroanatomical distribution of pTDP-43 accumulations allowed classification of FTLD cases into at least four subtypes, which are correlated with clinical presentations and genetic causes. To understand the molecular basis of this heterogeneity, we developed SarkoSpin, a new method for biochemical isolation of pathological TDP-43. By combining SarkoSpin with mass spectrometry, we revealed proteins beyond TDP-43 that become abnormally insoluble in a disease subtype-specific manner. We show that pTDP-43 extracted from brain forms stable assemblies of distinct densities and morphologies that are associated with disease subtypes. Importantly, biochemically extracted pTDP-43 assemblies showed differential neurotoxicity and seeding that were correlated with disease duration of FTLD subjects. Our data are consistent with the notion that disease heterogeneity could originate from alternate pathological TDP-43 conformations, which are reminiscent of prion strains.",Invasion of white matter tracts by glioma stem cells is regulated by a NOTCH1-SOX2 positive-feedback loop.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30559479,Nature neuroscience,2019 05 21,"Early invasive growth along specific anatomical structures, especially the white matter tract, is regarded as one of the main causes of poor therapeutic outcome of people with gliomas. We show that some glioma stem cells (GSCs) are preferentially located along white matter tracts, which exhibit a demyelinated phenotype, at the invasive frontier of glioma tissues. These GSCs are CD133+Notch1+, whereas the nerve fibers express the Notch ligand Jagged1. The Notch-induced transcription factor Sox9 promotes the transcription of SOX2 and the methylation level of the NOTCH1 promoter is attenuated by the upregulation of SOX2 to reinforce NOTCH1 expression in GSCs. This positive-feedback loop in a cohort of glioma subjects is correlated with a poor prognosis. Inhibition of Notch signaling attenuates the white-matter-tract tropism of GSCs. These findings provide evidence indicating that the NOTCH1-SOX2 positive-feedback loop controls GSC invasion along white matter tracts.",Epigenome-wide study uncovers large-scale changes in histone acetylation driven by tau pathology in aging and Alzheimer's human brains.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30559478,Nature neuroscience,2019 06 10,"Accumulation of tau and amyloid-β are two pathologic hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease. We conducted an epigenome-wide association study using the histone 3 lysine 9 acetylation (H3K9ac) mark in 669 aged human prefrontal cortices; in contrast with amyloid-β, tau protein burden had a broad effect on the epigenome, affecting 5,990 of 26,384 H3K9ac domains. Tau-related alterations aggregated in large genomic segments reflecting spatial chromatin organization, and the magnitude of these effects correlated with the segment's nuclear lamina association. Functional relevance of these chromatin changes was demonstrated by (1) consistent transcriptional changes in three independent datasets and (2) similar findings in two mouse models of Alzheimer's disease. Finally, we found that tau overexpression in induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons altered chromatin structure and that these effects could be blocked by a small molecule predicted to reverse the tau effect. Thus, we report broad tau-driven chromatin rearrangements in the aging human brain that may be reversible with heat-shock protein 90 (Hsp90) inhibitors.",Efficient coding of subjective value.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30559477,Nature neuroscience,2019 05 21,"Preference-based decisions are essential for survival, for instance, when deciding what we should (not) eat. Despite their importance, preference-based decisions are surprisingly variable and can appear irrational in ways that have defied mechanistic explanations. Here we propose that subjective valuation results from an inference process that accounts for the structure of values in the environment and that maximizes information in value representations in line with demands imposed by limited coding resources. A model of this inference process explains the variability in both subjective value reports and preference-based choices, and predicts a new preference illusion that we validate with empirical data. Interestingly, the same model explains the level of confidence associated with these reports. Our results imply that preference-based decisions reflect information-maximizing transmission and statistically optimal decoding of subjective values by a limited-capacity system. These findings provide a unified account of how humans perceive and valuate the environment to optimally guide behavior.",Human microglia regional heterogeneity and phenotypes determined by multiplexed single-cell mass cytometry.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30559476,Nature neuroscience,2019 05 21,"Microglia, the specialized innate immune cells of the CNS, play crucial roles in neural development and function. Different phenotypes and functions have been ascribed to rodent microglia, but little is known about human microglia (huMG) heterogeneity. Difficulties in procuring huMG and their susceptibility to cryopreservation damage have limited large-scale studies. Here we applied multiplexed mass cytometry for a comprehensive characterization of postmortem huMG (103 - 104 cells). We determined expression levels of 57 markers on huMG isolated from up to five different brain regions of nine donors. We identified the phenotypic signature of huMG, which was distinct from peripheral myeloid cells but was comparable to fresh huMG. We detected microglia regional heterogeneity using a hybrid workflow combining Cytobank and R/Bioconductor for multidimensional data analysis. Together, these methodologies allowed us to perform high-dimensional, large-scale immunophenotyping of huMG at the single-cell level, which facilitates their unambiguous profiling in health and disease."

However, L. chinensis has developed a dwarfing phenotype in response to the stressful habitat in grasslands that are severely degraded due to heavy grazing. The lack of transcriptomic and genomic information has prohibited the understanding of the transgenerational effect on physiological alterations in clonal L. chinensis at the molecular level in response to livestock grazing. To solve this problem, transcriptomic information from the leaves of clonal L. chinensis obtained from overgrazed (GR) and non-grazed (NG) grasslands was studied using a paired-end Illumina HiSeq 2500 sequencing platform. First, despite the influence of grazing being absent during the growth of clonal offspring in our hydroponic experiment, compared with those from the NG group, clonal L. chinensis from the GR group exhibited significant dwarf-type morphological traits. A total of 116,356 unigenes were subsequently generated and assembled de novo, of which 55,541 could be annotated to homologous matches in the NCBI non-redundant (Nr), Swiss-Prot, Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COG), gene ontology (GO), or Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) databases. The expression of 3,341 unigenes significantly differed between the GR group and the NG group with an absolute value of Log2 ratio ≥ 1. The altered expression of genes involved in defence and immune responses, pathogenic resistance and cell development indicates that livestock grazing induces a transgenerational effect on the growth inhibition of clonal L. chinensis. The results of the present study will provide important large-scale transcriptomic information on L. chinensis. Furthermore, the results facilitated our investigation of grazing-induced transgenerational effects on both the morphological and physiological characteristics of L. chinensis at the molecular levels.",SOX9 regulated matrix proteins are increased in patients serum and correlate with severity of liver fibrosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30559459,Scientific reports,2019 03 29,"Extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition and resultant scar play a major role in the pathogenesis and progression of liver fibrosis. Identifying core regulators of ECM deposition may lead to urgently needed diagnostic and therapetic strategies for the disease. The transcription factor Sex determining region Y box 9 (SOX9) is actively involved in scar formation and its prevalence in patients with liver fibrosis predicts progression. In this study, transcriptomic approaches of Sox9-abrogated myofibroblasts identified >30% of genes regulated by SOX9 relate to the ECM. Further scrutiny of these data identified a panel of highly expressed ECM proteins, including Osteopontin (OPN), Osteoactivin (GPNMB), Fibronectin (FN1), Osteonectin (SPARC) and Vimentin (VIM) as SOX9 targets amenable to assay in patient serum. In vivo all SOX-regulated targets were increased in human disease and mouse models of fibrosis and decreased following Sox9-loss in mice with parenchymal and biliary fibrosis. In patient serum samples, SOX9-regulated ECM proteins were altered in response to fibrosis severity, whereas comparison with established clinical biomarkers demonstrated superiority for OPN and VIM at detecting early stages of fibrosis. These data support SOX9 in the mechanisms underlying fibrosis and highlight SOX9 and its downstream targets as new measures to stratify patients with liver fibrosis.",Fluidization-mediated tissue spreading by mitotic cell rounding and non-canonical Wnt signalling.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30559456,Nature cell biology,2019 04 15,"Tissue morphogenesis is driven by mechanical forces that elicit changes in cell size, shape and motion. The extent by which forces deform tissues critically depends on the rheological properties of the recipient tissue. Yet, whether and how dynamic changes in tissue rheology affect tissue morphogenesis and how they are regulated within the developing organism remain unclear. Here, we show that blastoderm spreading at the onset of zebrafish morphogenesis relies on a rapid, pronounced and spatially patterned tissue fluidization. Blastoderm fluidization is temporally controlled by mitotic cell rounding-dependent cell-cell contact disassembly during the last rounds of cell cleavages. Moreover, fluidization is spatially restricted to the central blastoderm by local activation of non-canonical Wnt signalling within the blastoderm margin, increasing cell cohesion and thereby counteracting the effect of mitotic rounding on contact disassembly. Overall, our results identify a fluidity transition mediated by loss of cell cohesion as a critical regulator of embryo morphogenesis.",Health risk stratification based on computed tomography pulmonary artery obstruction index for acute pulmonary embolism.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30559454,Scientific reports,2018 12 27,"Early effective identification of high-risk patients for acute pulmonary embolism (APE) contributes to timely treatment. The pulmonary artery obstruction index (PAOI) in computed tomography angiography (CTA) is a semi-quantitative observation index, commonly used to evaluate the severity of a patient's condition. This study explores the ability of PAOI to assess the risk stratification of APE. Thirty patients with APE were analysed. They were classified according to the guidelines, and the PAOI and cardiovascular parameters were measured in CTA. The difference of PAOI between different risk stratification patients was compared, and the predictive value of the PAOI for high-risk stratification was evaluated by the receiver operating characteristic curve. The correlation between PAOI and cardiovascular parameters was also analysed by Spearman correlation analysis. The PAOI in low- and high-risk patients was (33.2 ± 18.6)% and (68.1 ± 11.8)% respectively, and the difference was statistically significant. The PAOI was strongly predictive for high-risk patients. The cut-off value was 52.5%, with a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 81.0%. The PAOI was correlated with the main cardiovascular parameters. We conclude that the PAOI in CTA is helpful for assessing risk stratification in patients with APE, which contributes to the selection of both the treatment plan and prognostic evaluation.",Polychlorinated biphenyls reduce the kinematics contractile properties of embryonic stem cells-derived cardiomyocytes by disrupting their intracellular Ca2+ dynamics.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30559452,Scientific reports,2018 12 27,"Persistent organic pollutants are a group of chemicals that include polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). PCBs exposure during adult life increases incidence and severity of cardiomyopathies, whereas in utero exposure determines congenital heart defects. Being fat-soluble, PCBs are passed to newborns through maternal milk, impairing heart functionality in the adult. It is still unknown how PCBs impair cardiac contraction at cellular/molecular levels. Here, we study the molecular mechanisms by which PCBs cause the observed heart contraction defects, analysing the alterations of Ca2+ toolkit components that regulate contraction. We investigated the effect that Aroclor 1254 (Aroclor), a mixture of PCBs, has on perinatal-like cardiomyocytes derived from mouse embryonic stem cells. Cardiomyocytes, exposed to 1 or 2 µg/ml Aroclor for 24 h, were analyzed for their kinematics contractile properties and intracellular Ca2+ dynamics. We observed that Aroclor impairs cardiomyocytes contractile properties by inhibiting spontaneous Ca2+ oscillations. It disrupts intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis by reducing the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ content and by inhibiting voltage-gated Ca2+ entry. These findings contribute to the understanding of the molecular underpinnings of PCBs-induced cardiovascular alterations, which are emerging as an additional life-threatening hurdle associated to PCBs pollution. Therefore, PCBs-dependent alteration of intracellular Ca2+ dynamics is the most likely trigger of developmental cardiac functional alteration.","Inconsistent screening for lead endangers vulnerable children: policy lessons from South Bend and Saint Joseph County, Indiana, USA.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30559451,Journal of public health policy,2019 05 28,"Lead exposure is a major health hazard affecting children and their growth and is a concern in many urban areas around the world. One such city in the United States (US), South Bend Indiana, gained attention for its high levels of lead in blood and relatively low testing rates for children. We assessed current lead screening practices in South Bend and the surrounding St. Joseph County (SJC). The 2005-2015 lead screening data included 18,526 unique children. Lead screening rates ranged from 4.7 to 16.7%. More than 75% of children had 'elevated blood lead levels' (EBLL) ≥ 1 micrograms per deciliter (µg/Dl) and 9.7% had an EBLL ≥ 5 μg/dL. Over 65% of the census tracts in SJC had mean EBLL ≥ 5 μg/dL, suggesting widespread risk. Inconsistent lead screening rates, coupled with environmental and societal risk factors, put children in SJC at greater risk for harmful lead exposure than children living in states with provisions for universal screening. Indiana and other states should adhere to the US Centers for Disease Control's guideline and use universal lead testing to protect vulnerable populations.",The deubiquitylating enzyme UCHL3 regulates Ku80 retention at sites of DNA damage.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30559450,Scientific reports,2019 01 07,"Non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ), which can promote genomic instability when dysfunctional, is a major DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair pathway. Although ubiquitylation of the core NHEJ factor, Ku (Ku70-Ku80), which senses broken DNA ends, is important for its removal from sites of damage upon completion of NHEJ, the mechanism regulating Ku ubiquitylation remains elusive. We provide evidence showing that the ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase L3 (UCHL3) interacts with and directly deubiquitylates one of the Ku heterodimer subunits, Ku80. Additionally, depleting UCHL3 resulted in reduced Ku80 foci formation, Ku80 binding to chromatin after DSB induction, moderately sensitized cells to ionizing radiation and decreased NHEJ efficiencies. Mechanistically, we show that DNA damage induces UCHL3 phosphorylation, which is dependent on ATM, downstream NHEJ factors and UCHL3 catalytic activity. Furthermore, this phosphorylation destabilizes UCHL3, despite having no effect on its catalytic activity. Collectively, these data suggest that UCHL3 facilitates cellular viability after DSB induction by antagonizing Ku80 ubiquitylation to enhance Ku80 retention at sites of damage.",Proteasomal degradation of NOD2 by NLRP12 in monocytes promotes bacterial tolerance and colonization by enteropathogens.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30559449,Nature communications,2019 01 22,"Mutations in the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain protein 12 (NLRP12) cause recurrent episodes of serosal inflammation. Here we show that NLRP12 efficiently sequesters HSP90 and promotes K48-linked ubiquitination and degradation of NOD2 in response to bacterial muramyl dipeptide (MDP). This interaction is mediated by the linker-region proximal to the nucleotide-binding domain of NLRP12. Consequently, the disease-causing NLRP12 R284X mutation fails to repress MDP-induced NF-κB and subsequent activity of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway. While NLRP12 deficiency renders septic mice highly susceptible towards MDP, a sustained sensing of MDP through NOD2 is observed among monocytes lacking NLRP12. This loss of tolerance in monocytes results in greater colonization resistance towards Citrobacter rodentium. Our data show that this is a consequence of NOD2-dependent accumulation of inflammatory mononuclear cells that correlates with induction of interferon-stimulated genes. Our study unveils a relevant process of tolerance towards the gut microbiota that is exploited by an attaching/effacing enteric pathogen.",Synthesis and Kinetic evaluation of an azido analogue of methylerythritol phosphate: a Novel Inhibitor of E. coli YgbP/IspD.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30559447,Scientific reports,2018 12 27,"As multidrug resistant pathogenic microorganisms are a serious health menace, it is crucial to continuously develop novel medicines in order to overcome the emerging resistance.

Here, we report the synthesis and the steady-state kinetics of a novel potent inhibitor (MEPN3) of Escherichia coli YgbP/IspD, the third enzyme of the MEP pathway. MEPN3 inhibits E. coli YgbP/IspD in mixed type mode regarding both substrates. Interestingly, MEPN3 shows the highest inhibitory activity when compared to known inhibitors of E. coli YgbP/IspD.

Here, we developed and validated a capture-compound mass spectrometry approach that identified >50 putative ppGpp targets in Escherichia coli. These targets control many key cellular processes and include 13 enzymes required for nucleotide synthesis. We demonstrated that ppGpp inhibits the de novo synthesis of all purine nucleotides by directly targeting the enzyme PurF. By solving a structure of PurF bound to ppGpp, we designed a mutation that ablates ppGpp-based regulation, leading to dysregulation of purine-nucleotide synthesis following ppGpp accumulation. Collectively, our results provide new insights into ppGpp-based growth control and a nearly comprehensive set of targets for future exploration.

To enable dynamic, protein-level control over energy flow in metabolic systems for synthetic biology and bioelectronics, we created ferredoxin logic gates that utilize transcriptional and post-translational inputs to control energy flow through a synthetic electron transfer pathway that is required for bacterial growth. These logic gates were created by subjecting a thermostable, plant-type ferredoxin to backbone fission and fusing the resulting fragments to a pair of proteins that self-associate, a pair of proteins whose association is stabilized by a small molecule, and to the termini of a ligand-binding domain. We show that the latter domain insertion design strategy yields an allosteric ferredoxin switch that acquires an oxygen-tolerant [2Fe-2S] cluster and can use different chemicals, including a therapeutic drug and an environmental pollutant, to control the production of a reduced metabolite in Escherichia coli and cell lysates.",Structural basis of 7SK RNA 5'-γ-phosphate methylation and retention by MePCE.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30559425,Nature chemical biology,2019 05 11,"Among RNA 5'-cap structures, γ-phosphate monomethylation is unique to a small subset of noncoding RNAs, 7SK and U6 in humans. 7SK is capped by methylphosphate capping enzyme (MePCE), which has a second nonenzymatic role as a core component of the 7SK ribonuclear protein (RNP), an essential regulator of RNA transcription. We report 2.0- and 2.1-Å X-ray crystal structures of the human MePCE methyltransferase domain bound to S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) and uncapped or capped 7SK substrates, respectively. 7SK recognition is achieved by protein contacts to a 5'-hairpin-single-stranded RNA region, thus explaining MePCE's specificity for 7SK and U6. The structures reveal SAH and product RNA in a near-transition-state geometry. Unexpectedly, binding experiments showed that MePCE has higher affinity for capped versus uncapped 7SK, and kinetic data support a model of slow product release.

We tested the effects of N fertilisation on one N-fixing (Robinia pseudoacacia) and two non-N-fixing (Sophora japonica and Senna surattensis) woody legume species, which were subjected to five different N levels (0, 1.5, 2.9, 5.9 and 11.4 mg N per plant day-1) under greenhouse conditions. The growth of the two non-N-fixing species was promoted by N supply, while that of R. pseudoacacia was unaffected. Among the three species, R. pseudoacacia had the largest specific leaf area and chlorophyll concentration, S. japonica had the largest root-to-shoot ratio and main root-to-lateral root ratio, and S. surattensis had the largest leaf N and phosphorus concentrations. The N-fixing species was mostly unaffected by N supply. The growth, leaf chlorophyll concentration, and leaf number in the non-N-fixing species were promoted by N supply. The N-fixing species showed better growth in low-N environments, while under increased N deposition, its growth was similar to that of the non-N-fixing species.",Tumor-derived IFN triggers chronic pathway agonism and sensitivity to ADAR loss.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30559422,Nature medicine,2019 05 10,"Interferons (IFNs) are cytokines that play a critical role in limiting infectious and malignant diseases 1-4 . Emerging data suggest that the strength and duration of IFN signaling can differentially impact cancer therapies, including immune checkpoint blockade 5-7 . Here, we characterize the output of IFN signaling, specifically IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) signatures, in primary tumors from The Cancer Genome Atlas. While immune infiltration correlates with the ISG signature in some primary tumors, the existence of ISG signature-positive tumors without evident infiltration of IFN-producing immune cells suggests that cancer cells per se can be a source of IFN production. Consistent with this hypothesis, analysis of patient-derived tumor xenografts propagated in immune-deficient mice shows evidence of ISG-positive tumors that correlates with expression of human type I and III IFNs derived from the cancer cells. Mechanistic studies using cell line models from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia that harbor ISG signatures demonstrate that this is a by-product of a STING-dependent pathway resulting in chronic tumor-derived IFN production. This imposes a transcriptional state on the tumor, poising it to respond to the aberrant accumulation of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) due to increased sensor levels (MDA5, RIG-I and PKR). By interrogating our functional short-hairpin RNA screen dataset across 398 cancer cell lines, we show that this ISG transcriptional state creates a novel genetic vulnerability. ISG signature-positive cancer cells are sensitive to the loss of ADAR, a dsRNA-editing enzyme that is also an ISG. A genome-wide CRISPR genetic suppressor screen reveals that the entire type I IFN pathway and the dsRNA-activated kinase, PKR, are required for the lethality induced by ADAR depletion. Therefore, tumor-derived IFN resulting in chronic signaling creates a cellular state primed to respond to dsRNA accumulation, rendering ISG-positive tumors susceptible to ADAR loss.",Calibration of CAR activation potential directs alternative T cell fates and therapeutic potency.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30559421,Nature medicine,2019 06 10,"Chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) are synthetic receptors that target and reprogram T cells to acquire augmented antitumor properties1. CD19-specific CARs that comprise CD28 and CD3ζ signaling motifs2 have induced remarkable responses in patients with refractory leukemia3-5 and lymphoma6 and were recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration7. These CARs program highly performing effector functions that mediate potent tumor elimination4,8 despite the limited persistence they confer on T cells3-6,8. Extending their functional persistence without compromising their potency should improve current CAR therapies. Strong T cell activation drives exhaustion9,10, which may be accentuated by the redundancy of CD28 and CD3ζ signaling11,12 as well as the spatiotemporal constraints imparted by the structure of second-generation CARs2. Thus, we hypothesized that calibrating the activation potential of CD28-based CARs would differentially reprogram T cell function and differentiation. Here, we show that CARs encoding a single immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif direct T cells to different fates by balancing effector and memory programs, thereby yielding CAR designs with enhanced therapeutic profiles."

The interaction between neuroticism and serotonin during emotional processing is however not understood. Here we investigate how individual neuroticism scores influence the neural response to negative emotional faces and their sensitivity to serotonergic tone. Twenty healthy participants performed an emotional face task under functional MRI on three occasions: increased serotonin tone following infusion of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), decreased serotonin tone following acute tryptophan depletion (ATD) protocol, and no serotonin challenge (control). During the task, participants performed a gender-discrimination task of neutral, fearful or angry facial expressions. Individual variations in neuroticism scores were associated with neural response of subgenual anterior cingulate cortex to fearful facial expressions. The association was however opposite under the two serotoninergic challenges. The fear-related response in this region and individual neuroticism scores correlated negatively during citalopram challenge and positively during ATD. Thus, neuroticism scores were associated with the relative impact of serotonin challenges on fear processing in subgenual anterior cingulate cortex. This finding may link to a neural mechanism for the variable therapeutic effect of SSRI treatment observed in clinical populations.",Genomic variation and strain-specific functional adaptation in the human gut microbiome during early life.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30559407,Nature microbiology,2019 06 05,"The human gut microbiome matures towards the adult composition during the first years of life and is implicated in early immune development. Here, we investigate the effects of microbial genomic diversity on gut microbiome development using integrated early childhood data sets collected in the DIABIMMUNE study in Finland, Estonia and Russian Karelia. We show that gut microbial diversity is associated with household location and linear growth of children. Single nucleotide polymorphism- and metagenomic assembly-based strain tracking revealed large and highly dynamic microbial pangenomes, especially in the genus Bacteroides, in which we identified evidence of variability deriving from Bacteroides-targeting bacteriophages. Our analyses revealed functional consequences of strain diversity; only 10% of Finnish infants harboured Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis, a subspecies specialized in human milk metabolism, whereas Russian infants commonly maintained a probiotic Bifidobacterium bifidum strain in infancy. Groups of bacteria contributing to diverse, characterized metabolic pathways converged to highly subject-specific configurations over the first two years of life. This longitudinal study extends the current view of early gut microbial community assembly based on strain-level genomic variation.",miR-4516 predicts poor prognosis and functions as a novel oncogene via targeting PTPN14 in human glioblastoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30559405,Oncogene,2019 05 04,"Glioblastomas (GBMs) are the most aggressive primary brain tumors, with an average survival of less than 15 months. Therefore, there is a critical need to develop novel therapeutic strategies for GBM. This study aimed to assess the prognostic value of miR-4516 and investigate its oncogenic functions and the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms in GBM. To determine the correlation between miR-4516 expression and overall survival of patients with GBM, total RNAs were isolated from 268 FFPE tumor samples, miR expression was assayed (simultaneously) using the nCounter human miRNA v3a assay followed by univariable and multivariable survival analyses. Further, in vitro and in vivo studies were conducted to define the role of miR-4516 in GBM tumorigenesis and the underlying molecular mechanisms. Upon multivariable analysis, miR-4516 was correlated with poor prognosis in GBM patients (HR = 1.49, 95%CI: 1.12-1.99, P = 0.01). Interestingly, the significance of miR-4516 was retained including MGMT methylation status. Overexpression of miR-4516 significantly enhanced cell proliferation and invasion of GBM cells both in vitro and in vivo. While conducting downstream targeting studies, we found that the tumor-promoting function of miR-4516, in part, was mediated by direct targeting of PTPN14 (protein tyrosine phosphatase, non-receptor type 14) which, in turn, regulated the Hippo pathway in GBM. Taken together, our data suggest that miR-4516 represents an independent negative prognostic factor in GBM patients and acts as a novel oncogene in GBM, which regulates the PTPN14/Hippo pathway. Thus, this newly identified miR-4516 may serve as a new potential therapeutic target for GBM treatment.",Renoprotective effects of tolvaptan in hypertensive heart failure rats depend on renal decongestion.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30559403,Hypertension research : official journal of the Japanese Society of Hypertension,2019 02 14,"The vasopressin type 2 receptor antagonist tolvaptan may have renoprotective effects in patients with heart failure (HF). This study aimed to reveal the renoprotective effect of tolvaptan from the viewpoint of hemodynamic combined with catheter and ultrasound examinations in a hypertensive HF model. Dahl salt-sensitive rats (n = 24) were fed an 8% high-salt diet after the age of 6 weeks and were treated with tolvaptan (n = 16) or vehicle (control group; n = 8). The tolvaptan-treated rats were divided into two groups: a low-dose group (0.01% tolvaptan diet; Low-Tol) and a high-dose group (0.05% tolvaptan diet; High-Tol). At 24 weeks, catheterizations to measure central venous pressure (CVP) and renal medullary pressure (RMP) were performed, followed by intrarenal Doppler (IRD) studies and contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS) to evaluate renal medullary perfusion. The tolvaptan diet reduced CVP (7.7 ± 1.5, 9.0 ± 1.1, and 12.2 ± 0.8 mmHg in the High-Tol, Low-Tol, and control groups, respectively; p < 0.001) and RMP (7.7 ± 0.8, 9.4 ± 1.3, and 13.7 ± 1.2 mmHg in the High-Tol, Low-Tol, and control groups, respectively; p < 0.001). Tolvaptan also reduced the venous impedance index (VII) in the IRD analysis (0.18 ± 0.03, 0.26 ± 0.04, and 0.40 ± 0.08 in the High-Tol, Low-Tol, and control groups, respectively; p < 0.001), and the time to peak intensity in CEUS (6.0 ± 0.5, 7.3 ± 1.3, 9.8 ± 1.8 s in the High-Tol, Low-Tol, and control groups, respectively; p < 0.001).

Ccr was negatively correlated with RMP (R = -0.76, P < 0.001), the venous impedance index (R = -0.70, p < 0.001), time to peak intensity (R = -0.75, P < 0.001), and renal fibrosis (R = -0.70, p < 0.001). In contrast, Ccr had modest correlations with systolic blood pressure (R = -0.50, P = 0.02) and left ventricular ejection fraction (R = 0.48, P = 0.03).

However, the association has been inconsistent based on age, sex, body mass index, and lipid profiles. Thus, we investigated whether there is an interaction between SUA and other risk factors on incident hypertension in the Korean general population. In this study, 808 participants aged 40-79 years were included. They were free of hypertension and major cardiovascular disease at baseline. Incident hypertension was defined as systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≥ 140 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure (DBP) ≥ 90 mmHg, or use of antihypertensive medication. To investigate whether the association between SUA and incident hypertension is modified by other risk factors for hypertension, a generalized linear model and Z test were used. During the mean follow-up of 3.3 years, 11.5% of men and 10.7% of women developed hypertension. The association between SUA and incident hypertension was inconsistent according to participant age (p for interaction = 0.009). The association between SUA level and incident hypertension was positively significant among people aged < 55 years (relative risk 1.74 per 1.0 mg/dL of SUA; p = 0.002), but there was no significant association among people aged ≥ 55 years (p = 0.894). In a secondary analysis, the SUA level was not associated with an increase in SBP, but positively associated with DBP. We observed an age-differential association between SUA level and incident hypertension among Koreans. An increased SUA level can be a trigger for hypertension through early vascular changes in the middle-aged population.","Associations of growth from birth to puberty with blood pressure and lipid profile at ~17.5 years: evidence from Hong Kong's ""Children of 1997"" birth cohort.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30559401,Hypertension research : official journal of the Japanese Society of Hypertension,2019 02 14,"The role of early growth in later health is controversial. We examined the associations of growth at different phases from birth to puberty with blood pressure and lipid profile at ~17.5 years. In the population-representative ""Children of 1997"" birth cohort, growth was measured as (i) weight-for-age z score (WAZ) at birth and WAZ gains from 0 to 2 and 2 to 8 years and (ii) body-mass-index-for-age z score (BAZ) and length/height-for-age z score (LAZ) at 3 months and BAZ and LAZ gains from 3 months to 3 years, 3 to 8 years and 8 to 14 years, based on the World Health Organization growth standards/references. Adjusted partial least squares regression was used to assess simultaneously the associations of growth with height-, age- and sex-specific systolic (SBPZ) and diastolic blood pressure z scores (DBPZ), low- (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and triglycerides (TG) at ~17.5 years. Among 3410 children, higher WAZ, BAZ and LAZ gains from initial size to 8 years were associated with higher SBPZ. Higher gains in WAZ and BAZ from 2 to 8 years were consistently associated with higher DBPZ, LDL and TG and lower HDL. Lower LAZ at 3 months and higher LAZ gain from 3 months to 3 years were associated with lower HDL and higher TG. Greater growth in weight, body mass index and length/height had negative associations with blood pressure and lipid profile at ~17.5 years, but the differences by growth measure, phase and outcome suggest a complex underlying process.",Syntactic and non-syntactic sources of interference by music on language processing.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30559400,Scientific reports,2018 12 27,"Music and language are complex hierarchical systems in which individual elements are systematically combined to form larger, syntactic structures. Suggestions that music and language share syntactic processing resources have relied on evidence that syntactic violations in music interfere with syntactic processing in language. However, syntactic violations may affect auditory processing in non-syntactic ways, accounting for reported interference effects. To investigate the factors contributing to interference effects, we assessed recall of visually presented sentences and word-lists when accompanied by background auditory stimuli differing in syntactic structure and auditory distraction: melodies without violations, scrambled melodies, melodies that alternate in timbre, and environmental sounds. In Experiment 1, one-timbre melodies interfered with sentence recall, and increasing both syntactic complexity and distraction by scrambling melodies increased this interference. In contrast, three-timbre melodies reduced interference on sentence recall, presumably because alternating instruments interrupted auditory streaming, reducing pressure on long-distance syntactic structure building. Experiment 2 confirmed that participants were better at discriminating syntactically coherent one-timbre melodies than three-timbre melodies. Together, these results illustrate that syntactic processing and auditory streaming interact to influence sentence recall, providing implications for theories of shared syntactic processing and auditory distraction.",Stabilization of cytokine mRNAs in iNKT cells requires the serine-threonine kinase IRE1alpha.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30559399,Nature communications,2019 01 22,"Activated invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells rapidly produce large amounts of cytokines, but how cytokine mRNAs are induced, stabilized and mobilized following iNKT activation is still unclear. Here we show that an endoplasmic reticulum stress sensor, inositol-requiring enzyme 1α (IRE1α), links key cellular processes required for iNKT cell effector functions in specific iNKT subsets, in which TCR-dependent activation of IRE1α is associated with downstream activation of p38 MAPK and the stabilization of preformed cytokine mRNAs. Importantly, genetic deletion of IRE1α in iNKT cells reduces cytokine production and protects mice from oxazolone colitis. We therefore propose that an IRE1α-dependent signaling cascade couples constitutive cytokine mRNA expression to the rapid induction of cytokine secretion and effector functions in activated iNKT cells.","Correcting for natural isotope abundance and tracer impurity in MS-, MS/MS- and high-resolution-multiple-tracer-data from stable isotope labeling experiments with IsoCorrectoR.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30559398,Scientific reports,2018 12 27,"Experiments with stable isotope tracers such as 13C and 15N are increasingly used to gain insights into metabolism. However, mass spectrometric measurements of stable isotope labeling experiments should be corrected for the presence of naturally occurring stable isotopes and for impurities of the tracer substrate. Here, we analyzed the effect that such correction has on the data: omitting correction or performing invalid correction can result in largely distorted data, potentially leading to misinterpretation. IsoCorrectoR is the first R-based tool to offer said correction capabilities. It is easy-to-use and comprises all correction features that comparable tools can offer in a single solution: correction of MS and MS/MS data for natural stable isotope abundance and tracer impurity, applicability to any tracer isotope and correction of multiple-tracer data from high-resolution measurements. IsoCorrectoR's correction performance agreed well with manual calculations and other available tools including Python-based IsoCor and Perl-based ICT.

Water-dispersed organic semiconducting nanoparticles (NPs) satisfy these premises convincingly. However, the necessity of surfactants, which are inevitable for stabilizing NPs, is a major obstacle towards realizing competitive power conversion efficiencies for water-processed devices. Here, we report on a concept for minimizing the adverse impact of surfactants on solar cell performance. A poloxamer facilitates the purification of organic semiconducting NPs through stripping excess surfactants from aqueous dispersion. The use of surfactant-stripped NPs based on poly(3-hexylthiophene) / non-fullerene acceptor leads to a device efficiency and stability comparable to the one from devices processed by halogenated solvents. A record efficiency of 7.5% is achieved for NP devices based on a low-band gap polymer system. This elegant approach opens an avenue that future organic photovoltaics processing may be indeed based on non-toxic water-based nanoparticle inks."

Osteoporosis results in significant morbidity, but no cure has been established. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) critically contribute to bone homeostasis and possess potent immunomodulatory/anti-inflammatory capability. Here, we investigated the therapeutic efficacy of using an infusion of MSCs to treat sex hormone-deficient bone loss and its underlying mechanisms. In particular, we compared the impacts of MSC cytotherapy in the two genders with the aim of examining potential gender differences. Using the gonadectomy (GNX) model, we confirmed that the osteoporotic phenotypes were substantially consistent between female and male mice. Importantly, systemic MSC transplantation (MSCT) not only rescued trabecular bone loss in GNX mice but also restored cortical bone mass and bone quality. Unexpectedly, no differences were detected between the genders. Furthermore, MSCT demonstrated an equal efficiency in rectifying the bone remodeling balance in both genders of GNX animals, as proven by the comparable recovery of bone formation and parallel normalization of bone resorption. Mechanistically, using green fluorescent protein (GFP)-based cell-tracing, we demonstrated rapid engraftment but poor inhabitation of donor MSCs in the GNX recipient bone marrow of each gender. Alternatively, MSCT uniformly reduced the CD3+T-cell population and suppressed the serum levels of inflammatory cytokines in reversing female and male GNX osteoporosis, which was attributed to the ability of the MSC to induce T-cell apoptosis. Immunosuppression in the microenvironment eventually led to functional recovery of endogenous MSCs, which resulted in restored osteogenesis and normalized behavior to modulate osteoclastogenesis. Collectively, these data revealed recipient sexually monomorphic responses to MSC therapy in gonadal steroid deficiency-induced osteoporosis via immunosuppression/anti-inflammation and resident stem cell recovery.",Stretched and compressed exponentials in the relaxation dynamics of a metallic glass-forming melt.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30559382,Nature communications,2018 12 20,"The dynamics of glass-forming systems shows a multitude of features that are absent in normal liquids, such as non-exponential relaxation and a strong temperature-dependence of the relaxation time. Connecting these dynamic properties to the microscopic structure of the system is challenging because of the presence of the structural disorder. Here we use computer simulations of a metallic glass-former to establish such a connection. By probing the temperature and wave-vector dependence of the intermediate scattering function we find that the relaxation dynamics of the glassy melt is directly related to the local arrangement of icosahedral structures: Isolated icosahedra give rise to a liquid-like stretched exponential relaxation whereas clusters of icosahedra lead to a compressed exponential relaxation that is reminiscent to the one found in a solid. Our results show that in metallic glass-formers these two types of relaxation processes can coexist and give rise to a dynamics that is surprisingly complex.",Loss of ADAR1 in tumours overcomes resistance to immune checkpoint blockade.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30559380,Nature,2019 01 03,"Most patients with cancer either do not respond to immune checkpoint blockade or develop resistance to it, often because of acquired mutations that impair antigen presentation. Here we show that loss of function of the RNA-editing enzyme ADAR1 in tumour cells profoundly sensitizes tumours to immunotherapy and overcomes resistance to checkpoint blockade. In the absence of ADAR1, A-to-I editing of interferon-inducible RNA species is reduced, leading to double-stranded RNA ligand sensing by PKR and MDA5; this results in growth inhibition and tumour inflammation, respectively. Loss of ADAR1 overcomes resistance to PD-1 checkpoint blockade caused by inactivation of antigen presentation by tumour cells. Thus, effective anti-tumour immunity is constrained by inhibitory checkpoints such as ADAR1 that limit the sensing of innate ligands. The induction of sufficient inflammation in tumours that are sensitized to interferon can bypass the therapeutic requirement for CD8+ T cell recognition of cancer cells and may provide a general strategy to overcome immunotherapy resistance.",Observation of the nonlinear Hall effect under time-reversal-symmetric conditions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30559379,Nature,2019 02 09,"The electrical Hall effect is the production, upon the application of an electric field, of a transverse voltage under an out-of-plane magnetic field. Studies of the Hall effect have led to important breakthroughs, including the discoveries of Berry curvature and topological Chern invariants1,2. The internal magnetization of magnets means that the electrical Hall effect can occur in the absence of an external magnetic field2; this 'anomalous' Hall effect is important for the study of quantum magnets2-7. The electrical Hall effect has rarely been studied in non-magnetic materials without external magnetic fields, owing to the constraint of time-reversal symmetry. However, only in the linear response regime-when the Hall voltage is linearly proportional to the external electric field-does the Hall effect identically vanish as a result of time-reversal symmetry; the Hall effect in the nonlinear response regime is not subject to such symmetry constraints8-10. Here we report observations of the nonlinear Hall effect10 in electrical transport in bilayers of the non-magnetic quantum material WTe2 under time-reversal-symmetric conditions. We show that an electric current in bilayer WTe2 leads to a nonlinear Hall voltage in the absence of a magnetic field. The properties of this nonlinear Hall effect are distinct from those of the anomalous Hall effect in metals: the nonlinear Hall effect results in a quadratic, rather than linear, current-voltage characteristic and, in contrast to the anomalous Hall effect, the nonlinear Hall effect results in a much larger transverse than longitudinal voltage response, leading to a nonlinear Hall angle (the angle between the total voltage response and the applied electric field) of nearly 90 degrees. We further show that the nonlinear Hall effect provides a direct measure of the dipole moment10 of the Berry curvature, which arises from layer-polarized Dirac fermions in bilayer WTe2. Our results demonstrate a new type of Hall effect and provide a way of detecting Berry curvature in non-magnetic quantum materials.",Quantum Hall effect based on Weyl orbits in Cd3As2.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30559378,Nature,2019 02 09,"Discovered decades ago, the quantum Hall effect remains one of the most studied phenomena in condensed matter physics and is relevant for research areas such as topological phases, strong electron correlations and quantum computing1-5. The quantized electron transport that is characteristic of the quantum Hall effect typically originates from chiral edge states-ballistic conducting channels that emerge when two-dimensional electron systems are subjected to large magnetic fields2. However, whether the quantum Hall effect can be extended to higher dimensions without simply stacking two-dimensional systems is unknown. Here we report evidence of a new type of quantum Hall effect, based on Weyl orbits in nanostructures of the three-dimensional topological semimetal Cd3As2. The Weyl orbits consist of Fermi arcs (open arc-like surface states) on opposite surfaces of the sample connected by one-dimensional chiral Landau levels along the magnetic field through the bulk6,7. This transport through the bulk results in an additional contribution (compared to stacked two-dimensional systems and which depends on the sample thickness) to the quantum phase of the Weyl orbit. Consequently, chiral states can emerge even in the bulk. To measure these quantum phase shifts and search for the associated chiral modes in the bulk, we conduct transport experiments using wedge-shaped Cd3As2 nanostructures with variable thickness. We find that the quantum Hall transport is strongly modulated by the sample thickness. The dependence of the Landau levels on the magnitude and direction of the magnetic field and on the sample thickness agrees with theoretical predictions based on the modified Lifshitz-Onsager relation for the Weyl orbits. Nanostructures of topological semimetals thus provide a way of exploring quantum Hall physics in three-dimensional materials with enhanced tunability.",m6A modification controls the innate immune response to infection by targeting type I interferons.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30559377,Nature immunology,2019 05 06,"N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most common mRNA modification. Recent studies have revealed that depletion of m6A machinery leads to alterations in the propagation of diverse viruses. These effects were proposed to be mediated through dysregulated methylation of viral RNA. Here we show that following viral infection or stimulation of cells with an inactivated virus, deletion of the m6A 'writer' METTL3 or 'reader' YTHDF2 led to an increase in the induction of interferon-stimulated genes. Consequently, propagation of different viruses was suppressed in an interferon-signaling-dependent manner. Significantly, the mRNA of IFNB, the gene encoding the main cytokine that drives the type I interferon response, was m6A modified and was stabilized following repression of METTL3 or YTHDF2. Furthermore, we show that m6A-mediated regulation of interferon genes was conserved in mice. Together, our findings uncover the role m6A serves as a negative regulator of interferon response by dictating the fast turnover of interferon mRNAs and consequently facilitating viral propagation.",Isotope-dilution mass spectrometry for exact quantification of noncanonical DNA nucleosides.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30559375,Nature protocols,2019 04 18,"DNA contains not only canonical nucleotides but also a variety of modifications of the bases. In particular, cytosine and adenine are frequently modified. Determination of the exact quantity of these noncanonical bases can contribute to the characterization of the state of a biological system, e.g., determination of disease or developmental processes, and is therefore extremely important. Here, we present a workflow that includes detailed description of critical sample preparation steps and important aspects of mass spectrometry analysis and validation. In this protocol, extraction and digestion of DNA by an optimized spin-column and enzyme-based method are described. Isotopically labeled standards are added in the course of DNA digestion, which allows exact quantification by isotope dilution mass spectrometry. To overcome the major bottleneck of such analyses, we developed a short (~14-min-per-sample) ultra-HPLC (UHPLC) and triple quadrupole mass spectrometric (QQQ-MS) method. Easy calculation of the modification abundance in the genome is possible with the provided evaluation sheets. Compared to alternative methods, the quantification procedure presented here allows rapid, ultrasensitive (low femtomole range) and highly reproducible quantification of different nucleosides in parallel. Including sample preparation and evaluation, quantification of DNA modifications can be achieved in less than a week.",Quantitative cross-linking/mass spectrometry to elucidate structural changes in proteins and their complexes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30559374,Nature protocols,2019 04 18,"Quantitative cross-linking/mass spectrometry (QCLMS/QXL-MS) probes structural changes of proteins in solution. This method has revealed induced conformational changes, composition shifts in conformational ensembles and changes in protein interactions. It illuminates different structural states of proteins or protein complexes by comparing which residue pairs can be cross-linked in these states. Cross-links provide information about structural changes that may be inaccessible by alternative technologies. Small local conformational changes affect relative abundances of nearby cross-links, whereas larger conformational changes cause new cross-links to be formed. Distinguishing between minor and major changes requires a robust analysis based on carefully selected replicates and, when using isotope-labeled cross-linkers, replicated analysis with a permutated isotope-labeling scheme. A label-free workflow allows for application of a wide range of cross-linking chemistries and enables parallel comparison of multiple conformations. In this protocol, we demonstrate both label-free and isotope-labeled cross-linker-based workflows using the cross-linker bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate (BS3). The software XiSearch, developed by our group, is used to identify cross-linked residue pairs, although the workflow is not limited to this search software. The open-access software Skyline is used for automated quantitation. Note that additional manual correction greatly enhances quantitation accuracy. The protocol has been applied to purified multi-protein complexes but is not necessarily limited to that level of sample complexity. Optimizing the cross-linker/protein ratio and fractionating peptides increase the data density of quantified cross-links, and thus the resolution of QCLMS. The entire procedure takes ~1-3 weeks.",CRISPR-Cas9 genome engineering of primary CD4+ T cells for the interrogation of HIV-host factor interactions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30559373,Nature protocols,2019 06 10,"CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing strategies have revolutionized our ability to engineer the human genome for robust functional interrogation of complex biological processes. We have recently adapted this technology for use in primary human CD4+ T cells to create a high-throughput platform for analyzing the role of host factors in HIV infection and pathogenesis. Briefly, CRISPR-Cas9 ribonucleoproteins (crRNPs) are synthesized in vitro and delivered to activated CD4+ T cells by nucleofection. These cells are then assayed for editing efficiency and expanded for use in downstream cellular, genetic, or protein-based assays. This platform supports the rapid, arrayed generation of multiple gene manipulations and is widely adaptable across culture conditions, infection protocols, and downstream applications. Here, we present detailed protocols for crRNP synthesis, primary T-cell culture, 96-well nucleofection, molecular validation, and HIV infection, and discuss additional considerations for guide and screen design, as well as crRNP multiplexing. Taken together, this procedure allows high-throughput identification and mechanistic interrogation of HIV host factors in primary CD4+ T cells by gene knockout, validation, and HIV spreading infection in as little as 2-3 weeks.",Transcriptome profiling of human oocytes experiencing recurrent total fertilization failure.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30559372,Scientific reports,2018 12 27,"There exist some patients who face recurrent total fertilization failure during assisted reproduction treatment, but the pathological mechanism underlying is elusive. Here, by using sc-RNA-seq method, the transcriptome profiles of ten abnormally fertilized zygotes were assessed, including five zygotes from one patient with recurrent Poly-PN zygotes, and five zygotes from a patient with pronuclear fusion failure. Four zygotes with three pronuclear (Tri-PN) were collected from four different patients as controls. After that, we identified 951 and 1697 significantly differentially expressed genes (SDEGs) in Poly-PN and PN arrest zygotes, respectively as compared with the control group. KEGG analyses indicated down regulated genes in the Poly-PN group included oocyte meiosis related genes, such as PPP2R1B, YWHAZ, MAD2L1, SPDYC, SKP1 and CDC27, together with genes associated with RNA processing, such as SF3B1, LOC645691, MAGOHB, PHF5A, PRPF18, DDX5, THOC1 and BAT1. In contrast, down regulated genes in the PN arrest group, included cell cycle genes, such as E2F4, DBF4, YWHAB, SKP2, CDC23, SMC3, CDC25A, CCND3, BUB1B, MDM2, CCNA2 and CDC7, together with homologous recombination related genes, such as NBN, XRCC3, SHFM1, RAD54B and RAD51. Thus, our work provides a better understanding of transcriptome profiles underlying RTFF, although it based on a limited number of patients."

The serotonin system recently emerged as an important player in the regulation of vascular tone in humans. However, hyperreactivity to serotonin appears to be a critical factor for the pathophysiology of hypertension. In this study, we examined the modulatory mechanisms of estrogen in serotonin-induced vasoconstriction by using a combinatory approach of isometric tension measurements, molecular biology, and patch-clamp techniques. 17β-Estradiol (E2) elicited a significant and concentration-dependent relaxation of serotonin-induced contraction in deendothelialized aortic strips isolated from male rats. E2 triggered a relaxation of serotonin-induced contraction even in the presence of tamoxifen, an estrogen receptor antagonist, suggesting that E2-induced changes are not mediated by estrogen receptor. Patch-clamp studies in rat arterial myocytes showed that E2 prevented Kv channel inhibition induced by serotonin. Serotonin increased Src activation in arterial smooth muscle required for contraction, which was significantly inhibited by E2. The estrogen receptor-independent inhibition of Src by E2 was confirmed in HEK293T cells that do not express estrogen receptor. Taken together, these results suggest that estrogen exerts vasodilatory effects on serotonin-precontracted arteries via Src, implying a critical role for estrogen in the prevention of vascular hyperreactivity to serotonin.",In vitro Chondrocyte Responses in Mg-doped Wollastonite/Hydrogel Composite Scaffolds for Osteochondral Interface Regeneration.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30559344,Scientific reports,2018 12 27,"The zone of calcified cartilage (ZCC) is the mineralized region between the hyaline cartilage and subchondral bone and is critical in cartilage repair. A new non-stoichiometric calcium silicate (10% Ca substituted by Mg; CSi-Mg10) has been demonstrated to be highly bioactive in an osteogenic environment in vivo. This study is aimed to systematically evaluate the potential to regenerate osteochondral interface with different amount of Ca-Mg silicate in hydrogel-based scaffolds, and to compare with the scaffolds containing conventional Ca-phosphate biomaterials. Hydrogel-based porous scaffolds combined with 0-6% CSi-Mg10, 6% β-tricalcium phosphate (β-TCP) or 6% nanohydroxyapatite (nHAp) were made with three-dimensional (3D) printing. An increase in CSi-Mg10 content is desirable for promoting the hypertrophy and mineralization of chondrocytes, as well as cell proliferation and matrix deposition. Osteogenic and chondrogenic induction were both up-regulated in a dose-dependent manner. In comparison with the scaffolds containing 6% β-TCP or nHAp, human deep zone chondrocytes (hDZCs) seeded on CSi-Mg10 scaffold of equivalent concentration exhibited higher mineralization. It is noteworthy that the hDZCs in the 6% CSi-Mg10 scaffolds maintained a higher expression of the calcified cartilage zone specific extracellular matrix marker and hypertrophic marker, collagen type X. Immunohistochemical and Alizarin Red staining reconfirmed these findings. The study demonstrated that hydrogel-based hybrid scaffolds containing 6% CSi-Mg10 are particularly desirable for inducing the formation of calcified cartilage.",Costs and benefits of Papacarie in pediatric dentistry: a randomized clinical trial.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30559343,Scientific reports,2018 12 27,"Papacarie gel is an agent that eliminates the need for local anesthesia and reduces the need for using a drill. However, there is no information regarding the cost per procedure. Therefore we analyzed the cost, per procedure, of Papacarie gel compared to the traditional method (drilling), and performed a comparison between these methods of carious tissue removal. A randomized clinical trial was performed with 24 children with an average age of 5.9 years old. Of these children, 12 were boys and 12 were girls, which resulted in a total of 46 restorations. Patients were separated into: Papacarie group (caries removal with the chemical-mechanical method - Papacarie gel) and Drill group (caries removal with the traditional method - drilling). Values of the materials used in the procedures, heart rate (before, 5 minutes during, and after dental treatment), and the total consultation duration were recorded. A level of significance of 5% was adopted. Papacarie had a lower cost per procedure ($ 0.91) when compared to the traditional method ($ 1.58). Papacarie provided a cost reduction of 42% compared to the traditional method. Using local anesthesia ($ 2.17), the cost reduction increased to 58%. In the procedure using drill + Papacarie ($ 1.37), the cost reduction was 33%. Heart rate, consultation duration, and number of restorations were not statistically different. Papacarie shows an excellent cost benefit for minimally invasive removal of carious tissue and is a feasible alternative for public health care.",Structural basis of meiotic telomere attachment to the nuclear envelope by MAJIN-TERB2-TERB1.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30559341,Nature communications,2019 02 26,"Meiotic chromosomes undergo rapid prophase movements, which are thought to facilitate the formation of inter-homologue recombination intermediates that underlie synapsis, crossing over and segregation. The meiotic telomere complex (MAJIN, TERB1, TERB2) tethers telomere ends to the nuclear envelope and transmits cytoskeletal forces via the LINC complex to drive these rapid movements. Here, we report the molecular architecture of the meiotic telomere complex through the crystal structure of MAJIN-TERB2, together with light and X-ray scattering studies of wider complexes. The MAJIN-TERB2 2:2 hetero-tetramer binds strongly to DNA and is tethered through long flexible linkers to the inner nuclear membrane and two TRF1-binding 1:1 TERB2-TERB1 complexes. Our complementary structured illumination microscopy studies and biochemical findings reveal a telomere attachment mechanism in which MAJIN-TERB2-TERB1 recruits telomere-bound TRF1, which is then displaced during pachytene, allowing MAJIN-TERB2-TERB1 to bind telomeric DNA and form a mature attachment plate.",Electron aspirator using electron-electron scattering in nanoscale silicon.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30559340,Nature communications,2018 12 20,"Current enhancement without increasing the input power is a critical issue to be pursued for electronic circuits. However, drivability of metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) transistors is limited by the source-injection current, and electrons that have passed through the source unavoidably waste their momentum to the phonon bath. Here, we propose the Si electron-aspirator, a nanometer-scaled MOS device with a T-shaped branch, to go beyond this limit. The device utilizes the hydrodynamic nature of electrons due to the electron-electron scattering, by which the injected hot electrons transfer their momentum to cold electrons before they relax with the phonon bath. This momentum transfer induces an electron flow from the grounded side terminal without additional power sources. The operation is demonstrated by observing the output-current enhancement by a factor of about 3 at 8 K, which reveals that the electron-electron scattering can govern the electron transport in nanometer-scaled MOS devices, and increase their effective drivability.",Lysosomal protease deficiency or substrate overload induces an oxidative-stress mediated STAT3-dependent pathway of lysosomal homeostasis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30559339,Nature communications,2019 01 22,"Diverse cellular processes depend on the lysosomal protease system but how cells regulate lysosomal proteolytic capacity is only partly understood. We show here that cells can respond to protease/substrate imbalance in this compartment by de novo expression of multiple lysosomal hydrolases. This response, exemplified here either by loss of asparagine endopeptidase (AEP) or other lysosomal cysteine proteases, or by increased endocytic substrate load, is not dependent on the transcription factor EB (TFEB) but rather is triggered by STAT3 activation downstream of lysosomal oxidative stress. Similar lysosomal adaptations are seen in mice and cells expressing a constitutively active form of STAT3. Our results reveal how cells can increase lysosomal protease capacity under 'fed' rather than 'starved' conditions that activate the TFEB system. In addition, STAT3 activation due to lysosomal stress likely explains the hyperproliferative kidney disease and splenomegaly observed in AEP-deficient mice.",Myopathy associated BAG3 mutations lead to protein aggregation by stalling Hsp70 networks.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30559338,Nature communications,2019 06 10,"BAG3 is a multi-domain hub that connects two classes of chaperones, small heat shock proteins (sHSPs) via two isoleucine-proline-valine (IPV) motifs and Hsp70 via a BAG domain. Mutations in either the IPV or BAG domain of BAG3 cause a dominant form of myopathy, characterized by protein aggregation in both skeletal and cardiac muscle tissues. Surprisingly, for both disease mutants, impaired chaperone binding is not sufficient to explain disease phenotypes. Recombinant mutants are correctly folded, show unaffected Hsp70 binding but are impaired in stimulating Hsp70-dependent client processing. As a consequence, the mutant BAG3 proteins become the node for a dominant gain of function causing aggregation of itself, Hsp70, Hsp70 clients and tiered interactors within the BAG3 interactome. Importantly, genetic and pharmaceutical interference with Hsp70 binding completely reverses stress-induced protein aggregation for both BAG3 mutations. Thus, the gain of function effects of BAG3 mutants act as Achilles heel of the HSP70 machinery.",Interleukin-37 (IL-37) Suppresses Pertussis Toxin-Induced Inflammatory Myopathy in a Rat Model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30559337,Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research,2019 03 04,"BACKGROUND Recent data have demonstrated the potential immunosuppressive roles of interleukin-37 (IL-37) in several diseases, but whether it is involved in the pathogenesis of inflammatory myopathy has not been elucidated. MATERIAL AND METHODS An experimental autoimmune myositis (EAM) model was built by subcutaneous injections of pertussis toxin (PTX) and purified rabbit myosin (10mg/kg) emulsified with an equal volume of conventional complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) in a Lewis model. Autoimmune myositis Lewis model rats were divided into 3 groups: group A rats (control group) were injected with CFA in saline weekly; group B (IL-37 group) rats were injected with saline with IL-37 and CFA in saline weekly; and group C (IL-37 + SIS3 group) rats were injected with IL-37, CFA, and SIS3. ELISA was also used to assess the expressions of TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, TGF-β1, and CK. HE staining was performed to assess pathological changes in lung and muscle tissues. RESULTS The expressions of TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, TGF-β1, and CK significantly increased in autoimmune myositis Lewis model rats. After IL-37 treatment, the expression of TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, TGF-β1, and CK was significantly reduced, as were the inflammatory responses of lung and muscle. However, SIS3 reduced the effects of IL-37 on the autoimmune myositis Lewis model rats. CONCLUSIONS These findings indicate that IL-37 protects against inflammatory response via regulating Smad3 in autoimmune myositis Lewis model rats.",Pulmonary Artery Systolic Pressure Measured Intraoperatively by Right Heart Catheterization Is a Predictor of Kidney Transplant Recipient Survival.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30559336,Annals of transplantation,2019 04 11,"BACKGROUND The effect of pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP) measured by Swan-Ganz right heart catheter (SG-RHC) on kidney transplant recipient survival has not been previously studied. The objective of this study was to assess the relationships between PASP measured via SG-RHC, done intraoperatively at the time of initiating anesthesia at the beginning of kidney transplant surgery, and patient survival. Multiple comorbidities, time on dialysis before the transplantation, and graft function were also analyzed in our study. MATERIAL AND METHODS This was a retrospective cohort study using data from all consecutive patients undergoing kidney transplant between January 1, 2005 and December 31, 2009 at Tampa General Hospital. Kidney transplant recipients were divided into 2 groups: Group 1 with PASP <35 mmHg and group 2 with PASP ≥35 mmHg. Patients and graft survival data, time on dialysis before transplant, and comorbidities were compared between the 2 groups. RESULTS Only 363 patients were found to have a documented PASP measurement at the time of anesthesia induction for the transplant surgery, and were included in the specific analysis of our study. Patients with PASP ≥35 mmHg showed a significant decrease in survival in comparison to patients having PASP values <35 mmHg (HR 1.88; 95% CI 1.012 to 3.47, P=0.04). There was a significant positive correlation between time on dialysis and PASP (rho 0.20; 95% CI 0.09 to 0.30, p<0.001), as well as a significant difference in median time on dialysis between PASP <35 vs. PASP ≥35 (22 vs. 29 months, p=0.004). There were no significant differences in graft failure between the 2 PASP groups (HR 0.34; 95% CI 0.12 to 1.01, P=0.05). CONCLUSIONS Patients with PASP ≥35 mmHg, measured intraoperatively by SG-RHC, showed significantly shorter survival in comparison to patients having PASP values <35 mmHg. This result suggests the need for a randomized controlled trial to address the importance of post-transplant pulmonary hypertension management in patient survival.","Murine Typhus: A Life-Threatening Presentation of a Case in Galveston, Texas.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30559335,The American journal of case reports,2019 03 26,"BACKGROUND Murine typhus is a rare bacterial infection caused by Rickettsia typhi, which is transmitted from rodents to humans through the infected Xenopsylla cheopis flea. The disease presentation is often non-specific, leading to unnecessary tests, and a delay in diagnosis and treatment. CASE REPORT A report is presented of a 22-year-old, previously healthy man, who presented with several symptoms and signs that increased in severity, requiring admission to the medical intensive care unit (MICU). After an extensive bacterial and viral laboratory workup, IgM and IgG titers confirmed the diagnosis of murine typhus due to infection by Rickettsia typhi. The patient was treated with doxycycline, which resulted in significant clinical improvement. CONCLUSIONS Murine typhus can present with a characteristic triad of fever, headache, and rash but also with other symptoms and signs and can vary in severity. Given its increasing prevalence in coastal cities, awareness of this infection and early diagnosis and treatment with doxycycline can reduce patient morbidity."
