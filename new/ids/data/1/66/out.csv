While bacterial identification has been greatly accelerated by the introduction of matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS), the antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST) remains time-consuming. Here, we present a rapid susceptibility testing method for testing Gram-negative bacteria, exemplarily validated for Escherichia coli and Klebsiella spp. Methods Gram-negative isolates (E. coli and Klebsiella spp.) were either taken as single colonies from agar plates (n=136) or directly extracted and identified from positive blood cultures (n=42) using MALDI-TOF MS. Bacteria were incubated in glucose-supplemented Luria broths (LBs) each containing one antibiotic (ceftazidime, piperacillin, imipenem and ciprofloxacin), routinely used to classify Gram-negative bacteria in Germany. To determine susceptibility the dynamics of glucose utilization in bacterial suspensions were quantitatively measured in the presence or absence of antibiotics designated liquid-AST (L-AST). Results The L-AST can be run on clinical-chemistry analyzers and integrated into laboratory routines. It yields critical resistance information within 90-150 min downstream of a MS-based identification. The results showed a high concordance with routine susceptibility testing, with less than 1% very major errors (VME) and 3.51% major errors (ME) for 178 assessed isolates. Analysis of turnaround time (TAT) for 42 clinical samples indicated that L-AST results could be obtained 34 h earlier than the routine results. Conclusions As exemplified for E. coli and Klebsiella spp., L-AST provides substantial acceleration of susceptibility testing following MALDI-TOF MS identification. The assay is a simple and low-cost method that can be integrated into clinical laboratory to allow for 24/7 AST. This approach could improve antibiotic therapy.",Accuracy assessment of consecutive test strip lots for whole blood INR point-of-care instruments: clarifying the role of frozen plasma pools.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30763258,Clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine,2019 02 14,"Background In the Netherlands, each new lot of test strips for the CoaguChek XS is validated by a group of collaborating centers. The purpose of this study was to assess the accuracy of the international normalized ratio (INR) measured with consecutive test strip lots and the suitability of frozen plasma pools for accuracy evaluation. Methods Each year, a particular lot of CoaguChek XS test strips is used as reference lot. The reference lots have been validated with the International Standard for thromboplastin rTF/09, yielding a mathematical relationship (R1) between reference lot INR and International Standard INR. New lots are compared to the reference lot using patients' capillary blood samples, yielding a relationship (R2) between the new lot INR and the reference lot INR. INRs of the blood samples were within the 1.5-4.5 interval. In parallel, three frozen plasmas pools are analyzed with the test strips. The distance of each plasma point to the line of relationship R2 was assessed. Results Fifty-four test strip lots have been evaluated during 3 years (2014-2016). Mean INR differences between test strip lot and International Standard rTF/09 varied between -0.14 and +0.20 (-4% and +8%, respectively). A positive trend with strip lot sequence number was observed (p<0.001). In several cases, the distance of the frozen plasmas to the whole blood relationship (R2) was greater than the critical value for commutability. Conclusions Using whole blood, all evaluated test strip lots met the analytical bias criterion of ±10%. Frozen plasma pools behave differently compared to whole blood and are not suitable for assessing absolute accuracy of new CoaguChek XS test strips.",Evaluating the diagnostic and prognostic value of serum long non-coding RNA CTC-497E21.4 in gastric cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30763257,Clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine,2019 06 02,"Background Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been reported to play a key role in gastric cancer (GC) tumorigenesis. However, the clinical application value of serum lncRNAs in GC has remained largely unknown. We investigated the role of a novel lncRNA named CTC-497E21.4 in the diagnosis and the prognosis of GC. Methods We focused on evaluation of lncRNA CTC-497E21.4 by real-time fluorescent quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RTFQ-PCR). The study involved following aspects: (1) confirmation of the higher lncRNA CTC-497E21.4 expression in different types of GC specimens than corresponding controls; (2) evaluation of monitoring tumor dynamics by the serum lncRNA CTC-497E21.4 assay; (3) evaluation of the prognostic value of lncRNA CTC-497E21.4 assay in GC. Results (1) The method of RTFQ-PCR detection of lncRNA CTC-497E21.4 was evaluated to have high sensitivity and specificity. (2) The expression levels of lncRNA CTC-497E21.4 were higher in GC patients compared with corresponding controls (p<0.001), and the combination of serum lncRNA CTC-497E21.4, CEA and CA19-9 could improve diagnostic sensitivity (96.36%). (3) The serum lncRNA CTC-497E21.4 expression levels were lower in postoperative samples than preoperative samples (p=0.0021) and survival curves downloaded from TCGA showed high lncRNA CTC-497E21.4 levels were associated with poor OS of GC (p=0.0351). Conclusions lncRNA CTC-497E21.4 may be a potential biomarker for the diagnosis and the prognosis of GC.",Nm23-H1 inhibits hypoxia induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition and stemness in non-small cell lung cancer cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30763256,Biological chemistry,2019 05 10,"The Nm23 gene has been acknowledged to play a crucial role in lung cancer metastasis inhibitory cascades controlled by multiple factors. Low expression or allelic deletion of nm23-H1 is strongly linked to widespread metastasis and poor differentiation of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In this study, nm23-H1 was down regulated in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and stemness enhancement under cobalt chloride (CoCl2)-induced hypoxia in NSCLC cells. Moreover, knocking down of nm23-H1 by shRNA apparently promoted hypoxia induced EMT and stemness, which was entirely suppressed via over expression of nm23-H1. Mechanistically, the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway was found to participate in the nm23-H1-mediated process. Besides, XAV939 prohibited cell EMT and stemness which could be impaired by knocking down of nm23-H1, while stable transfection of nm23-H1 attenuated hypoxia phonotype induced by lithium chloride (LiCl). Generally, our experiment provided evidence that nm23-H1 can reverse hypoxia induced EMT and stemness through the inhibition of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, which may furnish a deeper perspective into the better treatment or prognosis for NSCLC.",Google Trends Predicts Present and Future Plague Cases During the Plague Outbreak in Madagascar: Infodemiological Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30763255,JMIR public health and surveillance,2019 04 18,"Plague is a highly infectious zoonotic disease caused by the bacillus Yersinia pestis. Three major forms of the disease are known: bubonic, septicemic, and pneumonic plague. Though highly related to the past, plague still represents a global public health concern. Cases of plague continue to be reported worldwide. In recent months, pneumonic plague cases have been reported in Madagascar. However, despite such a long-standing and rich history, it is rather difficult to get a comprehensive overview of the general situation. Within the framework of electronic health (eHealth), in which people increasingly search the internet looking for health-related material, new information and communication technologies could enable researchers to get a wealth of data, which could complement traditional surveillance of infectious diseases.",The Relationship Between Nomophobia and Maladaptive Coping Styles in a Sample of Italian Young Adults: Insights and Implications From a Cross-Sectional Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30763254,JMIR mental health,2019 06 10,"Information technologies have become an integral part of the modern society; however, it is speculated that their overuse would result in addiction.

The proposed method defines a smooth and differentiable function to replace probabilistic constraints by the deterministic ones, thereby converting the chance-constrained trajectory optimization model into a parametric nonlinear programming model. In addition, it is proved that the approximation function and the corresponding approximation set will converge to that of the original problem. Furthermore, the optimal solution of the approximated model is ensured to converge to the optimal solution of the original problem. Numerical results, obtained from a new chance-constrained space vehicle trajectory optimization model and a 3-D unmanned vehicle trajectory smoothing problem, verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach. Comparative studies were also carried out to show the proposed design can yield good performance and outperform other typical chance-constrained optimization techniques investigated in this paper.",A New Method for Topology Identification of Complex Dynamical Networks.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30763252,IEEE transactions on cybernetics,2019 02 14,"Topology identification of complex dynamical networks received extensive attention in the past decade. Most existing studies rely heavily on the linear independence condition (LIC). We find that a critical step in using this condition is not rigorous. Besides, it is difficult to verify this condition. Without regulating the original network, possible identification failure caused by network synchronization cannot be avoided. In this paper, we propose a new method to overcome these shortcomings. We add a regulation mechanism to the original network and construct an auxiliary network consisting of isolated nodes. Along with the outer synchronization between the regulated network and the auxiliary network, we show that the original network can be identified. Our method can avoid identification failure caused by network synchronization. Moreover, we show that there is no need to check the LIC. We finally provide some examples to demonstrate that our method is reliable and has good performances.",Output Feedback Stabilization of Networked Control Systems Under a Stochastic Scheduling Protocol.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30763251,IEEE transactions on cybernetics,2019 02 14,"This paper investigates the output feedback stabilization problem for networked control systems under a stochastic scheduling protocol. First, an independent and identically distributed (i.i.d) scheduling protocol is introduced to orchestrate the signal transmission via a communication network. Taking into account the i.i.d protocol, network-induced delay, and packet dropout, a stochastic impulsive delayed model is presented for the studied system. Second, by use of the Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional approach, sufficient conditions for guaranteeing the stability of the studied system in the mean-square sense are obtained in the form of matrix inequalities. Moreover, an optimization algorithm is investigated to obtain the suitable dynamic output feedback controller and optimal i.i.d protocol parameters simultaneously. Finally, two numerical examples are presented to show the validity of the proposed method.",Detection and Control of Unannounced Exercise in the Artificial Pancreas without Additional Physiological Signals.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30763250,IEEE journal of biomedical and health informatics,2019 02 22,"The purpose of this study was to develop an algorithm that detects aerobic exercise and triggers disturbance rejection actions to prevent exercise-induced hypoglycemia. This approach can provide a solution to poor glycemic control during and after aerobic exercise, a major hindrance in the participation of exercise by patients with type 1 diabetes. This novel exercise-induced hypoglycemia reduction algorithm (EHRA) detects exercise using a threshold on a disturbance term, a parameter estimated from an augmented minimal model using an Unscented Kalman Filter. After detection, the EHRA triggers three actions: 1) a carbohydrate suggestion, 2) a reduction in basal insulin and the insulin-on-board maximum limit, and 3) a 30% reduction of the next insulin meal bolus. The EHRA was tested in silico using a 15-day scenario with 8 exercise sessions of 50 min at 60% VO2max on alternating days. The EHRA was able to obtain improved results when compared to strategies with and without exercise announcement. The unannounced, announced, and EHRA strategies all obtained an overall percentage of time in range (70-180 mg/dl) of 94% and a percentage of time <70 mg/dl of 2%, 0% and 0%, respectively. The EHRA was tested for robustness during exercise sessions of +25% and -25% intensity and results suggest that the EHRA is able to account for variability in exercise intensity, duration, and patient dynamics such as glucose uptake rate and insulin sensitivity."

The distance defined in a shape space may provide a simple and refined index to represent a unique shape. This work studies the Wasserstein space and proposes a novel framework to compute the Wasserstein distance between general topological surfaces by integrating hyperbolic Ricci flow, hyperbolic harmonic map, and hyperbolic power Voronoi diagram algorithms. The resulting hyperbolic Wasserstein distance can intrinsically measure the similarity between general topological surfaces. Our proposed algorithms are theoretically rigorous and practically efficient. It has the potential to be a powerful tool for 3D shape indexing research.

Therefore, FES provides a promising technology for assisting upper-limb motor functions in rehabilitation following stroke. However, the full benefits of FES may be limited due to lack of a systematic approach to formulate the pattern of stimulation. Our preliminary work demonstrated that it is feasible to use muscle synergy to guide the generation of FES patterns.In this paper, we present a methodology of formulating FES patterns based on muscle synergies of a normal subject using a programmable multi-channel FES device. The effectiveness of the synergy-based FES was tested in two sets of experiments. In experiment one, the instantaneous effects of FES to improve movement kinematics were tested in three patients post ischemic stroke. Patients performed frontal reaching and lateral reaching tasks, which involved coordinated movements in the elbow and shoulder joints. The FES pattern was adjusted in amplitude and time profile for each subject in each task. In experiment two, a 5-day session of intervention using synergy-based FES was delivered to another three patients, in which patients performed task-oriented training in the same reaching movements in one-hour-per-day dose. The outcome of the short-term intervention was measured by changes in Fugl-Meyer scores and movement kinematics. Results on instantaneous effects showed that FES assistance was effective to increase the peak hand velocity in both or one of the tasks. In short-term intervention, evaluations prior to and post intervention showed improvements in both Fugl-Meyer scores and movement kinematics. The muscle synergy of patients also tended to evolve towards that of the normal subject. These results provide promising evidence of benefits using synergy-based FES for upper-limb rehabilitation following stroke. This is the first step towards a clinical protocol of applying FES as therapeutic intervention in stroke rehabilitation.",Optimizing robust PID control of propofol anesthesia for children; design and clinical evaluation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30763237,IEEE transactions on bio-medical engineering,2019 02 14,"The goal of this study was to optimize robust PID control for propofol anesthesia in children aged 5-10 years to improve performance, particularly to decrease the time of induction of anesthesia while maintaining robustness.",The effect of recurrent direct vision internal urethrotomy for short anterior urethral strictures on the disease course and the predictors of treatment failure.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30763233,Canadian Urological Association journal = Journal de l'Association des urologues du Canada,2019 02 14,The objective of this study was to investigate the disease course after direct vision internal urethrotomy (DVIU) for short anterior urethral strictures.,Laparoscopic pyeloplasty practice patterns in Canada.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30763231,Canadian Urological Association journal = Journal de l'Association des urologues du Canada,2019 02 14,"Ureteropelvic junction obstruction (UPJO) is a condition characterized by partial or complete obstruction of urine transport from the renal pelvis to the ureter and can present with intermittent flank pain, recurrent urinary tract infections, renal stones, or renal dysfunction.

However, recent research suggests that prolonged sedentary behavior might abolish these healthy metabolic benefits. Accordingly, this study aimed to elucidate the impact of an acute bout of exercise on postprandial plasma triglyceride, glucose, and insulin concentrations after 4 days of prolonged sitting (~13.5 h/day). Ten untrained to recreationally active men (n = 5) and women (n = 5) completed a counterbalanced, crossover study. Four days of prolonged sitting without exercise (SIT) were compared with 4 days of prolonged sitting with a 1-h bout of treadmill exercise (SIT + EX; 63.1 ± 5.2% V̇o2max) on the evening of the fourth day. The following morning, participants completed a high-fat/glucose tolerance test (HFGTT), during which plasma was collected over a 6-h period and analyzed for triglycerides, glucose, and insulin. No differences between trials (P > 0.05) were found in the overall plasma triglyceride, glucose, or insulin responses during the HFGTT. This lack of difference between trials comes with similarly low physical activity (~3,500-4,000 steps/day) on each day except for the 1-h bout of exercise during SIT + EX the day before the HFGTT. These data indicate that physical inactivity (e.g., sitting ~13.5 h/day and <4,000 steps/day) creates a condition whereby people become ""resistant"" to the metabolic improvements that are typically derived from an acute bout of aerobic exercise (i.e., exercise resistance). NEW & NOTEWORTHY In people who are physically inactive and sitting for a majority of the day, a 1-h bout of vigorous exercise failed to improve lipid, glucose, and insulin metabolism measured the next day. It seems that something inherent to inactivity and/or prolonged sitting makes the body resistant to the 1 h of exercise preventing the normally derived metabolic improvements following exercise.",Increased central cholinergic drive contributes to the apneas of serotonin-deficient rat pups during active sleep.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30763168,"Journal of applied physiology (Bethesda, Md. : 1985)",2019 05 03,"Infant rat pups lacking central nervous system (CNS) serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) have unstable breathing during prolonged periods of active sleep. Given that cholinergic neurons are drivers of active sleep and project to respiratory patterning regions in the brainstem, we hypothesized that 5-HT preserves respiratory stability in active sleep by dampening central cholinergic drive. We used whole-body plethysmography coupled with nuchal electromyography to monitor the breathing pattern of 2-wk-old tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (TPH2)+/+ and TPH2-deficient (TPH2-/-) pups in active sleep, before and after muscarinic blockade. For the group 1 experiment we injected methylatropine (Ap-M), a CNS-impermeant form of atropine, followed ~30 min later by an injection of atropine sulfate (Ap-S), the CNS-permeant form (both 1 mg/kg, 10 μl bolus iv); both injections occurred within an active sleep episode. We analyzed the effect of each drug on the coefficient of variation of the respiratory period (CV-P) during active sleep. For the group 2 experiment rats were cycled through several episodes of active and quiet sleep before administration of Ap-S (1 mg/kg, 200 μl ip) or vehicle. We assessed the effect of Ap-S on the apnea indices of both genotypes during quiet and active sleep. In group 1 Ap-S significantly reduced the CV-P of TPH2-/- pups (P = 0.03), an effect not observed in TPH2+/+ pups or following Ap-M. In group 2 the apnea index of TPH2-/- pups was significantly reduced following Ap-S injection (P = 0.04), whereas the apnea index of TPH2+/+ littermates was unaffected (P = 0.58). These findings suggest that central 5-HT reduces apnea and stabilizes breathing by reducing cholinergic signaling through muscarinic receptors. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Serotonin in the central nervous system (CNS) is necessary for maintaining the stability of breathing in the early postnatal period, particularly during active sleep. Here we show that the administration of atropine to the CNS selectively stabilizes the respiratory pattern of tryptophan hydroxylase 2-deficient rat pups and reduces their apneas. This suggests that CNS serotonin stabilizes breathing at least in part by reducing central cholinergic drive.",Disuse-induced insulin resistance susceptibility coincides with a dysregulated skeletal muscle metabolic transcriptome.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30763167,"Journal of applied physiology (Bethesda, Md. : 1985)",2019 05 16,"Short-term muscle disuse is characterized by skeletal muscle insulin resistance, although this response is divergent across subjects. The mechanisms regulating inactivity-induced insulin resistance between populations that are more or less susceptible to disuse-induced insulin resistance are not known. RNA sequencing was conducted on vastus lateralis muscle biopsies from subjects before and after bed rest (n = 26) to describe the transcriptome of inactivity-induced insulin resistance. Subjects were separated into Low (n = 14) or High (n = 12) Susceptibility Groups based on the magnitude of change in insulin sensitivity after 5 days of bed rest. Both groups became insulin-resistant after bed rest, and there were no differences between groups in nonmetabolic characteristics (body mass, body mass index, fat mass, and lean mass). The High Susceptibility Group had more genes altered >1.5-fold (426 high versus 391 low) and more than twofold (73 high versus 55 low). Twenty-four genes were altered more than twofold in the High Susceptibility Group that did not change in the Low Susceptibility Group. 95 gene changes correlated with the changes in insulin sensitivity; 6 of these genes changed more than twofold in the High Susceptibility Group. Participants in the High Susceptibility Group were uniquely characterized with muscle gene responses described by a decrease in pathways responsible for lipid uptake and oxidation, decreased capacity for triglyceride export (APOB), increased lipogenesis (i.e., PFKFB3, FASN), and increased amino acid export (SLC43A1). These transcriptomic data provide a comprehensive examination of pathways and genes that may be useful biomarkers, or novel targets to offset muscle disuse-induced insulin resistance. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Short-term muscle disuse results in skeletal muscle insulin resistance through mechanisms that are not fully understood. Following a 5-day bed rest intervention, subjects were divided into High and Low Susceptibility Groups to inactivity-induced insulin resistance. This was followed by a genome-wide transcriptional analysis on muscle biopsy samples to gain insight on divergent insulin sensitivity responses. Our primary finding was that the skeletal muscle of subjects who experienced the most inactivity-induced insulin resistance (high susceptibility) was characterized by a decreased preference for lipid oxidation, increased lipogenesis, and increased amino acid export.",Chondroitin sulfate attenuates acid-induced augmentation of the mechanical response in rat thin-fiber muscle afferents in vitro.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30763166,"Journal of applied physiology (Bethesda, Md. : 1985)",2019 04 18,"Exercise-induced tissue acidosis augments the exercise pressor reflex (EPR). One reason for this may be acid-induced mechanical sensitization in thin-fiber muscle afferents, which is presumably related to EPR. Acid-induced sensitization to mechanical stimulation has been reported to be attenuated in cultured primary-sensory neurons by exogenous chondroitin sulfate (CS) and chondroitinase ABC, suggesting that the extracellular matrix CS proteoglycan is involved in this sensitization. The purpose of this study was to clarify whether acid-induced sensitization of the mechanical response in the thin-fiber muscle afferents is also suppressed by exogenous CS and chondroitinase ABC using a single-fiber recording technique. A total of 88 thin fibers (conduction velocity <15.0 m/s) dissected from 86 male Sprague-Dawley rats were identified. A buffer solution at pH 6.2 lowered their mechanical threshold and increased their response magnitude. Five minutes after CS (0.3 and 0.03%) injection near the receptive field, these acid-induced changes were significantly reduced. No significant difference in attenuation was detected between the two CS concentrations. Chondroitinase ABC also significantly attenuated this sensitization. The control solution (0% CS) did not significantly alter the mechanical sensitization. Furthermore, no significant differences were detected in this sensitization and CS-based suppression between fibers with and without acid-sensitive channels [transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1), acid-sensing ion channel (ASIC)]. In addition, this mechanical sensitization was not changed by TRPV1 and ASIC antagonists, suggesting that these ion channels are not involved in the acid-induced mechanical sensitization of muscle thin-fiber afferents. In conclusion, CS administration has a potential to attenuate the acidosis-induced exaggeration of muscle mechanoreflex. NEW & NOTEWORTHY We found that exogenous chondroitin sulfate attenuated acid-induced mechanical sensitization in thin-fiber muscle afferents that play a crucial role in the exercise pressor reflex. This finding suggests that extracellular matrix chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans may be involved in the mechanism of acid-induced mechanical sensitization and that daily intake of chondroitin sulfate may potentially attenuate this amplification of muscle mechanoreflex and therefore reduce muscle pain related to acidic muscle conditions.",Tidal breathing flow volume profiles during sleep in wheezing infants measured by impedance pneumography.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30763165,"Journal of applied physiology (Bethesda, Md. : 1985)",2019 05 16,"Overnight analysis of tidal breathing flow volume (TBFV) loops, recorded by impedance pneumography (IP), has been successfully applied in the home monitoring of children with wheezing disorders. However, little is known on how sleep physiology modifies the relationship between TBFV profiles and wheeze. We studied such interactions in wheezing infants. Forty-three infants recruited because of recurrent lower airway symptoms were divided into three groups based on their risk of asthma: high (HR), intermediate (IR), or low (LR). Sedated patients underwent infant lung function testing including assessment of airway responsiveness to methacholine at the hospital and a full-night recording of TBFV profiles at home with IP during natural sleep. Overnight TBFV indexes were estimated from periods of higher and lower respiration variability, presumably belonging to active [rapid eye movement (REM)] and quiet [non-REM (NREM)] sleep, respectively. From 35 valid recordings, absolute time indexes showed intrasubject sleep phase differences. Peak flow relative to time and volume was lower in HR compared with LR only during REM, suggesting altered expiratory control. Indexes estimating the concavity/convexity of flow decrease during exhalation suggested limited flow during passive exhale in HR compared with IR and LR, similarly during NREM and REM. Moreover, during REM convexity was negatively correlated with maximal flow at functional residual capacity and methacholine responsiveness. We conclude that TBFV profiles determined from overnight IP recordings vary because of sleep phase and asthma risk. Physiological changes during REM, most likely decrease in respiratory muscle tone, accentuate the changes in TBFV profiles caused by airway obstruction. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Impedance pneumography was used to investigate overnight tidal breathing flow volume (TBFV) indexes and their interactions with sleep phase [rapid eye movement (REM) vs. non-REM] at home in wheezing infants. The study shows that TBFV indexes vary significantly because of sleep phase and asthma risk of the infant and that during REM the changes in TBFV indexes caused by airway obstruction are accentuated and better associated with lung function of the infant.",Respiratory system reactance reflects communicating lung volume in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30763164,"Journal of applied physiology (Bethesda, Md. : 1985)",2019 05 09,"Respiratory system reactance (Xrs) measured by the forced oscillation technique (FOT) is theoretically and experimentally related to lung volume. In chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the absolute volume measured by body plethysmography includes a proportion that is inaccessible to pressure oscillations applied via the mouth, that is, a ""noncommunicating"" lung volume. We hypothesized that in COPD the presence of noncommunicating lung would disrupt the expected Xrs-volume relationship compared with plethysmographic functional residual capacity (FRCpleth). Instead, Xrs would relate to estimates of communicating volume, namely, expiratory reserve volume (ERV) and single-breath alveolar volume (VaSB). We examined FOT and lung function data from people with COPD (n = 51) and from healthy volunteers (n = 40). In healthy volunteers, we observed an expected inverse relationship between reactance at 5 Hz (X5) and FRCpleth. In contrast, there was no such relationship between X5 and FRCpleth in COPD subjects. However, there was an inverse relationship between X5 and both ERV and VaSB. Hence the theoretical Xrs-volume relationship is present in COPD but only when considering the communicating volume rather than the absolute lung volume. These findings confirm the role of reduced communicating lung volume as an important determinant of Xrs and therefore advance our understanding and interpretation of FOT measurements in COPD. NEW & NOTEWORTHY To investigate the determinants of respiratory system reactance (Xrs) measured by the forced oscillation technique (FOT) in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), we examine the relationship between Xrs and lung volume. We show that Xrs does not relate to absolute lung volume (functional residual capacity) in COPD but instead relates only to the volume of lung in communication with the airway opening. This communicating volume may therefore be fundamental to our interpretation of FOT measurements in COPD and other pulmonary diseases.",Inspiratory muscle activation via ventral lower thoracic high-frequency spinal cord stimulation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30763163,"Journal of applied physiology (Bethesda, Md. : 1985)",2019 04 15,"In animals, high-frequency spinal cord stimulation (HF-SCS) applied on the ventral epidural surface at the T2 level results in negative airway pressure generation consistent with inspiratory muscle activation. In the present study, in anesthetized dogs, we found that ventral HF-SCS (500 Hz) applied at all thoracic levels resulted in negative airway pressure generation. In the region of the lower thoracic spinal cord, negative airway pressure generation was most pronounced at the T9 level. At this level, airway pressure generation was monitored: 1) during ventral HF-SCS over a wide range of stimulus amplitudes (0.5-15 mA) and frequencies (50-1,000 Hz) and 2) following spinal sections at C8 (to assess potential diaphragm activation) and subsequently at T6 (to assess potential intercostal muscle activation). The application of low stimulus currents between 1 and 2 mA and high stimulus frequencies (>300 Hz) resulted in the development of large negative airway pressure generation. Stimulation with 1 mA, 500 Hz resulted in a highest negative airway pressure generation of 47 ± 2 cmH2O. Increasing stimulus current was associated with progressive reductions in the magnitude of negative airway pressure generation. HF-SCS (500 Hz) with 15 mA resulted in a negative airway pressure generation of 7 ± 3 cmH2O. C8 section markedly reduced negative airway pressure generation, and subsequent T6 section resulted in positive airway pressure generation after HF-SCS. Our results indicate the existence of pathways with connections to both the phrenic and inspiratory intercostal motoneuron pools in the ventral part of the lower thoracic spinal cord. We speculate that the circuits mediating the previously described excitatory intercostal-to-phrenic reflex mediate the observed responses. NEW & NOTEWORTHY This study suggests that, in contrast to dorsal high-frequency spinal cord stimulation at the T9 spinal level, which results in positive pressure generation, ventral high-frequency spinal cord stimulation at the same spinal level results in large negative airway pressure generation with low stimulus currents. This method, therefore, may provide an alternative method to restore ventilation in ventilator-dependent spinal cord-injured patients."

Thirty subjects were recruited who performed cardiopulmonary exercise tests to exhaustion 2 weeks before (pre), 1 week after (post) and 5 weeks after (follow-up) an 8-day non-competitive amateur cycling event (TFL). The exercise volume during the TFL was 7.7 fold the volume during the preparation period. Heart rate and cardiopulmonary parameters were obtained at standardised absolute submaximal workloads (low, medium and high intensity) and at peak level each test. Subjects were classified as functionally overreached (FOR) or acute fatigued (AF) based on the change in performance. No differences between FOR and AF were observed for heart rate (P = .51). On total group level (AF + FOR), post-TFL heart rate decreased significantly at low (-4.4 beats·min-1, 95% CI [-8.7, -0.1]) and medium (-5.5 beats·min-1 [-8.5, -2.4]), but not at high intensity. Peak heart rate decreased -3.4 beats·min-1 [-6.1, -0.7]. O2pulse was on average 0.49 ml O2·beat-1 [0.09, 0.89] higher at all intensities after intensified training. No changes in ⩒O2 (P = .44) or the ventilatory threshold (P = .21) were observed.

Part A, Chemistry, analysis, control, exposure & risk assessment",2019 04 15,"Calcium carbonate (E170) is a common food and pharmaceutical additive/ingredient. In addition to a source of calcium, the carbonate has uses including as a colour, acidity regulator and bulking agent. Globally, a range of regulatory agencies and pharmacopoeia control the analyses and specification of additives in food, supplements, pharmaceutical substances and excipients. Accordingly, a range of specifications and analyses exist for calcium carbonate depending on the application and market of the product. In this contribution, we analyse calcium carbonates from geological, synthetic and biogenic sources, focussing on acid insoluble impurities, a test required by current monographs. Analysis of calcium carbonate from different origins may require modification of existing tests to comply with regulatory bodies, due to the variation of impurities specific to the source of the material. We suggest an analytical approach involving centrifugation that improves analytical efficiency (up to 85% time reduction), especially for calcium carbonate of biological origin.",Are hybrid sit-stand postures a good compromise between sitting and standing?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30763145,Ergonomics,2019 05 28,"Potential alternatives for conventional sitting and standing postures are hybrid sit-stand postures (i.e. perching). The purposes of this study were (i) to identify where lumbopelvic and pelvic angles deviate from sitting and standing and (ii) to use these breakpoints to define three distinct postural phases: sitting, perching, and standing, in order to examine differences in muscle activations and ground reaction forces between phases. Twenty-four participants completed 19 1-min static trials, from sitting (90°) to standing (180°), sequentially in 5°trunk-thigh angle increments. The perching phase was determined to be 145-175° for males and 160-175° for females. For both sexes, knee extensor activity was lower in standing compared to perching or sitting (p < .01). Anterior-posterior forces were the highest in perching (p < .001), requiring ∼15% of body-weight. Chair designs aimed at reducing the lower limb demands within 115-170° trunk-thigh angle may improve the feasibility of sustaining the perched posture. Practitioner summary: Individuals who develop low back pain in sitting or standing may benefit from hybrid sit-stand postures (perching), yet kinematic and kinetic changes associated with these postures have not been investigated. Perching can improve lumbar posture at a cost of increased lower limb demands, suggesting potential avenues for chair design improvement.

This new era was distinct from the preceding era of vaccination for 4 main reasons. First, federal leadership in support of immunization at the local level grew. Second, immunization proponents championed the required vaccination of children as the best means of ensuring a protected population. Third, immunization proponents championed the idea that mass vaccination would not only help manage infectious diseases but also eradicate them. Fourth, the focus of local and federally supported immunization initiatives began to extend to the ""mild"" and ""moderate"" diseases of childhood (eg, measles), so-called because they were seen as less severe than previous targets of mass vaccination, such as smallpox, polio, and diphtheria. This article follows the history of measles to explore immunization successes and challenges in this modern era, because measles was the first of the mild and moderate diseases to become the target of a federally supported eradication-through-vaccination campaign, one that relied heavily on the preemptive, required vaccination of children. Its story thus epitomizes the range of political, epidemiological, cultural, and communications challenges to mass immunization in the modern era of vaccination.",Variant PADI3 in Central Centrifugal Cicatricial Alopecia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30763140,The New England journal of medicine,2019 03 07,"Central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia (CCCA) is the most common form of scarring alopecia among women of African ancestry.

High-quality health care requires nurses to have the skills, knowledge and attitudes to provide care for people experiencing mental illness or mental distress. Research suggests health professionals, including nurses, tend to share similar negative attitudes to mental illness as the general population, and consequently, mental health nursing is not a popular career path. These two factors signify a need to influence more positive attitudes toward mental illness and mental health nursing among nursing students. A qualitative exploratory research study was undertaken to examine the experiences, opinions and attitudes of an academic and research team to the introduction of a consumer academic within an undergraduate mental health nursing subject. In-depth interviews were conducted with teaching and research team members. The importance of mental health skills emerged as a major theme and included sub-themes: mental health across the health care system; contribution of consumer academic to nursing skills; addressing fear and stigma, and inspiring passion in mental health nursing. Findings suggest academic input from people with lived experience of recovery from mental illness can influence the development of mental health nursing skills and enhance the popularity of mental health nursing as a career.",Silica-Based Infiltrations for Enhanced Zirconia-Resin Interface Toughness.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30763138,Journal of dental research,2019 06 11,"Novel silica-based infiltrations on the surface of zirconia have the potential to improve their bondability, allowing for the etching/silane adhesive bonding technique. Nonetheless, adhesively bonded joints are subject to mixed tensile and shear stresses when the restoration is in occlusal service. Thus, we aimed to investigate the effect of 2 novel silica-based infiltrations on the interfacial toughness of adhesively bonded zirconia using the Brazil nut method, which allows for controlled types of stresses to be applied at the interfaces. In total, 150 3Y-TZP (In-Ceram YZ; Vita) Brazil nuts were machined and randomly assigned to 3 groups: C, control (air abraded); SG, sol-gel silica infiltration; and GI, glass infiltration. SG specimens were immersed twice in silicic acid for 20 min and dried (100°C, 1 h). GI specimens were presintered (1,400°C, 1 h) before a glass powder slurry was applied to the intaglio surface. All specimens were then sintered (1,530°C, 2 h). Following adhesive bonding (Panavia F 2.0, Kuraray) and water storage (37°C) for 10 d, the Brazil nuts were subdivided into groups baseline and aged (40,000 thermal cycles between 5°C and 55°C, with a dwell time of 30 s). The Brazil nuts were subjected to axial-loading tests using various inclinations (precrack angle with load direction): Θ = 0°, 5°, 10°, 15°, or 25°, which define the stress type at the interface, from pure tension (0°) to increasing levels of shear. Under pure tension (0°), GI yielded superior interfacial fracture energy, SG and C were similar, and aging had no effect. Under predominantly shear stresses (25°), aging significantly decreased interfacial fracture energy of C and SG, while GI remained stable and was superior. The glass infiltration of the zirconia intaglio surface increases its adhesive bonding interfacial toughness. The sol-gel silica infiltration method requires improvement to obtain a homogeneous surface infiltration and an enhanced bond strength."

In this study, the osteogenic effect of SMF on hBMSCs in a 3DP scaffold was investigated in vitro and in vivo. In addition, the potential mechanism for promoting osteogenesis was investigated by proteomic analysis. The results showed that SMF promoted osteogenic differentiation of hBMSCs in vitro. A total of 185 differential proteins were identified under SMF conditions by proteomic analysis. The osteogenic effect might be associated with bone morphogenetic protein-Smad1/5/8-signaling pathway and increased transport of phosphorylated Smad1/5/8 and phosphorylated Smad2/3 to the nucleus by up-regulating Smad4 under SMF conditions. The in vivo experiment showed that bone regeneration and osseointegration was enhanced by SMF in the rat model of bone defect.

In the present study, we analyzed the insulin signaling pathway and regulation of mitochondrial substrate oxidation in three regions of ground squirrel brain (forebrain, cerebellum, and brainstem), comparing summer, late torpor, and interbout arousal conditions. We found select decreases in phospho-Akt in the cerebellum during torpor as compared to summer animals, as well as select increases in the forebrain during interbout arousal, suggesting that Akt may influence either metabolism or cytoprotective pathways. The phosphoprotein abundance of GSK3β showed the most consistent trend across all three brain regions with peak increases observed during deep torpor, suggesting a crucial role for this protein during hibernation. Furthermore, all three regions of the brain showed increased phospho-protein abundance of pyruvate dehydrogenase at serine 232 during both deep torpor and interbout arousal and serine 300 during interbout arousal only, whereas phosphorylation sites showed a region-specific expression pattern.

Existing therapies including those based on minor groove binders (MGBs), such as the diamidines, which have been used for decades, have now lost efficacy in some places because of the emergence of resistant parasites. Consequently, the need for new chemotherapies is urgent.

This combination of excited state photochemistry and thermal electrocyclic cascade reactions allows simple planar molecules to be rapidly transformed into sp3-rich scaffolds.","Multiconfiguration Pair-Density Functional Theory for Iron Porphyrin with CAS, RAS, and DMRG Active Spaces.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30763100,The journal of physical chemistry. A,2019 04 24,"Porphyrins are present in many metalloproteins, and they are also important components of a variety of nonbiological functional materials. Furthermore, they are representative of the kind of large, strongly correlated system that is especially difficult for accurate calculations. For example, predicting the order of their spin states has been challenging. Here we study the energetic order of four states (one singlet, two triplets, and one quintet) of iron porphyrin, FeP, by the multiconfiguration pair-density functional theory (MC-PDFT). Five active space prescriptions, namely, CAS(8, 6), CAS(8, 11), CAS(16, 15), RAS(34,2,2;13,6,16), and DMRG(34, 35), are used to obtain the kinetic energy, density, and on-top density. Although the prediction of which spin state of FeP is the ground state depends on the selection of the active space when one uses multireference second-order perturbation theory and such calculations lead incorrectly to a quintet ground state with the largest studied active space, all five active spaces correctly lead to a triplet ground state when one uses MC-PDFT. We conclude that the (34,35) active space is large enough to give a qualitatively correct description of the orbital space and configuration space such that one obtains the correct spin state prediction when the external correlation energy is added accurately in a post-SCF step. We also conclude that MC-PDFT can provide an efficient and accurate approach to treat the electron correlation in large, strongly correlated systems with the complexity of iron porphyrin.",Aerobic Oxidative Alkenylation of Weak O-Coordinating Arylacetamides with Alkenes via a Rh(III)-Catalyzed C-H Activation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30763099,Organic letters,2019 06 03,"A versatile and site-selective rhodium(III)-catalyzed aerobic oxidative alkenylation of arylacetamides including primary, secondary, and tertiary amides having a weak O-coordinating acetamide directing group with alkenes is described.

Development of novel strategies to tackle antibiotic resistance is of the utmost priority. In this study, we combined glutathione (GSH), a master antioxidant in all mammalian cells, and nitric oxide, a proven biofilm-dispersing agent, to produce GSNO. The resazurin biofilm viability assay, crystal violet biofilm assay, and confocal microscopy techniques showed that GSNO disrupted biofilms of both P. aeruginosa PAO1 and multidrug resistant A. baumaunii (MRAB 015069) more efficiently than GSH alone. In addition, GSNO showed a higher reduction in biofilm viability and biomass when combined with antibiotics. This combination treatment also inhibited A. baumaunii (MRAB 015069) growth and facilitated human foreskin fibroblast (HFF-1) confluence and growth simultaneously. A potentially inhalable GSNO powder with reasonable aerosol performance and antibiofilm activity was produced by spray drying. This combination shows promise as a novel formulation for treating pulmonary bacterial infections.",Hemisquaramide Tweezers as Organocatalysts: Synthesis of Cyclic Carbonates from Epoxides and CO2.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30763097,Organic letters,2019 06 04,"Hemisquaramide tweezers, a new family of H-bond donor organocatalysts, are reported. The catalysts could be synthesized within two steps. Among them, H8-binaphthyl-linked hemisquaramide 7 markedly accelerated the synthesis of cyclic carbonates from epoxides and CO2. The reactions proceeded well under mild and solvent-free conditions. Kinetic resolution was also achieved at -20 °C ( s = 3.0). The adjustable bite angle and orientation of the two NH groups of the catalysts are important for the high activity.",The Diverse Nature of Ion Speciation at the Nanoscale Hydrophobic/Water Interface.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30763096,The journal of physical chemistry. B,2019 03 14,"Many biological systems are composed of nanoscale structures having hydrophobic and hydrophilic groups adjacent to one another and in contact with aqueous electrolyte solution. The interaction of ions with such structures is of fundamental importance. Although many studies have focused on characterizing planar extended (often air/water) interfaces, little is known about ion speciation at complex nanoscale biological systems. To start understanding the complex mechanisms involved, we use a hexadecane nanodroplet system, stabilized with a dilute monolayer of positively charged dodecyltrimethylammonium cations (DTA+) groups in contact with an electrolyte solution (NaSCN). Using vibrational sum frequency scattering, second harmonic scattering, ζ-potential measurements, and quantum density functional theory, we find DTA+-SCN- ion pairing at concentrations as low as 5 mM. A variety of ion species emerge at different ionic strengths, with differently oriented SCN- groups adsorbed on hydrophilic or hydrophobic parts of the surface. This diverse and heterogeneous chemical environment is surprisingly different from the behavior at extended liquid planar interfaces, where ion pairing is typically detected at molar concentrations and nanoscale system stability is no requirement.",Thermally Stable Copper(II)-Doped Cesium Lead Halide Perovskite Quantum Dots with Strong Blue Emission.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30763095,The journal of physical chemistry letters,2019 03 13,"All-inorganic perovskite quantum dots (QDs) have emerged as potentially promising materials for lighting and displays, but their poor thermal stability restricts their practical application. In addition, optical characteristics of the blue-emitting CsPbX3 QDs lag behind their red- and green-emitting counterparts. Herein, we addressed these two issues by doping divalent Cu2+ ions into the perovskite lattice to form CsPb1- xCu xX3 QDs. Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) measurements reveal that doping smaller Cu2+ guest ions induces a lattice contraction and eliminates halide vacancies, which leads to an increased lattice formation energy and improved short-range order of the doped perovskite QDs. This results in the improvement of both the thermal stability and the optical performance of CsPb1- xCu x(Br/Cl)3 QDs, which exhibit bright blue photoluminescence at 450-460 nm, with a high quantum yield of over 80%. The CsPb1- xCu xX3 QD films maintain stable luminescence performance even when annealed at temperatures of over 250 °C.",Accelerated Aging of PS Blocks in PS- b-PMMA Diblock Copolymer under Hard Confinement.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30763094,The journal of physical chemistry.

The three-dimensional hard nanoconfinement was provided by the PMMA component owing to its high elasticity and was formed via self-assembled microphase separation. Aging was observed by measuring enthalpy recovery of the PS blocks in the copolymers for which the degree of polymerization ( N) of PS blocks is fixed, whereas the N of PMMA blocks varies. Our results demonstrate that the aging speed of the PS blocks can increase by a factor of three to that of the neat PS as the N of PMMA blocks increases. Therefore, the hard confinement accelerates physical aging of the PS blocks, i.e., the relatively soft component in the copolymer.",Relative Principal Components Analysis: Application to Analyzing Biomolecular Conformational Changes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30763093,Journal of chemical theory and computation,2019 04 16,"A new method termed ""Relative Principal Components Analysis"" (RPCA) is introduced that extracts optimal relevant principal components to describe the change between two data samples representing two macroscopic states. The method is widely applicable in data-driven science. Calculating the components is based on a physical framework that introduces the objective function (the Kullback-Leibler divergence) appropriate for quantifying the change of the macroscopic state affected by the changes in the microscopic features. To demonstrate the applicability of RPCA, we analyze the thermodynamically relevant conformational changes of the protein HIV-1 protease upon binding to different drug molecules. In this case, the RPCA method provides a sound thermodynamic foundation for analyzing the binding process and thus characterizing both the collective and the locally relevant conformational changes. Moreover, the relevant collective conformational changes can be reconstructed from the informative latent variables to exhibit both the enhanced and the restricted conformational fluctuations upon ligand association."

Here we report a new route to NO from the biosynthetic pathway to the N-nitroso compound streptozocin. We show that the N-nitroso group of streptozocin comes from the biosynthetic reassembly of l-arginine, with the guanidino nitrogens forming a nitrogen-nitrogen bond. To understand this biosynthetic process, we identify the biosynthetic gene cluster of streptozocin and demonstrate that free l-arginine is N-methylated by StzE to give Nω-monomethyl-l-arginine. We show that this product is then oxidized by StzF, a nonheme iron-dependent enzyme unrelated to known nitric oxide synthases, generating a urea compound and NO. Our work implies that formation and capture of NO is the likely route to N-nitroso formation in vivo. Altogether, our work unveils a new enzyme pair for the production of NO from l-arginine and sets the stage for understanding biosynthetic routes to N-nitroso natural products.",Predictive Strength of Photophysical Measurements for in Vitro Photobiological Activity in a Series of Ru(II) Polypyridyl Complexes Derived from π-Extended Ligands.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30763081,Inorganic chemistry,2019 05 07,"This study investigates the correlation between photocytotoxicity and the prolonged excited-state lifetimes exhibited by certain Ru(II) polypyridyl photosensitizers comprised of π-expansive ligands.

Human melanoma SKMEL28 and human leukemia HL60 cells were used as in vitro models to test photocytotoxicity induced by the compounds when activated by either broadband visible or monochromatic red light. The photocytotoxicities of the metal complexes investigated varied over 2 orders of magnitude and were positively correlated with their excited-state lifetimes. The complexes with the longest excited-state lifetimes, contributed by low-lying 3IL states, were the most phototoxic toward cancer cells under all conditions.",Ranking Reversible Covalent Drugs: From Free Energy Perturbation to Fragment Docking.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30763080,Journal of chemical information and modeling,2019 06 10,"Reversible covalent inhibitors have drawn increasing attention in drug design, as they are likely more potent than noncovalent inhibitors and less toxic than covalent inhibitors. Despite those advantages, the computational prediction of reversible covalent binding presents a formidable challenge because the binding process consists of multiple steps and quantum mechanics (QM) level calculation is needed to estimate the covalent binding free energy. It has been shown that the dissociation rates and the equilibrium dissociation constants vary significantly even with similar warheads, due to noncovalent interactions. We have previously used a simplistic two-state model for predicting the relative binding selectivity of reversible covalent inhibitors ( J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2017, 139 , 17945 ). Here we go beyond binding selectivity and demonstrate that it is possible to use free energy perturbation (FEP) molecular dynamics (MD) to calculate the overall reversible covalent binding using a specially designed thermodynamic cycle. We show that FEP can predict the varying binding free energies of the analogs sharing a common warhead. More importantly, our results revealed that the chemical modification away from warhead alters the binding affinity at both noncovalent and covalent binding states, and the computational prediction can be improved by considering the binding free energy of both states. Furthermore, we explored the possibility of using a more rapid computational method, site-identification by ligand competitive saturation (SILCS), to rank the same set of reversible covalent inhibitors. We found that the fragment docking to a set of precomputed fragment maps produces a reasonable ranking. In conclusion, two independent approaches provided consistent results that the covalent binding state is suitable for the initial ranking of the reversible covalent drug candidates. For lead-optimization, the FEP approach designed here can provide more rigorous and detailed information regarding how much the covalent and noncovalent binding states are contributing to the overall binding affinity, thus offering a new avenue for fine-tuning the noncovalent interactions for optimizing reversible covalent drugs.",Zeolitic Intermetallics: LnNiSi (Ln = La-Nd).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30763079,Journal of the American Chemical Society,2019 02 27,"LnNiSi (Ln = La-Nd) comprising a three-dimensional NiSi framework has electrons in the crystallographic cavity space. In the temperature region 473-773 K, it accepts the insertion/de-insertion of hydrogen topotactically without a change in unitcell volume. The insertion of hydrogens into the cavity space is accompanied by a redox reaction with the orbitals of atoms constituting the cavity wall. Having small work functions, such intermetallic electrides exhibit metallic electrical and magnetic properties. Owing to a high electron-donating power and reversible exchange between hydrogen and the electrons, Ru5wt%-loaded LaNiSi powder worked as an efficient catalyst for ammonia synthesis under ambient pressure.",Cocatalysts for Selective Photoreduction of CO2 into Solar Fuels.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30763077,Chemical reviews,2019 03 27,"Photoreduction of CO2 into sustainable and green solar fuels is generally believed to be an appealing solution to simultaneously overcome both environmental problems and energy crisis. The low selectivity of challenging multi-electron CO2 photoreduction reactions makes it one of the holy grails in heterogeneous photocatalysis. This Review highlights the important roles of cocatalysts in selective photocatalytic CO2 reduction into solar fuels using semiconductor catalysts. A special emphasis in this review is placed on the key role, design considerations and modification strategies of cocatalysts for CO2 photoreduction. Various cocatalysts, such as the biomimetic, metal-based, metal-free, and multifunctional ones, and their selectivity for CO2 photoreduction are summarized and discussed, along with the recent advances in this area.

Here, using a pH-sensitive benzoic-imine bond and inverse electron-demand Diels-Alder cycloaddition, we prepared magnetic nanoclusters (NCs) armed with responsive PD-1 antibody (aP), which could then bind onto effector T cells due to their PD-1 expression. After adoptive transfer, the magnetization and superparamagnetism of NCs enabled us to magnetically recruit effector T cells and aP simultaneously to tumor sites with MRI guidance. Owing to the acidic intratumoral microenvironment, the benzoic-imine bond then hydrolyzed, leading to the release of aP. The therapeutic effects of adoptive T cells and free aP could thus be spatiotemporally coupled. As a result, we achieved inhibition of tumor growth with few side effects, demonstrating the great promise of such a chemical approach for safe and high-performance adoptive T-cell therapy against solid tumors.",Particle-Attachment-Mediated and Matrix/Lattice-Guided Enamel Apatite Crystal Growth.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30763075,ACS nano,2019 03 29,"Tooth enamel is a hard yet resilient biomaterial that derives its unique mechanical properties from decussating bundles of apatite crystals. To understand enamel crystal nucleation and growth at a nanoscale level and to minimize preparation artifacts, the developing mouse enamel matrix was imaged in situ using graphene liquid cells and atomic resolution scanning transmission electron and cryo-fracture electron microscopy. We report that 1-2 nm diameter mineral precipitates aggregated to form larger 5 nm particle assemblies within ameloblast secretory vesicles or annular organic matrix subunits. Further evidence for the fusion of 1-2 nm mineral precipitates into 5 nm mineral aggregates via particle attachment was provided by matrix-mediated calcium phosphate crystal growth studies. As a next step, aggregated particles organized into rows of 3-10 subunits and developed lattice suprastructures with 0.34 nm gridline spacings corresponding to the (002) planes of apatite crystals. Mineral lattice suprastructures superseded closely matched organic matrix patterns, suggestive of a combination of organic/inorganic templates guiding apatite crystal growth. Upon assembly of 2-5 nm subunits into crystal ribbons, lattice fringes indicative of the presence of larger ordered crystallites were observed surrounding elongating crystal ribbons, presumably guiding the c-axis growth of composite apatite crystals. Cryo-fracture micrographs revealed reticular networks of an organic matrix on the surface of elongating enamel crystal ribbons, suggesting that protein coats facilitate c-axis apatite crystal growth. Together, these data demonstrate (i) the involvement of particle attachment in enamel crystal nucleation, (ii) a combination of matrix- and lattice-guided crystal growth, and (iii) fusion of individual crystals via a mechanism similar to Ostwald ripening.","Synthesis, Spectroscopy, and Redox Studies of Ferrocene-Functionalized Coinage Metal Alkyne Complexes.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30763074,Inorganic chemistry,2019 03 08,"Ethynylferrocene (FcC≡CH) was utilized as a redox-active metalloligand for the synthesis of polynuclear coinage metal complexes.

At the sulfur loading of 2.5 mg/cm2, initial specific capacity of 1021.8 mAh/g at 1C was achieved in the Li-S cell with the Ce-MOF-2/CNT coated separator, which was slowly reduced to 838.8 mAh/g after 800 cycles with a decay rate of only 0.022% and the Coulombic efficiency of nearly 100%. Even at a higher sulfur loading of 6 mg/cm2, the cell based on Ce-MOF-2/CNT separator coating still exhibited excellent performance with initial specific capacity of 993.5 mAh/g at 0.1 C. After 200 cycles, the specific capacity of 886.4 mAh/g was still retained. The excellent performance is ascribed to the efficient adsorption of the Ce-MOF-2 to Li2S6 species and its catalytic effect toward conversion of polysulfides, resulting in suppressed shuttle effect of polysulfides in the Li-S batteries.",Polymerization-Enhanced Two-Photon Photosensitization for Precise Photodynamic Therapy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30763072,ACS nano,2019 03 27,"Two-photon excited photodynamic therapy (2PE-PDT) has attracted great attention in recent years due to its great potential for deep-tissue and highly spatiotemporally precise cancer therapy.

Here, this work reports the synthesis of one-dimensional H0.92K0.08TiNbO5 nanowires via simple electrospinning followed by an ion-exchange reaction. The H0.92K0.08TiNbO5 nanowires consist of many small ""lumps"" with a uniform diameter distribution of around 150 nm. Used as an anode for lithium-ion batteries, H0.92K0.08TiNbO5 nanowires exhibit high capacity, fast electrochemical kinetics, and high performance of lithium-ion uptake. A capacity of 144.1 mA h g-1 can be carried by H0.92K0.08TiNbO5 nanowires at 0.5 C in the initial charge, and even after 150 cycles, the reversible capacity can remain at 123.7 mA h g-1 with an excellent capacity retention of 85.84%. For H0.92K0.08TiNbO5 nanowires, the diffusion coefficient of lithium ions is 1.97 × 10-11 cm2 s-1, which promotes the lithium-ion uptake effectively. The outstanding electrochemical performance is ascribed to its morphology and the formation of a stable phase during cycling. In addition, the in situ X-ray diffraction and ex situ transmission electron microscopy techniques are applied to reveal its lithium storage mechanism, which proves the structure stability and electrochemical reversibility, thus achieving high-performance lithium-ion uptake.

Current data suggest AMPK plays key roles in excitotoxicity and ischemic brain injury, with zinc neurotoxicity representing at least one mechanism of ischemic neuronal death. Inhibition of AMPK could be a viable therapeutic strategy to prevent ischemic brain injury following stroke. This prompted our search for novel inhibitors of AMPK activity and zinc-induced neuronal death using cultured mouse cortex and a rat model of brain injury after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). In structure-based virtual screening, 118 compounds were predicted to bind the active site of AMPK α2, and 40 showed in vitro AMPK α2 inhibitory activity comparable to compound C (a well-known, potent AMPK inhibitor). In mouse cortical neuronal cultures, 7 of 40 compound reduced zinc-induced neuronal death at levels comparable to compound C. Ultimately, only agents 2G11 and 1H10 significantly attenuated various types of neuronal death, including oxidative stress, excitotoxicity, and apoptosis. When administered as intracerebroventricular injections prior to permanent MCAO in rats, 2G11 and 1H10 reduced brain infarct volumes, whereas compound C did not. Therefore, these novel AMPK inhibitors could be drug development candidates to treat stroke.",Mass Spectrometry Uncovers the Role of Surfactin as an Interspecies Recruitment Factor.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30763059,ACS chemical biology,2019 03 15,"Microbes use metabolic exchange to sense and respond to their changing environment.

Using mass spectrometry, we reveal that Paenibacillus dendritiformis, originally isolated with B. subtilis, is not antagonized by the presence of surfactins and is actually attracted to them. We demonstrate here for the first time that P. dendritiformis is also actively degrading surfactins produced by B. subtilis and accumulating the degradation products that serve as territorial markers. This new attribute as an attractant of selected microbes and the conversion into a deterrent highlight the diverse role natural products have in shaping the environment and establishing mixed communities.",Acidic Site-Assisted Ammonia Sensing of Novel CuSbS2 Quantum Dots/Reduced Graphene Oxide Composites with an Ultralow Detection Limit at Room Temperature.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30763058,ACS applied materials & interfaces,2019 03 08,"Novel CuSbS2 quantum dots (QDs)/reduced graphene oxide (rGO) composites are self-assembled via a hot-injection method, and CuSbS2 QDs exhibit a near monodispersion on the rGO surface.

The study of the sensing mechanism reveals that the acidic sites on the surface play an extremely important role in NH3 adsorption of the composites, and the reaction between NH3 molecules and the pre-adsorbed oxygen ions finally leads to the generation of NO molecules.

Spinal manipulative therapy may provide short-term improvement in patients with acute or chronic low back pain, comparable with other standard treatments. When compared with oral analgesics, cervical manipulation and/or mobilization appears to provide better short-term pain relief and improved function in patients with neck pain. Manipulative therapies may be as effective as amitriptyline for treating migraine headaches and can reduce the frequency and intensity of pain. Although manipulative therapy is sometimes recommended to treat conditions in children (e.g., musculoskeletal problems, otitis media, respiratory conditions, infantile colic, allergies), there is supporting evidence only for reducing the length of hospital stay for preterm infants. Mild adverse events, such as muscle stiffness and soreness, occur in up to 50% of adults who undergo manipulative therapy. Although serious adverse events such as lumbar disk herniation, cauda equina syndrome, and vertebrobasilar injury are rare, they can cause significant disability or death.

Superficial infections occur in the skin and subcutaneous tissues, whereas deep infections can involve the tendon sheaths, adjacent anatomic compartments, deep fascial planes, bursae, joint spaces, and bones. Superficial hand infections are more common than deep infections and are typically managed with elevation, warm soaks, splinting in the position of function, analgesics, and empiric antibiotics when indicated. Paronychia, which can be acute or chronic, is an infection or inflammation of the nail fold. Treatment involves warm soaks, topical antibiotics, and abscess drainage, if indicated. A felon is an infection of the distal pulp of the finger. Treatment often involves surgical drainage and empiric oral antibiotics. Herpetic whitlow is caused by herpes simplex virus and typically resolves without intervention. Deep hand infections include pyogenic flexor tenosynovitis and clenched-fist bite wounds. Pyogenic flexor tenosynovitis is a rapidly progressing bacterial infection of the flexor tendon sheaths in the hand, most commonly caused by a penetrating injury to the finger. Clenched-fist bite wounds result from direct contact of the fist on incisor teeth and are associated with polymicrobial infections.

The TriFab format is a trivalent IgG-shaped entity composed of two Fab arms that bind to antigens on the surface of tumor cells, which are linked via flexible peptides to a CD3 binding moiety that replaces the CH2 domains of conventional IgGs. The distinctive feature of these T cell recruiting bispecifics is that their CD3 variable regions are incorporated between domains, rather than N- or C-terminally fused to an Fc or antibody fragments. T cell recruiting TriFabs resemble in size and shape, are expressed and show biophysical properties similar to regular IgGs. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) demonstrates high flexibility of the cell surface binding arms as well as target antigen accessibility of the interspersed CD3 binding domain.

Mostly these are cystadenolymphomas, but tumors of different histological types can be found as well. In these cases it is often pleomorphic adenoma in combination with cystadenolymphoma. Ultrasound is the first choice imaging modality. Case report: We present two patients with two simultaneous tumors in a unilateral parotid gland. In each case, B-mode ultrasound showed two hypoechoic masses, one of which was predominantly cystic. The subsequent use of Virtual Touch Imaging Quantification (VTIQ) showed tumors of elastic tissue. After a parotidectomy, both cases were diagnosed with pleomorphic adenoma combined with cystadenolymphoma. Conclusion: The combination of B-mode ultrasound and VTIQ is an important diagnostic modality and may improve diagnostic accuracy to differentiate between benign and malignant lesions. Every clinician should be aware of the co-existence of different histological types of tumors in unilateral salivary glands.",Portal vein tumor thrombus from gastric cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30763024,Journal of ultrasonography,2019 04 10,"A 53-year-old woman presented with left-sided abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting for the past 3 months with associated loss of appetite and weight. On physical examination, there was a large, ill-defined, firm mass at the epigastrium. Ultrasonography showed heterogeneously hypoechoic filling defect within the dilated main portal vein. The filling defect showed florid signals on Doppler mode and it appeared to be an extension of a larger periportal mass. Contrast enhanced abdominal computed tomography confirmed a large distal gastric mass infiltrating into the periportal structures, including the main portal vein and the splenic vein. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy performed 2 days later showed an irregular, exophytic mass extending from the antrum into the first part of duodenum. The mass was deemed inoperable.

We report and compare with published literature the clinical and sonographic findings in a case of iodide mumps that developed after the intravenous administration of iodine-based contrast media for a contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan. The exact pathogenesis is unknown to date: based on sonographic appearance, we support the hypothesis of an acute inflammatory condition elicited by iodine accumulation in the salivary glands. The emergency care practitioner needs to be confident with the clinical symptoms as well as the sonographic findings and therapeutic options to successfully manage this condition.",Heterotopic pregnancy - how easily you can go wrong in diagnosing? A case study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30763022,Journal of ultrasonography,2019 04 10,"Introduction: Heterotopic pregnancy is a rare, but potentially life-threatening pathology. The diagnosis of heterotopic pregnancy is still one of the biggest challenges in modern gynecology. The incidence of those pregnancies in natural conception is about 1:30000. Case presentation: We present an unusual case of a heterotopic pregnancy which was misdiagnosed in the first trimester as a dichorionic twin pregnancy. At 13 weeks of gestation, the patient presented with an acute abdomen, she was diagnosed with a heterotopic pregnancy, and therefore was operated on, with the excision of the ruptured fallopian tube and the ectopic pregnancy performed. Discussion: The presence of an intrauterine pregnancy does not rule out the presence of a coexisting ectopic pregnancy. Clinicians should always keep in mind that a heterotopic pregnancy may occur in a woman of reproductive age. Careful ultrasound scan of the uterus and appendages is a must in all women of reproductive age with clinical symptoms.",Recommendations for ultrasound examination in ophthalmology. Part II: Orbital ultrasound.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30763021,Journal of ultrasonography,2019 04 10,"Pathological processes within the orbits are a heterogeneous group of diseases of various etiologies, clinical pictures and therapy models. Due to poor access to the orbits in a clinical examination, imaging plays a significant role in both diagnosis and treatment monitoring in patients with an orbital pathology. One of such imaging modalities is ultrasonography. It is relatively well-available, rapid and safe for the patient. This paper enumerates indications for an orbital ultrasound scan, including functional ocular disorders (vision disorders, mobility disorders), autoimmune diseases, inflammatory conditions, proliferative processes, and others. The authors present Ossoinig's standardized method which encompasses topographic, qualitative and kinetic echography, and may facilitate orbital ultrasound examinations. Moreover, the article shows management standards for ultrasound imaging of orbital pathologies with an emphasis on the relevance of equipment selection, scanning technique (transducer position, transocular technique, paraocular technique) and patient preparation for the examination, and indicates appropriate elements of an examination report. The authors discuss the ultrasound presentation of the orbital structures in physiological conditions and selected orbital pathologies, such as pseudotumor, thyroid orbitopathy, cancerous tumors of the optic nerve, and others. The ultrasonographic characteristics of the presented pathologies are shown taking into account A and B scans. Attention was paid to the evaluation of angle kappa in the A scan in echographic assessment of the orbits. Furthermore, the authors include referential values for extraocular muscle thickness and quantitative measurement of the severity of thyroid ophthalmopathy based on Ossoinig's muscle index.",Recommendations for ultrasound examination in ophthalmology.

The highest frequencies are applied in medical imaging of an anterior segment of an eyeball. This paper covers the newest method of ultrasound imaging - an ultrabiomicroscopic examination. Its name reflects resolution which has so far been unavailable, and which allows for imaging a structure of the examined tissues. The article includes basic information about the structure and principles of operation of ultrabiomicroscopic examination tools. Moreover, its position among other methods for echographic examination of an eyeball was determined. Examination techniques and the role of standards of conduct at each stage of a diagnostic procedure were discussed. A role of insufficient cooperation between constructors of new ultrasonographic diagnostic tools and software IT specialist with the users of these tools, which results in the lack of consistency between the components of these sets was emphasized. Based on long term experience in ultrabiomicroscopic examinations, the authors shared observations on practical aspects of this method. Finally, indications and contraindications for ultrabiomicroscopic diagnostics were listed. Introduction of an ultrahigh frequency ultrasound probe allowed for the visualization of an post-iridial area of an anterior segment of an eyeball - an area whose diagnosis is impossible with other diagnostic methods. A wide spectrum of diagnostic indications, which covers both diseases and development anomalies of an anterior segment of an eyeball, confirms a special meaning of this method.",Recommendations for ultrasonographic assessment of renal arteries.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30763019,Journal of ultrasonography,2019 04 10,"The present clinical practice recommendations are addressed to physicians of all specialties, who perform Doppler ultrasound examinations of the kidneys on a daily basis, and in particular to specialists in radiology and imaging diagnostics.

The paper discusses patient preparation protocol, examinat ion technique with particular emphasis on patient's position allowing to obtain proper Doppler angle of insonation, as well as diagnostic limitations of the technique. Normal blood flow parameters as well as those indicating hemodynamically significant stenosis are also presented. Although the 2013-2014 American guidelines for renal artery duplex sonography (AIUM Practice Parameter for the Performance of Native Renal Artery Duplex Sonography and AIUM Practice Guideline for the Performance of an Ultrasound Examination of Solid-Organ Transplants), which were the basis for many national recommendations, have not been significantly updated to date, a large body of scientific research indicates the need for revision of current Doppler ultrasound standards and parameters, particularly for patients receiving endovascular treatment due to renovascular hypertension.

The PubMed database was also utilised to search the Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online, Excerpta Medica database, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health and Allied and Complimentary Medicine databases. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis methodology guidance was employed and a quality assessment was performed using the Jadad score. Results: Three randomised clinical trials met the inclusion criteria and were included for analysis. All three trials were of good quality based on the Jadad score. A total of 115 patients out of 254 received platelet-rich plasma injections under ultrasound guidance. The platelet-rich plasma recipient group included 61 males and 54 females with an age range from 53 to 71 years. Outcome scores show an improvement of symptoms and function maintained up to 12 months following platelet-rich plasma injection. Conclusions: Literature to date concludes that intra-articular platelet-rich plasma injections of the hip, performed under ultrasound guidance to treat hip osteoarthritis, are well tolerated and potentially efficacious in delivering long-term and clinically significant pain reduction and functional improvement in patients with hip osteoarthritis. Larger future trials including a placebo group are required to further evaluate these promising results.

We aim to derive a definitive estimate of the diagnostic accuracy of ultrasonography in clinically suspected scaphoid fractures. Methods: We undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis of included diagnostic cohort studies that discussed the use of ultrasonography in the diagnosis of occult scaphoid fractures. We searched the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence database using the Healthcare Databases Advanced Search tool. In addition, we utilized the PubMed database to search the Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online, Excerpta Medica database, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health and Allied and Complimentary Medicine databases. Studies were included if they discuss the role of ultrasound imaging in the diagnosis of scaphoid fractures based on cortical interruption, radio-carpal effusion and scapho-trapezium-trapezoid effusion. Quality assessment was performed using the methodological index for non-randomized studies scoring system. Results: 6 non-randomized control studies met the inclusion criteria. Collectively, these included 236 patients with a mean age ranging from 18 to 41.2 years. The quality of these articles ranged between moderate and high based on the methodological index for non-randomized studies score. The mean sensitivity was 88.95% (standard deviation 10.03) and mean specificity was 89.50% (standard deviation 12.21). Conclusion: The current literature reveals high sensitivity and specificity in the use of ultrasonography in scaphoid fracture diagnosis. However, multiple factors including technical differences in ultrasound machines and probes, small sample sizes and variability of subsequent confirmatory tests have created a challenge in determining the ultimate reliability of ultrasonography in the diagnosis of occult scaphoid fractures. Considering these factors and limitations, large-sample and high-quality clinical trials are needed to adequately assess its reliability for this purpose. One stop clinics, in the authors' opinion, would be an ideal setting for its introduction as well as for future trials."

TFIIH is comprised of two subcomplexes, the core subcomplex (seven subunits) including XPB and XPD helicases and the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)-activating kinase (CAK) subcomplex (three subunits) containing CDK7 kinase. Recently, it has been reported that spironolactone, an anti-aldosterone drug, inhibits cellular NER by inducing proteasomal degradation of XPB and potentiates the cytotoxicity of platinum-based drugs in cancer cells, suggesting possible drug repositioning. In this study, we have tried to uncover the mechanism underlying the chemical-induced XPB destabilization. Based on siRNA library screening and subsequent analyses, we identified SCFFBXL18 E3 ligase consisting of Skp1, Cul1, F-box protein FBXL18 and Rbx1 responsible for spironolactone-induced XPB polyubiquitination and degradation. In addition, we showed that CDK7 kinase activity is required for this process. Finally, we found that the Ser90 residue of XPB is essential for the chemical-induced destabilization. These results led us to propose a model that spironolactone may trigger the phosphorylation of XPB at Ser90 by CDK7, which promotes the recognition and polyubiquitination of XPB by SCFFBXL18 for proteasomal degradation.",Is a Bent Crystal Still a Single Crystal?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30762922,Angewandte Chemie (International ed. in English),2019 04 29,"The mention of the word ""crystal"" invokes images of minerals, gems, and rocks, all of which are inevitably solid, hard, and durable entities with well-defined smooth faces and straight edges. With the discovery in the first half of the 20th century that many molecular crystals are soft and can be deformed in a similar way as rubber or plastic, this perception is changing, and both the concept and formal definition of what a crystal is may require reinterpretation. The seemingly naïve question posed in the title of this Minireview does not have a simple answer. Here, we discuss how the effects of the elastic and plastic deformation of molecular crystals on the diffraction signature give primary evidence of their degree of crystallinity. In most cases, the definition of a crystal holds for both elastically and plastically deformed crystals and, unless there is significant or complete physical separation of the crystal during the deformation, they can safely be considered (deformed) single crystals with a high concentration of defects.",Parotidectomy in patients with head and neck cutaneous melanoma with cervical lymph node involvement.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30762921,Head & neck,2019 02 14,Parotidectomy in melanoma of the coronal scalp and face with clinically involved cervical lymph node metastasis is based on predicted cervical lymphatic drainage described by O'Brien.,Foliar epidermal anatomical characteristics of taxa of Iris subg.

We hypothesized that drug-effects may be expressed differently depending on whether the rat is in active locomotion or sitting still during recording sessions, and proposed automatic state-detection as a viable tool for estimating drug-effects free of hypo-/hyperlocomotion-induced effects. We aimed at developing a fully automatic and validated method for detecting two behavioural states: active and inactive, in one-second intervals and to use the method for evaluating ketamine, DOI, d-cycloserine, d-amphetamine, and diazepam effects specifically within each state. The developed state-detector attained high precision with more than 90% of the detected time correctly classified, and multiple differences between the two detected states were discovered. Ketamine-induced delta activity was found specifically related to locomotion. Ketamine and DOI suppressed theta and beta oscillations exclusively during inactivity. Characteristic gamma and high-frequency oscillations (HFO) enhancements of the NMDAR and 5HT2A modulators, speculated associated with locomotion, were profound and often largest during the inactive state. State-specific analyses, theoretically eliminating biases from altered occurrence of locomotion, revealed only few effects of d-amphetamine and diazepam. Overall, drug-effects were most abundant in the inactive state. In conclusion, this new validated and automatic locomotion state-detection method enables fast and reliable state-specific analysis facilitating discovery of state-dependent drug-effects and control for altered occurrence of locomotion. This may ultimately lead to better cross-species translation of electrophysiological effects of pharmacological modulations.",Effect of oxidative stress in rostral ventrolateral medulla on sympathetic hyperactivity after traumatic brain injury.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30762917,The European journal of neuroscience,2019 04 01,"Sympathetic hyperactivity occurs in a subgroup of patients after traumatic brain injury (TBI). The rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) is a key region for the activity of sympathetic nervous system. Oxidative stress in the RVLM is proved to be responsible for the increased level of sympathetic activity in animal models of hypertension and heart failure. In this study, we investigated whether oxidative stress in the RVLM contributed to the development of sympathetic hyperactivity after TBI in rats. Model of diffuse axonal injury was induced using Sprague-Dawley rats, and level of mean arterial pressure (MAP) and plasma Norepinephrine (NE) was measured to evaluate the sympathetic activity. For the assessment of oxidative stress, expression of reactive oxygen species (ROS), malondialdehyde (MDA), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) in the RVLM was determined. Microinjection of Tempol into the RVLM was performed to determine the effect of oxidative stress on sympathetic hyperactivity. According to the results, TBI led to elevated MAP and plasma NE in rats. It also induced a significantly increased level of ROS, MDA production and decreased level of SOD in the RVLM. The sympathetic activity, ROS, and MDA in the RVLM decreased significantly after microinjection of Tempol. Therefore, the present results suggested that oxidative stress in the RVLM was involved in the development of sympathetic hyperactivity following TBI.","A Prospective, Multicenter Evaluation of Point-of-care Ultrasound for Small-bowel Obstruction in the Emergency Department.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30762916,Academic emergency medicine : official journal of the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine,2019 03 13,The main objective of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of emergency physician-performed point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) for the diagnosis of small-bowel obstruction (SBO) compared to computed tomography (CT).

Metal clusters with 1D or 2D structures are now accessible by template-synthesis methods, in which multiple metal atoms are arranged with the aid of template molecules and their 1D or 2D structures. However, the rational synthesis of 3D clusters remains challenging, mostly due to a lack of appropriate template molecules. Herein, we report the rational synthesis of a 2D butterfly shaped Pd4 framework (2) and 3D edge-sharing Pd6 tetrahedra (5) by treatment of easily available organosilicon compounds with Pd(CNtBu)2 . The diphenylsilylene moiety thereby serves as the key component to generate the butterfly structure of the Pd4 clusters in 2.

Specifically, high-aspect-ratio potassium niobate (KNbO3 ) ferroelectric crystals is successfully synthesized using 2D Nb2 C, MXene, and potassium hydroxide (KOH) as the niobium and potassium source, respectively. Material analysis confirms that a KNbO3 orthorhombic phase with Amm2 symmetry is obtained. Additionally, ferroelectricity in KNbO3 is confirmed using standard ferroelectric, dielectric, and piezoresponse force microscopy measurements. The KNbO3 crystals exhibit a saturated polarization of ≈21 µC cm-2 , a remnant polarization of ≈17 µC cm-2 , and a coercive field of ≈50 kV cm-1 . This discovery illustrates that the 2D nature of MXenes can be exploited to grow ferroelectric crystals.",Domain Formations and Pattern Transitions via Instabilities in Soft Heterogeneous Materials.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30762902,"Advanced materials (Deerfield Beach, Fla.)",2019 04 05,"Experimental observations of domain formations and pattern transitions in soft particulate composites under large deformations are reported herein. The system of stiff inclusions periodically distributed in a soft elastomeric matrix experiences dramatic microstructure changes upon the development of elastic instabilities. In the experiments, the formation of microstructures with antisymmetric domains and their geometrically tailored evolution into a variety of patterns of cooperative particle rearrangements are observed. Through experimental and numerical analyses, it is shown that these patterns can be tailored by tuning the initial microstructural periodicity and concentration of the inclusions. Thus, these fully determined new patterns can be achieved by fine tuning of the initial microstructure.",AMPA receptor expression in mouse testis and spermatogonial GC-1 cells: A study on its regulation by excitatory amino acids.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30762900,Journal of cellular biochemistry,2019 02 14,"Excitatory amino acids (EAAs) are found present in the nervous and reproductive systems of animals. Numerous studies have demonstrated a regulatory role for Glutamate (Glu), d-aspartate ( d-Asp) and N-methyl- d-aspartate (NMDA) in the control of spermatogenesis. EAAs are able to stimulate the Glutamate receptors, including the α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR). Here in, we assess expression of the main AMPAR subunits, GluA1 and GluA2/3, in the mouse testis and in spermatogonial GC-1 cells. The results showed that both GluA1 and GluA2/3 were localized in mouse testis prevalently in spermatogonia. The subunit GluA2/3 was more highly expressed compared with GluA1 in both the testis and the GC-1 cells. Subsequently, GC-1 cells were incubated with medium containing l-Glu, d-Glu, d-Asp or NMDA to determine GluA1 and GluA2/3 expressions. At 30 minutes and 2 hours of incubation, EAA-treated GC-1 cells showed significantly higher expression levels of both GluA1 and GluA2/3. Furthermore, p-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), p-Akt, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), and Aurora B expressions were assayed in l-Glu-, d-Glu-, and NMDA-treated GC-1 cells. At 30 minutes and 2 hours of incubation, treated GC-1 cells showed significantly higher expression levels of p-ERK and p-Akt. A consequent increase of PCNA and Aurora B expressions was induced by l-Glu and NMDA, but not by d-Glu. Our study demonstrates a direct effect of the EAAs on spermatogonial activity. In addition, the increased protein expression levels of GluA1 and GluA2/3 in EAA-treated GC-1 cells suggest that EAAs could activate ERK and Akt pathways through the AMPAR. Finally, the increased PCNA and Aurora B levels may imply an enhanced proliferative activity.",Ilexgenin A inhibits mitochondrial fission and promote Drp1 degradation by Nrf2-induced PSMB5 in endothelial cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30762899,Drug development research,2019 06 14,"Atherosclerosis (AS) is one of important events involving in the pathological process of coronary artery disease. Many traditional Chinese medicines have been widely used for the treatment of AS. Previous studies have demonstrated that Ilexgenin A (IA) obtained from Ilex hainanensis Merr. could improve AS development. However, its underlying mechanism is still unknown. This study was conducted to explore the possible targets and mechanisms involving in the anti-atheroclerosis effect of IA. The results showed IA significantly promoted NO production, reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and inflammatory cytokine production induced by palmitate (PA) in endothelial cells, demonstrating IA could improve endothelial dysfunction. Meanwhile, IA dramatically inhibited dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) expression and mitochondrial fission induced by PA whereas proteasome inhibitor epoxomicin attenuated its effect on Drp1 expression, indicating IA decreased Drp1 expression with regulation of proteasome. Furthermore, IA also could increase the expression of proteasome subunit beta type5 (PSMB5) and activate nuclear factor-like 2 (Nrf2). Nrf2 knockdown eliminated the induction effect of IA on PSMB5 expression while abrogated its inhibition on ROS generation and mitochondrial fission stimulated by PA. These results demonstrated that IA could promote PSMB5 expression in an Nrf2-dependent manner, resulting in the suppression of mitochondrial fission, and thus improve endothelial dysfunction. These findings laid a foundation to the future development of IA as an agent to the prevention and treatment of AS.",Identification of metabolites in coriander seeds (Coriandrum Sativum L.) aided by ultrahigh resolution total correlation NMR spectroscopy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30762898,Magnetic resonance in chemistry : MRC,2019 05 17,"NMR is a fast method for obtaining a holistic snapshot of the metabolome and also offers quantitative information without separating the compounds present in a complex mixture. Identification of the metabolites present in a plant extract sample is a crucial step for all plant metabolomics studies. In the present work, we used various two dimensional (2D) NMR methods such as J-resolved NMR, total correlation spectroscopy (TOCSY), and heteronuclear single quantum coherence sensitivity enhanced NMR spectroscopy for the identification of 36 common metabolites present in Coriandrum sativum L. seed extract. The identified metabolites belong to the following classes: organic acids, amino acids, and carbohydrates. 1 H NMR spectra of such complex mixtures in general display tremendous signal overlap due to the presence of a large number of metabolites with closely resonating multiplet signals. This signal overlapping leads to ambiguity in an assignment, and hence, identification of metabolites becomes tedious or impossible in many cases. Therefore, the utility of pure-shift proton spectrum along the indirect (F1 ) dimension of the F1 -PSYCHE-TOCSY spectrum is demonstrated for overcoming ambiguity in assignment of metabolites in crowded spectral regions from Coriandrum sativum L. seed extract sample. Because pure-shift NMR methods yield ultrahigh resolution spectrum (i.e., a singlet peak per chemical site) along one or more dimensions, such spectra provide better identification of metabolites compared with regular 2D TOCSY where signal overlap and peak distortions lead to ambiguity in the assignment. Nine metabolites were unambiguously assigned by pure-shift F1 -PSYCHE-TOCSY spectrum, which was unresolved in regular TOCSY spectrum.",Frontline Science: Induction of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis mobilizes Th17-promoting myeloid derived suppressor cells to the lung.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30762897,Journal of leukocyte biology,2019 04 19,"Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are a diverse group of cells that are recognized for their remarkable suppressive effects on pro-inflammatory T cells. The pleiotropic nature of these cells, however, has been demonstrated by their differential effects on immune responses in different settings. Our and others' work has demonstrated suppressive effects of these cells. We previously demonstrated that these cells were mobilized to the lungs during experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), which is a murine model of multiple sclerosis, and potently inhibited CD8+ T cell responses against influenza infection. Interestingly, they appeared to have a lesser effect on CD4+ T cells, and in fact, others have demonstrated that spleen-derived MDSCs could actually promote Th17 differentiation. We sought to determine the role of lung-derived MDSCs on EAE pathogenesis, as excursion through the lungs by pathologic CNS-Ag targeted T cells was shown to be critical for EAE induction. Our results indicate a robust accumulation of granulocytic MDSCs in the lungs of mice during EAE, which could promote Th17 polarization, and which coincided with the trafficking of autoimmune-targeted T cells through the lungs. These studies underscore the pleiotropic effect of MDSCs on T cells and their potential pro-inflammatory phenotypes in neuro-inflammatory disease. Understanding both the intrinsic multifunctional nature of these cells and the ability to influence organ-specific targets such as the CNS from remote organs such as lungs will help to elucidate both mechanisms of disease and possible new therapeutic approaches.",Tissue Repair in the Mouse Liver Following Acute Carbon Tetrachloride Depends on Injury-Induced Wnt/β-Catenin Signaling.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30762896,"Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.)",2019 05 29,"In the liver, Wnt/β-catenin signaling is involved in regulating zonation and hepatocyte proliferation during homeostasis. We examined Wnt gene expression and signaling after injury, and we show by in situ hybridization that Wnts are activated by acute carbon tetrachloride (CCl4 ) toxicity. Following injury, peri-injury hepatocytes become Wnt-responsive, expressing the Wnt target gene axis inhibition protein 2 (Axin2). Lineage tracing of peri-injury Axin2+ hepatocytes shows that during recovery the injured parenchyma becomes repopulated and repaired by Axin2+ descendants. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we show that endothelial cells are the major source of Wnts following acute CCl4 toxicity. Induced loss of β-catenin in peri-injury hepatocytes results in delayed repair and ultimately injury-induced lethality, while loss of Wnt production from endothelial cells leads to a delay in the proliferative response after injury. Conclusion: Our findings highlight the importance of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in restoring tissue integrity following acute liver toxicity and establish a role of endothelial cells as an important Wnt-producing regulator of liver tissue repair following localized liver injury.",Lusutrombopag for the Treatment of Thrombocytopenia in Patients With Chronic Liver Disease Undergoing Invasive Procedures (L-PLUS 2).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30762895,"Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.)",2019 03 29,"Thrombocytopenia may be associated with increased bleeding risk impacting timing and outcome of invasive procedures in patients with chronic liver disease (CLD). Lusutrombopag, a small-molecule, thrombopoietin (TPO) receptor agonist, was evaluated as a treatment to raise platelet counts (PCs) in patients with thrombocytopenia and CLD undergoing invasive procedures. L-PLUS 2 was a global, phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Adults with CLD and baseline PCs < 50 × 109 /L were randomized to receive once-daily lusutrombopag 3 mg or placebo ≤ 7 days before an invasive procedure scheduled 2-7 days after the last dose. The primary endpoint was avoidance of preprocedure platelet transfusion and avoidance of rescue therapy for bleeding. A key secondary endpoint was number of days PCs were ≥ 50 × 109 /L throughout the study. Safety analysis was performed on patients who received at least one dose of study drug. This study occurred between June 15, 2015, and April 19, 2017, with a total of 215 randomized patients (lusutrombopag, 108; placebo, 107); 64.8% (70/108) of patients in the lusutrombopag group versus 29.0% (31/107) in the placebo group met the primary endpoint (P < 0.0001; difference of proportion 95% confidence interval [CI], 36.7 [24.9, 48.5]). The median duration of PCs ≥ 50 × 109 /L was 19.2 days with lusutrombopag (without platelet transfusion) compared with 0.0 in the placebo group (with platelet transfusion) (P = 0.0001). Most adverse events were mild or moderate in severity, and rates were similar in the lusutrombopag and placebo groups (47.7% and 48.6%, respectively). Conclusion: Lusutrombopag was superior to placebo for reducing the need for platelet transfusions and achieved durable PC response in patients with thrombocytopenia and CLD undergoing invasive procedures, with a safety profile similar to placebo."

In this study, the presence of Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) were analysed in 25 L. helveticus genomes and identified in 23 of these genomes. A total of 40 CRISPR loci were identified and classified into five main families based on CRISPR repeats: Ldbu1, Lsal1, Lhel1, Lhel2 and a new repeat family named Lhel3. Spacers had a size between 30 and 40 bp whereas repeats have an average size of 30 bp, with three longer repeats. The analysis displayed the presence of conserved spacers in 23 of the 40 CRISPR loci. A geographical distribution of L. helveticus isolates with similar CRISPR spacer array profiles were not observed. Based on the presence of the signature protein Cas3, all CRISPR loci belonged to Type I. This analysis demonstrated a great CRISPR array variability within L. helveticus, which could be a useful tool for genotypic strain differentiation. A next step will be to understand the possible role of CRISPR/Cas system for the resistance of L. helveticus to phage infection. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Lactobacillus helveticus, a lactic acid bacteria species widely used as starter culture in the dairy industry has recently also gained importance as health-promoting culture in probiotic and nutraceutical food products. The CRISPR/Cas system, a well-known molecular mechanism that provides adaptive immunity against exogenous genetic elements such as bacteriophages and plasmids in bacteria, was recently found in this species. In this study, we investigated the presence and genetic heterogeneity of CRISPR loci in 25 L. helveticus genomes.

Co-morbid depressive symptoms predict a poor IBD course, including increased risk of relapse and surgery, which is inconsistently improved by psychological treatments. Rather than being distinct systems, there is compelling evidence for bidirectional communication between gut and brain, driven by neural, metabolic, endocrine and inflammatory mediators. An emerging concept is that depressive symptoms may be mechanistically linked to excess inflammation and dysregulation of the gut-brain axis. Given the close link between the intestinal microbiota and host immune responses, patients prone to shifts in their intestinal microbiome, including smokers, those with poor diet and early life stress, may be exposed to exaggerated immune responses. Excess inflammation is associated with brain changes (depressive symptoms, fatigue, sleep difficulties) and worsening gastrointestinal symptoms, which are exacerbated by psychological distress. Equally, treatments both for depressive symptoms and IBD provide opportunities to break this cycle by reducing the causes and effects of inflammation. As well as addressing potential risk factors such as smoking and diet, treatments to alter the microbiome may reduce depressive symptoms. Observational evidence suggests that anti-inflammatory treatments for IBD may improve co-morbid depressive symptoms correlating with reduction in inflammation. With a growing range of treatments targeting inflammation centrally, peripherally and in the gut, IBD provides a unique model to understand the interplay between brain and gut in the pathogenesis of depressive symptoms, both in IBD and in the whole population.","Cancer statistics for African Americans, 2019.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30762872,CA: a cancer journal for clinicians,2019 05 06,"In the United States, African American/black individuals bear a disproportionate share of the cancer burden, having the highest death rate and the lowest survival rate of any racial or ethnic group for most cancers. To monitor progress in reducing these inequalities, every 3 years the American Cancer Society provides the estimated number of new cancer cases and deaths for blacks in the United States and the most recent data on cancer incidence, mortality, survival, screening, and risk factors using data from the National Cancer Institute, the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries, and the National Center for Health Statistics. In 2019, approximately 202,260 new cases of cancer and 73,030 cancer deaths are expected to occur among blacks in the United States. During 2006 through 2015, the overall cancer incidence rate decreased faster in black men than in white men (2.4% vs 1.7% per year), largely due to the more rapid decline in lung cancer. In contrast, the overall cancer incidence rate was stable in black women (compared with a slight increase in white women), reflecting increasing rates for cancers of the breast, uterine corpus, and pancreas juxtaposed with declining trends for cancers of the lung and colorectum. Overall cancer death rates declined faster in blacks than whites among both males (2.6% vs 1.6% per year) and females (1.5% vs 1.3% per year), largely driven by greater declines for cancers of the lung, colorectum, and prostate. Consequently, the excess risk of overall cancer death in blacks compared with whites dropped from 47% in 1990 to 19% in 2016 in men and from 19% in 1990 to 13% in 2016 in women. Moreover, the black-white cancer disparity has been nearly eliminated in men <50 years and women ≥70 years. Twenty-five years of continuous declines in the cancer death rate among black individuals translates to more than 462,000 fewer cancer deaths. Continued progress in reducing disparities will require expanding access to high-quality prevention, early detection, and treatment for all Americans.",Maternal outcome after complete uterine rupture.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30762871,Acta obstetricia et gynecologica Scandinavica,2019 03 11,"Complete uterine rupture, a rare peripartum complication, is often associated with a catastrophic outcome for both mother and child. However, few studies have investigated large datasets to evaluate maternal outcomes after complete ruptures, particularly in unscarred uteri. This paucity of studies is partly due to the rarity of both the event and the serious outcomes, such as peripartum hysterectomy and maternal death. The incidence of uterine rupture is expected to increase, due to increasing cesarean section rates worldwide. Thus, it is important to have more complete knowledge about the immediate maternal outcome following a complete uterine rupture. The objective was to identify maternal outcomes and their risk factors following complete uterine ruptures.",Geometry and energetics of CO adsorption on hydroxylated UiO-66.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30762868,Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP,2019 02 28,"The metal-organic framework (MOF), UiO-66, contains Brønsted acidic and Lewis acidic sites that play an important role in sorption, separation, and potential catalytic processes involving small gaseous molecules. As such, studies into the sequestration and separation of CO within UiO-66 provides a fundamental understanding of small gas molecule adsorption within a highly porous, tunable and environmentally stable MOF. Infrared spectroscopic measurements, in combination with density functional theory, were employed to characterize the binding energetics between bridging hydroxyl groups at MOF nodes and the adsorbate, CO. Two unique binding configurations between CO and the μ3-OH groups were identified based on differing stretching vibrations of COads when interacting through the C- and O-atom of the molecule. Variable temperature infrared spectroscopy (VTIR) was employed to attain energetics of CO adsorption (-17 kJ mol-1) and isomerization from the carbonyl to the isocarbonyl configuration (4 kJ mol-1). Results suggest that CO-hydroxyl interactions, while weak in nature, play a critical role in CO adsorption within the confined pore environment of UiO-66.",DEM simulation of the local ordering of tetrahedral granular matter.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30762865,Soft matter,2019 03 08,"The formation and growth of local order clusters in a tetrahedral granular assembly driven by 3D mechanical vibration were captured in DEM (discrete element method) dynamic simulation using a multi-sphere model. Two important kinds of clusters, dimer and wagon wheel structures, were observed based on which the growth behavior and mechanism of each local cluster with different orientations/structures were investigated. The results show that during vibration, dimer clusters are formed first and then most of them grow into linear trimers and tetramers. Wagon wheel clusters are also frequently observed that grow into hexamers and, further, octamer and nonamer local clusters. Coordination number (CN) evolution indicates that the decrease of local mean CN can be regarded as the signal for the formation of local clusters in the tetrahedral particle packing system. Nematic order metric analysis shows that although the two basic structures (dimer and wagon wheel structures) grow into complex local clusters during packing densification, these local clusters are randomly distributed in the tetrahedral particle packing system. Stress analysis indicates that the dimer-based local clusters are mostly formed in the compaction state of the tetrahedral particle packing system during the vibrated packing densification process. In comparison, the wagon wheel-based local clusters need much stronger interaction forces from tetrahedral particles during vibrated packing densification.",Ionic transport in highly concentrated lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)amide electrolytes with keto ester solvents: structural implications for ion hopping conduction in liquid electrolytes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30762863,Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP,2019 02 28,"Recent studies have suggested that a Li ion hopping or ligand- or anion-exchange mechanism is largely involved in Li ion conduction of highly concentrated liquid electrolytes. To understand the determining factors for the Li ion hopping/exchange dominant conduction in such liquid systems, ionic diffusion behavior and Li ion coordination structures of concentrated liquid electrolytes composed of lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)amide (Li[FSA]) and keto ester solvents with two carbonyl coordinating sites of increasing intramolecular distance (methyl pyruvate (MP), methyl acetoacetate (MA), and methyl levulinate (ML)) were studied. Diffusivity measurements of MP- and MA-based concentrated electrolytes showed faster Li ion diffusion than the solvent and FSA anion, demonstrating that Li ion diffusion was dominated by the Li ion hopping/exchange mechanism. A solvent-bridged, chain-like Li ion coordination structure and highly aggregated ion pairs (AGGs) or ionic clusters e.g. Lix[FSA]y(y-x)- forming in the electrolytes were shown to contribute to Li ion hopping conduction. By contrast, ML, with greater intramolecular distance between the carbonyl moieties, is more prone to form a bidentate complex with a Li cation, which increased the contribution of the vehicle mechanism to Li ion diffusion even though similar AGGs and ionic clusters were also observed. The clear correlation between the unusual Li ion diffusion and the solvent-bridged, chain-like structure provides an important insight into the design principles for fast Li ion conducting liquid electrolytes that would enable Li ion transport decoupled from viscosity-controlled mass transfer processes.",Germylone-bridged bimetallic Ir and Rh complexes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30762862,"Dalton transactions (Cambridge, England : 2003)",2019 03 13,"The reactions of germylone 1 with one equivalent of [M(COD)Cl]2 (M = Ir, Rh) afforded the germylone-bridged bimetallic complexes 2 and 3, which have been spectroscopically and structurally characterized.

More pieces of evidence indicate that the transverse vibrations of N atoms dominate the NTE behavior of FeFe(CN)6. The present results prove directly that the transverse thermal vibrations of C and N atoms are crucial for the occurrence of the NTE of Prussian blue analogues.",Enhanced microwave absorption properties of PMMA modified MnFe2O4-polyaniline nanocomposites.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30762850,Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP,2019 02 28,"A manganese based spinel ferrite, chemically modified with polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) and polyaniline (PANI) are synthesized and their composites are used as electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding materials. X-ray diffraction studies show that the as-prepared manganese ferrite crystallizes in a cubic spinel structure. The particles are highly agglomerated and nanocrystalline as indicated by transmission electron microscopy. Manganese exists in +2 and +4 oxidation states and Fe in +2 and +3 oxidation states. Modified manganese ferrite and polyaniline composites in different weight ratios are evaluated for their EMI shielding properties. It is observed that composites containing the PMMA modified ferrite show enhanced total shielding effectiveness (SET) compared to those containing the unmodified ferrite in the X band frequency range (8-12 GHz). The optimized ratio of the PMMA modified ferrite and PANI demonstrates SET values as high as ∼44 dB in the X band frequency range.",Analysis of the interfacial characteristics of BiVO4/metal oxide heterostructures and its implication on their junction properties.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30762849,Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP,2019 02 28,"The formation of heterostructures has proven to be a viable way to achieve high photoelectrochemical water splitting efficiencies with BiVO4 based photoanodes. Especially, cobalt and nickel based oxides are suitable low cost contact materials. However, the exact role of these contact materials is not yet completely understood because of the difficulty to individually quantify the effects of surface passivation, charge carrier separation and catalysis on the efficiency of a heterostructure. In this study, we used photoelectron spectroscopy in combination with in situ thin film deposition to obtain direct information on the interface structure between polycrystalline BiVO4 and NiO, CoOx and Sn-doped In2O3 (ITO). Strong upwards band bending was observed for the BiVO4/NiO and BiVO4/CoOx interfaces without observing chemical changes in BiVO4, while limited band bending and reduction of Bi and V was observed while forming the BiVO4/ITO interface. Thus, the tunability of the Fermi level position within BiVO4 seems to be limited to a certain range. The feasibility of high upwards band bending through junctions with high work function (WF) compounds demonstrate that nickel oxide and cobalt oxide are able to enhance the charge carrier separation in BiVO4. Similar studies could help to identify whether new photoelectrode materials and their heterostructures would be suitable for photoelectrochemical water splitting.",Tumor cell capture from blood by flowing across antibody-coated surfaces.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30762848,Lab on a chip,2019 05 03,"The load of circulating tumor cells (CTC) is related to poor outcomes in cancer patients. A sufficient number of these cells would enable a full characterization of the cancer. An approach to probe larger blood volumes, allowing for the detection of more of these very rare CTC, is the use of leukapheresis. Currently available techniques allow only the analysis of a small portion of leukapheresis products. Here, we present a method that uses flow rather than static conditions which allows processing of larger volumes. We evaluated the conditions needed to isolate tumor cells from blood while passing antibody coated surfaces. Results show that our set-up efficiently captures cancer cells from whole blood. Results show that the optimal velocity at which cells are captured from blood is 0.6 mm s-1. Also, it can be concluded that the VU1D9 antibody targeting the EpCAM antigen has very high capture efficiency. When using an antibody that does not capture 100% of all cells, combining multiple antibodies on the capture surface is very beneficial leading to an increase in cell capture and is therefore worthwhile considering in any cancer cell capture methodology.",Crossing Boundaries to Advance Nursing Research Education.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30762847,Journal for nurses in professional development,2019 05 02,"Nursing professional development specialists may find it challenging time and cost-wise to meet the educational needs of nurses in the areas of research and evidence-based practice amidst competing education priorities.

Smoking status was classified into current smokers, never smokers, and ex-smokers. Hyperuricemia was defined as > 7.0 mg/dL for men and > 6.0 mg/dL of serum uric acid for women. Association between smoking and serum uric acid/hyperuricemia was assessed by Pearson's or Spearman's correlation analyses and multivariate logistic regression analysis showing odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI).A significant difference in serum uric acid according to smoking status was identified in female (P < .001) but not in male subjects (P = .069). In female subjects, current smokers and ex-smokers showed higher serum uric acid than never smokers (P < 0.001 of both). Serum uric acid was associated with smoking status in female but not male subjects (r = 0.057, P = .001 and r = 0.025, P = .220, respectively). There was significant difference of smoking status between female subjects with and without hyperuricemia (P < .001). Current smokers had 2.7 times higher likely to have hyperuricemia in female, compared to never smokers (OR 2.674, 95% CI 1.578 - 4.531, P < .001).This study revealed that smoking was closely associated with serum uric acid in female but not in male subjects in Korean population.",Effectiveness of extracorporeal shock-wave therapy for frozen shoulder: A protocol for a systematic review of randomized controlled trial.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30762780,Medicine,2019 03 29,This systematic review aims to explore the effectiveness and safety of extracorporeal shock-wave therapy (ESWT) for patients with frozen shoulder.,Effect of Pro-kin visual feedback balance training system on gait stability in patients with cerebral small vessel disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30762779,Medicine,2019 03 29,"Due to the indistinct nature of symptoms for Cerebral Small Vessel Disease (CSVD), diagnosis is often missed. With significant deterioration of movement disorder, risk of falls increases dramatically.Comparison study was conducted to explore the association between balance function and gait instability, and the treatment effectiveness of visual feedback balance training on the gait disorder in CSVD patients.Fifty-six patients with CSVD were studied. They were randomly divided into observation and control groups, and were given conventional gait rehabilitation training, including single-leg weight, shift of the center of gravity, step and hip extension training, stepping up and down on stairs with the affected leg, standing up with hip extension and support of the leg, lateral walking, and in situ walking. Training was performed twice a day for 20 minutes each for 4 consecutive weeks. In addition, the observation group received balance training using Pro-Kin visual feedback balance training system. Both groups were evaluated prior and post-treatment using the Tinetti Scale and the Pro-Kin Visual Feedback Balance Training System. For the Tinetti Scale, lower score indicates more serious gait balance dysfunction. For the Pro-Kin, greater length means poorer balance function. Larger area means poorer balance function. Smaller value of the 2 parameters indicates better balance function.After training, the trajectory lengths and areas of orbital motions were significantly decreased (P < .05). However greater decrease was seen in the observation group (P < .01). The trajectory length and area for both groups were less when the eyes open than closed (P < .01). The Tinetti scores for balance and gait functions of both groups improved significantly (P < .05). However, the observation group showed even greater results than the control group (P < .01). Results from Person test showed there was a significant correlation between balance and gait functions.Combination of visual feedback balance training with conventional rehabilitation treatment could gain a greater result than conventional rehabilitation alone. It indicates that balance training may serve as an additional method for gait stability training for CSVD patients.",Impact of a home health care program for disabled patients in Taiwan: A nationwide population-based cohort study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30762778,Medicine,2019 03 29,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of home health care (HHC) for disabled patients.We conducted a nationwide population-based retrospective cohort study.

After 1:1 matching, 2901 subjects in the HHC group and 2901 subjects in the non-HHC group were selected and analyzed. Generalized estimating equations (GEEs) were used to compare the risk of health outcomes (rate of hospitalization and emergency services use) and the healthcare expenditure between the 2 groups.Compared to those in the non-HHC group, the patients in the HHC group had significantly higher risk for hospitalization (odds ratio [OR] = 18.43, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 15.62-21.75, P < .001) and emergency services use (OR = 3.72, 95% CI: 3.32-4.17, P < .001) 1 year before the index date. However, 1 year after the index date, the risk for hospitalization (OR = 1.6, 95% CI: 1.41-1.83, P < .001) and emergency services use (OR = 1.16, 95% CI: 1.04-1.30, P < .05) attenuated significantly. Regarding the comparison of total healthcare expenditure 1 year before and after the index date, our study showed an insignificant decrease of US$1.5 per person per day and a significant increase of US$5.2 per person per day (P < .001) in the HHC and non-HHC groups, respectively.The HHC for disabled patients has a potential role to reduce hospitalization and emergency services use. Besides, the improvement of healthcare quality through HHC was not accompanied by increased healthcare expenditure. The clinical impact of HHC emphasizes the importance for public health officials to promote HHC model to meet the needs of disabled patients."

We investigated the impact of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) on advanced nursing care and medical costs.We used Longitudinal Health Insurance Database to implement a cohort study of patients with dementia between 1997 and 2012 in Taiwan. Data from the onset of dementia to 1st advanced nursing care for the endotracheal tube, urinal indwelling catheterization, and nasogastric tube were assessed using Cox regression proportional hazards model, and independent t test was used to determine the difference of hospitalization costs and days. We also used ANOVA test to compare the hospital cost, hospital stay, and numbers according to different duration of TCM.We assessed 9438 new diagnosed patients with dementia without advanced nursing care were categorized into 2 groups: 4094 (43.4%) TCM users, and 5344 (56.6%) non-TCM users. In the TCM groups, 894 (21.8%) patients were declared as advanced nursing care, while 1683 (31.5%) patients were in non-TCM group. Cox proportional hazard regression indicated that using TCM may decrease the need for advanced nursing care (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) = 0.61, 95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 0.56-0.66) compared to non-TCM. The TCM users have lower hospitalization costs and hospitalization time compared to non-TCM users.Integrating TCM healthcare into dementia care was found to be associated with a lower need for advanced nursing care, hospitalization costs, and admission time with more benefits from longer durations of TCM use.",Increased risk of neurodegenerative dementia in women with migraines: A nested case-control study using a national sample cohort.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30762763,Medicine,2019 03 29,"The present study aimed to evaluate the association between migraines and dementia.Data were collected from 11,438 dementia participants who were 1:4 matched by age, sex, income, region of residence, hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia with 45,752 controls from the Korean National Health Insurance Service-National Sample Cohort from 2002 to 2013.

Both can cause severe pain and are considered to have a mechanism of action, including dysfunction of the sympathetic nervous system. However, they have clinical differences in pain range and degree. The present study aimed to find neurophysiologic differences between CRPS and FM using quantitative electroencephalography (QEEG). Thirty-eight patients with CRPS and 33 patients with FM were included in the analysis. Resting-state QEEG data were grouped into frontal, central, and posterior regions to analyze for regional differences. General linear models were utilized to test for group differences in absolute and relative powers. As a result, the CRPS group relative to FM group showed lower total absolute powers in the beta band (F = 5.159, P < .05), high beta (F = 14.120, P < .05), and gamma band (F = 15.034, P < .05). There were no significant differences between 2 groups in the delta, theta, and alpha bands. The present findings show that the CRPS and FM groups differ mainly in the high frequency, which may reflect their distinct pathophysiology and symptomatology. Our study suggests that the QEEG differences can be clinically useful in assessing brain function in patients with CRPS and FM.",Effects of aging and menopause on pancreatic fat fraction in healthy women population: A strobe-compliant article.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30762758,Medicine,2019 03 29,"Pancreatic fat fraction has been shown to increase in many pathological situations.

A phantom of fat-water mixtures was established. One hundred sixty-seven healthy women (20-70 years) were recruited. Fat fraction was quantified with double-echo chemical shift magnetic resonance imaging with T1 and T2* correction. The association between measured and actual fat fractions was determined with Pearson correlation. Linear regression analysis was used to establish the calibration curve. Fat fractions were analyzed via analysis of variance.A significant positive linear correlation was revealed between the measured and actual fat fractions on the phantom (r = 0.991, P < .001).

The control group were given intravenous fluids with saline-based solutions and unlimited volumes of hydroxyethyl starch solutions and the RPF group were given intravenous fluids with RPF. The primary outcome was the incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic dialysis within 12 months after cardiovascular surgery. Multivariable regression and propensity analyses were performed to evaluate the association between perioperative fluid management strategy and postoperative renal outcomes.Postoperative AKI and chronic dialysis occurred in 213 (21.2%) and 5 (0.5%) patients in the RPF group compared with 696 (43.2%) and 38 (2.4%) patients in the control group, respectively. After adjustment, the RPF group was linked to a decreased risk of postoperative AKI, severe AKI, persistent AKI, use of renal replacement therapy, chronic kidney disease, chronic dialysis, and a shorter postoperative extubation time and intensive care unit, and hospital stay duration.The perioperative fluid management strategy with balanced solutions and a limited volume of hydroxyethyl starch was related to improved acute and 1-year renal and clinical outcomes after cardiovascular surgery.

The number and weight of trays and instruments processed were reduced substantially after the optimization intervention, particularly for TKA. Setup time was reduced by 23% (6 minutes, P = .01) for TKA procedures but did not differ for THA. The number of survey respondents was small, but satisfaction was high overall among personnel involved in implementation.Optimizing instrumentation trays for orthopedic procedures yielded reduction in processing time and cost. Future research should evaluate patient outcomes and incremental/additive impact on institutional quality measures."

Blockade of regulatory checkpoint molecules can, however, also result in aberrant immune activation leading to undesirable inflammation and autoimmunity. Although many genetic determinants have been described in patients with primary autoimmune diseases, it is uncertain whether patients developing autoimmune skin disease as an adverse effect of anti-PD-1 therapy share the same genetic risks. Furthermore, it is also unclear whether treatment with these agents can result in the unveiling of underlying 'silent' autoimmunity resulting in chronic inflammatory disease. We report three cases of cutaneous lupus associated with pembrolizumab therapy for advanced melanoma. One patient had a previous diagnosis of histologically proven discoid lupus erythematosus, well-controlled without treatment for over 2 years, which flared on first exposure to pembrolizumab. The remaining two patients had no previous history of autoimmune disease; both developed cutaneous eruptions, histologically and immunohistologically, in keeping with subacute cutaneous lupus following treatment with pembrolizumab. Our report bolsters what is currently an exceedingly small body of evidence documenting the development of cutaneous lupus in the setting of pembrolizumab therapy. Our third case specifically documents an otherwise unreported severe reflare of previously diagnosed, quiescent discoid lupus erythematosus in the setting of pembrolizumab, vividly highlighting the potential for autoimmune and specifically, lupus reactivation in the setting of anti-PD-1 therapy.",RNA m6A methyltransferase METTL3 regulates invasiveness of melanoma cells by matrix metallopeptidase 2.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30762711,Melanoma research,2019 02 14,"The development of immunotherapy has improved the treatment of melanoma; however, resistance and frequent recurrence persist and remain a major problem. N-methyladenosine (mA) is the most abundant epitranscriptomic mark on mRNA and is essential for various physiological processes; however, its role in melanoma is unknown. Utilizing human normal melanocyte and melanoma cell lines, we analyzed the expression of METTL3 by quantitative RT-PCR. We inhibited the METTL3 expression by shRNA and analyzed the effects on melanoma cell proliferation, colony formation ability, and invasion. Finally, we assessed the role of METTL3 by using wild-type and mA catalytic site mutant METTL3. Melanoma cell lines express higher levels of METTL3, as compared with normal melanocytes. Interestingly, silencing of METTL3 gene expression in melanoma cells resulted in decreased mA activity, colony formation and invasiveness, while its overexpression led to increased mA activity, colony formation and invasion. METTL3 overexpression promotes accumulation of MMP2 and N-cadherin in melanoma cells. Strikingly, the overexpression of mA catalytic site mutant METTL3 was unable to produce a similar increase in MMP2 expression, suggesting that mA activity of METTL3 is important for melanoma cell invasiveness. Our results for the first time uncover the role of mA modification in melanoma cell biology. We show that METTL3 is upregulated in human melanoma and plays a role in invasion/migration through MMP2. These findings provide the framework for the development and use of METTL3 inhibitors in melanoma treatment.",Addressing adverse childhood experiences in diverse racial and ethnic settings: a review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30762707,Current opinion in pediatrics,2019 03 07,This article reviews the current literature on adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) with particular focus on racial and ethnic factors.,What is new in electronic-cigarettes research?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30762705,Current opinion in pediatrics,2019 06 12,"Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) and other vaping devices have seen extraordinary growth in use in the past 10 years, and companies are accelerating their development of new products and marketing efforts.

Steady-state 50 Hz measurements of left ventricular assist device (LVAD) flow (Q) and pressures within the proximal and distal outflow conduit were obtained at varying pump speed, LV contractility, hematocrit (HCT), heart rate (HR), and conduit diameter and length. Experiments were conducted using polyvinyl chloride (PVC) tubing and results confirmed in HVAD Gelweave conduit. Conduit diameter was negatively and nonlinearly associated with mean and peak gradient in both the PVC and HVAD conduits. There were no significant differences between the PVC and HVAD conduits in terms of mean Q, systolic dQdt, mean conduit gradient, or peak gradient. Across the 10 mm HVAD conduit, mean gradient correlated linearly with mean Q, systolic dQdt, HCT, and conduit length (r = 0.91), whereas peak gradient correlated with mean Q, systolic dQdt, and conduit length (r = 0.93). A nonlinear model to determine instantaneous gradient was highly predictive (r = 0.83) across a range of pump and circulatory conditions. In summary, hemodynamically significant pressure gradients are observed across the LVAD outflow conduit under physiologic conditions, which may result in diminished pump flow."

A novel model for a nonlinear active suspension system is established, in which uncertain parameters, unknown friction forces, nonlinear springs and dampers, and performance requirements are considered simultaneously. In order to deal with the nonlinear characteristics, a backstepping control strategy is developed. Meanwhile, an adaptive control strategy is proposed to handle the uncertain parameters and unknown friction forces. In the cloud-aided vehicle suspension system framework, the adaptive backstepping controller is updated in a remote cloud based on the cloud storing information, such as road information, vehicle suspension information, and reference trajectories. Finally, simulation results for a full vehicle with 7-degree of freedom model are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme, and it is shown that the addressed controller can improve the performances more than 80% compared with passive vehicle suspension systems.",Finite-Time Coordination Behavior of Multiple Euler-Lagrange Systems in Cooperation-Competition Networks.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30762574,IEEE transactions on cybernetics,2019 05 13,"In this paper, the finite-time coordination behavior of multiple Euler-Lagrange systems in cooperation-competition networks is investigated, where the coupling weights can be either positive or negative. Then, two auxiliary variables about the information exchange among agents are designed, and the finite-time distributed protocol is proposed based on the auxiliary variables and the property of the Euler-Lagrange system. By combining the approach of adding a power integrator with the homogeneous domination method, it is shown that finite-time bipartite consensus can be achieved if the cooperation-competition network is structurally balanced and the parameters of the distributed protocol are chosen appropriately; otherwise, finite-time distributed stabilization can be achieved. Furthermore, from the perspective of network decomposition, the finite-time coordination behavior is further considered, and some sufficient conditions about the cooperation subnetwork and the competition subnetwork are obtained. As an extension, finite-time coordination behavior only with partial state information of the neighbors is discussed, and some similar results are obtained.

The color fundus image (CFI) is the most common modality used for ocular screening. In CFI, the central region which is the optic disc and the optic cup region within the disc are examined to determine one of the important cues for glaucoma diagnosis called the optic cup-to-disc ratio (CDR). CDR calculation requires accurate segmentation of optic disc and cup. Another important cue for glaucoma progression is the variation of depth in ONH region. In this work, we first propose a deep learning framework to estimate depth from a single fundus image. For the case of monocular retinal depth estimation, we are also plagued by the labelled data insufficiency. To overcome this problem we adopt the technique of pretraining the deep network where, instead of using a denoising autoencoder, we propose a new pretraining scheme called pseudo-depth reconstruction, which serves as a proxy task for retinal depth estimation. Empirically, we show pseudo-depth reconstruction to be a better proxy task than denoising. Our results outperform the existing techniques for depth estimation on the INSPIRE dataset. To extend the use of depth map for optic disc and cup segmentation, we propose a novel fully convolutional guided network, where, along with the color fundus image the network uses the depth map as a guide. We propose a convolutional block called multimodal feature extraction block to extract and fuse the features of the color image and the guide image. We extensively evaluate the proposed segmentation scheme on three datasets- ORIGA, RIMONEr3 and DRISHTI-GS. The performance of the method is comparable and in many cases, outperforms the most recent state-of-the-art.",Discovering the Type 2 Diabetes in Electronic Health Records using the Sparse Balanced Support Vector Machine.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30762572,IEEE journal of biomedical and health informatics,2019 02 14,"The diagnosis of Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) at an early stage has a key role for an adequate T2D integrated management system and patient's follow-up. Recent years have witnessed an increasing amount of available Electronic Health Record (EHR) data and Machine Learning (ML) techniques have been considerably evolving. However, managing and modeling this amount of information may lead to several challenges such as overfitting, model interpretability and computational cost. Starting from these motivations, we introduced a ML method called Sparse Balanced Support Vector Machine (SB-SVM) for discovering T2D in a novel collected EHR dataset (named FIMMG dataset). In particular, among all the EHR features related to exemptions, examination and drug prescriptions we have selected only those collected before T2D diagnosis from a uniform age group of subjects. We demonstrated the reliability of the introduced approach with respect to other ML and Deep Learning approaches widely employed in the state-of-the-art for solving this task. Results evidence that the SB-SVM overcomes the other state-of-the-art competitors providing the best compromise between predictive performance and computation time. Additionally, the induced sparsity allows to increase the model interpretability, while implicitly managing high dimensional data and the usual unbalanced class distribution.",Artificial neural network for in-bed posture classification using bed-sheet pressure sensors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30762571,IEEE journal of biomedical and health informatics,2019 02 14,"Pressure ulcer prevention is a vital procedure for patients undergoing long-term hospitalization. A human body lying posture (HBLP) monitoring system is essential to reschedule posture change for patients. Video-surveillance, the conventional method of HBLP monitoring, suffers from various limitations, such as subject's privacy, and field-of view obstruction. We propose an autonomous method for classifying the four state-of-art HBLPs in healthy adult subjects: supine, prone, left and right lateral, with no sensors or cables attached on the body and no constraints imposed on the subject. Experiments have been conducted on 12 healthy adults (age 27.35 ± 5.39 years) using a collection of textile pressure sensors embedded in a cover placed under the bed-sheet. Histogram of oriented gradients and local binary patterns were extracted and fed to a supervised artificial neural network classification model. The model was trained based on the scaled conjugate gradient back-propagation. A nested cross-validation with an exhaustive outer validation-loop was performed to validate the classification's generalization performance. A high testing prediction accuracy of 97.9% with a Cohen's Kappa coefficient of 97.2% have been interestingly obtained. Prone and supine postures were successfully separated in the classification, in contrast to the majority of previous similar works. We found that using the information of body weight distribution along with the shape and edges contributes to a better classification performance, and the ability to separate supine and prone postures. The results are satisfactorily promising towards unobtrusively monitoring posture for ulcer prevention. The method can be used in sleep studies, post-surgical procedures or applications requiring HBLP identification.",Memristive Imitation of Synaptic Transmission and Plasticity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30762570,IEEE transactions on neural networks and learning systems,2019 02 14,"In this paper, a memristive artificial neural circuit imitating the excitatory chemical synaptic transmission of biological synapse is designed.

Moreover, the memristive artificial circuit also mimics the distinct biological attributes of strong stimulation and deficient synthesis of neurotransmitters.

However, this assumption ignores the intraclass compactness and the interclass separability simultaneously. We believe that human actions should occupy multimanifold subspace and, therefore, model the samples of the same action as the same manifold and those of different actions as different manifolds. In order to obtain the optimum subspace projection matrix, the current approaches may be mathematically imprecise owe to the badly scaled matrix and improper convergence. To address these issues in unconstrained convex optimization, we introduce a nontrivial spectral projected gradient method and Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions without matrix inversion. Through maximizing the separability between different classes by using labeled data points and estimating the intrinsic geometric structure of the data distributions by exploring unlabeled data points, the proposed algorithm can learn global and local consistency and boost the recognition performance. Extensive experiments conducted on the realistic video data sets, including JHMDB, HMDB51, UCF50, and UCF101, have demonstrated that our algorithm outperforms the compared algorithms, including deep learning approach when there are only a few labeled samples.","Proprioceptive Localization of the Fingers: Coarse, Biased, and Context-Sensitive.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30762567,IEEE transactions on haptics,2019 02 22,"The proprioceptive sense provides somatosensory information about positions of parts of the body, information that is essential for guiding behavior and monitoring the body. Few studies have investigated the perceptual localization of individual fingers, despite their importance for tactile exploration and fine manipulation. We present two experiments assessing the performance of proprioceptive localization of multiple fingers, either alone or in combination with visual cues. In the first experiment, we used a virtual reality paradigm to assess localization of multiple fingers. Surprisingly, the errors averaged 3.7 cm per digit, which represents a significant fraction of the range of motion of any finger. Both random and systematic errors were large. The latter included participant-specific biases and participant-independent distortions that evoked similar observations from prior studies of perceptual representations of hand shape. In a second experiment, we introduced visual cues about positions of nearby fingers, and observed that this contextual information could greatly decrease localization errors. The results suggest that only coarse proprioceptive information is available through somatosensation, and that finer information may not be necessary for fine motor behavior. These findings may help elucidate human hand function, and inform new applications to the design of human-computer interfaces or interactions in virtual reality.",Oscillatory Dynamics of p53-Mdm2 Circuit in Response to DNA Damage Caused by Ionizing Radiation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30762566,IEEE/ACM transactions on computational biology and bioinformatics,2019 02 22,"Although the dynamical behavior of the p53-Mdm2 loop has been extensively studied, the understanding of the mechanism underlying the regulation of this pathway still remains limited. Herein, we developed an integrated model with five basic components and three ubiquitous time delays for the p53- Mdm2 interaction in response to DNA damage following ionizing radiation (IR). We showed that a sufficient amount of activated ATM level can initiate the p53 oscillations with nearly the same amplitude over a wide range of the ATM level; a proper range of p53 level is also required for generating the oscillations, for too high or too low levels it would fail to generate the oscillations; and increased Mdm2 level leads to decreased amplitude of the p53 oscillation and reduced expression of the p53 activity. Moreover, we found that the negative feedback loop formed between p53 and nuclear Mdm2 plays a dominant role in determining the p53 dynamics, whereas when interaction strength of the negative feedback loop becomes weaker, the positive feedback loop formed between p53 and cytoplasmatic Mdm2 can induce different types of dynamics. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the total time delay required for protein production and nuclear translocation of Mdm2 can induce p53 oscillations even when the p53 level is at a certain stable high steady state or at a certain stable low steady state. In addition, the two important features of the oscillatory dynamics-amplitude and period-can be controlled by such time delay. These results are in agreement with multiple experimental observations and may enrich our understanding of the dynamics of the p53 network."

An offline 3D numerical simulation is performed at each probe and the resulting field is encoded for runtime rendering with dynamic sources. Prior work place probes on a uniform grid, requiring high density to resolve narrow spaces. Our adaptive sampling approach varies probe density based on a novel ""local diameter"" measure of the space surrounding a given point, evaluated by stochastically tracing paths in the scene. We apply this measure to layout probes so as to smoothly adapt resolution and eliminate undersampling in corners, narrow corridors and stairways, while coarsening appropriately in more open areas. Coupled with a new runtime interpolator based on radial weights over geodesic paths, we achieve smooth acoustic effects that respect scene boundaries as both the source or listener move, unlike existing visibility-based solutions.

Combining FTVR with a spherical display enhances the 3D experience with unique properties of the spherical screen such as the enclosing shape, consistent curved surface, and borderless views from all angles around the display. The ability to generate a strong 3D effect on a spherical display with head-tracked rendering is promising for increasing user's performance in 3D tasks. An unanswered question is whether these natural affordances of spherical FTVR displays can improve spatial perception in comparison to traditional flat FTVR displays. To investigate this question, we conducted an experiment to see whether users can perceive the depth and size of virtual objects better on a spherical FTVR display compared to a flat FTVR display on two tasks. Using the spherical display, we found significantly that users had 1cm depth accuracy compared to 6.5cm accuracy using the flat display on a depth-ranking task. Likewise, their performance on a size-matching task was also significantly better with the size error of 2.3mm on the spherical display compared to 3.1mm on the flat display. Furthermore, the perception of size-constancy is stronger on the spherical display than the flat display. This study indicates that the natural affordances provided by the spherical form factor improve depth and size perception in 3D compared to a flat display. We believe that spherical FTVR displays have potential as a 3D virtual environment to provide better task performance for various 3D applications such as 3D designs, scientific visualizations, and virtual surgery.",Immersive Telepresence and Remote Collaboration using Mobile and Wearable Devices.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30762552,IEEE transactions on visualization and computer graphics,2019 04 01,"The mobility and ubiquity of mobile head-mounted displays make them a promising platform for telepresence research as they allow for spontaneous and remote use cases not possible with stationary hardware.

The remote user can then interact with this environment as if they were actually there through intuitive gesture-based interaction. Each user can obtain independent views within this environment by rotating their device, and their current field of view is shared to allow for simple coordination of viewpoints. We present several different approaches to create this shared live environment and discuss their implementation details, individual challenges, and performance on modern mobile hardware; by doing so we provide key insights into the design and implementation of next generation mobile telepresence systems, guiding future research in this domain.

To support the case, we have implemented RingText whose design is based on a circular layout with two concentric circles. The outer circle is subdivided into regions containing letters. Selection is made by using a virtual cursor controlled by the user's head movements-entering a letter region triggers a selection and moving back into the inner circle resets the selection. The design of RingText follows an iterative process, where we initially conduct one first study to investigate the optimal number of letters per region, inner circle size, and alphabet starting location. We then optimize its design by selecting the most suitable features from the first study: one letter per region, narrowing the trigger area to lower error rates, and creating candidate regions that incorporate two suggested words to appear next to the current letter region (close to the cursor) using a dynamic (rather than fixed) approach. Our second study compares text entry performance of RingText with four other hands-free techniques and the results show that RingText outperforms them. Finally, we run a third study lasting four consecutive days with 10 participants (5 novice users and 5 expert users) doing two daily sessions and the results show that RingText is quite efficient and yields a low error rate. At the end of the eighth session, the novice users can achieve a text entry speed of 11.30 WPM after 60 minutes of training while the expert (more experienced) users can reach an average text entry speed of 13.24 WPM after 90 minutes of training.",Functional Workspace Optimization via Learning Personal Preferences from Virtual Experiences.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30762550,IEEE transactions on visualization and computer graphics,2019 04 01,"The functionality of a workspace is one of the most important considerations in both virtual world design and interior design. To offer appropriate functionality to the user, designers usually take some general rules into account, e.g., general workflow and average stature of users, which are summarized from the population statistics. Yet, such general rules cannot reflect the personal preferences of a single individual, which vary from person to person. In this paper, we intend to optimize a functional workspace according to the personal preferences of the specific individual who will use it. We come up with an approach to learn the individual's personal preferences from his activities while using a virtual version of the workspace via virtual reality devices. Then, we construct a cost function, which incorporates personal preferences, spatial constraints, pose assessments, and visual field. At last, the cost function is optimized to achieve an optimal layout. To evaluate the approach, we experimented with different settings.

This encompasses two basic problems: i) the detection and deformable fitting steps are performed independently, while the detector might not provide best-suited initialization for the fitting step, ii) the face appearance varies hugely across different poses, which makes the deformable face fitting very challenging and thus distinct models have to be used (e.g., one for profile and one for frontal faces). In this work, we propose the first, to the best of our knowledge, joint multi-view convolutional network to handle large pose variations across faces in-the-wild, and elegantly bridge face detection and facial landmark localization tasks. Existing joint face detection and landmark localization methods focus only on a very small set of landmarks. By contrast, our method can detect and align a large number of landmarks for semi-frontal (68 landmarks) and profile (39 landmarks) faces. We evaluate our model on a plethora of datasets including standard static image datasets such as IBUG, 300W, COFW, and the latest Menpo Benchmark for both semi-frontal and profile faces. Significant improvement over state-of-the-art methods on deformable face tracking is witnessed on 300VW benchmark.

It requires modeling the point spread function (PSF), which captures the optical distortions entailed by the image formation process. The PSF limits the spatial resolution attainable for a given microscope. However, recent applications require a higher resolution and have prompted the development of super-resolution techniques to achieve sub-pixel accuracy. This requirement restricts the class of suitable PSF models to analog ones. In addition, deblurring is computationally intensive, hence further requiring computationally efficient models. A custom candidate fitting both the requirements is the Gaussian model. However, this model cannot capture the rich tail structures found in both the theoretical and empirical PSFs. In this paper, we aim at improving the reconstruction accuracy beyond the Gaussian model, while preserving its computational efficiency. We introduce a new class of analog PSF models based on the Gaussian mixtures. The number of Gaussian kernels controls both the modeling accuracy and the computational efficiency of the model: the lower the number of kernels, the lower the accuracy and the higher the efficiency. To explore the accuracy-efficiency tradeoff, we propose a variational formulation of the PSF calibration problem, where a convex sparsity-inducing penalty on the number of Gaussian kernels allows trading accuracy for efficiency. We derive an efficient algorithm based on a fully split formulation of alternating split Bregman. We assess our framework on synthetic and real data, and demonstrate a better reconstruction accuracy in both geometry and photometry in point source localization-a fundamental inverse problem in fluorescence microscopy.",Visual Quality Assessment for Super-Resolved Images: Database and Method.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30762547,IEEE transactions on image processing : a publication of the IEEE Signal Processing Society,2019 05 29,"Image super-resolution (SR) has been an active research problem which has recently received renewed interest due to the introduction of new technologies such as deep learning. However, the lack of suitable criteria to evaluate the SR performance has hindered technology development. In this paper, we fill a gap in the literature by providing the first publicly available database as well as a new image quality assessment (IQA) method specifically designed for assessing the visual quality of super-resolved images (SRIs). In constructing the quality assessment database for SRIs (QADS), we carefully selected 20 reference images and created 980 SRIs using 21 image SR methods. Mean opinion score (MOS) for these SRIs is collected through 100 individuals participating in a suitably designed psychovisual experiment. Extensive numerical and statistical analysis is performed to show that the MOS of QADS has excellent suitability and reliability. The psychovisual experiment has led to the discovery that, unlike distortions encountered in other IQA databases, artifacts of the SRIs degenerate the image structure as well as the image texture. Moreover, the structural and textural degenerations have distinctive perceptual properties. Based on these insights, we propose a novel method to assess the visual quality of SRIs by separately considering the structural and textural components of images. Observing that textural degenerations are mainly attributed to dissimilar texture or checkerboard artifacts, we propose to measure the changes of textural distributions. We also observe that structural degenerations appear as blurring and jaggies artifacts in SRIs and develop separate similarity measures for different types of structural degenerations. A new pooling mechanism is then used to fuse the different similarities together to give the final quality score for an SRI. The experiments conducted on the QADS demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the classical as well as current state-of-the-art IQA methods.",Quadruplet Network With One-Shot Learning for Fast Visual Object Tracking.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30762546,IEEE transactions on image processing : a publication of the IEEE Signal Processing Society,2019 05 29,"In the same vein of discriminative one-shot learning, Siamese networks allow recognizing an object from a single exemplar with the same class label. However, they do not take advantage of the underlying structure of the data and the relationship among the multitude of samples as they only rely on the pairs of instances for training. In this paper, we propose a new quadruplet deep network to examine the potential connections among the training instances, aiming to achieve a more powerful representation. We design a shared network with four branches that receive a multi-tuple of instances as inputs and are connected by a novel loss function consisting of pair loss and triplet loss. According to the similarity metric, we select the most similar and the most dissimilar instances as the positive and negative inputs of triplet loss from each multi-tuple. We show that this scheme improves the training performance. Furthermore, we introduce a new weight layer to automatically select suitable combination weights, which will avoid the conflict between triplet and pair loss leading to worse performance. We evaluate our quadruplet framework by model-free tracking-by-detection of objects from a single initial exemplar in several visual object tracking benchmarks.

Acoustic transducers can passively detect broadband noise from inertial cavitation and the scattering of HIFU harmonics from stable cavitation bubbles. Conventional approaches to cavitation noise diagnostics typically involve computing the Fourier transform of the time-domain noise signal, applying a custom comb filter to isolate the frequency components of interest, followed by an inverse Fourier transform. We present an alternative technique based on singular value decomposition (SVD) that efficiently separates the broadband emissions and HIFU harmonics. Spatiotemporally resolved cavitation detection was achieved using a 128-element, 5-MHz linear-array ultrasound imaging system operating in the receive mode at 15 frames/s. A 1.1-MHz transducer delivered HIFU to tissue-mimicking phantoms and excised liver tissue for a duration of 5 s. Beamformed radio frequency signals corresponding to each scan line in a frame were assembled into a matrix, and SVD was performed. Spectra of the singular vectors obtained from a tissue-mimicking gel phantom were analyzed by computing the peak ratio ( R ), defined as the ratio of the peak of its fifth-order polynomial fit and the maximum spectral peak. Singular vectors that produced an were classified as those representing stable cavitation, i.e., predominantly containing harmonics of HIFU. The projection of data onto this singular base reproduced stable cavitation signals. Similarly, singular vectors that produced an were classified as those predominantly containing broadband noise associated with inertial cavitation. These singular vectors were used to isolate the inertial cavitation signal. The R -value thresholds determined using gel data were then employed to analyze cavitation data obtained from bovine liver ex vivo. The SVD-based method faithfully reproduced the structural details in the spatiotemporal cavitation maps produced using the more cumbersome comb-filter approach with a maximum root-mean-squared error of 10%."

Since there are significant temporal scale variations in the observed part of the ongoing action at different time steps, a novel window scale selection method is proposed to make our network focus on the performed part of the ongoing action and try to suppress the possible incoming interference from the previous actions at each step. An activation sharing scheme is also proposed to handle the overlapping computations among the adjacent time steps, which enables our framework to run more efficiently. Moreover, to enhance the performance of our framework for action prediction with the skeletal input data, a hierarchy of dilated tree convolutions are also designed to learn the multi-level structured semantic representations over the skeleton joints at each frame.

Min-entropy serves as a model to learn object locations and a metric to measure the randomness of object localization during learning. It aims to principally reduce the variance of learned instances and alleviate the ambiguity of detectors. MELM is decomposed into three components including proposal clique partition, object clique discovery, and object localization. MELM is optimized with a recurrent learning algorithm, which leverages continuation optimization to solve the challenging non-convexity problem. Experiments demonstrate that MELM significantly improves the performance of weakly supervised object detection, weakly supervised object localization, and image classification, against the state-of-the-art approaches.",Measuring Shapes with Desired Convex Polygons.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30762528,IEEE transactions on pattern analysis and machine intelligence,2019 03 15,"In this paper we have developed a family of shape measures. All the measures from the family evaluate the degree to which a shape looks like a predefined convex polygon. A quite new approach in designing object shape based measures has been applied. In the most cases such measures were defined by exploiting some of shape properties. An illustrative example might be the shape circularity measure derived by exploiting the well-know result that the circle has the largest area among all the shapes with the same perimeter. In the approach applied here, no desired property is needed and no optimizing shape has to be found. We start from a desired/selected convex polygon, and develop the related shape measure. The measures obtained range over the interval (0,1] and pick the maximal possible value, equal to 1, if and only if the measured shape coincides with the selected convex polygon, used to develop the a particular measure. All the measures are invariant with respect to translations, rotations, and scaling transformations. The method used has an straightforward extension to a wider family of shape measures, dependent on a tuning parameter involved. Another extension leads to a family of the new shape convexity measures.",Contact Forces Required to Record Monophasic Action Potentials: a Complement to Catheter Contact Force Measurement.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30762527,IEEE transactions on bio-medical engineering,2019 02 22,"The ability to monitor catheter contact force (CF) plays a major role in assessing radiofrequency ablation, impacting lesion size and arrhythmia recurrence, and dictating ablation duration and/or overall patient safety.

The inferences drawn from IHC-stained images depend to a great extent on the quality of immunostaining, which is in turn affected strongly by assay parameters. To optimize assay parameters, the available tissue sample is often limited. Moreover, with current practices in pathology, exploring the entire assay parameter space is not feasible. Thus, the evaluation of IHC stained slides is conventionally a subjective task, in which diagnoses are commonly drawn on images that are suboptimal. In this work, we introduce a framework to analyze IHC staining quality and its sensitivity to process parameters. To that extent, first histopathological sections are segmented automatically. Then, machine learning techniques are employed to extract disease-specific staining quality metrics (SQMs) targeting a quantitative assessment of staining quality. Lastly, an approach to efficiently analyze the parameter space is introduced to infer sensitivity to process parameters. We present results on microscale IHC tissue samples of five breast tumor classes, based on disease state and protein expression. A disease type classification F1-score of 0.82 and a contrast-level classification F1-score of 0.95 were achieved. With the proposed SQMs an area under the curve of 0.85 was achieved on average over different disease types. Our methodology provides a promising step in automatically evaluating and quantifying staining quality of IHC stained tissue sections, and it can potentially standardize immunostaining across diagnostic laboratories.",Evaluation of Submillimeter Diffusion Imaging of the Macaque Brain Using Readout-Segmented EPI at 7T.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30762524,IEEE transactions on bio-medical engineering,2019 02 14,The purpose of the present study was to achieve submillimeter-level diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of the macaque brain by using diffusion weighted (DW) readout-segmented echo planar imaging (rsEPI) with an optimized protocol at 7T MRI.,Numerical Study of Enhancement of Positive Dielectrophoresis Particle Trapping in Electrode-multilayered Microfluidic Device.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30762523,IEEE transactions on bio-medical engineering,2019 02 14,"Enhancement of positive dielectrophoresis (pDEP) particle trapping by a co-occurring fluid flow under an AC electric field in an electrode-multilayered microfluidic device is investigated by three-dimensional particle-fluid flow simulations. The particle motion near one cross-section of the microfluidic device is simulated under a zero flow condition by the Eulerian- Lagrangian method incorporating the AC electrothermal effect, thermal buoyancy and dielectrophoresis. The mean trapping rate under the steady state Rm is evaluated from the simulated number of trapped particles Ntrap for 54 cases with four parameters: electrode excitation pattern, medium conductivity σ, applied voltage ϕe and the real part of the Clausius-Mossotti factor Re[K(ω)]. The simulated pDEP velocity in the upper part of the flow channel is validated by an experiment using cell suspension and is fitted so that the non-dimensional velocity error is within 15 % of a typical velocity of pDEP. The mean trapping rate Rm is greatly increased by the fluid flow only in the high conductivity and high voltage cases. Regardless of the electrode excitation pattern, Rm increased almost proportionally to the inflow rate into the capture region where the pDEP force is effective. From a fitted equation of the results, the increase of Rm when Re[K(ω)] = 0.1 to 0.5 is found to be about 20 % to 30 % of the number of particles transported into the capture regions. The results quantify the enhancement of pDEP trapping by the fluid flow occurring under practical conditions in the device.",M/EEG-based Bio-markers to predict the Mild Cognitive Impairment and Alzheimer's disease: A Review from the Machine Learning Perspective.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30762522,IEEE transactions on bio-medical engineering,2019 02 14,"This work reviews the state-of-the-art neuromarkers development for the prognosis of Alzheimer's diseases (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The first part of this study is devoted to reviewing the recently-emerged machine learning (ML) algorithms based on electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) modalities. In particular, the methods are categorized by different types of neuromarkers. The second part of the review is dedicated to a series of investigations that further highlight the differences between these two modalities. Firstly, several source reconstruction methods are reviewed and their source-level performances explored, followed by an objective comparison between EEG and MEG from multiple perspectives. Finally, a number of the most recent reports on classification of MCI/AD during resting state using EEG/MEG are documented to show the up-to-date performance for this well-recognized data collecting scenario. It is noticed that the MEG modality may be particularly effective in distinguishing between subjects with MCI and healthy controls, a high classification accuracy of more than 98% was reported recently; whereas the EEG seems to be performing well in classifying AD and healthy subjects, which also reached around 98% of the accuracy. A number of influential factors have also been raised and suggested for careful considerations while evaluating the ML-based diagnosis systems in the real-world scenarios.","Negative reciprocity, not ordered assembly, underlies the interaction of Sox2 and Oct4 on DNA.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30762521,eLife,2019 02 22,"The mode of interaction of transcription factors (TFs) on eukaryotic genomes remains a matter of debate. Single-molecule data in living cells for the TFs Sox2 and Oct4 were previously interpreted as evidence of ordered assembly on DNA. However, the quantity that was calculated does not determine binding order but, rather, energy expenditure away from thermodynamic equilibrium. Here, we undertake a rigorous biophysical analysis which leads to the concept of reciprocity. The single-molecule data imply that Sox2 and Oct4 exhibit negative reciprocity, with expression of Sox2 increasing Oct4's genomic binding but expression of Oct4 decreasing Sox2's binding. Models show that negative reciprocity can arise either from energy expenditure or from a mixture of positive and negative cooperativity at distinct genomic loci. Both possibilities imply unexpected complexity in how TFs interact on DNA, for which single-molecule methods provide novel detection capabilities."

Our analyses illuminate two interlinked processes of knowledge construction: (a) developing evidentiary standards and (b) gathering evidence. In engaging these processes, participants sought two types of consistency: correspondence with external ""facts"" (e.g., medical information, cultural [mis]conceptions), and internal coherence (i.e., complaints were highly self-contradictory and unpredictable or were overly predictable). When initial inconsistencies made participants doubt their family member, participants gathered additional evidence, including experiential, behavioral, and interactional evidence, to test and revise their initial suspicions.

Although husbands' opposition is acknowledged as one of the factors impeding women's contraceptive use, little is known about how wives negotiate when their husbands oppose family planning. We addressed this research gap by conducting thematic analyses of qualitative data from 30 interviews of married couples. We employed thematic analysis to identify relevant themes from the transcribed data. The findings clearly demonstrate attitudes highlighting an imbalance in power relations and contraceptive decision-making within marital relationships. By initially complying with the husband's wish as a 'sign of honour', and then making further attempts at convincing him about family planning use, a woman can achieve her contraceptive target, or through the involvement of a third party. Wives are less empowered to overtly use contraceptives when their husbands oppose family planning. However, there are accepted justifications for covert use. The findings underscore the need to strengthen family planning interventions to enable behavioural change among Nigerian men, promote gender and reproductive health rights, and empower women with better negotiation skills.",Age-Related Patterns of DNA Detection and Specific IgG Subclasses in Healthy HHV-6- and HHV-7-Infected Individuals.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30762483,Viral immunology,2019 06 07,"Human herpesvirus 6A (HHV-6A), Human herpesvirus 6B (HHV-6B), and Human herpesvirus 7 (HHV-7) can persist by establishing a lifelong infection which could have implications on the immunocompetent host.

We have carried out a longitudinal study in seropositive healthy individuals for the detection of viral DNA in saliva and plasma samples, and for determining a specific IgG isotype immune response, which enabled the performance of these viruses to be observed over time. Furthermore, an elderly population was transversely studied to provide data of the activity of these viruses in the older population.

In dealing with resource scarcity, individuals' thoughts are narrowed to address immediate resource limitations, thus crowding out other information, a phenomenon called the scarcity mindset. To assess for indication of a scarcity mindset in sexual and reproductive decision making in rural Malawi, a setting with extreme resource scarcity, we collected qualitative data in the form of eight focus group discussions and 28 semi-structured, in-depth interviews with women and men of varying ages and marital status. Participants, who were of low socioeconomic status, described constant tradeoffs that they made to secure their daily needs. They articulated both the challenges of supporting many children and the need to bear many children to guarantee their own future support. While participants described wealthy people as being concerned with preserving resources (often through the practice of limiting childbearing), they described poor people as working to increase their probability of success against an uncertain economic future (without due consideration of contraceptive behaviours). We found qualitative evidence that a scarcity mindset may influence reproductive decision making among women and men in rural Malawi and may preclude the use of contraception in low-resource settings.",Increasing Child Serving Professionals' Awareness and Understanding of the Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30762481,Journal of child sexual abuse,2019 05 02,"Child serving professionals need increased understanding of the identification and therapeutic needs of child victims of commercial sexual exploitation.

Despite professional position or years of experience, participants had similar levels of CSEC knowledge before the training and all showed a significant improvement in their knowledge after the training. However, follow-up testing on a smaller subsample demonstrated that knowledge gains were not maintained. The analysis of the participants' responses to how their behavior would change subsequent to the training revealed important themes including: (1) greater ability to identify/assess or recognize CSEC victims, (2) greater understanding and knowledge of CSEC, (3) increased ability to communicate, interact, and engage with CSEC victims, and (4) heightened desire to educate others and raise awareness about CSEC. Results also indicated that participants were very satisfied with the training and found it highly relevant to their work.","HIV-positive Mozambican migrants in South Africa: loneliness, secrecy and disclosure.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30762480,"Culture, health & sexuality",2019 02 14,"South Africa continues to bear a heavy burden of HIV and a significant proportion of the nation's population consists of immigrants from other severely afflicted African nations.

Cognitive performance (working speed, reaction time, concentration performance, accuracy), workload and relevant covariates (salivary cortisol level, heart rate, physical activity, sitting time) were measured pre- and post-intervention under laboratory conditions. MANOVA and RMANOVA results did not show differences in performance parameters and workload, respectively, between sit/stand and traditional workplace users. Differences in text editing accuracy and cortisol levels for sit/stand workstation users indicate potential connectivity to cognitive parameters which should be further examined with large-scale studies.

This randomised controlled trial suggests that cognitive performance and workload are unaffected for sit/stand workstation users after 23 weeks of use. However, accuracy appeared to improve and physiological stress appeared to be altered.

We used our novel mouse model of experimental juvenile ischemic stroke (MCAO) to characterize age-specific cognitive dysfunction following ischemia. Juvenile and adult mice subjected to 45-min MCAO, and extracellular field recordings of CA1 neurons were performed to assess hippocampal synaptic plasticity changes after MCAO, and contextual fear conditioning was performed to evaluate memory and biochemistry used to analyze Nogo-A expression. Juvenile mice showed impaired synaptic plasticity seven days after MCAO, followed by full recovery by 30 days. Memory behavior was consistent with synaptic impairments and recovery after juvenile MCAO. Nogo-A expression increased in ipsilateral hippocampus seven days after MCAO compared to contralateral and sham hippocampus. Further, inhibition of Nogo-A receptors reversed MCAO-induced synaptic impairment in slices obtained seven days after juvenile MCAO. Adult MCAO-induced impairment of LTP was not associated with increased Nogo-A. This study demonstrates that stroke causes functional impairment in the hippocampus and recovery of behavioral and synaptic function is more robust in the young brain. Nogo-A receptor activity may account for the impairments seen following juvenile ischemic injury.","Hard, soft and off-the-shelf foot orthoses and their effect on the angle of the medial longitudinal arch: A biplane fluoroscopy study.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30762477,Prosthetics and orthotics international,2019 06 07,"Foot orthoses have proven to be effective for conservative management of various pathologies.

In addition, 93 nasal swabs were collected from patients receiving hemodialysis, after obtaining consent and screening for MRSA colonization. sasX polymerase chain reaction and sequencing were carried out for all isolates. Multilocus sequence typing was performed for all sasX-positive isolates. Of the tested clinical MRSA isolates, 11% (n = 48) were positive for sasX gene. Among hemodialysis patients, 26% (n = 24) were characterized as MRSA carriers. However, all MRSA strains isolated from nasal swab were negative for sasX gene. Overall, we observed 10% (11% in clinical MRSA isolates and 0% in MRSA carriers) of sasX-positive MRSA in this study. ST239 and ST368 were the predominant sasX carrying MRSA lineages. The majority of sasX carrying MRSA strains were characterized as Staphylococcus epidermidis surface protein I (sesI; 71%), a sasX homolog native to S. epidermidis. This study highlights the dissemination of sasX/sesI to ST368 (CC8), ST3324 (CC8), ST772 (CC1), and ST22 (CC22).

Twelve rural-dwelling participants were interviewed up to 3 times to understand the processes involved in defining and pursuing well-being. From this exploration, we suggest that well-being is not a set state to be achieved and then enjoyed, rather well-being results from establishing and maintaining membership in the rural community. Membership facilitated access to the array of material and psychological supports needed for a sense of well-being. Findings support the assumption that urban models of care are insufficient for rural areas.

In this study, we aimed to investigate the dynamic relationship between the yearly detection frequency of LREF clinical isolates and yearly consumption of LZD and vancomycin (VCM) over a 5-year period in a Chinese hospital setting. Antibiotic consumption data (LZD and VCM) from 2011 to 2015 were obtained from a computerized database and recalculated as the defined daily doses (DDDs) per 100 bed-days (DBD). All 268 E. faecalis clinical isolates were retrospectively collected from 2011 to 2015 in this hospital. LZD resistance mechanism and multilocus sequence typing of E. faecalis were determined by PCR.

Furthermore, the detection frequency of optrA-positive E. faecalis also correlated positively with high LZD consumption load in this hospital setting. Conclusively, high LZD consumption load facilitates the development of LZD resistance and promotes the selection of optrA-positive E. faecalis clinical isolates under antibiotic pressure in a hospital setting.",Comparison of Palliative Care Interventions for Cancer versus Heart Failure Patients: A Secondary Analysis of a Systematic Review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30762462,Journal of palliative medicine,2019 04 11,"In 2016, Kavalieratos and colleagues performed a systematic review of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of palliative care (PC) interventions.

Gun attitudes are a potential risk factor for gun violence; however, factors related to gun attitudes have not been identified. Mental illness such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is commonly discussed as a key factor in gun violence, despite research lacking in this area, and it is unknown whether symptoms of PTSD and probable PTSD are associated with more positive attitudes toward guns. The aim of the current study was to investigate the relations between PTSD symptoms and gun attitudes among 265 undergraduate students who experienced at least one interpersonal traumatic event ( Mage = 24.69 years, SD = 7.15 years, 75.6% female, 61.1% White). Path analysis revealed that individuals with PTSD symptoms above clinical cutoff were not more likely to have more positive gun attitudes. However, the PTSD symptom clusters evinced distinct relations with gun attitudes. Intrusion and avoidance symptoms were related to gun beliefs regarding protection, with intrusion symptoms being linked to a stronger belief that guns provide protection from crime and victimization (β = .23), whereas avoidance symptoms were inversely associated with this belief (β = -.22). Interestingly, neither trauma related in feelings and thoughts nor arousal and reactivity corresponded with gun attitudes. Certain PTSD symptom clusters may be relevant in understanding gun beliefs, with specific symptoms exhibiting distinct ties to gun attitudes.",Analysis on outcomes of facial paralysis complicated by middle ear cholesteatoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30762460,Acta oto-laryngologica,2019 03 19,The prognostic factors of facial paralysis complicated by middle ear cholesteatoma (MEC) are largely unknown due to limited reports and smaller sample size.,"High annual surgeon volume reduces the risk of adverse events following primary total hip arthroplasty: a registry-based study of 12,100 cases in Western Sweden.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30762459,Acta orthopaedica,2019 04 21,"Background and purpose - Most earlier publications investigating whether annual surgeon volume is associated with lower levels of adverse events (AE), reoperations, and mortality are based on patient cohorts from North America. There is also a lack of adjustment for important confounders in these studies. Therefore, we investigated whether higher annual surgeon volume is associated with a lower risk of adverse events and mortality within 90 days following primary total hip arthroplasty (THA). Patients and methods - We collected information on primary total hip arthroplasties (THA) performed between 2007 and 2016 from 10 hospitals in Western Sweden. These data were linked with the Swedish Hip Arthroplasty Register and a regional patient register. We used logistic regression (simple and multiple) adjusted for age, sex, comorbidities, BMI, fiation technique, diagnosis, surgical approach, time in practice as orthopedic specialist and annual volume. Annual surgeon volume was calculated as the number of primary THAs the operating surgeon had performed 365 days prior to the index THA. Results - 12,100 primary THAs, performed due to both primary and secondary osteoarthritis by 268 different surgeons, were identified. The median annual surgeon volume was 23 primary THAs (range 0-82) 365 days prior to the THA of interest and the mean risk of AE within 90 days was 7%. If the annual volume increased by 10 primary THAs in the simple logistic regression the risk of AE decreased by 10% and in the adjusted multiple regression the corresponding number was 8%. The mortality rate in the study was low (0.2%) and we could not find any association between 90-day mortality and annual surgeon volume. Interpretation - High annual surgical activity is associated with a reduced risk of adverse events within 90 days. Based on these findings healthcare providers should consider planning for increased surgeon volume.",Laparoscopic versus lichtenstein hernioplasty for inguinal hernias: a systematic review and Meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30762458,Minimally invasive therapy & allied technologies : MITAT : official journal of the Society for Minimally Invasive Therapy,2019 02 14,This meta-analysis aimed to explore the safety and efficacy of Lichtenstein versus laparoscopic hernioplasty for inguinal hernias based on eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs).,Analysis between phenotypes and genotypes of inner ear malformation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30762457,Acta oto-laryngologica,2019 05 06,"The clinical characteristics of LVAS have attracted more and more attention, its audiology and imaging features have also been deeply studied.",Development of vestibular ocular reflex and gross motor function in infants with common cavity deformity as a type of inner ear malformation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30762456,Acta oto-laryngologica,2019 05 08,Background： The function of common cavity deformity demonstrated by temporal bone CT and MRI has been unknown.,"Identification of causative variants in patients with non-syndromic hearing loss in the Minnan region, China by targeted next-generation sequencing.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30762455,Acta oto-laryngologica,2019 05 06,"Due to extreme genetic heterogeneity, targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) can be an efficient tool for rapid genetic diagnosis of hereditary non-syndromic hearing loss (NSHL)."

Genetic gain to improve production traits of domestic animal populations is most effectively achieved via selective use of gametes from animals deemed to be elite, and this principle has been the basis of selective breeding strategies employed by humans for thousands of years. In modern-day animal agriculture, artificial insemination (AI) has been the staple of selective breeding programs, but it has inherent limitations for applications in beef cattle and pig production systems. In this review, we discuss the potential and current state of development for a concept termed Surrogate Sires as a next-generation breeding tool in livestock production. The scheme capitalizes on the capacity of spermatogonial stem cells to regenerate sperm production after isolation from donor testicular tissue and transfer into the testes of a recipient male that lacks endogenous germline, thereby allowing the surrogate male to produce offspring with the donor haplotype via natural mating. This concept provides an effective selective breeding tool to achieve genetic gain that is conducive for livestock production systems in which AI is difficult to implement.",High rates of depression anxiety and suicidal ideation among inpatients in general hospital in China.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30762438,International journal of psychiatry in clinical practice,2019 06 03,"Objective: To investigate the prevalence rates of depression anxiety and suicidal ideation among Chinese general hospital inpatients and to identify the potential associations with sociodemographics. Method: A cross-sectional survey was applied in a Chinese general hospital. A questionnaire set, including sociodemographic variables, Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7 (GAD-7), was completed by the participants. Clinically significant depression (CSD) and clinically significant anxiety (CSA) were defined as a score above 10 on the two scales. CSD and CSA are proxy measures but not specific diagnoses of mental disorders. Results: Data from 1329 patients were included in the final analysis. 422 (31.8%) reported clinically significant depressive symptoms, 83 (6.3%) reported frequent suicidal ideation, and 204 (15.3%) reported clinically significant anxiety. Household income was negatively associated with CSD. Inpatients with lower household incomes and educational levels had higher rates of CSA. Middle-aged inpatients were more prone to suicidal ideation, and stable marital status was related to less suicidal ideation. Conclusion: Depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation were determined to be common psychological problems in Chinese inpatients. Chinese medical personnel must pay attention to the mental health conditions of inpatients, particularly inpatients with lower income, educational levels, and poor marital status. Key Points This is one of the first studies focusing on the prevalence of depression and anxiety in Chinese hospitalized inpatients in non-psychiatric departments of a general hospital. The PHQ-9 and GAD-7 were determined to be potential screening tools to aid Chinese medical workers in recognizing depression and anxiety in nonpsychiatric departments. The prevalence of depression, anxiety and suicidal ideation was observed to be relatively high in inpatients, which requires more attention from Chinese clinicians.",Impact of Human Factors Testing on Medical Device Design: Validation of an Automated CGM Sensor Applicator.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30762437,Journal of diabetes science and technology,2019 02 14,"Improving user engagement with continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) is considered a major requirement for achieving optimal treatment efficacy.

Overlapping target genes predicted by TargetScan, miRTarBase, and miRDB online analysis tools were chosen for Gene Ontology (GO) classification and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis. Furthermore, the prognostic value of each miRNA was assessed using Kaplan-Meier curves. Nineteen differentially expressed miRNAs were identified, including 14 upregulated and 5 downregulated miRNAs, in recurrent cervical cancer. One hundred and sixteen target genes were predicted by the three prediction tools. GO analysis showed 19 significant categories, including ""metal ion binding,"" ""vasculogenesis,"" and ""cytosol component."" KEGG analysis identified 54 significant biological pathways, such as ""proteoglycans in cancer signaling pathway"" and ""HTLV-I infection signaling pathway.""

Human perception and performance,2019 03 28,"Substantial research across Indo-European languages suggests that readers display a degree of uncertainty in letter position coding. For example, readers perceive transposed-letter stimuli, such as jugde, as similar to their base words (e.g., judge). However, tolerance to disruptions of letter order is not apparent in all languages, suggesting that critical aspects of the writing system may shape the nature of position coding. We investigated readers' tolerance to these disruptions in Korean, a writing system characterized by a high degree of orthographic confusability. Results of three Korean masked priming experiments revealed robust identity priming effects, but no indication of priming due to shared letters or syllables in different positions. Two further masked priming experiments revealed where the Korean findings deviate from English. These results support the claim that the nature of the writing system influences the precision of orthographic representations used in reading.

This research sheds light on the apparent paradox by proposing that the perceived morality of conspicuous consumption is malleable, contingent upon how different moral lenses highlight the different characteristics embedded in the behavior. Utilizing the Moral Foundations Theory, we demonstrate that the individualizing values (i.e., equality and welfare) make people focus on the self-enhancing characteristics of conspicuous consumption, making it seem morally objectionable. However, the binding values (i.e., deference to authority, in-group loyalty, and purity) make people focus on the social identity signaling characteristic of conspicuous consumption, making it seem morally permissible. First, an archival dataset shows that the prevalence of the different moral values predicts per-capita spending on luxury goods across different countries. Then, 6 studies (N = 2903) show that the trait endorsement and the momentary salience of the different moral foundations can influence the moral judgment of conspicuous consumption as well as the propensity to engage in conspicuous consumption. Further, analyses show that the effect of the binding values (individualizing values) is mediated by heightened sensitivity to the social identity signaling (self-enhancing) aspects of conspicuous consumption. Finally, the studies demonstrate that the effect is moderated by the extent of social visibility during consumption. Thus, this research suggests that some moral values can, somewhat paradoxically, increase conspicuous consumption.

Recent U.S. Supreme Court cases concerning the legal status of juveniles have consulted psychological science to decide where to draw these boundaries. However, little is known about the robustness of the relevant research, because it has been conducted largely in the U.S. and other Western countries. To the extent that lawmakers look to research to guide their decisions, it is important to know how generalizable the scientific conclusions are. The present study examines 2 psychological phenomena relevant to legal questions about adolescent maturity: cognitive capacity, which undergirds logical thinking, and psychosocial maturity, which comprises individuals' ability to restrain themselves in the face of emotional, exciting, or risky stimuli. Age patterns of these constructs were assessed in 5,227 individuals (50.7% female), ages 10-30 (M = 17.05, SD = 5.91) from 11 countries. Importantly, whereas cognitive capacity reached adult levels around age 16, psychosocial maturity reached adult levels beyond age 18, creating a ""maturity gap"" between cognitive and psychosocial development. Juveniles may be capable of deliberative decision making by age 16, but even young adults may demonstrate ""immature"" decision making in arousing situations. We argue it is therefore reasonable to have different age boundaries for different legal purposes: 1 for matters in which cognitive capacity predominates, and a later 1 for matters in which psychosocial maturity plays a substantial role.

Evidence from a fully randomized field experiment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30762416,Law and human behavior,2019 03 28,"In partnership with a small city police department, we randomly informed or did not inform 122 crime suspects that their interrogations were being video-recorded. Coding of all sessions indicated that camera-informed suspects spoke as often and as much as did those who were not informed; they were as likely to waive Miranda at the outset and later; they were as likely to make admissions and confessions, not just denials; and they were perceived no differently by detectives on a range of dimensions. Looking at distal outcomes, we observed no differences in ultimate case dispositions. In terms of policy and practice, results did not support the hypothesis that recording-even when transparent, as required in 2-party consent states-inhibits suspects or alters case dispositions. At least for now, this conclusion is empirically limited to situations in which cameras are concealed and to interrogations that do not involve juveniles, homicides, or drug crimes, which we a priori excluded from our sample.

What is unknown is what predicts sibling bullying roles (uninvolved, victim, bully-victim and bully). This study aimed to identify precursors of sibling bullying roles in middle childhood using a large sample of 6,838 children from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, a prospective United Kingdom birth-cohort. The relative associations of four sets of precursors: (a) structural family characteristics, (b) parent and parenting characteristics, (c) early social experiences, and (d) child individual differences was assessed before 8 years of age. Structural family characteristics (being the firstborn and having older brothers) and sex (being male) were the strongest predictors of sibling bullying, consistent with an evolutionary model of sibling aggression. Parenting variables, early social experiences, and child individual differences made significant but smaller contributions. These findings may help to identify at-risk families, allowing for appropriate interventions to be implemented from birth.

Factors included birth weight, gestational age, parental age at birth, number of older brothers and sisters, breastfeeding, maternal anxiety/depression, family socioeconomic position, parent-child relationships, parental absences, pubertal body mass index, and housing issues. We used data on 5,007 youth from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC). Sexual orientation was assessed using a 5-point scale of sexual attraction at 15.5 years. Early life factors were separated into three developmental periods: prenatal (n = 9), before 7 years (n = 5), and after 7 years (n = 5). We controlled for childhood gender nonconformity, handedness, and digit ratio as markers of prenatal androgen exposure. Gender nonconformity was strongly associated with later male and female nonheterosexuality, and higher right-hand digit ratio was associated with later male nonheterosexuality. Boys with low birth weight and shorter breastfeeding duration were more likely to have a later nonheterosexual orientation. Boys with parental absence before 7 years of age were more likely to be nonheterosexual, but this effect disappeared after entering all early life history factors. Parental absence since birth, low prenatal family socioeconomic position, and poorer parent-child relationship were associated with later nonheterosexuality among girls. The results are discussed in the context of a life history framework for understanding human sexual orientation development in males and females.

We aimed to determine if ever-deployed (i.e., having a history of at least one deployment) and never-deployed United States Army Reserve and National Guard (USAR/NG) soldiers differed in mental health, substance use, and resiliency factors, and to determine the relative influence of deployment status and each of these factors on poor psychosocial outcomes. We analyzed a subset of data from Operation: SAFETY (Soldiers and Families Excelling Through the Years) (N = 404), an ongoing study examining the health and well-being of USAR/NG soldiers. Bivariate analyses demonstrated that soldiers did not significantly differ across a range of measures on the basis of deployment status (ps > 0.05). In fact, Factor Analyses and Discriminant Function Analysis revealed that deployment status was the least salient factor to psychosocial problems among the measured variables and that the observed variables could not accurately discriminate between ever-deployed and never-deployed soldiers, F(8, 374) = 1.34, p > .05. Measures of mental health and substance use were more salient to psychosocial problems (ps < .05). Measures of resiliency loaded negatively onto psychosocial problems (ps < .05), indicating that they contribute to better well-being. Targeting screening and intervention efforts only on soldiers who have been deployed will miss opportunities to intervene on an equally affected group. Resiliency factors should be considered as intervention targets.

To advance understanding of how maternal sleep is linked with both mothers' experiences of stress and their parenting, this study used actigraphic and mother-report measures of sleep, observed and mother reports of parenting, and measures of multiple stressors of relevance. In a community sample of mothers of toddlers (N = 314; child age M = 2.60, SD = 0.07 years), maternal stress was indexed with a cumulative risk score that combined sociodemographic risks and common parent stressors, including household chaos, role overload, parenting hassles, child misbehavior, negative life events, and lack of social support. We found that mothers who experienced shorter, later, and more variable sleep experienced higher levels of stress as indexed by the cumulative risk index. In addition, those with higher stress required longer to fall asleep and perceived more sleep problems. We also found that actigraphic measures of poor and insufficient maternal sleep were associated with less observed positive parenting, even when controlling for the cumulative risk index and maternal age, employment, and family size. Mothers who required longer to fall asleep also reported more dysfunctional parenting, with the same statistical controls. The findings, coupled with research showing that sleep is amenable to intervention, suggest that parental sleep may ultimately prove to be a useful intervention target for promoting positive parent involvement and responsiveness.

This cross-sectional study aimed to explore the intrapersonal and interpersonal effects of mothers' and fathers' anxiety and depressive symptoms on their own and their partners' antenatal attachment to the fetus. Additionally, it aimed to explore the mediating role of dyadic adjustment on these associations. Participants, 320 pregnant women and their partners, completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the Dyadic Adjustment Scale, and the Maternal and Paternal Antenatal Attachment Scale. Data were analyzed using the actor-partner interdependence mediation model. Mothers' (ß = -.16, p < .01) and fathers' depressive symptoms (ß = -.38, p < .001) were associated with their levels of antenatal attachment to the fetus. These relationships, however, were mediated by levels of dyadic adjustment (ß = -.08, p < .05; ß = -.09, p < .05, respectively). Fathers' anxiety symptoms were associated with their levels of antenatal attachment to the fetus (ß = .16, p < .05). This relationship was partially mediated by their levels of dyadic adjustment (ß = -.05, p < .05). Finally, fathers' depressive symptoms were associated with mothers' levels of antenatal attachment to the fetus through the mothers' dyadic adjustment levels (ß = -.06, p < .05). Results indicated that anxiety and depressive symptoms as well as lower levels of dyadic adjustment during pregnancy seem to negatively impact the levels of antenatal attachment to the fetus, especially for fathers.

Since then, there has been significant growth in research and theory regarding multicultural contexts. The revised Multicultural Guidelines are conceptualized to reconsider diversity and multicultural practice within professional psychology at this period in time, with intersectionality as its primary purview. Psychologists are encouraged to incorporate developmental and contextual antecedents of identity and consider how they can be acknowledged, addressed, and embraced to generate more effective models of professional engagement. The Multicultural Guidelines incorporate broad reference group identities that acknowledge within-group differences and the role of self-definition. Identity is shaped across contexts and time by cultural influences including age, generation, gender, gender identity, ethnicity, race, religion, spirituality, language, sexual orientation, social class, education, employment, ability status, national origin, immigration status, and historical as well as ongoing experiences of marginalization.

Our responses take varying forms too, ranging from chronic distress to resilience. Although this pronounced variability is widely recognized, one possible outcome of acute adversity has been invariably, though understandably, ignored: an improvement in psychological and social functioning. In this analysis, I argue that, under some conditions, people can experience marked psychological improvement after acute adversity. I describe this response pattern as psychosocial gains from adversity (PGA) and define it as favorable and reliable change on an index of psychological functioning from before to after exposure to adversity. In the present article, first I distinguish PGA from traditional perspectives on growth after adversity on the basis of key conceptual differences. I then review empirical evidence for PGA as a replicable response pattern following different forms of adversity, including bereavement, military deployment, and mass trauma. I propose a multilevel theoretical model for PGA that focuses on automatic prosocial affiliative behaviors and group-level contextual factors that are conditioned by acute adversity. I describe moderators and boundary conditions at different levels of analysis that will enhance or detract from the likelihood of PGA. I conclude with the implications of PGA for theory and empirical research on postadversity outcomes and outline a research agenda to better understand it.

B,2019 03 14,"Helical hinges are common in transmembrane (TM) proteins. Hinging motions of TM helices are associated with the functional dynamics of many important membrane proteins such as various G-protein-coupled receptors and potassium channels. Although coarse-grained (CG) simulations are useful for studying membrane proteins, they are limited in describing accurately the hinge-related protein dynamics. In this study, we have overcome this limitation through a further development of the MARTINI CG model. The key improvement lies in implementation of additional local structural types and parameterization of the model against a structural library of TM helices obtained from the Protein Data Bank. Through simulations of 12 membrane proteins, we have demonstrated that the improved model not only accurately describes the local hinge structures of these proteins but also reproduces the overall structures of TM domains better than the original MARTINI is able to do. Furthermore, we show that the improved model, when combined with an elastic network, can now be used to explore the deactivation of the human β2 adrenergic receptor and the gating motions of the KcsA potassium channel. The important details of these hinge-associated transitions captured in our simulations agree well with previous experiments and all-atom simulations, and it was concluded that the improved model shows promise as a useful tool for the study of functional dynamics of membrane proteins.","C3N5: A Low Bandgap Semiconductor Containing an Azo-Linked Carbon Nitride Framework for Photocatalytic, Photovoltaic and Adsorbent Applications.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30762369,Journal of the American Chemical Society,2019 04 03,"Modification of carbon nitride based polymeric 2D materials for tailoring their optical, electronic and chemical properties for various applications has gained significant interest. The present report demonstrates the synthesis of a novel modified carbon nitride framework with a remarkable 3:5 C:N stoichiometry (C3N5) and an electronic bandgap of 1.76 eV, by thermal deammoniation of the melem hydrazine precursor. Characterization revealed that in the C3N5 polymer, two s-heptazine units are bridged together with azo linkage, which constitutes an entirely new and different bonding fashion from g-C3N4 where three heptazine units are linked together with tertiary nitrogen. Extended conjugation due to overlap of azo nitrogens and increased electron density on heptazine nucleus due to the aromatic π network of heptazine units lead to an upward shift of the valence band maximum resulting in bandgap reduction down to 1.76 eV. XRD, He-ion imaging, HR-TEM, EELS, PL, fluorescence lifetime imaging, Raman, FTIR, TGA, KPFM, XPS, NMR and EPR clearly show that the properties of C3N5 are distinct from pristine carbon nitride (g-C3N4). When used as an electron transport layer (ETL) in MAPbBr3 based halide perovskite solar cells, C3N5 outperformed g-C3N4, in particular generating an open circuit photovoltage as high as 1.3 V, while C3N5 blended with MA xFA1- xPb(I0.85Br0.15)3 perovskite active layer achieved a photoconversion efficiency (PCE) up to 16.7%. C3N5 was also shown to be an effective visible light sensitizer for TiO2 photoanodes in photoelectrochemical water splitting. Because of its electron-rich character, the C3N5 material displayed instantaneous adsorption of methylene blue from aqueous solution reaching complete equilibrium within 10 min, which is significantly faster than pristine g-C3N4 and other carbon based materials. C3N5 coupled with plasmonic silver nanocubes promotes plasmon-exciton coinduced surface catalytic reactions reaching completion at much low laser intensity (1.0 mW) than g-C3N4, which showed sluggish performance even at high laser power (10.0 mW). The relatively narrow bandgap and 2D structure of C3N5 make it an interesting air-stable and temperature-resistant semiconductor for optoelectronic applications while its electron-rich character and intrasheet cavity make it an attractive supramolecular adsorbent for environmental applications.",Protonation of the Biliverdin IXα Chromophore in the Red and Far-Red Photoactive States of a Bacteriophytochrome.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30762368,The journal of physical chemistry.

B,2019 03 07,"The nature of functionalization of alkyl chains of imidazolium-based surface active ionic liquids (SAILs) with amide or ester moiety led to contrasting complexation behavior toward the globular protein, bovine serum albumin. This prompted us to further investigate the SAIL-dependent colloidal behavior of another globular protein, β-lactoglobulin (βLG), to probe the origin of varying structural transformations in globular proteins induced by SAILs. Herein, we investigated the colloidal systems of βLG, rich in β-sheet structure, in the presence of four structurally different SAILs using a multitechnique approach. The complexation behavior, both at the air-solution interface and in bulk, is supplemented by different techniques. Docking studies have complemented the obtained experimental results. The specificity of structure, H-bonding ability of SAILs, and inherent structure of protein are found to govern their complexation behavior in terms of size, shape, and polarity of protein-SAIL complexes along with varying degrees of structural alterations in globular proteins. The present work is expected to be very useful in establishing a deep understanding of the structure-property relationship between the nature of proteins and SAILs for their complexation and colloidal behavior for various biomedical applications.",Dynamic Surface Properties of Fullerenol Solutions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30762366,Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids,2019 03 12,"Application of dilational surface rheology, surface tensiometry, ellipsometry, Brewster angle, and transmission electron and atomic force microscopies allowed the estimation of the structure of the adsorption layer of a fullerenol with a large number of hydroxyl groups, C60(OH) X ( X = 30 ± 2). The surface properties of fullerenol solutions proved to be similar to the properties of dispersions of solid nanoparticles and differ from those of the solutions of conventional surfactants and amphiphilic macromolecules. Although the surface activity of fullerenol is not high, it forms adsorption layers of high surface elasticity up to 170 mN/m. The layer consists of small interconnected surface aggregates with the thickness corresponding to two-three layers of fullerenol molecules. The aggregates are not adsorbed from the bulk phase but formed at the interface. The adsorption kinetics is controlled by an electrostatic adsorption barrier at the interface.","Oxidatively Induced Reductive Elimination: Exploring the Scope and Catalyst Systems with Ir, Rh, and Ru Complexes.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30762365,Journal of the American Chemical Society,2019 03 06,"Direct conversion of C-H bonds into C-C bonds is a promising alternative to the conventional cross-coupling reactions, thus giving rise to a wide range of efficient catalytic C-H functionalization reactions. Among the elementary stages in the catalytic C-C bond formation, reductive elimination constitutes a key step of the catalytic cycle, and, therefore, extensive studies have been made to facilitate this process. In this regard, oxidation on the metal center of a post-transmetalation intermediate would be an appealing approach. Herein, we have explored the substrate scope, catalyst systems, and oxidation tools to prove that the oxidatively induced reductive elimination ( ORE) plays a critical role in the product-releasing C-C bond formation. Notably, we have demonstrated that ORE broadly operates with a series of half-sandwich d6 Ir(III)-, Rh(III)-, and Ru(II)-aryl complexes. We have described that the metal center oxidation of the isolable post-transmetalation intermediates by means of chemical- or electro-oxidation can readily deliver the desired arylated products upon reductive elimination even at ambient temperature. Computational studies delineated the thermodynamics of the reductive elimination, where the activation barriers are shown to be significantly reduced upon increasing the oxidation states of the intermediates. We were also successful in corroborating this ORE in the corresponding Rh- methyl complex. In addition, catalytic conditions were optimized to incorporate this mechanistic understanding into the Ir-, Rh-, and Ru-catalyzed C-C bond formations under mild conditions."

Our results suggest that this RbBa R(BO3)2 ( R = Gd-Yb) family may be of further interest both experimentally and theoretically as highly geometrically frustrated magnets.",Evolution of the Interfacial Structure of a Catalyst Ink with the Quality of the Dispersing Solvent: A Contrast Variation Small-Angle and Ultrasmall-Angle Neutron Scattering Investigation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30762351,ACS applied materials & interfaces,2019 03 18,"The electrocatalyst layer (ECL) of the proton-exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) is commonly fabricated from colloidal catalyst ink containing carbon-supported catalyst nanoparticles (NPs), ionomer stabilizer, and dispersion medium (DM). The structure, stability, and aggregate size distribution of fuel cell catalyst ink are critically dependent on the quality of DM. However, understanding of the influence of the quality of DM on the hierarchical structure of the ECL is lacking. This work presents a systematic investigation of the effects of reducing alcohol content in isopropyl alcohol/water (IPA/H2O) binary mixtures as DM on the structural evolution of water-rich (green) catalyst ink using contrast-variation small-angle and ultrasmall-angle neutron scattering techniques. Both qualitative and quantitative information are extracted from the data to obtain information about the size, structure, and organization of the catalyst ink using different model functions fit to the experimental data. The catalyst ink prepared using 70% IPA (commonly employed in industry and extensively reported in the literature) is shown to consist of randomly distributed globular carbon aggregates (mean radius of gyration of ∼178.9 nm) stabilized by an ionomer mass fractal shell (thickness of ∼13.0 nm), which is dispersed in the matrix of rodlike (∼1.3 nm radius and ∼35.0 nm length) negatively surface-charged ionomer NPs. These well characterized baseline data are then compared and contrasted with DM formulations of lower IPA content. A sequential reduction in IPA content of DM shows a progressive increase in the ionomer NP radius and electrostatic repulsion, concomitantly with the decrease in the carbon aggregate size and ionomer shell thickness of the catalyst ink. Therefore, the changes in the interfacial structure via adjustments of the DM composition can be used as a controlling parameter to tailor the hierarchical structure of the colloidal fuel cell catalyst ink and to further optimize the performance of the ECL.",A Study of MnO2 with Different Crystalline Forms for Pseudocapacitive Desalination.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30762350,ACS applied materials & interfaces,2019 04 15,"Recent research on materials for capacitive deionization (CDI) has shown that intercalation materials have salt removal capacities (>40 mg g-1) much higher than those of carbon materials (∼15 mg g-1). However, little work has been done to elucidate the relationship between the microstructure of an intercalation material and its desalination performance. Herein, we report the desalination performances of various crystalline forms of MnO2 in a hybrid CDI setup without the use of ion-exchange membranes. MnO2 materials used in our experiments were either poorly crystalline or crystalline forms of 1D hollandite α-MnO2, 2D birnessite δ-MnO2, and 3D spinel λ-MnO2. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy performed on electrochemically cycled MnO2 showed redox changes associated with intercalation processes in crystalline MnO2, whereas poorly crystalline MnO2 showed no such changes. It was further shown that surface adsorption is dominant in poorly crystalline MnO2 and that poorly crystalline forms of α-MnO2 and δ-MnO2 exhibited the highest salt removal capacities of 0.17 and 0.16 mmol g-1 (9.93 and 9.35 mg g-1), respectively. These performances are comparable to state-of-the-art carbon materials and are remarkable considering the low surface areas (<400 m2 g-1) of MnO2 materials.",Cell Permeable Imidazole-Desferrioxamine Conjugates: Synthesis and In Vitro Evaluation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30762349,Bioconjugate chemistry,2019 03 20,"Desferrioxamine (DFO), a clinically approved iron chelator used for iron overload, is unable to chelate labile plasma iron (LPI) because of its limited cell permeability. Herein, alkyl chain modified imidazolium cations with varied hydrophobicities have been conjugated with DFO. The iron binding abilities and the antioxidant properties of the conjugates were found to be similar to DFO. The degree of cellular internalization was much higher in the octyl-imidazolium-DFO conjugate (IV) compared with DFO, and IV was able to chelate LPI in vitro.

Ba3CrN3H crystallizes in the hexagonal space group P63/ m (Nr 176), with the lattice parameters a = 8.0270(2) Å, c = 5.6240(1) Å, and Z = 2. The structure comprises [CrN3]5- trigonal planar units and [HBa6]11+ octahedral units. The presence of anionic hydrogen in the structure has been verified by 1H NMR experiments. DFT calculations show that the addition of hydrogen increases the stability of the phase versus Ba3CrN3. The two d-electrons of Cr4+ are located in the nonbonding d z2 orbital, rendering Ba3CrN3H nonmagnetic and insulating.",Hydrodynamic versus Surface Interaction Impacts of Roughness in Closing the Gap between Favorable and Unfavorable Colloid Transport Conditions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30762346,Environmental science & technology,2019 03 05,"Recent experiments revealed that roughness decreases the gap in colloid attachment between favorable (repulsion absent) and unfavorable (repulsion present) conditions through a combination of hydrodynamic slip and surface interactions with asperities. Hydrodynamic slip was calibrated to experimentally observed tangential colloid velocities, demonstrating that slip length was equal to maximum asperity relief, thereby providing a functional relationship between slip and roughness metrics. Incorporation of the slip length in mechanistic particle trajectory simulations yielded the observed modest decrease in attachment over rough surfaces under favorable conditions, with the observed decreased attachment being due to reduced colloid delivery rather than decreased attraction. Cumulative interactions with multiple asperities acting within the zone of colloid-surface interaction were unable to produce the observed dramatic increased attachment and decreased reversibility with increased roughness under unfavorable conditions, necessitating inclusion of nanoscale attractive heterogeneity that was inferred to have codeveloped with roughness. Simulated attachment matched experimental observations when the spatial frequency of larger heterodomains (nanoscale zones of attraction) increased disproportionately relative to smaller heterodomains as roughness increased, whereas attachment was insensitive to asperity properties, including the number of interactions per asperity and asperity height; colloid detachment simulations were highly sensitive to these parameters. These cumulative findings reveal that hydrodynamic slip moderately decreases colloid bulk delivery, nanoscale heterogeneity dramatically enhances colloid attachment, and multiple interactions among asperities decrease detachment from rough surfaces.",Chemical Characterization of Aerosol Particles Using On-Chip Photonic Cavity Enhanced Spectroscopy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30762345,ACS sensors,2019 03 22,"We demonstrate the chemical characterization of aerosol particles with on-chip spectroscopy using a photonic cavity enhanced silicon nitride (Si3N4) racetrack resonator-based sensor.

Detection of N-methyl aniline-based aerosol in the near infrared (NIR) range of 1500 to 1600 nm is demonstrated. Our aerosol sensor spectral data compares favorably with that from a commercial spectrometer, indicating good accuracy.

Theoretical studies have suggested that the magnetic anisotropy in 1 is made possible by pronounced stabilization of the iron d z2 orbital due to 3d z2-4s mixing, an effect which is predicted to be less pronounced in the neutral iron(II) complex Fe(C(SiMe3)3)2 (2). However, experimental support for this interpretation has remained lacking. Here, we use high-resolution single-crystal X-ray diffraction data to generate multipole models of the electron density in these two complexes, which clearly show that the iron d z2 orbital is more populated in 1 than in 2. This result can be interpreted as arising from greater stabilization of the d z2 orbital in 1, thus offering an unprecedented experimental rationale for the origin of magnetic anisotropy in 1.",Postsynthetic Metal Exchange in a Metal-Organic Framework Assembled from Co(III) Diphosphine Pincer Complexes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30762343,Inorganic chemistry,2019 03 08,"A Zr metal-organic framework (MOF) 1-CoCl3 has been synthesized by solvothermal reaction of ZrCl4 with a carboxylic acid-functionalized CoIII-PNNNP pincer complex H4(L-CoCl3) ([L-CoCl3]4- = [(2,6-(NHPAr2)2C6H3)CoCl3]4-, Ar = p-C6H4CO2-). The structure of 1-CoCl3 has been determined by X-ray powder diffraction and exhibits a csq topology that differs from previously reported ftw-net Zr MOFs assembled from related PdII- and PtII-PNNNP pincer complexes. The Co-PNNNP pincer species readily demetallate upon reduction of CoIII to CoII, allowing for transmetalation with late second and third row transition metals in both the homogeneous complex and 1-CoCl3. Reaction of 1-CoCl3 with [Rh(nbd)Cl]2 (nbd = 2,5-nobornadiene) results in complete Rh/Co metal exchange at the supported diphosphine pincer complexes to generate 1-RhCl, which has been inaccessible by direct solvothermal synthesis. Treating 1-CoCl3 with PtCl2(SMe2)2 in the presence of the mild reductant NEt3 resulted in nearly complete Co substitution by Pt.

Blood management focus on the perioperative management of patients undergoing surgery or other invasive procedures in which significant blood loss occurs or is expected. Preventive strategies are emphasized to identify and manage anemia, reduce iatrogenic blood losses, optimize hemostasis (e.g. pharmacologic therapy, and point of care testing); establish decision thresholds for the appropriate administration of blood therapy. This goal was motivated historically by known blood risks including transmissible infectious disease, transfusion reactions, and potential effects of immunomodulation. Patient blood management has been recognized by the World Health Organization (WHO) as the new standard of care and has urged all 193-member countries of WHO to implement this concept. There is a pressing need for this new ""standard of care"" so as to reduce blood transfusion and promote the availability of transfusion alternatives. Patient blood management therefore encompasses an evidence-based medical and surgical approach that is multidisciplinary (transfusion medicine specialists, surgeons, anesthesiologists, and critical care specialists) and multiprofessional (physicians, nurses, pump technologists and pharmacists). The Italian Society of Anesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation and Intensive Care (SIAARTI) organized a consensus project involving a Task Force of expert anesthesiologists that reviewing literature provide appropriate levels of care and good clinical practices.

The Initiative uses quantitative systems toxicology (QST) to build and refine a model (DILIsym) capable of understanding and predicting liver safety liabilities in new drug candidates and to optimize interpretation of liver safety biomarkers used in clinical studies. Insights gained to date include the observation that most dose-dependent hepatotoxicity can be accounted for by combinations of just three mechanisms (oxidative stress, interference with mitochondrial respiration, and alterations in bile acid homeostasis) and the importance of noncompetitive inhibition of bile acid transporters. The effort has also provided novel insight into species and interpatient differences in susceptibility, structure-activity relationships, and the role of nonimmune mechanisms in delayed idiosyncratic hepatotoxicity.

Vernalization 1 (VRN1) encodes a crucial transcriptional repressor involved in plant vernalization that contains two B3 DNA-binding domains connected by an intrinsic disorder region (IDR) and nonspecifically binds DNA. We found that the Arabidopsis VRN1 protein undergoes liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) with DNA that is driven by multivalent protein-DNA interactions (LLPS), and that both B3 domains are required. The distribution of charged residues in the VRN1 IDR modulates the interaction strength between VRN1 and DNA, and changes in the charge pattern lead to interconversion between different states (precipitates, liquid droplets, and no phase separation). We further showed that VRN1 forms puncta in plant cell nuclei, suggesting that it may stabilize the vernalized state by repressing gene expression through LLPS.",Molecular characterization of Anaplasma and Ehrlichia in ixodid ticks and reservoir hosts from Palestine: a pilot survey.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30762295,Veterinary medicine and science,2019 05 08,"Tick-borne anaplasmosis and ehrlichiosis are clinically important emerging zoonoses usually overlooked by veterinarians and physicians alike.

Hansen solubility parameter (HSP) space could be used to define high, medium and low swelling regions for each resin. The variation of resin swelling with binary solvent composition could then be explained based on the HSP parameters of the two solvents and the way in which the line connecting the points corresponding to the two pure solvents bisected the swelling region for the resin. The applicability of the methodology was demonstrated by showing that an appropriate mixture of two green solvents was more effective for solid-phase peptide synthesis on Merrifield resin than use of either individual solvent and could completely replace the use of traditional polar aprotic and chlorinated solvents for this application. It was also shown that the high resin swelling area of Merrifield resin can be used to predict mixtures of green solvents that will dissolve linear, unfunctionalised polystyrene.",Long-term efficacy and safety of biosimilar infliximab (CT-P13) after switching from originator infliximab: open-label extension of the NOR-SWITCH trial.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30762274,Journal of internal medicine,2019 05 20,"The 52-week, randomized, double-blind, noninferiority, government-funded NOR-SWITCH trial demonstrated that switching from infliximab originator to less expensive biosimilar CT-P13 was not inferior to continued treatment with infliximab originator.

Additionally, time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) images of lipid distributions in the cell membrane after zinc treatment correlate to changes in exocytosis. By combining electrochemical techniques and mass spectrometry imaging, we proposed a mechanism by which zinc changes the fusion pore and the rate of neurotransmitter release by changing lipid distributions and results in the modulation of synaptic strength and plasticity.",Iridium(I)-Catalyzed C-H Borylation in Air by Using Mechanochemistry.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30762271,"Chemistry (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)",2019 03 28,"Mechanochemistry has been applied for the first time to an iridium(I)-catalyzed C-H borylation reaction.

In this clinical trial, 56 patients with MetS aged 18-60 years received either 75-mg CuEO or placebo soft gel, thrice daily, for 8 weeks. Data on anthropometric parameters, food consumption, tumor necrosis factor alpha, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase, catalase, total antioxidant capacity (TAC), and malondialdehyde (MDA) were assessed at the beginning and at the end of the study.

Diagnosis and subsequent management of urinary reflux have become increasingly debated in the past decade, with divergent opinions over which patients should be evaluated for reflux, and when detected, which children should receive intervention. Although some argue that vesicoureteral reflux is a ""phenotype"" that often resolves without intervention, others contest that untreated reflux has the potential to cause irreversible renal damage over time. Voiding cystourethrogram images the urethra and bladder during both bladder filling and emptying, as well as the ureters and kidneys when reflux is present, and is considered the gold standard for diagnosing vesicoureteral reflux. Once detected, therapeutic options for urinary reflux are diverse, ranging from observation with or without low-dose antibiotic prophylaxis to a variety of operative interventions. Management should be based on a multitude of factors including patient age, risk of subsequent urinary tract infections, risk of renal parenchymal injury, a given child's projected clinical course and parental preference. Over the past two decades, investigators have elucidated many crucial voiding cystourethrogram findings in addition to grade that provide significant prognostic information and are useful in determining the best course of action for a child on a more individualized basis.",An Emergency Department-Initiated Intervention to Lower Relapse Risk after Attempted Suicide.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30762253,Suicide & life-threatening behavior,2019 02 15,"According to randomized trials, contact after a suicide attempt lowers relapse risk.

Cell 2d (i.e., the second micromere of the D quadrant) in the oligochaete Tubifex tubifex also undergoes an evolutionarily conserved sequence of cell division to produce four bilateral pairs of ectodermal teloblasts that act as embryonic stem cells. This study was conducted to characterize each of the 15 rounds of cell division that occur in the 2d cell lineage in this clitellate. After its occurrence, cell 2d undergoes three rounds of highly unequal divisions, giving off the first smaller daughter cell toward the posterior right of the larger daughter cell, the second cell toward the posterior left, and the third cell toward the anterior side of the cell; the larger daughter cell that results from the third division (i.e., the great-granddaughter cell of 2d) then divides equally into a bilateral pair of NOPQ proteloblasts. Cell NOPQ on either side of the embryo undergoes 11 rounds of cell division, during which ectoteloblasts N, Q, and O/P are produced in this order. After its appearance, NOPQ undergoes highly unequal divisions twice cutting off the smaller cells toward the anterior end of the embryo and then divides almost equally into ectoteloblast N and proteloblast OPQ. After its appearance, OPQ undergoes highly unequal divisions twice giving off the first smaller cell toward the anterior and the second smaller cell toward the posterior of the embryo and then divides almost equally into ectoteloblast Q and proteloblast OP. Finally, OP undergoes highly unequal division four times after its birth budding off the smaller cells toward the anterior and then cleaves equally into ectoteloblasts O and P. In the unequally dividing cells of the 2d cell lineage, the mitotic apparatus (MA), which forms at the cell's center, moves eccentrically toward the cortical site where the smaller cell will be given off. The moving MA is oriented perpendicular to the surface it approaches, and its peripheral pole becomes closely associated with the cell cortex. In contrast, the MA involved in the equal divisions remains in the cell center throughout mitosis. The key features of the cleavage program in the 2d cell lineage are discussed in light of the present observations. The mechanical aspects of unequal cleavage in the 2d cell lineage and the modes of specification of MA orientation are discussed. A comparison of the cleavage mode in the 2d cell lineage is also performed among six selected clitellate annelid species.","Acanthosis nigricans, hypochondroplasia, and FGFR3 mutations: Findings with five new patients, and a review of the literature.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30762251,Pediatric dermatology,2019 04 01,"Early development of extensive acanthosis nigricans (AN) is a key feature in some patients who have hypochondroplasia (HCH) in association with FGFR3 mutations.

We examined the muscle arrangement in the penial complex (penis and penis sheath) of most major groups of freshwater pulmonates to explore to which extent the copulatory musculature can serve as a source of phylogenetic information for Hygrophila. The penises of Acroloxus lacustris (Acroloxidae), Radix auricularia (Lymnaeidae), and Physella acuta (Physidae) posses inner and outer layers of circular muscles and an intermediate layer of longitudinal muscles. The inner and outer muscle layers in the penis of Biomphalaria glabrata consist of circular muscles, but this species has two intermediate longitudinal layers separated by a lacunar space, which is crossed by radial and transverse fibers. The muscular wall of the penis of Planorbella duryi is composed of transverse and longitudinal fibers, with circular muscles as the outer layer. In Planorbidae, the penial musculature consists of inner and outer layers of longitudinal muscles and an intermediate layer of radial muscles. The penis sheath shows more variation in muscle patterns: its muscular wall has two layers in A. lacustris, P. acuta, and P. duryi, three layers in R. auricularia and Planorbinae and four layers in B. glabrata. To trace the evolution of the penial musculature, we mapped the muscle characters on a molecular phylogeny constructed from the concatenated 18S and mtCOI data set. The most convincing synapomorphies were found for Planorbinae (inner and outer penis layers of longitudinal muscles, three-layered wall of the penis sheath). A larger clade coinciding with Planorbidae is defined by the presence of radial muscles and two longitudinal layers in the penis. The comparative analysis of the penial musculature appears to be a promising tool in unraveling the phylogeny of Hygrophila.","Skin-to-skin contact the first hour after birth, underlying implications and clinical practice.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30762247,"Acta paediatrica (Oslo, Norway : 1992)",2019 03 14,"This paper integrates clinical expertise to earlier research about the behaviours of the healthy, alert, full-term infant placed skin-to-skin with the mother during the first hour after birth following a noninstrumental vaginal birth.",Childhood pemphigus foliaceus presenting as a polycyclic eruption: Case report and review of the literature.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30762246,Pediatric dermatology,2019 04 01,"Pemphigus foliaceus (PF) is an autoimmune bullous disorder that has occasionally been reported to present as a polycyclic or arcuate eruption in children.

The following method allows one to use all available well record data to produce baseline hydrogeologic unit maps using geographic information system querying and mapping techniques. Subjective borehole and geophysical strata descriptions are converted to objective equivalent numerical values by establishing the average hydraulic conductivity of the combined soils making up the stratum of interest. These hydraulic conductivity values are then used to assign each stratum to a hydrogeologic unit based on typical ranges of hydraulic conductivity for aquifers, aquitards and aquicludes. The resulting data are queried and mapped to provide a preliminary description of a shallow aquifer system composed of unconsolidated materials. This method can be used to provide information to make initial estimates of the configuration of the shallow aquifer system and to plan for groundwater sustainability.

We examined the relationship of aboveground biomass (AGB) and diversity of adult trees with soil fertility (nitrogen, phosphorus, organic matter, etc.) in the context of different spatial distributions of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) and ectomycorrhizal (EM) trees in a temperate forest in Northeast China. Diversity showed a positive trend along the soil fertility gradient driven mostly by a positive relationship between AM tree abundance and soil fertility. By contrast, the AGB showed a negative trend along the soil fertility gradient driven mostly by a negative relationship between EM tree AGB and soil fertility. Furthermore, the opposite trend in the AGB and tree species diversity along the soil fertility gradient led to an overall negative diversity-biomass relationship at the 50-m scale but not the 20-m scale. These results suggest that tree mycorrhizal associations play a critical role in driving forest community structure along soil fertility gradients and highlight the importance of tree mycorrhizal associations in influencing how the diversity-ecosystem function (e.g. biomass) relationships change with soil fertility.","Assemblage structure, vertical distributions and stable-isotope compositions of anguilliform leptocephali in the Gulf of Mexico.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30762230,Journal of fish biology,2019 06 04,"In August 2007, October 2008 and September-October 2010, 241 Tucker trawl and plankton net tows were conducted at the surface to depths of 1377 m at six locations in the northern and eastern Gulf of Mexico (GOM) to document leptocephalus diversity and determine how assemblage structure, larval size, abundance and isotopic signatures differ across the region and with depth. Overall, 2696 leptocephali representing 59 distinct taxa from 10 families were collected. Five families accounted for 96% of the total catch with Congridae and Ophichthidae being the most abundant. The top four most abundant species composed 59% of the total catch and included: Ariosoma balearicum, Paraconger caudilimbatus, Rhynchoconger flavus and Ophichthus gomesii. Four anguilliform species not previously documented in the GOM as adults or leptocephali were collected in this study, including Monopenchelys acuta, Quassiremus ascensionis, Saurenchelys stylura and one leptocephalus only known from its larval stage, Leptocephalus proboscideus. Leptocephalus catches were significantly greater at night than during the day. Catches at night were concentrated in the upper 200 m of the water column and significantly declined with increasing depth. Leptocephali abundances and assemblages were significantly different between sites on the upper continental slope (c. 500 m depth) and sites on the middle to lower continental slope (c. 1500-2300 m). Sites on the lower continental slope had a mixture of deep-sea demersal, bathypelagic and coastal species, whereas upper-slope sites contained several numerically dominant species (e.g., A. balearicum, P. caudilimbatus) that probably spawn over the continental shelf and upper slope of the GOM. Standard lengths of the four dominant species differed between sites and years, indicating heterochronic reproduction and potential larval source pools within and outside of the GOM. Stable-isotope analyses (δ13 C and δ15 N) conducted on 185 specimens from six families revealed that leptocephali had a wide range of isotopic values at the family and size-class levels. Species in the families Muraenidae, Congridae and Ophichthidae had similar δ15 N values compared with the broad range of δ15 N values seen in the deep-sea families Nemichthyidae, Nettastomatidae and Synaphobranchidae. Stable-isotope values were variably related to length, with δ15 N values being positively size correlated in ophichthids and δ13 C values being negatively size correlated in A. balearicum and P. caudilimbatus. Results suggest that leptocephali feed in various water depths and masses, and on different components of POM, which could lead to niche partitioning. Ecological aspects of these important members of the plankton community provide insight into larval connectivity in the GOM as well as the early life history of Anguilliformes.",Wind turbines cause functional habitat loss for migratory soaring birds.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30762229,The Journal of animal ecology,2019 03 16,"Wind energy production has expanded to meet climate change mitigation goals, but negative impacts of wind turbines have been reported on wildlife. Soaring birds are among the most affected groups with alarming fatality rates by collision with wind turbines and an escalating occupation of their migratory corridors. These birds have been described as changing their flight trajectories to avoid wind turbines, but this behaviour may lead to functional habitat loss, as suitable soaring areas in the proximity of wind turbines will likely be underused. We modelled the displacement effect of wind turbines on black kites (Milvus migrans) tracked by GPS. We also evaluated the impact of this effect at the scale of the landscape by estimating how much suitable soaring area was lost to wind turbines. We used state-of-the-art tracking devices to monitor the movements of 130 black kites in an area populated by wind turbines, at the migratory bottleneck of the Strait of Gibraltar. Landscape use by birds was mapped from GPS data using dynamic Brownian bridge movement models, and generalized additive mixed modelling was used to estimate the effect of wind turbine proximity on bird use while accounting for orographic and thermal uplift availability. We found that areas up to approximately 674 m away from the turbines were less used than expected given their uplift potential. Within that distance threshold, bird use decreased with the proximity to wind turbines. We estimated that the footprint of wind turbines affected 3%-14% of the areas suitable for soaring in our study area. We present evidence that the impacts of wind energy industry on soaring birds are greater than previously acknowledged. In addition to the commonly reported fatalities, the avoidance of turbines by soaring birds causes habitat losses in their movement corridors. Authorities should recognize this further impact of wind energy production and establish new regulations that protect soaring habitat. We also showed that soaring habitat for birds can be modelled at a fine scale using publicly available data. Such an approach can be used to plan low-impact placement of turbines in new wind energy developments.",A Practical Approach to Assessing and Mitigating Loneliness and Isolation in Older Adults.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30762228,Journal of the American Geriatrics Society,2019 04 10,"Loneliness and social isolation are strongly associated with several adverse health outcomes in older persons including death and functional impairments. The strength of these associations has been compared with smoking. Accordingly, loneliness and isolation have significant public health implications. Despite the adverse impacts of loneliness and social isolation on quality of life, and their strong association with health outcomes, the evaluation of loneliness and isolation have not been integrated into medical care. The risks for loneliness may be of particular concern to persons with serious illness as patients and caregivers cope with the experience of loss, loss of independence, and increasing care needs. To date, there has been no uniform way of evaluating and documenting loneliness and social isolation as a part of a review of a patient's social determinants of health. This article provides a framework for healthcare systems, providers, and community members working with older adults to (1) understand loneliness, isolation, and its counterpart social connection; (2) describe the different ways loneliness affects health; and (3) create a framework for asking about and documenting these experiences. Finally, because the lack of studies assessing whether targeting loneliness can improve health outcomes is a major gap, we provide guidance on the future of interventions.

We separately analyzed left and right breast density of Dutch women from a 13-year period (2003-2016) in the breast cancer screening programme. First, we analyzed age-specific changes in average percent dense volume (PDV) across birth cohorts. A linear regression analysis (PDV vs. year of birth) indicated a small but statistically significant increase in women of: 1) age 50 and born from 1952 to 1966 (left, slope = 0.04, p = 0.003; right, slope = 0.09, p < 0.0001); 2) age 55 and born from 1948 to 1961 (right, slope = 0.04, p = 0.01); and 3) age 70 and born from 1933 to 1946 (right, slope = 0.05, p = 0.002). A decrease of total breast volume seemed to explain the increase in PDV. Second, we compared proportion of women with dense breast in women born in 1946-1953 and 1959-1966, and observed a statistical significant increase of proportion of highly dense breast in later born women, in the 51 to 55 age-groups for the left breast (around a 20% increase in each age-group), and in the 50 to 56 age-groups for the right breast (increase ranging from 27% to 48%). The study indicated a slight increase in mammography density across birth cohorts, most pronounced for women in their early 50s, and more marked for the right than for the left breast.",Method for the Rapid Fixation of Gastrointestinal Helminths in Small Mammals.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30762224,Acta parasitologica,2019 02 14,"Despite being a significant element of biodiversity and playing an important role in their hosts' physiology, ecology and evolution, parasites remain understudied and are often neglected during biotic surveys and other collection efforts.

It has become a versatile tool for detecting and characterising prostate cancer (PCa). The traditional role of mpMRI was confined to PCa staging, but due to the advanced imaging techniques, its role has expanded to various stages in clinical practises including tumour detection, disease monitor during active surveillance and sequential imaging for patient follow-up. Meanwhile, with the growing speed of data generation and the increasing volume of imaging data, it is highly demanded to apply computerised methods to process mpMRI data and extract useful information. Hence quantitative analysis for imaging data using radiomics has become an emerging paradigm. The application of radiomics approaches in prostate cancer has not only enabled automatic localisation of the disease but also provided a non-invasive solution to assess tumour biology (e.g. aggressiveness and the presence of hypoxia). This article reviews mpMRI and its expanding role in PCa detection, staging and patient management. Following that, an overview of prostate radiomics will be provided, with a special focus on its current applications as well as its future directions.",Computational study on hemodynamic changes in patient-specific proximal neck angulation of abdominal aortic aneurysm with time-varying velocity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30762222,Australasian physical & engineering sciences in medicine,2019 03 26,"Aneurysms are considered as a critical cardiovascular disease worldwide when they rupture. The clinical understanding of geometrical impact on the flow behaviour and biomechanics of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is progressively developing. Proximal neck angulations of AAAs are believed to influence the hemodynamic changes and wall shear stress (WSS) within AAAs. Our aim was to perform pulsatile simulations using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) for patient-specific geometry to investigate the influence of severe angular (≥ 60°) neck on AAA's hemodynamic and wall shear stress. The patient's geometrical characteristics were obtained from a computed tomography images database of AAA patients. The AAA geometry was reconstructed using Mimics software. In computational method, blood was assumed Newtonian fluid and an inlet varying velocity waveform in a cardiac cycle was assigned. The CFD study was performed with ANSYS software. The results of flow behaviours indicated that the blood flow through severe bending of angular neck leads to high turbulence and asymmetry of flows within the aneurysm sac resulting in blood recirculation. The high wall shear stress (WSS) occurred near the AAA neck and on surface of aneurysm sac. This study explained and showed flow behaviours and WSS progression within high angular neck AAA and risk prediction of abdominal aorta rupture. We expect that the visualization of blood flow and hemodynamic changes resulted from CFD simulation could be as an extra tool to assist clinicians during a decision making when estimation the risks of interventional procedures.","Design, manufacture and deployment of a low-cost area radiation monitoring system using Raspberry Pi computers and open-source software.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30762221,Australasian physical & engineering sciences in medicine,2019 03 26,"Monitoring of background radiation levels in radiopharmaceutical laboratories is a key tool in minimising dose to workers.

Subgrouping of myasthenia gravis is dependent on the age of onset, pattern of clinical weakness, autoantibody detected, type of thymic pathology, and response to immunotherapy. Generalized immunosuppressive therapies are effective in all subgroups of myasthenia gravis; however, approximately 15% remain refractory and more effective treatments with improved safety profiles are needed. In recent years, successful utilization of targeted B-cell therapies in this disease has triggered renewed focus in unraveling the underlying immunopathology in attempts to identify newer therapeutic targets. While myasthenia gravis is predominantly B-cell mediated, T cells, T cell-B cell interactions, and B-cell-related factors are increasingly recognized to play key roles in its immunopathology, particularly in autoantibody production, and novel therapies have focused on targeting these specific immune system components. This overview describes the current understanding of myasthenia gravis immunopathology before discussing B-cell-related therapies, their therapeutic targets, and the rationale and evidence for their use. Several prospective studies demonstrated efficacy of rituximab in various myasthenia gravis subtypes, particularly that characterized by antibodies against muscle-specific tyrosine kinase. However, a recent randomized control trial in patients with acetylcholine receptor antibodies was negative. Eculizumab, a complement inhibitor, has recently gained regulatory approval for myasthenia gravis based on a phase III trial that narrowly missed its primary endpoint while achieving robust results in all secondary endpoints. Zilucoplan is a subcutaneously administered terminal complement inhibitor that recently demonstrated significant improvements in functional outcome measures in a phase II trial. Rozanolixizumab, CFZ533, belimumab, and bortezomib are B-cell-related therapies that are in the early stages of evaluation in treating myasthenia gravis. The rarity of myasthenia gravis, heterogeneity in its clinical manifestations, and variability in immunosuppressive regimens are challenges to conducting successful trials. Nonetheless, these are promising times for myasthenia gravis, as renewed research efforts provide novel insights into its immunopathology, allowing for development of targeted therapies with increased efficacy and safety.",A Systematic Review of the Evaluation of Interventions to Tackle Children's Food Insecurity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30762204,Current nutrition reports,2019 04 07,To synthesise the research which has sought to evaluate interventions aiming to tackle children's food insecurity and the contribution of this research to evidencing the effectiveness of such interventions.,Chest Tuberculosis in Children.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30762202,Indian journal of pediatrics,2019 05 12,"Chest is the commonest site of involvement by tuberculosis (TB) in children; lungs being the most frequently affected region, followed by nodes, pleura and chest wall.

As seen in other viral infections, type I IFN can also increase systemic immune activation which, in HIV disease, is one of the strongest predictors of disease progression to acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) and non-AIDS morbidity and mortality. Moreover, IFN-I is associated with CD4 T cell depletion and attenuation of antigen-specific T cell responses. Therefore, therapeutic manipulation of IFN-I signaling to improve HIV disease outcome is a source of much interest and debate in the field. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of timing (acute vs. chronic infection) and have suggested that specific targeting of type I IFNs and their subtypes may help harness the beneficial roles of the IFN-I system while avoiding its deleterious activities.","The skin rejuvenation associated treatment-Fraxel laser, Microbotox, and low G prime hyaluronic acid: preliminary results.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30762198,Lasers in medical science,2019 02 14,"Minimally invasive facial rejuvenation procedures reached an all-time high in the 2016.

Lichen tissues sampled at 16 representative sites in the same season of 1995 and 2014 were analyzed for a total of 94 individual and 27 sum parameters of POPs and PAHs by means of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS). The comparative analyses showed a decrease of 40 to 80% (medians) for most of the POPs and PAHs concentration in lichens at all site categories. Reduction in tissue concentration of the polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins/furans (PCDD/PCDFs), such as the highly toxic 2,3,7,8-TetraCDD and the TEQ according to WHO (2005) were 66% and 73%, respectively.

The results of this study highlight for the first time in biota the positive effect of emission regulation of POPs in Switzerland.",The adsorption behavior of multiple contaminants like heavy metal ions and p-nitrophenol on organic-modified montmorillonite.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30762184,Environmental science and pollution research international,2019 05 29,"Stearyl trimethyl ammonium chloride (STAC) and ethylenediamine (En) were successfully implanted into montmorillonite (MMt) interlayer to fabricate the novel adsorbent STAC-En-MMt for the simultaneous adsorption of Cu2+, Zn2+, and p-nitrophenol (PNP). X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, elemental analyzer, zeta potential analyzer, inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, and UV-visible spectrophotometer were used to investigate the microstructure characteristics of STAC-En-MMt and their adsorption capacity of target contaminants. Four factors such as pH, the molar ratio between En and STAC (REn/STAC), the adsorption time (ATime), and the adsorption temperature (ATemp) were selected to investigate the adsorption capacities of Cu2+, Zn2+, and PNP onto STAC-En-MMt in ternary solution. The results indicated that the total simultaneous adsorption of Cu2+, Zn2+, and PNP onto STAC-En-MMt adsorbent with REn/STAC = 0.75 reached up to 260.27 mmol·kg-1 under the condition of pH = 6, ATemp = 40 °C, and ATime = 60 min. After three regenerations, there was still a good performance in the adsorption of STAC-En-MMt. The Langmuir adsorption isotherm indicated that the adsorption of heavy metals and PNP onto adsorbents were single-layer surface adsorption. Nonlinear adsorption kinetics simulation indicated that chemical adsorption occupied a predominant position in Cu2+ and Zn2+ adsorption, while PNP adsorption depended on physical adsorption. Compared with Zn2+, Cu2+ had higher affinity for the adsorption sites on STAC-En-MMt. However, the pore blocking caused by the Cu2+ and Zn2+ adsorption had a remarkably adverse effect on PNP adsorption.",Field-aged biochar reduces the greenhouse gas balance in a degraded vegetable field treated by reductive soil disinfestation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30762183,Environmental science and pollution research international,2019 04 19,"Reductive soil disinfestation (RSD) is proposed as a pre-plant, non-chemical soil disinfestation technique to control several soilborne phytosanitary issues. However, limited information is available on the evaluation of greenhouse gas (GHG) balance and soil quality during the soil remediation process as affected by RSD method. A 44-day field experiment including four different treatments was conducted to investigate the effects of conventional RSD and field-aged biochar-amended RSD on GHG balance and soil quality in a degraded vegetable field. Results showed that the conventional RSD application can significantly decrease the soil nitrate (NO3-) concentrations and electrical conductivity (EC) and oxidation-reduction potential (Eh) by 51.4-67.3%, 5.3-23.6%, and 10.9-15.1%, respectively, while significantly increase soil pH and cation exchange capacity (CEC) by 0.37-0.42 units and 7.8-32.2%, respectively, in relation to the control (CK). Compared with the conventional RSD treatment, aged biochar-amended RSD significantly reduced soil NO3- concentrations, EC and Eh. No significant differences on CH4 emissions were observed among all the treatments during the experimental period. However, the conventional RSD application significantly increased the cumulative nitrous oxide (N2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by 66.2-124.7% and 64.3-130.0%, respectively, and thus resulted in a significant GHG balance of 64.1-130.1% in relation to the CK. On the contrary, although resulted in more N2O emissions compared with the conventional RSD treatment, aged biochar-amended RSD significantly reduced the cumulative CO2 emissions and thus had an overall decrease in GHG balance by 20.7-28.7%. Therefore, aged biochar-amended RSD can simultaneously achieve lower GHG balance and better improvement of soil quality in degraded vegetable field, and thus can be utilized as an effective technology for soil remediation in intensive vegetable production.",Assessment of Euro 5 diesel vehicle NOx emissions by laboratory and track testing.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30762182,Environmental science and pollution research international,2019 04 19,"The Volkswagen scandal has promoted experimental campaigns worldwide aimed to assess the real exhaust emissions of in-use vehicles. Attention has been paid to diesel vehicle NOx emissions that are much higher than legislative type-approval limits. This paper analysed exhaust emissions of a fleet of ten Euro 5 diesel vehicles. NOx emissions were measured during laboratory and track testing. In both cases, the type-approval test was carried out with cold and warm starts. Moreover, in the laboratory, a modified type-approval test and a real urban driving cycle were executed in order to characterise emissions in multiple operating conditions, outside of the homologation boundaries. The testing environment did not influence the emissions behaviour of the tested vehicles. Track and laboratory results, in fact, were comparable when ambient conditions were comparable. The parameter which played the main role in terms of NOx emissions is the ambient temperature, fixed at 23 °C in laboratory and not controlled on the track. Above 28 °C, NOx emissions were much higher than the approval limit (almost 600 mg/km). Moreover, warm driving cycles always introduced higher NOx emissions than cold ones, because of the partial use and/or deactivation of the EGR circuit (one of effective measures to reduce NOx formation). The ratio between warm and cold emissions ranged from 2 to 5. The engine parameter which helped explain the relationship between NOx emissions and thermal engine status was the intake air temperature. For intake air temperatures below 40 °C, NOx emissions were lower than 0.2 g/km. Above 40 °C, they suddenly increased up to almost 0.6 g/km. Another issue highlighted by the experimental results was that dynamic real driving caused the highest NOx emissions (almost 1 g/km).",Overexpression of OsLea14-A improves the tolerance of rice and increases Hg accumulation under diverse stresses.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30762181,Environmental science and pollution research international,2019 04 19,"The group 5 LEA (late embryogenesis abundant) proteins are an atypical LEA protein group, which is associated with resistance to multiple stresses. In this study, OsLea14-A gene was isolated from Oryza sativa L., which encodes a 5C LEA protein with 151 amino acids. The qPCR analysis showed that OsLea14-A expressed in all tissues and organs at all times. The expression of OsLea14-A in the panicles of plumping stage were dramatically increased. The heterologous expression of OsLea14-A in Escherichia coli improved its growth performance under salinity, desiccation, high temperature, and freeze-thaw stresses. The purified OsLea14-A protein can protect LDH activity from freeze-thaw-, heat-, and desiccation-induced inactivation. The overexpression of OsLea14-A in rice improved tolerance to dehydration, high salinity, CuSO4, and HgCl2, but excluding K2Cr2O7. The analysis of metal contents showed that the accumulation of OsLea14-A protein in transgenic rice could increase the accumulation of Hg, but could not increase the accumulation of Na, Cr, and Cu after HgCl2, NaCl, K2Cr2O7, and CuSO4 treatment, respectively. These results suggested that OsLea14-A conferred multiple stress tolerance and Hg accumulation, which made it a possible gene in genetic improvement for plants to acclimatize itself to multiple stresses and remediate Hg-contaminated soil.",Long-term responses of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) to the contamination of light soils with diesel oil.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30762180,Environmental science and pollution research international,2019 05 05,"Research into trees plays a very important role in evaluations of soil contamination with diesel oil. Trees are ideal for reclaiming contaminated soils because their large biomass renders them more resistant to higher concentrations of pollutants. In the literature, there is a general scarcity of long-term studies performed on trees, in particular European beeches. The aim of this study was to evaluate the responses of Scots pines and European beeches grown for 8 years on soil contaminated with diesel oil. Selected morphological and physiological parameters of trees were analyzed. The biomass yield of Scots pines was not significantly correlated with increasing concentrations of diesel oil, but it was more than 700% higher than in European beeches. Scots pines were taller and had a larger stem diameter than European beeches during the 8-year study. The diameter of trees grown on the most contaminated soil was reduced 1.5-fold in Scots pines and more than twofold in European beeches. The length of Scots pine needles from the most contaminated treatment decreased by 50% relative to control needles. The shortest needles were heaviest. The fluctuating asymmetry (FA) of needle length was highest in Scots pines grown on the most contaminated soil, whereas the reverse was noted in the FA of needle weight. Diesel oil decreased the concentrations of chlorophylls a and b, total chlorophyll, and carotenoids. The Fv/Fm ratio of needles and leaves was influenced by the tested concentrations of diesel oil. The results of the study indicate that the Scots pine better adapts (grows more rapidly and produces higher biomass) to long-term soil contamination with diesel oil than the European beech. In European beeches, growth inhibition and leaf discoloration (a decrease in chlorophyll content) were observed already after the first year of the experiment, which indicates that 1-year-old seedlings of European beech are robust bioindicators of soil contamination with diesel oil.",Effects of antibiotics on nitrogen uptake of four wetland plant species grown under hydroponic culture.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30762179,Environmental science and pollution research international,2019 04 19,"To investigate the effects of antibiotics on nitrogen removal and uptake by wetland plants, four typical macrophyte species, Cyperus alternifolius L., Typha angustifolia L., Lythrum salicaria L., and Acorus calamus L., were grown in hydroponic cultivation systems and fed wastewater polluted with 10 μg L-1 Ofloxacin (OFL) and Tetracycline (TET). Biomass production, nitrogen mass concentration, chlorophyll content, root exudates, and nitrogen removal efficiency of hydroponic cultivation were investigated. The results indicated that in all hydroponic systems, NH4+-N was entirely removed from the hydroponic substrate within 1 day and plant nitrogen accumulation was the main role of the removed NO3-. OFL and TET stimulated the accumulation of biomass and nitrogen of A. calamus but significantly inhibited the NO3--N removal ability of L. salicaria (98.6 to 76.2%) and T. augustifolia (84.3 to 40.2%). This indicates that A. calamus may be a good choice for nitrogen uptake in wetlands contaminated with antibiotics. OFL and TET improved the concentrations of total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN), organic acid, and soluble sugars in root exudates, especially for oxalic acid.

The aim of this study was to determine in vitro antioxidant, antimicrobial activities, anticholinesterase (acetylcholinesterase (AChE)/butyrylcholinesterase (BChE)), antidiabetic activities (α-glucosidase/α-amylase) and Tyrosinase inhibitor activity of methanol and water extracts of H. lydium. Also, gene expression has been evaluated in the shoot and root by microarray technology. So, in general, the purpose of this study is to study the active molecules such as antioxidant, antimicrobial, antidiabetic, enzymes and genes in the plant, which is the first to be reported. The experiments were conducted in a completely randomized design with three replications. In addition, gene expression was compared in the shoot and root parts. Expression profiling was carried out by microarrays. According to the results, the highest chemical components were determined in methanol extract rather than water extract. There was a difference between the obtained components. While the highest antioxidant activity was determined from the methanol extract of plant herbs for DPPH Free Radical Scavenging Activity, antioxidant activity was the same in both methanol and water extracts using the ABTS method. The methanol extract demonstrated stronger anticholinesterase (AChE and BChE) and α-amylase inhibition activity. This study was complemented by the detection of antioxidant activity and some enzyme inhibition activity in the methanol extract. Microarray showed 10,784 genes had significantly different expression in root and shoot. There was a positive effect of methanol extract in respect of different activities compared to the water extract. Gene expression showed that the number of expressed genes in the root was greater than the shoot.","A Comparison Study of Algorithms to Detect Drug-Adverse Event Associations: Frequentist, Bayesian, and Machine-Learning Approaches.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30762164,Drug safety,2019 05 20,"It is important to monitor the safety profile of drugs, and mining for strong associations between drugs and adverse events is an effective and inexpensive method of post-marketing safety surveillance.",Drug-Induced Steatosis and Steatohepatitis: The Search for Novel Serum Biomarkers Among Potential Biomarkers for Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease and Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30762163,Drug safety,2019 05 20,"Drug-induced steatosis (DIS) and drug-induced steatohepatitis (DISH) are two of several types of drug-induced liver injury (DILI). They can be caused by various drugs and may present as acute, potentially lethal disorders or as chronic slowly progressive liver injury. Despite the fact that they are distinct disorders, the slow progressive forms of DIS and DISH are often confused with or misdiagnosed as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) or non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which are much more common and, by definition, not caused by drugs. Currently the only way to identify DIS is via imaging studies or a liver biopsy, while DISH can be identified only through liver biopsy. In addition, diagnosis of either DIS or DISH requires an exhaustive clinical evaluation and comprehensive causality assessment to rule out other possible causes and determine the association with the suspected drug. Furthermore, it is difficult, using existing methods, to monitor the progression of DIS and DISH and to determine the underlying mechanism. Therefore, there is a great unmet need for non-invasive biomarkers that will be able to identify the development of DIS or DISH during drug development and to monitor for progression or regression of the disorder during treatment or following drug discontinuation. Recent developments in the fields of NAFLD and NASH have introduced several novel biomarkers that show promise for the diagnosis, monitoring, and severity assessment of these common diseases. Given the significant overlap in possible underlying mechanisms and histological pattern between NAFLD/NASH and DIS/DISH, these postulated NAFLD and NASH biomarkers may have a potential application to DIS and DISH. This article reviews the existing medical literature and other publically available information pertaining to novel serum biomarkers for NAFLD and NASH, and explores the concurrent identification of these biomarkers for DIS and DISH.",Imaging tumor acidosis: a survey of the available techniques for mapping in vivo tumor pH.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30762162,Cancer metastasis reviews,2019 02 14,"Cancer cells are characterized by a metabolic shift in cellular energy production, orchestrated by the transcription factor HIF-1α, from mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation to increased glycolysis, regardless of oxygen availability (Warburg effect). The constitutive upregulation of glycolysis leads to an overproduction of acidic metabolic products, resulting in enhanced acidification of the extracellular pH (pHe ~ 6.5), which is a salient feature of the tumor microenvironment. Despite the importance of pH and tumor acidosis, there is currently no established clinical tool available to image the spatial distribution of tumor pHe. The purpose of this review is to describe various imaging modalities for measuring intracellular and extracellular tumor pH. For each technique, we will discuss main advantages and limitations, pH accuracy and sensitivity of the applied pH-responsive probes and potential translatability to the clinic. Particular attention is devoted to methods that can provide pH measurements at high spatial resolution useful to address the task of tumor heterogeneity and to studies that explored tumor pH imaging for assessing treatment response to anticancer therapies.",Characterization of TEMINAL FLOWER1 homologs CmTFL1c gene from Chrysanthemum morifolium.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30762161,Plant molecular biology,2019 04 10,"The CmTFL1c gene of Chrysanthemum morifolium inhibits flowering, regulates inflorescence architecture and floral development. The timing of flowering is an important ornamental trait of chrysanthemum. The gene TERMINAL FLOWER1 (TFL1) has been shown to be involved in the regulation of meristem fate and flowering time regulation. Here, a TFL1 gene named as CmTFL1c, was cloned from Chrysanthemum morifolium and further characterized. The open reading frame of CmTFL1c comprises 522 bp, which encodes a polypeptide of 173 amino acids. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that CmTFL1c belongs to the CEN/TFL1 clade. CmTFL1c protein localizes to the nucleus as well as to plasma membrane, which suggests that CmTFL1c may be a transcription factor. The CmTFL1c gene was most highly expressed in vegetative stems, and weakly expressed in leaves and flower buds; both shoot apices and stems had sensitivity to photoperiod. Overexpression of CmTFL1c in wild Arabidopsis and tfl1-13 mutant led to late flowering and altered architecture, including increased secondary branching, and abnormal inflorescences and flowers. The CmTFL1c gene negatively regulated flowering by inhibiting the up-regulation of the AtFT, AtLFY and AtAP1. The biological function of CmTFL1c was further characterized in C. morifolium via Agrobacterium-mediated transformation, which showed that CmTFL1c not only delayed flowering and promoted axillary bud formation, but also played an important role in inflorescence formation of chrysanthemum. These results showed that the CmTFL1c affects flowering time and regulates inflorescence architecture.",Dissociation of memory signals for metamemory in rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30762160,Animal cognition,2019 06 10,"Some nonhuman species demonstrate metamemory, the ability to monitor and control memory. Here, we identify memory signals that control metamemory judgments in rhesus monkeys by directly comparing performance in two metamemory paradigms while holding the availability of one memory signal constant and manipulating another. Monkeys performed a four-choice match-to-sample memory task. In Experiment 1, monkeys could decline memory tests on some trials for a small, guaranteed reward. In Experiment 2, monkeys could review the sample on some trials. In both experiments, monkeys improved accuracy by selectively declining tests or reviewing samples when memory was poor. To assess the degree to which different memory signals made independent contributions to the metamemory judgement, we made the decline-test or review-sample response available either prospectively, before the test, or concurrently with test stimuli. Prospective metamemory judgements are likely controlled by the current contents of working memory, whereas concurrent metamemory judgements may also be controlled by additional relative familiarity signals evoked by the sight of the test stimuli. In both paradigms, metacognitive responding enhanced accuracy more on concurrent than on prospective tests, suggesting additive contributions of working memory and stimulus-evoked familiarity. Consistent with the hypothesis that working memory and stimulus-evoked familiarity both control metamemory judgments when available, metacognitive choice latencies were longer in the concurrent condition, when both were available. Together, these data demonstrate that multiple memory signals can additively control metacognitive judgements in monkeys and provide a framework for mapping the interaction of explicit memory signals in primate memory.",Adrenergic Modulation of Hematopoiesis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30762159,Journal of neuroimmune pharmacology : the official journal of the Society on NeuroImmune Pharmacology,2019 02 14,"Hematopoiesis produce every day billions of blood cells and takes place in the bone marrow (BM) by the proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC). HSC are found mainly adjacent to the BM vascular sinusoids where endothelial cells and mesenchimal stromal cells promote HSC maintenance by producing a variety of factors. Other cell types that regulate HSC niches include sympathetic nerves, non-myelinating Schwann cells and a variety of mature hematopoietic cells such as macrophages, neutrophils, and megakaryocytes. This review will focus on the role of adrenergic signals, i.e. of catecholamines, in the regulation of the HSC niche. The available evidence is rather controversial possibly due to the fact that adrenergic receptors are expressed by many cellular components of the niche and also by the often neglected observation that catecholamines may be produced and released also by the BM cells themselves. In addition one has to consider that, physiologically, the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity follows a circadian rhythmicity as driven by the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus but may be also activated by cognitive and non-cognitive environmental stimuli. The adrenergic modulation of hematopoiesis holds a considerable potential for pharmacological therapeutic approaches in a variety of hematopoietic disorders and for HSC transplantation however the complexity of the system demands further studies. Graphical Abstract Sympathetic nerve termini may release NE while mature BM cells may release norepinephrine (NE) and / or epinephrine (E). Both may bind to β-adrenergic receptor (AR) expressed in nestin+MSC in the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) niche and regulate the physiological trafficking of HSC by modulating the expression of CXCL12 and SCF. Both NE and E may also activate Lin - c-Kit+ Sca-1+ (LKS) cell via another AR. In addition, NE may also signal to α1-AR expressed in pre-B cells which by TGF-β secretion might regulate proliferation of their lymphoid progenitors in an autocrine manner and/or inhibit myeloid progenitors.",Changes in grey matter volume and functional connectivity in cluster headache versus migraine.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30762158,Brain imaging and behavior,2019 02 14,"Cluster headache (CH) shows a more severe clinical picture than migraine (Mig). We tested whether brain changes can explain such difference. Multimodal MRI was acquired in attack-free patients with CH (n = 12), Mig (n = 13) and in normal controls (NC, n = 13). We used FSL for MRI data analysis and nonparametric permutation testing for voxelwise analyses (p < 0.01, corrected). CH showed lower grey matter (GM) volume, compared to Mig and NC, in frontal cortex regions (inferior frontal gyrus and frontal pole [FP], respectively) and, only compared to Mig, in lateral occipital cortex (LOC). Functional connectivity (FC) of CH was higher than Mig and NC within working memory and executive control networks and, only compared to Mig, between cerebellar and auditory language comprehension networks. In the attack-free state, the CH brain seems to be characterized by: (i) GM volume decrease, compared to both Mig and NC, in pain modulation regions (FP) and, only with respect to Mig, in a region of visual processing modulation during pain and working memory (LOC); (ii) increased FC at short range compared to both Mig and NC and at long range only with respect to Mig, in key cognitive networks, likely due to maladaptation towards more severe pain experience.",The role of sleep quality on the relationship between posttraumatic stress symptoms and pain in women.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30762157,Journal of behavioral medicine,2019 02 14,"Pain frequently co-occurs with elevated posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS); women are at elevated risk for their co-occurrence. PTSS and pain are associated with poor sleep quality; yet, little research has examined how sleep impacts their co-occurrence. The current study examines the indirect role of sleep on the relationship between PTSS and pain. A community sample of 182 women completed psychometrically-sound questionnaires assessing PTSS, sleep quality, pain characteristics, depression and anxiety symptoms, and anxiety sensitivity. We examined how sleep quality impacted associations among PTSS and pain intensity and pain interference, while controlling for key psychological factors. Greater PTSS was associated with worse pain interference, and poor sleep quality had a significant indirect effect on this relationship. Sleep may represent a modifiable behavioral mechanism that contributes to the mutual maintenance of PTSS and pain in women. Future research is needed to further clarify the role of sleep quality in their co-occurrence.",Evaluation of a Bystander-Focused Interpersonal Violence Prevention Program with High School Students.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30762156,Prevention science : the official journal of the Society for Prevention Research,2019 05 17,"This study evaluated the effectiveness of a seven-session, bystander-focused, classroom-delivered curriculum (i.e., Bringing in the Bystander-High School Curriculum [BITB-HSC]) in reducing rates of interpersonal violence among high school students.

In classrooms in treatment schools, students (n = 1081) completed a baseline survey, participated in the BITB-HSC, and completed an immediate post-test, a short-term post-test (approx. 2 months after intervention), and a long-term post-test (approx. 1 year after intervention). Youth in control schools (n = 1322) completed surveys at similar time points but did not participate in the BITB-HSC. Participants were 15.8 years old on average and largely White (85.1%) and heterosexual (84.5%). Students exposed to the BITB-HSC demonstrated significant short-term changes in victim empathy and bystander barriers/facilitators, and long-term changes in rape myths, media literacy, bystander readiness, and knowledge relative to youth in the control condition. Although the BITB-HSC had little long-term impact on actual bystander behavior, there were reductions in some forms of violence among students in the BITB-HSC condition relative to the control condition. Future research is needed to determine if, for whom, why, and in what contexts (e.g., classroom-based versus school-wide initiatives) bystander-focused violence prevention initiatives reduce violence."

The aims of the present study were to explore the ameliorative abilities of KFL on the depressive-like behaviors in a chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) mouse model, and to determine the potential mechanisms on oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and AKT/β-catenin signaling pathway. Three behavioral tests, sucrose preference test (SPT), social interaction test (SIT), and tail suspension test (TST), were used to evaluate the antidepressive effects of KFL in CSDS mice. Activity levels of antioxidant enzyme, superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), catalase (CAT), glutathione s-transferase (GST), and concentrations of malonaldehyde (MDA) and protein carbonylation in the prefrontal cortex were assessed by commercial kits, respectively. Elisa was used to detect the levels of interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α). Q-PCR was used to determine the mRNA level of CD-11b. Furthermore, activity level of AKT/β-catenin signaling in the prefrontal cortex of CSDS mice was investigated by western blot. In addition, LY294002, a PI3-K inhibitor, was used to investigate the role of AKT/β-catenin signaling in the antidepressant effects of KFL. Social defeat stress reduced the bodyweights, sucrose consumptions, social interaction times, and the tail suspension mobility times in mice. CSDS mice were also exhibited remarkablely increased levels in oxidative stress markers, inflammatory mediators, and decreased activity of AKT/β-catenin cascade in the prefrontal cortex, which were reversed by treatment with KFL. Interestingly, LY294002 appeared to partly inhibit the overall KFL-mediated protective effects in the CSDS mice. These results confirmed that KFL exerted antidepressive effects, which might be mediated, at least in part, by enhanced antioxidant abilities and anti-inflammation effects via up-regulation AKT/β-catenin cascade activity in the prefrontal cortex of CSDS mice. Thus, KFL might be a promising, effective, and safe food medicine for depression treatment.","Preterm Birth Is a Novel, Independent Risk Factor for Altered Cardiac Remodeling and Early Heart Failure: Is it Time for a New Cardiomyopathy?",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30762137,Current treatment options in cardiovascular medicine,2019 03 29,"Around 10% of the global population is born preterm (< 37 weeks' gestation).

Here we focus on some of the most common dementias: Alzheimer's disease, Parkinsonism dementias including Parkinson's disease with dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies, progressive supranuclear palsy and corticobasal syndrome, and frontotemporal lobe degeneration. PET tracers have been developed to target specific proteinopathies (amyloid, tau and α-synuclein), glucose metabolism, cholinergic system and neuroinflammation. Studies have shown distinct imaging abnormalities can be detected early, in some cases prior to symptom onset, allowing disease progression to be monitored and providing the potential to predict symptom onset. Furthermore, advances in PET imaging have identified potential therapeutic targets and novel methods to accurately discriminate between different types of dementias in vivo.

NOX and SOX in the form of air pollution are both triggers and sources of vegetation health that can have an effect on the local or the global level and whose impacts need to be monitored. In this study, the growth patterns in Scots pines (Pinus sylvestris L.) were studied in the context of changing atmospheric depositions in the lowlands of north-eastern Germany. Under the influence of atmospheric sulfur (S) and nitrogen (N) depositions, pine stands showed temporal variations in their normal growth behavior. In such cases, the patterns of normal growth can be suppressed or accelerated. Pine stands which were influenced by high S deposition up until 1990 changed from suppressed growth to accelerated growth by decreasing S, but increasing N depositions between 1990 and 2003. The cause of these changes in pine growth patterns was imbalances in S and N nutrition, in particular, enrichments of sulfate, non-protein nitrogen or arginine, and finally, also imbalances and deficiencies in phosphorus, glucose, and adenosine triphosphate in the needles. Our long-term monitoring study shows that biochemical markers (traits) are crucial bioindicators for the qualitative and quantitative assessment of tree vitality and growth patterns in Scots pines. Furthermore, we were able to show that NOX and SOX depositions need to be monitored locally to be able to assess the local effects of biomolecular markers on the growth patterns in Scots pine stands.",Tethering QK peptide to enhance angiogenesis in elastin-like recombinamer (ELR) hydrogels.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30762134,Journal of materials science. Materials in medicine,2019 06 13,"The development of new capillary networks in engineered constructs is essential for their survival and their integration with the host tissue. It has recently been demonstrated that ELR-based hydrogels encoding different bioactivities are able to modulate their interaction with the host after injection or implantation, as indicated by an increase in cell adhesion and the ability to trigger vascularization processes. Accordingly, the aim of this study was to increase their angiogenic ability both in vitro and in vivo using a small VEGF mimetic peptide named QK, which was tethered chemically to ELR-based hydrogels containing cell-adhesion sequences in their backbone, such as REDV and RGD, as well as a proteolytic site (VGVAPG). In vitro studies were performed using a co-culture of endothelial and fibroblast cells encapsulated into the ELR-based hydrogels in order to determine cell proliferation after 21 days of culture, as well as the number of cell-cell interactions. It was found that although the presence of this peptide does not influence the morphological and rheological properties of these hydrogels, it has an effect on cell behaviour, inducing an increase in cell proliferation and the formation of endothelial cell clusters. In vivo studies demonstrate that the QK peptide enhances the formation of prominent functional capillaries at three weeks post-injection, as confirmed by H&E staining and CD31 immunohistochemistry. The newly formed functional microvasculature ensures perfusion and connection with surrounding tissues. These results show that ELR-QK hydrogels increase capillary network formation and are therefore attractive candidates for application in tissue regeneration, for example for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases such as myocardial infarction or ischemia.",Genotoxic activity of L-asparaginase produced by Streptomyces ansochromogenes UFPEDA 3420.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30762133,World journal of microbiology & biotechnology,2019 05 04,"L-asparaginase is an enzyme capable of hydrolyzing the substrate asparagine in aspartic acid and ammonia. Due to this mechanism of action observed, L-asparaginase is widely used in the treatment of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia, since these cells use asparagine for their survival. Because it is frequently used as an antineoplastic, it is necessary to evaluate its genotoxic effects. The aim of the present study was to evaluate cellular DNA damage after exposure to L-asparaginase produced by Streptomyces ansochromogenes UFPEDA 3420. NCIH-292, MCF-7 and MOLT-4 neoplastic cell lines and normal PBMC cells were used. L-Asparaginase used in this study was produced by actinobacteria S. ansochromogenes UFPEDA 3420, isolated and purified by chromatographic methods. L-Asparaginase induced micronucleus formation in PBMC cells and tumor lines when compared to the negative control. These data suggest that L-Asp appears to have a genotoxic effect very close to the positive control in normal cells (p < 0.05). The level of genomic damage measured by DNA breaks in alkaline SCGE assay was detected from the lowest concentration (12.5 µg/mL) to the highest concentration (50 µg/mL) for tumor cell lines and PBMC. In view of the above, new genotoxic studies will be carried out to better elucidate L-Asparaginase and its mutagenic potential, still unknown, enough for this drug to be safely used in conventional antineoplastic therapies.",Revealing solvent-dependent folding behavior of mycolic acids from Mycobacterium tuberculosis by advanced simulation analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30762132,Journal of molecular modeling,2019 02 19,"Mycobacterium tuberculosis remains a persistent pathogen, partly due to its lipid rich cell wall, of which mycolic acids (MAs) are a major component. The fluidity and conformational flexibilities of different MAs in the bacterial cell wall significantly influence its properties, function, and observed pathogenicity; thus, a proper conformational description of different MAs in different environments (e.g., in vacuum, in solution, in monolayers) can inform about their potential role in the complex setup of the bacterial cell wall. Previously, we have shown that molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of MA folding in vacuo can be used to characterize MA conformers in seven groupings relating to bending at the functional groups (W, U and Z-conformations). Providing a new OPLS-based forcefield parameterization for the critical cyclopropyl group of MAs and extensive simulations in explicit solvents (TIP4P water, hexane), we now present a more complete picture of MA folding properties together with improved simulation analysis techniques. We show that the 'WUZ' distance-based analysis can be used to pinpoint conformers with hairpin bends at the functional groups, with these conformers constituting only a fraction of accessible conformations. Applying principle component analysis (PCA) and refinement using free energy landscapes (FELs), we are able to discriminate a complete and unique set of conformational preferences for representative alpha-, methoxy- and keto-MAs, with overall preference for folded conformations. A control backbone-MA without any mero-chain functional groups showed significantly less folding in the mero-chain, confirming the role of functionalization in directing folding. Keto-MA showed the highest percentage of WUZ-type conformations and, in particular, a tendency to fold at its alpha-methyl trans-cyclopropane group, in agreement with results from Villeneuve et al. MAs demonstrate similar folding in vacuum and water, with a majority of folded conformations around the W-conformation, although the molecules are more flexible in vacuum than in water. Exchange between conformations, with a disperse distribution that includes unfolded conformers, is common in hexane for all MAs, although with more organization for Keto-MA. Globular, folded conformations are newly defined and may be specifically relevant in biofilms.

To date, only Japan has given regulatory approval to salvage nivolumab in chemo-refractory mesothelioma patients. The USA has included in the NCCN guidelines that pembrolizumab (in programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) immunohistochemistry (IHC)-positive patients) and nivolumab with or without ipilimumab (whatever the PD-L1 status is) are accepted salvage therapies. Based on the growing body of literature, it is anticipated that checkpoint inhibitors will receive regulatory approval in the USA and Europe soon for salvage therapy. Additional research efforts will determine whether earlier stage patients and frontline unresectable patients will benefit from the addition of immunotherapy to their treatment regimens. The realm of biomarker research has lagged behind in mesothelioma. In general, mesothelioma has less tumor mutation burden than other malignancies. Most of the single-agent salvage checkpoint inhibitor trials have shown a trend correlating higher PD-L1 immunohistochemistry (IHC) with responses.

Materials in medicine,2019 06 13,"The effect of doubling the immersion fluid (eluate) volume on antibiotic concentrations and on mechanical stability from vancomycin and gentamicin loaded bone cements was investigated in vitro. Antibiotic loaded bone cements containing premixed 1.34% gentamicin antibiotic concentration in the cement powder (wt), premixed 1.19% gentamicin wt and 4.76% vancomycin wt and premixed 1.17% wt gentamicin additionally manually blended with 4.68% wt vancomycin were tested. Six specimens per group were immersed in 4 ml and 8 ml for 6 weeks while the eluate was exchanged every 24 h. The antibiotic concentrations were repeatedly measured. Then the specimens were tested for compressive strength. Doubling the eluate volume significantly decreased gentamicin and vancomycin concentrations from 6 h and 24 h on, except for the gentamicin concentration of the additionally manually blended formulation after 3 weeks. The additionally manually blended vancomycin formulation produced significantly higher gentamicin concentrations in 8 ml compared to the other formulations. The reduction ratios of the vancomycin concentrations were significantly smaller than the reduction ratios of the gentamicin concentrations for the manually blended vancomycin formulation. Vancomycin containing formulations showed significantly lower compressive strengths than the vancomycin free formulation after immersion. Doubling the eluate volume lead to significant compressive strength reduction of the vancomycin containing formulations. Eluate volume change influences antibiotic elution dependent on the antibiotic combination and loading technique. The reducing effect is higher on vancomycin than on gentamicin elution. Compressive strength of gentamicin/vancomycin loaded bone cements after immersion is eluate volume dependent.",A DFT-based study of the hydrogen-bonding interactions between myricetin and ethanol/water.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30762117,Journal of molecular modeling,2019 02 19,"Flavonoids are vital constituents of propolis that are responsible for its medicinal activity. Flavonoid extraction commonly employs ethanol and water as solvents. In the extraction reaction, hydrogen-bonding interactions play a crucial role. In this study, hydrogen-bonding interactions between myricetin-an abundant flavonoid in propolis-and ethanol or water were studied theoretically using density functional theory (DFT) methods. The molecular geometry and charge properties of the myricetin monomer were analyzed first. After careful optimization, nine stable myricetin-CH3CH2OH/H2O complex geometries were obtained. Hydrogen bonds were confirmed to exist in these optimized structures. The most stable structures were found to be those with hydrogen bonds involving the hydrogen atoms of hydroxyl groups and the oxygen atom of the keto group of myricetin. The characteristics of the hydrogen-bonding interactions in the optimized structures were carefully analyzed. The hydrogen bonds in the optimized geometries were shown to be closed-shell-type interactions. H5' in ring B of myricetin presented the strongest interaction. The hydrogen bonds were found to be Coulombic interactions. Those between the hydrogen atoms of the hydroxyl groups in myricetin and the oxygen atoms in CH3CH2OH and H2O were of moderate strength and had some covalent character, while the others were weak and were dominantly electrostatic in character.",Skeletal disproportion in glucocorticoid-treated boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30762116,European journal of pediatrics,2019 05 05,"We aimed to compare body segment and bone lengths in glucocorticoid-treated boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) with healthy controls using dual-energy absorptiometry (DXA) images. Total height (Ht), sitting height (SH), leg length (LL) and bone lengths (femur, tibia) in boys with DMD and age-matched control boys were measured using DXA. Thirty boys with DMD (median age 10.0 years (6.1, 16.8)) were compared with 30 controls. SH in DMD was 3.3 cm lower (95% CI - 6.1, - 0.66; p = 0.016). LL in DMD was 7.3 cm lower (95% CI - 11.2, - 3.4; p < 0.0001). SH:LL of boys with DMD was higher by 0.08 (95% CI 0.04, 0.12; p < 0.0001). Femur length in DMD was 2.4 cm lower (95% CI - 4.6, - 0.12; p = 0.04), whereas tibial length in DMD was 4.8 cm lower (95% CI - 6.7, - 2.9; p < 0.0001). SH:LL was not associated with duration of glucocorticoid use (SH:LL β = 0.003, 95% CI - 0.01 to 0.002, p = 0.72).Conclusion: Glucocorticoid-treated boys with DMD exhibit skeletal disproportion with relatively shorter leg length and more marked reduction of distal long bones. As glucocorticoid excess is not associated with such disproportion, our findings raise the possibility of an intrinsic disorder of growth in DMD. What is Known • Severe growth impairment and short stature are commonly observed in boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), especially those treated with long-term glucocorticoids (GC). • In other groups of children with chronic conditions and/or disorders of puberty, skeletal disproportion with lower spinal length has been reported. What is New • Growth impairment in GC-treated boys with DMD was associated with skeletal disproportion in relation to age, with lower limbs and distal long bones affected to a greater degree.",CO2 adsorption in nitrogen-doped single-layered graphene quantum dots: a spectroscopic investigation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30762115,Journal of molecular modeling,2019 02 19,"In this work, we investigate the adsorption process of CO2 in graphene quantum dots from the electronic structure and spectroscopic properties point of view.

We compare interannual strain frequencies along a geographical region for understanding the forces that shape Wolbachia strain frequency in natural populations of its host, Chorthippus parallelus (Orthoptera, Acrididae). General linear models show that strain frequency changes significantly across geographical and temporal scales. Computer simulation allows to reject the compatibility of the observed patterns with either genetic drift or sampling errors. We use consecutive years to estimate total Wolbachia strain fitness. Our estimation of Wolbachia fitness is significant in most cases, within locality and between consecutive years, following a negatively frequency-dependent trend. Wolbachia spp. B and F strains show a temporal pattern of variation that is compatible with a negative frequency-dependent natural selection mechanism. Our results suggest that such a mechanism should be at least considered in future experimental and theoretical research strategies that attempt to understand Wolbachia biodiversity.",Liraglutide suppresses atrial electrophysiological changes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30762094,Heart and vessels,2019 02 14,"We have shown that a dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitor suppresses atrial remodeling in a canine atrial fibrillation (AF) model. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is increased by DPP-4 inhibitors. However, it is not clear whether GLP-1 is involved in the suppression of atrial remodeling. In this study, we evaluated the effect of liraglutide (a GLP-1 analog) on atrial electrophysiological changes using the same canine AF model. We established a canine AF model using continuous 3-week rapid atrial stimulation in seven beagle dogs divided into two groups: a liraglutide group with four dogs (3-week atrial pacing with liraglutide (150 µg/kg/day) administration) and a pacing control group with three dogs (3-week pacing without any medicine). We evaluated the atrial effective refractory period (AERP), conduction velocity (CV), and AF inducibility every week during the protocol using implanted epicardial wires against the surfaces of both atria. In the pacing control group, the AERP was gradually shortened and the CV was decreased along the time course. In the liraglutide group, the AERP was similarly shortened as in the pacing control group (94 ± 4% versus 85 ± 2%, respectively; p = 0.5926), but the CV became significantly higher than that in the pacing control group after 2 and 3 weeks (95 ± 4 versus 83 ± 5%, respectively; p = 0.0339).

Our analysis is based on (1) the critical regularization strength to restore symmetry breaking in the recently developed regularized orbital optimized second-order Møller-Plesset perturbation theory (κ-OOMP2), (2) singlet-triplet gaps from various MP2 methods, and (3) natural orbital occupation numbers from restricted coupled-cluster with singles and doubles (RCCSD) and coupled-cluster valence bond with singles and doubles (CCVB-SD). Based on these three independent probes, we conclude that C36 (D6h) exhibits genuine strong correlation and symmetry breaking whereas C60 exhibits artificial HF symmetry breaking and is not strongly correlated. Investigating the critical regularization strength, we discuss strong correlation in C20 at the Jahn-Teller distorted geometries (C2h, D2h, Ci, and D3h) and the Ih geometry. Only C20 (Ih) was found to be strongly correlated while others exhibit artificial HF symmetry breaking. This analysis highlights a useful feature of the recommended κ-OOMP2 method. It is an electronic structure method that describes dynamic correlation, and attenuates strong correlation in MP2 towards zero by regularization. Therefore, κ-OOMP2 will exhibit symmetry breaking in its reference determinant only when correlation is strong (i.e., essential symmetry breaking). Artificial symmetry breaking (arising in HF due to neglect of dynamic correlation) thus appears to be removed in κ-OOMP2.","Solvent-free anhydrous Li+, Na+ and K+ salts of [B(3,5-(CF3)2C6H3)4]-, [BArF4]-.

The entropy production rate is found to increase during the spinodal decomposition stage and to decrease during the domain growth stage, attaining its maximum at the crossover between the two. Such behaviour provides a natural criterion to identify and discriminate between the two regimes. Furthermore, the effects of heat conductivity, viscosity and surface tension on the entropy production rate are investigated by systematically probing the interplay between non-equilibrium energy and momentum fluxes. It is found that the entropy production rate due to energy fluxes is an increasing function of the Prandtl number, while the momentum fluxes exhibit an opposite trend. On the other hand, both contributions show an increasing trend with surface tension. The present analysis inscribes within the general framework of non-equilibrium thermodynamics and consequently it is expected to be relevant to a broad class of soft-flowing systems far from mechanical and thermal equilibrium."

Herein, we conjugated zinc(ii) monoamino phthalocyanine (ZnMAPc) to poly(glycidyl methacrylate) (PGMA) via a ring-opening reaction, and the excess epoxy groups were scavenged by ethylenediamine (ED). The resultant macro-photosensitizer (PGED-Pc) can be easily dispersed in aqueous solution to form self-assembled nanoparticles and generate reactive oxygen species for inactivation of bacteria when exposed to light illumination. We found that the photodynamic pathway for the generation of singlet oxygen (1O2) was strongly inhibited in aqueous solution, and the major components for the inactivation of bacteria were superoxide anion radicals (˙O2-) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), which could result in the disruption of bacterial envelopes, the inactivation of vital enzymes, and the degradation of genomic DNA. PGED-Pc exhibited potent photodynamic antibacterial activity, with minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC, defined as 99.9% inactivation of bacteria) values of 128 μg mL-1 for Escherichia coli (E. coli) and 4 μg mL-1 for Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus). As a proof-of-concept, the PGED-Pc nano-assemblies in aqueous solution can be readily immobilized on glass slides via a Schiff-base reaction, and impose potent photodynamic antibacterial activity upon light illumination.

We tested the performance of DLPNO-MkCCSD(T) in calculations involving tetramethyleneethane and isomers of naphthynes. These tests show that more than 97% of triples energy was recovered with respect to the canonical MkCCSD(T) method, which together with the DLPNO-MkCCSD part accounts for about 99.70-99.85% of the total correlation energy. The applicability of the method was demonstrated on calculations of singlet-triplet gaps for several large systems: triangulene, dynemicin A, and a beryllium complex.",The cone-tetranitrocalix[4]arene tetraradical tetraanion as an electrochemically generated ligand for heavier alkali metal cations.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30762043,"Chemical communications (Cambridge, England)",2019 03 04,"Four-electron electrochemical reduction of the cone-tetranitrocalix[4]arene in DMF results in the stable tetraradical tetraanion.

This defect rich compound has at least partially square planar coordination of the Co2+ ions, a highly unusual coordination environment for Co. Low temperature neutron powder diffraction showed a G-type antiferromagnetic ordering, confirmed by SQUID magnetic measurements, which indicate a high Néel temperature of 220 K.

It is challenging to extract the influence of each individual factor, as small changes in the molecular structure often dramatically change the crystal packing and hence solid-state structure. Here, we use calculations to explore the influence of the nitrogen position on the charge mobility of a chiral organic molecule when the crystal packing is kept constant. The transfer integrals for a series of enantiopure aza[6]helicene crystals sharing the same packing were analysed in order to identify the best supramolecular motifs to promote charge carrier mobility. The regioisomers considered differ only in the positioning of the nitrogen atom in the aromatic scaffold. The simulations showed that even this small change in the chemical structure has a strong effect on the charge transport in the crystal, leading to differences in charge mobility of up to one order of magnitude. Some aza[6]helicene isomers that were packed interlocked with each other showed high HOMO-HOMO integrals (up to 70 meV), whilst molecules arranged with translational symmetry generally afforded the highest LUMO-LUMO integrals (40-70 meV). As many of the results are not intuitively obvious, a computational approach provides additional insight into the design of new semiconducting organic materials.",Harnessing the layer-by-layer assembly technique to design biomaterials vaccines for immune modulation in translational applications.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30762040,Biomaterials science,2019 06 14,"The existence of challenging diseases such as cancers, HIV and Zika requires developing new vaccines that can generate tunable and robust immune responses against the diseases. Biomaterials-based techniques have been broadly explored for designing vaccines that can produce controllable and potent immunity. Among the existing biomaterials-based strategies, the layer-by-layer (LbL) assembly technique is remarkably attractive in vaccine design due to its unique features such as programmed and versatile cargo loading, cargo protection, co-delivery, juxtaposing of immune signals, etc. In this work, we reviewed the existing LbL-based vaccine design techniques for translational applications. Specifically, we discussed nanovaccines constructed by coating polyelectrolyte multilayers (PEMs) on nanoparticles, microcapsule vaccines assembled from PEMs, polyplex/complex vaccines condensed from charged materials and microneedle vaccines deposited with PEMs, highlighting the employment of these techniques to promote immunity against diseases ranging from cancers to infectious and autoimmune diseases (i.e., HIV, influenza, multiple sclerosis, etc.). Additionally, the review specifically emphasized using LbL-based vaccine technologies for tuning the cellular and molecular pathways, demonstrating the unique advantages presented by these vaccination strategies. These studies showed the versatility and potency of using LbL-based techniques for designing the next generation of biomaterials vaccines for translational purposes.",Dissociative photoionization of CF3Cl via the C2E and D2E states: competition of the C-F and C-Cl bond cleavages.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30762039,Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP,2019 02 28,"The dissociative photoionization of CF3Cl was investigated using threshold photoelectron photoion coincidence (TPEPICO) imaging in the energy range of 12.30-18.50 eV. The coincident time-of-flight mass spectra and three-dimensional time-sliced images of the CF2Cl+ fragment were recorded at a few specific photon energies. Two fragmentation pathways were observed that led to the breakage of the C-Cl and C-F bonds, while the branching ratio elicited an energy-dependent relationship. The CF3+ fragment was dominant in the dissociation of the X2E, A2A' and B2A'' states, while CF2Cl+ became the predominant fragment and its branching ratio remained constant in the energy range associated with the C2E and D2E states. Based on the inflection point in the energy-dependent curve of the fragment branching ratios, the adiabatic ionization energy (IEa) of C2E is suggested to be 15.46 eV. Although the excess energy increased considerably from C2E to D2E, the kinetic energy release distributions (KERDs) of CF2Cl+ were similar. Moreover, the anisotropy parameters β for the F-loss channel were positive and larger than those for the Cl-loss channel. The calculated F-loss potential energy curves of CF3Cl+ suggested that for the C2E and D2E states, the C-F bond rupture occurred via the internal conversion to the A2A' state followed by the dissociation attributed to the crossing of the barrier along the C-F coordinate. Based on the experimental and theoretical conclusions, the internal conversion is the rate-determining step in the dissociative photoionization of CF3Cl via the C2E and D2E ionic states, irrespective of whether the C-F and C-Cl bonds rupture.","Decomposition of the electronic activity in competing [5,6] and [6,6] cycloaddition reactions between C60 and cyclopentadiene.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30762038,Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP,2019 02 28,"Fullerenes, in particular C60, are important molecular entities in many areas, ranging from material science to medicinal chemistry. However, chemical transformations have to be done in order to transform C60 in added-value compounds with increased applicability. The most common procedure corresponds to the classical Diels-Alder cycloaddition reaction. In this research, a comprehensive study of the electronic activity that takes place in the cycloaddition between C60 and cyclopentadiene toward the [5,6] and [6,6] reaction pathways is presented. These are competitive reaction mechanisms dominated by σ and π fluctuating activity. To better understand the electronic activity at each stage of the mechanism, the reaction force (RF) and the symmetry-adapted reaction electronic flux (SA-REF, JΓi(ξ)) have been used to elucidate whether π or σ bonding changes drive the reaction. Since the studied cycloaddition reaction proceeds through a Cs symmetry reaction path, two SA-REF emerge: JA'(ξ) and JA''(ξ). In particular, JA'(ξ) mainly accounts for bond transformations associated with π bonds, while JA''(ξ) is sensitive toward σ bonding changes. It was found that the [6,6] path is highly favored over the [5,6] with respect to activation energies. This difference is primarily due to the less intensive electronic reordering of the σ electrons in the [6,6] path, as a result of the pyramidalization of carbon atoms in C60 (sp2 → sp3 transition). Interestingly, no substantial differences in the π electronic activity from the reactant complex to the transition state structure were found when comparing the [5,6] and [6,6] paths. Partition of the kinetic energy into its symmetry contributions indicates that when a bond is being weakened/broken (formed/strengthened) non-spontaneous (spontaneous) changes in the electronic activity occur, thus prompting an increase (decrease) of the kinetic energy. Therefore, contraction (expansion) of the electronic density in the vicinity of the bonding change is expected to take place.",Stereospecific polymerization of conjugated dienes using neodymium alkylborohydride complexes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30762037,"Dalton transactions (Cambridge, England : 2003)",2019 05 28,"Two neodymium alkylborohydride complexes that differ with respect to the number of hydrides on the boron center were synthesized and characterized. The μ2-ligated complex exhibits Nd-B bond lengths that are approximately 10% longer than those in previously reported μ3-ligated borohydride complexes. For the μ3-alkylborohydride complex, the Nd-H-B stretching bands observed by IR spectroscopy suggested stronger borohydride coordination than that of [BH4]-, which is probably due to the electron donation of the alkyl groups. These newly prepared complexes successfully promoted trans-1,4 specific polymerization of conjugate dienes upon activation by Bu2Mg, whereas activation of these complexes by Bu2Mg/MMAO gave cis-1,4 regular polymer. The trans-1,4 defect of the polyisoprene obtained from the Nd μ2-alkylborohydride complex/Bu2Mg/MMAO system (<2%) was much lower than that obtained from previously reported μ3-BH4-ligated neodymium complex (11%). Moreover, μ2-alkylborohydride complex was a good initiator for the polymerization of MMA, probably because of its anionic nature.",Co3O4-nanoparticle-entrapped nitrogen and boron codoped mesoporous carbon as an efficient electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30762036,"Dalton transactions (Cambridge, England : 2003)",2019 05 28,"Co3O4-nanoparticle-entrapped nitrogen and boron codoped mesoporous carbon was synthesized via the molten salt method. Melamine formaldehyde resin (MF resin) was used as the nitrogen and carbon precursor, and boric acid was utilized as the boron precursor. Furthermore, cobalt chloride was used as the cobalt precursor and the template for the formation of mesopores, which could also be removed and partly recovered by acid washing. The characterization results revealed that the as-obtained samples possessed mesoporous structures, with high cobalt, boron, and nitrogen content values. For the sample of Co0.65B0.3NC800, the atomic content values of Co, N, and B are 2.3%, 8.87%, and 8.67%, respectively. Moreover, the carbonation temperature and the amount of salt template could both affect the mesoporous structures of the final samples and then affect the electrocatalytic activities for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). When the carbonation temperature was 800 °C, the sample of Co0.65B0.3NC800 showed superior performance for the HER under basic conditions, with high current density, low overpotential, and good stability."

Indeed, the expression of genes associated with regeneration, including neurotrophic and gliotrophic factors, is drastically reduced in the distal stump of chronically transected nerves; moreover, Schwann cells undergo atrophy, losing their ability to sustain regeneration. In the present study, to provide a three-dimensional environment and trophic factors supporting Schwann cell activity and axon re-growth, we combined the use of an effective conduit (a chitosan tube) with a promising intraluminal structure (fresh longitudinal skeletal muscle fibers). This enriched conduit was used to repair a 10-mm rat median nerve gap after 3-month delay and functional and morphometrical analyses were performed 4 months after nerve reconstruction. Our data show that the enriched chitosan conduit is as effective as the hollow chitosan conduit in promoting nerve regeneration, and its efficacy is not statistically different from the autograft, considered the ""gold standard"" technique for nerve reconstruction. Since hollow tubes not always lead to good results after long defects (> 20 mm), we believe that the conduit enriched with fresh muscle fibers could be a promising strategy to repair longer gaps, as muscle fibers create a favorable three-dimensional environment and release trophic factors.

However, no satisfactory treatment is currently available. Hypoxia-inducible factor 1α is a critical molecule targeting several genes associated with ischemia-hypoxia damage and angiogenesis. In this study, a rat model of brachial plexus avulsion-reimplantation was established, in which C5-7 ventral nerve roots were avulsed and only the C6 root reimplanted. Different implants were immediately injected using a microsyringe into the avulsion-reimplantation site of the C6 root post-brachial plexus avulsion. Rats were randomly divided into five groups: phosphate-buffered saline, negative control of lentivirus, hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (hypoxia-inducible factor 1α overexpression lentivirus), gel (pluronic F-127 hydrogel), and gel + hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (pluronic F-127 hydrogel + hypoxia-inducible factor 1α overexpression lentivirus). The Terzis grooming test was performed to assess recovery of motor function. Scores were higher in the hypoxia-inducible factor 1α and gel + hypoxia-inducible factor 1α groups (in particular the gel + hypoxia-inducible factor 1α group) compared with the phosphate-buffered saline group. Electrophysiology, fluorogold retrograde tracing, and immunofluorescent staining were further performed to investigate neural pathway reconstruction and changes of neurons, motor endplates, and angiogenesis. Compared with the phosphate-buffered saline group, action potential latency of musculocutaneous nerves was markedly shortened in the hypoxia-inducible factor 1α and gel + hypoxia-inducible factor 1α groups. Meanwhile, the number of fluorogold-positive cells and ChAT-positive neurons, neovascular area (labeled by CD31 around avulsed sites in ipsilateral spinal cord segments), and the number of motor endplates in biceps brachii (identified by α-bungarotoxin) were all visibly increased, as well as the morphology of motor endplate in biceps brachil was clear in the hypoxia-inducible factor 1α and gel + hypoxia-inducible factor 1α groups.

In recent years, several research groups are trying to find an effective therapy that could be applied in clinical practice. In this study, we analyzed the combination of different strategies as a potential therapy for spinal cord injury. Immunization with neural derived peptides (INDP), inhibition of glial scar formation (dipyridyl: DPY), as well as the use of biocompatible matrix (fibrin glue: FG) impregnated with bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were combined and then its beneficial effects were evaluated in the induction of neuroprotection and neuroregeneration after acute SCI. Sprague-Dawley female rats were subjected to a moderate spinal cord injury and then randomly allocated into five groups: 1) phosphate buffered saline; 2) DPY; 3) INDP + DPY; 4) DPY+ FG; 5) INDP + DPY + FG + MSCs. In all rats, intervention was performed 72 hours after spinal cord injury. Locomotor and sensibility recovery was assessed in all rats. At 60 days after treatment, histological examinations of the spinal cord (hematoxylin-eosin and Bielschowsky staining) were performed. Our results showed that the combination therapy (DPY+ INDP + FG + MSCs) was the best strategy to promote motor and sensibility recovery. In addition, significant increases in tissue preservation and axonal density were observed in the combination therapy group. Findings from this study suggest that the combination theapy (DPY+ INDP + FG + MSCs) exhibits potential effects on the protection and regeneration of neural tissue after acute spinal cord injury.

Schwann cells in peripheral nerves receive molecular signals from axons to coordinate the process of myelination. There is evidence, however, that non-molecular signals play an important role in myelination in the form of patterned electrical impulses generated by neuronal activity. The role of patterned electrical impulses has been investigated in the literature using co-cultures of neurons and myelinating cells. The co-culturing method, however, prevents the uncoupling of the direct effect of patterned electrical impulses on myelinating cells from the indirect effect mediated by neurons. To uncouple these effects and focus on the direct response of Schwann cells, we developed an in vitro model where an electroconductive carbon fiber acts as an artificial axon. The fiber provides only the biophysical characteristics of an axon but does not contribute any molecular signaling. In our ""suspended wire model"", the carbon fiber is suspended in a liquid media supported by a 3D printed scaffold. Patterned electrical impulses are generated by an Arduino 101 microcontroller. In this study, we describe the technology needed to set-up and eventually replicate this model. We also report on our initial in vitro tests where we were able to document the adherence and ensheath of human Schwann cells to the carbon fiber in the presence of patterned electrical impulses (hSCs were purchased from ScienCell Research Laboratories, Carlsbad, CA, USA; ScienCell fulfills the ethic requirements, including donor's consent). This technology will likely make feasible to investigate the response of Schwann cells to patterned electrical impulses in the future.",Rapid transport of insulin to the brain following intranasal administration in rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30762017,Neural regeneration research,2019 06 10,"We previously reported that intranasal insulin protects substantia nigra dopaminergic neurons against 6-hydroxydopamine neurotoxicity in rats. This study aimed to assess insulin pharmacokinetics in the rat brain following intranasal application. Recombinant human insulin (rh-Ins) or phosphate buffer solution was administered to both nostrils of rats. Animals were sacrificed at 15 minutes, 1, 2, and 6 hours to determine insulin levels in different brain regions by an ultrasensitive, human-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit. For fluorescence tracing study, rats were administered with intranasal florescence-tagged insulin (Alex546-Ins), and brains were fixed at 10 and 30 minutes to prepare sagittal sections. rh-Ins was detected in all brain regions examined except the cerebral cortex. The highest levels were detected in the brainstem, followed by the cerebellum, substantia nigra/ventral tegmental area, olfactory bulb, striatum, hippocampus, and thalamus/hypothalamus. Insulin levels reached a peak at 15 minutes and then declined gradually overtime, but remained significantly higher than baseline levels at 6 hours in most regions. Consistently, widespread Alex546-Ins-binding cells were detected in the brain at 10 and 30 minutes, with the olfactory bulb and brainstem showing the highest while the cerebral cortex showing lowest fluorescence signals. Double-immunostaining showed that Alex546-Ins-bindings were primarily co-localized with neuronal nuclei-positive neurons. In the subtantia nigra, phospho-Akt was found to be activated in a subset of Alex546-Ins and tyrosine hydroxylase double-labeled cells, suggesting activation of the Akt/PI3K pathway in these dopaminergic neurons. Data from this study suggest that intranasal insulin could effectively reach deep brain structures including the nigrostriatal pathways, where it binds to dopaminergic neurons and activates intracellular cell survival signaling.

However, the mechanisms by which synaptic dysfunction contributes to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease remain unclear. In the present study, Alzheimer's disease transgenic mice were used to determine the relationship between decreased hippocampal synaptic plasticity and pathological changes and cognitive-behavioral deterioration, as well as possible mechanisms underlying decreased synaptic plasticity in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease-like diseases. APP/PS1 double transgenic (5XFAD; Jackson Laboratory) mice and their littermates (wild-type, controls) were used in this study. Additional 6-week-old and 10-week-old 5XFAD mice and wild-type mice were used for electrophysiological recording of hippocampal dentate gyrus. For 10-week-old 5XFAD mice and wild-type mice, the left hippocampus was used for electrophysiological recording, and the right hippocampus was used for biochemical experiments or immunohistochemical staining to observe synaptophysin levels and amyloid beta deposition levels. The results revealed that, compared with wild-type mice, 6-week-old 5XFAD mice exhibited unaltered long-term potentiation in the hippocampal dentate gyrus. Another set of 5XFAD mice began to show attenuation at the age of 10 weeks, and a large quantity of amyloid beta protein was accumulated in hippocampal cells. The location of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid receptor and N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor subunits in synaptosomes was decreased. These findings indicate that the delocalization of postsynaptic glutamate receptors and an associated decline in synaptic plasticity may be key mechanisms in the early onset of Alzheimer's disease.

These tonic currents can be enhanced by low-dose isoflurane, which is associated with learning and memory impairment. Inverse agonists of α5 GABAARs, such as L-655,708, are able to reverse the short-term memory deficit caused by low-dose isoflurane in young animals. However, whether these negative allosteric modulators have the same effects on aged rats remains unclear. In the present study, we mainly investigated the effects of L-655,708 on low-dose (1.3%) isoflurane-induced learning and memory impairment in elderly rats. Young (3-month-old) and aged (24-month-old) Wistar rats were randomly assigned to receive L-655,708 0.5 hour before or 23.5 hours after 1.3% isoflurane anesthesia. The Morris Water Maze tests demonstrated that L-655,708 injected before or after anesthesia could reverse the memory deficit in young rats. But in aged rats, application of L-655,708 only before anesthesia showed similar effects. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction showed that low-dose isoflurane decreased the mRNA expression of α5 GABAARs in aging hippocampal neurons but increased that in young animals. These findings indicate that L-655,708 prevented but could not reverse 1.3% isoflurane-induced spatial learning and memory impairment in aged Wistar rats.

In the first dorsal interosseous and wrist extensors muscles, the median amplitudes of the ipsilateral motor evoked potentials induced by transcranial magnetic stimulation in the patient were higher than those of 10 age-matched healthy control subjects. In the biceps brachii muscle, the median amplitudes of the ipsilateral motor evoked potentials were the second largest in the patient compared to the controls.

However, the inflammatory response mediated by the Wnt/Frizzled signaling pathway in experimental subarachnoid hemorrhage has not been thoroughly investigated. Consequently, in this study, we examined the potential role of the Wnt/Frizzled signaling pathway in early brain injury in rat models of subarachnoid hemorrhage. Simultaneously, possible neuroprotective mechanisms were also investigated. Experimental subarachnoid hemorrhage rat models were induced by injecting autologous blood into the prechiasmatic cistern. Experiment 1 was designed to examine expression of the Wnt/Frizzled signaling pathway in early brain injury induced by subarachnoid hemorrhage. In total, 42 adult rats were divided into sham (injection of equivalent volume of saline), 6-, 12-, 24-, 48-, 72-hour, and 1-week subarachnoid hemorrhage groups.

Expression levels of Wnt1, Frizzled1, β-catenin, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ, CD36, and active nuclear factor-κB were examined by western blot assay and immunofluorescence staining. Microglia type conversion and inflammatory cytokine levels in brain tissue were examined by immunofluorescence staining and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Our results show that compared with the sham group, expression levels of Wnt1, Frizzled1, and β-catenin were low and reduced to a minimum at 48 hours, gradually returning to baseline at 1 week after subarachnoid hemorrhage. rhwnt1 treatment markedly increased Wnt1 expression and alleviated subarachnoid hemorrhage-induced early brain injury (within 72 hours), including cortical cell apoptosis, brain edema, and neurobehavioral deficits, accompanied by increasing protein levels of β-catenin, CD36, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ and decreasing protein levels of nuclear factor-κB. Of note, rhwnt1 promoted M2-type microglia conversion and inhibited release of inflammatory cytokines (interleukin-1β, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α). In contrast, siwnt1 RNA and anti-Frizzled1 treatment both resulted in an opposite effect. In conclusion, the Wnt/Frizzled1 signaling pathway may participate in subarachnoid hemorrhage-induced early brain injury via inhibiting the inflammatory response, including regulating microglia type conversion and decreasing inflammatory cytokine release. The study was approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of Anhui Medical University and First Affiliated Hospital of USTC, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of China (approval No. LLSC-20180202) in May 2017."

Hospitalized patients serologically positive for Rickettsia typhi by indirect immunofluorescence antibody assay during 2006-2016 were retrospectively identified. Clinical and laboratory data from patients' charts were used to analyze disease trends and distribution. Seventy-eight patients were studied (mean age: 27.9 years), mostly of Arab ethnicity (68, 87.2%). Seventy-one (91%) patients resided in two large mixed Jewish-Arab cities-Lod and Ramla. The incidence of murine typhus among the Arab population in Lod increased 8.4-fold from 6.4/100,000 in 2006 to a peak of 53.4/100,000 in 2013. The average annual incidence among Arabs in Ramla was 10.1/100,000. Among Jews, incidences were 0.8/100,000 in Lod and 0.4/100,000 in Ramla. The classical triad of fever, headache, and rash was noted in 20.8% patients. Substantial morbidity included prolonged fever before hospitalization and hospital stay (mean of 8.4 and 5.1 days, respectively), and severe complications in six patients, including pneumonitis in three patients, and splenic infarctions, pericardial effusion, and retinitis, each in one. One previously healthy patient died of multiorgan failure. The study describes a high incidence of murine typhus with a recent upsurge in an urban setting in central Israel.

Temporary residents with loiasis often display acute symptoms and hypereosinophilia, in contrast to a parasite-induced subclinical state in chronically infected ENDs. Few studies have examined differences in ENDs and TRs infected with the related filarial parasite Onchocerca volvulus. We identified 40 TRs and 36 ENDs with imported onchocerciasis at the National Institutes of Health between 1976 and 2016. All study subjects received an extensive pretreatment medical history, physical examination, and laboratory investigations. We performed additional parasite-specific serologic testing on stored patient sera. Asymptomatic infection occurred in 12.5% of TRs and no ENDs (P = 0.06). Papular dermatitis was more common in TRs (47.5% versus 2.7%, P < 0.001), whereas more pigmentation changes occurred in ENDs (41.7% versus 15%, P = 0.01). Only endemic patients reported visual disturbance (13% versus 0%, P = 0.03). One TR (3.3%) had onchocercal eye disease, compared with 22.6% of ENDs (P = 0.053). Absolute eosinophil counts (AECs) were similar in ENDs and TRs (P = 0.5), and one-third of subjects had a normal AEC. Endemic individuals had higher filarial-specific IgG4 and were more likely to be positive for IgG4 antibodies to Ov-16. Temporary residents and ENDs with imported O. volvulus infection presented with different dermatologic manifestations; ocular involvement occurred almost exclusively in ENDs. Unlike Loa loa, clinical differences appear not to be eosinophil-mediated and may reflect chronicity, intensity of infection, or the presence of Wolbachia in O. volvulus.",Association between Insulin-Like Growth Factor-I Levels and the Disease Progression and Anemia in Visceral Leishmaniasis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30761980,The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene,2019 04 10,"We analyzed the association between insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) and the pathogenesis of anemia during active visceral leishmaniasis (VL). Serum levels of IGF-I, IGF-binding protein 3 (IGFBP3), and cytokines were measured in samples from individuals with active VL and cured VL, asymptomatic Leishmania-infected, and noninfected individuals. Then, we extended our analysis to VL dogs to evaluate hematimetric parameters, bone marrow alterations, and cytokine and IGF-I expression. We identified a positive correlation between lower IGF-I and IGFBP3 levels in active VL patients and lower hemoglobin levels. In infected dogs, there was a positive correlation between lower IGF-I expression in the bone marrow and lower peripheral blood hematocrit and hemoglobin levels. There was no correlation between decreased IGF-I level/expression and any measured cytokine serum levels in either host. The data suggest that low IGF-I expression is associated with pathogenesis of anemia in active VL, primarily in severe cases, by mechanisms other than alterations in cytokine production.",Paramedic and Emergency Medical Technician Reflections on the Ongoing Impact of the 9/11 Terrorist Attacks.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30761979,Prehospital and disaster medicine,2019 03 15,"IntroductionIn the years following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks in New York City (New York USA), otherwise known as 9/11, first responders began experiencing a range of health and psychosocial impacts.

Therefore, the present study was designed to study the effect of diets rich in whole grains on PMS among nurses. This study is a parallel controlled clinical trial with a 3-month intervention period in which, after following two menstrual cycles among nurses, 100 nurses diagnosed with PMS were randomly divided into two groups of intervention and control, with fifty individuals in each. Those in the intervention group replaced at least four servings of refined grains in their daily diets with whole grains. To supply four servings, 120 g of bread made with whole flour was given to the intervention group on a daily basis. Those in the control group, however, continued their regular daily consumption of grains. The two groups were compared regarding PMS symptoms after adjusting the confounding variables. The repeated measurement test showed that the interaction between the time factor and the experimental group on the mean score of PMS symptoms was significant. That is, the intervention group showed a significant decrease in the general, mood, physical and behavioural symptoms of PMS compared with the controls (P&lt;0·001, P=0·01, P&lt;0·001 and P=0·003, respectively). Therefore, daily consumption of whole grains in place of refined grains can contribute to improvement in PMS symptoms.

Urban waste collection is one of the municipal activities with large costs and has many practical difficulties. In other words, waste collection and disposal is a costly task due to high operating expenses (fuel, maintenance, recycling, manpower, etc.) and small improvements in this field can result in tremendous savings on municipal expenditure. In the raised problem, the goal is to minimize total cost including traversing cost, vehicle employment cost, and exit penalty from permissible time windows. In this problem, the waste is deposited at the points indicating the demand nodes, in which each demand shows the volume of generated waste. Considering multiple trips for vehicles and time windows are the most critical features of the problem, so that the priorities of serving some specific places such as hospitals can be observed. Since vehicle routing problems (VRP) belongs to NP-hard problems, an efficient simulated annealing (SA) is proposed to solve the problem. The computational results show that our proposed algorithm has a great performance in a short computational time in comparison with the CPLEX solver. Finally, in order to demonstrate the applicability of the model, a case study is analyzed in Iran, and the optimal policies are presented.",Benchmarking performance of solid waste management and recycling systems in East Africa: Comparing Kigali Rwanda with other major cities.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30761955,"Waste management & research : the journal of the International Solid Wastes and Public Cleansing Association, ISWA",2019 02 14,"This paper aims to benchmark performance of combined solid waste management (SWM) and recycling systems in major cities of East Africa. The Wasteaware indicators are used to present a detailed systems analysis for Kigali in Rwanda, including a mass flow diagram; comparative data are taken from the Wasteaware database for Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, Kampala, Uganda, Nairobi, Kenya, and also for neighboring Maputo, Mozambique. The stand-out result is the relatively high collection coverage achieved, in Maputo with extensive international technical assistance, and in Kigali using its own local resources. In both cases, governance factors are key. Kigali uses a public-private partnership, with exclusive franchises in 35 sectors being tendered every three years; households pay an affordable fee depending on their ability to pay (the service is free to the poorest category); and 95% fee collection rates are achieved, partly through co-collection with charges for local security patrols, which is a service people value highly given the recent history of the country. Another key priority to improve SWM across East Africa is to eliminate open dumping - only Kampala currently has an engineered disposal site. Recycling rates also need to be increased - only Nairobi currently has a good baseline to build on (30%). Common weaknesses include a lack of segregation at source, of institutional capacity, and of available and reliable waste data.",Design opportunities for organic waste recycling in urban restaurants.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30761953,"Waste management & research : the journal of the International Solid Wastes and Public Cleansing Association, ISWA",2019 02 14,"This research project focuses on the problem of organic (or food waste) waste recycling in Flanders, Belgium. Here, the total amount of organic waste produced annually by restaurants is estimated at 166,000 tonnes. Despite being in the evolution towards a circular economy, more than 61% of the restaurants do not collect organic waste separately from residual waste. Within the research, this problem was explored from a human-centred perspective by analysing existing food-waste collection and processing equipment, and by observing the kitchen workflow and interior design of different urban located restaurants. The aim of the research was to identify design opportunities to integrate and optimize the collecting and recycling of food waste in restaurants. In sum, it was possible to distinguish different elements, variables and constraints across the various restaurants related to the disposal and handling of food waste in the kitchen and in the clearing area during the shift. The paper concludes with design requirements for the optimization of food-waste recycling systems, which are related to the cost of the system, the effort that is needed, the lack of space, potential bad odour, hygiene matters, integration in the workflow, organization of the workspace and use of additional resources and energy.",Life cycle assessment for solid waste management in Lebanon: Economic implications of carbon credit.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30761952,"Waste management & research : the journal of the International Solid Wastes and Public Cleansing Association, ISWA",2019 02 14,"Solid waste management has witnessed much progress in recent years with considerable efforts targeting the reduction of associated impacts and carbon emissions. Such efforts remain relatively limited in developing economies due to inefficient management practices. In this study, a life cycle assessment (LCA) approach is adopted to identify integrated systems with minimal impacts and reduced emissions in a developing context coupled with an economic valuation and sensitivity analysis to assess the effect of varying influencing parameters individually. The results showed that the highest impact arises from landfilling with minimal material recovery for recycling and composting, while incineration coupled with energy recovery contributed to the least equivalent emissions (-111% with respect to baseline scenario) at a varying cost of -70% to +93% depending on the selected technology and the value of carbon credit. Optimizing material recycling, composting and landfilling with energy recovery contributed to 98% savings in emissions (with respect to baseline scenario) and remained economically attractive irrespective of the carbon credit exchange rate of 0.5-50 US$/MTCO2E. The sensitivity analysis showed that an improvement in landfill gas collection efficiency (up to 60%) can contribute to major savings in emissions (58%).

The implications from this bottleneck are widely acknowledged. Nonetheless, fundamental issues such as the factors that drive households into the adoption of a particular solid waste disposal system have not been explored. This study applied a multinomial logit approach using 16,767 households in the Ghana Living Standard Survey round six data to examine whether or not socioeconomic factors influence households' decision to adopt a particular solid waste disposal system. The results established that a number of the hypothesised socioeconomic factors drive households into the use of a particular solid waste disposal system. For instance, education of households on solid waste management is important to increase households' decision into collecting wastes other than open dumping or burning. The characteristics of houses and the location of households also influence waste disposal systems in Ghana. We conclude that solid waste disposal at unapproved places was largely influenced by socioeconomic characteristics other than income or welfare of households. We recommend continuous advocacy programmes on improved solid waste management systems, led by the various decentralised governance structures such as the District Assemblies, to curb the menace.",Thermal treatment of carbon fibre reinforced polymers (Part 1: Recycling).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30761950,"Waste management & research : the journal of the International Solid Wastes and Public Cleansing Association, ISWA",2019 02 14,"The increasing use of carbon fibre reinforced polymers requires suitable disposing and recycling options, the latter being especially attractive due to the high production cost of the material. Reclaiming the fibres from their polymer matrix however is not without challenges. Pyrolysis leads to a decay of the polymer matrix but may also leave solid carbon residues on the fibre. These residues prevent fibre sizing and thereby reuse in new materials. In state of the art, these residues are removed via thermal treatment in oxygen containing atmospheres. This however may damage the fibre's tensile strength. Within the scope of this work, carbon dioxide and water vapour were used to remove the carbon residues. This aims to eliminate or at least minimize fibre damage. Improved quality of reclaimed fibres can make fibre reuse more desirable by enabling the production of high-quality recycling products. Still, even under ideal recycling conditions the fibres will shorten with every new life-cycle due to production-based blending. Fibre disposal pathways will therefore always also be necessary. The problems of thermal fibre disintegration are summarized in the second part of this article (Part 2: Energy recovery).",Experiencing the Cross-Sensory Error Signal During Movement Leads to Proprioceptive Recalibration.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30761949,Journal of motor behavior,2019 02 14,"Reaching to targets in a virtual reality environment with misaligned visual feedback of the hand results in changes in movements (visuomotor adaptation) and sense of felt hand position (proprioceptive recalibration).

Aims: To explore the practices among ward nurses that help them support patients to continue to live independently in the community; and the influence on these of personal experience of providing home care, approaches to discharge planning, and understanding about patients after discharge. Design: Cross-sectional study. Methods: The study included 178 ward nurses in three hospitals. We used a t-test to analyze differences in ward nursing practices focusing on community living by nurses' characteristics, experience in providing home-based care, discharge planning approaches, and understanding of patient situations after discharge, and a stepwise multi-regression analysis with ward nursing practices focusing on community living as the dependent variable. Results: Respondents included 167 female and 11 male nurses, with 34.8% in their 40s. Their mean length of nursing experience was 14.2 ± 9.8 years. Only 45.5% of the ward nurses recognized that discharge planning should commence on admission. The most common area of ward nursing practice focusing on community living was educating patients and their families. Cooperation with community healthcare workers was seen least frequently. The highest rate of contribution was observed in a model including recognition of the importance of discharge planning, number of conferences attended with community care service providers, experience of caring for a family member, and length of nursing experience (Adjusted R2 = 0.301).

Conclusions: Research on the learning environment using a sociocultural lens suggest workplace goals, norms and practices determined which learners engage in learning-relevant activities, to what extent, and the degree of guidance provided, with these factors creating ""tacit"" curricula that may support or compete with formal learning goals. We close with guidance on how sociocultural constructs could inform research to improve the learning environment.","Prevalence of chronic hepatitis C virus infection among childhood cancer survivors in Stockholm, Sweden.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30761933,"Acta oncologica (Stockholm, Sweden)",2019 02 21,"Childhood cancer survivors treated before 1992, when blood donor screening for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection was introduced, are at risk of transfusion-transmitted HCV infection. A national HCV screening campaign targeting blood transfusion recipients was launched in Sweden in 2007-2010. The aims of this study were to, among adult childhood cancer survivors in Stockholm County, investigate the prevalence of HCV infection, the natural course of infection, treatment outcome and anti-HCV testing frequency before, during and after the screening campaign and finally to actively screen the untested ones.",Scleroderma patient perspectives on social support from close social relationships.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30761932,Disability and rehabilitation,2019 02 14,People with rare diseases must cope with many physical and psychological challenges; an endeavor that can be difficult to carry out without external support.

Neurological symptoms such as seizures, cognitive impairment, and tremor can be observed during the course of GD, but more complex movement disorders such as chorea and myoclonus are less frequent. The mechanisms underlying movement disorders in GD are not fully understood. While some authors relate movement disorders to thyroid dysfunction, others claim an autoimmune origin. We herein report a case involving a 60-year-old woman who presented with erratic, intricate movement disorders for which a medical workup revealed GD. During the 2-year follow-up period, her neurological symptoms evolved in parallel with her thyroid function, but not with her autoimmune anti-thyroid antibody level. Her neurological symptoms completely disappeared when she became euthyroid. We herein discuss the complicated clinicobiological relationship between thyroid function and movement disorders. This relationship involves several factors, including the impact of radioactive treatment. The present case emphasizes the importance of including thyroid function screening in the workup of unexplained movement disorders.",Examining the clinical learning environment through the architectural avenue.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30761930,Medical teacher,2019 06 03,"Medical education has traditionally focused on the learners, the educators, and the curriculum, while tending to overlook the role of the designed environment. Experience indicates, however, that processes and outcomes of medical education are sensitive to the qualities and disposition of the spaces in which it occurs. This includes the clinical education within the patient care environment, termed the clinical learning environment (CLE). Recognition of this has informed the design of some new clinical learning spaces for the past decade. Competency-based clinical education can drive design requirements that differ materially from those associated with general purpose educational or clinical spaces. In this article, we outline two conceptual frameworks: (i) materialist spatiality and (ii) actor-network theory and consider how they can guide the design of spaces to support competency-based medical education and to guide the evaluation and discussion of the educational impacts of the spaces once built. We illustrate the use of these frameworks through discussion of the educational ambitions that underpinned the design of some recent clinical educational spaces. We close with practical points for consideration by educators and designers.",Emphysema: looking beyond alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30761929,Expert review of respiratory medicine,2019 03 20,"Distinct pathologies can cause chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Emphysema is a COPD-phenotype characterized by destruction of lung parenchyma. Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is a genetic cause of emphysema, whereas smoking is the most important risk factor of non-AATD emphysema. A general underappreciation of non-AATD emphysema has hampered progress in the field, and clinical guidelines have prohibited the use of emphysema as a diagnosis. Non-AATD emphysema, however, is far from irrelevant as it associates with dyspnea, reduced exercise capacity and relevant outcome measures. Areas covered: Mechanisms underlying enhanced tissue loss in emphysema are protease/antiprotease imbalance, increased oxidative stress, several fundamental cell biological processes such as programmed cell death and autophagy, and impaired repair mechanisms. Therapeutic options for emphysema vary from smoking cessation to lung volume reduction. Current pharmacological treatments have less favorable effects in emphysematous than in non-emphysematous COPD patients. Expert opinion: We advocate the acknowledgment of non-AATD emphysema as a clinical diagnosis and propose to end the era of bringing all pathologies that may lead to chronic airflow limitation together under the umbrella-term of COPD. Decelerating proteolysis and restoring damage should be main targets in emphysema. Vitamin A/K, hyaluronan, copper and roflumilast are promising candidates.",Health Advocacy for Busy Professionals: Effective Advocacy With Little Time.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30761928,Health promotion practice,2019 02 14,"Health advocacy is a central responsibility for health educators and public health practitioners, as documented clearly in our professional competencies.

Blood specimens were subjected to platelet measurements by evaluated methods and then compared against the international reference method (IRM). Eighty-two blood specimens were included. Bland-Altman plots of the differences between the evaluated methods and IRM demonstrated mean biases of PLT-LH, PLT-XNi and PLT-F of 9 × 109/L, 11 × 109/L and 2 × 109/L, respectively. For platelet transfusion guidance, all evaluated methods had acceptable accuracy. For platelet transfusion guidance, the sensitivities of PLT-LH, PLT-XNi and PLT-F were 33.3, 25.0 and 83.3%, respectively, at a transfusion threshold of 10 × 109/L, and 73.1, 61.5 and 84.6%, respectively, at transfusion threshold of 20 × 109/L. High blast count was associated with inaccurate PLT-LH and PLT-XNi. In conclusion, the PLT-F demonstrated excellent performance for diagnosis of thrombocytopenia and for platelet transfusion guidance in the evaluated specimens from acute leukemia patients. With respect to clinical relevance, careful blood smear review is necessary in case of high blast counts.","National trend of utilization, clinical and economic outcomes of transcatheter aortic valve replacement among patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30761914,Current medical research and opinion,2019 03 26,"We aimed to trend the utilization of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) among COPD patients, compare its outcomes to surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) and assess any social disparities in its outcomes.",Effects of Calf Horn as Chews on the Behavior of Laboratory Dogs.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30761913,Journal of applied animal welfare science : JAAWS,2019 02 14,"It is increasingly required that non-human animals in laboratories are provided with adequate enrichment to promote the welfare of the animals.

In this report, we describe the effect of calf horn on selected behaviors of 62 laboratory dogs (60 beagles, two Foxhound crossbreds) in three research facilities (A, B, C). In addition, we assessed the dogs' tooth condition and fecal consistency. The selected behaviors: ""aggressive behavior,"" ""mounting,"" ""tussle,"" ""coprophagy,"" ""manipulation"" of the equipment and ""abnormal behavior"" did not change. In facilities A and C, the dogs receiving horn showed a significant reduction in staying near the fence of the kennel and observing the outside area. By analyzing the overall behavior in facility B, we found that ""exploration"" increased with horn, whereas ""inactivity,"" ""social play"" and ""other social behavior"" decreased. In conclusion, the results indicate that horn of calf hooves offers alternative stimulation. We found positive effects on tartar/plaque reduction and fecal consistency which should be confirmed in further studies.","Efficacy of carvacrol on Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus engorged female ticks (Canestrini, 1887) (Acari: Ixodidae): effects on mortality and reproduction.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30761912,Natural product research,2019 02 14,"The activity of carvacrol was evaluated in R. microplus female ticks by estimating the mean lethal concentration (LC50) and the acaricidal efficacy.

Recently International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) in its 2016 press release has urged to take action against widespread mycotoxin contamination in developing countries. Deoxynivalenol (DON) is a group B trichothecene mycotoxin, produced by common field pathogens such as Fusarium graminearum and Fusarium culmorum, and reported to be the predominant contaminant of food commodities. At present, no detailed/systematic review regarding the global occurrence of DON in various food and grain samples is available in the literature. Considering DON's cosmopolitan behavior and toxicological manifestations, the present review summarizes the region-wise reports and surveys conducted across the globe during the last decade, on the occurrence of DON in the food commodities intended for human consumption. Studies conducted on DON metabolites either in food, urine or blood samples from humans have also been reviewed. The present review indicates that the current exposure levels of DON might pose a health risk for the consumers, especially in growing children, necessitating to take vigilant steps to guarantee food safety.",Genetic and antigenic heterogeneity of infectious bronchitis virus in South America: implications for control programmes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30761909,Avian pathology : journal of the W.V.P.A,2019 06 07,"Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is a persistent sanitary problem for the South American poultry industry despite extensive vaccination. The IBV single-stranded RNA genome has high rates of mutation and recombination that generate a notorious virus variability. Since most IBV vaccines are type-specific, there is a need for constant surveillance of the circulating lineages and knowledge about their genetic and antigenic properties. Here we present an integrative analysis that provides the pattern of genetic variation of the South American IBV strains and information about their antigenic characteristics. The genetic analysis was performed using the S1 complete coding sequences of all available South American strains, including newly obtained Argentine and Uruguayan field samples. Our phylogenetic and phylodynamic analyses evidence that three main lineages (GI-1, GI-11 and GI-16) are extensively circulating in South American flocks. Strains of the GI-1 lineage (Massachusetts-type) were detected in Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Colombia. The GI-11 lineage is an exclusively South American lineage that emerged in the 1950s, and is the predominant lineage in Brazil and Uruguay at present. The GI-16 lineage emerged around 1979, and is currently circulating in most South American territories (Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, Colombia and Peru). The virus cross-neutralization test performed here reveals very low antigenic relatedness between GI-11 and GI-16 lineages (i.e. they are different serotypes). The results of this study extend our knowledge about the present and past IBV variability in South America and provide relevant elements to improve the control programmes by considering the genetic and antigenic attributes of IBV.",Enhancement of antibiotic activity by phytocompounds of Turnera subulata.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30761908,Natural product research,2019 02 14,"The present study aimed to evaluate the antibacterial and modulatory activity of the Turnera subulate methyl extract in isolation or in combination with aminoglycoside antibiotics, using the microdilution method.

The Turnera subulata methyl extract presented both antibacterial and antibiotic-modulatory effects in vitro, in isolation and in association with aminoglycosides. The extract activity depends on the bacterial strain and may be associated with the presence of tannins and flavonols. However, further studies are required to characterize the Turnera subulata potential for the development of new drugs against multiresistant bacteria.",Merged block randomisation: A novel randomisation procedure for small clinical trials.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30761907,"Clinical trials (London, England)",2019 05 23,"Randomisation in small clinical trials is a delicate matter, due to the tension between the conflicting aims of balanced groups and unpredictable allocations.

This article introduces merged block randomisation, a novel and conceptually simple restricted randomisation design for small clinical trials (less than 100 patients per stratum). Merged block randomisation is a simple procedure that can be carried out without need for a computer. Merged block randomisation is not restricted to 1:1 randomisation, but is readily applied to unequal target allocations and to more than two treatment groups.",Drastic Changes in Properties of Donor-Acceptor Polymers Induced by Asymmetric Structural Isomers for Application to Polymer Solar Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30761905,ACS applied materials & interfaces,2019 03 08,"Appropriate design of donor-acceptor (D-A) conjugated polymers is important for enhancing their physical, optical, and electrochemical properties. The rapid development of D-A conjugated polymers based on fullerene and nonfullerene derivatives in the past decade has led to an improvement in the performance of polymer solar cells (PSCs). In this study, we designed and synthesized two donor polymers based on the DTffBT acceptor unit, with matching optical absorption range and energy levels with fullerene (PC71BM) and nonfullerene acceptors (ITIC and IDIC), by introducing asymmetric structural isomers of donor units. We demonstrated that materials design by structural modification dramatically affects the physical, optical, and electrochemical properties as well as the crystallinity and photovoltaic performance of the polymers. The results provide valuable insights into materials design for efficient PSCs."

The ES process was used to prepare continuous copper nanofibers (Cu-NFs), which were used as core materials and were then immersed in silver ink (Ag ink) to form a protective layer of Ag to protect the Cu-NFs from oxidation. The Ag shell layer protected the Cu-NFs against oxidation and enhanced their conductivity. Such Cu/Ag core/shell webs can be easily transferred on the flexible matrix and can be applied in TCEs. The metal NF webs of different structures exhibited various degrees of conductivity and followed the order random type > crossed type > aligned type; however, the order with respect to transmittance ( T) was inverse. The aligned nanowire networks exhibited a high T of over 80%, and the random ones exhibited a low sheet resistance of less than 102 Ω/sq (the best value is 7.85 Ω/sq).

This BCR-ABL(+) myeloproliferative disease makes up about 15%-20% of all leukemia cases in adults. CML is seen more in males than females, with a rate of three to two. However, it does not show differences in prevalence in terms of age. CML consists of three clinical phases. The first one is the chronic phase, defined by rising white blood cell levels and also by myeloid proliferation and bone marrow maturation. While this phase does not exhibit complications, in diagnosis, it comprises most of the patients. The second phase is the accelerated phase, which the disease progresses to if it is not treated or does not respond to treatment. This usually takes about 3 years. The third phase is the blastic phase. The chronic phase can still progress to the next two phases within the first 2 years, with a rate of 10%. In the following years, the possibility increases by 15%-20% each year. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are revolutionary drugs for the management of disease course in CML. The aim of this review is to assess current approaches to CML patients' follow-up and treatment with TKIs. A literature search on CML and TKIs was made in PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus with particular focus on randomized clinical trials, recommendations, guidelines, and expert opinions. In managing CML, various treatment methods have been utilized for many decades. Prior to the development of TKIs, interferon alpha was the primary tool, which was then complemented by allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). HSCT was successful in slowing the disease down in the long term and curing up to 50% of patients. Then the coming of the imatinib era opened up different treatment perspectives. For the patients resistant or intolerant to imatinib, second- and third-generation TKIs are successfully used in distinct CML disease states. The survival benefits of TKIs including imatinib, nilotinib, dasatinib, bosutinib, and ponatinib for CML patients are outstanding. TKI-related adverse events could impact the clinical course, especially in long-term drug administrations. The current aim for CML disease management in the TKI era is to provide age- and sex-matched normal life duration to CML patients.",Transcriptomic profile of cell cycle progression genes in human ovarian granulosa cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30761814,Journal of biological regulators and homeostatic agents,2019 03 23,"The ovarian granulosa cells (GCs) that form the structure of follicle undergo substantial modification during the various stages of human folliculogenesis. These modifications include morphological changes, accompanied by differential expression of genes, encoding proteins which are mainly involved in cell growth, proliferation and differentiation. Recent data bring a new insight into the aspects of GCs' stem-like specificity and plasticity, enabling their prolonged proliferation and differentiation into other cell types. This manuscript focuses attention on emerging alterations during GC cell cycle - a series of biochemical and biophysical changes within the cell. Human GCs were collected from follicles of women set to undergo intracytoplasmic sperm injection procedure, as a part of remnant follicular fluid. The cells were primarily cultured for 30 days. Throughout this time, we observed the prominent change in cell morphology from epithelial-like to fibroblast-like, suggesting differentiation to other cell types. Additionally, at days 1, 7, 15 and 30, the RNA was isolated for molecular assays. Using Affymetrix® Human Genome U219 Array, we found 2579 human transcripts that were differentially expressed in GCs. From these genes, we extracted 582 Gene Ontology Biological Process (GO BP) Terms and 45 KEGG pathways, among which we investigated transcripts belonging to four GO BPs associated with cell proliferation: ""cell cycle phase transition"", ""G1/S phase transition"", G2/M phase transition"" and ""cell cycle checkpoint"". Microarray results were validated by RT-qPCR. Increased expression of all the genes studied indicated that increase in GC proliferation during long-term in vitro culture is orchestrated by the up-regulation of genes related to cell cycle control. Furthermore, observed changes in cell morphology may be regulated by a presented set of genes, leading to the induction of pathways specific for stemness plasticity and transdifferentiation in vitro.",The acute effects of a short technique-intense training period on side-foot kick performance among elite female soccer players.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30761813,The Journal of sports medicine and physical fitness,2019 02 14,"Previously, it was shown that elite soccer teams were 24% more likely to win matches if their passing effectiveness were increased by 1%.

General information about the endocrinology of vitamin D and its role in maintaining various aspects of mens health is presented. The authors analyze currently known pathophysiological mechanisms involving vitamin D interacting with each other within the framework of the pathogenesis of MS and AP. At present, there is much evidence that MS and AP have common universal interacting mechanisms of pathogenesis (obesity, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, systemic chronic subclinical inflammation, endothelial dysfunction) that are realized with the direct participation of vitamin D. The authors argue that taking into account a global prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in the modern population, accompanied by an increasing incidence of both MS and AP affecting younger populations, a rational management of vitamin D metabolism in men can be regarded as a promising and effective pathogenetic prevention of MS and BPH.",[Magnetic resonance imaging in the diagnosis of recurrent prostate cancer].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30761810,"Urologiia (Moscow, Russia : 1999)",2019 05 09,The article reviews the domestic and international literature on local recurrence of prostate cancer both after surgery and non-invasive treatments.
