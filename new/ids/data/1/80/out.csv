There is evidence that during pregnancy women develop enhanced processing of facial features associated with infancy and distress, as these cues signal vulnerability and are therefore biologically salient. In this study, 51 pregnant women at 17-36 weeks gestation watched neutral infant and adult faces gradually morph into either happy or sad expressions. We measured the speed and accuracy with which participants were able to recognize facial affect (happy vs. sad) across facial ages (infant vs. adult). Participants were faster and more accurate at recognizing happy versus sad faces and adult versus infant faces. We discuss how prior exposure to a certain face type may explain faster recognition. We also consider these results in the context of evidence indicating positive affect is recognized more quickly, but associated with slower attention and detection.","New anthra[2,3-b]furancarboxamides: A role of positioning of the carboxamide moiety in antitumor properties.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659997,European journal of medicinal chemistry,2019 03 21,"Derivatives of the anthraquinone (anthracene-9,10-dione) such as doxorubicin, mitoxantrone and others have proved great clinical efficacy for decades. Currently the search in this exceptionally productive chemical class is aimed at optimization of antitumor properties including circumvention of drug resistance. Previously we have reported that heteroarene-fused anthraquinones fused to a 5-membered heterocyclic ring are advantageous in killing drug resistant tumor cells. Herein we present the synthesis and antitumor properties of a series of new anthra[2,3-b]furan-2-carboxamides. Vast majority of new derivatives were similarly cytotoxic to wild type tumor cell lines and their isogenic sublines with P-glycoprotein overexpression and/or p53 inactivation. Comparison of structurally close derivatives varying in their position relative to the furan moiety, that is, furan-3-carboxamide 1vs furan-2-carboxamides 5 and 6, revealed fundamental differences in the cytotoxicity profiles, formation of drug-DNA complexes, efficacy of topoisomerase 1 inhibition and mechanisms of tumor cell death.

In this study, we focused on the southwest economic zone (including Chongqing, Sichuan, Guangxi, Yunnan, and Guizhou), which is in the middle-industrialization stage and aims to mitigate CO2 emissions during strategic industrial transformation. We applied a framework with refined indicators based on input-output analysis (IOA) and structural decomposition analysis (SDA) to characterize and quantify the impact of industrial structure change on CO2 emissions during 2002-2012. In this period, construction ranked first in CO2 emission due to relatively high-carbon production structure and increasing share in final demand, which increased construction related CO2 emissions. Furthermore, we found that diversification in development and competitive industries had different impacts on CO2 emission trends. Yunnan and Guizhou experienced a transition from light manufacturing to resource-related manufacturing; therefore, CO2 emissions in resource-related manufacturing showed an increasing trend due to the extensive production structure in the two provinces, while it showed a decreasing trend in the other three provinces. Moreover, Chongqing, Sichuan, and Guangxi showed an apparent expansion trend in machinery manufacturing and related CO2 emissions, driven by investment, final demand structure, and production structure changes. Meanwhile, this zone avoided large-scale CO2 emissions in these sectors through net imports, by making good use of geographical advantages and trade structure. The CO2 emissions of the service sectors showed increasing trends due to increasing proportions in consumption structure and final demand structure. Furthermore, this led to a transition from consumer services to producer services with expansion. Among the five provinces, Chongqing had the lowest-carbon development pattern, owing to its higher technical levels of manufacturing and relatively lower-carbon production structure, which could be a reference point for rapid low-carbon economic development under middle industrialization for the other provinces or regions with the similar industrial characteristics.",Association Between Helicobacter pylori Exposure and Decreased Odds of Eosinophilic Esophagitis-A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659992,Clinical gastroenterology and hepatology : the official clinical practice journal of the American Gastroenterological Association,2019 04 13,"Previous or current infection with Helicobacter pylori (exposure) has been reported to protect against eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), perhaps owing to H pylori-induced immunomodulation.

This conclusion is corroborated by bone phenotypes in mice with genetic disruption of the circadian molecular clock mechanism, for instance via deletion of the transcription factor Brain and Muscle Arntl-like 1 (Bmal1). To dissect the contribution of circadian molecular clocks in individual bone cell types, we generated mice with conditional deletion of Bmal1 in osteoclasts (Ctsk-cre) and in mesenchymal cells of the limbs (Prx1-cre). We report that deletion of Bmal1 in osteoclasts had no effect on trabecular or cortical bone parameters in vivo or on osteoclast differentiation in vitro. In contrast, Bmal1f/f.Prx1-cre mice had significantly less trabecular and cortical bone than Bmal1f/f littermate controls, recapitulating the bone phenotype of Bmal1 germline deficient mice. The number of osteoblast precursors in the bone marrow of Bmal1f/f.Prx1-cre mice was similar to wild-type controls, while the in vitro differentiation capacity of Bmal1-deficient osteoblast precursors, measured as induction of alkaline phosphatase activity, was significantly lower. Despite this, serum procollagen type 1 N-terminal propeptide (P1NP), a measure of bone formation in vivo, was higher in Bmal1f/f.Prx1-cre mice than in Bmal1f/f mice. Consistent with a high bone turnover state in the mutant mice, the bone resorption marker serum C-terminal telopeptides of Type I collagen (CTX-I) was also elevated, and Bmal1f/f.Prx1-cre mice had a higher number of tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) positive osteoclasts than Bmal1f/f controls. These results demonstrate that adult bone mass in mice is controlled by the intrinsic circadian molecular clock in mesenchymal cells but not osteoclasts. The effect of the mesenchymal cell clock on bone turnover appears to involve osteoblast-osteoclast cross-talk.",Cellular senescence in bone.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659978,Bone,2019 04 30,"Cellular senescence refers to a process induced by various types of stress that causes irreversible cell cycle arrest and distinct cellular alterations, including profound changes in gene expression, metabolism, and chromatin organization as well as activation/reinforcement of anti-apoptotic pathways and development of a pro-inflammatory secretome or senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). However, because of challenges and technical limitations in identifying and characterizing senescent cells in living organisms, only recently have some of the diverse in vivo roles of these unique cells been discovered. New findings indicate that senescent cells and their SASP can have acute beneficial functions, such as in tissue regeneration and wound healing. However, in contrast, when senescent cells accumulate in excess chronically at sites of pathology or in old tissues they drive multiple age-associated chronic diseases. Senotherapeutics that selectively eliminate senescent cells (""senolytics"") or inhibit their detrimental SASP (""senomorphics"") have been developed and tested in aged preclinical models. These studies have established that targeting senescence is a powerful anti-aging strategy to improve ""healthspan"" - i.e., the healthy period of life free of chronic disease. The roles of senescence in mediating age-related bone loss have been a recent focus of rigorous investigation. Studies in mice and humans demonstrate that with aging, at least a subset of most cell types in the bone microenvironment become senescent and develop a heterogeneous SASP. Furthermore, age-related bone loss can be alleviated in old mice, with apparent advantages over anti-resorptive therapy, by reducing the senescent cell burden genetically or pharmacologically with the first class of senolytics or a senomorphic. Collectively, these findings point to targeting senescence as a transformational strategy to extend healthspan, therefore providing strong rationale for identifying and optimizing senotherapeutics to alleviate multiple chronic diseases of aging, including osteoporosis, and set the stage for translating senotherapeutics to humans, with clinical trials currently ongoing.",The relationship between volumetric thoracic bone mineral density and coronary calcification in men and women - results from the Copenhagen General Population Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659977,Bone,2019 02 26,The association between low bone mineral density (BMD) and the presence of coronary artery calcium (CAC) as a marker of atherosclerosis is unclear.

Thirty-four participants (mean ± SD age: 68.6 ± 10.1 years, 24 females) were included in this study. VO2 max was assessed with the Rockport 1-mile walk test (range = 6.68-45.57). Participants engaged in a cognitive task, the Modified Stroop Color Word Test (MSCWT) on a self-paced treadmill while simultaneously standing or walking. Performance on the Stroop Test was measured as interference of the accuracy score. Participants demonstrated over a 4-fold increase in SI when going from Incongruent to Switching MSCWT blocks across both standing and walking tasks. Furthermore, there was a significant interaction between the MSCWT block and VO2 max in Stroop interference, such that Switching Stroop interference demonstrated greater changes due to VO2 max, in comparison to Incongruent SI, even after controlling for age, gender, body mass index, and years of education as covariates in analyses. These results provide evidence of a relationship between aerobic fitness and cognition, suggesting that dual-task interference may provide a sensitive indicator of effects of an aerobic intervention program on the cognitive performance among older adults.","Budesonide, Aclidinium and Formoterol in combination limit inflammaging processes in bronchial epithelial cells exposed to cigarette smoke.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659954,Experimental gerontology,2019 02 16,"Inflammation and cellular senescence (also called inflammaging) are involved in the pathogenesis of premature lung aging, a key driver of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Downregulation of histone deacetylases and FoxO3 expression, activation of the ERK 1/2 pathway and IL-8 increase are hallmarks of lung inflammaging. The effects of Budesonide (BUD), Aclidinium (ACL) and Formoterol (FO) on lung inflammaging are unknown. This study was aimed to assess the effects of BUD, ACL and FO in bronchial epithelial cells exposed to cigarette smoke extract (CSE) by evaluating: a) Expression of TLR4 and survivin and LPS binding by flow cytometry; b) expression of HDAC2, HDAC3, SIRT1 and FoxO3 and activation of the ERK 1/2 pathway by western blot; c) IL-8 mRNA levels and release by Real Time-PCR and ELISA, respectively. Reported results show that CSE increased TLR4 and survivin, LPS binding, ERK 1/2 activation, IL-8 release and mRNA levels but decreased SIRT1, HDAC2, HDAC3 and FoxO3 nuclear expression. Combined therapy with BUD, ACL and FO counteracted the effects of CSE on LPS binding, FoxO3 nuclear expression, ERK 1/2 activation, survivin and IL-8 release and mRNA levels. These findings suggest a new role of combination therapy with BUD, ACL and FO in counteracting inflammaging processes induced by cigarette smoke exposure.",Introduction of 5-aminolevulinic acid as a theranostics agent in dentistry.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659953,Photodiagnosis and photodynamic therapy,2019 03 30,The aim of this paper is to study the theranostic potential of 5-Aminolevulinic Acid (5-ALA)in dentistry.,Coping with climatic extremes: Dietary fat content decreased the thermal resilience of barramundi (Lates calcarifer).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659952,"Comparative biochemistry and physiology. Part A, Molecular & integrative physiology",2019 02 15,"Aquatic organisms, including important cultured species, are forced to contend with acute changes in water temperature as the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events worsen. Acute temperature spikes are likely to threaten aquaculture species, but dietary intervention may play an important protective role. Increasing the concentration of macronutrients, for example dietary fat content, may improve the thermal resilience of aquaculture species, however, this remains unexplored. To evaluate this hypothesis, we used two commercially available diets (20% versus 10% crude fat) to examine if dietary fat content improves the growth performance of juvenile barramundi (Lates calcarifer) while increasing their resilience to acute thermal stress. Fish were fed their assigned diets for 28-days before assessing the upper thermal tolerance (CTMAX) and the thermal sensitivity of swimming performance (UCRIT) and metabolism. We found that feeding fish a high fat diet resulted in heavier fish, but did not affect the thermal sensitivity of swimming performance or metabolism over an 18 °C temperature range (from 20 to 38 °C). Thermal tolerance was compromised in fish fed the high fat diet by 0.48 °C, showing significantly lower CTMAX. Together, these results suggest that while a high fat diet increases juvenile L. calcarifer growth, it does not benefit physiological performance across a range of relevant water temperatures and may even reduce fish tolerance of extreme water temperatures. These data may have implications for aquaculture production in a warming world, where episodic extremes of temperature are likely to become more frequent.",Molecular characterization of ecdysis triggering hormone and its receptor in citrus red mite (Panonychus citri).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659951,"Comparative biochemistry and physiology.

However, the molecular characterization of ETH and ETHR in Chelicerata remains unknown. In this study, we identified and characterized the full-length cDNA of ETH and ETHR in citrus red mite Panonychus citri (McGregor). Phylogenetic analysis indicated that PcETHR was closely related to the insect ETHR subtype B. A calcium mobilization-based functional assay showed that PcETH activated the PcETHR in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, a sharp upregulation of PcETH before ecdysis was observed by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), and it revealed a tight correlation of ETH signaling and the molting process. These are the first insights into the molecular characterization of ETH and its receptor in mites as P. citri. Our work provides basic information of the ETH and ETHR in P. citri and lays a solid foundation for further physiological functions to better understand the ETH signaling system in mites.",Hypoxia alters the expression of hif-1a mRNA and downstream HIF-1 response genes in embryonic and larval lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659950,"Comparative biochemistry and physiology. Part A, Molecular & integrative physiology",2019 02 15,"Lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis) embryos and larvae were exposed to hypoxia at different developmental ages to determine when the cellular response to hypoxia could be initiated. mRNA levels of hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (hif-1α), hsp70, and several HIF-1 target genes were quantified in embryos at 21, 38, 63, 83- and 103-days post fertilisation (dpf) and in larvae at 1, 2, 3- and 4-weeks post hatch (wph) following a 6-hour hypoxia exposure. hsp70 mRNA levels were increased in response to hypoxia at all embryonic ages. By comparison, the first observed change in hif-1α mRNA in response to hypoxia was at 38 dpf, where it was down-regulated from high basal levels, with this response persisting through to 83 dpf. Interestingly, this decrease in hif-1α mRNA coincided with increases in the mRNA levels of the HIF-1 target genes: vegfa (vascular endothelial growth factor A), igfbp1 (insulin-like growth factor binding protein 1), ldha (lactate dehydrogenase a), gapdh (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) and epo (erythropoietin) at select ages. Collectively, this suggests a possible HIF-1-mediated response to hypoxia despite a decrease in hif-1α mRNA. Coinciding with a decrease in basal levels, increases in hif-1α were measured in response to hypoxia at 103 dpf and in larval fish at 1, 2 and 3 wph but there were no consistent increases in HIF-1 target genes at these ages. Overall, our findings indicate that lake whitefish can mount a response to hypoxia early in embryogenesis which may mitigate some of the damaging effects of exposure to low oxygen levels at these critical life history stages.",Long noncoding RNA MIR31HG is activated by SP1 and promotes cell migration and invasion by sponging miR-214 in NSCLC.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659947,Gene,2019 03 05,"Long non-coding RNAs(lncRNAs) have been reported to play pivotal roles in various cancers. Recently, MIR31HG was proposed to be involved in tumor progression. However, its role in non small cell lung cancer(NSCLC) remains elusive. In this work, we found that SP1-induced MIR31HG was significantly upregulated in NSCLC tissues and cell lines. Moreover, Cox multivariate survival analysis revealed that high MIR31HG was an independent predictor of poor overall survival(OS). Functionally, knockdown of TINCR obviously suppressed NSCLC cells migration and invasion in vitro and inhibited NSCLC cells metastasis in vivo. Mechanistically, we identified MIR31HG could act as a miR-214 sponge using RNA pull down, luciferase reporter and RIP assays. Lastly, we verified that overexpression of MIR31HG effectively reverses miR-214-induced inhibition of NSCLC cells progression. Therefore, MIR31HG might serve as a promising prognostic marker and potential therapeutic target for NSCLC patients.",Circulating exosomal and Argonaute-bound microRNAs in preeclampsia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659946,Gene,2019 03 05,"microRNAs (miRNAs) play important role in the regulation of placental development, and abnormal miRNA expression is associated with preeclampsia (PE). miRNAs are released from trophoblast cells to maternal blood flow, where they are highly stable, being encapsulated inside extracellular vesicles, like exosomes or bound to Argonaute proteins. In PE, placental dysfunction leads to aberrant extracellular miRNA secretion. hsa-miR-210 is a hypoxia-sensitive miRNA found to be upregulated in PE; however, it is unknown whether it is the cause or the consequence of the disease.",A novel MAF missense mutation leads to congenital nuclear cataract by impacting the transactivation of crystallin and noncrystallin genes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659945,Gene,2019 03 05,"The transcription factor v-maf avain musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma oncogene homolog (MAF) plays an important role in lens development. It contains a unique extended homology region (EHR) in the DNA binding domain. MAF mutations are associated with phenotypically distinct forms of congenital cataract and show different effects on the transactivation of target genes. Mutations in the MAF EHR region were rarely reported and their corresponding phenotype and impact on target genes' transactivation were not evaluated. A three- generation Chinese family with congenital cataract was recruited. The patients in the family present non-syndromic congenital nuclear and lamellar opacities. A novel MAF mutation (c.812 T > A, p.Val271Glu) was identified by targeted next-generation sequencing. The mutation is in highly conserved EHR region of MAF and co-segregates with the cataract in the family. It is predicted to be pathogenic by multiple algorithms and is absent in a control population. Dual luciferase activity assay shows the mutation significantly impair the transcriptional activity of four crystallin genes (CRYAA, CRYBA4, CRYBA1, and CRYGA) and two non-crystallin genes (HMOX1 and KDELR2). Herein, we report a novel missense mutation in the MAF EHR region of the DNA binding domain in a family with congenital cataract. The mutation is associated with non-syndromic bilateral nuclear cataract and impacts the transactivation of cataract associated genes involved in lens structure and stress response.",Molecular interactions and mutational impact upon rhodopsin (G90→D90) for hindering dark adaptation of eye: A comparative structural level outlook for signaling mechanism in night blindness.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659944,Mutation research,2019 05 23,"For night blindness, a detailed structural exploration of the interactions among G-protein receptor rhodopsin, transducin and arrestin was performed. Rhodopsin is responsible for dim light vision while a point mutation (G90→D90) results in an adverse change in its photo-transduction. The validated 3D models of the three proteins were utilized, and upon mutation and interactions, rhodopsin attained higher stability (evaluated through thermodynamic energy calculations, electrostatic surface potential and solvent accessible area), thereby participating strongly with transducin. Conformational switches in mutated rhodopsin also depicted a firm conformation with few 310 helices accompanied by increased percentage of pure α-helices and sheets. All evaluations were corroborated through paired T-tests. Glu33 (glycosylated unit in the N-terminal zone) of rhodopsin plays a chief role in the overall interaction pattern. Arg69 and Glu33 from wild-type rhodopsin participated in ionic interactions, while the latter set of ionic interaction remained preserved even after mutation. Cys323 (C-terminal residue) and Arg69 formed H-bonds from the wild-type rhodopsin. Cys323 exceptionally supports cellular signaling pattern in the non-mutated situation and for the non-sufferers of night-blindness. Ser297 and Tyr43 from mutated rhodopsin reside in helices and interact with Thr32 of transducin, preserving the steady conformation in activated interacted state, even in the dark. Ser297 lies adjoined to Lys296 (retinal attachment site), which resides in NPXXY motif (an ""activation switch"" for signal transduction). Thus, the molecular facet for involvement of photo-transduction, which holds a paramount zone in ophthalmology, was dealt with. This might instigate the future prospect for drug discovery to prevent such mutations."

Nineteen hypertensive breastfeeding women treated with 20 mg nifedipine every 12 hours were investigated. Blood and BM samples were collected simultaneously 15-30 days after delivery and at least 15 days after drug treatment. Patients genotyped as ABCG2 c.421CC showed nifedipine plasma and BM concentrations ranging from 8.32-178.1 ng/mL and 4.8-58.5 ng/mL, respectively.

In utero B[a]P exposure exerts multiple adverse effects on embryo development, although the underlying molecular mechanisms have still not been clearly elucidated. In the present study, we used human embryonic stem cell derived embryoid body (EB) as an in vitro model to investigate the embryotoxicity effects of B[a]P. EBs were exposed to B[a]P for 14 days, and the morphology, viability and differentiation of the cells were analyzed, in addition to the molecular changes. The results showed that B[a]P exposure repressed cell growth, impaired the morphology, and triggered apoptosis in the EBs. In addition, B[a]P reduced the gene expression levels of the ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm biomarkers. Finally, B[a]P inhibited the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process and the Akt/GSK-3β signaling pathway. Taken together, B[a]P-induced aberrant EB development and apoptosis were related to EMT process and the Akt/GSK-3β signaling pathway modulation.",Sanitary pads and diapers contain higher phthalate contents than those in common commercial plastic products.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659930,"Reproductive toxicology (Elmsford, N.Y.)",2019 05 09,"Sanitary pads and diapers are made of synthetic plastic materials that can potentially be released while being used. This study measured the amounts of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) (methylene chloride, toluene, and xylene) and phthalates (DBP, DEHP, DEP, and BBP) contained in sanitary pads and diapers. In sanitary pads, 5,900- and 130-fold differences of VOC and phthalate concentrations were seen among the brands. In the diapers, 3- and 63-fold differences of VOC and phthalate concentrations were detected among the brands. VOC concentrations from the sanitary pads and diapers were similar to that of the residential air. However, phthalate concentrations of sanitary pads and diapers were significantly higher than those found in common commercial plastic products. As sanitary pads and diapers are in direct contact with external genitalia for an extended period, there is a probability that a considerable amount of VOCs or phthalates could be absorbed into the reproductive system.",Zebrafish as a predictive screening model to assess macrophage clearance of liposomes in vivo.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659929,"Nanomedicine : nanotechnology, biology, and medicine",2019 05 15,"Macrophage recognition of nanoparticles is highly influenced by particle size and surface modification. Due to the lack of appropriate in vivo screening models, it is still challenging and time-consuming to characterize and optimize nanomedicines regarding this undesired clearance mechanism. Therefore, we validate zebrafish embryos as an emerging vertebrate screening tool to assess the macrophage sequestration of surface modified particulate formulations with varying particle size under realistic biological conditions. Liposomes with different PEG molecular weights (PEG350-PEG5000) at different PEG densities (3.0-10.0 mol%) and particle sizes between 60 and 120 nm were used as a well-established reference system showing various degrees of macrophage uptake. The results of in vitro experiments, zebrafish embryos, and in vivo rodent biodistribution studies were consistent, highlighting the validity of the newly introduced zebrafish macrophage clearance model.

Molecular basis of disease,2019 05 06,"Viral noncoding RNAs (Epstein-Barr virus-encoded RNAs, EBERs) are believed to play a critical role in the progression of lymphoma and nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). However, the accurate mechanisms accounting for their oncogenic function have not been elucidated, especially in terms of interaction between tumor cells and mesenchymal cells. Here, we report that, in addition to NPC cells, EBERs are also found in endothelial cells in Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-infected NPC parenchymal tissues, which implicates NPC-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) in transmitting EBERs to endothelial cells. In support of this hypothesis, we first ascertained if EBERs could be transferred to endothelial cells via EVs isolated from NPC culture supernatant. Then, we clarified that EVs-derived EBERs could promote angiogenesis through stimulation of VCAM-1 expression. Finally, we explored the involvement of EBER recognition by TLR3 and RIG-I in NPC angiogenesis. Our observations collectively illustrate the significance and mechanism of EVs-derived EBERs in angiogenesis and underlie the interaction mechanisms between EBV-infected NPC cells and the tumor microenvironment.",Glaucocalyxin A-induced oxidative stress inhibits the activation of STAT3 signaling pathway and suppresses osteosarcoma progression in vitro and in vivo.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659925,Biochimica et biophysica acta. Molecular basis of disease,2019 05 06,"Osteosarcoma (OS) is ranked as the most common primary bone malignancy in children and adolescents worldwide, and the 5-year overall survival rate of OS is not optimistic. Constitutive activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) has been implicated in tumor cell growth, proliferation, and anti-apoptosis in OS. Therefore, the discovery of novel molecular compounds that can effectively block STAT3 activation, is essential for the treatment of OS and improving prognosis. Here, we investigate whether Glaucocalyxin A (GLA), derived from Rabdosia japonica, exhibit the potential anticancer effects in OS. First of all, we identify that GLA potently suppressed cell proliferation, induced G2/M phase arrest and promoted substantial apoptosis in OS. Next, we conclude that GLA could induce Reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated oxidative stress via an imbalance of GSH and GSSG. Then, we elucidate for the first time that GLA could significantly inhibit both constitutive and IL-6-inducible activation of STAT3 (Tyr705) and JAK2, the upstream regulator of STAT3. Furthermore, we elucidate that the inhibition of STAT3 is mainly induced by ROS-mediated oxidative stress. Overall, our findings demonstrate that GLA could exhibit potent anticancer effects through effectively blocking the STAT3 signaling pathway, which was induced by ROS-mediated oxidative stress in OS in vitro and in vivo.",Genotype tailored treatment of mild symptomatic acid reflux in children with uncontrolled asthma (GenARA): Rationale and methods.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659924,Contemporary clinical trials,2019 03 06,"Asthma causes enormous suffering and cost for children in the US and around the world [1-3]. Co-morbid gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) makes asthma management more difficult due to increased symptoms. Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) drugs are effective at improving to GERD symptoms, however they have demonstrated only modest and variable effects on asthma control in the setting of co-morbid GERD. Importantly, PPI metabolism and efficacy depend on CYP2C19 genotype. The Genotype Tailored Treatment of Symptomatic Acid Reflux in Children with Uncontrolled Asthma (GenARA) study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to determine if genotype-tailored PPI dosing improves asthma symptoms among children with inadequately controlled asthma and GERD symptoms. This study has an innovative design to both assess the efficacy of genotype-tailored PPI dosing and perform pharmacokinetic modeling of the oral PPI Lansoprazole. Children ages 6-17 years old with clinician-diagnosed asthma and mild GERD symptoms will submit a saliva sample for CYP2C19 genotyping. Participants will undergo a two-step randomization to: (1) genotype-tailored versus conventional dosing of open-label oral lansoprazole for pharmacokinetic modeling, and (2) genotype-tailored lansoprazole daily versus placebo for 24 weeks to determine the effect of genotype-tailored PPI dosing on asthma control. Measures of asthma control, spirometry, and nasal washes during acute illnesses will be collected at 8-week intervals throughout the study. GenARA will better define the effects of CYP2C19 genotype on the dose response of lansoprazole in children and adolescents and assess if a novel dosing regimen improves GERD and asthma control.","In vitro characterization of physico-chemical properties, cytotoxicity, bioactivity of urea-crosslinked hyaluronic acid and sodium ascorbyl phosphate nasal powder formulation.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659923,International journal of pharmaceutics,2019 06 13,"An innovative lyophilized dry powder formulation consisting of urea-crosslinked hyaluronic acid (HA-CL) and sodium ascorbyl phosphate (SAP) - LYO HA-CL - SAP- was prepared and characterized in vitro for physico-chemical and biological properties. The aim was to understand if LYO HA-CL - SAP could be used as adjuvant treatment for nasal inflammatory diseases. LYO HA-CL - SAP was suitable for nasal delivery and showed to be not toxic on human nasal septum carcinoma-derived cells (RPMI 2650 cells) at the investigated concentrations. It displayed porous, polygonal particles with unimodal, narrow size distribution, mean geometric diameter of 328.3 ± 27.5 µm, that is appropriate for nasal deposition with no respirable fraction and 88.7% of particles with aerodynamic diameter >14.1 µm. Additionally, the formulation showed wound healing ability on RPMI 2650 cells, and reduced interleukin-8 (IL-8) level in primary nasal epithelial cells pre-induced with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Transport study across RPMI 2650 cells showed that HA-CL could act not only as carrier for SAP and active ingredient itself, but potentially also as mucoadhesive agent. In conclusion, these results suggest that HA-CL and SAP had anti-inflammatory activity and acted in combination to accelerate wound healing. Therefore, LYO HA-CL - SAP could be a potential adjuvant in nasal anti-inflammatory formulations."

Current smokers or former smokers who quit smoking <1 year prior to the survey were selected from the data of 2015 Korea Community Health Survey (N = 45,686). The effects of the price of tobacco on smoking behaviors were measured. The major effects were defined as quitting, reducing smoking and using electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes). Chi-square tests and multiple logistic regression analyses were performed. After tobacco prices increased, 3.8%, 22.8% and 5.4% of subjects quit, reduced smoking and switched to e-cigarettes. The adjusted odds ratio (aOR) for reducing smoking was significantly higher in subjects with a lower household income and lower education level than in those with a greater income and higher education level among current smokers. Subjects who started smoking at an older age, who smoked a smaller number of cigarettes smoked per day and who had been exposed to anti-smoking campaigns and anti-smoking information were more likely to reduce smoking after the price of tobacco increased. Younger subjects were less likely to reduce smoking, but they were more likely to use e-cigarettes after the price of tobacco increased. Low-income subjects were sensitive to increases in the price of tobacco. Additional strategies are required to change the smoking behaviors of heavy smokers. Future studies should investigate the long-term effects of increasing the price of tobacco, especially on younger adults, on smoking behaviors.","Simulated impacts and potential cost effectiveness of Communities Putting Prevention to Work: Tobacco control interventions in 21 U.S. communities, 2010-2020.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659909,Preventive medicine,2019 02 10,"In 2010, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) funded communities to implement policy, systems, and environmental (PSE) changes under the Communities Putting Prevention to Work (CPPW) program to make it easier for people to make healthier choices to prevent chronic disease. Twenty-one of 50 funded communities implemented interventions intended to reduce tobacco use. To examine the potential cost-effectiveness of tobacco control changes implemented under CPPW from a healthcare system perspective, we compared program cost estimates with estimates of potential impacts. We used an existing simulation model, the Prevention Impacts Simulation Model (PRISM), to estimate the potential cumulative impact of CPPW tobacco interventions on deaths and medical costs averted through 2020. We collected data on the costs to implement CPPW tobacco interventions from 2010 to 2013. We adjusted all costs to 2010 dollars. CPPW tobacco interventions cost $130.5 million across all communities, with an average community cost of $6.2 million. We found $735 million in potentially averted medical costs cumulatively from 2010 through 2020 because of the CPPW-supported interventions. If the CPPW tobacco control PSE changes are sustained through 2020 without additional funding after 2013, we find that medical costs averted will likely exceed program costs by $604 million. Our results suggest that the medical costs averted through 2020 may more than offset the initial investment in CPPW tobacco control interventions, implying that such interventions may be cost saving, especially over the long term.","Associations between cervical, breast and colorectal cancer screening uptake, chronic diseases and health-related behaviours: Data from the Italian PASSI nationwide surveillance.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659908,Preventive medicine,2019 02 10,"Screening programmes have been proposed as a privileged setting for health promotion interventions. We aim to assess the associations between behavioural risk factors, chronic conditions and diseases and cervical, breast and colorectal cancer screening uptake. Secondly, we aim to assess whether these associations are due to underlying differences in socioeconomic characteristics. In Italy, a random sample was interviewed by the PASSI surveillance (106,000 interviews) in 2014-2016. Screening uptake adjusted for age and gender alone and for age, gender and socioeconomic characteristics (educational attainment and self-reported economic difficulties) were estimated using multivariate Poisson regression models. Screening uptake was 79%, 73% and 45% for cervical (age 25-64), breast (women aged 50-69) and colorectal cancer (both sexes age 50-69), respectively. People with low consumption of vegetables and fruits and those with insufficient physical activity had lower uptake than people with healthy behaviours (20-22% and 8-15% lower, respectively), as did those obese and diabetic compared to healthier people (7-10% and 5-8% lower, respectively). Those with high-risk drinking behaviour, self-reported driving after drinking alcohol, and former smokers had higher screening uptake (3-7%, 3-6%, and 7-14% higher, respectively). Differences in uptake decreased after adjusting for socioeconomic characteristics, but trends were unvaried. In conclusion, screening uptake is negatively associated with unfavourable behaviours and health conditions that are also risk factors for breast and colorectal cancer incidence. Socioeconomic characteristics do not fully explain these differences. Health promotion interventions targeting diet and physical activity nested in screening programmes might miss part of the at-risk population.",Influence of farming practices on the population genetics of the maize pathogen Cercospora zeina in South Africa.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659907,Fungal genetics and biology : FG & B,2019 03 22,"Gray leaf spot (GLS) is an important foliar disease of maize. This disease, caused by Cercospora zeina, is prevalent in both smallholder and commercial maize farms in South Africa. Notably, smallholder practices are geared towards conservation agriculture, planting diverse maize genotypes within a field and avoiding chemical control. This study examined the population genetic structure of 129 C. zeina isolates from three smallholder farm sites in KwaZulu-Natal in South Africa using 13 microsatellite markers. These were analysed, together with 239 isolates previously analysed from four commercial farms in the same province, to determine whether farming systems influence the genetic diversity of C.zeina. In addition, we wanted to determine whether the smallholder farming system harboured a greater diversity of C.zeina haplotypes due to lack of chemical spraying of these crops. Overall, farming systems exhibited partial, but significant, population differentiation, contributing 10% of the genetic variation observed. A 16% genetic variation conferred between KwaNxamalala (smallholder) and Cedara (commercial) areas that are in close proximity, confirmed this. Private alleles accounted for 29% of the 52 alleles observed in smallholder farms. Smallholder farms harboured a higher gene and genotypic diversity, with a clonal fraction of only 13% compared to 32% in commercial farms. Mating type ratios indicative of sexual recombination and lower linkage disequilibrium in most smallholder populations were consistent with higher levels of diversity. This study suggests that commercial farming practices, such as fungicides and monoculture crop planting, may result in a narrower genetic diversity of the pathogen that is then propagated by asexual reproduction. In contrast, management of GLS disease in smallholder farms should consider the greater diversity of pathogen genotypes, especially if future research shows that this equates to a greater diversity of pathogenicity alleles.","Application of carbon nanotubes in cancer vaccines: Achievements, challenges and chances.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659906,Journal of controlled release : official journal of the Controlled Release Society,2019 03 29,"Tumour-specific, immuno-based therapeutic interventions can be considered as safe and effective approaches for cancer therapy. Exploitation of nano-vaccinology to intensify the cancer vaccine potency may overcome the need for administration of high vaccine doses or additional adjuvants and therefore could be a more efficient approach. Carbon nanotube (CNT) can be described as carbon sheet(s) rolled up into a cylinder that is nanometers wide and nanometers to micrometers long. Stemming from the observed capacities of CNTs to enter various types of cells via diversified mechanisms utilising energy-dependent and/or passive routes of cell uptake, the use of CNTs for the delivery of therapeutic agents has drawn increasing interests over the last decade.

In an attempt to overcome these issues and efficiently deliver cytotoxic drugs to the tumor, we previously reported a strategy termed radiation-induced apoptosis-targeted chemotherapy (RIATC), which utilizes the radiotherapy for intentionally triggering the caspase-3 and in situ amplification of tumor apoptosis by caspase-3 activated prodrug. Herein, we propose an advanced form of RIATC prodrug, AP1-DEVD-S-DOX, that could more actively target to the ligands of radiation-induced tumor cells, which could accumulate more prodrugs, thereby allowing more effective in situ activation and amplification of tumor apoptosis, comparing to RIATC. Indeed, AP1-DEVD-S-DOX was able to exert improved doxorubicin (DOX) delivery to the tumor and anticancer effect than the RIATC prodrug that lacks apoptotic cell-binding property but having a similar degree of off-target distribution in the other organs. Accordingly, AP1-DEVD-S-DOX could be an efficient prodrug for concurrent chemoradiotherapy by selectively delivering doxorubicin to the tumor with less systemic cytotoxicity.",Dexamethasone palmitate nanoparticles: An efficient treatment for rheumatoid arthritis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659904,Journal of controlled release : official journal of the Controlled Release Society,2019 02 18,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a prevalent autoimmune disease characterized by joint inflammation, bone and cartilage erosion. The use of glucocorticoids in the treatment of RA is hampered by significant side effects induced by their unfavorable pharmacokinetics. Delivering glucocorticoids by means of nanotechnologies is promising but the encapsulation of highly crystalline and poorly water-soluble drugs results in poor loading and low stability. We report here the design of 130 nm nanoparticles made of solely dexamethasone palmitate, stabilized by polyethylene glycol-linked phospholipids displaying a negative zeta potential (-55 mV), high entrapment efficiency and stability over 21 days under storage at 4 °C. X ray diffraction showed no crystallization of the drug. When incubated in serum, nanoparticles released free dexamethasone which explains the in vitro anti-inflammatory effect on LPS-activated RAW 264.7 macrophages. Moreover, we demonstrate in a murine collagen-induced arthritis model the improved therapeutic efficacy of these nanoparticles. Their passive accumulation in arthritic joints leads to disease remission and recovery of the joint structure at a dose of 1 mg/kg dexamethasone, without any adverse effects. Dexamethasone palmitate nanoparticles are promising in the treatment of inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis with a very significant difference occurring at the late stage of inflammation allowing to prevent the progression of the disease.",Use of MRI-Guided Biopsy for Selection and Follow-up of Men Undergoing Hemi-gland Cryoablation of Prostate Cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659903,Urology,2019 06 13,"To investigate safety, efficacy, and quality of life impact of hemi-gland cryotherapy for clinically-significant prostate cancer (CaP), when patient selection and follow-up includes MRI-guided biopsy.",Ex-vivo Imaging of Upper Tract Urothelial Carcinoma Using Novel ICG-Var3 pHLIP Imaging Agent.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659902,Urology,2019 01 19,"To improve visualization of upper tract urothelial carcinomas (UTUC).

A great number of miRNAs play important role in the regulation of signaling pathways in normal and cancer cells. Here, we predicted hsa-miR-5195-3p (miR-5195-3p) as a potential regulator of TGFβ signaling and investigated its effect on TGFB-R1, TGFB-R2, SMAD2, SMAD3 and SMAD4 transcripts which are key players of TGFβ/SMAD signaling pathway. Overexpression of miR-5195 in HCT116 cells resulted in a significant reduction of TGFB-R1, SMAD2, SMAD3, and SMAD4 at the mRNA level which was confirmed using RT-qPCR. Consistently, western blot analysis confirmed that miR-5195 overexpression in HCT116 cells resulted in downregulation of TGFBR1 at the protein level. Furthermore, dual luciferase analysis verified the direct interaction of miR-5195 with TGFB-R1 and SMAD4 3'UTR sequences in SW480 cells. Additionally, flow cytometry analysis confirmed that miR-5195 overexpression significantly increased the sub-G1 and decreased the G-1 cell populations in both SW480 and HCT116 cell lines. Finally, miR-5195 overexpression significantly downregulated c-MYC and cyclin D1 but upregulated p21 genes. Overall, our results indicated that miR-5195 modulates TGFβ signaling pathway and affects the cell cycle progression through targeting TGFB-R1, TGFB-R2, SMAD2, SMAD3, SMAD4 transcripts.",Nicotine Evoked Currents in Human Primary Sensory Neurons.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659887,The journal of pain : official journal of the American Pain Society,2019 03 29,"Sensory neuron nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) contribute to pain associated with tissue injury. However, there are marked differences between rats and mice with respect to both the properties and distribution of nAChR currents in sensory neurons. Because both species are used to understand pain signaling in humans, we sought to determine whether the currents present in either species was reflective of those present in human sensory neurons. Neurons from the L4/L5 dorsal root ganglia were obtained from adult male and female organ donors. Nicotine evoked currents were detected in 40 of 47 neurons (85%). In contrast with the naïve mouse, in which almost all nAChR currents are transient, or the rat, in which both mouse-like transient and more slowly activating and inactivating currents are detected, all the currents in human DRG neurons were slow, but slower than those in the rat. Currents were blocked by the nAChR antagonists mecamylamine (30 µmol/L), but not by the TRPA1 selective antagonist HC-030031 (10 µmol/L). Single cell polymerase chain reaction analysis of nicotinic receptor subunit expression in human DRG neurons are consistent with functional data indicating that receptor expression is detected 85 ± 2.1% of neurons assessed (n = 48, from 4 donors). The most prevalent coexpression pattern was α3/β2 (95 ± 4% of neurons with subunits), but α7 subunits were detected in 70 ± 3.4% of neurons. These results suggest that there are not only species differences in the sensory neuron distribution of nAChR currents between rodent and human, but that the subunit composition of the channel underlying human nAChR currents may be different from those in the mouse or rat. PERSPECTIVE: The properties and distribution of nicotine evoked currents in human sensory neurons were markedly different from those previously observed in mice and rats. These observations add additional support to the suggestion that human sensory neurons may be an essential screening tool for those considering moving novel therapeutics targeting primary afferents into clinical trials.",Coding and decoding of oscillatory Ca2+ signals.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659886,Seminars in cell & developmental biology,2019 01 28,"About 30 years after their first observation, Ca2+ oscillations are now recognised as a universal mechanism of signal transduction. These oscillations are driven by periodic cycles of release and uptake of Ca2+ between the cytoplasm and the endoplasmic reticulum. Their frequency often increases with the level of stimulation, which can be decoded by some molecules. However, it is becoming increasingly evident that the widespread core oscillatory mechanism is modulated in many ways, depending on the cell type and on the physiological conditions. Interplay with inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate metabolism and with other Ca2+ stores as the extracellular medium or mitochondria can much affect the properties of these oscillations. In many cases, these finely tuned characteristics of Ca2+ oscillations impact the physiological response that is triggered by the signal. Moreover, oscillations are intrinsically irregular. This randomness can also be exploited by the cell. In this review, we discuss evidences of these additional manifestations of the versatility of Ca2+ signalling.",Methylmercury's chemistry: From the environment to the mammalian brain.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659885,Biochimica et biophysica acta. General subjects,2019 02 17,"Methylmercury is a neurotoxicant that is found in fish and rice. MeHg's toxicity is mediated by blockage of -SH and -SeH groups of proteins. However, the identification of MeHg's targets is elusive. Here we focus on the chemistry of MeHg in the abiotic and biotic environment. The toxicological chemistry of MeHg is complex in metazoans, but at the atomic level it can be explained by exchange reactions of MeHg bound to -S(e)H with another free -S(e)H group (R1S(e)-HgMe + R2-S(e)H ↔ R1S(e)H + R2-S(e)-HgMe). This reaction was first studied by professor Rabenstein and here it is referred as the ""Rabenstein's Reaction"". The absorption, distribution, and excretion of MeHg in the environment and in the body of animals will be dictated by Rabenstein's reactions. The affinity of MeHg by thiol and selenol groups and the exchange of MeHg by Rabenstein's Reaction (which is a diffusion controlled reaction) dictates MeHg's neurotoxicity. However, it is important to emphasize that the MeHg exchange reaction velocity with different types of thiol- and selenol-containing proteins will also depend on protein-specific structural and thermodynamical factors. New experimental approaches and detailed studies about the Rabenstein's reaction between MeHg with low molecular mass thiol (LMM-SH) molecules (cysteine, GSH, acetyl-CoA, lipoate, homocysteine) with abundant high molecular mass thiol (HMM-SH) molecules (albumin, hemoglobin) and HMM-SeH (GPxs, Selenoprotein P, TrxR1-3) are needed. The study of MeHg migration from -S(e)-Hg- bonds to free -S(e)H groups (Rabenstein's Reaction) in pure chemical systems and neural cells (with special emphasis to the LMM-SH and HMM-S(e)H molecules cited above) will be critical to developing realistic constants to be used in silico models that will predict the distribution of MeHg in humans.",Structure and proteolytic susceptibility of the inhibitory C-terminal tail of cardiac troponin I.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659884,Biochimica et biophysica acta.

General subjects,2019 03 29,"Methylmercury (MeHg) is a toxic chemical compound naturally produced mainly in the aquatic environment through the methylation of inorganic mercury catalyzed by aquatic microorganisms. MeHg is biomagnified in the aquatic food chain and, consequently, piscivorous fish at the top of the food chain possess huge amounts of MeHg (at the ppm level). Some populations that have fish as main protein's source can be exposed to exceedingly high levels of MeHg and develop signs of toxicity. MeHg is toxic to several organs, but the central nervous system (CNS) represents a preferential target, especially during development (prenatal and early postnatal periods). Though the biochemical events involved in MeHg-(neuro)toxicity are not yet entirely comprehended, a vast literature indicates that its pro-oxidative properties explain, at least partially, several of its neurotoxic effects. As result of its electrophilicity, MeHg interacts with (and oxidize) nucleophilic groups, such as thiols and selenols, present in proteins or low-molecular weight molecules. It is noteworthy that such interactions modify the redox state of these groups and, therefore, lead to oxidative stress and impaired function of several molecules, culminating in neurotoxicity. Among these molecules, glutathione (GSH; a major thiol antioxidant) and thiol- or selenol-containing enzymes belonging to the GSH antioxidant system represent key molecular targets involved in MeHg-neurotoxicity. In this review, we firstly present a general overview concerning the neurotoxicity of MeHg. Then, we present fundamental aspects of the GSH-antioxidant system, as well as the effects of MeHg on this system.",Fabrication of Konjac glucomannan-based composite hydrogel crosslinked by calcium hydroxide for promising lacrimal plugging purpose.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659881,International journal of biological macromolecules,2019 03 02,"Swelling, mechanical strength, flexibility, and toughness are important parameters in hydrogel preparation for application in the human body. Herein, composite hydrogels were prepared using a mix of Konjac glucomannan (KGM), sodium alginate (SA), and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) cross-linked by calcium hydroxide. The PVA/KGM/SA composite hydrogel showed a suitable swelling ratio and rate, as well as elasticity and flexibility. In addition, the elongation at break was 660.3%, with a breaking strength of 87.25 kPa and a compression modulus of 1.660 MPa. Rheological studies showed that the composite hydrogel was composed of a multiply cross-linked network involving chemical and physical interactions, thereby affecting the elasticity and flexibility of the gel. Interestingly, the composite gel network was reformed when the temperature decreased. In rabbit models of dry eye, the hydrogel effectively maintained the normal tear meniscus height and increased the low tear meniscus area. The results therefore showed that the PVA/KGM/SA gels not only provide a simple, effective, and safe method for the preparation of hydrogels, but also have potential applications in the treatment of dry eye syndrome.",Catalytic biosynthesis of levan and short-chain fructooligosaccharides from sucrose-containing feedstocks by employing the levansucrase from Leuconostoc mesenteroides MTCC10508.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659880,International journal of biological macromolecules,2019 03 02,"Levansucrase gene (LmLEVS) was cloned from Leuconostoc mesenteroides MTCC 10508. The heterologous expression and purification of the truncated (TrLmLEVS) gene, lacking the N-terminal signal peptide, was performed in Escherichia coli. The recombinant enzyme (TrLmLEVS) was physico-kinetically characterized using sucrose as substrate. TrLmLEVS exhibited the maximum activity at pH 6 and temperature 30 °C. Thin layer chromatography and high performance liquid chromatography analyses unveiled the biosynthesis of fructooligosaccharides and levan by TrLmLEVS using sucrose as substrate. The catalytically synthesized polymer was characterized by Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance analyses, confirming it as levan. TrLmLEVS was capable of catalyzing the transformation of raffinose-derived molecules, besides sucrose, into fructans. Further, TrLmLEVS was employed for the genesis of non-digestible fructans from sucrose-containing feedstocks like table sugar, jaggery, cane molasses, and sweet sorghum juice. The results suggest that Leu. mesenteroides MTCC 10508 levansucrase is a potential candidate for the production of levan-type biomolecules in plant-based food products.",Effect of Ethylene/butyl methacrylate/Glycidyl Methacrylate Terpolymer on toughness and biodegradation of poly (l-lactic acid).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659879,International journal of biological macromolecules,2019 03 02,"The super toughed poly(l-lactic acid) (PLLA) blends with various content of Ethylene/butyl methacrylate/Glycidyl Methacrylate Terpolymer (GEBMA) were prepared by melt compounding. The blend was an immiscible system but had good compatibility due to the chemical reaction between the epoxy groups of GEBMA and the end group of PLLA during the blending process. The addition of GEBMA suppressed the cold crystallization and non-isothermal melt crystallization of PLLA. GEBMA was a very effective toughening agent for PLLA. The addition of only 15 wt% GEBMA, the elongation at break and impact strength of the blend were significantly improved compared to neat PLLA, which were 63 and 18 times that of neat PLLA, respectively. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the impact fracture surfaces of the blends showed a large amount of cavities and plastic deformation in the blend, which induced energy dissipation and therefore led to the improvement in toughness of the PLLA/GEBMA blends. For the PLLA/GEBMA blown films, the addition of GEBMA significantly improved the flexibility of PLLA/GEBMA blown film. The tear strength reached a maximum of 143.5 kN/m in the machine direction (MD) and 166.7 kN/m in the transverse direction (TD). Moreover, the biodegradation of PLLA was enhanced after blends preparation."

Over the past decades, research efforts into phenotyping of severe asthma and defining the pathological mechanisms of this disease were successful largely due to the development of appropriate animal models. Recent identification of distinct inflammatory patterns of severe asthma endotypes led to novel treatment approaches, including targeting specific cytokines or their receptors with neutralizing antibodies.

In SSTs, the P3 event-related potential following stop-signals is considered to be a neural index of motor inhibition. However, a similar P3 deflection is often observed following infrequent events in non-inhibition tasks. Moreover, within SSTs, stop-signals are indeed infrequent events, presenting a systematic confound that hampers the interpretation of the stop-signal P3 (and other candidate neural indices of motor inhibition). Therefore, we performed two studies to test whether the stop-signal P3 is uniquely related to motor inhibition or reflects infrequency detection. In Study 1, participants completed the SST and a visually identical change-detection task requiring the detection of a task-relevant, frequent signal (but not motor inhibition). We observed a P3 associated with motor inhibition in the SST, but no such positivity in the change-detection task. In Study 2, we modified the change-detection task. Some task-relevant events were now infrequent, matching the frequency of stop-signals in the SST. These events indeed evoked a P3, though of smaller amplitude than the P3 in the SST. Independent component analysis suggested that stop-signal P3 and infrequency-P3 ERPs were non-independent and shared a common neural generator. Further analyses suggested that this common neural process likely reflects motor inhibition in both tasks: infrequent events in the change-detection task lead to a non-instructed, incidental slowing of motor responding, the degree of which was strongly correlated with P3 amplitude. These results have wide-reaching implications for the interpretation of neural signals in both stop-signal and infrequency/oddball-tasks.",Avian model to mitigate gut-derived immune response and oxidative stress during heat.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659866,Bio Systems,2019 06 06,"The tissue injury at the early stages of the heat stress response triggers release of inflammatory and oxidative agents from intestinal content into the milieu of the body. Intestinal homeostasis (i.e., eubiosis) improves the barrier function and mitigates the gut-derived influx of endotoxins. In this study we have analyzed the mitigating role of embryonic stimulation of the gut homeostasis in chickens on immune and oxidative responses to heat. The animal trial was conducted on broiler chickens. The treatment included a single in ovo injection of the galactooligosaccharides (GOS) prebiotic into the air cell of the egg on day 12 of incubation. Control eggs were in ovo injected with the same volume of sterile physiological saline. After hatching, birds were raised in group pens (6 pens/group, 25 birds/pen). Short-term, mild heat stress was induced on day 32 post-hatching by increase in the ambient temperature above the thermal comfort (30 °C for 8.5 h). The spleen was harvested from randomly selected individuals. The relative gene expression study was conducted with RT-qPCR. The two gene panels were analyzed: (1) immune response genes (IL-1β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-12p40 and IL-17) and (2) stress response genes (HSP25, HSP70, HSP90, BAG3, CAT and SOD). Data were evaluated by the analysis of variance in a 2 × 2 factorial design that included in ovo treatment and ambient temperature as factors. We have found that the immune-related and stress-related gene expression signatures were triggered in animals subjected to heat but with unbalanced intestinal flora (i.e., dysbiotic, without in ovo stimulation with GOS). These animals had increased expression of the genes involved in the immune responses (IL-4 and IL17) and stress responses (HSP25, HSP70, HSP90, CAT and SOD) to short-term heat stress that indicated presence of inflammatory and oxidative mediators (P <  0.05). The individuals that were in ovo stimulated with GOS did not mount the anti-inflammatory or antioxidative responses. Heat shock proteins (HSP25 and HSP70) were increased in both groups challenged with heat, which indicated their role in adaptation to heat.",Patchy spread patterns in three-species bistable systems with facultative mutualism.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659865,Bio Systems,2019 02 04,"A three-species population system under a facultative mutualistic relationship of one of the species is studied. The considered interactions are as follows: facultative between the first species and the second species, obligatory mutualism between the second species and the first one, and the third species is a predator of the first species. For this purpose, we extend the model proposed by Morozov et al., originally used to describe obligatory mutualism, to consider obligatory and facultative mutualism and prove that under adequately selected parameters this system produces a spatial patchy spread of populations or continuous wave fronts. Since the analytical treatment of a three-species model is often prohibitive, we first analyze the interaction between two mutualist species without diffusion and without the presence of the predator. Some parameters are fixed in the bistable regime of the mutualistic species to further consider the influence of the third species. The remaining parameters are then selected to produce patchy patterns under different mortality rates. Finally, the equations of the final three-species system are numerically solved to test the influence of different initial conditions in the formation of patchy populations. It is confirmed that the velocity and the profile of a traveling front are independent on the initial conditions. Our approach opens the way to study more general biological situations.","Auditory spatial attention modulates the unmasking effect of perceptual separation in a ""cocktail party"" environment.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659864,Neuropsychologia,2019 05 19,"The perceptual separation between a signal speech and a competing speech (masker), induced by the precedence effect, plays an important role in releasing the signal speech from the masker, especially in a reverberant environment. The perceptual-separation-induced unmasking effect has been suggested to involve multiple cognitive processes, such as selective attention. However, whether listeners' spatial attention modulate the perceptual-separation-induced unmasking effect is not clear. The present study investigated how perceptual separation and auditory spatial attention interact with each other to facilitate speech perception under a simulated noisy and reverberant environment by analyzing the cortical auditory evoked potentials to the signal speech. The results showed that the N1 wave was significantly enhanced by perceptual separation between the signal and masker regardless of whether the participants' spatial attention was directed to the signal or not. However, the P2 wave was significantly enhanced by perceptual separation only when the participants attended to the signal speech. The results indicate that the perceptual-separation-induced facilitation of P2 needs more attentional resource than that of N1. The results also showed that the signal speech caused an enhanced N1 in the contralateral hemisphere regardless of whether participants' attention was directed to the signal or not. In contrast, the signal speech caused an enhanced P2 in the contralateral hemisphere only when the participant attended to the signal. The results indicate that the hemispheric distribution of N1 is mainly affected by the perceptual features of the acoustic stimuli, while that of P2 is affected by the listeners' attentional status.",Examining the neural correlates of within-category discrimination in face and non-face expert recognition.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659863,Neuropsychologia,2019 05 19,"While expert face discrimination develops naturally in humans, expert discrimination in non-face object categories, such as birds, cars and dogs, is acquired through years of experience and explicit practice. The current study used an implicit visual discrimination paradigm and electroencephalography (EEG) - Fast Periodic Visual Stimulation - to examine whether within-category discrimination of faces and non-face objects of expertise rely on shared mechanisms despite their distinct learning histories. Electroencephalogram was recorded while bird experts and bird novices viewed 60 s sequences of bird images or face images presented at a periodic rate of six images per second (i.e., 6.0 Hz). In the sequence, an adapting base image of a family-level bird (e.g., robin), a species-level bird (e.g., purple finch) or a face (e.g., Face A) was presented repeatedly for four consecutive cycles, followed by a different within-category ""oddball"" image at every fifth cycle (e.g., warbler, house finch, Face B). A differential response between the adapting base and the oddball images (6.0 Hz/fifth cycle = 1.20 Hz) provided an index of within-category discriminability. The results showed that both experts and novices demonstrated a robust EEG signal of equal magnitudes to the 6.00 Hz base face and bird images at medial-occipital channels and to the oddball 1.20 Hz face and bird images at the more anterior occipito-temporal channels. To examine whether the responses to faces and birds were generated by shared neural mechanisms, we correlated the responses to birds and faces at the participant-level. For the base signal at medial-occipital channels, all object categories positively correlated in both the experts and the novices, as expected given that the base signal indexes visual responses that are shared by all object categories (e.g., low-level). In contrast, for the discrimination signal at the more anterior occipito-temporal channels, the response to family- and species-level birds positively correlated with faces for the experts, but no face-bird association was found for the novices. These findings indicate the existence of partially shared neural mechanisms for within-category discrimination of faces and birds in the experts, but not in the novices.","Comparison of amnesic, paralytic and lipophilic toxins profiles in cockle (Acanthocardia tuberculata) and smooth clam (Callista chione) from the central Adriatic Sea (Croatia).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659862,Toxicon : official journal of the International Society on Toxinology,2019 02 21,"Searching for Amnesic (ASP), Paralytic (PSP) and Lipophilic (LT) toxins in seafood is of great importance for consumer protection.

HPLC-FLD with pre-column oxidation and HPLC-UV-DAD methods were employed for PSP and ASP toxins determination, respectively, while LTs were determined by LC-MS/MS. This research had revealed the differences in the accumulation of ASP, PSP and LT toxins between the two studied species, as Acanthocardia tuberculata showed more diverse profile with higher concentrations of analysed toxins. Both investigated shellfish species had shown levels of these biotoxins under the legal limits set by the European Commission.",Critical issues in application of molecular methods to environmental virology.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659861,Journal of virological methods,2019 02 20,"Waterborne diseases have significant public health and socioeconomic implications worldwide. Many viral pathogens are commonly associated with water-related diseases, namely enteric viruses. Also, novel recently discovered human-associated viruses have been shown to be a causative agent of gastroenteritis or other clinical symptoms. A wide range of analytical methods is available for virus detection in environmental water samples. Viral isolation is historically carried out via propagation on permissive cell lines; however, some enteric viruses are difficult or not able to propagate on existing cell lines. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) screening of viral nucleic acid is routinely used to investigate virus contamination in water due to the high sensitivity and specificity. Additionally, the introduction of metagenomic approaches into environmental virology has facilitated the discovery of viruses that cannot be grown in cell culture. This review (i) highlights the applications of molecular techniques in environmental virology such as PCR and its modifications to overcome the critical issues associated with the inability to discriminate between infectious viruses and nonviable viruses, (ii) outlines the strengths and weaknesses of Nucleic Acid Sequence Based Amplification (NASBA) and microarray, (iii) discusses the role of digital PCR as an emerging water quality monitoring assay and its advantages over qPCR, (iv) addresses the viral metagenomics in terms of detecting emerging viral pathogens and diversity in aquatic environment. Indeed, there are many challenges for selecting methods to detect classic and emerging viruses in environmental samples. While the existing techniques have revealed the importance and diversity of viruses in the water environment, further developments are necessary to enable more rapid and accurate methodologies for viral water quality monitoring and regulation.",Brain region-specific effects of long-term caloric restriction on redox balance of the aging rat.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659860,Mechanisms of ageing and development,2019 03 26,"Caloric restriction (CR) is the most effective intervention to improve health span and extend lifespan in preclinical models. This anti-aging effect of CR is related to attenuation of oxidative damage in various tissues, with divergent results in the brain. We addressed how brain oxidoreductive balance would be modulated in male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats submitted to a 40% CR from 8 to 19 months of age, by reference to ad libitum-fed (AL) rats at 2 and 19 months of age. Four brain structures were compared: hippocampus, striatum, parietal cortex, cerebellum. Our CR diet elicits significant prevention of oxidative damages with the upregulation of antioxidant defenses (levels of glutathione [GSH], mRNAs of clusterin and of three key antioxidant enzymes) as compared to age-matched AL controls, in a strikingly region-specific pattern. CR also prevented a drastic rise of the glial fibrillary acidic protein in the hippocampus of old AL rats. Besides, the CR effects at age 19 months mainly consist in improving endogenous defenses before the onset of age-related redox alterations. These effects are more prominent in the hippocampus.",Assessment of white rot fungus mediated hardwood degradation by FTIR spectroscopy and multivariate analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659858,Journal of microbiological methods,2019 02 06,"Evaluating the biomass degradation using fast, validate and sensitive techniques for exploratory purposes of biofuel production has been developed since last decade. Thus, we assessed the degradation of two Indian hardwoods using FTIR and chemometric approaches. Two white rot fungi, namely Pseudolagarobasidium acaciicola AGST3 and Tricholoma giganteum AGDR1, were selected among twenty-one fungal isolates for higher hardwood degradation. In the screening, P. acaciicola AGST3 and T. giganteum AGDR1 depicted the dry woody mass loss of 20.51% and 22.38%, respectively. Cellulose crystallinity of P. acaciicola AGST3 treated hardwoods was 4-fold lower than untreated hardwoods, showing the higher cellulose degradation efficiency. P. acaciicola AGST3 treated samples exhibited maximum deviation of guaiacyl units of lignin, cellulose and hemicelluloses. T. giganteum AGDR1 treated hardwoods showed maximum deviation of guaiacyl- and syringyl- units of lignin and hemicelluloses. Multivariate approach revealed the degradation patterns and preferences are varied based on the fungi and hardwood. The approach used in the present study can certainly distinguish the variations among the different biomass samples that having similar composition. Additionally, higher lignin degradability of these fungi can be used in biomass pretreatment, which significantly utilized to produce second-generation biofuels."

Consequently, modulation of ER activity has been exploited to develop drugs against ER + breast cancer, such as tamoxifen, referred to as endocrine therapies. With deeper understanding of ER mechanism of action, posttranslational modifications (PTMs) are increasingly recognized as important in mediating ER activity. Some ER PTMs such as phosphorylation, are studied in the context of ligand-independent ER activity. However, they also play a pivotal role in defining the actions and outcome of the antiestrogen-bound ER. The complexity of these actions is increasing as new PTMs are identified, yet the functional consequences and clinical implications are not fully understood. This review will examine and summarize new emerging mechanistic knowledge and clinical data in breast cancer on how these PTMs affect antiestrogen-ER activity, with an emphasis on phosphorylation of serine 305 (S305). This phosphorylation site represents an integrated hub of oncogenic signaling to modulate ER conformation, dimerization, coregulators, and DNA binding to profoundly reduce sensitivity to endocrine therapy. Consequently, (i) S305 has the potential to become a useful marker of tamoxifen response, and (ii) blocking S305 phosphorylation defines a new therapeutic strategy to overcome tamoxifen resistance in breast cancer.",Relaxin-2 for heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF): Rationale for future clinical trials.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659842,Molecular and cellular endocrinology,2019 04 07,"Heart Failure with preserved Ejection Fraction (HFpEF), a distinct sub-entity of chronic heart failure characterized by generalized inflammatory non-compliance of the cardio-vascular system, is associated with high mortality and still an unmet medical need. Many novel and promising therapeutic approaches have failed in large studies. This review focuses on basic research, pre-clinical and clinical findings that may account for the potential benefit of relaxin-2 in HFpEF. The peptide combines short-term hemodynamic advantages, such as moderate blood pressure decline and functional endothelin-1 antagonism, with a wealth of protective effects harboring long-term benefits, such as anti-inflammatory, anti-fibrotic, and anti-oxidative actions. These pleiotropic effects are exerted through a complex and intricate signaling cascade involving the relaxin-family peptide receptor-1, the glucocorticoid receptor, the nitric oxide system, and a cell type-dependent variety of down-stream mediators.",Recurrent binge ethanol is associated with significant loss of dentate gyrus granule neurons in female rats despite concomitant increase in neurogenesis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659841,Neuropharmacology,2019 05 19,"Binge drinking is becoming increasingly common among American women and girls. We have previously shown significant cell loss, downregulation of neurotrophins and microgliosis in female rats after a single 4-day ethanol exposure. To determine whether recurrent binge exposure would produce similar effects, we administered ethanol (5 g/kg) or iso-caloric control diet once-weekly for 11 weeks to adult female rats. As we have previously shown exercise neuroprotection against binge-induced damage, half the rats were given access to exercise wheels. Blood ethanol concentration (BEC) did not differ between sedentary and exercised groups, nor did it change across time. Using stereology, we quantified the number and/or size of neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG), as well as the number and activation state of microglia. Binged sedentary rats had significant cell loss in the dentate gyrus, but exercise eliminated this effect. Compared to sedentary controls, sedentary binged rats and all exercised rats showed increased neurogenesis in the DG. Number and nuclear volume of neurons in the mPFC were not changed. In the hippocampus and mPFC, the number of microglia with morphology indicative of partial activation was increased by recurrent binge ethanol and decreased by exercise. In summary, we show significant binge-induced loss of DG granule neurons despite increased neurogenesis, suggesting an unsuccessful compensatory response. Although exercise eliminated cell loss, our results indicate that infrequent, but recurrent exposure to clinically relevant BEC is neurotoxic.",cAMP-producing chemogenetic and adenosine A2a receptor activation inhibits the inwardly rectifying potassium current in striatal projection neurons.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659840,Neuropharmacology,2019 05 19,"Adenosine A2a receptors (A2aRs) are highly and selectively expressed in D2-medium spiny neurons (D2-MSNs) that also express a high level of dopamine D2 receptors (D2Rs). However, it was not established how A2aR activity affects D2-MSN excitability, let alone the ion channels involved. We have performed two sets of experiments to determine the potential A2aR agonistic effects on D2-MSN intrinsic excitability and the underlying ion channel mechanism. First, we have used the cAMP-producing, Gαs/olf coupled designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drug (Gs-DREADDs) to phenocopy cAMP-stimulating A2aR activation. We found that activation of Gs-DREADD inhibited the inwardly rectifying potassium current (Kir)-a key regulator of MSN excitability, caused a depolarization, increased input resistance, and substantially increased the intrinsic excitability of MSNs such that depolarizing inputs evoked many more action potentials. Second, we have determined that A2aR agonism produced these same excitatory effects on D2-MSN intrinsic excitability and spike firing, although at lower magnitudes than those induced by Gs-DREADD activation; furthermore, these A2aR-triggered excitatory effects were intact in the presence of a D2R antagonist. Taken together, these results clearly establish that in striatal D2-MSNs, A2aR activation can independently inhibit Kir and increase intrinsic excitability and spike and neurotransmitter output; our results also indicate that Gs-DREADD can serve as a broadly useful positive control for neurotransmitter receptors that increase intracellular cAMP levels and hence facilitate the determination of the cellular effects of these neurotransmitter receptors.",Shaky ground - The nature of metastable GPCR signalling complexes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659839,Neuropharmacology,2019 05 05,"How G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) interact with one another remains an area of active investigation. Obligate dimers of class C GPCRs such as metabotropic GABA and glutamate receptors are well accepted, although whether this is a general feature of other GPCRs is still strongly debated. In this review, we focus on the idea that GPCR dimers and oligomers are better imagined as parts of larger metastable signalling complexes. We discuss the nature of functional oligomeric entities, their stabilities and kinetic features and how structural and functional asymmetries of such metastable entities might have implications for drug discovery.

Kappa opioid receptors (KOR) are involved in alcohol reward and in the effects of stress. Previously, in non-dependent rats, we showed that KOR in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) mediate reinstatement of alcohol seeking induced by the selective KOR agonist U50,488. Here, we determine the effects of chronic, intermittent exposure to alcohol vapor on U50,488-induced reinstatement of alcohol seeking. We also study brain mechanisms involved using the neuronal activity marker Fos and phosphorylated p38 MAPK (p-p38), an intracellular messenger implicated in the effects of KOR stimulation. We trained male Long-Evans rats to self-administer alcohol (12% w/v) and exposed them to alcohol vapor (14 h vapor/10 h air) daily for 24 d or to the control condition, extinguished alcohol-reinforced responding and determined the dose response for U50,488-induced reinstatement. We then determined the effects of vapor exposure on U50,488-induced Fos and p-p38 expression. Vapor-exposed rats were more sensitive to U50,488-induced reinstatement. U50,488 increased Fos expression in brain areas involved in stress-induced relapse, and Fos activation in the ventral BNST was greater in vapor exposed rats. Vapor exposed rats had increased basal p-p38 expression in the dorsal BNST, LC and NTS. Our findings suggest that changes in the neuronal responses to KOR stimulation in the ventral BNST may be involved in the increased sensitivity to U50,488 accompanying dependence.",DNA methyltransferase 1 and Krüppel-like factor 4 axis regulates macrophage inflammation and atherosclerosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659837,Journal of molecular and cellular cardiology,2019 06 10,"Macrophage-mediated inflammatory responses occur throughout all stages of atherosclerosis. DNA methylation is one of the critical epigenetic mechanisms and is associated with the development of atherosclerosis. The underlying mechanism of epigenetic regulation of macrophage inflammation (M1 activation) remains unclear. Here we aim to study the role of DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) in modulating macrophage inflammation and atherosclerosis. DNMT1 expression is up-regulated in THP-1-derived macrophages upon treatment with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and interferon-gamma (IFN-γ). Overexpression of DNMT1 promotes the LPS- and IFN-γ-induced M1 activation whereas inhibition of DNMT1 attenuates it. Consistently, DNMT1 expression is elevated in macrophages in atherosclerotic plaques from human and mouse specimens; compared with the Dnmt1wild-type, myeloid Dnmt1 deficiency in mice in an Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) knockout background or receiving AAV-PSCK9 injection and carotid partial ligation results in ameliorated atheroma formation and suppressed plaque inflammation. The promoter regions of atheroprotective Krüppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) are hypermethylated in M1- activated macrophages. DNMT1 down-regulates the expression of KLF4, probably through catalyzing DNA methylation of the promoter regions of KLF4. Gain- and loss-of function study of KLF4 indicates that the DNMT1-mediated macrophage M1 activation is dependent on KLF4. Our data demonstrate a proatherogenic role for DNMT1 as a defining factor in macrophage inflammation both in vitro and in vivo. DNMT1 promotes macrophage M1 activation by suppressing KLF4 expression. Thus macrophage-specific DNMT1 inhibition may provide an attractive therapeutic potential to prevent or reduce atherosclerosis.",Development and validation of different indirect ELISAs for MERS-CoV serological testing.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659836,Journal of immunological methods,2019 02 05,"Since 2012, MERS-CoV has caused up to 2220 cases and 790 deaths in 27 countries with Saudi Arabia being the most affected country with ~83.1% of the cases and ~38.8% local death rate. Current serological assays such as microneutralization (MN), plaque reduction neutralization, immunofluorescence, protein microarray or pseudoparticle neutralization assays rely on handling of live MERS-CoV in high containment laboratories or need for expensive and special equipment and reagents and highly trained personnel which represent a technical hurdle for most laboratories in resource-limited MERS-CoV endemic countries. Here, we developed, compared and evaluated three different indirect ELISAs based on MERS-CoV nucleocapsid protein (N), spike (S) ectodomain (amino acids 1-1297) and S1 subunit (amino acids 1-725) and compared them with MN assay. The developed ELISAs were evaluated using large number of confirmed seropositive (79 samples) and seronegative (274 samples) MERS-CoV human serum samples. Both rS1- and rS-ELISAs maintained high sensitivity and specificity (≥90%) across a wider range of OD values compared to rN-ELISA. Moreover, rS1- and rS-based ELISAs showed better agreement and correlation with MN assay in contrast to rN-ELISA. Collectively, our data demonstrate that rS1-ELISA and rS-ELISA are more reliable than rN-ELISA and represent a suitable choice for seroepidemiological testing and surveillance in MERS-CoV endemic regions.",Endoscopist biopsy rate as a quality indicator for outpatient gastroscopy: a multicenter cohort study with validation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659831,Gastrointestinal endoscopy,2019 05 20,"The diagnosis of gastric premalignant conditions (GPCs) relies on endoscopy with mucosal sampling.

These viral receptors are intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (used by the majority of RV-A and all RV-B types), low-density lipoprotein receptor family members (used by 12 RV-A types), and cadherin-related family member 3 (CDHR3; used by RV-C). RV-A and RV-B interactions with intercellular adhesion molecule 1 and low-density lipoprotein receptor glycoproteins are well defined and their cellular functions have been described, whereas the mechanisms of the RV-C interaction with CDHR3 and its cellular functions are being studied. A single nucleotide polymorphism (rs6967330) in CDHR3 increases cell surface expression of this protein and, as a result, also promotes RV-C infections and illnesses.

This study aimed to detect the activity of Pluronics® P-123 and F-127 themselves since there is a scarcity of data on these NP activities without drugs incorporation. This study evaluated, in vitro, the activity of Pluronics® against promastigotes and amastigotes of Leishmania amazonensis and also their cytotoxicities. Additionally, the determination of the mitochondria membrane potential in promastigotes, internalization of these Pluronics® in the parasite membrane and macrophages and its stability in the culture medium was evaluated. Results showed that Pluronics® did not cause significant damage to human red cells and promastigotes. The P-123 and F-127 inhibited the survival rate of L. amazonensis amastigotes, and also presented loss of mitochondrial membrane potential on promastigotes. The Pluronics® showed low cytotoxic activity on J774A.1 macrophages, while only P-123 showed moderate cytotoxicity for BALB/c macrophages. The stability of P-123 and F-127 in culture medium was maintained for ten days. In conclusion, the NP studied can be used for incorporating potent leishmanicidal chemotherapy, due to their selectivity towards macrophages, being a promising system for the treatment of cutaneous leishmaniasis.","Phytochemical profiling, antioxidant and anticancer activities of Gastrocotyle hispida growing in Saudi Arabia.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659804,Acta tropica,2019 04 09,"The present study aimed at isolation the phytocompounds from the aerial parts of Gastrocotyle hispida and to evaluate its antioxidant and anticancer potential using in vitro assay.

The Society of Hair Testing (SoHT) recommends the direct alcohol markers ethyl glucuronide (EtG) and fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEE) for the detection of past alcohol consumption. In this study, we investigated if detox shampoos which are sold online can have an impact on EtG or FAEE concentrations in hair. According to customer reviews, positive drug testing results could be avoided after long-term incubation with shampoo under a swimming cap. To evaluate the potential of four detox shampoos, we incubated distal hair samples from three subjects, obtained during a standard haircut, for 2.5, 5, 7.5, and 10 hours. For EtG, three shampoos performed similar to deionized water. The fourth shampoo showed additional heavy washout effects with a decrease of up to 86% after 2.5 hours. For the apolar FAEE, no washout was observed. Incubation with two shampoos resulted in increases in FAEE concentrations due to FAEE being present as shampoo ingredients. Further investigation of EtG washout in proximal forensic hair samples (n = 9) with the most potent shampoo showed a mean decrease in deionized water of 23% ± 25%, and a decrease by the use of detox shampoo of 73% ± 12%, compared to non-incubated hair after 8 hours.

Dextranase (Dex), which is a type of glucanase, participates in the degradation of water-soluble glucan (WSG); however, the structural features of the EPS regulated by the dexAgene have received limited attention. Our recent studies reported novel protocols to fractionate and analyzed the structural characteristics of glucans from S mutans biofilms. In this study, we identify the role of the S mutans dexAgene in dextran-dependent aggregation in biofilm formation. Our results show that deletion of dexA (SmudexA) results in increased transcription of EPS synthesis-related genes, including gtfB, gtfD, and ftf. Interestingly, we reveal that inactivating the dexA gene may lead to elevated WSG synthesis in S mutans , which results in dysregulated cariogenicity in vivo. Furthermore, structural analysis provides new insights regarding the lack of mannose monosaccharides, especially in the WSG synthesis of the SmudexA mutants. The biofilm phenotypes that are associated with the reduced glucose monosaccharide composition in both WSG and water-insoluble glucan shift the dental biofilm to reduce the cariogenic incidence of the SmudexA mutants. Taken together, these data reveal that EPS synthesis fine-tuning by the dexA gene results in a densely packed EPS matrix that may impede the glucose metabolism of WSG, thereby leading to the lack of an energy source for the bacteria. These results highlight dexA targeting as a potentially effective tool in dental caries management.",Physical Inaccessibility of a Resistant Starch Shifts Mouse Gut Microbiota to Butyrogenic Firmicutes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659764,Molecular nutrition & food research,2019 04 22,"Resistant starch (RS) is utilized by Gram-negative Bacteroidetes through a starch utilization system (Sus), which requires physical attachment of the bacteria to the substrate.

It has been previously shown that fabricated RS [alginate-based starch-entrapped microspheres (SM)] increases butyrate in in vitro human fecal fermentation and was slow fermenting.

This effect is caused by a reversal in the dipole moment when going from S0 to T1 as fulvenes adapt to the difference in electron counts for aromaticity in various states; they are aromatic chameleons. Thus, a substituent pattern that enhances (reduces) fulvene aromaticity in S0 reduces (enhances) aromaticity in T1 , allowing for rationalizations of the triplet state energies (ET ) of substituted fulvenes. Through quantum chemical calculations, we now assess which substituents and which positions on the pentafulvene core are the most powerful for designing compounds with low or inverted ET . As a means to increase the π-electron withdrawing capacity of cyano groups, we found that protonation at the cyano N atoms of 6,6-dicyanopentafulvenes can be a route to on-demand formation of a fulvenium dication with a triplet ground state (T0 ).

Although widespread, this procedure has the potential to alter downstream population genetic inferences and has received relatively little rigorous analysis. Here we use simulations and an empirical single nucleotide polymorphism data set to demonstrate the impacts of MAF thresholds on inference of population structure-often the first step in analysis of population genomic data. We find that model-based inference of population structure is confounded when singletons are included in the alignment, and that both model-based and multivariate analyses infer less distinct clusters when more stringent MAF cutoffs are applied. We propose that this behaviour is caused by the combination of a drop in the total size of the data matrix and by correlations between allele frequencies and mutational age. We recommend a set of best practices for applying MAF filters in studies seeking to describe population structure with genomic data.",Variables of importance in the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients database predictive of heart transplant waitlist mortality.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659754,American journal of transplantation : official journal of the American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons,2019 04 10,"The prelisting variables essential for creating an accurate heart transplant allocation score based on survival are unknown.

There were 33 069 candidates awaiting heart transplantation: 7681 UNOS Status 1A, 13 027 Status 1B, and 12 361 Status 2. During a median waitlist follow-up of 4.3 months, 5514 candidates died. Variables of importance for waitlist mortality were identified by machine learning using Random Survival Forests. Strong correlates predicting survival were estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), serum albumin, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, ventricular assist device, mechanical ventilation, peak oxygen capacity, hemodynamics, inotrope support, and type of heart disease with less predictive variables including antiarrhythmic agents, history of stroke, vascular disease, prior malignancy, and prior tobacco use. Complex interactions were identified such as an additive risk in mortality based on renal function and serum albumin, and sex-differences in mortality when eGFR >40 mL/min/1.73 m. Most predictive variables for waitlist mortality are in the current tiered allocation system except for eGFR and serum albumin which have an additive risk and complex interactions."

In order to understand and improve SST performance, computational fluid dynamics methods have been employed over the last 30 years. In the present investigation, a Fluent-based two-dimensional axisymmetric numerical model is applied to understand the effects of the buoyancy term (Gb ) in the turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) equation and two model parameters (the coefficient of buoyancy term (C3 ) in the turbulent dissipation rate equation and the turbulent Schmidt number (σc ) in the sludge transport equation) on the performance of an SST. The results show that the hydrodynamics can only be correctly predicted by buoyancy-coupled TKE equation, unless the mixed liquor suspended solids is low and sludge settling velocity is extremely high. When the field observations show the SST is operating well, the buoyancy-decoupled TKE equation predicts the correct result, but the buoyancy-decoupled TKE equation may predict failure. Care is required in selecting the correct modeling technique for various conditions. This study provides guidance on how to avoid modeling problems and increase rates of convergence. PRACTITIONER POINTS: C3 can be set to zero to improve rate of convergence and reduce computing time. σc can be used to adjust SBH, when ESS and RAS concentrations are well calibrated to the field data, but the SBH does not fit field observation.",Students' self-assessment of competencies in the phantom course of operative dentistry.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659731,European journal of dental education : official journal of the Association for Dental Education in Europe,2019 04 10,"The aim was to assess the competencies of undergraduate students in their roles of dental expert, scholar, communicator, collaborator, health advocate, manager and professional.",Electrochemical Formation of Fe(IV)=O Derived from H2 O2 on a Hematite Electrode as an Active Catalytic Site for Selective Hydrocarbon Oxidation Reactions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659730,Chemphyschem : a European journal of chemical physics and physical chemistry,2019 03 19,"The high-valence iron species (Fe(IV)=O) in the cytochrome P450 enzyme superfamily is generated via the activation of O2 , and serves as the active center of selective hydrocarbon oxidation reactions.

Even migrant plants moving within their current range may experience different plant-soil feedbacks (PSF) because of divergent nonlocal biotic soil conditions. Yet, our understanding to what extent soil biotic conditions can affect the performance of within-range migrant plants is still very limited. We assessed the emergence and growth of migrant forest herbs (Milium effusum and Stachys sylvatica) using soils and seeds collected along a 1,700 km latitudinal gradient across Europe. Soil biota were manipulated through four soil treatments, i.e. unsterilized control soil (PSFUS ), sterilized soil (PSFS ), sterilized soil inoculated with unsterilized home soil (PSFS+HI ) and sterilized soil inoculated with unsterilized foreign soil (PSFS+FI , expected to occur when both plants and soil biota track climate change). Compared to PSFS , PSFUS had negative effects on the growth but not emergence of both species, while PSFS+FI only affected S. sylvatica across all seed provenances. When considering seed origin, seedling emergence and growth responses to nonlocal soils depended on soil biotic conditions. Specifically, the home-away distance effect on seedling emergence differed between the four treatments, and significant responses to chemistry either disappeared (M. effusum) or changed (S. sylvatica) from PSFUS to PSFS .

From 70th day until the 90th day of gestation, sows received either a basal diet (n = 12) or the same diet supplemented with HMB (n = 12) at the dose of 0.2 g/kg of body weight/day. Femora obtained from six males and females in each group weaned at the age of 35 days were examined. Maternal HMB treatment significantly enhanced body weight and changed bone morphology increasing femur mechanical strength in both sexes. Maternal HMB supplementation also elevated bone micro- and macroelement concentrations and enhanced content of proteoglycans in articular cartilage. Based on the obtained results, it can be concluded that maternal HMB supplementation in the mid-gestation period significantly accelerated bone development in both sexes by upregulation of a multifactorial system including leptin and osteoprotegerin. However, the sex (irrespective of the HMB treatment) was the factor which influenced the collagen structure in cartilages and trabecular bone, as demonstrated both by the Picrosirius red staining and performed analysis of thermal stability of collagenous tissues. The structural differences in collagen between males and females were presumably related to a different collagen maturity. No studies conducted so far provided a detailed morphological analysis of bone, articular cartilage, growth plate and the activities of the somatotropic and pituitary-gonadal axes, as well as leptin/osteoprotegerin system in weaned offspring prenatally treated with HMB. This study showed also the relationship between the maternal HMB treatment and bone osteometric and mechanical traits, hormones, and growth and bone turnover markers such as leptin, osteoprotegerin and insulin-like growth factor-1.",Association of vitamin D deficiency with electrocardiographic markers of left atrial abnormalities.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659705,"Annals of noninvasive electrocardiology : the official journal of the International Society for Holter and Noninvasive Electrocardiology, Inc",2019 04 22,Electrocardiographic markers of left atrial (LA) abnormalities are linked to increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD).

In recent studies, in women with various risk profiles, the sensitivity ranges between 81% and 100%, which is approximately twice as high as the sensitivity of mammography. The specificity increases in follow-up rounds to around 97%, with positive predictive values for biopsy in the same range as for mammography. MRI preferentially detects the more aggressive/invasive types of breast cancer, but has a higher sensitivity than mammography for any type of cancer. This performance implies that in women screened with breast MRI, all other examinations must be regarded as supplemental. Mammography may yield ~5% additional cancers, mostly ductal carcinoma in situ, while slightly decreasing specificity and increasing the costs. Ultrasound has no supplemental value when MRI is used. Evidence is mounting that in other groups of women the performance of MRI is likewise superior to more conventional screening techniques. Particularly in women with a personal history of breast cancer, the gain seems to be high, but also in women with a biopsy history of lobular carcinoma in situ and even women at average risk, similar results are reported. Initial outcome studies show that breast MRI detects cancer earlier, which induces a stage-shift increasing the survival benefit of screening. Cost-effectiveness is still an issue, particularly for women at lower risk. Since costs of the MRI scan itself are a driving factor, efforts to reduce these costs are essential. The use of abbreviated MRI protocols may enable more widespread use of breast MRI for screening. Level of Evidence: 1 Technical Efficacy: Stage 5 J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 2019."

However, there are still very few reports on the adsorption of organic dyes by PAFs. In this work, four new PAFs have been facilely synthesized by the polymerization of a tetrahedral-shaped (four-node) monomer with a series of three-node monomers through Suzuki-Miyaura coupling reactions. All the obtained materials possess hierarchical porous structures and show high thermal and chemical stability. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface areas of these PAFs were determined to be 857 m2  g-1 for PAF-111, 526 m2  g-1 for PAF-112A, 725 m2  g-1 for PAF-112B, and 598 m2  g-1 for PAF-113. Rhodamine B was selected as a model organic dye to test the adsorption capacities of the obtained PAF materials. PAF-111 showed a maximum adsorption capacity of 1666 mg g-1 (167 wt %) for Rhodamine B, which is among the highest values reported to date for porous organic materials. It is noteworthy that PAF-111 could be reused in at least ten cycles under the adsorption conditions without any loss of adsorption capacity. Our study has revealed the great potential and advantages of PAFs as ultrastable adsorption materials for the removal of organic dyes.",Comparison of the efficiency of different enemas on patients with distal ulcerative colitis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659678,Cell proliferation,2019 04 15,"Rectal application of steroids and 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) is associated with few side effects and has a high therapeutic efficacy in left-sided colitis.

Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the treatment choice and efficacy of these different enemas in distal ulcerative colitis (UC) patients.",A reintroduction of environmental mite allergen control strategies for asthma treatment and the debate on their effectiveness.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659677,Clinical and experimental allergy : journal of the British Society for Allergy and Clinical Immunology,2019 03 28,"Asthma affects three hundred million people worldwide. The effectiveness of house dust mite allergen control for asthma treatment is debatable. One aspect that has been little discussed in existing meta-analyses is the possible role of environmental strategies. Here, we reintroduce the previously defined strategies for mite allergen control and discuss their importance to the debate on clinical effectiveness. The strategy of concurrent bedroom interventions is related to the combined use of a priori defined interventions, while the strategy of exposure-based control relates to the treatment of relevant textiles after assessing exposure. The air purification strategy aims to purify the human breathing zone of airborne allergens. In Western European patient practice, the use of these strategies differs. A post hoc study of the dominant Cochrane review by Gøtzsche and Johansen (Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, 2008, Art. No: CD001187) appears to indicate that a majority of the underlying trials reported on the strategy of concurrent bedroom interventions, which were mainly executed in a minimal manner. Some trials have reported on the air purification strategy and may potentially alter the debate on effectiveness. No trial has reported on the strategy of exposure-based control. We therefore hypothesize that the absence of evidence for the effectiveness of mite allergen control for asthma treatment applies to the strategy of concurrent bedroom interventions. The evidence-based effectiveness of the exposure-based control strategy appears to be undetermined. The results of our post hoc reanalysis urge that future meta-analyses of mite allergen control should a priori define the environmental strategy under study. Future trials of mite allergen control are warranted to test the exposure-based strategy as well as the sparsely tested strategy of air purification.",Double transcranial direct current stimulation of the brain increases cerebral energy levels and systemic glucose tolerance in men.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659676,Journal of neuroendocrinology,2019 04 24,"Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a neuromodulatory method that has been tested experimentally and has already been used as an adjuvant therapeutic option to treat a number of neurological disorders and neuropsychiatric diseases. Beyond its well known local effects within the brain, tDCS also transiently promotes systemic glucose uptake and reduces the activity of the neurohormonal stress axes. We aimed to test whether the effects of a single tDCS application could be replicated upon double stimulation to persistently improve systemic glucose tolerance and stress axes activity in humans. In a single-blinded cross-over study, we examined 15 healthy male volunteers. Anodal tDCS vs sham was applied twice in series. Systemic glucose tolerance was investigated by the standard hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic glucose clamp procedure, and parameters of neurohormonal stress axes activity were measured. Because tDCS-induced brain energy consumption has been shown to be part of the mechanism underlying the assumed effects, we monitored the cerebral high-energy phosphates ATP and phosphocreatine by 31 phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy. As hypothesised, analyses revealed that double anodal tDCS persistently increases glucose tolerance compared to sham. Moreover, we observed a significant rise in cerebral high-energy phosphate content upon double tDCS. Accordingly, the activity of the neurohormonal stress axes was reduced upon tDCS compared to sham. Our data demonstrate that double tDCS promotes systemic glucose uptake and reduces stress axes activity in healthy humans. These effects suggest that repetitive tDCS may be a future non-pharmacological option for combating glucose intolerance in type 2 diabetes patients.","Tuning the Reactivities of the Heteronuclear [Aln V3-n O7-n ]+ (n=1, 2) Cluster Oxides towards Methane by Varying the Composition of the Metal Centers.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659675,"Chemistry (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)",2019 03 04,"The thermal gas-phase reactions of [Al2 VO5 ]+ and [AlV2 O6 ]+ with methane have been explored by using Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FT-ICR) mass spectrometry complemented by high-level quantum chemical calculations.

In the present study, we validated a protocol for the extraction of RNA from FFPE samples collected from healthy and diseased equine placenta. The quality and quantity of the extracted RNA from the FFPE and matching RNAlater™-preserved samples and expression levels of common housekeeping genes and reference microRNAs were evaluated. Precision of the expression data was evaluated by comparing relative expression of CYP19A1 and HSD3B1 in FFPE and RNAlater™ samples. The median RNA concentration recovered from FFPE samples was 316.8 ng/mm3 of tissue (ranging between 61.6 and 917.4 ng/mm3 ), average RNA integrity number was 2.3 ± 0.9 (mean ± standard deviation), and 84% of samples had RNA fragments longer than 200 nucleotides (DV200 ). RNA concentrations and CT values for GAPDH, ACTB, miR-8908a and miR-369 in FFPE samples were significantly correlated (r = -0.8, -0.7, -0.4 and -0.4, respectively; p < 0.001). Expression pattern of normalized CYP19A1 and HSD3B1 in paired FFPE and RNAlater™ samples was significantly correlated (r = 0.97 for CYP19A1 and HSD3B1; p < 0.001). This study demonstrates that RNA can be extracted from FFPE equine placental tissue and used for downstream transcriptomic analysis. Similar RNA expression patterns were obtained using RNAlater™ and FFPE tissue samples.",Rapid evolution of testis size relative to sperm morphology suggests that post-copulatory selection targets sperm number in Anolis lizards.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659673,Journal of evolutionary biology,2019 04 04,"Post-copulatory sexual selection is thought to be responsible for much of the extraordinary diversity in sperm morphology across metazoans. However, the extent to which post-copulatory selection targets sperm morphology versus sperm production is generally unknown. To address this issue, we simultaneously characterized the evolution of sperm morphology (length of the sperm head, midpiece and flagellum) and testis size (a proxy for sperm production) across 26 species of Anolis lizards, a group in which sperm competition is likely. We found that the length of the sperm midpiece has evolved 2-3 times faster than that of the sperm head or flagellum, suggesting that midpiece size may be the most important aspect of sperm morphology with respect to post-copulatory sexual selection. However, testis size has evolved faster than any aspect of sperm morphology or body size, supporting the hypothesis that post-copulatory sexual selection acts more strongly upon sperm production than upon sperm morphology. Likewise, evolutionary increases in testis size, which typically indicate increased sperm competition, are not associated with predictable changes in sperm morphology, suggesting that any effects of post-copulatory selection on sperm morphology are either weak or variable in direction across anoles. Collectively, our results suggest that sperm production is the primary target of post-copulatory sexual selection in this lineage.","Skin lesions, differential diagnosis and practical approach to potential survivors of torture.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659672,Journal of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology : JEADV,2019 04 15,"As the international refugee crisis has reached new proportions (BMJ, 355, 2016 and i5412), survivors of torture increasingly present in treating physicians with an array of acute or chronic skin lesions. Physicians should be aware of common presentations and likely differential diagnoses in order to avoid mislabelling or under-recognizing torture. Survivors of torture also frequently suffer from psychological sequelae, such as post-traumatic stress disorder, and appropriate referrals are essential in order to improve recovery trajectory. Skin sequelae are the most common physical findings of torture. Not all skin lesions seen in tortured survivors are due to perpetrator inflicted injuries, and many dermatological conditions can mimic lesions typical of torture, as can scars as a result of folk remedies or cultural practices specific to geographical regions. Medical documentation of torture includes injury and lesion description. While forensic dermatology and other forensic specialties use an injury description taxonomy, and the standard dermatologic taxonomy uses an anatomic description, they are complementary sciences for lesions inflicted by torture. This results in an opportunity for learning across disciplines in order to improve evidence documentation for survivors of torture. This article describes features of common skin lesions consistent with torture, including their clinical appearances, differential diagnoses, patterns of injury and appropriate clinical descriptions.",Effectiveness of the combination of vascular targeted photodynamic therapy and anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 in a preclinical mouse model of urothelial carcinoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659668,International journal of urology : official journal of the Japanese Urological Association,2019 03 03,To investigate the effectiveness of combination treatment of vascular targeted photodynamic therapy and anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 immunotherapy in a mouse model of urothelial carcinoma.,Seasonal and dietary effects on Vitamin D deficiencies detected in wild boar from mid-western Spain.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659667,Journal of animal physiology and animal nutrition,2019 03 06,"Vitamin D (VitD) is involved in important mammalian physiological mechanisms, such as Ca-P metabolism, bone development and immunological response. VitD deficiencies are frequently detected in domestic animals and related to various health problems (e.g., rickets, bone deformation). However, knowledge about the status of VitD in wildlife species, such as the wild boar, is scarce. The aims of this work were to explore VitD status in wild boar populations from mid-western Spain and to elucidate the influence of daylight exposure and food supplementation in levels of VitD. Serum concentration of VitD (measured as 25-hydroxivitaminD) was assessed in 276 wild boar from 27 game estates located in mid-western Spain using a commercial ELISA kit. In 19 out of 27 estates, the staff supplied a specific VitD-enriched food (2,000 UI/Kg) ad libitum throughout the year, while in the remaining estates (8), no food was supplied. Blood samples were extracted from hunted animals (198) between October and February of hunting seasons 2016/2017 and 2017/2018, and from live wild boar (78) that were captured, sampled and released (March-September of 2017). The percentage of animals with VitD deficiency (<20 ng/ml), VitD insufficiency (20-30 ng/ml) and VitD sufficiency (>30 ng/ml) was estimated, and the relationship of these levels to factors like sex, age and season was assessed using chi-square tests. Furthermore, associations between daylight exposure and supplemental food with VitD levels were explored using linear models. Of the studied wild boar population, 82.2% showed a VitD deficiency or insufficiency. VitD deficiencies were more frequent in animals sampled in winter and spring. Furthermore, levels of VitD positively correlated with daylight exposure and supplemental food intake. Ad libitum supplementation with VitD-enriched food was insufficient to prevent VitD deficiencies in wild boar from November to April, probably because food consumption is lower during this period."

Therefore, it is important to understand ageing processes at the cellular and molecular levels to predict the onset of age-related diseases and prevent them. Recent research has focused on the identification of ageing biomarkers, including those associated with the properties of the Golgi apparatus. In this context, Golgi-mediated glycosylation of proteins has been well characterized. Additionally, other studies show that the secretion of many compounds, including pro-inflammatory cytokines and extracellular matrix-degrading enzymes, is modified during ageing, resulting in physical and functional skin degradation. Since the Golgi apparatus is a central organelle of the secretory pathway, we investigated its structural organization in senescent primary human dermal fibroblasts using confocal and electron microscopy. In addition, we monitored the expression of Golgi-related genes in the same cells. Our data showed a marked alteration in the Golgi morphology during replicative senescence. In contrast to its small and compact structure in non-senescent cells, the Golgi apparatus exhibited a large and expanded morphology in senescent fibroblasts. Our data also demonstrated that the expression of many genes related to Golgi structural integrity and function was significantly modified in senescent cells, suggesting a relationship between Golgi apparatus function and ageing.",Multiomic analysis of oral keratinocytes chronically exposed to shisha.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659648,Journal of oral pathology & medicine : official publication of the International Association of Oral Pathologists and the American Academy of Oral Pathology,2019 02 16,"Tobacco is smoked in different form including cigarettes and water pipes.

However, the biological roles of miR-98 in neuropathic pain development have not been investigated. Therefore, in our current study, we focused on the effects of miR-98 in neuropathic pain. It was shown that miR-98 was significantly downregulated in chronic sciatic nerve injury (CCI) rat models. In addition, high mobility group A2 (HMGA2) was obviously upregulated in CCI rats. Overexpression of miR-98 inhibited neuropathic pain progression, including mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia. By a bioinformatics analysis, HMGA2 was predicted as a direct target of miR-98. The negative correlation between miR-98 and HMGA2 was validated in our present study. Furthermore, overexpression of miR-98 dramatically repressed HMGA2 protein and messenger RNA (mRNA) expression. Neuroinflammation participates in neural-immune interactions, which can contribute to the neuropathic pain development. Meanwhile, we found that inflammatory cytokine (interleukin [IL]-6, IL-1β, and COX-2) protein expression in rats infected with LV-miR-98 was greatly suppressed. Taking these results together, we concluded that miR-98 might depress neuropathic pain development through modulating HMGA2.","Analysis of genetic and serology of hepatitis A virus infection during and after outbreak in two junior high schools in Surabaya, Indonesia.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659645,Journal of medical virology,2019 04 12,"Outbreaks of hepatitis A have occurred in some cities in Indonesia. In Surabaya, the capital city of East Java province, Indonesia, hepatitis A outbreaks have been reported since2013, with a marked increase in the number of cases in 2015. The aim of the present study was to analyze the genetic and serology of acute symptomatic cases (early infection) during a hepatitis A outbreak and asymptomatic cases after the outbreak in two junior high schools in Surabaya in 2015 to 2016. Students with acute symptomatic hepatitis A during the outbreak and other students who were asymptomatic 3 to 4 months after the outbreak were enrolled. Asymptomatic students had no symptoms from the outbreak until they were enrolled. Sera were collected to identify anti-hepatitis A virus (HAV) IgM (by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) and HAV genetic variations/genotypes (using polymerase chain reaction [PCR]-sequencing and phylogenetic analysis). A total of 33 (97.1%) out of 34 sera of students with acute symptoms were positive for anti-HAV IgM and 18% of them were positive by PCR, identified as HAV subgenotype IA. No prominent amino acid variations were observed from reported HAV sequences from Indonesia. Among 38 sera of asymptomatic students, most (55.3%) were positive for anti-HAV IgM, while none were positive by PCR. In conclusion, HAV-IA was the only subgenotype identified in acute symptomatic cases during the outbreak. The percentage of HAV-specific IgM-positive cases was very high among acute symptomatic students, but that was also high among asymptomatic students, which might contribute as the important source of infection during the outbreak.",Functional rs6265 polymorphism in the brain-derived neurotrophic factor gene confers protection against neurocognitive dysfunction in posttraumatic stress disorder among Chinese patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659644,Journal of cellular biochemistry,2019 04 11,"Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a psychiatric disorder that plagues trauma survivors. Evidence shows that brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) may be involved in the occurrence and development of PTSD. Here we tried to demonstrate whether BDNF gene polymorphisms are correlated with neurocognitive function following PTSD in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study included 102 patients with HCC complicated with PTSD, 146 HCC patients, and 152 healthy volunteers. Initially, we evaluated the neurocognitive function of the study subjects. Next, we measured BDNF G11757C and rs6265 polymorphisms by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. The correlation of BDNF polymorphisms and BDNF level with HCC complicated with PTSD was evaluated. The results revealed that HCC complicated with PTSD showed decreased serum BDNF level and Mini-mental state examination (MMSE) score. Serum BDNF level of HCC and HCC complicated with PTSD was positively correlated with MMSE score. GA + AA allele and A allele of rs6265 increased the risk of PTSD among patients with HCC. GA and AA genotypes of rs6265 were correlated with the decreased MMSE score of HCC complicated with PTSD. Haplotype GA of rs6265 and G11757C increased the risk of PTSD for HCC, while haplotype CG decreased this risk. Lastly, the logistic regression analysis suggested that low BDNF level was a contributor to HCC complicated with PTSD, while GG genotype of rs6265 served as a protective factor. Collectively, this study defines the GG genotype of BDNF rs6265 polymorphism as a protector to HCC complicated with PTSD. In addition, these results provided a promising target for PTSD prevention in patients with HCC.",Dependence of the MR signal on the magnetic susceptibility of blood studied with models based on real microvascular networks.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659643,Magnetic resonance in medicine,2019 03 29,"The primary goal of this study was to estimate the value of

Quantitative reverse transcription PCR was performed to detect the relative expression of circ-PRKCI in five cases of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and five cases of paired adjacent normal tissues. RNA immunoprecipitation assay and Luciferase assay confirm the direct interaction between miR-3680-3p and AKT3 or circ-PRKCI. Ethynyldeoxyuridine assays and cell counting Kit-8 were performed to evaluate the effect of miR-3680-3p or circ-PRKCI on cell proliferation, transwell assays were also performed to detect migration in vitro. We found circ-PRKCI is obviously upregulated in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and upregulation of circ-PRKCI stimulated cell migration and proliferation of ESCC cells. In the mechanism, we confirm that circ-PRKCI, as a molecular sponge of miR-3680-3p, upregulates the expression of AKT. In conclusion, our current studies have been revealing that circ-PRKCI/miR-3680-3p/AKT3 regulatory network plays an important role in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and that provide new insights into the pathogenesis of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.","Research trends in equine movement analysis, future opportunities and potential barriers in the digital age: A scoping review from 1978 to 2018.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659639,Equine veterinary journal,2019 02 04,"Since Muybridge's 'horse in motion', researchers in the equine movement analysis field continue to improve objective analysis and performance monitoring while ensuring representative data capture.

A critical need faced by decisionmakers is to prioritize investment in security mitigations to maximally reduce risks in IT supply chains. We extend existing stochastic expected budgeted maximum multiple coverage models that identify ""good"" solutions on average that may be unacceptable in certain circumstances. We propose three alternative models that consider different robustness methods that hedge against worst-case risks, including models that maximize the worst-case coverage, minimize the worst-case regret, and maximize the average coverage in the

We illustrate the solutions to the robust methods with a case study and discuss the insights their solutions provide into mitigation selection compared to an expected-value maximizer. Our study provides valuable tools and insights for decisionmakers with different risk attitudes to manage cybersecurity risks under uncertainty."

The results from a plate assay indicated that Sx3 inhibited the growth of 20 strains of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo). Rice seedling experiments indicated that Sx3 promoted plant growth and suppressed bacterial leaf blight. In addition, bacteriological tests showed that Sx3 was able to fix nitrogen, solubilize phosphate and produce indole acetic acid, indicating that various mechanisms may be involved in the growth promotion by Sx3. The culture filtrate of P. polymyxa Sx3 reduced bacterial growth, biofilm formation and disrupted the cell morphology of Xoo strain GZ 0005, as indicated by the transmission and scanning electron microscopic observations. In addition, MALDI-TOF MS analysis revealed that Sx3 could biosynthesize two types of secondary metabolites fusaricidins and polymyxin P. In summary, this study clearly indicated that P. polymyxa Sx3 has strong in vitro and in vivo antagonistic activity against Xoo, which may be at least partially attributed to its production of secondary metabolites. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Antagonistic bacteria can grow well in their originating environment. However, it is unclear whether antagonistic bacteria were able to survive in different ecological environments. This study revealed that Paenibacillus polymyxa Sx3 isolated from rhizosphere soil of cotton significantly promoted the plant growth and suppressed bacterial leaf blight in rice. Therefore, it could be inferred that P. polymyxa Sx3 has the potential to be used as biocontrol agents in plants grown in different ecological environments.",Epigenetics in osteoarthritis: Novel spotlight.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659623,Journal of cellular physiology,2019 04 23,"Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common type of arthritis and no longer is considered as an absolute consequence of joint mechanical use (wear and tear); rather recent data demonstrate the pivotal role of inflammatory mediators in the development and progression of this disease. This multifactorial disease results from several environmental and inherited factors. Genetic cannot solely explain all the contribution share of inheritance and, this way, it is speculated that epigenetics can play a role, too. Moreover, environmental factors can induce local epigenetic changes. The epigenetic contribution to OA pathogenesis occurs at all of its levels, DNA methylation, histone modification, microRNA, and long noncoding RNA. In fact, during early phases of OA pathogenesis, environmental factors employ epigenetic mechanisms to provide a positive feedback for the OA-related pathogenic mechanisms and pathways with an ultimate outcome of a well-established clinical OA. These epigenetic changes stay during clinical disease and prevent the body natural healing and regenerative processes to work properly, resulting in an incurable disease condition. In this review article, we aimed to have an overview on the studies performed with regard to understanding the role of epigenetics in the etiopathogenesis of OA and highlighted the importance of such kind of regulatory mechanisms within this context.",Engaged Against the Machine: Institutional and Cultural Racial Discrimination and Racial Identity as Predictors of Activism Orientation among Black Youth.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659621,American journal of community psychology,2019 03 07,"The current study examines how experiences of institutional and cultural racial discrimination relate to orientations toward activism in the Black community among Black adolescents and emerging adults. Furthermore, we investigate the role of racial identity (centrality, public regard, nationalism) as moderators of those relations. In a national sample of 888 Black adolescents and emerging adults, we found that experiences of cultural racial discrimination, racial centrality, and nationalism ideology were related to a greater orientation toward low-risk Black community activism. For high-risk activism, nationalism was associated with a greater likelihood to participate in future social action in the Black community. The relation between experiences of institutional racial discrimination and high-risk activism orientation was moderated by public regard. For Black adolescents and emerging adults who believe others view Black people negatively, more experiences of institutional racial discrimination were related to a greater high-risk activism orientation. Findings highlight the importance of investigating racial discrimination as a multidimensional construct that extends beyond individual interactions and microaggressions. Furthermore, these findings underscore how phenomenological variation in experiences of racial discrimination and racial identity differentially influence adolescent and emerging adult orientations toward social action in and for the Black community.",Multiple infections caused by white spot syndrome virus and Enterocytozoon hepatopenaei in pond-reared Penaeus vannamei in India and multiplex PCR for their simultaneous detection.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659620,Journal of fish diseases,2019 04 01,"White leg shrimp, Penaeus vannamei, were collected on a monthly basis from grow-out ponds located at Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh states along the east coast of India for screening of viral and other pathogens. Totally 240 shrimp samples randomly collected from 92 farms were screened for white spot syndrome virus (WSSV), infectious hypodermal and haematopoietic necrosis virus (IHHNV), infectious myonecrosis virus (IMNV) and Enterocytozoon hepatopenaei (EHP). The number of shrimp collected from shrimp farms ranged from 6 to 20 based on the body weight of the shrimp. All the shrimp collected from one farm were pooled together for screening for pathogens by PCR assay. Among the samples screened, 28 samples were WSSV-positive, one positive for IHHNV and 30 samples positive for EHP. Among the positive samples, four samples were found to be positive for both WSSV and EHP, which indicated that the shrimp had multiple infections with WSSV and EHP. This is the first report on the occurrence of multiple infections caused by WSSV and EHP. Multiplex PCR (m-PCR) protocol was standardized to detect both pathogens simultaneously in single reaction instead of carrying out separate PCR for both pathogens. Using m-PCR assay, naturally infected shrimp samples collected from field showed two prominent bands of 615 and 510 bp for WSSV and EHP, respectively.",Comparative transcriptome analysis reveals the role of p53 signalling pathway during red-spotted grouper nervous necrosis virus infection in Lateolabrax japonicus brain cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659619,Journal of fish diseases,2019 05 02,"Nervous necrosis virus (NNV) is one of the fish pathogens that have caused mass mortalities of many marine and freshwater fishes in the world. To better comprehend the molecular immune mechanism of sea perch (Lateolabrax japonicus) against NNV infection, the comparative transcriptome analysis of red-spotted grouper nervous necrosis virus (RGNNV)-infected or mock-infected L. japonicus brain (LJB) cells was performed via RNA sequencing technology. Here, 1,969 up-regulated genes and 9,858 down-regulated genes, which were widely implicated in immune response pathways, were identified. Furthermore, we confirmed that p53 signalling pathway was repressed at 48 hr post-RGNNV infection, as indicated by up-regulation of Mdm2 and down-regulation of p53 and its downstream target genes, including Bax, Casp8 and CytC. Overexpression of L. japonicus p53 (Ljp53) significantly inhibited RGNNV replication and up-regulated the expression of apoptosis-related genes, whereas the down-regulation caused by pifithrin-α led to the opposite effect, suggesting Ljp53 might promote cell apoptosis to repress virus replication. Luciferase assay indicated that Ljp53 could enhance the promoter activities of zebrafish interferon (IFN)1, indicating that Ljp53 could exert its anti-RGNNV activities by enforcing the type I IFN response. This study revealed the potential antiviral role of p53 during NNV infection.",Piscine orthoreovirus-3 is prevalent in wild seatrout (Salmo trutta L.) in Norway.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659618,Journal of fish diseases,2019 04 01,"In 2017, a PCR-based survey for Piscine orthoreovirus-3 (PRV-3) was conducted in wild anadromous and non-anadromous salmonids in Norway. In seatrout (anadromous Salmo trutta L.), the virus was present in 16.6% of the fish and in 15 of 21 investigated rivers. Four of 221 (1.8%) Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) from three of 15 rivers were also PCR-positive, with Ct-values indicating low amounts of viral RNA. All anadromous Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus L.) were PCR-negative. Neither non-anadromous trout (brown trout) nor landlocked salmon were PRV-3 positive. Altogether, these findings suggest that in Norway PRV-3 is more prevalent in the marine environment. In contrast, PRV-3 is present in areas with intensive inland farming in continental Europe. PRV-3 genome sequences from Norwegian seatrout grouped together with sequences from rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss Walbaum) in Norway and Coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch Walbaum) in Chile. At present, the origin of the virus remains unknown. Nevertheless, the study highlights the value of safeguarding native fish by upholding natural and artificial barriers that hinder introduction and spread, on a local or national scale, of alien fish species and their pathogens. Accordingly, further investigations of freshwater reservoirs and interactions with farmed salmonids are warranted.","Albendazole, levamisole and ivermectin are effective against monogeneans of Colossoma macropomum (Pisces: Serrasalmidae).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659617,Journal of fish diseases,2019 04 01,"This study evaluated the efficacy of albendazole, ivermectin, levamisole, mebendazole and praziquantel on monogeneans of Colossoma macropomum, based on in vitro and in vivo assays. In vitro assays indicated that albendazole (500, 100, 1,500 and 2,000 mg/L), ivermectin (200, 250, 300 and 350 mg/L) and levamisole (50, 75, 100 and 125 mg/L) were 100% effective against Anacanthorus spatulatus, Notozothecium janauachensis, Mymarothecium boegeri and Linguadactyloides brinkmanni, while mebendazole (125, 150, 175 and 200 mg/L) and praziquantel (5, 10, 15 and 20 mg/L) were ineffective. Fish mortality in 24 hr therapeutic baths with 500 mg/L of albendazole was 6.6%, but the behaviour of the animals remained unchanged, while 200 mg/L of ivermectin caused lethargy, signs of hypoxia and 100% mortality within 2 hr, and 125 mg/L of levamisole caused no mortality. The efficacy of 500 mg/L of albendazole was 48.6% in the 24 hr baths, while that of 125 mg/L levamisole was 88.2%. Although ivermectin showed in vitro efficacy, the lowest concentration used in baths was highly toxic to fish. Therefore, we recommend the use of 125 mg/L of levamisole to control and treat monogenean infestations on C. macropomum in fish farming.","Two epizootic Perkinsus spp. events in commercial oyster farms at Santa Catarina, Brazil.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659615,Journal of fish diseases,2019 04 01,"Perkinsus spp. have been detected in various bivalve species from north-east Brazil. Santa Catarina is a South Brasil state with the highest national oyster production. Considering the pathogenicity of some Perkinsus spp., a study was carried out to survey perkinsosis in two oyster species cultured in this State, the mangrove oyster Crassostrea gasar and the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas. Sampling involved eight sites along the state coast, and oyster sampling was collected during the period between January 2013 and December 2014. For the detection of Perkinsus, Ray's fluid thioglycollate medium (RFTM) and histology were used, and for the identification of the species, PCR and DNA sequencing were used. Perkinsus spp. was found by RFTM in C. gigas and C. gasar from São Francisco do Sul. This pathology was also detected in C. gasar from Balneário Barra do Sul both, by RFTM and histology. Perkinsus marinus was identified in C. gigas and C. gasar from São Francisco do Sul and Perkinsus beihaiensis in C. gasar from Balneário Barra do Sul. This is the first report of P. marinus in C. gigas from South America. Results of this preliminary study suggest that both oyster species tolerate the species of Perkinsus identified, without suffering heavy lesions.",A metabolomic investigation into the temperature-dependent virulence of Pseudomonas plecoglossicida from large yellow croaker (Pseudosciaena crocea).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659613,Journal of fish diseases,2019 04 01,"Pseudomonas plecoglossicida is associated with multiple fish diseases, and temperature is one of the most important environmental factors related to its outbreak. To elucidate the influence of temperature variation on the pathogen, the global metabolomics of P. plecoglossicida (NZBD9) were analysed at the virulent (18°C) and avirulent (12°C and 28°C) temperatures. The result showed that the levels of Phosphoric acid, Tyrosine, Spermidine and Sucrose were significantly reduced，while Itaconic acid, Glucaric acid and Isomaltose were increased in P. plecoglossicida at 18°C. These metabolic adjustments assist P. plecoglossicida to survive in adverse environments, proliferate in the host, colonize and resist host immune clearance during the initial steps of infection. The results suggested that L321_03626 and L321_18122 genes played a key role in the regulation of these metabolic adaptions and thus regulated P. plecoglossicida virulence at virulent temperature, which was proved by further gene silencing and artificial infection. The present study, for the first time, determines the P. plecoglossicida metabolomic responses to temperature variation, which is helpful to explore its pathogenic mechanism and provides reference for disease control."

Chemostats are such systems, ensuring reproducibility and quality by providing a stable, well-controlled environment for the cells. However, many of the available chemostat systems require large amounts of media and are complex to set up and expensive to purchase and maintain. To address these concerns, we developed a mini-chemostat (MC) system with 16 reactors, each at a working volume of 40 ml. Sensors measure dissolved oxygen in the reactor, while OD600 is measured in the outflow. We further developed a CO2 and pH sensor array that can be plugged into the outflow of the reactors. The system was used to characterize yeast physiology at four metabolically different conditions: limitations of glucose, both aerobic and anaerobic, nitrogen, and ethanol. The physiology of yeast cells grown at the four different conditions in the MC system was compared with the yeast cells grown in a DASGIP 1 L system using RNAseq analysis. The results show that the MC system provides the same environmental conditions as the DASGIP system and that the MC system is reproducible between different runs. The system is built to be easily scalable with more reactors and to include more sensors, if available. Our study shows that a robust, reproducible chemostat system for high-throughput and large-scale experiments can be built at low costs.",Current achievements in the mechanically pretreated conversion of plant biomass.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659596,Biotechnology and bioengineering,2019 04 01,"At present, ""mechanochemistry"" is synonymous with ""grinding,"" according to the views of a significant number of scientists and technologists. Often, one comes across the opinion that ""the less the particle size, the better."" The cases of considering chemical reactions occurring during pretreatment, as well as considering changes in the ultrastructure of cell walls are extremely rare. Also, the wrong choice of the type of mechanical impact and the equipment used in most cases leads to excessive consumption of electrical energy and reduce economic efficiency. The review presents the currently available published data on mechanically activated processes for the pretreatment of plant materials and shows that when using mechanical treatment, it is necessary to look more closely at the phenomena occurring, rather than reducing everything to the production of fine and ultrafine powders. As a result of mechanical action, active surface radicals can form, hydrothermal chemical processes can occur, and mechanocomposites can form. The role of interphase processes, changes in surface chemistry, related dimensional effects, and the disordering of the crystal structure and amorphization should be taken into account. In addition, the physicochemical insights in mechanical pretreatment make it possible to more efficiently use the energy delivered to the material, and, consequently, increase the economic efficiency of the activation process.",Glucocorticoid receptor suppresses gene expression of Rev-erbα (Nr1d1) through interaction with the CLOCK complex.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659595,FEBS letters,2019 02 25,"Glucocorticoids have various medical uses but are accompanied by side effects. The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) has been reported to regulate the clock genes, but the underlying mechanisms are incompletely understood. In this study, we focused on the suppressive effect of the GR on the expression of Rev-erbα (Nr1d1), an important component of the clock regulatory circuits. Here we show that the GR suppresses Rev-erbα expression via the formation of a complex with CLOCK and BMAL1, which binds to the E-boxes in the Nr1d1 promoter. In this GR-CLOCK-BMAL1 complex, the GR does not directly bind to DNA, which is referred to as tethering. These findings provide new insights into the role of the GR in the control of circadian rhythm.","Adaptive functioning in children with neurofibromatosis type 1: relationship to cognition, behavior, and magnetic resonance imaging.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659594,Developmental medicine and child neurology,2019 03 16,To characterize the adaptive behavior profile of children with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and determine its relationship to neuropsychological functioning and non-neoplastic T2-weighted hyperintense brain lesions on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).,Decoupling of recombinant protein production from Escherichia coli cell growth enhances functional expression of plant Leloir glycosyltransferases.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659592,Biotechnology and bioengineering,2019 05 01,"Sugar nucleotide-dependent (Leloir) glycosyltransferases from plants are important catalysts for the glycosylation of small molecules and natural products. Limitations on their applicability for biocatalytic synthesis arise because of low protein expression (≤10 mg/L culture) in standard microbial hosts. Here, we showed two representative glycosyltransferases: sucrose synthase from soybean and UGT71A15 from apple. A synthetic biology-based strategy of decoupling the enzyme expression from the Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cell growth was effective in enhancing their individual (approximately fivefold) or combined (approximately twofold) production as correctly folded, biologically active proteins. The approach entails a synthetic host cell, which is able to shut down the production of host messenger RNA by inhibition of the E. coli RNA polymerase. Overexpression of the enzyme(s) of interest is induced by the orthogonal T7 RNA polymerase. Shutting down of the host RNA polymerase is achieved by l-arabinose-inducible expression of the T7 phage-derived Gp2 protein from a genome-integrated site. The glycosyltransferase genes are encoded on conventional pET-based expression plasmids that allow T7 RNA polymerase-driven inducible expression by isopropyl-β- d-galactoside. Laboratory batch and scaled-up (20 L) fed-batch bioreactor cultivations demonstrated improvements in an overall yield of active enzyme by up to 12-fold as a result of production under growth-decoupled conditions. In batch culture, sucrose synthase and UGT71A15 were obtained, respectively, at 115 and 2.30 U/g cell dry weight, corresponding to ∼5 and ∼1% of total intracellular protein. Fed-batch production gave sucrose synthase in a yield of 2,300 U/L of culture (830 mg protein/L). Analyzing the isolated glycosyltransferase, we showed that the improvement in the enzyme production was due to the enhancement of both yield (5.3-fold) and quality (2.3-fold) of the soluble sucrose synthase. Enzyme preparation from the decoupled production comprised an increased portion (61% compared with 26%) of the active sucrose synthase homotetramer. In summary, therefore, we showed that the expression in growth-arrested E. coli is promising for recombinant production of plant Leloir glycosyltransferases.",Evaluation of Socioeconomic Status Indicators for Confounding Adjustment in Observational Studies of Medication Use.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659590,Clinical pharmacology and therapeutics,2019 05 13,"Methodologic research evaluating confounding due to socioeconomic status (SES) in observational studies of medications is limited.

We created a propensity score (PS) containing only claims-based covariates and augmented it with additional claims-based proxies for SES, ZIP code, and block group level SES. Cox models with PS fine-stratification and weighting were used to compare rates of a cardiovascular end point and emergency department visits. Adjustment with only claims-based variables substantially improved balance on all SES variables compared with the unadjusted. Although inclusion of SES in PS models further improved balance on SES variables compared with models with claims-based covariates only, it did not materially change point estimates for either outcome.

Chinese hamster ovary fed-batch cell culture batches yielded consistent glycoprofiles of a Fc-fusion antibody comprizing three different N-glycosylation sites. By adding media supplements at specific concentrations in cell culture and applying enzymatic glycoengineering, a diverse N-glycan variant population was generated, including high mannose, afucosylated, fucosylated, agalactosylated, galactosylated, asialylated, and sialylated forms. Site-specific glycosylation profiles were elucidated by glycopeptide mapping and the effect of the glycosylation variants on the FcγRIIIa receptor binding affinity and the biological activity (cell-based and surface plasmon resonance) was assessed. The two fusion body glycosylation sites were characterized by a high degree of sialic acid, more complex N-glycan structures, a higher degree of antennarity, and a site-specific behavior in the presence of a media supplement. On the other hand, the media supplements affected the Fc-site glycosylation heterogeneity similarly to the various studies described in the literature with classical monoclonal antibodies. Enzymatic glycoengineering solely managed to generate high levels of galactosylation at the fusion body sites. Variants with low core fucosylation, and to a lower extent, high mannose glycans exhibited increased FcγRIIIa receptor binding affinity. All N-glycan variants exhibited weak effects on the biological activity of the fusion body. Both media supplementation and enzymatic glycoengineering are suitable to generate sufficient diversity to assess the effect of glycostructures on the biological activity.",Prenatal detection of esophageal atresia: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659586,Acta obstetricia et gynecologica Scandinavica,2019 05 15,"The primary aim of this systematic review was to quantify the diagnostic performance of ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging and amniotic fluid analysis in detecting esophageal atresia prenatally.

In this work, we implemented a human cardiac tissue-like in vitro model, derived from human-induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC), and evaluated the relevance of the cell-cell communication between the two of the most representative cell populations of the human heart: cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CM) and endothelial cells (hiPSC-EC). We observed that heterotypic cell communication promotes: (a) structural maturation of hiPSC-CM and (b) deposition of several extracellular matrix components (such as collagens and fibronectin). Overall, the toolbox of analytical techniques used in our study not only enabled us to validate previous reports from the literature on the importance of the presence of hiPSC-EC on hiPSC-CM maturation, but also bring new insights on the molecular mechanisms involved in the communication between these two cell types when cocultured in vitro."

The preferences may pertain to the properties of the object or the sexual activity itself. Diagnosing sexual preferences, in its basic form, is conducted with the use of disorder criteria defined in diagnostic classifications (ICD-10, DSM-5). However, while employing these criteria enables the categorization of the patient's sexual preferences as normal or pathological, they seem clearly insufficient for describing complex sexual interest patterns in a comprehensive manner. The goal of this article is to present a detailed dimensional model for describing sexual preferences. This proposal assumes the description of two aspects of preference: a contentual aspect, defining the individual hierarchy of sexually attractive and aversive stimuli, and a formal aspect. The latter involves four dimensions: the diversity of stimuli falling within the pattern of the patient's sexual interest, preference changeability in time, the coherence between individual components of responding to sexual stimuli, and insight into one's own preferences. The proposed model supplements the basic description of sexual preferences conducted on the basis of diagnostic criteria. The model can be a tool useful for diagnostic practice, particularly in precise characterization of various difficulties experienced by patients in relation to the properties of their sexual interests. It can also inspire new research on features of human sexual response patterns which have been neglected in previous analyses.",Gender dysphoria symptoms in schizophrenia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659566,Psychiatria polska,2019 05 08,"Gender dysphoria in individuals with schizophrenia may result from the delusionally changed gender identity or appear regardless of psychotic process. Distinguishing between these situations is not only a diagnostic challenge, but also affects the therapeutic decisionmaking. The review of the literature shows that different delusional beliefs regarding belonging to another gender, anatomy or changes within the genitals affect about one-fourth of patients with schizophrenia. Contemporary classifications of disorders are moving towards the elimination of psychotic disorders as a disqualifying criterion in diagnosing gender dysphoria. It is also established that schizophrenia may change the picture of gender dysphoria, e.g., by giving meaning and delusional interpretations of the fact of the incompatibility of phenotypic sex with the sense of gender. At the same time, before making a therapeutic decision (especially aimed at gender reassignment), it is necessary to exclude the psychotic background of the desire for gender reassignment. In case of co-occurrence of both disorders, it is crucial to evaluate the chronology and dynamics of the individual symptoms, their constancy (prolonged observation), patient's criticism and response to antipsychotic treatment.",Gender identity in schizophrenia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659565,Psychiatria polska,2019 05 08,"The aim of this paper is to present actual knowledge on how do people with schizophrenia experience themselves in the context of gender and how it affects their functioning. A review of the literature available in PubMed, PsycNET and Google Scholar was performed accordingly. Study of gender identity issues in schizophrenia should take into account both the personal and social dimensions of patients' functioning. The research on the core gender identity poses numerous difficulties and has not yet provided reliable conclusions. Some indications allow to assume higher than in the general population incidence of gender dysphoria among people with schizophrenia and a higher incidence of schizoid and schizotypal traits among people with gender dysphoria. Some patients experience positive symptoms regarding sex change. The data on the gender roles in schizophrenia patients show that they differ from the general population in terms of typically female and male characteristics. This may cause adaptive difficulties and negatively influence social interactions, especially in males who suffer from this illness. To sum up, published reports indicate specific difficulties in relation to gender identity among people with schizophrenia.",Can microbiology affect psychiatry?

The strongest evidence for the role of microbes in the gut-brain axis comes from animal studies. Nevertheless, the gutbrain crosstalk is a bidirectional communication system that not only provides gastrointestinal homeostasis, but can also affect motivation as well as higher cognitive functions. Moreover, gut microbiome can be associated with obesity and inflammatory gastrointestinal disorders.

This toxicities or side effects called immune-related adverse events (IRAEs) that can potentially affect any organ and tissue. Rheumatic diseases due to checkpoint inhibitors are also reported in the literature. The spectrum of rheumatic manifestations are quite wide; the most common are arthralgia/arthritis, myalgia/myositis, polimyalgia rheumatica, lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, Sjögren's syndrome. At the same time, these drugs can also cause an exacerbation of known rheumatologic disease. Treatment approaches for developing rheumatic findings due to checkpoint inhibitors should be multidisciplinary. There should be a close relationship between oncologists who follow-up these patients and rheumatologists. The rheumatic manifestations should be defined and treated early. In general, the musculoskeletal side effects are transient and may regress after stopping CPIs. The most commonly used medications are corticosteroids. Immunosuppressive drugs (hydroxychloroquine, methotrexate, anti-TNF-alpha, anti-IL-6) should also be preferred when treatment is unresponsive or as steroid-sparing agents.

New drugs and/or drug combinations need to be developed for safe and effective treatment. This compelling need stimulated efforts to explore drug repurposing for retinoblastoma. While conventional drug development is a lengthy and expensive process, drug repurposing is a faster, alternate approach, where an existing drug, not meant for treating cancer, can be repurposed to treat retinoblastoma. The present article reviews various attempts to test drugs approved for different purposes such as calcium channels blockers, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, cardenolides, antidiabetic, antibiotics and antimalarial for treating retinoblastoma.

The application of computer-aided drug designing (CADD) is an indispensable approach for developing safe and effective drugs. Previous methods based on combinatorial chemistry (CC) and high throughput screening (HTS) consumed a lot of time as well as expenditure. CADD based approaches including pharmacophore modeling (PM), molecular docking (MD), inverse docking, chemical similarity (CS), quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR), virtual screening (VS) and molecular dynamics simulations have been quite productive in predicting the therapeutic outcome of candidate drugs/compounds besides saving precious time. CADD tools exploit structural and other information available regarding the target (enzyme/receptor) and the ligands to identify the compounds with the ability to treat diseases notably cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, malaria, Ebola, HIV-AIDS and many more. Computational approaches have led to the discovery of many drugs that have passed preclinical and clinical trials and become novel therapeutics in the treatment of a variety of diseases. Some notable examples of CADD derived novel drugs include dorzolamide, saquinavir, ritonavir, indinavir, captopril and tirofiban. CADD plays important role in predicting absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity (ADME/T) of candidate drugs. Overall, CADD represents an effective and much-needed strategy for designing therapeutically effective drugs to combat human diseases.",Screening of Natural Lead Molecules Against Putative Molecular Targets of Drug-resistant Cryptococcus spp: An Insight from Computer-aided Molecular Design.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659541,Current topics in medicinal chemistry,2019 04 08,"Cryptococcosis is one of the major invasive fungal infections distributed worldwide with high mortality rate.

Anti-fungal resistances exhibited by the mentioned species of Cryptococcus threaten their effective prevention and treatment. There is limited information available on human to human transmission of the pathogen and virulent factors that are responsible for Cryptococcus mediated infections. Hence, there is high scope for understanding the mechanism, probable drug targets and scope of developing natural therapeutic agents that possess high relevance to pharmaceutical biotechnology and medicinal chemistry. The proposed review illustrates the role of computer-aided virtual screening for the screening of probable drug targets and identification of natural lead candidates as therapeutic remedies. The review initially focuses on the current perspectives on cryptococcosis, major metabolic pathways responsible for the pathogenesis, conventional therapies and associated drug resistance, challenges and scope of structure-based drug discovery. The review further illustrates various approaches for the prediction of unknown drug targets, molecular modeling works, screening of natural compounds by computational virtual screening with ideal drug likeliness and pharmacokinetic features, application of molecular docking studies and simulation.

The anti-apoptotic and pro-apoptotic members of Bcl-2 family are the most characterized proteins which are involved in the regulation of apoptotic cell death. The anti-apoptotic proteins such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL prevent apoptosis, whereas pro-apoptotic members like Bax and Bak, elicit the release of caspases from death antagonists inducing apoptosis. Thus, the Bcl-2 family of proteins play a vital role in controlling programmed cell death. Over expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins are often directly associated with various kinds of cancer. Developing suitable inhibitors for controlling the elevated levels of these proteins got much attention in last decade. Structural biology techniques such as Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, X-ray crystallography, homology modeling and molecular docking play a significant role in identifying the key inhibitors of these proteins. The authors have developed and tested successfully, several series of indole pharmacore containing inhibitors for Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL proteins based on the homology modeling, docking and suitable biochemical and apoptosis assays. This review provides a summary of potential inhibitor molecules developed for Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL proteins, as well as the the key residues of these proteins interacting with potential drug molecules. The present appraisal also focuses on the role of computational algorithms in developing potential drug molecules,with more emphasis on the role of homology modeling and docking studies in developing inhibitors for Bcl- 2, and Bcl-xL proteins in cancer therapy."

Nevertheless, several issues make the diagnosis of CKD in the elderly cumbersome. Among these are age related changes in structures and functions of the kidney, which may be difficult to distinguish from CKD, and multimorbidity. Thus, symptoms, clinical findings and laboratory abnormalities should be considered as potential clues to suspect CKD and to suggest screening. Comprehensive geriatric assessment is essential to define the clinical impact of CKD on functional status and to plan treatment. Correct patient referral is very important: patients with stage 4-5 CKD, as well as those with worsening proteinuria or progressive nephropathy (i.e. eGFR reduction > 5 ml/year) should be referred to nephrologist. Renal biopsy not unfrequently may be the key diagnostic exam and should not be denied simply on the basis of age.

Among the many different psycholinguistic variables whose impact on vWM has been studied, the lexical cohort effect is one of the few effects that has not yet been explored. The lexical cohort effect reflects the fact that words sharing their first phonemes with many other words (e.g. alcove, alligator, alcohol…) are typically responded to more slowly as compared to words sharing their first phonemes with a smaller number of words. In a pilot experiment (Experiment 1), we manipulated the lexical cohort effect in an immediate serial recall task and found no effect. Experiment 2 showed that, in a lexical decision task, participants responded more quickly to items stemming from small cohorts, showing that the material used in Experiment 1 allowed for a valid manipulation of the cohort effect. Experiment 3, using stimuli from Experiment 2 associated with maximal cohort effects during lexical decision, failed again to reveal a cohort effect in an immediate serial recall task.

A range of internal and external factors come into play when individuals engage in a task requiring cognitive control. Here we investigated whether increased working memory (WM) demands would induce a flexible change in cognitive control mode in young healthy individuals. We developed a novel variant of the well-known AX-continuous performance task (AX-CPT). We manipulated the cognitive demands of maintaining task-relevant contextual information and studied the impact of this manipulation on behavior and brain activity. We expected that low WM load would allow for a more effortful, proactive strategy, while high WM load would induce a strategy of less effortful, stimulus-driven reactive control. In line with our hypothesis, a web-based experiment revealed that increased load was associated with more reactive behavioral responses, and this finding was independently replicated in behavioral data acquired in the MRI scanner. The results from brain activity showed that the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex was activated by cues in the proactive mode and by probes in the reactive mode.

This study investigated dietary L. reuteri supplementation on the growth and health-including immune status-of piglets, as well as its colonization. A total of 60 sows with similar parity and body weight were allocated into one of three groups after secretion (n = 20 each, with 10 neonatal piglets of each): untreated control, L. reuteri supplementation, and antibiotic treatment. The experimental duration was 28 days, from birth of piglets to their group transferred. For the first 7 days after birth, all neonatal piglets were fed by sows. Piglets in the L. reuteri supplementation group were administered with 1.0 ml L. reuteri fermentation broth containing 5.0 × 107 CFU. From 7 to 28 days, piglets were given basal feed (control), basal feed supplemented with L. reuteri (1.0 × 107 CFU/g), or aureomycin (150 mg/kg). L. reuteri colonization in the distal jejunum and ileum was increased in piglets in the L. reuteri-supplemented as compared to the control group after 28 days, as determined by fluorescence in situ hybridization and real-time PCR analysis. Total Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium counts in the cecum were higher whereas total aerobic bacteria (Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus) counts were lower in the L. reuteri as compared to the control group. L. reuteri supplementation also improved body antioxidant status and immune function relative to control animals. Strain-specific L. reuteri administered to piglets colonizes the intestinal mucosa and improves cecal microbiota profile and whole-body antioxidant and immune status, leading to better growth and lower morbidity and mortality rates.",Correction to: Effects of Phenothiazines on Aldehyde Oxidase Activity Towards Aldehydes and N-Heterocycles: an In Vitro and In Silico Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659501,European journal of drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics,2019 05 20,"Unfortunately, the original article was published with error in author names.

Ingestion of ~ 20 g of quickly digestible protein isolate optimizes muscle protein synthesis rates during the first few hours of post-exercise recovery. However, the majority of daily protein intake is consumed as slower digestible, nutrient-rich, whole-food protein sources as part of mixed meals. Therefore, the muscle protein synthetic response to the ingestion of protein supplements and typical foods or mixed meals may differ substantially. In addition, the muscle protein synthetic response to feeding is not only determined by acute nutrient intake but is also likely modulated by habitual energy and nutrient intake and nondietary factors such as habitual physical activity, body composition, age, and/or sex. Therefore, nutritional recommendations to maximize the muscle protein synthetic response to exercise depend on the type of meal (e.g., protein supplements vs. mixed meals) and the time until the next feeding opportunity (e.g., feeding before overnight sleep) and, therefore, need to be personalized to the individual athlete.",Learned Helplessness After Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction: An Altered Neurocognitive State?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659498,"Sports medicine (Auckland, N.Z.)",2019 04 15,"Traumatic knee injuries, such as anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) sprains, have detrimental effects on long-term health as they initiate a cycle of chronic pain, physical inactivity, and disability.

HR reduction is known as an important treatment and therapy strategy for patients with mitral valve stenosis. Aim of the review The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to compare the efficacy of ivabradine versus beta-blockers in patients with mitral stenosis in sinus rhythm. Methods Randomized controlled trials were searched in Cochrane Library, PubMed, Web of Science, CRD, Scopus, and Google Scholar with no start time limitation and ending June 2018. Risk of bias across was assessed by the Cochrane Risk of Bias Assessment tool. Fixed effects models were used to combine the results and the mean difference with a 95% confidence interval. This meta-analysis was performed using Meta Package in R software. Results Five studies entered meta-analysis. The total number of patients treated with ivabradine and beta-blockers was 178 and 178 respectively. The results showed that the mean of maximum HR and HR at rest was lower at about 5.03 units and upper 4.32 units respectively with use of ivabradine compared with the use of beta-blockers. These values were statistically significant.

Deprescribing is a proposed intervention that can help to minimise polypharmacy whilst potentially improving several health outcomes in older people. Objective This study aimed to examine the feasibility of implementing a deprescribing intervention that utilises a patient-centred pharmacist-led intervention model; in order to address major deprescribing challenges such as general practitioner time constraints and lack of accessible deprescribing guidelines and processes. Setting Three residential care facilities. Methods The intervention involved a New Zealand registered pharmacist utilising peer-reviewed deprescribing guidelines to recommend targeted deprescribing of anticholinergic and sedative medicines to GPs. Main outcome measure The change in the participants' Drug Burden Index (DBI) total and DBI 'as required' (PRN) was assessed 3 and 6 months after implementing the deprescribing intervention. Results Seventy percent of potential participants were recruited for the study (n = 46), and 72% of deprescribing recommendations suggested by the pharmacist were implemented by General Pratitioners (p = 0.01; Fisher's exact test). Ninety-six percent of the residents agreed to the deprescribing recommendations, emphasising the importance of patient centred approach. Deprescribing resulted in a significant reduction in participants' DBI scores by 0.34, number of falls and adverse drug reactions, 6 months post deprescribing. Moreover, participants reported lower depression scores and scored lower frailty scores 6 months after deprescribing. However, cognition did not improve; nor did participants' reported quality of life. Conclusion This patient-centred deprescribing approach, demonstrated a high uptake of deprescribing recommendations and success rate. After 6 months, significant benefits were noted across a range of important health measures including mood, frailty, falls and reduced adverse reactions. This further supports deprescribing as a possible imperative to improve health outcomes in older adults."

The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between the administration of peri-operative transfusions due to the anemia or the clinical status and the post-operative clinical outcomes. 188 patients diagnosed with of gastric cancer were recruited at Surgery 2 of the Department of General and Specialist Surgery of the Tertiary Care Hospital ""A. Cardarelli"" of Naples. All patients had a total or a subtotal gastrectomy accompanied by D2 lymphectomy for gastric cancer. The clinical data most frequently associated with blood transfusion is the appearance of a post-operative infection (OR 2.26, 95% CI 0.87-5.79, P = 0.061). If the administration time of transfusion is considered, the clinical outcomes are different: preoperative transfusions showed a higher incidence of infections (OR 2.26, 95% CI 0.87-5.79, P = 0.061) and acute renal failure (OR 2.82, 95% CI 0.70-10.78, P = 0.078); patients who received intra or post-operative transfusions showed a prolonged hospitalization (OR 8.66, 95% CI 1.73-83.00, P = 0.002). The administration of blood products in the perioperative period is correlated in a statistically significant manner to the incidence of infections, acute renal failure and prolonged hospitalization; therefore, transfusions should be avoided unless clinically necessary and in particular intraoperative transfusions should be avoided because the immunomodulation effect linked to surgical stress may be enhanced hence worsening the prognosis.",Social Networks of Substance-Using Populations: Key Issues and Promising New Approaches for HIV.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659477,Current HIV/AIDS reports,2019 03 29,"This paper presents recent literature on substance using networks and HIV, highlighting renewed and emerging themes in the field.

Animal,2019 05 27,"Recent studies have successfully generated tooth-like structure by mimicking the reciprocal interaction between dental epithelial and mesenchymal cells in tooth organogenesis. However, clinical applications of these methods are limited primarily due to the lack of appropriate sources for dental epithelial cells. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are attractive as a source for dental epithelial cells due to their unique characteristics. In this study, we examined the effect of neurotrophin-4 (NT-4) on the differentiation of mouse iPSCs (miPSCs) into dental epithelial cells. Our results showed that the addition of NT-4 during the formation of embryoid body significantly triggered the upregulation of epithelial markers such as p63 and CK14, suggesting that NT-4 provides an inductive condition for the differentiation of miPSCs into epithelial cells. Expansion of the NT-4-treated cells under serum-free culture conditions improves the formation of cells with cobblestone-like morphology and significantly downregulated the expression of pluripotent and ectodermal markers. Phenotypic analysis revealed that a dental epithelial surface marker, CD49f, was highly expressed on these cells. Formation of miPSCs-derived dental epithelial-like cells was further confirmed by the expression of ameloblast-specific markers. These results suggest that the addition of NT-4 during the formation of embryoid body together with the serum-free culture condition promoted the differentiation of miPSCs into dental epithelial-like cells.",A Potential Role for the STXBP5-AS1 Gene in Adult ADHD Symptoms.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659475,Behavior genetics,2019 05 03,"We aimed to detect Attention-deficit/hyperactivity (ADHD) risk-conferring genes in adults. In children, ADHD is characterized by age-inappropriate levels of inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity and may persists into adulthood. Childhood and adulthood ADHD are heritable, and are thought to represent the clinical extreme of a continuous distribution of ADHD symptoms in the general population. We aimed to leverage the power of studies of quantitative ADHD symptoms in adults who were genotyped. Within the SAGA (Study of ADHD trait genetics in adults) consortium, we estimated the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based heritability of quantitative self-reported ADHD symptoms and carried out a genome-wide association meta-analysis in nine adult population-based and case-only cohorts of adults. A total of n = 14,689 individuals were included. In two of the SAGA cohorts we found a significant SNP-based heritability for self-rated ADHD symptom scores of respectively 15% (n = 3656) and 30% (n = 1841). The top hit of the genome-wide meta-analysis (SNP rs12661753; p-value = 3.02 × 10-7) was present in the long non-coding RNA gene STXBP5-AS1. This association was also observed in a meta-analysis of childhood ADHD symptom scores in eight population-based pediatric cohorts from the Early Genetics and Lifecourse Epidemiology (EAGLE) ADHD consortium (n = 14,776). Genome-wide meta-analysis of the SAGA and EAGLE data (n = 29,465) increased the strength of the association with the SNP rs12661753. In human HEK293 cells, expression of STXBP5-AS1 enhanced the expression of a reporter construct of STXBP5, a gene known to be involved in ""SNAP"" (Soluble NSF attachment protein) Receptor"" (SNARE) complex formation. In mouse strains featuring different levels of impulsivity, transcript levels in the prefrontal cortex of the mouse ortholog Gm28905 strongly correlated negatively with motor impulsivity as measured in the five choice serial reaction time task (r2 = - 0.61; p = 0.004). Our results are consistent with an effect of the STXBP5-AS1 gene on ADHD symptom scores distribution and point to a possible biological mechanism, other than antisense RNA inhibition, involved in ADHD-related impulsivity levels.",Etiological Distinction Across Dimensions of Math Anxiety.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659474,Behavior genetics,2019 05 03,"Analyses have suggested math anxiety is a multidimensional construct. However, previous behavioral genetic work examining math anxiety was unidimensional. Thus, the purpose of the present study was to examine different approaches for specifying behavioral genetic models of math anxiety as a multidimensional construct. Three models were compared: a unidimensional model, a three dimension multidimensional model, and a bi-factor model, which partitioned variance into one common factor shared across three dimensions of math anxiety and examined residual variance in each dimension. The best fitting model was a bi-factor AE model, which suggested moderate heritability of general math anxiety and that each dimension of math anxiety had unique etiological influences not accounted for by shared variance with the general math anxiety factor. Thus, while there was evidence of shared etiology, there was also evidence of some etiological distinction across dimensions of math anxiety. The results demonstrate the importance of taking into account the dimensionality of the scale when interpreting similarity across twins.","In vivo detection of oral precancer using a fluorescence-based, in-house-fabricated device: a Mahalanobis distance-based classification.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659473,Lasers in medical science,2019 01 19,"In vivo detection of oral precancer has been carried out by a fluorescence-based, in-house-developed handheld probe on three groups: oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), dysplastic (precancer), and control (normal). Measurements have been performed on a total of 141 patients and volunteers of different age groups. Excitation wavelength of 405 nm was used and fluorescence emission spectra were recorded in the scan range of 450.14 to 763.41 nm at very low incident power (122 μW) from different oral sites buccal mucosa (BM), lateral boarder of tongue (LBT), and dorsal surface of tongue (DST). Spectral profiles are found to vary among the three groups as well as among the different oral sites. Major and minor bands of flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) and porphyrins near 500, 634, 676, 689, and 703 nm have been obtained. Porphyrin contribution is found to be more dominant than the FAD in OSCC and dysplastic groups as compared to the control group. A better classification has been observed using the entire spectral range rather than restricting to individual bands, by application of principal component analysis (PCA), Mahalanobis distance model, and receiver operating characteristic analysis (ROC). ROC on Mahalanobis distance differentiates OSCC to normal, dysplastic to normal, and OSCC to dysplastic with sensitivities from 71% to 98%, 92% to 94% and 81% to 93% and specificities 91% to 100%, 86% to 100% and 79% to 97% for oral sites BM, LBT and DST.

An experimental study was conducted at the Balderas Sport Horses and Recreational Center, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, from January to June, 2018, to evaluate conception rate to frozen semen in local and exotic crossbreed mares. Mares were teased to characterize estrus behavior and examined by ultrasound in determining imminent ovulation. Inseminations were done post ovulation within an average of 6-9 h using frozen-thawed semen. The overall conception rate to frozen semen was 15/21 (71.43%) with 8/11 (72.73%) in crossbreed and 7/10 (70%) in local breed mares. Age and body condition score (BCS) of animals had no significant effect on conception rate to AI with frozen semen. A slightly higher conception rate was obtained when ovulation was from the right ovary than when ovulated from the left ovary. A higher conception rate was obtained when the diameter of the preovulatory follicle was ≤ 45 mm than above diameter. The conception rate increased significantly with increased number of services/conception with an overall mean ± (SEM) of 2.2 ± 0.2 services/conception. A more number of services/conception were required for local breed (2.7 ± 0.2) than crossbreed mares (1.8 ± 0.3) and again for lower body condition scores than higher condition scores of mares. In conclusion, the increased number of services improved the conception rate with significant difference between breed of mares, whereas good management of mares for improved body conditions could be required to decrease the number of services per conception.","Effect of dietary inclusion of small quantities of Mucuna pruriens seed meal on sexual behavior, semen characteristics, and biochemical parameters in rabbit bucks (Oryctolagus cuniculus).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659457,Tropical animal health and production,2019 05 20,"The aim of this work was to investigate the effects of Mucuna pruriens seed meal (MSM) on sexual behavior, semen, and biochemical parameters in rabbit bucks. Twenty-four 12-week-old rabbit bucks weighing 1002 to 1156 g were randomly allocated to three experimental diets containing 0, 1.5, and 3% of MSM in a 3-month trial. Sexual behavior parameters such as mounting latency, mounting frequency, successful mounting frequency, intromission latency, and post ejaculatory interval were monitored at the end of the experiment by mating with receptive females. Thereafter, rabbits were weighed, stunned, and humanely sacrificed and testes, epididymis, and vas deferens were harvested for evaluation of organ weights and semen characteristics. Results indicate that supplementing rabbit diet with MSM induced a significant decrease (P < 0.05) in mounting latency (69.7%) and intromission latency (19.7%), while it significantly (P < 0.05) increased successful mounting frequency (60%) as well as relative weight of testis (33.3%) and vas deferens (54.5%). There was a dose-dependent increase (P < 0.05) in sperm motility (35.7%) and concentration (65.9%), serum albumin (19.1%) and protein concentration (9.9%), and a decrease in sperm morphological alterations (68.3%), serum cholesterol (13.4%), and urea (11.6%) in treatment groups where MSM was supplemented at 3% compared to controls.

In addition, we aimed to provide new directions for the improvement of therapeutic measures and the development of drugs. Although Western medicine can significantly contribute to the treatment of gout, Chinese herbal medicine has unique advantages, including reduced adverse reactions and higher patient compliance. It may also fill in the shortcomings of Western medicine in the intermittent period treatment of gout. In addition to constantly exploring pathogenesis and drug targets, research on Chinese herbal medicine is equally important.

However, the pathogenesis is still unknown and several hypotheses have been made about possible triggering factors, including hormones, neurogenic inflammation, smoking, UV filters, and ingredients in leave-on facial products. A genetic basis has also been hypothesized as the disease can occur in siblings and members of the same family. Besides its pathogenesis, research is also focused on treatment; FFA is a chronic condition and at present there is no validated or approved treatment for this disorder. Commonly prescribed topical treatments include corticosteroids, minoxidil, and calcineurin inhibitors. Systemic treatments include 5α-reductase inhibitors, hydroxychloroquine, and retinoids. Intralesional triamcinolone acetonide is also utilized, especially for the eyebrows. Other possible treatments include pioglitazone, naltrexone, tofacitinib, and lasers.",Sensation Seeking and Impulsivity Can Increase Exposure to Risky Media and Moderate Its Effects on Adolescent Risk Behaviors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659453,Prevention science : the official journal of the Society for Prevention Research,2019 06 15,"Media exposure to risky behaviors (e.g., alcohol use, violence) has been associated with adolescent engagement in risk-taking behaviors, but not all adolescents are equally at risk. Here we focus on individual differences in impulsivity and sensation seeking and assess their effects on the relation between media risk exposure and adolescent risk behavior. Survey data from 1990 Black and White US adolescents (mean age = 15.6 ± 1.10 years; 48% female) and content analysis of top-grossing films and popular TV shows were analyzed using linear regression models. High levels of impulsivity and sensation seeking were associated with greater exposure to risky media content, and also operated as moderators, exacerbating the impact of media risk exposure on adolescent risk behaviors. Prevention efforts targeting negative effects of media on adolescent health should prioritize youth with high levels of impulsivity and sensation seeking.","DNA cleavage, DNA/HSA binding study, and antiproliferative activity of a phenolate-bridged binuclear copper(II) complex.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659452,"Biometals : an international journal on the role of metal ions in biology, biochemistry, and medicine",2019 04 11,"A novel phenolate-bridged binuclear copper(II) complex, [Cu 2II (L-3H)Cl] (1, where L = 2,6-bis[((2-hydroxybenzyl)(2-pyridylmethyl)amino)methyl]-4-methylphenol), have been synthesized and characterized. The antiproliferative activity of the complex has been tested in vitro against the human cervical cancer cell line HeLa, human non-small-cell lung cancer cell line A-549, the human breast cancer cell line MCF-7, and the human hepatic cell line LO2. The results show the complex has the low micromolar range (9.4-11.2 µM) of IC50 values towards the three cancer cell lines, which is markedly comparable to those of cisplatin. However 1 exhibited 10.6-fold less toxicity than cisplatin toward normal cells LO2, suggesting that complex 1 had high selectivity between tumor cells and normal cells. The interactions with DNA were investigated by UV-Vis absorption, fluorescence, circular dichroism, and gel electrophoresis. The results show that the copper(II) complex could strongly bind to DNA mainly by the groove binding mode and efficiently cleave the pBR322 plasmid DNA into its nicked and linear forms in the presence of excessive ascorbic acid. In addition, the evaluation of the protein binding ability shows that complex 1 could bind to human serum albumin (HSA) with a moderate binding affinity and quench the intrinsic fluorescence of HSA.",Biodegradable magnesium alloys as temporary orthopaedic implants: a review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659451,"Biometals : an international journal on the role of metal ions in biology, biochemistry, and medicine",2019 04 11,"The study of innovative biodegradable implant materials is one of the most interesting research topics at the forefront in the area of biomaterials. Biodegradable implant materials in the human body can be gradually dissolved, absorbed, consumed or excreted, so there is no need for the secondary surgery to remove implants after the surgery regions have healed. However, most of the biodegradable materials, usually polymers, do not have good mechanical properties to be reliable for bearing the load of the body. Magnesium and its alloys due to the excellent biodegradability and biocompatibility as well as the suitable mechanical compatibility with human bone are very promising candidates for the development of temporary, degradable implants in load-bearing applications. However, Mg alloys are corrosion susceptible in a biological environment. Besides, the high corrosion rate and the low bioactivity of magnesium implants are the challenging problems, which need to be resolved before employing them in clinical applications. This paper provides a review of state-of-the-art of magnesium alloy implants for orthopedic and tissue engineering applications and describes recent progress in the design of novel structure design Mg alloys and potential approaches to improve their biodegradation performance.",Modeling strategies to improve parameter estimates in prognostic factors analyses with patient-reported outcomes in oncology.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659449,"Quality of life research : an international journal of quality of life aspects of treatment, care and rehabilitation",2019 06 05,The inclusion of patient-reported outcome (PRO) questionnaires in prognostic factor analyses in oncology has substantially increased in recent years.

Thirteen CEA for carotid diameter stenosis > 70% were performed with patch graft (PG) angioplasty in nine cases, and primary closure (PC) in four cases. MRI acquisitions within one month after CEA were used for hemodynamic and geometric characterization. Personalized computational hemodynamic simulations quantified the exposure to low and oscillatory wall shear stress (WSS). Geometry was characterized in terms of flare (the expansion at the bulb) and tortuosity. At 60 months after CEA, Doppler ultrasound (DUS) was applied for restenosis detection and intima-media thickness determination. Larger flares were associated to larger exposure to low WSS (Pearson R2 values up to 0.38, P < 0.05). The two cases characterized by the highest flare and the largest low WSS exposure developed restenosis > 50% at 60 months. Linear regressions revealed associations of DUS observations of thickening with flare variables (up to R2 = 0.84, P < 0.001), and the exposure to low (but not oscillatory) WSS (R2 = 0.58, P < 0.05). Our findings suggest that arteriotomy repair should avoid a large widening of the carotid bulb, which is linked to restenosis via the generation of flow disturbances. Hemodynamics and geometry-based analyses hold potential for (1) preoperative planning, guiding the PG vs. PC clinical decision, and (2) stratifying long-term restenosis risk after CEA.",Re-testing of predictive biomarkers on surgical breast cancer specimens is clinically relevant.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659433,Breast cancer research and treatment,2019 04 16,The accuracy of predictive and prognostic biomarker assessment in breast cancer is paramount since these guide therapy decisions.

The study examined whether basal heart rate and heart rate reactivity were related to recovery in anxiety following stress, and conversely, whether initial self-reported anxiety and anxiety reactivity were related to heart rate recovery. Fifty-six smokers completed a 10-min baseline period, a 4-min stressor, and a 10-min recovery period during which heart rate and anxiety were continuously assessed. Results indicated significant linear (p < .01, d = 0.31) and quadratic (p = .02, d = 0.27) effects of baseline heart rate and reactivity (linear p < .01, d = 0.80; quadratic p < .01, d = 0.66) on recovery in anxiety and significant linear (p < .01, d = 0.88) and quadratic (p < .01, d = 0.74) effects of anxiety reactivity on heart rate recovery. These findings suggest that reduced reactivity in both heart rate and anxiety predicted slower recovery in the opposite domain. Findings offer initial evidence for psychophysiological integration in cigarette smokers.",Prescriber Implementation of STOPP/START Recommendations for Hospitalised Older Adults: A Comparison of a Pharmacist Approach and a Physician Approach.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659429,Drugs & aging,2019 04 23,Two randomised controlled trials (RCTs) conducted simultaneously in the same Irish university teaching hospital have shown that provision of Screening Tool of Older Persons' Prescriptions (STOPP)/Screening Tool to Alert doctors to Right Treatment (START) recommendations to attending prescribers by a physician or a pharmacist can reduce in-hospital adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in older adults (≥ 65 years).

Although some articles have explored how residents engage with supervisors, nurses and pharmacists individually, there is little research on how residents enter into and engage with the broader community of clinical practice (CoCP). To this end, we designed a constructivist grounded theory study that took place at Universidad Javeriana in Bogotá, Colombia. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 13 residents from different training levels and disciplines during the first weeks of their new rotations. During the interviews, we used the Pictor technique as a visual aid to collect data. Using iterative data collection and analysis, constant comparison methods and theoretical sampling, we constructed the final results. When entering a CoCP, residents experienced recurring and intertwined processes including: exploring how their goals and interest are aligned with those of the CoCP; identifying the relevant CoCP members in the workplace environment; and understanding how these members could assist their successful engagement with the community's practices. Residents entered a CoCP with the intention of either having a central or a peripheral trajectory in it. The final resident participation and role resulted from negotiations between the resident and the CoCP members. Optimising workplace learning includes being mindful as to how each member of the healthcare team influence residents' engagement on practice, and on understanding the nuances of residents' participatory trajectories while interacting with them. Understanding such nuances could be key to align CoCPs' learning affordances and residents' goals and intentions.",Correlates of Fatigue Among South African Adolescents Living with HIV and Receiving Antiretroviral Therapy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659425,AIDS and behavior,2019 04 09,"Fatigue among adolescents living with HIV is poorly understood. In this study, we examined the relationships between fatigue and demographic and psychosocial variables to further the understanding of the symptom experience and associated factors. We recruited consecutive attenders at ART clinics in the Western Cape, South Africa (N = 134, age 11-18 years). Participants completed a battery of questionnaires including measures of fatigue, insomnia and mood disturbance. Just under a quarter (24.6%) of adolescents reported elevated levels of fatigue that affected their functioning. The linear combination of age, depression, and insomnia explained 40.6% of the variance in fatigue. Amongst adolescents with HIV, fatigue seems a problematic symptom associated with poor sleep and mood disturbance. Timely identification and management of these potentially disabling symptoms are needed to attain better health outcomes and retention in care in this group. Interventions aimed at ameliorating these symptoms are needed."

We studied the outcome of CHF outpatient management in reducing hospitalization after discharge from a division of Internal Medicine at a large 3rd referral regional Hospital. 147 CHF inpatients (M:F: 63:84; mean age 76 ± 9.6 years) admitted for acute exacerbation of CHF were followed up as outpatients at 1, 6, 12 and 24 months after discharge. At baseline, patients underwent: laboratory tests, ECG, echocardiogram and a dedicated-intensive health care educational program involving also their families. The rate of hospitalization in the same group of patients was compared with data from the previous 24 months, a period when patients had been seen elsewhere without disease management programs. Patients had high prevalence of comorbidities and the majority was in NYHA class III or IV. Hypertension and valvular heart disease were the most common causes for CHF. Systolic function was preserved (LVEF ≥ 50%) in 61.9% of cases. Functional NYHA class improved significantly after 6 months and remained stable at 24 months. There was a significant increase in the use of the renin-angiotensin system blockers, beta-blockers and diuretics compared to admission to the ward. At 24 months, hospital readmissions were decreased by 42% as compared to the previous 24 months. Risk factors for re-hospitalizations were anemia, NYHA class III or IV and previous hospitalizations. Establishing an intensive outpatient management program for CHF patients leads to long-term beneficial effects with improved clinical parameters and decreased hospitalization in the setting of Internal Medicine.","Income, Race and its Association with Obesogenic Behaviors of U.S. Children and Adolescents, NHANES 2003-2006.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659412,Journal of community health,2019 05 10,To describe the associations of income and race with obesogenic behaviors and % body fat among a large sample of U.S. children and adolescents.,Level of agreement of point-of-care and laboratory HbA1c measurements in the preoperative outpatient clinic in non-diabetic patients who are overweight or obese.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659411,Journal of clinical monitoring and computing,2019 01 19,"Implementation of point-of-care HbA1c devices in the preoperative outpatient clinic might facilitate the early diagnosis of glycemic disturbances in overweight or obese patients undergoing surgery, but validation studies in this setting do not exist.

Point-of-care HbA1c levels were measured in whole blood obtained by a finger prick (Siemens DCA Vantage HbA1c analyzer) and in hemolysed EDTA blood in the central laboratory (LAB). Bland Altman and Clarke's error grid analysis were used to analyze the agreement between the point-of-care and laboratory measurements. Patients (n = 49) were 55 ± 11 years old, 47% were male with a body mass index (BMI) of 30.6 ± 3.4 kg/m2. The mean HbA1c was 38.1 ± 3.7 mmol/mol or 5.6 ± 0.3%.

This malignancy is associated with poor prognosis and high mortality. Novel approaches for prolonging the overall survival of patients with advanced HCC are urgently needed. The antitumor activities of adoptive cell transfer therapy (ACT), such as strategies based on tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and cytokine-induced killer cells, are more effective than those of traditional strategies. Currently, chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) immunotherapy has achieved numerous breakthroughs in the treatment of hematological malignancies, including relapsed or refractory lymphoblastic leukemia and refractory large B-cell lymphoma. Nevertheless, this approach only provides a modest benefit in the treatment of solid tumors. The clinical results of CAR-T immunotherapy for HCC that could be obtained at present are limited. Some published studies have demonstrated that CAR-T could inhibit tumor growth and cause severe side effects. In this review, we summarized the current application of ACT, the challenges encountered by CAR-T technology in HCC treatment, and some possible strategies for the future direction of immunotherapeutic research.",Patterns in anticoagulant utilization in the Czech Republic during 2007-2017.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659407,Journal of thrombosis and thrombolysis,2019 02 28,"Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have gradually entered the Czech market as alternatives to vitamin K antagonists and parenteral anticoagulants since 2008. Considering the eventual changes, the aim was to evaluate drug use and expenditure patterns on anticoagulants in the Czech Republic. A retrospective utilization study was conducted retrieving data from the State Institute for Drug Control database, including reports on drug supplies from distributors with anatomical therapeutic chemical classification (ATC) codes B01AA, B01AB, B01AE, B01AF, and B01AX. The utilization on national level was expressed as the ratio of the number of defined daily doses per 1000 inhabitants per day (DDD/TID). Expenditures on all anticoagulants were also assessed. Data was analyzed using PASW (version 18.0). Between January 2007 and December 2017, the national anticoagulant utilization rate increased continuously from 14.15 to 27.67 DDD/TID. The use of DOACs was 0.002 DDD/TID in 2008, increased to 6.04 DDD/TID in 2017. Warfarin utilization, after a small decrease in 2008, has shown nearly stable levels in the recent years (70.9% of all anticoagulants; mean 11.55 DDD/TID over the last 5 years), while its increase was halted by the spread of DOACs utilization (p < 0.05). In 2017, over half of the expenditures (51.1%) were due to oral anticoagulants, whereof 47.6% was related to DOACs. The results reflected a growing utilization and increasing costs of all anticoagulants, especially in DOACs at the expense of warfarin. Still, additional information regarding patient persistence and prescribing patterns is needed for a better understanding of oral anticoagulant utilization.",The Role of Socio-demographics in Adoption of Religious-Spiritual and Other Coping Strategies Among Muslim Chronic Patients with Hepatitis C in Pakistan.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659406,Journal of religion and health,2019 01 19,"Coping has emerged as a vital indicator among patients in the chronic conditions. The current study examined the role of demographic characteristics (such as age, education, gender, marital status, residential background, family type and number of children) in adoption of coping (emotion-focused, problem-solving, religious-spiritual) strategies for nursing among hepatitis patients. A sample of 500 patients (of hepatitis C) was drawn from five most populous districts (Lahore, Faisalabad, Rawalpindi, Gujranwala and Multan) of Punjab, Pakistan, by using Epi Info software with an alpha level of 0.03. The data were collected using a well-structured multi-sectional interview schedule through multistage proportionate sampling technique. Descriptive analysis, regression analysis and reliability analysis were computed using SPSS (version 21.0). In the overall adoption of coping strategies, lower monthly household income, lower education, rural residences, nuclear family setting and married status were contributing to the adoption of higher coping strategies among Muslim chronic patients with hepatitis C. The results of socio-demographics are also discussed with other coping strategies (such as religious-spiritual coping strategies, problem-solving coping strategies, emotion-focused coping strategies and constructive coping strategies). It was the first quantitative study of adoption of coping strategies among Muslim hepatitis patients in Pakistan. The study highlighted the importance of socio-demographic resources to cope with chronic illness. The empirical findings would start a new discussion from hepatic, counseling and nursing perspective. For terminal patients, these socio-demographic characteristics can serve as a guideline to provide community sources of social support. Medical social workers and healthcare experts need to facilitate the efforts of patients to cope with chronic illness through revision of nursing policy according to the socio-demographic and spiritual-religious needs of the patients.",Reconciling Adaptation and Fidelity: Implications for Scaling Up High Quality Youth Programs.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659405,The journal of primary prevention,2019 02 19,"In the field of prevention science, some consider fidelity to manualized protocols to be a hallmark of successful implementation. A growing number of scholars agree that high-quality implementation should also include some adaptations to local context, particularly as prevention programs are scaled up, in order to strengthen their relevance and increase participant engagement. From this perspective, fidelity and adaptation can both be seen as necessary, albeit mutually exclusive, dimensions of implementation quality. In this article, we propose that the relationship between these two constructs may be more complex, particularly when adaptations are consistent with the key principles underlying the program model. Our argument draws on examples from the implementation of a manualized youth voice program (YVP) in two different organizations serving six distinct communities. Through a series of retreats, implementers identified examples of modifications made and grouped them into themes. Results suggest that some adaptations were actually indicators of fidelity to the key principles of YVPs: power-sharing, youth ownership, and engagement in social change. We therefore offer suggestions for re-conceptualizing the fidelity-adaptation debate, highlight implications for measurement and assessment, and illustrate that the de facto treatment of adaptation and fidelity as opposing constructs may limit the diffusion or scaling up of these types of youth programs.",Do healthcare financing systems influence hospital efficiency? A metafrontier approach for the case of Mexico.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659404,Health care management science,2019 01 19,"The objective of this article is to discuss the impact of healthcare financing systems on the efficiency of Mexican hospitals. The Mexican healthcare system is undergoing a process of transformation to establish conditions for allocating limited health resources in order to achieve efficiency and transparency; in this line, there is a concern about the implications of different funding options. In terms of financing arrangements, the Mexican health system is divided into three categories (one private and two public). In the framework of New Public Management theory, non-parametric metafrontier methods are used to estimate differences in efficiency of hospitals under different financing schemes, and in relation to the potential technology available in the healthcare system. Empirical evidence suggests that: 1) an out-of-pocket funding system, on average, incentivizes more efficient behavior; and 2) public funding seems to be the best option for complex and high-technology hospitals, and capitation appears to be the most appropriate way of negotiating their funding."

The present study characterizes unique intrinsic connectivity within- and between- neural networks in children through to adults with ASD, relative to controls. Resting state fMRI data were analyzed in 204 subjects, 102 with ASD and 102 age- and sex-matched controls (ages 7-40 years), acquired on a single scanner. ASD was assessed using the autism diagnostic observation schedule (ADOS). BOLD correlations were calculated between 47 regions of interest, spanning seven resting state brain networks. Partial least squares (PLS) analyses evaluated the association between connectivity patterns and ASD diagnosis as well as ASD severity scores. PLS demonstrated dissociable connectivity patterns in those with ASD, relative to controls. Similar patterns were observed in the whole cohort and in a subgroup analysis of subjects under 18 years of age. Greater inter-network connectivity was seen in ASD with greater intra-network connectivity in controls. In conclusion, stronger inter-network and weaker intra-network resting state-fMRI BOLD correlations characterize ASD and may differentiate control and ASD cohorts. These findings are relevant to understanding ASD as a disruption of network topology.",Fiberoptic microindentation technique for early osteoarthritis diagnosis: an in vitro study on human cartilage.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659388,Biomedical microdevices,2019 04 08,"In this study, the capability of a fiber optic microindenter sensor to discriminate between healthy and slightly degenerated human articular cartilage samples is demonstrated.

The indenter sensor is intended to assist the surgeon in the identification of damaged articular cartilage. From each of seven specimens of human tibia plateau three samples showing different Outerbridge grading were extracted. On each sample stress-relaxation measurements were performed with eight indentation steps, each step being 40 μm and the relaxation of the material was observed for 240 s after each step. A viscoelastic model was used to fit the relaxation and to extract the characteristic parameters according to the model.

Using linkage of Swedish national registers, we identified all Swedish residents aged 0-24 years that collected at least one antidepressant prescription (here defined as antidepressant users) between 1 January 2006 and 31 December 2013 (n = 174,237), and categorized them as children (0-11 years), adolescents (12-17 years), and young adults (18-24 years). Prevalence of antidepressant dispensation rose from 1.4 to 2.1% between 2006 and 2013, with the greatest relative increase in adolescents [by 97.8% in males (from 0.6 to 1.3%) and by 86.3% in females (from 1.1 to 2.1%)]. Most individuals across age categories were prescribed selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, received their prescriptions from psychiatric specialist care, and had treatment periods of over 12 months. Prevalence of CNS polypharmacy (dispensation of other CNS drug classes in addition to antidepressants) increased across age categories, with an overall increase in prevalence from 52.4% in 2006 to 62.1% in 2013. Children experienced the largest increase in polypharmacy of three or more psychotropic drug classes (4.4-10.1%). Anxiolytics, hypnotics, and sedatives comprised the most common additional CNS drug class among persons who were prescribed antidepressants. These findings show that the dispensation of antidepressants among the young is prevalent and growing in Sweden. The substantial degree of CNS polypharmacy in young patients receiving antidepressants requires careful monitoring and further research into potential benefits and harms.",Sleep problems and anxiety from 2 to 8 years and the influence of autistic traits: a longitudinal study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659385,European child & adolescent psychiatry,2019 01 19,"Whether or not childhood sleep problems and anxiety occur simultaneously, or one precedes the other, and any effect of autistic traits on this relationship remains unclear. We investigated longitudinal associations between sleep and anxiety at 2 years and sleep and anxiety at 8 years controlling for demographic variables. We also examined the additional influence of autistic traits at 2 years on sleep problems and anxiety at 8 years. Participants were from the Western Australian Pregnancy Cohort (Raine) Study, where 2900 pregnant women were recruited between 1989 and 1991 and their children assessed every 2-3 years thereafter. Demographic information was provided at 16-18 weeks gestation. Children's sleep and anxiety at 2 and 8 years and autistic traits at 2 years were measured using the Child Behavior Checklist. Hierarchical multiple regression models tested the prediction of both anxiety and sleep problems at 8 years. Sleep problems at 2 years and 8 years, anxiety at 2 years, and autistic traits at 2 years were significantly associated with anxiety at 8 years. Sleep problems at 2 years and anxiety at 8 years were significantly related to sleep problems at 8 years. Each of these models explained about 20% of variance. Childhood sleep problems, anxiety and autistic traits are interrelated and can occur concurrently in young children, but the best predictor of poor sleep in middle childhood is concurrent anxiety and vice versa. Anxiety and sleep problems may be an early indicator of autism in young children and early autistic traits may also contribute to anxiety problems later in childhood.",Effects of society and culture on parents' ratings of children's mental health problems in 45 societies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659384,European child & adolescent psychiatry,2019 03 13,"To improve international needs assessment for child mental health services, it is necessary to employ standardized assessment methods that can be easily administered and scored, can be interpreted by practitioners and researchers with various kinds of training, and that perform similarly across many societies. To this end, we tested the effects of both society and culture on parents' ratings of children's problems. We used hierarchical linear modeling as well as analyses of variance to analyze parents' Child Behavior Checklist ratings of 72,493 6- to 16-year-olds from 45 societies. The 45 societies were nested within 10 culture clusters based on the Global Leadership and Organizational Behavior Effectiveness (GLOBE) taxonomy. Societal differences accounted for 3.8-10.7% of variance in various kinds of problems, while differences between culture clusters (e.g., Anglo vs. Confucian) accounted for 0.1-10.0%. By contrast, differences associated with parents' ratings of individual children accounted for 85.5-93.3% of variance. Averaged across 17 problem scales, society plus culture cluster accounted for about 10% of the variance in parents' ratings of children's problems, whereas individual differences and other possible variables accounted for about 90%. These findings indicate that parents' standardized ratings can be used to assess effects associated with individual differences in child and adolescent psychopathology, over and above differences associated with societies and culture clusters.",Combining bulk and amino acid stable isotope analyses to quantify trophic level and basal resources of detritivores: a case study on earthworms.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659383,Oecologia,2019 03 03,"Quantification of the bacterial, fungal, and plant energy channels to the nutrition of detritivores is methodologically challenging. This is especially true for earthworms that ingest large amounts of litter and soil mixed with microorganisms. Novel methods such as compound-specific stable isotope analysis (CSIA) of C and N of individual amino acids promise major progress in this field in comparison with bulk stable isotope analysis (bulk SIA). Here, we combine CSIA and bulk SIA of carbon and nitrogen to quantify the linkage of epigeic and endogeic earthworm species to different energy channels across boreal and temperate forest ecosystems. The results showed pronounced flux of energy directly from plants to earthworms (33-50% of essential amino acids, EAA) refining the position of earthworms in soil food webs as both competitors and consumers of microorganisms. Epigeic earthworm species primarily relied on plant litter and endogeic species primarily relied on bacteria and soil organic matter. The linkage of both groups to plant or microbial energy channel was likely driven by the quality of detritus. Both bulk 15N and 13C enrichments were related to the trophic level of earthworms. Furthermore, 15N enrichment was related to the proportions of bacterial and plant EAA in the diet. Strong negative correlation between trophic level (CSIA of nitrogen) and the proportion of plant EAA (CSIA of carbon) suggests that both novel methods can indicate the degree of microbivory in detritivores. CSIA of amino acids provide detailed and baseline-independent information on basal resources and trophic levels of detritivores."

In the Czech Republic, the Ministry of the Interior has supported an analysis dealing with the risks to residents, infrastructure, and water bodies from flash floods and sediment transport. A total of more than 150,000 risk points were identified by GIS morphology and land-use analysis. The threat, the vulnerability, and the resulting risk category were determined for each of these points. The WaTEM/SEDEM model was used to assess the threat with 10-m data resolution. The summarized vulnerability of real objects on individual runoff trajectories was combined with the threat of sediment transport, resulting in the overall risk represented by a 5-degree scale, from lowest (1) to highest (5). The output of the project lies stored in the WEB application. Nineteen percent of the sites in the Czech Republic, i.e., more than 23,000 sites, have been assigned to categories 4 and 5, with a high level of risk. Thirty-four percent of cadastral units are classified as the high risky (4416 cadasters, with a total area 24,707 km2). Approximately 30% of the population of the Czech Republic lives in high-risk cadastral areas. Four scenarios of protection were modeled. To reduce the high-risk and very high-risk sites (categories 4 and 5), the most effective solution is the implementation of technical measures or conversion to grassland within the contributing watersheds. This could reduce the number of high-risk sites from 23,400 to 3700.Methods of sediment transport modeling and risk evaluation, based on presented USLE input data and documented WaTEM/SEDEM model, can be used worldwide.

Unique photophysical properties of fluorescent semiconductor nanocrystals ""quantum dots"" (QDs) make them advanced fluorophores for fluorescent labeling of biomolecules or optical encoding of microparticles to be used as bioimaging and theranostic agents in targeted delivery, visualization, diagnostics, and imaging. This paper reports on the results of development of an improved approach to the optical encoding of polyelectrolyte microcapsules with stable, covered with the multifunctional polyethyleneglycol derivatives water-soluble QDs, as well as characterization of the optical properties, morphological and structural properties of the encoded microcapsules. The embedding of QDs into the polymer microcapsule membrane through layer-by-layer deposition on a preliminarily formed polymeric polyelectrolyte shell makes it possible to obtain bright fluorescent particles with an adapted charge and size distribution that are distinctly discernible by flow cytometry as individual homogeneous populations. The fluorescent microcapsules developed can be used in further designing bioimaging and theranostic agents sensitive to various external stimuli along with photoexcitation.",Remote sensing estimation of chlorophyll-a concentration in Taihu Lake considering spatial and temporal variations.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659368,Environmental monitoring and assessment,2019 03 20,"The estimation of chlorophyll-a concentrations (Chla) in lakes using remote sensing is convenient, but its use remains challenging in large eutrophic water bodies due to the great spatial and temporal variations of its optical properties. Combining the sampling location and date information with Chla data, this study divided the lake water into three types, I, II and III, and then built an optimal Chla estimation model for each type based on 11 datasets collected from 2004 to 2012 in Taihu Lake, China. The resultant model expression is Chla = exp (ax2 + bx + c), where x is R701/R677, (1/R686-1/R695) × R710 and (R690/R550-R675/R700) / (R690/R550 + R675/R700). For the Chla ranging from 2 to 192 mg/m3, the root-mean-square error (RMSE) of the new model decreased up to 5.1 mg/m3 compared to that of previous band combination models, such as band ratio, three-band and four-band models when directly validated. The RMSE of the re-parametrization model (the lowest RMSE < 12 mg/m3) is also lower than for those models (the lowest RMSE > 16 mg/m3), indicating that the Chla estimation model that considers the spatial and temporal variations has a better performance and validation accuracy and therefore is more effective for remote sensing monitoring of water quality.","Inter-annual variability of phytoplankton assemblage and Tetraspora gelatinosa bloom from anthropogenically affected harbour, Veraval, India.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659367,Environmental monitoring and assessment,2019 03 20,"Veraval, one of Asia's largest fishing harbours, situated on the south-west coast of Gujarat, India, has transformed into an industrial hub dominated by fish processing units, rayon manufacturing industry, and transportation facilities. The study investigated the high abundance of Tetraspora gelatinosa along with the augmented level of ammonia in the harbour. The high concentration of ammonia was associated with the accumulation of sewage, industrial, and fishery wastes in the harbour. Low-energy expenditure associated with assimilation of ammonia made it a principal nitrogen source for Tetraspora gelatinosa growth. Even though ammonia is the preferred nitrogen source by phytoplankton, elevated concentration causes toxicity to the cells. Augmented level of ammonia and high TSS hampered the efficiency of PS II, thereby impeding the chlorophyll a degradation and oxygen evolution. Built of the organic load from fish processing industries as well as domestic waste along with a reduction in photosynthetic oxygen evolution has made the harbour hypoxic (DO < 1.6 mg L-1)/anoxic (DO = 0.0 mg L-1).

Mobility size distributions, number concentrations, molecular mass distributions, and polydispersity index of HAs were obtained successfully via a rapid analysis by ES-DMA (< 30 min). The limit of detection, the limit of quantification, and the precision of the mobility size measurement achieve 2.5 nm, 4.0 nm, and 0.3 nm, respectively. Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) was employed as an orthogonal approach, showing that the averaged molecular mass and polydispersity index of HA measured by ES-DMA were close to the results of SEC on a semi-quantitative basis. The 1,4-butanediol diglycidyl ether (BDDE)-induced crosslinking of HA was also able to be successfully characterized through a time-dependent study using ES-DMA, which has shown the promise of direct analysis of solution-based reactions. Both the extent and the rate of HA crosslinking (induced by BDDE) were proportional to reaction temperature and concentration ratio of HA to BDDE. The activation energy of the reaction-limited BDDE-induced crosslinking of HA was found to be ≈ 21 kJ/mol. The prototype study demonstrates ES-DMA as a new method for a rapid quantitative characterization of HA and its derivative product and providing a capability of real-time monitoring of the HA crosslinking during formulation process. Graphical abstract.",Roles of mitochondrial fission inhibition in developmental fluoride neurotoxicity: mechanisms of action in vitro and associations with cognition in rats and children.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659323,Archives of toxicology,2019 04 06,"Fluoride neurotoxicity is associated with mitochondrial disruption. Mitochondrial fission/fusion dynamics is crucial to maintain functional mitochondria, yet little is known about how fluoride perturbs this dynamics and whether such perturbation contributes to impaired neurodevelopment. Here in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells treated with sodium fluoride (NaF, 20, 40 and 60 mg/L), mitochondrial fission suppression exerted a central role in NaF-induced mitochondrial abnormalities and the resulting autophagy deficiency, apoptosis augmentation, and compromised neuronal survival. Mechanically, pharmacological inhibition of mitochondrial fission exacerbated NaF-induced mitochondrial defects and cell death through promoting apoptosis despite partial autophagy restoration. Conversely, genetic enhancement of mitochondrial fission alleviated NaF-produced detrimental mitochondrial and cellular outcomes by elevating autophagy and inhibiting apoptosis. Further suppressing autophagy was harmful, while blocking apoptosis was beneficial for cellular survival in this context. Consistently, using Sprague-Dawley rats developmentally exposed to NaF (10, 50, and 100 mg/L) from pre-pregnancy until 2 months of delivery to mimic human exposure, we showed that perinatal exposure to environmentally relevant levels of fluoride caused learning and memory impairments, accompanied by hippocampal mitochondrial morphological alterations manifested as fission suppression and fusion acceleration, along with defective autophagy, excessive apoptosis and neuronal loss. Intriguingly, the disturbed circulating levels of identified mitochondrial fission/fusion molecules were closely associated with intellectual loss in children under long-term environmental drinking water fluoride exposure. Collectively, our results suggest that mitochondrial fission inhibition induces mitochondrial abnormalities, triggering abnormal autophagy and apoptosis, thus contributing to neuronal death, and that the mitochondrial dynamics molecules may act as promising indicators for developmental fluoride neurotoxicity.",Boron-exposed male workers in Turkey: no change in sperm Y:X chromosome ratio and in offspring's sex ratio.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659322,Archives of toxicology,2019 04 06,"Boron-associated shifts in sex ratios at birth were suggested earlier and attributed to a decrease in Y- vs. X-bearing sperm cells. As the matter is pivotal in the discussion of reproductive toxicity of boron/borates, re-investigation in a highly borate-exposed population was required. In the present study, 304 male workers in Bandirma and Bigadic (Turkey) with different degrees of occupational and environmental exposure to boron were investigated. Boron was quantified in blood, urine and semen, and the persons were allocated to exposure groups along B blood levels. In the highest (""extreme"") exposure group (n = 69), calculated mean daily boron exposures, semen boron and blood boron concentrations were 44.91 ± 18.32 mg B/day, 1643.23 ± 965.44 ng B/g semen and 553.83 ± 149.52 ng B/g blood, respectively. Overall, an association between boron exposure and Y:X sperm ratios in semen was not statistically significant (p > 0.05). Also, the mean Y:X sperm ratios in semen samples of workers allocated to the different exposure groups were statistically not different in pairwise comparisons (p > 0.05). Additionally, a boron-associated shift in sex ratio at birth towards female offspring was not visible. In essence, the present results do not support an association between boron exposure and decreased Y:X sperm ratio in males, even under extreme boron exposure conditions.",Chemosensitization of hepatocellular carcinoma cells to sorafenib by β-caryophyllene oxide-induced inhibition of ABC export pumps.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659321,Archives of toxicology,2019 04 06,"Several ATP-binding cassette (ABC) proteins reduce intracellular concentrations of antitumor drugs and hence weaken the response of cancer cells to chemotherapy. Accordingly, the inhibition of these export pumps constitutes a promising strategy to chemosensitize highly chemoresistant tumors, such as hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Here, we have investigated the ability of β-caryophyllene oxide (CRYO), a naturally occurring sesquiterpene component of many essential oils, to inhibit, at non-toxic doses, ABC pumps and improve the response of HCC cells to sorafenib. First, we have obtained a clonal subline (Alexander/R) derived from human hepatoma cells with enhanced multidrug resistance (MDR) associated to up-regulation (mRNA and protein) of MRP1 and MRP2. Analysis of fluorescent substrates export (flow cytometry) revealed that CRYO did not affect the efflux of fluorescein (MRP3, MRP4 and MRP5) but inhibited that of rhodamine 123 (MDR1) and calcein (MRP1 and MRP2). This ability was higher for CRYO than for other sesquiterpenes assayed. CRYO also inhibited sorafenib efflux, increased its intracellular accumulation (HPLC-MS/MS) and enhanced its cytotoxic response (MTT). For comparison, the effect of known ABC pumps inhibitors was also determined. They induced strong (diclofenac on MRPs), modest (verapamil on MDR1) or null (fumitremorgin C on BCRP) effect on sorafenib efflux and cytotoxicity. In the mouse xenograft model, the response to sorafenib treatment of subcutaneous tumors generated by mouse hepatoma Hepa 1-6/R cells, with marked MDR phenotype, was significantly enhanced by CRYO co-administration. In conclusion, at non-toxic dose, CRYO is able to chemosensitizating liver cancer cells to sorafenib by favoring its intracellular accumulation.",Effects of cannabis tetrahydrocannabinol on endocannabinoid homeostasis in human placenta.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659320,Archives of toxicology,2019 04 06,"Cannabis use has become a hot topic in several countries due to the debate about its legalization for medical purposes. However, data are limited regarding adverse events, safety and potential impact on reproductive health. Cannabis consumption during pregnancy has been associated with gestational disorders such as preterm birth, intrauterine growth restriction, low birth weight and increased risk of miscarriage, though the underlying biochemical mechanisms are still unknown. Given that the endocannabinoid system (ECS) is involved in several reproductive processes, we tested the hypothesis that the negative outcomes may result from the impact on the ECS homeostasis caused by the main psychoactive compound of cannabis, Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). We demonstrate that THC (10-40 µM) impairs placental endocannabinoid system by disrupting the endocannabinoid anandamide (AEA) levels and the expression of AEA synthetic and degrading enzymes N-arachidonoylphosphatidylethanolamine-specific phospholipase D (NAPE-PLD) and fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), respectively. Although, no alterations in cannabinoid receptors CB1 and CB2 expression were observed. Thus, long-term local AEA levels are associated with a shift in the enzymatic profile to re-establish ECS homeostasis. In chronic cannabis users, high AEA levels in placenta may disturb the delicate balance of trophoblast cells turnover leading to alterations in normal placental development and foetal growth.",Lateral femoral sliding osteotomy in total knee arthroplasty with valgus deformity greater than twenty degrees.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659318,International orthopaedics,2019 01 19,"Lateral femoral sliding osteotomy has been reported as an effective technique for total knee arthroplasty (TKA) with significant valgus deformity.

Two uterine sarcomas and two carcinosarcoma cell lines were examined, as a control HSF were used. Cell viability was assessed with MTT test, apoptosis with caspase-3 activity and cell cycle by assessment of DNA synthesis. Fucoidan significantly decreases cell viability in SK-UT-1, SK-UT-1B, and ESS-1 cell lines, such effect was not observed in MES-SA. Fucoidan was not substantially affecting proliferation among normal cells. The tested agent induced apoptosis in all cell cultures used in the experiment. Fucoidan affects cell cycle of all tested cell lines except MES-SA by increasing percentage of cells in G0/sub-G1/G1 phase. Fucoidan do not only affect proliferation but induces apoptosis in selected uterine sarcoma and carcinosarcoma cell lines, so it has potential to be used as cytotoxic agent.

Strikingly, up to half of ICU patients receiving empirical antibiotic therapy have no definitively confirmed infection, while de-escalation and shortened treatment duration are insufficiently considered in those with documented sepsis, highlighting the potential benefit of implementing antibiotic stewardship programs (ASP) and other quality improvement initiatives. The objective of this narrative review is to summarize the available evidence, emerging options, and unsolved controversies for the optimization of antibiotic therapy in the ICU. Published data notably support the need for better identification of patients at risk of MDRB infection, more accurate diagnostic tools enabling a rule-in/rule-out approach for bacterial sepsis, an individualized reasoning for the selection of single-drug or combination empirical regimen, the use of adequate dosing and administration schemes to ensure the attainment of pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics targets, concomitant source control when appropriate, and a systematic reappraisal of initial therapy in an attempt to minimize collateral damage on commensal ecosystems through de-escalation and treatment-shortening whenever conceivable. This narrative review also aims at compiling arguments for the elaboration of actionable ASP in the ICU, including improved patient outcomes and a reduction in antibiotic-related selection pressure that may help to control the dissemination of MDRB in this healthcare setting."

Published data show that radical prostatectomy is associated with both an increase and decrease in testosterone levels. This study aimed to document the changes in pre- and postoperative serum testosterone levels after radical prostatectomy along with the associations between serum testosterone levels and prostate cancer profiles in Thai population. Localized and locally advanced prostate cancer patients who elected to have radical prostatectomy without prior androgen deprivation therapy were included in the study. Patients' demographic data, pre- and postoperative serum testosterone levels, sex hormone binding globulin, albumin, prostate-specific antigen, and final pathologic reports were collected. Eighty-five prostate cancer patients were included in this study. Mean age was 67.32 years. Mean pre- and postoperative serum testosterone levels were 424.95 ng/dL and 371.94 ng/dL, respectively (p-value < 0.001). There was a greater testosterone reduction in patients with a final pathologic report of Gleason 4 + 3 and above compared with those with a Gleason 3 + 3 and 3 + 4 (p-value = 0.001). No significant association between preoperative testosterone levels and final Gleason scores was observed. This study documented significant postoperative testosterone reductions in prostate cancer patients after a radical prostatectomy. Patients with high Gleason grades had greater testosterone reductions. These findings may have clinical implications for the prediction of postoperative hypogonadal states in prostate cancer patients.",Differences between ICD-11 MMS and DSM-5 definition of premature ejaculation: a continuation of historical inadequacies and a source of serious misinterpretation by some European Regulatory Agencies (PART 2).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659291,International journal of impotence research,2019 01 19,"Recently, the ICD-11 for Mortality and Morbidity Statistics (ICD-11-MMS, 2018 Version) has been published with a new definition of premature ejaculation (PE), including a third PE subtype. This definition differs from Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) definition of PE. We hereby address the similarities and differences between ICD-11-MMS and DSM-5 definition of PE and call attention to the illogical policy of some European (EU) National Regulatory Agencies to remain with a 1-min cut-off point of ejaculation time for Lifelong, Acquired and Subjective PE. The advantage of ICD-11-MMS is the inclusion of a third PE subtype, which is congruent with Subjective PE. A serious disadvantage of DSM-5 is that a 1-min criterion is used for both Lifelong and Acquired PE, and that a third PE subtype is not mentioned. Despite the incomplete DSM-5 definition of PE, some EU regulatory agencies adhere to a definition of PE which relies only on the 1-min ejaculation time cut-off point of DSM-5, and do not recognize the more recent PE definitions of ICD-11-MMS and International Society for Sexual Medicine. There is no scientific evidence for this illogical position. The continued use of a 1-min cut-off point for all subgroups of PE ignores the existence of Acquired PE (Intravaginal Ejaculation Latency Time (IELT) <3 min) and Subjective PE (IELT <approx. 6 min), both of which have been shown to be clinically and psychologically important. In conclusion, some EU regulatory agencies are not recognizing ongoing developments in the definition of three different subgroups of PE. We propose combining the DSM-5 and ICD-11 MMS definitions to optimize the whole PE spectrum for future registered drug treatment studies, so that it properly reflects patient needs.",Author Correction: Landscape of somatic mutations in 560 breast cancer whole-genome sequences.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659290,Nature,2019 05 28,"In the Methods section of this Article, 'greater than' should have been 'less than' in the sentence 'Putative regions of clustered rearrangements were identified as having an average inter-rearrangement distance that was at least 10 times greater than the whole-genome average for the individual sample. '.

However, the role of histone methylation enzymes in the pathophysiology and treatment of autism remains unknown. To address this, we used mouse models of haploinsufficiency of the Shank3 gene (a highly penetrant monogenic autism risk factor), which exhibits prominent autism-like social deficits. We found that histone methyltransferases EHMT1 and EHMT2, as well as histone lysine 9 dimethylation (specifically catalyzed by EHMT1/2), were selectively increased in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of Shank3-deficient mice and autistic human postmortem brains. Treatment with the EHMT1/2 inhibitor UNC0642 or knockdown of EHMT1/2 in PFC induced a robust rescue of autism-like social deficits in Shank3-deficient mice, and restored NMDAR-mediated synaptic function. Activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein (Arc) was identified as one of the causal factors underlying the rescuing effects of UNC0642 on NMDAR function and social behaviors in Shank3-deficient mice. UNC0642 treatment also restored a large set of genes involved in neural signaling in PFC of Shank3-deficient mice. These results suggest that targeting histone methylation enzymes to adjust gene expression and ameliorate synaptic defects could be a potential therapeutic strategy for autism.",Genetic and environmental influences on structural brain measures in twins with autism spectrum disorder.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659287,Molecular psychiatry,2019 02 07,"Atypical growth patterns of the brain have been previously reported in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) but these alterations are heterogeneous across individuals, which may be associated with the variable effects of genetic and environmental influences on brain development. Monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs with and without ASD (aged 6-15 years) were recruited to participate in this study. T1-weighted MRIs (n = 164) were processed with FreeSurfer to evaluate structural brain measures. Intra-class correlations were examined within twin pairs and compared across diagnostic groups. ACE modeling was also completed. Structural brain measures, including cerebral and cerebellar gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) volume, surface area, and cortical thickness, were primarily influenced by genetic factors in TD twins; however, mean curvature appeared to be primarily influenced by environmental factors. Similarly, genetic factors accounted for the majority of variation in brain size in twins with ASD, potentially to a larger extent regarding curvature and subcortical GM; however, there were also more environmental contributions in twins with ASD on some structural brain measures, such that cortical thickness and cerebellar WM volume were primarily influenced by environmental factors. These findings indicate potential neurobiological outcomes of the genetic and environmental risk factors that have been previously associated with ASD and, although preliminary, may help account for some of the previously outlined neurobiological heterogeneity across affected individuals. This is especially relevant regarding the role of genetic and environmental factors in the development of ASD, in which certain brain structures may be more sensitive to specific influences.",Prognostic factors for one-year mortality in patients with acute heart failure with and without chronic kidney disease: differential impact of beta-blocker and diuretic treatments.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659283,Hypertension research : official journal of the Japanese Society of Hypertension,2019 06 15,"The pathophysiology and treatment of acute decompensated heart failure (HF) in the presence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) remain ill defined. Here we compared the prognostic factors for 1-year mortality in patients with acute HF with and without CKD. We retrospectively studied 392 consecutive patients with acute decompensated HF. CKD as a comorbidity in these patients was defined by an estimated glomerular filtration rate of <60 mL/min/1.73 m2. Potential risk factors for 1-year mortality were selected by univariate analyses; then multivariate Cox regression analysis with forward selection (likelihood ratio) was performed to identify significant factors. Across the study cohort, 65% of patients had CKD, and the 1-year mortality rate was 9.2%. In the HF with CKD group, older age, lower systolic blood pressure at admission, discharge medications without beta-blockers, and discharge medications without diuretics were independent risk factors for 1-year mortality. In contrast, coexisting chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and higher C-reactive protein levels were independent risk factors for 1-year mortality in the HF without CKD group. Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed that discharge medications with no beta-blockers or diuretics correlated with significantly lower survival rates in patients with CKD (P < 0.001 in both groups, log-rank test), but not in patients without CKD (P = 0.822 and P = 0.374, respectively, log-rank test). Thus, there were significant differences in the prognostic factors for 1-year mortality between acute HF patients with and without CKD including beta-blocker and diuretic treatments. These findings suggest that patients with HF might benefit from individualized therapies.",Spatial proteomics: a powerful discovery tool for cell biology.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659282,Nature reviews. Molecular cell biology,2019 04 25,"Protein subcellular localization is tightly controlled and intimately linked to protein function in health and disease. Capturing the spatial proteome - that is, the localizations of proteins and their dynamics at the subcellular level - is therefore essential for a complete understanding of cell biology. Owing to substantial advances in microscopy, mass spectrometry and machine learning applications for data analysis, the field is now mature for proteome-wide investigations of spatial cellular regulation. Studies of the human proteome have begun to reveal a complex architecture, including single-cell variations, dynamic protein translocations, changing interaction networks and proteins localizing to multiple compartments. Furthermore, several studies have successfully harnessed the power of comparative spatial proteomics as a discovery tool to unravel disease mechanisms. We are at the beginning of an era in which spatial proteomics finally integrates with cell biology and medical research, thereby paving the way for unbiased systems-level insights into cellular processes. Here, we discuss current methods for spatial proteomics using imaging or mass spectrometry and specifically highlight global comparative applications. The aim of this Review is to survey the state of the field and also to encourage more cell biologists to apply spatial proteomics approaches.",Difference in positive relation between cardio-ankle vascular index (CAVI) and each of four blood pressure indices in real-world Japanese population.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659281,Journal of human hypertension,2019 03 10,"This study aimed to investigate the association of cardio-ankle vascular index (CAVI), an arterial stiffness parameter, with four blood pressure (BP) indices, systolic BP (SBP), diastolic BP (DBP), pulse pressure (PP) and mean BP (MBP), in real-world population including untreated hypertension. We analyzed the cross-sectional data from 23,257 Japanese subjects (12,729 men and 10,528 women, aged 47.1 years) without a past history of cardiovascular disease, stroke, hypertension, diabetes or dyslipidemia. Gender differences in four BP indices were slight, but significant for SBP, DBP and MBP. All four BP indices increased linearly with age. After adjusting for confounders comprising gender, age, HDL-C and BMI identified by multiple regression analysis, CAVI was lower in normotensive subjects compared to hypertensive subjects. Trend test detected an almost linear relation of adjusted CAVI with each of four BP indices even within ideal range. Exceptionally, the increment in adjusted CAVI reached its peak over 140 mm Hg range in SBP. Logistic regression models showed that 1-SD increment in each BP index contributed independently to high CAVI (≥90th percentile), whereas that in PP showed a somewhat lower contribution. Subgroup analyses revealed that older age, dyslipidemia and hypertension were independently associated with relatively small contributions to high CAVI per 1-SD increment in SBP. PP might be less useful to assess arterial stiffness compared to other BP indices. Besides, the contribution of SBP increment to arterial stiffening was relatively large in normotensive, normolipidemic non-elderly subjects, whose individual transition of SBP should be noticed."

We then evaluated the prognostic significance of MEOX2 protein expression on 112 glioma clinical samples including; 56 IDH1 wildtype glioblastomas, 7 IDH1 wild-type lower grade gliomas, 49 IDH1 mutated lower grade gliomas. Survival rates were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method followed by uni/multivariate analyses. We demonstrated that MEOX2 was one of the transcription factors most closely associated with overall survival in glioma. Moreover, MEOX2 expression was associated with IDH1/2 wildtype molecular subtype and was significantly correlated with overall survival of all gliomas and, more interestingly, in lower grade glioma. To conclude, our results may be the first to provide insight into the clinical significance of MEOX2 in gliomas, which is a factor closely related to patient outcome. MEOX2 could constitute an interesting prognostic biomarker, especially for lower grade glioma.",B-Raf deficiency impairs tumor initiation and progression in a murine breast cancer model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659267,Oncogene,2019 03 04,"Copy number gains, point mutations and epigenetic silencing events are increasingly observed in genes encoding elements of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling axis in human breast cancer. The three Raf kinases A-Raf, B-Raf, and Raf-1 have an important role as gatekeepers in ERK pathway activation and are often dysregulated by somatic alterations of their genes or by the aberrant activity of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and Ras-GTPases. B-Raf represents the most potent Raf isoform and a critical effector downstream of RTKs and RAS proteins. Aberrant RTK signaling is mimicked by the polyoma middle T antigen (PyMT), which activates various oncogenic signaling pathways, incl. the RAS/ERK axis, in a similar manner as RTKs in human breast cancer. Mammary epithelial cell directed expression of PyMT in mice by the MMTV-PyMT transgene induces mammary hyperplasia progressing over adenoma to metastatic breast cancer with an almost complete penetrance. To understand the functional role of B-Raf in this model for luminal type B breast cancer, we crossed MMTV-PyMT mice with animals that either lack B-Raf expression in the mammary gland or express the signaling impaired B-RafAVKA mutant. The AVKA mutation prevents phosphorylation of T599 and S602 in the B-Raf activation loop and thereby activation of the kinase by upstream signals. We demonstrate for the first time that B-Raf expression and activation is important for tumor initiation in vivo as well as for lung metastasis. Isogenic tumor cell lines generated from conditional Braf knock-out or knock-in mice displayed a reduction in EGF-induced ERK pathway activity as well as in proliferation and invasive growth in three-dimensional matrigel cultures. Our results suggest that B-Raf, which has been hardly studied in the context of breast cancer, represents a critical effector of the PyMT oncoprotein and invite for an assessment of its functional role in human breast cancer.",The m6A methyltransferase METTL3 promotes bladder cancer progression via AFF4/NF-κB/MYC signaling network.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659266,Oncogene,2019 05 12,"N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most abundant modification in eukaryotic messenger RNAs (mRNAs), and plays important roles in many bioprocesses. However, its functions in bladder cancer (BCa) remain elusive. Here, we discovered that methyltransferase-like 3 (METTL3), a major RNA N6-adenosine methyltransferase, was significantly up-regulated in human BCa. Knockdown of METTL3 drastically reduced BCa cell proliferation, invasion, and survival in vitro and tumorigenicity in vivo. On the other hand, overexpression of METTL3 significantly promoted BCa cell growth and invasion. Through transcriptome sequencing, m6A sequencing and m6A methylated RNA immuno-precipitation quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, we revealed the profile of METTL3-mediated m6A modification in BCa cells for the first time. AF4/FMR2 family member 4 (AFF4), two key regulators of NF-κB pathway (IKBKB and RELA) and MYC were further identified as direct targets of METTL3-mediated m6A modification. In addition, we showed that besides NF-κB, AFF4 binds to the promoter of MYC and promotes its expression, implying a novel multilevel regulatory network downstream of METTL3. Our results uncovered an AFF4/NF-κB/MYC signaling network operated by METTL3-mediated m6A modification and provided insight into the mechanisms of BCa progression.",Oxygen sensor FIH inhibits HACE1-dependent ubiquitination of Rac1 to enhance metastatic potential in breast cancer cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659265,Oncogene,2019 05 12,"Oxygen is an indispensable element for cell survival and maintenance. Eukaryotic cells are equipped with a series of signaling pathways that cope with hypoxia. The dioxygenase factor inhibiting HIF (FIH) is an oxygen sensor that regulates the transcriptional activity of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) through asparaginyl hydroxylation. Given that HACE1 was detected as an FIH-interacting protein in a previous proteomics study, we tested whether the E3 ubiquitin ligase HACE1 is a substrate for FIH. FIH interacted with HACE1, in cells and in vitro, and was determined to hydroxylate HACE1 at the N191 residue within the ankyrin repeat domain. Hydroxylation disrupted the physical association between HACE1 and its representative target, Rac1. Under hypoxic conditions, HACE1 is less hydroxylated due to the inactivation of FIH, and subsequently functions to ubiquitinate the active form of Rac1, leading to the proteasomal degradation of Rac1. Since Rac1 stimulates cell movement, HACE1 inhibits cell migration and invasion in breast cancer by removing active Rac1. Such an effect of HACE1 is reinforced under hypoxia because HACE1 escapes from FIH-mediated hydroxylation. In clinical datasets, HACE1 downregulation is associated with poor outcomes in patients with breast cancer. Taken together, FIH is likely to act as an oxygen sensor that determines oxygen-dependent cancer progression.","Clinical phenotype, in silico and biomedical analyses, and intervention for an East Asian population-specific c.370G>A (p.G124S) COQ4 mutation in a Chinese family with CoQ10 deficiency-associated Leigh syndrome.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659264,Journal of human genetics,2019 03 14,"COQ4 mutations have recently been shown to cause a broad spectrum of mitochondrial disorders in association with CoQ10 deficiency. Herein, we report the clinical phenotype, in silico and biochemical analyses, and intervention for a novel c.370 G > A (p.G124S) COQ4 mutation in a Chinese family. This mutation is exclusively present in the East Asian population (allele frequency of ~0.001). The homozygous mutation caused CoQ10 deficiency-associated Leigh syndrome with an onset at 1-2 months of age, presenting as respiratory distress, lactic acidosis, dystonia, seizures, failure to thrive, and detectable lesions in the midbrain and basal ganglia. No renal impairment was involved. The levels of CoQ10 and mitochondrial respiratory chain complex (C) II + III activity were clearly lower in cultured fibroblasts derived from the patient than in those from unaffected carriers; the decreased CII + III activity could be increased by CoQ10 treatment. Follow-up studies suggested that our patient benefitted from the oral supplementation of CoQ10, which allowed her to maintain a relatively stable health status. Based on the genetic testing, preimplantation and prenatal diagnoses were performed, confirming that the next offspring of this family was unaffected. Our cases expand the phenotypic spectrum of COQ4 mutations and the genotypic spectrum of Leigh syndrome.",Tribological and mechanical investigation of multi-directional forged nickel.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659263,Scientific reports,2019 01 24,"Tailoring material properties to specific application requirements is one of the major challenges in materials engineering. Grain size is a key factor affecting physical and mechanical properties of polycrystals materials, the presented work enables insight into how the pure nickel properties are affected by application of multi-directional forging (MDF) as a well-known severe plastic deformation method. It is demonstrated that the hardness and wear rate are improved by imposing MDF process. The rate of enhancement is reduced at the higher pass numbers. It is also shown that the application of MDF process changed the mechanism of wear. Non-MDF sample's surface shows spalling and delamination, while the dominated wear mechanism of final pass sample is peeling with a slight of adhesion. The change of wear mechanism can be associated with the reduction of friction coefficient of the deformed sample. By considering the linear correlation between the hardness and wear rate, a simple and fast procedure is proposed to estimate the wear rate of sample after the different MDF pass numbers using the corresponding hardness magnitude. Additionally, the attained microstructure of the final pass sample shows a combination of ultrafine grains and micro shear bands.",Enriched power of disease-concordant twin-case-only design in detecting interactions in genome-wide association studies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659261,European journal of human genetics : EJHG,2019 03 29,"Genetic interaction is a crucial issue in the understanding of functional pathways underlying complex diseases. However, detecting such interaction effects is challenging in terms of both methodology and statistical power. We address this issue by introducing a disease-concordant twin-case-only design, which applies to both monozygotic and dizygotic twins. To investigate the power, we conducted a computer simulation study by setting a series of parameter schemes with different minor allele frequencies and relative risks. Results from the simulation study reveals that the disease-concordant twin-case-only design largely reduces sample size required for sufficient power compared to the ordinary case-only design for detecting gene-gene interaction using unrelated individuals. Sample sizes for dizygotic and monozygotic twins were roughly 1/2 and 1/4 of sample sizes in the ordinary case-only design. Since dizygotic twins are genetically similar as siblings, the enriched power for dizygotic twins also applies to affected siblings, which could help to largely extend the application of the powerful twin-case-only design. In summary, our simulation reveals high value of disease-concordant twins and siblings in efficiently detecting gene-by-gene interactions.","Biallelic intragenic duplication in ADGRB3 (BAI3) gene associated with intellectual disability, cerebellar atrophy, and behavioral disorder.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659260,European journal of human genetics : EJHG,2019 03 29,"In recent years, chromosomal microarray analysis has permitted the discovery of rearrangements underlying several neurodevelopmental disorders and still represents the first diagnostic test for unexplained neurodevelopmental disabilities. Here we report a family of consanguineous parents showing psychiatric disorders and their two sons both affected by intellectual disability, ataxia, and behavioral disorder. SNP/CGH array analysis in this family demonstrated in both siblings a biallelic duplication inherited from the heterozygous parents, disrupting the ADGRB3 gene. ADGRB3, also known as BAI3, belongs to the subfamily of adhesion G protein-coupled receptors (adhesion GPCRs) that regulate many aspects of the central nervous system, including axon guidance, myelination, and synapse formation. Single nucleotide polymorphisms and copy number variants involving ADGRB3 have recently been associated with psychiatric disorders. These findings further support this association and also suggest that biallelic variants affecting the function of the ADGRB3 gene may also cause cognitive impairments and ataxia.",Genetic basis for plasma amino acid concentrations based on absolute quantification: a genome-wide association study in the Japanese population.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659259,European journal of human genetics : EJHG,2019 03 29,"To assess the use of plasma free amino acids (PFAAs) as biomarkers for metabolic disorders, it is essential to identify genetic factors that influence PFAA concentrations. PFAA concentrations were absolutely quantified by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry using plasma samples from 1338 Japanese individuals, and genome-wide quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis was performed for the concentrations of 21 PFAAs. We next conducted a conditional QTL analysis using the concentration of each PFAA adjusted by the other 20 PFAAs as covariates to elucidate genetic determinants that influence PFAA concentrations. We identified eight genes that showed a significant association with PFAA concentrations, of which two, SLC7A2 and PKD1L2, were identified. SLC7A2 was associated with the plasma levels of arginine and ornithine, and PKD1L2 with the level of glycine. The significant associations of these two genes were revealed in the conditional QTL analysis, but a significant association between serine and the CPS1 gene disappeared when glycine was used as a covariate. We demonstrated that conditional QTL analysis is useful for determining the metabolic pathways predominantly used for PFAA metabolism. Our findings will help elucidate the physiological roles of genetic components that control the metabolism of amino acids.","Adenovirus 36 seropositivity is related to obesity risk, glycemic control, and leptin levels in Chilean subjects.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659258,International journal of obesity (2005),2019 01 19,Adenovirus 36 (Ad-36) has been associated to adiposity in animal and in vitro studies.

GSD VI is caused by deficient activity of hepatic glycogen phosphorylase, an enzyme encoded by the PYGL gene. GSD IX is caused by deficient activity of phosphorylase kinase (PhK), the enzyme subunits of which are encoded by various genes: ɑ (PHKA1, PHKA2), β (PHKB), ɣ (PHKG1, PHKG2), and δ (CALM1, CALM2, CALM3). Glycogen storage disease types VI and IX have a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations and often cannot be distinguished from each other, or from other liver GSDs, on clinical presentation alone. Individuals with GSDs VI and IX can present with hepatomegaly with elevated serum transaminases, ketotic hypoglycemia, hyperlipidemia, and poor growth.

Rheumatology,2019 02 23,"Patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) frequently show symptoms of central nervous system (CNS) involvement, termed neuropsychiatric SLE (NPSLE). The CNS manifestations of SLE are diverse and have a broad spectrum of severity and prognostic implications. Patients with NPSLE typically present with nonspecific symptoms, such as headache and cognitive impairment, but might also experience devastating features, such as memory loss, seizures and stroke. Some features of NPSLE, in particular those related to coagulopathy, have been characterized and an evidence-based treatment algorithm is available. The cognitive and affective manifestations of NPSLE, however, remain poorly understood. Various immune effectors have been evaluated as contributors to its pathogenesis, including brain-reactive autoantibodies, cytokines and cell-mediated inflammation. Additional brain-intrinsic elements (such as resident microglia, the blood-brain barrier and other neurovascular interfaces) are important facilitators of NPSLE. As yet, however, no unifying model has been found to underlie the pathogenesis of NPSLE, suggesting that this disease has multiple contributors and perhaps several distinct aetiologies. This heterogeneity presents a challenge for clinicians who have traditionally relied on empirical judgement in choosing treatment modalities for patients with NPSLE. Improved understanding of this manifestation of SLE might yield further options for managing this disease.",Clinical pathophysiology of thyroid eye disease: The Cone Model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659242,"Eye (London, England)",2019 03 21,"The clinical features of thyroid eye disease are dictated by the orbit's compartmentalisation; particularly, the muscle cone, which is delimited by the rectus muscles, their inter-muscular septa and the posterior sclera. The cone is anchored to the orbit apex and contains the posterior globe, the muscle bellies, a fat pad, and the blood circulation, optic nerve, and CSF sheath. It is surrounded by mobile extraconal fat, retained by the orbital septum.Thyroid eye disease is caused by expansion of muscle bellies and fat within the cone. Mechanical properties of the cone determine that the disease partitions into three phases: circumferential expansion, with forward displacement of extraconal fat; axial elongation, with increasing cone pressure; impedance of posterior venous outflow, with cone oedema and venous flow reversal.Venous flow reversal can be observed in the conjunctival circulation. It is initially transient, accompanying rises in cone pressure caused by eye movements, but later becomes permanent. It is a useful clinical sign that locates diseased muscles and anticipates venous compressive crises.Strabismus arises when inflamed rectus muscles, swollen by hydrated glycosaminoglycans, lose contractility and compliance. The incomitance is moderated by increasing stiffness affecting all the rectus muscles, as they are stretched during cone expansion.Immunomodulation, which rapidly reduces cone volume, relieving muscle elongation and stiffness, may paradoxically unmask strabismus. However, ciclosporin A suppresses late post-inflammatory fibrosis and only 4 of 71 patients so-treated required strabismus surgery.The cone model also accounts for the variety of clinical presentations of thyroid eye disease.",A comparative analysis of hepatic pathological phenotypes in C57BL/6J and C57BL/6N mouse strains in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis models.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659241,Scientific reports,2019 01 24,"C57BL/6J (BL6J) and C57BL/6N (BL6N) inbred substrains are most widely used to understand the pathological roles of target molecules in a variety of diseases, including non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), based on transgenic mouse technologies. There are notable differences in the metabolic phenotypes, including glucose tolerance, between the BL6J and BL6N substrains, but the phenotypic differences in NASH are still unknown. We performed a comparative analysis of the two mouse substrains to identify the pathological phenotypic differences in NASH models. In the CCl4-induced NASH model, the BL6J mice exhibited a more severe degree of oxidative stress and fibrosis in the liver than the BL6N mice. In contrast, in the high-fat diet-induced NASH model, more accumulation of hepatic triglycerides but less weight gain and liver injury were noted in the BL6J mice than in the BL6N mice. Our findings strongly suggest caution be exercised with the use of unmatched mixed genetic background C57BL6 mice for studies related to NASH, especially when generating conditional knockout C57BL6 mice.",Publisher Correction: Radioactive drugs emerge from the shadows to storm the market.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659240,Nature biotechnology,2019 03 15,"In the version of this article initially published, Betalutin was described as directing a radioisotope to CD45-expressing B cells; in fact, it directs it to CD37-expressing B cells.

One critical issue in this endeavour is the isolation of conceptual from perceptual contributions to category-differences. An unambiguous way to address this confound is combining multiple input-modalities. To this end, we showed participants person/place stimuli using name and picture modalities. Using multivariate methods, we searched for category-sensitive neural patterns shared across input-modalities and thus independent from perceptual properties. The millisecond temporal resolution of magnetoencephalography (MEG) allowed us to consider the precise timing of conceptual access and, by confronting latencies between the two modalities (""time generalization""), how latencies of processing depends on the input-modality. Our results identified category-sensitive conceptual representations common between modalities at three stages and that conceptual access for words was delayed by about 90 msec with respect to pictures. We also show that for pictures, the first conceptual pattern of activity (shared between both words and pictures) occurs as early as 110 msec. Collectively, our results indicated that conceptual access at the category-level is a multistage process and that different delays in access across these two input-modalities determine when these representations are activated.",The mitochondrial retrograde signaling regulates Wnt signaling to promote tumorigenesis in colon cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659235,Cell death and differentiation,2019 01 25,"Cancer cells are known to upregulate aerobic glycolysis to promote growth, proliferation, and survival. However, the role of mitochondrial respiration in tumorigenesis remains elusive. Here we report that inhibition of mitochondrial function by silencing TFAM, a key transcription factor essential for mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) replication and the transcription of mtDNA-encoded genes, markedly reduced tumor-initiating potential of colon cancer cells. Knockdown of TFAM significantly decreased mitochondrial respiration in colon cancer cells; however, the cellular levels of ATP remained largely unchanged as a result of increased glycolysis. This metabolic alteration rendered cancer cells highly susceptible to glucose deprivation. Interestingly, upregulation of glycolysis was independent of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF1) as TFAM knockdown cells fail to stabilize HIF1α under hypoxic conditions. Moreover, knockdown of TFAM results in decreased expression of genes-associated cancer stem cells downstream of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Metabolic analysis reveals that the level of α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) was significantly upregulated in TFAM knockout cells. Silencing of prolyl hydroxylase domain-containing protein 2 (PHD2), a α-KG-dependent dioxyenase, rescued the expression of target genes of both HIF1α and Wnt/β-catenin. Furthermore, intestinal-specific knockout of TFAM prevents tumor formation in Apc-mutant mouse models of colon cancer. Taken together, our findings identify a novel role of mitochondria-mediated retrograde signaling in regulating Wnt signaling and tumor initiation in colon cancer.","The good, the bad and the autophagosome: exploring unanswered questions of autophagy-dependent cell death.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659234,Cell death and differentiation,2019 03 29,"The recent discovery of autosis as a variant of autophagy-dependent cell death has challenged the conventional understanding of cell death and programmed cell death in cellular decision making. In contrast to previous accounts of distinct cell death modalities, autosis occurs with high autophagic activity, in the absence of apoptotic and necrotic markers and yet is not fully regulated by typical autophagy markers. Given the metabolic importance of autophagic responses and the extensive cross-talk with both apoptosis and necrosis signalling, the classical and morphotype-driven characterization of cell death as pre-determined subroutines is being increasingly called into question. Furthermore, the conflicting evidence with regards to cell death induction through autophagy modulation in various cancer models highlights the lack of consensus over the extent to which autophagy assists in cell death ontrol and whether it is capable of being a bona fide lethal process. This review evaluates the evidence and context of autophagy-dependent cell death and delineates the role of an autophagic flux threshold associated with 'lethal' and 'non-lethal' autophagy and its role in autosis control. In doing so, cancer treatment avenues will be explored with regards to precision modulation of tumour autophagic flux to ascertain whether autosis induction may present a novel therapeutic strategy."

But can novel environments reveal plasticity by causing a shift in a behavior as fundamental and conspicuous as daily activity? We studied daily activity times near the invasion front of the cane toad (Rhinella marina), an invasive species that has colonized much of northern Australia. Cane toads in Australia are nocturnal, probably because diurnal activity would subject them to intolerably hot and dry conditions in the tropical savannah during the dry season. Our study can demonstrate, however, that upon reaching novel environments some toad populations became diurnal. Sandstone gorges offered cane toads novel, deeply shaded habitat. Gorges with an east-west axis (day-long northern shadow), narrow gorges and narrow sections of gorges contained toads that were primarily diurnal, while gorges with a north-south axis, wide gorges and wide sections of gorges contained mainly nocturnal toads. For example, remote camera data (1314 observations of toad activity times over 789 trap days) revealed strictly nocturnal activity at four 'exposed' sites (99% of 144 observations over 179 days), compared to mostly diurnal activity at a 'shaded' site (78% of 254 observations). Visual encounter surveys confirmed that diurnal activity occurred exclusively at shaded sites, while most nocturnal activity occurred at exposed sites. The close proximity of diurnal and nocturnal toads (4-7 km) provided compelling evidence for the abovementioned physical factors as the proximate cause of the behavioral dichotomy, and for a novel (deeply shaded gorges) environment causing the shift to diurnal activity.",Investigation of Cavity Enhanced XEOL of a Single ZnO Microrod by Using Multifunctional Hard X-ray Nanoprobe.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659221,Scientific reports,2019 01 24,"The multifunctional hard X-ray nanoprobe at Taiwan Photon Source (TPS) exhibits the excellent ability to simultaneously characterize the X-ray absorption, X-ray excited optical luminescence (XEOL) as well as the dynamics of XEOL of materials. Combining the scanning electron microscope (SEM) into the TPS 23A end-station, we can easily and quickly measure the optical properties to map out the morphology of a ZnO microrod. A special phenomenon has been observed that the oscillations in the XEOL associated with the confinement of the optical photons in the single ZnO microrod shows dramatical increase while the X-ray excitation energy is set across the Zn K-edge. Besides having the nano-scale spatial resolution, the synchrotron source also gives a good temporal domain measurement to investigate the luminescence dynamic process. The decay lifetimes of different emission wavelengths and can be simultaneously obtained from the streak image.

Previous studies have mainly focused on sensorimotor aspects of joint action, with measurements reflecting event-to-event precision of interpersonal sensorimotor coordination (e.g., tapping). However, while emotional factors are often closely tied to joint actions, they are rarely studied, as event-to-event measurements are insufficient to capture higher-order aspects of joint action such as emotional expression. To quantify joint emotional expression, we used motion capture to simultaneously measure the body sway of each musician in a trio (piano, violin, cello) during performances. Excerpts were performed with or without emotional expression. Granger causality was used to analyze body sway movement time series amongst musicians, which reflects information flow. Results showed that the total Granger-coupling of body sway in the ensemble was higher when performing pieces with emotional expression than without. Granger-coupling further correlated with the emotional intensity as rated by both the ensemble members themselves and by musician judges, based on the audio recordings alone. Together, our findings suggest that Granger-coupling of co-actors' body sways reflects joint emotional expression in a music ensemble, and thus provide a novel approach to studying joint emotional expression.",Edge effect pinning in mesoscopic superconducting strips with non-uniform distribution of defects.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659219,Scientific reports,2019 01 24,"Transport characteristics of nano-sized superconducting strips and bridges are determined by an intricate interplay of surface and bulk pinning. In the limiting case of a very narrow bridge, the critical current is mostly defined by its surface barrier, while in the opposite case of very wide strips it is dominated by its bulk pinning properties. Here we present a detailed study of the intermediate regime, where the critical current is determined, both, by randomly placed pinning centres and by the Bean-Livingston barrier at the edge of the superconducting strip in an external magnetic field. We use the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equations to describe the vortex dynamics and current distribution in the critical regime. Our studies reveal that while the bulk defects arrest vortex motion away from the edges, defects in their close vicinity promote vortex penetration, thus suppressing the critical current. We determine the spatial distribution of the defects optimizing the critical current and find that it is in general non-uniform and asymmetric: the barrier at the vortex-exit edge influence the critical current much stronger than the vortex-entrance edge. Furthermore, this optimized defect distribution has a more than 30% higher critical current density than a homogeneously disorder superconducting film.",A near infrared light emitting electrochemical cell with a 2.3 V turn-on voltage.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659218,Scientific reports,2019 01 23,"We report on an organic electroluminescent device with simplified geometry and emission in the red to near infrared (NIR) spectral region which, has the lowest turn-on voltage value, 2.3 V, among light emitting electrochemical cells (LEECs). We have synthesized and characterized three novel ruthenium π-extended phenanthroimidazoles which differ on their N^N ligands. The use of dimethyl electron donating groups along with the π-extended phenanthroimidazole moiety promotes ambipolar transport thereby avoiding the use of additional charge transport layers. Furthermore, a facile cathode deposition method based on transfer of a molten alloy (Ga:In) on top of the active layer is deployed, thus avoiding high vacuum thermal deposition which adds versatile assets to our approach. We combine ambipolar charge transport organic complex design and a simple ambient cathode deposition to achieve a potentially cost effective red to NIR emitting device with outstanding performance, opening new avenues towards the development of simplified light emitting sources through device optimization.",Klebsiella pneumoniae prevents spore germination and hyphal development of Aspergillus species.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659217,Scientific reports,2019 01 24,"Different bacteria and fungi live as commensal organisms as part of the human microbiota, but shifts to a pathogenic state potentially leading to septic infections commonly occur in immunocompromised individuals. Several studies have reported synergistic or antagonistic interactions between individual bacteria and fungi which might be of clinical relevance. Here, we present first evidence for the interaction between Klebsiella pneumoniae and several Aspergillus species including A. fumigatus, A. terreus, A. niger and A. flavus which cohabit in the lungs and the intestines. Microbiological and molecular methods were employed to investigate the interaction in vitro, and the results indicate that Klebsiella pneumoniae is able to prevent Aspergillus spp. spore germination and hyphal development. The inhibitory effect is reversible, as demonstrated by growth recovery of Aspergillus spp. upon inhibition or elimination of the bacteria, and is apparently dependent on the physical interaction with metabolically active bacteria. Molecular analysis of Klebsiella-Aspergillus interaction has shown upregulation of Aspergillus cell wall-related genes and downregulation of hyphae-related genes, suggesting that Klebsiella induces cell wall stress response mechanisms and suppresses filamentous growth. Characterization of polymicrobial interactions may provide the basis for improved clinical management of mixed infections by setting the stage for appropriate diagnostics and ultimately for optimized treatment strategies.",Claudin-3-deficient C57BL/6J mice display intact brain barriers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659216,Scientific reports,2019 01 23,"The tight junction protein claudin-3 has been identified as a transcriptional target of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway regulating blood-brain barrier (BBB) maturation. In neurological disorders loss of claudin-3 immunostaining is observed at the compromised BBB and blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier (BCSFB). Although these observations support a central role of claudin-3 in regulating brain barriers' tight junction integrity, expression of claudin-3 at the brain barriers has remained a matter of debate. This prompted us to establish claudin-3-/- C57BL/6J mice to study the role of claudin-3 in brain barrier integrity in health and neuroinflammation. Bulk and single cell RNA sequencing and direct comparative qRT-PCR analysis of brain microvascular samples from WT and claudin-3-/- mice show beyond doubt that brain endothelial cells do not express claudin-3 mRNA. Detection of claudin-3 protein at the BBB in vivo and in vitro is rather due to junctional reactivity of anti-claudin-3 antibodies to an unknown antigen still detected in claudin-3-/- brain endothelium. We confirm expression and junctional localization of claudin-3 at the BCSFB of the choroid plexus. Our study clarifies that claudin-3 is not expressed at the BBB and shows that absence of claudin-3 does not impair brain barrier function during health and neuroinflammation in C57BL/6J mice.",Hemispheric Regional Based Analysis of Diffusion Tensor Imaging and Diffusion Tensor Tractography in Patients with Temporal Lobe Epilepsy and Correlation with Patient outcomes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659215,Scientific reports,2019 01 24,"Imaging in the field of epilepsy surgery remains an essential tool in terms of its ability to identify regions where the seizure focus might present as a resectable area. However, in many instances, an obvious structural abnormality is not visualized. This has created the opportunity for new approaches and imaging innovation in the field of epilepsy, such as with Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) and Diffusion Tensor Tractography (DTT). In this study, we aim to evaluate the use of DTI and DTT as a predictive model in the field of epilepsy, specifically Temporal Lobe Epilepsy (TLE), and correlate their clinical significance with respect to postsurgical outcomes. A hemispheric based analysis was used to compare the tract density, as well as DTI indices of the specific regions of interest from the pathologic hemisphere to the healthy hemisphere in TLE patients. A total of 22 patients with TLE (12 males, 10 females, 22-57 age range) underwent either a craniotomy, Anterior Temporal Lobectomy (ATL), or a less invasive method of Selective Laser Amygdalohippocampectomy (SLAH) and were imaged using 3.0 T Philips Achieva MR scanner. Of the participants, 12 underwent SLAH while 10 underwent ATL. The study was approved by the institutional review board of Thomas Jefferson University Hospital. Informed consent was obtained from all patients. All patients had a diagnosis of TLE according to standard clinical criteria. DTI images were acquired axially in the same anatomical location prescribed for the T1-weighted images. The raw data set consisting of diffusion volumes were first corrected for eddy current distortions and motion artifacts. Various DTI indices such as Fractional Anisotropy (FA), Mean Diffusivity (MD), Radial Diffusivity (RD) and Axial Diffusivity (AD) were estimated and co-registered to the brain parcellation map obtained by freesurfer. 16 consolidated cortical and subcortical regions were selected as regions of interest (ROIs) by a functional neurosurgeon and DTI values for each ROI were calculated and compared with the corresponding ROI in the opposite hemisphere. Also, track density imaging (TDI) of 68 white matter parcels were generated using fiber orientation distribution (FOD) based deterministic fiber tracking and compared with contralateral side of the brain in each epileptic group: left mesial temporal sclerosis (LMTS) and right MTS (RMTS)). In patients with LMTS, MD and RD values of the left hippocampus decreased significantly using two-tailed t-test (p = 0.03 and p = 0.01 respectively) compared to the right hippocampus. Also, RD showed a marginally significant decrease in left amygdala (p = 0.05). DTT analysis in LMTS shows a marginally significant decrease in the left white matter supramarginal parcel (p = 0.05). In patients with RMTS, FA showed a significant decrease in the ipsilateral mesial temporal lobe (p = 0.02), parahippocampal area (p = 0.03) and thalamus (p = 0.006). RD showed a marginally significant increase in the ipsilateral hippocampus (p = 0.05) and a significant increase in the ipsilateral parahippocampal area (p = 0.03). Also, tract density of the ipsilateral white matter inferior parietal parcel showed a marginally significant increase compared to the contralateral side (p = 0.05). With respect to postsurgical outcomes, we found an association between residual seizures and tract density in five white matter segments including ipsilateral lingual (p = 0.04), ipsilateral temporal pole (p = 0.007), ipsilateral pars opercularis (p = 0.03), ipsilateral inferior parietal (p = 0.04) and contralateral frontal pole (p = 0.04). These results may have the potential to be developed into imaging prognostic markers of postoperative outcomes and provide new insights for why some patients with TLE continue to experience postoperative seizures if pathological/clinical correlates are further confirmed.",Dissecting Heterosis During the Ear Inflorescence Development Stage in Maize via a Metabolomics-based Analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659214,Scientific reports,2019 01 24,"Heterosis can increase the yield of many crops and has been extensively applied in agriculture. In maize, female inflorescence architecture directly determines grain yield. Thus, exploring the relationship between early maize ear inflorescence development and heterosis regarding yield-related traits may be helpful for characterizing the molecular mechanisms underlying heterotic performance. In this study, we fine mapped the overdominant heterotic locus (hlEW2b), associated with ear width, in an approximately 1.98-Mb region based on analyses of chromosome segment substitution lines and the corresponding testcross population. Maize ear inflorescences at the floral meristem stage were collected from two inbred lines, one chromosome segment substitution line that carried hlEW2b (sub-CSSL16), the receptor parent lx9801, and the Zheng58 × sub-CSSL16 and Zheng58 × lx9801 hybrid lines. A total of 256 metabolites were identified, including 31 and 24 metabolites that were differentially accumulated between the two hybrid lines and between the two inbred lines, respectively. Most of these metabolites are involved in complex regulatory mechanisms important for maize ear development. For example, nucleotides are basic metabolites affecting cell composition and carbohydrate synthesis. Additionally, nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism is important for photosynthesis, plant stress responses, and cell expansion. Moreover, flavonoid and phenolic metabolites regulate auxin transport and cell apoptosis. Meanwhile, phytohormone biosynthesis and distribution influence the cell cycle and cell proliferation. Our results revealed that changes in metabolite contents may affect the heterotic performance related to ear width and yield in maize hybrid lines. This study provides new clues in heterosis at the metabolomics level and implies that differentially accumulated metabolites made distinct contributions to the heterosis at an early stage of ear inflorescences development.",Temporal trends and inequalities in coronary angiography utilization in the management of non-ST-Elevation acute coronary syndromes in the U.S.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659213,Scientific reports,2019 01 24,"Coronary angiography (CA) is the basis of an invasive management strategy in non-ST elevation acute coronary syndromes (NSTEACS). There are limited contemporary data on national temporal trends in utilization of CA in different patient subgroups. We sought to investigate temporal trends, predictors and clinical outcomes associated with the use of CA in the US. Using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) from 2004-2014, we identified all inpatient admissions, age ≥18, with a primary diagnosis of NSTEACS. Descriptive statistics and multivariable logistic regression models were used to investigate temporal trends, predictors and clinical outcomes associated with CA. From a total of 4,380,827 patients, 57.5% received CA during the study period and were more likely to be male, younger and less comorbid as defined per Charlson comorbidity index. The proportion of patients receiving CA increased from 48.5% to 68.5%, however, higher proportional increase was observed in males (53.9% to 69.4% Ptrend < 0.001) and those age ≤60 years (59.0% to 77.9% Ptrend < 0.001). Prior history of CABG (OR 0.33 95%CI 0.35-0.36), previous PCI (OR 0.84 95%CI 0.83-0.86) and previous AMI (OR 0.65 95%CI 0.64-0.67) were inversely related with receipt of CA. Receipt of CA was strongly associated with decreased odds of in-hospital mortality (OR 0.38 95%CI 0.36-0.40). In this national analysis, we observed a temporal increase in utilization of CA albeit slower adoption was noted in older, women and more comorbid patients. The risk-treatment paradox wherein patients who are most likely to benefit were less likely to receive CA persists even in contemporary practice."

They bind to the Glucocorticoid Receptor (GR), which acts as a transcription factor. The activation of metabolic genes by GR is thought to underlie these adverse effects. We identify the bHLH factor E47 as a modulator of GR target genes. Using mouse genetics, we find that E47 is required for the regulation of hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism by GR, and that loss of E47 prevents the development of hyperglycemia and hepatic steatosis in response to GCs. Here we show that E47 and GR co-occupy metabolic promoters and enhancers. E47 is needed for the efficient recruitment of GR and coregulators such as Mediator to chromatin. Altogether, our results illustrate how GR and E47 regulate hepatic metabolism, and might provide an entry point for novel therapies with reduced side effects.",Earthquake lubrication and healing explained by amorphous nanosilica.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659201,Nature communications,2019 01 29,"During earthquake propagation, geologic faults lose their strength, then strengthen as slip slows and stops. Many slip-weakening mechanisms are active in the upper-mid crust, but healing is not always well-explained. Here we show that the distinct structure and rate-dependent properties of amorphous nanopowder (not silica gel) formed by grinding of quartz can cause extreme strength loss at high slip rates. We propose a weakening and related strengthening mechanism that may act throughout the quartz-bearing continental crust. The action of two slip rate-dependent mechanisms offers a plausible explanation for the observed weakening: thermally-enhanced plasticity, and particulate flow aided by hydrodynamic lubrication. Rapid cooling of the particles causes rapid strengthening, and inter-particle bonds form at longer timescales. The timescales of these two processes correspond to the timescales of post-seismic healing observed in earthquakes. In natural faults, this nanopowder crystallizes to quartz over 10s-100s years, leaving veins which may be indistinguishable from common quartz veins.",An evolutionarily-conserved Wnt3/β-catenin/Sp5 feedback loop restricts head organizer activity in Hydra.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659200,Nature communications,2019 02 15,"Polyps of the cnidarian Hydra maintain their adult anatomy through two developmental organizers, the head organizer located apically and the foot organizer basally. The head organizer is made of two antagonistic cross-reacting components, an activator, driving apical differentiation and an inhibitor, preventing ectopic head formation. Here we characterize the head inhibitor by comparing planarian genes down-regulated when β-catenin is silenced to Hydra genes displaying a graded apical-to-basal expression and an up-regulation during head regeneration. We identify Sp5 as a transcription factor that fulfills the head inhibitor properties: leading to a robust multiheaded phenotype when knocked-down in Hydra, acting as a transcriptional repressor of Wnt3 and positively regulated by Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Hydra and zebrafish Sp5 repress Wnt3 promoter activity while Hydra Sp5 also activates its own expression, likely via β-catenin/TCF interaction. This work identifies Sp5 as a potent feedback loop inhibitor of Wnt/β-catenin signaling, a function conserved across eumetazoan evolution.",Proteo-Transcriptomic Dynamics of Cellular Response to HIV-1 Infection.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659199,Scientific reports,2019 01 23,"Throughout the HIV-1 replication cycle, complex host-pathogen interactions take place in the infected cell, leading to the production of new virions. The virus modulates the host cellular machinery in order to support its life cycle, while counteracting intracellular defense mechanisms. We investigated the dynamic host response to HIV-1 infection by systematically measuring transcriptomic, proteomic, and phosphoproteomic expression changes in infected and uninfected SupT1 CD4+ T cells at five time points of the viral replication process. By means of a Gaussian mixed-effects model implemented in the new R/Bioconductor package TMixClust, we clustered host genes based on their temporal expression patterns. We identified a proteo-transcriptomic gene expression signature of 388 host genes specific for HIV-1 replication. Comprehensive functional analyses of these genes confirmed the previously described roles of some of the genes and revealed novel key virus-host interactions affecting multiple molecular processes within the host cell, including signal transduction, metabolism, cell cycle, and immune system. The results of our analysis are accessible through a freely available, dedicated and user-friendly R/Shiny application, called PEACHi2.0. This resource constitutes a catalogue of dynamic host responses to HIV-1 infection that provides a basis for a more comprehensive understanding of virus-host interactions.",Cross-lineage protection by human antibodies binding the influenza B hemagglutinin.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659197,Nature communications,2019 02 15,"Influenza B viruses (IBV) drive a significant proportion of influenza-related hospitalisations yet are understudied compared to influenza A. Current vaccines target the head of the viral hemagglutinin (HA) which undergoes rapid mutation, significantly reducing vaccine effectiveness. Improved vaccines to control IBV are needed. Here we developed novel IBV HA probes to interrogate humoral responses to IBV in humans. A significant proportion of IBV HA-specific B cells recognise both B/Victoria/2/87-like and B/Yamagata/16/88-like lineages in a distinct pattern of cross-reactivity. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were reconstituted from IBV HA-specific B cells, including mAbs providing broad protection in murine models of lethal IBV infection. Protection was mediated by neutralising antibodies targeting the receptor binding domain, or via Fc-mediated functions of non-neutralising antibodies binding alternative epitopes including the IBV HA stem. This work defines antigenic cross-recognition between IBV lineages and provides guidance for the rational design of improved IBV vaccines for broad and durable protection.",Author Correction: Task-dependent representations of stimulus and choice in mouse parietal cortex.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659196,Nature communications,2019 01 29,"In the original version of this Article, the Acknowledgements section was inadvertently omitted.

Here, our affinity- and bisulfite-based whole-genome sequencing analyses reveal global enhancer hypomethylation in human HCCs. Integrative epigenomic characterization further pinpoints a recurrent hypomethylated enhancer of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-beta (C/EBPβ) which correlates with C/EBPβ over-expression and poorer prognosis of patients. Demethylation of C/EBPβ enhancer reactivates a self-reinforcing enhancer-target loop via direct transcriptional up-regulation of enhancer RNA. Conversely, deletion of this enhancer via CRISPR/Cas9 reduces C/EBPβ expression and its genome-wide co-occupancy with BRD4 at H3K27ac-marked enhancers and super-enhancers, leading to drastic suppression of driver oncogenes and HCC tumorigenicity. Hepatitis B X protein transgenic mouse model of HCC recapitulates this paradigm, as C/ebpβ enhancer hypomethylation associates with oncogenic activation in early tumorigenesis. These results support a causal link between aberrant enhancer hypomethylation and C/EBPβ over-expression, thereby contributing to hepatocarcinogenesis through global transcriptional reprogramming.",Author Correction: Single human B cell-derived monoclonal anti-Candida antibodies enhance phagocytosis and protect against disseminated candidiasis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659194,Nature communications,2019 01 29,The original version of this Article contained errors in the author affiliations.

Most earlier studies modelled patients undergoing treatment, entailing confounding with drug effects on brain activity, and making them less applicable to real-world diagnosis at the point of first medical contact. Further, most studies with classification accuracies >80% are based on small sample datasets, which may be insufficient to capture the heterogeneity of schizophrenia, limiting generalization to unseen cases. In this study, we used RS fMRI data collected from a cohort of antipsychotic drug treatment-naive patients meeting DSM IV criteria for schizophrenia (N = 81) as well as age- and sex-matched healthy controls (N = 93). We present an ensemble model -- EMPaSchiz (read as 'Emphasis'; standing for 'Ensemble algorithm with Multiple Parcellations for Schizophrenia prediction') that stacks predictions from several 'single-source' models, each based on features of regional activity and functional connectivity, over a range of different a priori parcellation schemes. EMPaSchiz yielded a classification accuracy of 87% (vs. chance accuracy of 53%), which out-performs earlier machine learning models built for diagnosing schizophrenia using RS fMRI measures modelled on large samples (N > 100). To our knowledge, EMPaSchiz is first to be reported that has been trained and validated exclusively on data from drug-naive patients diagnosed with schizophrenia. The method relies on a single modality of MRI acquisition and can be readily scaled-up without needing to rebuild parcellation maps from incoming training images.",Combining LOPIT with differential ultracentrifugation for high-resolution spatial proteomics.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659192,Nature communications,2019 02 15,"The study of protein localisation has greatly benefited from high-throughput methods utilising cellular fractionation and proteomic profiling. Hyperplexed Localisation of Organelle Proteins by Isotope Tagging (hyperLOPIT) is a well-established method in this area. It achieves high-resolution separation of organelles and subcellular compartments but is relatively time- and resource-intensive. As a simpler alternative, we here develop Localisation of Organelle Proteins by Isotope Tagging after Differential ultraCentrifugation (LOPIT-DC) and compare this method to the density gradient-based hyperLOPIT approach. We confirm that high-resolution maps can be obtained using differential centrifugation down to the suborganellar and protein complex level. HyperLOPIT and LOPIT-DC yield highly similar results, facilitating the identification of isoform-specific localisations and high-confidence localisation assignment for proteins in suborganellar structures, protein complexes and signalling pathways. By combining both approaches, we present a comprehensive high-resolution dataset of human protein localisations and deliver a flexible set of protocols for subcellular proteomics."

In this study, we characterize gut-associated bacteria in their ability to decarboxylate levodopa to dopamine via tyrosine decarboxylases. Bacterial tyrosine decarboxylases efficiently convert levodopa to dopamine, even in the presence of tyrosine, a competitive substrate, or inhibitors of human decarboxylase. In situ levels of levodopa are compromised by high abundance of gut bacterial tyrosine decarboxylase in patients with Parkinson's disease. Finally, the higher relative abundance of bacterial tyrosine decarboxylases at the site of levodopa absorption, proximal small intestine, had a significant impact on levels of levodopa in the plasma of rats. Our results highlight the role of microbial metabolism in drug availability, and specifically, that abundance of bacterial tyrosine decarboxylase in the proximal small intestine can explain the increased dosage regimen of levodopa treatment in Parkinson's disease patients.",LEADeR role of miR-205 host gene as long noncoding RNA in prostate basal cell differentiation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659180,Nature communications,2019 02 15,"Though miR-205 function has been largely characterized, the nature of its host gene, MIR205HG, is still completely unknown. Here, we show that only lowly expressed alternatively spliced MIR205HG transcripts act as de facto pri-miRNAs, through a process that involves Drosha to prevent unfavorable splicing and directly mediate miR-205 excision. Notably, MIR205HG-specific processed transcripts revealed to be functional per se as nuclear long noncoding RNA capable of regulating differentiation of human prostate basal cells through control of the interferon pathway. At molecular level, MIR205HG directly binds the promoters of its target genes, which have an Alu element in proximity of the Interferon-Regulatory Factor (IRF) binding site, and represses their transcription likely buffering IRF1 activity, with the ultimate effect of preventing luminal differentiation. As MIR205HG functions autonomously from (albeit complementing) miR-205 in preserving the basal identity of prostate epithelial cells, it warrants reannotation as LEADeR (Long Epithelial Alu-interacting Differentiation-related RNA).",Dual-barcoded shotgun expression library sequencing for high-throughput characterization of functional traits in bacteria.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659179,Nature communications,2019 02 15,"A major challenge in genomics is the knowledge gap between sequence and its encoded function.

As a demonstration of this approach, we construct a Dub-seq library with Escherichia coli genomic DNA, performed 155 genome-wide fitness assays in 52 experimental conditions, and identified overexpression phenotypes for 813 genes. We show that Dub-seq data is reproducible, accurately recapitulates known biology, and identifies hundreds of novel gain-of-function phenotypes for E. coli genes, a subset of which we verified with assays of individual strains.

Here we show that single genetic variants and genetic scores composed of multiple variants are associated with birth location within UK Biobank and that geographic structure in genotype data cannot be accounted for using routine adjustment for study centre and principal components derived from genotype data. We find that major health outcomes appear geographically structured and that coincident structure in health outcomes and genotype data can yield biased associations.

However, the lack of continuous, multi-year direct observations as well as limitations of climate and ice shelf models prevent a precise assessment on how the ocean forcing affects the fluctuations of a grounded and floating ice cap. Here we show that a +0.3-1.5 °C increase in subsurface ocean temperature (50-400 m) in the northeastern Antarctic Peninsula has driven to major collapse and recession of the regional ice shelf during both the instrumental period and the last 9000 years. Our projections following the representative concentration pathway 8.5 emission scenario from the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reveal a +0.3 °C subsurface ocean temperature warming within the coming decades that will undoubtedly accelerate ice shelf melting, including the southernmost sector of the eastern Antarctic Peninsula.",Differential damage and repair of DNA-adducts induced by anti-cancer drug cisplatin across mouse organs.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659176,Nature communications,2019 02 15,"The platinum-based drug cisplatin is a widely used first-line therapy for several cancers. Cisplatin interacts with DNA mainly in the form of Pt-d(GpG) di-adduct, which stalls cell proliferation and activates DNA damage response. Although cisplatin shows a broad spectrum of anticancer activity, its utility is limited due to acquired drug resistance and toxicity to non-targeted tissues. Here, by integrating genome-wide high-throughput Damage-seq, XR-seq, and RNA-seq approaches, along with publicly available epigenomic data, we systematically study the genome-wide profiles of cisplatin damage formation and excision repair in mouse kidney, liver, lung and spleen. We find different DNA damage and repair spectra across mouse organs, which are associated with tissue-specific transcriptomic and epigenomic profiles. The framework and the multi-omics data we present here constitute an unbiased foundation for understanding the mechanisms of cellular response to cisplatin.

Here, we found that activation of hypothalamic Agrp neurons rapidly altered whole-body substrate utilization, increasing carbohydrate utilization, while decreasing fat utilization. These metabolic changes occurred even in the absence of caloric ingestion and were coupled to increased lipogenesis. Accordingly, inhibition of fatty acid synthase-a key enzyme that mediates lipogenesis-blunted the effects of Agrp neuron activation on substrate utilization. In pair-fed conditions during positive energy balance, activation of Agrp neurons improved metabolic efficiency, and increased weight gain and adiposity. Conversely, ablation of Agrp neurons impaired fat mass accumulation. These results suggest Agrp neurons regulate substrate utilization, contributing to lipogenesis and fat mass accumulation during positive energy balance.",Electron correlation driven non-adiabatic relaxation in molecules excited by an ultrashort extreme ultraviolet pulse.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659172,Nature communications,2019 01 30,"The many-body quantum nature of molecules determines their static and dynamic properties, but remains the main obstacle in their accurate description. Ultrashort extreme ultraviolet pulses offer a means to reveal molecular dynamics at ultrashort timescales. Here, we report the use of time-resolved electron-momentum imaging combined with extreme ultraviolet attosecond pulses to study highly excited organic molecules. We measure relaxation timescales that increase with the state energy. High-level quantum calculations show these dynamics are intrinsic to the time-dependent many-body molecular wavefunction, in which multi-electronic and non-Born-Oppenheimer effects are fully entangled. Hints of coherent vibronic dynamics, which persist despite the molecular complexity and high-energy excitation, are also observed. These results offer opportunities to understand the molecular dynamics of highly excited species involved in radiation damage and astrochemistry, and the role of quantum mechanical effects in these contexts.",Child sexual offenders show prenatal and epigenetic alterations of the androgen system.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659171,Translational psychiatry,2019 06 13,"Child sexual offending (CSO) places a serious burden on society and medicine and pedophilia (P) is considered a major risk factor for CSO. The androgen system is closely linked to sexual development and behavior. This study assessed markers of prenatal brain androgenization, genetic parameters of androgen receptor function, epigenetic regulation, and peripheral hormones in a 2 × 2 factorial design comprising the factors Offense (yes/no) and Pedophilia (yes/no) in analyzing blood samples from 194 subjects (57 P+CSO, 45 P-CSO, 20 CSO-P, and 72 controls) matched for age and intelligence. Subjects also received a comprehensive clinical screening. Independent of their sexual preference, child sexual offenders showed signs of elevated prenatal androgen exposure compared with non-offending pedophiles and controls. The methylation status of the androgen receptor gene was also higher in child sexual offenders, indicating lower functionality of the testosterone system, accompanied by lower peripheral testosterone levels. In addition, there was an interaction effect on methylation levels between offense status and androgen receptor functionality. Notably, markers of prenatal androgenization and the methylation status of the androgen receptor gene were correlated with the total number of sexual offenses committed. This study demonstrates alterations of the androgen system on a prenatal, epigenetic, and endocrine level. None of the major findings was specific for pedophilia, but they were for CSO. The findings support theories of testosterone-linked abnormalities in early brain development in delinquent behavior and suggest possible interactions of testosterone receptor gene methylation and plasma testosterone with environmental factors."

This can be due to tumour cells escaping the immune response and creating an immunosuppressive microenvironment enhancing cancer progression. Immunotherapy has become a promising tool for cancer treatment as it restores the anti-tumour response of the patient's immune system. Immune checkpoint inhibitors are the most widely studied immunotherapies worldwide and are now approved for multiple cancers. However, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy has also shown promise by targeting T lymphocytes that are genetically modified ex vivo to express CARs and this is now approved to treat some haematological cancers. Although immunotherapy has shown successful treatment outcomes in multiple cancers, some patients do not respond to this treatment. Therefore, approaches to enhance the efficacy of immunotherapies are likely to be the key to improve their effectiveness. Therefore, combination therapies of checkpoint inhibitors +/- chemotherapy are at the forefront of current research. Furthermore, biomarkers that predict treatment response are now beginning to emerge. Additionally, utilising nanoparticles as a newly targeted drug delivery system to enhance CAR-T cell therapy may enhance the efficacy of the cells when re-infused within the patient. Even if efficacy is enhanced, severe immune-related adverse events (irAEs) occur that are life-threatening and could lead to therapy being stopped. Therefore, predictive biomarkers for toxicity are also needed to improve both the patient's quality of life and treatment outcomes. This review will look at the current immunotherapies in clinical trials and discuss how to enhance their efficacy.",Structural basis for substrate binding and specificity of a sodium-alanine symporter AgcS.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659158,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2019 04 16,"The amino acid, polyamine, and organocation (APC) superfamily is the second largest superfamily of membrane proteins forming secondary transporters that move a range of organic molecules across the cell membrane. Each transporter in the APC superfamily is specific for a unique subset of substrates, even if they possess a similar structural fold. The mechanism of substrate selectivity remains, by and large, elusive. Here, we report two crystal structures of an APC member from Methanococcus maripaludis, the alanine or glycine:cation symporter (AgcS), with l- or d-alanine bound. Structural analysis combined with site-directed mutagenesis and functional studies inform on substrate binding, specificity, and modulation of the AgcS family and reveal key structural features that allow this transporter to accommodate glycine and alanine while excluding all other amino acids. Mutation of key residues in the substrate binding site expand the selectivity to include valine and leucine. These studies provide initial insights into substrate selectivity in AgcS symporters.",Effects of rapid evolution on species coexistence.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659157,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2019 04 16,"Increasing evidence for rapid evolution suggests that the maintenance of species diversity in ecological communities may be influenced by more than purely ecological processes. Classic theory shows that interspecific competition may select for traits that increase niche differentiation, weakening competition and thus promoting species coexistence. While empirical work has demonstrated trait evolution in response to competition, if and how evolution affects the dynamics of the competing species-the key step for completing the required eco-evolutionary feedback-has been difficult to resolve. Here, we show that evolution in response to interspecific competition feeds back to change the course of competitive population dynamics of aquatic plant species over 10-15 generations in the field. By manipulating selection imposed by heterospecific competitors in experimental ponds, we demonstrate that (i) interspecific competition drives rapid genotypic change, and (ii) this evolutionary change in one competitor, while not changing the coexistence outcome, causes the population trajectories of the two competing species to converge. In contrast to the common expectation that interspecific competition should drive the evolution of niche differentiation, our results suggest that genotypic evolution resulted in phenotypic changes that altered population dynamics by affecting the competitive hierarchy. This result is consistent with theory suggesting that competition for essential resources can limit opportunities for the evolution of niche differentiation. Our finding that rapid evolution regulates the dynamics of competing species suggests that ecosystems may rely on continuous feedbacks between ecology and evolution to maintain species diversity.",Nonequilibrium correlations in minimal dynamical models of polymer copying.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659156,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2019 04 04,"Living systems produce ""persistent"" copies of information-carrying polymers, in which template and copy sequences remain correlated after physically decoupling. We identify a general measure of the thermodynamic efficiency with which these nonequilibrium states are created and analyze the accuracy and efficiency of a family of dynamical models that produce persistent copies. For the weakest chemical driving, when polymer growth occurs in equilibrium, both the copy accuracy and, more surprisingly, the efficiency vanish. At higher driving strengths, accuracy and efficiency both increase, with efficiency showing one or more peaks at moderate driving. Correlations generated within the copy sequence, as well as between template and copy, store additional free energy in the copied polymer and limit the single-site accuracy for a given chemical work input. Our results provide insight into the design of natural self-replicating systems and can aid the design of synthetic replicators.",Losartan treatment enhances chemotherapy efficacy and reduces ascites in ovarian cancer models by normalizing the tumor stroma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659155,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2019 04 16,"In ovarian cancer patients, tumor fibrosis and angiotensin-driven fibrogenic signaling have been shown to inversely correlate with survival. We sought to enhance drug delivery and therapeutic efficacy by remodeling the dense extracellular matrix in two orthotopic human ovarian carcinoma xenograft models. We hypothesized that targeting the angiotensin signaling axis with losartan, an approved angiotensin system inhibitor, could reduce extracellular matrix content and the associated ""solid stress,"" leading to better anticancer therapeutic effect. We report here four translatable findings: (i) losartan treatment enhances the efficacy of paclitaxel-a drug used for ovarian cancer treatment-via normalizing the tumor microenvironment, resulting in improved vessel perfusion and drug delivery; (ii) losartan depletes matrix via inducing antifibrotic miRNAs that should be tested as candidate biomarkers of response or resistance to chemotherapy; (iii) although losartan therapy alone does not reduce tumor burden, it reduces both the incidence and the amount of ascites formed; and (iv) our retrospective analysis revealed that patients receiving angiotensin system inhibitors concurrently with standard treatment for ovarian cancer exhibited 30 mo longer overall survival compared with patients on other antihypertensives. Our findings provide the rationale and supporting data for a clinical trial on combined losartan and chemotherapy in ovarian cancer patients.",Chromatin features constrain structural variation across evolutionary timescales.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659153,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2019 04 16,"The potential impact of structural variants includes not only the duplication or deletion of coding sequences, but also the perturbation of noncoding DNA regulatory elements and structural chromatin features, including topological domains (TADs). Structural variants disrupting TAD boundaries have been implicated both in cancer and developmental disease; this likely occurs via ""enhancer hijacking,"" whereby removal of the TAD boundary exposes enhancers to new target transcription start sites (TSSs). With this functional role, we hypothesized that boundaries would display evidence for negative selection. Here we demonstrate that the chromatin landscape constrains structural variation both within healthy humans and across primate evolution. In contrast, in patients with developmental delay, variants occur remarkably uniformly across genomic features, suggesting a potentially broad role for enhancer hijacking in human disease.",Soluble matrix protein is a potent modulator of mesenchymal stem cell performance.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659152,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2019 04 12,"We challenge the conventional designation of structural matrix proteins primarily as supporting scaffolds for resident cells. The extracellular matrix protein tropoelastin is classically regarded as a structural component that confers mechanical strength and resilience to tissues subject to repetitive elastic deformation. Here we describe how tropoelastin inherently induces a range of biological responses, even in cells not typically associated with elastic tissues and in a manner unexpected of typical substrate-dependent matrix proteins. We show that tropoelastin alone drives mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) proliferation and phenotypic maintenance, akin to the synergistic effects of potent growth factors such as insulin-like growth factor 1 and basic fibroblast growth factor. In addition, tropoelastin functionally surpasses these growth factors, as well as fibronectin, in allowing substantial media serum reduction without loss of proliferative potential. We further demonstrate that tropoelastin elicits strong mitogenic and cell-attractive responses, both as an immobilized substrate and as a soluble additive, via direct interactions with cell surface integrins αvβ3 and αvβ5. This duality of action converges the long-held mechanistic dichotomy between adhesive matrix proteins and soluble growth factors and uncovers the powerful, untapped potential of tropoelastin for clinical MSC expansion and therapeutic MSC recruitment. We propose that the potent, growth factor-like mitogenic and motogenic abilities of tropoelastin are biologically rooted in the need for rapid stem cell homing and proliferation during early development and/or wound repair.",Standing genetic variation as the predominant source for adaptation of a songbird.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659151,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2019 04 16,"What kind of genetic variation contributes the most to adaptation is a fundamental question in evolutionary biology. By resequencing genomes of 80 individuals, we inferred the origin of genomic variants associated with a complex adaptive syndrome involving multiple quantitative traits, namely, adaptation between high and low altitudes, in the vinous-throated parrotbill (Sinosuthora webbiana) in Taiwan. By comparing these variants with those in the Asian mainland population, we revealed standing variation in 24 noncoding genomic regions to be the predominant genetic source of adaptation. Parrotbills at both high and low altitudes exhibited signatures of recent selection, suggesting that not only the front but also the trailing edges of postglacial expanding populations could be subjected to environmental stresses. This study verifies and quantifies the importance of standing variation in adaptation in a cohort of genes, illustrating that the evolutionary potential of a population depends significantly on its preexisting genetic diversity. These findings provide important context for understanding adaptation and conservation of species in the Anthropocene.",Illuminating spatial A-to-I RNA editing signatures within the Drosophila brain.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659150,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2019 04 16,"Adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing, catalyzed by ADAR enzymes, is a ubiquitous mechanism that generates transcriptomic diversity. This process is particularly important for proper neuronal function; however, little is known about how RNA editing is dynamically regulated between the many functionally distinct neuronal populations of the brain. Here, we present a spatial RNA editing map in the Drosophila brain and show that different neuronal populations possess distinct RNA editing signatures. After purifying and sequencing RNA from genetically marked groups of neuronal nuclei, we identified a large number of editing sites and compared editing levels in hundreds of transcripts across nine functionally different neuronal populations. We found distinct editing repertoires for each population, including sites in repeat regions of the transcriptome and differential editing in highly conserved and likely functional regions of transcripts that encode essential neuronal genes. These changes are site-specific and not driven by changes in Adar expression, suggesting a complex, targeted regulation of editing levels in key transcripts. This fine-tuning of the transcriptome between different neurons by RNA editing may account for functional differences between distinct populations in the brain.",Motile cilia of the male reproductive system require miR-34/miR-449 for development and function to generate luminal turbulence.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659149,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2019 05 14,"Cilia are cell-surface, microtubule-based organelles that project into extracellular space. Motile cilia are conserved throughout eukaryotes, and their beat induces the flow of fluid, relative to cell surfaces. In mammals, the coordinated beat of motile cilia provides highly specialized functions associated with the movement of luminal contents, as seen with metachronal waves transporting mucus in the respiratory tract. Motile cilia are also present in the male and female reproductive tracts. In the female, wave-like motions of oviductal cilia transport oocytes and embryos toward the uterus. A similar function has been assumed for motile cilia in efferent ductules of the male-i.e., to transport immotile sperm from rete testis into the epididymis. However, we report here that efferent ductal cilia in the male do not display a uniform wave-like beat to transport sperm solely in one direction, but rather exert a centripetal force on luminal fluids through whip-like beating with continual changes in direction, generating turbulence, which maintains immotile spermatozoa in suspension within the lumen. Genetic ablation of two miRNA clusters (miR-34b/c and -449a/b/c) led to failure in multiciliogenesis in murine efferent ductules due to dysregulation of numerous genes, and this mouse model allowed us to demonstrate that loss of efferent duct motile cilia causes sperm aggregation and agglutination, luminal obstruction, and sperm granulomas, which, in turn, induce back-pressure atrophy of the testis and ultimately male infertility."

Immunotherapy is emerging as a novel therapeutic approach in this disease for which the causative agent, human papillomavirus (HPV), has dynamic, complex immunomodulatory effects. This review explores the biologic rational of immuno-oncology in the treatment of CC and discusses the initial clinical efficacy, ongoing clinical trials, and rationale for combined multimodal treatment approaches for locally advanced and recurrent/metastatic CC. The utility of immune checkpoint inhibitors is explored, including anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4), PD-1, and PD-L1.

Recently, a large randomized phase III trial, the Laparoscopic Approach to Cervical Cancer (LACC) trial, showed that MIS for ESCC is associated with a higher risk of recurrence and death compared with open surgery. We review the LACC trial findings in depth, as well as a recent National Cancer Database analysis using propensity score weighting that supports the LACC trial findings. Additional studies are needed to better understand the mechanisms explaining the worse survival associated with MIS for ESCC. This review discusses considerations for integrating the findings of the LACC trial into clinical practice.

Exercise interventions using digital activity trackers (E-DATs) may improve exercise adherence, but data are limited for patients with cancer. We conducted a systematic review examining the feasibility of E-DATs in cancer survivors and effects on activity level, body composition, objective fitness outcomes, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), self-reported symptoms, and biomarkers. Methods: We identified randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of E-DATs in adult cancer survivors published in English between January 1, 2008, and July 27, 2017. Two authors independently reviewed article titles (n=160), removed duplicates (n=50), and reviewed the remaining 110 articles for eligibility. Results: A total of 12 RCTs met eligibility criteria, including 1,450 patients (mean age, 50-70 years) with the following cancers: breast (n=5), colon or breast (n=2), prostate (n=1), acute leukemia (n=1), or others (n=3). Duration of E-DATs ranged from 4 to 24 weeks, and the follow-up period ranged from 4 to 52 weeks, with retention rates of 54% to 95%. The technology component of E-DATs included pedometers (n=8); pedometers with smartphone application (n=1), Wii Fit (n=1), heart rate monitor (n=1); and a wireless sensor with accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer (n=1). Adherence by at least one measure to E-DATs was >70% in 8 of 8 RCTs. Compared with controls, E-DATs significantly improved patients' step count in 3 of 5 RCTs, activity level in 6 of 9 RCTs, and HRQoL in 7 of 9 RCTs (all P≤05), with no significant changes in biomarkers (eg, interleukin 6, tumor necrosis factor α, C-reactive protein, c-peptide, lipid panel) in 3 RCTs. Duration of E-DAT was not significantly correlated with adherence or study retention. Conclusions: This systematic review shows that E-DATs are feasible to implement in cancer survivors. Future research should examine the optimal type, dose, and schedule of E-DATs for cancer survivors.",Real-World Outcomes of Adjuvant Chemotherapy for Node-Negative and Node-Positive HER2-Positive Breast Cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659129,Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network : JNCCN,2019 06 03,"Background: Comparative real-world outcomes for patients with HER2-positive (HER2+) breast cancer receiving adjuvant trastuzumab outside of clinical trials are lacking. This study sought to retrospectively characterize outcomes for patients with node-negative and node-positive breast cancer receiving adjuvant trastuzumab in combination with docetaxel/cyclophosphamide (DCH), docetaxel/carboplatin/trastuzumab (TCH), or fluorouracil/epirubicin/cyclophosphamide followed by docetaxel/trastuzumab (FEC-DH) chemotherapy in Alberta, Canada, from 2007 through 2014. Methods: Disease-free survival and overall survival (OS) analyses for node-negative cohorts receiving DCH (n=111) or TCH (n=371) and node-positive cohorts receiving FEC-DH (n=146) or TCH (n=315) were compared using chi-square, Kaplan-Meier, or Cox multivariable analysis where appropriate. Results: Median follow-up was similar in node-negative (63.9 months) and node-positive (69.0 months) cohorts. The 5-year OS rates in patients with node-negative disease receiving DCH or TCH were similar (95.2% vs 96.9%; P=.268), whereas 5-year OS rates were higher but nonsignificant for patients with node-positive disease treated with FEC-DH compared with TCH (95.2% vs 91.4%; P=.160). Subgroup analysis of node-positive cohorts showed significantly improved OS with FEC-DH versus TCH in patients with estrogen receptor (ER)/progesterone receptor (PR)-positive breast cancer (98.3% vs 91.6%, respectively; P=.014). Conversely, patients with ER/PR-negative disease showed a nonsignificant trend toward higher OS rates with TCH versus FEC-DH (91.6% vs 83.3%, respectively; P=.298). Given the retrospective design, we were unable to capture all potential covariates that may have impacted treatment assignment and/or outcomes. Furthermore, cardiac toxicity data were unavailable. Conclusions: Survival rates of patients with HER2+ breast cancer in our study are comparable to those seen in clinical trials. Our findings support chemotherapy de-escalation in patients with node-negative disease and validate the efficacy of FEC-DH in those with node-positive disease.",Incorporating Tumor Characteristics to Maximize 21-Gene Assay Utility: A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659128,Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network : JNCCN,2019 03 04,"Background: Literature suggests that Oncotype DX (ODX) is cost-effective. These studies, however, tend to ignore clinical characteristics and have not incorporated population-based data regarding the distribution of ODX results across different clinical risk groups. Accordingly, this study assessed the cost-effectiveness of ODX across strata of clinical risk groups using population-based ODX data. Methods: We created state-transition models to calculate costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained over the lifetime for women with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive, HER2-negative, lymph node-negative breast cancer from a US payer perspective. Using the Connecticut Tumor Registry, we classified the 2,245 patients diagnosed in 2011 through 2013 into 3 clinical risk groups according to the PREDICT model, a risk calculator developed by the National Health Service in the United Kingdom. Within each risk group, we then determined the recurrence score (RS) distributions (<18, 18-30, and ≥31). Other input parameters were derived from the literature. Uncertainty was assessed using deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Results: Approximately 82.5%, 11.9%, and 5.6% of our sample were in the PREDICT low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups, respectively. When combining these 3 groups, ODX had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $62,200 per QALY for patients aged 60 years. The ICERs, however, differed across clinical risk groups, ranging from $124,600 per QALY in the low-risk group, to $28,700 per QALY in the intermediate-risk group, to $15,700 per QALY in the high-risk group. Results were sensitive to patient age: the ICER for patients aged 45 to 75 years ranged from $77,100 to $344,600 per QALY in the PREDICT low-risk group, and was lower than $100,000 per QALY in the intermediate- and high-risk groups. Conclusions: ODX is not cost-effective for women with clinical low-risk breast cancer, which constitutes most patients with ER-positive disease.",Definitive Pelvic Radiotherapy and Survival of Patients With Newly Diagnosed Metastatic Anal Cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659127,Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network : JNCCN,2019 03 04,"Background: Chemotherapy with or without pelvic radiotherapy (RT) is included in the NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines) for metastatic anal cancer (MAC), despite limited clinical evidence for RT in this setting. In addition, increasing evidence shows that local therapies, including RT, may increase patient survival for some types of metastatic cancers. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the patterns of care and association between definitive pelvic RT and overall survival (OS) for patients with MAC. Methods: The National Cancer Database was analyzed to evaluate OS of patients with newly diagnosed MAC treated with chemotherapy with or without pelvic RT. Those who did not undergo treatment, treated with surgery, or without baseline variables were excluded. OS was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method, log-rank test, Cox proportional hazards models, and propensity score-matched analyses. Results: From 2004 through 2015, 437 patients received chemotherapy alone and 1,020 received pelvic chemoradiotherapy (CRT). At a median follow-up of 17.3 months, CRT was associated with improved OS on univariate (P<.001) and multivariate analysis (hazard ratio [HR], 0.70; 95% CI, 0.61-0.81; P<.001). Propensity score-matched analysis demonstrated superior median survival (21.3 vs 15.9 months) and 2-year OS rates (46% vs 34%) with CRT compared with chemotherapy alone (P<.001). Landmark analyses limited to long-term survivors of ≥1, ≥2, and ≥4 years showed improved OS with CRT in all subsets (all P<.05). CRT with therapeutic doses (≥45 Gy) was associated with longer median survival than palliative doses (<45 Gy) and chemotherapy alone (24.9 vs 10.9 vs 15.6 months, respectively; P<.001). The benefit of CRT was present among not only those with distant lymph node metastasis (HR, 0.63; P=.04) but also those with distant organ disease (HR, 0.74; P<.001). Conclusions: In this large hypothesis-generating analysis, patients with newly diagnosed MAC who received definitive pelvic RT with chemotherapy lived significantly longer than those who received chemotherapy alone. Prospective trials evaluating definitive local RT for MAC are warranted.",Use of Bisphosphonates in Elderly Patients With Newly Diagnosed Multiple Myeloma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659126,Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network : JNCCN,2019 06 14,"Background: Bisphosphonates reduce skeletal-related events (SREs) in patients with multiple myeloma (MM) and, in some studies, improved survival. Since 2011, bisphosphonate use has been recommended by NCCN for all patients with newly diagnosed MM receiving antineoplastic therapy independent of the presence of bone disease. This study investigated their use after these guidelines were established. Methods: We identified patients aged ≥65 years in the SEER-Medicare database with newly diagnosed MM between January 1, 2012, and December 31, 2013, who received antineoplastic therapy, had ≥6 months of follow-up, and did not receive prior bisphosphonates. Presence of SREs at diagnosis was identified, including pathologic fracture, spinal cord compression, radiation to bone, or surgery to bone. Use of bisphosphonates was defined as having ≥1 claim for an intravenous or oral bisphosphonate within 6 months after the start of antineoplastic therapy. We used multivariable modeling to compare users with nonusers, controlling for demographic and clinical covariates. We compared overall survival between users and nonusers using proportional hazards analysis. Results: Of 1,309 patients identified, 720 (55%) used a bisphosphonate. Factors associated with use included SRE at diagnosis (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 2.60; 95% CI, 1.98-3.40), hypercalcemia (AOR, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.26-2.41), and use of proteasome inhibitor + immunomodulatory imide therapy (AOR, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.21-2.39). Chronic kidney disease (AOR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.35-0.66) was associated with decreased use. Bisphosphonate use was associated with reduced mortality (hazard ratio, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.56-0.88). Conclusions: Although bisphosphonate use is recommended for all patients with newly diagnosed MM receiving antineoplastic therapy, 45% of patients in the United States did not receive this guideline-recommended care.","NCCN Guidelines Insights: Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia/Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma, Version 2.2019.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659125,Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network : JNCCN,2019 06 03,"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is generally characterized by an indolent disease course.

In this study, we examined a novel mechanism of intercellular communication, namely membranous actin-based tunneling nanotubes (TNTs), that occurs between macrophages and tumor cells in the promotion of macrophage-dependent tumor cell invasion. The presence of heterotypic TNTs between macrophages and tumor cells induced invasive tumor cell morphology, which was dependent on EGF-EGFR signaling. Furthermore, reduction of a protein involved in TNT formation, M-Sec (TNFAIP2), in macrophages inhibited tumor cell elongation, blocked the ability of tumor cells to invade in 3D and reduced macrophage-dependent long-distance tumor cell streaming in vitro Using an in vivo zebrafish model that recreates macrophage-mediated tumor cell invasion, we observed TNT-mediated macrophage-dependent tumor cell invasion, distant metastatic foci and areas of metastatic spread. Overall, our studies support a role for TNTs as a novel means of interaction between tumor cells and macrophages that leads to tumor progression and metastasis.",A global analysis of IFT-A function reveals specialization for transport of membrane-associated proteins into cilia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659111,Journal of cell science,2019 02 28,"Intraflagellar transport (IFT), which is essential for the formation and function of cilia in most organisms, is the trafficking of IFT trains (i.e. assemblies of IFT particles) that carry cargo within the cilium. Defects in IFT cause several human diseases. IFT trains contain the complexes IFT-A and IFT-B. To dissect the functions of these complexes, we studied a Chlamydomonas mutant that is null for the IFT-A protein IFT140. The mutation had no effect on IFT-B but destabilized IFT-A, preventing flagella assembly. Therefore, IFT-A assembly requires IFT140. Truncated IFT140, which lacks the N-terminal WD repeats of the protein, partially rescued IFT and supported formation of half-length flagella that contained normal levels of IFT-B but greatly reduced amounts of IFT-A. The axonemes of these flagella had normal ultrastructure and, as investigated by SDS-PAGE, normal composition. However, composition of the flagellar 'membrane+matrix' was abnormal. Analysis of the latter fraction by mass spectrometry revealed decreases in small GTPases, lipid-anchored proteins and cell signaling proteins. Thus, IFT-A is specialized for the import of membrane-associated proteins. Abnormal levels of the latter are likely to account for the multiple phenotypes of patients with defects in IFT140.This article has an associated First Person interview with the first author of the paper.",Constitutive IP3R1-mediated Ca2+ release reduces Ca2+ store content and stimulates mitochondrial metabolism in mouse GV oocytes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659110,Journal of cell science,2019 02 28,"In mammals, fertilization initiates Ca2+ oscillations in metaphase II oocytes, which are required for the activation of embryo development. Germinal vesicle (GV) oocytes also display Ca2+ oscillations, although these unfold spontaneously in the absence of any known agonist(s) and their function remains unclear. We found that the main intracellular store of Ca2+ in GV oocytes, the endoplasmic reticulum ([Ca2+]ER), constitutively 'leaks' Ca2+ through the type 1 inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor. The [Ca2+]ER leak ceases around the resumption of meiosis, the GV breakdown (GVBD) stage, which coincides with the first noticeable accumulation of Ca2+ in the stores. It also concurs with downregulation of the Ca2+ influx and termination of the oscillations, which seemed underpinned by the inactivation of the putative plasma membrane Ca2+ channels. Lastly, we demonstrate that mitochondria take up Ca2+ during the Ca2+ oscillations, mounting their own oscillations that stimulate the mitochondrial redox state and increase the ATP levels of GV oocytes. These distinct features of Ca2+ homeostasis in GV oocytes are likely to underpin the acquisition of both maturation and developmental competence, as well as fulfill stage-specific cellular functions during oocyte maturation.",The Autoimmune Susceptibility Gene C5orf30 Regulates Macrophage-Mediated Resolution of Inflammation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659109,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2019 02 16,"Genetic variants in C5orf30 have been associated with development of the autoimmune conditions primary biliary cirrhosis and rheumatoid arthritis. In rheumatoid arthritis, C5orf30 expression is cell-specific, with highest expression found in macrophages and synovial fibroblasts. C5orf30 is highly expressed in inflamed joints and is a negative regulator of tissue damage in a mouse model of inflammatory arthritis. Transcriptomic analysis from ultrasound-guided synovial biopsy of inflamed joints in a well characterized clinical cohort of newly diagnosed, disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs-naive rheumatoid arthritis patients was used to determine the clinical association of C5orf30 expression with disease activity. A combined molecular and computational biology approach was used to elucidate C5orf30 function in macrophages both in vitro and in vivo. Synovial expression of C5orf30 is inversely correlated with both clinical measures of rheumatoid arthritis disease activity and with synovial TNF mRNA expression. C5orf30 plays a role in regulating macrophage phenotype and is differentially turned over in inflammatory and anti-inflammatory macrophages. Inhibition of C5orf30 reduces wound healing/repair-associated functions of macrophages, reduces signaling required for resolution of inflammation, and decreases secretion of anti-inflammatory mediators. In an animal model of wound healing (zebrafish), C5orf30 inhibition increases the recruitment of macrophages to the wound site. Finally, we demonstrate that C5orf30 skews macrophage immunometabolism, demonstrating a mechanism for C5orf30-mediated immune regulation.",Myeloid Slc2a1-Deficient Murine Model Revealed Macrophage Activation and Metabolic Phenotype Are Fueled by GLUT1.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659108,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2019 06 10,"Macrophages (MΦs) are heterogeneous and metabolically flexible, with metabolism strongly affecting immune activation. A classic response to proinflammatory activation is increased flux through glycolysis with a downregulation of oxidative metabolism, whereas alternative activation is primarily oxidative, which begs the question of whether targeting glucose metabolism is a viable approach to control MΦ activation. We created a murine model of myeloid-specific glucose transporter GLUT1 (Slc2a1) deletion. Bone marrow-derived MΦs (BMDM) from Slc2a1M-/- mice failed to uptake glucose and demonstrated reduced glycolysis and pentose phosphate pathway activity. Activated BMDMs displayed elevated metabolism of oleate and glutamine, yet maximal respiratory capacity was blunted in MΦ lacking GLUT1, demonstrating an incomplete metabolic reprogramming. Slc2a1M-/- BMDMs displayed a mixed inflammatory phenotype with reductions of the classically activated pro- and anti-inflammatory markers, yet less oxidative stress. Slc2a1M-/- BMDMs had reduced proinflammatory metabolites, whereas metabolites indicative of alternative activation-such as ornithine and polyamines-were greatly elevated in the absence of GLUT1. Adipose tissue MΦs of lean Slc2a1M-/- mice had increased alternative M2-like activation marker mannose receptor CD206, yet lack of GLUT1 was not a critical mediator in the development of obesity-associated metabolic dysregulation. However, Ldlr-/- mice lacking myeloid GLUT1 developed unstable atherosclerotic lesions. Defective phagocytic capacity in Slc2a1M-/- BMDMs may have contributed to unstable atheroma formation. Together, our findings suggest that although lack of GLUT1 blunted glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway, MΦ were metabolically flexible enough that inflammatory cytokine release was not dramatically regulated, yet phagocytic defects hindered MΦ function in chronic diseases.",LRP1 Controls TNF Release via the TIMP-3/ADAM17 Axis in Endotoxin-Activated Macrophages.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659107,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2019 02 20,"The metalloproteinase ADAM17 plays a pivotal role in initiating inflammation by releasing TNF from its precursor. Prolonged TNF release causes many chronic inflammatory diseases, indicating that tight regulation of ADAM17 activity is essential for resolution of inflammation. In this study, we report that the endogenous ADAM17 inhibitor TIMP-3 inhibits ADAM17 activity only when it is bound to the cell surface and that cell surface levels of TIMP-3 in endotoxin-activated human macrophages are dynamically controlled by the endocytic receptor LRP1. Pharmacological blockade of LRP1 inhibited endocytic clearance of TIMP-3, leading to an increase in cell surface levels of the inhibitor that blocked TNF release. Following LPS stimulation, TIMP-3 levels on the surface of macrophages increased 4-fold within 4 h and continued to accumulate at 6 h, before a return to baseline levels at 8 h. This dynamic regulation of cell surface TIMP-3 levels was independent of changes in TIMP-3 mRNA levels, but correlated with shedding of LRP1. These results shed light on the basic mechanisms that maintain a regulated inflammatory response and ensure its timely resolution.",Memoranda of understanding: a tobacco industry strategy to undermine illicit tobacco trade policies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659106,Tobacco control,2019 01 22,Analyse the transnational tobacco companies' (TTCs) memoranda of understanding (MoUs) on illicit trade and how they could undermine the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) and the Protocol to Eliminate Illicit Trade in Tobacco Products (Protocol).,Illicit tobacco trade in Georgia: prevalence and perceptions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659105,Tobacco control,2019 01 19,"In lower-income and middle-income countries, limited research exists on illicit tobacco trade and its responsiveness to taxation.

Septins are filament-forming, GTP-binding proteins that assemble on positive, micrometer-scale curvatures. Here, we examine the molecular basis of curvature sensing by septins. We show that differences in affinity and the number of binding sites drive curvature-specific adsorption of septins. Moreover, we find septin assembly onto curved membranes is cooperative and show that geometry influences higher-order arrangement of septin filaments. Although septins must form polymers to stay associated with membranes, septin filaments do not have to span micrometers in length to sense curvature, as we find that single-septin complexes have curvature-dependent association rates. We trace this ability to an amphipathic helix (AH) located on the C-terminus of Cdc12. The AH domain is necessary and sufficient for curvature sensing both in vitro and in vivo. These data show that curvature sensing by septins operates at much smaller length scales than the micrometer curvatures being detected."

We used national representative data from 1645 men and 2272 women who participated in the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey in 2015 were included in the analysis. The effects of different types and frequencies of physical activity on HOMA2-IR were investigated using a multiple regression analysis. Compared with no activity, moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) ≥5 times per week (β: -0.214, p≤0.0198) and walking and MVPA ≥5 times per week (β: -0.183, p≤0.0049) were negatively associated with HOMA2-IR. In the subgroup analysis, the strongest effect was observed among overweight men. Additionally, walking plus MVPA ≥5 times per week had the strongest effect on men with a higher-than-recommended daily calorie intake (β: -0.350, p≤0.0030). Therefore, in conclusion, the appropriate type and frequency of physical activity can help reduce HOMA2-IR in South Korean men, especially those who are overweight and/or have a higher-than-recommended daily calorie intake.",The Ventral Midline Thalamus Mediates Hippocampal Spatial Information Processes upon Spatial Cue Changes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659088,The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,2019 04 18,"The ventral midline thalamus, consisting of the reuniens and rhomboid nuclei (RE/Rh), is a thalamic structure interconnected with the limbic systems including the hippocampus. Recently, many studies have revealed that this structure plays distinctive roles in spatial learning and memory in collaboration with hippocampal functions. However, what aspects of spatial information process are influenced by the RE/Rh is not clearly known. To elucidate the roles of RE/Rh in spatial information processing and its effects on hippocampal activity, specifically with the manipulation of spatial contents, we measured hippocampal-dependent spatial memory performance and hippocampal place cell activities after RE/Rh lesion using male C57BL/6J × 129/SvJae hybrid mice. We found that the lesion altered the behavioral aptitude in recognizing locational changes of an object. Furthermore, CA1 place cells in the lesion group showed different spatial representation patterns in recognizing the environment with cue locational changes compared with the control group. Interestingly, the patterns of CA1 place cells in recognizing the same environment previously visited were not disrupted in the lesion group compared with the control group. These findings demonstrate that the ventral midline thalamus (RE/Rh) is important in recognizing the spatial relationships, especially when spatial rearrangement of cue position was introduced.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The ventral midline thalamic nuclei (reuniens and rhomboid) interact with the hippocampus to influence various cognitive functions requiring spatial memories, yet what aspects of spatial information process are influenced by these nuclei is not clearly known. Here, we reveal that these nuclei play a crucial role in modulating hippocampal properties only with locational rearrangement of cues, not with the familiar arrangement. These nuclei are distinctively involved in cue-dependent spatial information processes of CA1 place cells. In particular, we suggest that these nuclei modulate spatial information processing on discrete components, especially when the spatial cue relationship is modified.",Circuit Dysfunction in SOD1-ALS Model First Detected in Sensory Feedback Prior to Motor Neuron Degeneration Is Alleviated by BMP Signaling.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659087,The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,2019 04 19,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease for which the origin and underlying cellular defects are not fully understood. Although motor neuron degeneration is the signature feature of ALS, it is not clear whether motor neurons or other cells of the motor circuit are the site of disease initiation. To better understand the contribution of multiple cell types in ALS, we made use of a Drosophila Sod1G85R knock-in model, in which all cells harbor the disease allele. End-stage dSod1G85R animals of both sexes exhibit severe motor deficits with clear degeneration of motor neurons. Interestingly, earlier in dSod1G85R larvae, motor function is also compromised, but their motor neurons exhibit only subtle morphological and electrophysiological changes that are unlikely to cause the observed decrease in locomotion. We analyzed the intact motor circuit and identified a defect in sensory feedback that likely accounts for the altered motor activity of dSod1G85R We found cell-autonomous activation of bone morphogenetic protein signaling in proprioceptor sensory neurons which are critical for the relay of the contractile status of muscles back to the central nerve cord, completely rescues early-stage motor defects and partially rescue late-stage motor function to extend lifespan. Identification of a defect in sensory feedback as a potential initiating event in ALS motor dysfunction, coupled with the ability of modified proprioceptors to alleviate such motor deficits, underscores the critical role that nonmotor neurons play in disease progression and highlights their potential as a site to identify early-stage ALS biomarkers and for therapeutic intervention.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT At diagnosis, many cellular processes are already disrupted in the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patient. Identifying the initiating cellular events is critical for achieving an earlier diagnosis to slow or prevent disease progression. Our findings indicate that neurons relaying sensory information underlie early stage motor deficits in a Drosophila knock-in model of ALS that best replicates gene dosage in familial ALS (fALS). Importantly, studies on intact motor circuits revealed defects in sensory feedback before evidence of motor neuron degeneration. These findings strengthen our understanding of how neural circuit dysfunctions lead to neurodegeneration and, coupled with our demonstration that the activation of bone morphogenetic protein signaling in proprioceptors alleviates both early and late motor dysfunction, underscores the importance of considering nonmotor neurons as therapeutic targets.",Distinct Neural Mechanisms of Spatial Attention and Expectation Guide Perceptual Inference in a Multisensory World.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659086,The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,2019 04 18,"Spatial attention (i.e., task-relevance) and expectation (i.e., signal probability) are two critical top-down mechanisms guiding perceptual inference. Spatial attention prioritizes processing of information at task-relevant locations. Spatial expectations encode the statistical structure of the environment. An unresolved question is how the brain allocates attention and forms expectations in a multisensory environment, where task-relevance and signal probability over space can differ across sensory modalities. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging in human participants (female and male) to investigate whether the brain encodes task-relevance and signal probability over space separately or interactively across sensory modalities. In a novel multisensory paradigm, we manipulated spatial attention and expectation selectively in audition and assessed their effects on behavioral and neural responses to auditory and visual stimuli. Our results show that both auditory and visual stimuli increased activations in a right-lateralized frontoparietal system, when they were presented at locations that were task-irrelevant in audition. Yet, only auditory stimuli increased activations in the medial prefrontal cortex when presented at expected locations and in audiovisual and frontoparietal cortices signaling a prediction error when presented at unexpected locations. This dissociation in multisensory generalization for attention and expectation effects shows that the brain controls attentional resources interactively across the senses but encodes the statistical structure of the environment as spatial expectations independently for each sensory system. Our results demonstrate that spatial attention and expectation engage partly overlapping neural systems via distinct mechanisms to guide perceptual inference in a multisensory world.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT In our natural environment the brain is exposed to a constant influx of signals through all our senses. How does the brain allocate attention and form spatial expectations in this multisensory environment? Because observers need to respond to stimuli regardless of their sensory modality, they may allocate attentional resources and encode the probability of events jointly across the senses. This psychophysics and neuroimaging study shows that the brain controls attentional resources interactively across the senses via a frontoparietal system but encodes the statistical structure of the environment independently for each sense in sensory and frontoparietal areas. Thus, spatial attention and expectation engage partly overlapping neural systems via distinct mechanisms to guide perceptual inference in a multisensory world.",Energetics and behavior of coral reef fishes during oscillatory swimming in a simulated wave surge.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659085,The Journal of experimental biology,2019 02 28,"Oxygen consumption rates were measured for coral reef fishes during swimming in a bidirectional, oscillatory pattern to simulate station-holding in wave-induced, shallow-water flows. For all species examined, increases in wave intensity, as simulated by increases in frequency and amplitude of oscillation, yielded increased metabolic rates and net costs of swimming (NCOS; swimming metabolic rate minus standard metabolic rate). Comparing species with different swimming modes, the caudal fin swimming Kuhlia spp. (Kuhliidae) and simultaneous pectoral-caudal fin swimming Amphiprion ocellaris (Pomacentridae) turned around to face the direction of swimming most of the time, whereas the median-paired fin (MPF) swimmers, the pectoral fin swimming Ctenochaetus strigosus (Acanthuridae) and dorsal-anal fin swimming Sufflamen bursa (Balistidae), more frequently swam in reverse for one half of the oscillation to avoid turning. Contrary to expectations, the body-caudal fin (BCF) swimming Kuhlia spp. had the lowest overall NCOS in the oscillatory swimming regime compared with the MPF swimmers. However, when examining the effect of increasing frequency of oscillation at similar average velocities, Kuhlia spp. showed a 24% increase in NCOS with a 50% increase in direction changes and accelerations. The two strict MPF swimmers had lower increases on average, suggestive of reduced added costs with increasing frequency of direction changes with this swimming mode. Further studies are needed on the costs of unsteady swimming to determine whether these differences can explain the observed prevalence of fishes using the MPF pectoral fin swimming mode in reef habitats exposed to high, wave-surge-induced water flows.",Parasitic gut infection in Libellula pulchella causes functional and molecular resemblance of dragonfly flight muscle to skeletal muscle of obese vertebrates.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659084,The Journal of experimental biology,2019 03 02,"We previously demonstrated the existence of a naturally occurring metabolic disease phenotype in Libellula pulchella dragonflies that shows high similarity to vertebrate obesity and type II diabetes, and is caused by a protozoan gut parasite. To further mechanistic understanding of how this metabolic disease phenotype affects fitness of male L. pulchella in vivo, we examined infection effects on in situ muscle performance and molecular traits relevant to dragonfly flight performance in nature. Importantly, these traits were previously shown to be affected in obese vertebrates. Similarly to obesity effects in rat skeletal muscle, dragonfly gut infection caused a disruption of relationships between body mass, flight muscle power output and alternative pre-mRNA splicing of troponin T, which affects muscle calcium sensitivity and performance in insects and vertebrates. In addition, when simulated in situ to contract at cycle frequencies ranging from 20 to 45 Hz, flight muscles of infected individuals displayed a left shift in power-cycle frequency curves, indicating a significant reduction in their optimal cycle frequency. Interestingly, these power-cycle curves were similar to those produced by flight muscles of non-infected teneral (i.e. physiologically immature) adult L. pulchella males. Overall, our results indicate that the effects of metabolic disease on skeletal muscle physiology in natural insect systems are similar to those observed in vertebrates maintained in laboratory settings. More generally, they indicate that study of natural, host-parasite interactions can contribute important insight into how environmental factors other than diet and exercise may contribute to the development of metabolic disease phenotypes.",Complementary roles of photoperiod and temperature in environmental sex determination in Daphnia spp.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659083,The Journal of experimental biology,2019 02 19,"Daphnia spp., a keystone genus in freshwater lentic habitats, are subject to environmental sex determination wherein environmental conditions dictate offspring sex and whether they reproduce asexually or sexually. The introduction of males into a population denotes the first step in the switch from asexual parthenogenetic reproduction to sexual reproduction. We tested the hypothesis that photoperiod and temperature co-regulate male sex determination and that these environmental stimuli would activate elements of the male sex determination signaling cascade. The results revealed that photoperiod was a critical cue in creating permissive conditions for male production. Further, under photoperiod-induced permissive conditions, male sex determination was temperature dependent. The two daphnid species evaluated, Daphnia pulex and Daphnia magna, exhibited different temperature dependencies. Daphnia pulex produced fewer males with increasing temperatures between 16 and 22°C, and D. magna exhibited the opposite trend. We found consistent expression patterns of key genes along the male sex-determining signaling pathway in D. pulex independent of environmental stimuli. mRNA levels for the enzyme responsible for synthesis of the male sex-determining hormone, methyl farnesoate, were elevated early in the reproductive cycle, followed by increased mRNA levels of the methyl farnesoate receptor subunits Met and SRC Environmental conditions that stimulated male offspring production significantly increased Met mRNA levels. The results indicate that male sex determination in daphnids is under the permissive control of photoperiod and the regulatory control of temperature. Further, these environmental cues may stimulate male sex determination by increasing levels of the Met subunit of the methyl farnesoate receptor.",Population history with invasive predators predicts innate immune function response to early-life glucocorticoid exposure in lizards.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659082,The Journal of experimental biology,2019 02 16,"Early-life stress can suppress immune function, but it is unclear whether transgenerational stress exposure modulates the immune consequences of early stress. In populations where, historically, the immune system is frequently activated, e.g. persistent stressors that cause injury, it may be maladaptive to suppress immune function after early-life stress. Thus, the relationship between early-life stress and immune function may vary with population-level historical stressor exposure. We collected gravid fence lizards (Sceloporus undulatus) from populations that naturally differ in long-term exposure to invasive fire ants (Solenopsis invicta). We manipulated early-life stress in the resulting offspring via weekly exposure to fire ants, application of the stress-relevant hormone corticosterone or control treatment from 2 to 43 weeks of age. We quantified adult immune function in these offspring with baseline and antigen-induced hemagglutination and plasma bacterial killing ability. Early-life corticosterone exposure suppressed baseline hemagglutination in offspring of lizards from populations not exposed to fire ants but enhanced hemagglutination in those from populations that were exposed to fire ants. This enhancement may prepare lizards for high rates of wounding, toxin exposure and infection associated with fire ant attack. Adult bacterial killing ability and hemagglutination were not affected by early-life exposure to fire ants, but the latter was higher in offspring of lizards from invaded sites. A population's history of persistent stress may thus alter individual long-term immunological responses to early-life stressors. Further consideration of historical stressor exposure (type and duration) may be important to better understand how early-life stressors affect adult physiology.",Encoding phase spectrum for evaluating 'electric qualia'.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659081,The Journal of experimental biology,2019 03 02,"The most broadly expressed and studied aspect of sensory transduction is receptor tuning to the power spectral density of the incoming signals. Temporal cues expressed in the phase spectrum are relevant in African and American pulse-emitting electric fish showing electroreceptors sensing the signals carried by the self- and conspecific-generated electric organ discharges. This article concerns the role of electroreceptor phase sensitivity in American pulse Gymnotiformes. These fish show electroreceptors sharply tuned to narrow frequency bands. This led to the common thought that most electrosensory information is contained in the amplitude spectra of the signals. However, behavioral and modeling studies suggest that in their pulses, Gymnotiformes electroreceptors also encode cues embodied in the phase spectrum of natural stimuli. Here, we show that the two main types of tuberous primary afferents of Gymnotus omarorum differentially respond to cues embodied in the amplitude and phase spectra of self-generated electrosensory signals. One afferent type, pulse markers, is mainly driven by the amplitude spectrum, while the other, burst coders, is predominantly sensitive to the phase spectrum. This dual encoding strategy allows the fish to create a sensory manifold where patterns of 'electric color' generated by object impedance and other potential sources of 'colored' images (such as large nearby objects and other electric fish) can be represented.","Effects of Oral Morphine on Dyspnea in Patients with Cancer: Response Rate, Predictive Factors, and Clinically Meaningful Change (CJLSG1101).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659079,The oncologist,2019 01 19,"Although the efficacy of parenteral morphine for alleviating dyspnea has been previously demonstrated in several studies, little is known regarding the efficacy of oral morphine for dyspnea among patients with cancer, including its response rate and predictive factors of effectiveness.

The isotype/subclass of the antibody, the co-translational N-glycosylation on the CH2 domain, and the remodeling of the N-linked glycans during passage through the ER and Golgi are the known variables within the Fc domain that program antibody effector function. Through investigations of monoclonal therapeutics, it has been observed that addition or removal of specific monosaccharide residues from antibody N-glycans can influence the potency of antibodies, highlighting the importance of thoroughly characterizing antibody N-glycosylation. Although IgGs usually have a single N-glycosylation site and are well studied, other antibody isotypes, e.g. IgA and IgM, that are the first responders in certain diseases, have two to five sites/monomer of antibody, and little is known about their N-glycosylation. Here we employ a nLC-MS/MS method using stepped-energy higher energy collisional dissociation to characterize the N-glycan repertoire and site occupancy of circulating serum antibodies. We simultaneously determined the site-specific N-linked glycan repertoire for IgG1, IgG4, IgA1, IgA2, and IgM in individual healthy donors. Compared with IgG1, IgG4 displayed a higher relative abundance of G1S1F and a lower relative abundance of G1FB. IgA1 and IgA2 displayed mostly biantennary N-glycans. IgA2 variants with the either serine (S93) or proline (P93) were detected. In digests of the sera from a subset of donors, we detected an unmodified peptide containing a proline residue at position 93; this substitution would strongly disfavor N-glycosylation at N92. IgM sites N46, N209, and N272 displayed mostly complex glycans, whereas sites N279 and N439 displayed higher relative abundances of high-mannose glycoforms. This multi-isotype approach is a crucial step toward developing a platform to define disease-specific N-glycan signatures for different isotypes to help tune antibodies to induce protection.

The current structural model for HDL proposes that APOA1 forms an antiparallel dimer in which helix 5 in monomer 1 associates with helix 5 in monomer 2 along a left-left (LL5/5) interface, forming a protein complex with a 2-fold axis of symmetry centered on helix 5. However, computational studies suggest that other orientations are possible. To test this idea, we used a zero-length chemical cross-linking reagent that forms covalent bonds between closely apposed basic and acidic residues. Using proteolytic digestion and tandem mass spectrometry, we identified amino acids in the central region of the antiparallel APOA1 dimer of HDL that were in close contact. As predicted by the current model, we found six intermolecular cross-links that were consistent with the antiparallel LL5/5 registry. However, we also identified three intermolecular cross-links that were consistent with the antiparallel LL5/4 registry. The LL5/5 is the major structural conformation of the two complexes in both reconstituted discoidal HDL particles and in spherical HDL from human plasma. Molecular dynamic simulations suggest that that LL5/5 and LL5/4 APOA1 dimers possess similar free energies of dimerization, with LL5/5 having the lowest free energy. Our observations indicate that phospholipidated APOA1 in HDL forms different antiparallel dimers that could play distinct roles in enzyme regulation, assembly of specific protein complexes, and the functional properties of HDL in humans.",A viral RNA motif involved in signaling the initiation of translation on non-AUG codons.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659060,"RNA (New York, N.Y.)",2019 06 04,"Noncanonical translation, and particularly initiation on non-AUG codons, are frequently used by viral and cellular mRNAs during virus infection and disease. The Sindbis virus (SINV) subgenomic mRNA (sgRNA) constitutes a unique model system to analyze the translation of a capped viral mRNA without the participation of several initiation factors. Moreover, sgRNA can initiate translation even when the AUG initiation codon is replaced by other codons. Using SINV replicons, we examined the efficacy of different codons in place of AUG to direct the synthesis of the SINV capsid protein. The substitution of AUG by CUG was particularly efficient in promoting the incorporation of leucine or methionine in similar percentages at the amino terminus of the capsid protein. Additionally, valine could initiate translation when the AUG is replaced by GUG. The ability of sgRNA to initiate translation on non-AUG codons was dependent on the integrity of a downstream stable hairpin (DSH) structure located in the coding region. The structural requirements of this hairpin to signal the initiation site on the sgRNA were examined in detail. Of interest, a virus bearing CUG in place of AUG in the sgRNA was able to infect cells and synthesize significant amounts of capsid protein. This virus infects the human haploid cell line HAP1 and the double knockout variant that lacks eIF2A and eIF2D. Collectively, these findings indicate that leucine-tRNA or valine-tRNA can participate in the initiation of translation of sgRNA by a mechanism dependent on the DSH. This mechanism does not involve the action of eIF2, eIF2A, or eIF2D.",Prospective Biopsy-Based Study of Chronic Kidney Disease of Unknown Etiology in Sri Lanka.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659059,Clinical journal of the American Society of Nephrology : CJASN,2019 03 29,"A kidney disease of unknown cause is common in Sri Lanka's lowland (dry) region.

Its versatility lies in the capacity to form eight different inter-ubiquitin linkages through the seven lysine residues of ubiquitin and through its N-terminal methionine (M1). The latter, referred to as linear or M1 linkage, is created by the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC), the only E3 ligase known to date that is capable of forming linear ubiquitin chains de novo Linear ubiquitin chains are crucial modulators of innate and adaptive immune responses, and act by regulating inflammatory and cell death signalling. In this Cell Science at a Glance article and the accompanying poster, we review the current knowledge on the role of LUBAC and linear ubiquitination in immune signalling and human physiology. We specifically focus on the role for LUBAC in signalling that is induced by the cytokine tumour necrosis factor (TNF) and its role in inflammation, gene activation and cell death. Furthermore, we highlight the roles of deubiquitinases (DUBs) that cleave M1 linkages and add an additional layer in the control of LUBAC-mediated immune signalling.",Mouse PVRIG Has CD8+ T Cell-Specific Coinhibitory Functions and Dampens Antitumor Immunity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659055,Cancer immunology research,2019 02 02,"A limitation to antitumor immunity is the dysfunction of T cells in the tumor microenvironment, in part due to upregulation of coinhibitory receptors such as PD-1. Here, we describe that poliovirus receptor-related immunoglobulin domain protein (PVRIG) acts as a coinhibitory receptor in mice. Murine PVRIG interacted weakly with poliovirus receptor (PVR) but bound poliovirus receptor-like 2 (PVRL2) strongly, making the latter its principal ligand. As in humans, murine NK and NKT cells constitutively expressed PVRIG. However, when compared with humans, less PVRIG transcript and surface protein was detected in murine CD8+ T cells ex vivo However, activated CD8+ T cells upregulated PVRIG expression. In the mouse tumor microenvironment, infiltrating CD8+ T cells expressed PVRIG whereas its ligand, PVRL2, was detected predominantly on myeloid cells and tumor cells, mirroring the expression pattern in human tumors. PVRIG-deficient mouse CD8+ T cells mounted a stronger antigen-specific effector response compared with wild-type CD8+ T cells during acute Listeria monocytogenes infection. Furthermore, enhanced CD8+ T-cell effector function inhibited tumor growth in PVRIG-/- mice compared with wild-type mice and PD-L1 blockade conferred a synergistic antitumor response in PVRIG-/- mice. Therapeutic intervention with antagonistic anti-PVRIG in combination with anti-PD-L1 reduced tumor growth. Taken together, our results suggest PVRIG is an inducible checkpoint receptor and that targeting PVRIG-PVRL2 interactions results in increased CD8+ T-cell function and reduced tumor growth.See related article on p. 257.",PVRIG and PVRL2 Are Induced in Cancer and Inhibit CD8+ T-cell Function.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659054,Cancer immunology research,2019 02 05,"Although checkpoint inhibitors that block CTLA-4 and PD-1 have improved cancer immunotherapies, targeting additional checkpoint receptors may be required to broaden patient response to immunotherapy. PVRIG is a coinhibitory receptor of the DNAM/TIGIT/CD96 nectin family that binds to PVRL2. We report that antagonism of PVRIG and TIGIT, but not CD96, increased CD8+ T-cell cytokine production and cytotoxic activity. The inhibitory effect of PVRL2 was mediated by PVRIG and not TIGIT, demonstrating that the PVRIG-PVRL2 pathway is a nonredundant signaling node. A combination of PVRIG blockade with TIGIT or PD-1 blockade further increased T-cell activation. In human tumors, PVRIG expression on T cells was increased relative to normal tissue and trended with TIGIT and PD-1 expression. Tumor cells coexpressing PVR and PVRL2 were observed in multiple tumor types, with highest coexpression in endometrial cancers. Tumor cells expressing either PVR or PVRL2 were also present in numbers that varied with the cancer type, with ovarian cancers having the highest percentage of PVR-PVRL2+ tumor cells and colorectal cancers having the highest percentage of PVR+PVRL2- cells. To demonstrate a role of PVRIG and TIGIT on tumor-derived T cells, we examined the effect of PVRIG and TIGIT blockade on human tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. For some donors, blockade of PVRIG increased T-cell function, an effect enhanced by combination with TIGIT or PD-1 blockade. In summary, we demonstrate that PVRIG and PVRL2 are expressed in human cancers and the PVRIG-PVRL2 and TIGIT-PVR pathways are nonredundant inhibitory signaling pathways.See related article on p. 244."

In this review we present reported evidence for the incidence, diagnostic options, therapeutic management, obstetric risks, and neonatal outcome when cancer treatment is initiated during pregnancy. Decision-making when a cancer is diagnosed in a pregnant patient should be multidisciplinary, always taking the patient's perspective into account. Cancer treatment during pregnancy is associated with low birth weight and preterm delivery, therefore frequent obstetric follow-up during oncological treatment in a specialized center is mandatory. Short-term clinical, cardiac, and cognitive outcome of children pre-natally exposed to cancer treatment is overall reassuring. Long-term follow-up of children is warranted to define the possible effect of pre-natal cancer treatment on general health, fertility outcome, and the risk of secondary cancers.",How to perform a laparoscopic pelvic sentinel lymph node dissection using near-infrared fluorescence with indocyanine green in gynecological cancers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659031,International journal of gynecological cancer : official journal of the International Gynecological Cancer Society,2019 01 19,"The role of pelvic sentinel lymph node dissection (SLND) is increasing in oncological pelvic surgery, especially in the management of cervical and endometrial cancer.SLND using indocyanine green (ICG) is safe and effective, and its sensitivity is higher than with other detection methods. The advantages of ICG are its low toxicity, its confinement within the vascular compartment, its rapid excretion, and the rarity of allergic reaction. These advantages confer to this fluorescent dye a superiority over blue, which can cause anaphylactic reactions. Using ICG does not require advance planning involving nuclear protection and delayed surgery, as are mandatory when using 99Tc detection. ICG allows the surgeon to visualize the lymph nodes through the peritoneum and thus avoid wide dissection.According to European guidelines,1 the indications for SLND in cervical cancer are for patients with FIGO (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics) IA1-IA2 disease, lymphovascular space involvement - positive status, without systematic pelvic lymphadenectomy - and patients with FIGO IB1-IIA1 disease, prior to systematic pelvic lymphadenectomy.

Spontaneous gingival bleeding rarely occurs and may be the only sign of systemic bleeding problems such as thrombocytopenia, leukaemia or coagulopathy. In pregnancy, acute onset of thrombocytopenia may occur in systemic disorders such as severe pre-eclampsia, HELLP syndrome (haemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelets) or the acute fatty liver of pregnancy.

Indeed, the dynamic balance of fusion and fission of mitochondria determines their morphology and allows their immediate adaptation to energetic needs as well as preserving their integrity. As a consequence, mitochondrial fusion and fission dynamics and the proteins that control these processes, which are conserved from yeast to human, are essential, and their disturbances are associated with severe human disorders, including neurodegenerative diseases. For example, mutations in OPA1, which encodes a conserved factor essential for mitochondrial fusion, lead to optic atrophy 1, a neurodegeneration that affects the optic nerve, eventually leading to blindness. Here, by screening a collection of ∼1600 repurposed drugs on a fission yeast model, we identified five compounds able to efficiently prevent the lethality associated with the loss of Msp1p, the fission yeast ortholog of OPA1. One compound, hexestrol, was able to rescue both the mitochondrial fragmentation and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) depletion induced by the loss of Msp1p, whereas the second, clomifene, only suppressed the mtDNA defect. Yeast has already been successfully used to identify candidate drugs to treat inherited mitochondrial diseases; this work may therefore provide useful leads for the treatment of optic atrophies such as optic atrophy 1 or Leber hereditary optic neuropathy."

In diphyodonts, the replacement tooth forms on the lingual side of the first tooth from the successional dental lamina. This lamina expresses the stem/progenitor marker Sox2 and has activated Wnt/β-catenin signalling at its tip. Although the mouse does not replace its teeth, a transient rudimentary successional dental lamina (RSDL) still forms during development. The mouse RSDL houses Sox2-positive cells, but no Wnt/β-catenin signalling. Here, we show that stabilising Wnt/β-catenin signalling in the RSDL in the mouse leads to proliferation of the RSDL and formation of lingually positioned teeth. Although Sox2 has been shown to repress Wnt activity, overexpression of Wnts leads to a downregulation of Sox2, suggesting a negative-feedback loop in the tooth. In the mouse, the first tooth represses the formation of the replacement, and isolation of the RSDL is sufficient to induce formation of a new tooth germ. Our data highlight key mechanisms that may have influenced the evolution of replacement teeth.This article has an associated 'The people behind the papers' interview.",Development of Aspirin-Inducible Biosensors in Escherichia coli and SimCells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30658983,Applied and environmental microbiology,2019 04 14,"A simple aspirin-inducible system has been developed and characterized in Escherichia coli by employing the Psal promoter and SalR regulation system originally from Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1. Mutagenesis at the DNA binding domain (DBD) and chemical recognition domain (CRD) of the SalR protein in A. baylyi ADP1 suggests that the effector-free form, SalRr, can compete with the effector-bound form, SalRa, binding the Psal promoter and repressing gene transcription. The induction of the Psal promoter was compared in two different gene circuit designs: a simple regulation system (SRS) and positive autoregulation (PAR). Both regulatory circuits were induced in a dose-dependent manner in the presence of 0.05 to 10 µM aspirin. Overexpression of SalR in the SRS circuit reduced both baseline leakiness and the strength of the Psal promoter. The PAR circuit forms a positive feedback loop that fine-tunes the level of SalR. A mathematical simulation based on the SalRr/SalRa competitive binding model not only fit the observed experimental results in SRS and PAR circuits but also predicted the performance of a new gene circuit design for which weak expression of SalR in the SRS circuit should significantly improve induction strength. The experimental result is in good agreement with this prediction, validating the SalRr/SalRa competitive binding model. The aspirin-inducible systems were also functional in probiotic strain E. coli Nissle 1917 and SimCells produced from E. coli MC1000 ΔminD These well-characterized and modularized aspirin-inducible gene circuits would be useful biobricks for synthetic biology.IMPORTANCE An aspirin-inducible SalR/Psal regulation system, originally from Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1, has been designed for E. coli strains. SalR is a typical LysR-type transcriptional regulator (LTTR) family protein and activates the Psal promoter in the presence of aspirin or salicylate in the range of 0.05 to 10 µM. The experimental results and mathematical simulations support the competitive binding model of the SalR/Psal regulation system in which SalRr competes with SalRa to bind the Psal promoter and affect gene transcription. The competitive binding model successfully predicted that weak SalR expression would significantly improve the inducible strength of the SalR/Psal regulation system, which is confirmed by the experimental results. This provides an important mechanism model to fine-tune transcriptional regulation of the LTTR family, which is the largest family of transcriptional regulators in the prokaryotic kingdom. In addition, the SalR/Psal regulation system was also functional in probiotic strain E. coli Nissle 1917 and minicell-derived SimCells, which would be a useful biobrick for environmental and medical applications.",Resilience and Assemblage of Soil Microbiome in Response to Chemical Contamination Combined with Plant Growth.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30658982,Applied and environmental microbiology,2019 04 14,"A lack of knowledge of the microbial responses to environmental change at the species and functional levels hinders our ability to understand the intrinsic mechanisms underlying the maintenance of microbial ecosystems. Here, we present results from temporal microcosms that introduced inorganic and organic contaminants into agro-soils for 90 days, with three common legume plants. Temporal dynamics and assemblage of soil microbial communities and functions in response to contamination under the influence of growth of different plants were explored via sequencing of the 16S rRNA amplicon and by shotgun metagenomics. Soil microbial alpha diversity and structure at the taxonomic and functional levels exhibited resilience patterns. Functional profiles showed greater resilience than did taxonomic ones. Different legume plants imposed stronger selection on taxonomic profiles than on functional ones. Network and random forest analyses revealed that the functional potential of soil microbial communities was fostered by various taxonomic groups. Betaproteobacteria were important predictors of key functional traits such as amino acid metabolism, nucleic acid metabolism, and hydrocarbon degradation. Our study reveals the strong resilience of the soil microbiome to chemical contamination and sensitive responses of taxonomic rather than functional profiles to selection processes induced by different legume plants. This is pivotal to develop approaches and policies for the protection of soil microbial diversity and functions in agro-ecosystems with different response strategies from global environmental drivers, such as soil contamination and plant invasion.IMPORTANCE Exploring the microbial responses to environmental disturbances is a central issue in microbial ecology. Understanding the dynamic responses of soil microbial communities to chemical contamination and the microbe-soil-plant interactions is essential for forecasting the long-term changes in soil ecosystems. Nevertheless, few studies have applied multi-omics approaches to assess the microbial responses to soil contamination and the microbe-soil-plant interactions at the taxonomic and functional levels simultaneously. Our study reveals clear succession and resilience patterns of soil microbial diversity and structure in response to chemical contamination. Different legume plants exerted stronger selection processes on taxonomic than on functional profiles in contaminated soils, which could benefit plant growth and fitness as well as foster the potential abilities of hydrocarbon degradation and metal tolerance. These results provide new insight into the resilience and assemblage of soil microbiome in response to environmental disturbances in agro-ecosystems at the species and functional levels.","Sucrose Metabolism in Haloarchaea: Reassessment Using Genomics, Proteomics, and Metagenomics.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30658981,Applied and environmental microbiology,2019 04 14,"The canonical pathway for sucrose metabolism in haloarchaea utilizes a modified Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway (EMP), in which ketohexokinase and 1-phosphofructokinase phosphorylate fructose released from sucrose hydrolysis. However, our survey of haloarchaeal genomes determined that ketohexokinase and 1-phosphofructokinase genes were not present in all species known to utilize fructose and sucrose, thereby indicating that alternative mechanisms exist for fructose metabolism. A fructokinase gene was identified in the majority of fructose- and sucrose-utilizing species, whereas only a small number possessed a ketohexokinase gene. Analysis of a range of hypersaline metagenomes revealed that haloarchaeal fructokinase genes were far more abundant (37 times) than haloarchaeal ketohexokinase genes. We used proteomic analysis of Halohasta litchfieldiae (which encodes fructokinase) and identified changes in protein abundance that relate to growth on sucrose. Proteins inferred to be involved in sucrose metabolism included fructokinase, a carbohydrate primary transporter, a putative sucrose hydrolase, and two uncharacterized carbohydrate-related proteins encoded in the same gene cluster as fructokinase and the transporter. Homologs of these proteins were present in the genomes of all haloarchaea that use sugars for growth. Enzymes involved in the semiphosphorylative Entner-Doudoroff pathway also had higher abundances in sucrose-grown H. litchfieldiae cells, consistent with this pathway functioning in the catabolism of the glucose moiety of sucrose. The study revises the current understanding of fundamental pathways for sugar utilization in haloarchaea and proposes alternatives to the modified EMP pathway used by haloarchaea for sucrose and fructose utilization.IMPORTANCE Our ability to infer the function that microorganisms perform in the environment is predicated on assumptions about metabolic capacity. When genomic or metagenomic data are used, metabolic capacity is inferred from genetic potential. Here, we investigate the pathways by which haloarchaea utilize sucrose. The canonical haloarchaeal pathway for fructose metabolism involving ketohexokinase occurs only in a small proportion of haloarchaeal genomes and is underrepresented in metagenomes. Instead, fructokinase genes are present in the majority of genomes/metagenomes. In addition to genomic and metagenomic analyses, we used proteomic analysis of Halohasta litchfieldiae (which encodes fructokinase but lacks ketohexokinase) and identified changes in protein abundance that related to growth on sucrose. In this way, we identified novel proteins implicated in sucrose metabolism in haloarchaea, comprising a transporter and various catabolic enzymes (including proteins that are annotated as hypothetical).",Insights into the Function of the N-Acetyltransferase SatA That Detoxifies Streptothricin in Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus anthracis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30658980,Applied and environmental microbiology,2019 04 14,"Acylation of epsilon amino groups of lysyl side chains is a widespread modification of proteins and small molecules in cells of all three domains of life. Recently, we showed that Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus anthracis encode the GCN5-related N-acetyltransferase (GNAT) SatA that can acetylate and inactivate streptothricin, which is a broad-spectrum antibiotic produced by actinomycetes in the soil. To determine functionally relevant residues of B. subtilis SatA (BsSatA), a mutational screen was performed, highlighting the importance of a conserved area near the C terminus. Upon inspection of the crystal structure of the B. anthracis Ames SatA (BaSatA; PDB entry 3PP9), this area appears to form a pocket with multiple conserved aromatic residues; we hypothesized this region contains the streptothricin-binding site. Chemical and site-directed mutagenesis was used to introduce missense mutations into satA, and the functionality of the variants was assessed using a heterologous host (Salmonella enterica). Results of isothermal titration calorimetry experiments showed that residue Y164 of BaSatA was important for binding streptothricin. Results of size exclusion chromatography analyses showed that residue D160 was important for dimerization. Together, these data advance our understanding of how SatA interacts with streptothricin.IMPORTANCE This work provides insights into how an abundant antibiotic found in soil is bound to the enzyme that inactivates it. This work identifies residues for the binding of the antibiotic and probes the contributions of substituting side chains for those in the native protein, providing information regarding hydrophobicity, size, and flexibility of the antibiotic binding site.",Proteogenomics Reveals Novel Reductive Dehalogenases and Methyltransferases Expressed during Anaerobic Dichloromethane Metabolism.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30658979,Applied and environmental microbiology,2019 04 14,"Dichloromethane (DCM) is susceptible to microbial degradation under anoxic conditions and is metabolized via the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway; however, mechanistic understanding of carbon-chlorine bond cleavage is lacking. The microbial consortium RM contains the DCM degrader ""Candidatus Dichloromethanomonas elyunquensis"" strain RM, which strictly requires DCM as a growth substrate. Proteomic workflows applied to DCM-grown consortium RM biomass revealed a total of 1,705 nonredundant proteins, 521 of which could be assigned to strain RM. In the presence of DCM, strain RM expressed a complete set of Wood-Ljungdahl pathway enzymes, as well as proteins implicated in chemotaxis, motility, sporulation, and vitamin/cofactor synthesis. Four corrinoid-dependent methyltransferases were among the most abundant proteins. Notably, two of three putative reductive dehalogenases (RDases) encoded within strain RM's genome were also detected in high abundance. Expressed RDase 1 and RDase 2 shared 30% amino acid identity, and RDase 1 was most similar to an RDase of Dehalococcoides mccartyi strain WBC-2 (AOV99960, 52% amino acid identity), while RDase 2 was most similar to an RDase of Dehalobacter sp. strain UNSWDHB (EQB22800, 72% amino acid identity). Although the involvement of RDases in anaerobic DCM metabolism has yet to be experimentally verified, the proteome characterization results implicated the possible participation of one or more reductive dechlorination steps and methyl group transfer reactions, leading to a revised proposal for an anaerobic DCM degradation pathway.IMPORTANCE Naturally produced and anthropogenically released DCM can reside in anoxic environments, yet little is known about the diversity of organisms, enzymes, and mechanisms involved in carbon-chlorine bond cleavage in the absence of oxygen. A proteogenomic approach identified two RDases and four corrinoid-dependent methyltransferases expressed by the DCM degrader ""Candidatus Dichloromethanomonas elyunquensis"" strain RM, suggesting that reductive dechlorination and methyl group transfer play roles in anaerobic DCM degradation. These findings suggest that the characterized DCM-degrading bacterium Dehalobacterium formicoaceticum and ""Candidatus Dichloromethanomonas elyunquensis"" strain RM utilize distinct strategies for carbon-chlorine bond cleavage, indicating that multiple pathways evolved for anaerobic DCM metabolism. The specific proteins (e.g., RDases and methyltransferases) identified in strain RM may have value as biomarkers for monitoring anaerobic DCM degradation in natural and contaminated environments.",Large-Scale Analysis of Flavobacterium psychrophilum Multilocus Sequence Typing Genotypes Recovered from North American Salmonids Indicates that both Newly Identified and Recurrent Clonal Complexes Are Associated with Disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30658978,Applied and environmental microbiology,2019 04 14,"Flavobacterium psychrophilum, the etiological agent of bacterial coldwater disease (BCWD) and rainbow trout fry syndrome (RTFS), causes significant economic losses in salmonid aquaculture, particularly in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). Prior studies have used multilocus sequence typing (MLST) to examine genetic heterogeneity within F. psychrophilum At present, however, its population structure in North America is incompletely understood, as only 107 isolates have been genotyped. Herein, MLST was used to investigate the genetic diversity of an additional 314 North American F. psychrophilum isolates that were recovered from ten fish host species from 20 U.S. states and 1 Canadian province over nearly four decades. These isolates were placed into 66 sequence types (STs), 47 of which were novel, increasing the number of clonal complexes (CCs) in North America from 7 to 12. Newly identified CCs were diverse in terms of host association, distribution, and association with disease. The largest F. psychrophilum CC identified was CC-ST10, within which 10 novel genotypes were discovered, most of which came from O. mykiss experiencing BCWD. This discovery, among others, provides evidence for the hypothesis that ST10 (i.e., the founding ST of CC-ST10) originated in North America. Furthermore, ST275 (in CC-ST10) was recovered from wild/feral adult steelhead and marks the first recovery of CC-ST10 from wild/feral fish in North America. Analyses also revealed that at the allele level, the diversification of F. psychrophilum in North America is driven three times more frequently by recombination than random nucleic acid mutation, possibly indicating how new phenotypes emerge within this species.IMPORTANCEFlavobacterium psychrophilum is the causative agent of bacterial coldwater disease (BCWD) and rainbow trout fry syndrome (RTFS), both of which cause substantial losses in farmed fish populations worldwide. To better prevent and control BCWD and RTFS outbreaks, we sought to characterize the genetic diversity of several hundred F. psychrophilum isolates that were recovered from diseased fish across North America. Results highlighted multiple F. psychrophilum genetic strains that appear to play an important role in disease events in North American aquaculture facilities and suggest that the practice of trading fish eggs has led to the continental and transcontinental spread of this bacterium. The knowledge generated herein will be invaluable toward guiding the development of future disease prevention techniques.",Population Genomics Insights into Adaptive Evolution and Ecological Differentiation in Streptomycetes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30658977,Applied and environmental microbiology,2019 03 23,"Deciphering the genomic variation that represents microevolutionary processes toward species divergence is key to understanding microbial speciation, which has long been under debate. Streptomycetes are filamentous bacteria that are ubiquitous in nature and the richest source of antibiotics; however, their speciation processes remain unknown. To tackle this issue, we performed a comprehensive population genomics analysis on Streptomyces albidoflavus residing in different habitats and with a worldwide distribution and identified and characterized the foundational changes within the species. We detected three well-defined phylogenomic clades, of which clades I and III mainly contained free-living (soil/marine) and insect-associated strains, respectively, and clade II had a mixed origin. By performing genome-wide association studies (GWAS), we identified a number of genetic variants associated with free-living or entomic (denoting or relating to insects) habitats in both the accessory and core genomes. These variants contributed collectively to the population structure and had annotated or confirmed functions that likely facilitate differential adaptation of the species. In addition, we detected higher levels of homologous recombination within each clade and in the free-living group than within the whole species and in the entomic group. A subset of the insect-associated strains (clade III) showed a relatively independent evolutionary trajectory with more symbiosis-favorable genes but little genetic interchange with the other lineages. Our results demonstrate that ecological adaptation promotes genetic differentiation in S. albidoflavus, suggesting a model of ecological speciation with gene flow in streptomycetes.IMPORTANCE Species are the fundamental units of ecology and evolution, and speciation leads to the astounding diversity of life on Earth. Studying speciation is thus of great significance to understand, protect, and exploit biodiversity, but it is a challenge in the microbial world. In this study, using population genomics, we placed Streptomyces albidoflavus strains in a spectrum of speciation and showed that the genetic differences between phylogenomic clusters evolved mainly by environmental selection and gene-specific sweeps. These findings highlight the role of ecology in structuring recombining bacterial species, making a step toward a deeper understanding of microbial speciation. Our results also raise concerns of an underrated microbial diversity at the intraspecies level, which can be utilized for mining of ecologically relevant natural products.","Molecular Hydrogen, a Neglected Key Driver of Soil Biogeochemical Processes.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30658976,Applied and environmental microbiology,2019 04 14,"The atmosphere of the early Earth is hypothesized to have been rich in reducing gases such as hydrogen (H2). H2 has been proposed as the first electron donor leading to ATP synthesis due to its ubiquity throughout the biosphere as well as its ability to easily diffuse through microbial cells and its low activation energy requirement. Even today, hydrogenase enzymes enabling the production and oxidation of H2 are found in thousands of genomes spanning the three domains of life across aquatic, terrestrial, and even host-associated ecosystems. Even though H2 has already been proposed as a universal growth and maintenance energy source, its potential contribution as a driver of biogeochemical cycles has received little attention. Here, we bridge this knowledge gap by providing an overview of the classification, distribution, and physiological role of hydrogenases. Distribution of these enzymes in various microbial functional groups and recent experimental evidence are finally integrated to support the hypothesis that H2-oxidizing microbes are keystone species driving C cycling along O2 concentration gradients found in H2-rich soil ecosystems. In conclusion, we suggest focusing on the metabolic flexibility of H2-oxidizing microbes by combining community-level and individual-level approaches aiming to decipher the impact of H2 on C cycling and the C-cycling potential of H2-oxidizing microbes, via both culture-dependent and culture-independent methods, to give us more insight into the role of H2 as a driver of biogeochemical processes.",Bacterial Dispersers along Preferential Flow Paths of a Clay Till Depth Profile.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30658975,Applied and environmental microbiology,2019 04 14,"This study assessed the dispersal of five bacterial communities from contrasting compartments along a fractured clay till depth profile comprising plow layer soil, preferential flow paths (biopores and the tectonic fractures below), and matrix sediments, down to 350 cm below the surface. A recently developed expansion of the porous surface model (PSM) was used to capture bacterial communities dispersing under controlled hydration conditions on a soil-like surface. All five communities contained bacteria capable of active dispersal under relatively low hydration conditions (-3.1 kPa). Further testing of the plow layer community revealed active dispersal even at matric potentials of -6.3 to -8.4 kPa, previously thought to be too dry for dispersal on the PSM. Using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, the dispersing communities were found to be less diverse than their corresponding total communities. The dominant dispersers in most compartments belonged to the genus Pseudomonas and, in the plow layer soil, to Rahnella as well. An exception to this was the dispersing community in the matrix at 350 cm below the surface, which was dominated by Pantoea Hydrologically connected compartments shared proportionally more dispersing than nondispersing amplicon sequence variants (ASVs), suggesting that active dispersal is important for colonizing these compartments. These results highlight the importance of including soil profile heterogeneity when assessing the role of active dispersal and contribute to discerning the importance of active dispersal in the soil environment.IMPORTANCE The ability to disperse is considered essential for soil bacteria colonization and survival, yet very little is known about the dispersal ability of communities from different heterogeneous soil compartments. Important factors for dispersal are the thickness and connectivity of the liquid film between soil particles. The present results from a fractured clay till depth profile suggest that dispersal ability is common in various soil compartments and that most are dominated by a few dispersing taxa. Importantly, an increase in shared dispersers among the preferential flow paths of the clay till suggests that active dispersal plays a role in the successful colonization of these habitats."

Twenty-two patients who sustained an intra-articular calcaneal fracture underwent plantar pressure distribution measurements 6 months after surgery. Measurements were performed while patients walked on the pedobarography platform. The values of dynamic variables were significantly lower on the operated limb in the ELA. In the sinus tarsi approach, no differences were observed between the operated and uninjured limbs (UIN) at peak pressure and at maximal vertical force. The values of temporal variables (contact time of the foot and of the heel) between the operated and UIN differed in the ELA. The hypothesis that differences in foot load between operated and UIN will be more significant in the ELA was confirmed. Our results showed that the differences in loading and temporal variables between the operated and the UIN persisted 6 months after surgery in both methods. The operated limb was less loaded, with the tendency to shift the load toward the midfoot and forefoot. After the less invasive sinus tarsi approach, the dynamic and temporal variables on the operated limb were nearly the same as those on the healthy one.

The formation of protein adducts affects different proteins in cancer, triggering different mechanism, such as proliferation, cell differentiation and apoptosis, among others, altering cancer progression. The divergent results obtained documented that the formation of lipoxidation adducts can have either anti-carcinogenic or pro-carcinogenic effects, depending on the cell type affected and the specific adduct formed. Moreover, lipoxidation adducts may alter the immune response, consequently causing either positive or negative alterations in cancer progression. Therefore, in this review, we summarize the effects of lipoxidation adducts in cancer cells and immune components and their consequences in the evolution of different types of cancer.",Vimentin disruption by lipoxidation and electrophiles: Role of the cysteine residue and filament dynamics.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30658903,Redox biology,2019 06 02,"The intermediate filament protein vimentin constitutes a critical sensor for electrophilic and oxidative stress, which induce extensive reorganization of the vimentin cytoskeletal network. Here, we have investigated the mechanisms underlying these effects. In vitro, electrophilic lipids, including 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-prostaglandin J2 (15d-PGJ2) and 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE), directly bind to vimentin, whereas the oxidant diamide induces disulfide bond formation. Mutation of the single vimentin cysteine residue (Cys328) blunts disulfide formation and reduces lipoxidation by 15d-PGJ2, but not HNE. Preincubation with these agents differentially hinders NaCl-induced filament formation by wild-type vimentin, with effects ranging from delayed elongation and increased filament diameter to severe impairment of assembly or aggregation. Conversely, the morphology of vimentin Cys328Ser filaments is mildly or not affected. Interestingly, preformed vimentin filaments are more resistant to electrophile-induced disruption, although chemical modification is not diminished, showing that vimentin (lip)oxidation prior to assembly is more deleterious. In cells, electrophiles, particularly diamide, induce a fast and drastic disruption of existing filaments, which requires the presence of Cys328. As the cellular vimentin network is under continuous remodeling, we hypothesized that vimentin exchange on filaments would be necessary for diamide-induced disruption. We confirmed that strategies reducing vimentin dynamics, as monitored by FRAP, including cysteine crosslinking and ATP synthesis inhibition, prevent diamide effect. In turn, phosphorylation may promote vimentin disassembly. Indeed, treatment with the phosphatase inhibitor calyculin A to prevent dephosphorylation intensifies electrophile-induced wild-type vimentin filament disruption. However, whereas a phosphorylation-deficient vimentin mutant is only partially protected from disorganization, Cys328Ser vimentin is virtually resistant, even in the presence of calyculin A. Together, these results indicate that modification of Cys328 and vimentin exchange are critical for electrophile-induced network disruption.",[Renal toxicity of lithium].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30658901,Nephrologie & therapeutique,2019 04 07,"Besides its efficiency, lithium has a narrow therapeutic index and can result in considerable toxicity. Among the potential side effects, two types of renal toxicity are observed: a decreased renal concentrating ability and a chronic renal failure. Lithium-induced polyuria is frequent, estimated to affect up to 40% of patients, and develops usually early. It may be irreversible, especially if the treatment has been prescribed for more than 15 years. A chronic renal failure is observed in patients treated for more than 10 to 20 years. Its prevalence is estimated at 12% after 19 years of treatment. Some patients (0.5%) may reach end stage renal disease. The major risk factor is the duration of exposure to lithium. Discussion about stopping or not lithium in case of renal failure needs multidisciplinary expertise and depends on psychiatric status and renal function.",RTX Adhesins are Key Bacterial Surface Megaproteins in the Formation of Biofilms.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30658900,Trends in microbiology,2019 04 12,"Gram-negative bacteria produce repeats-in-toxin adhesion proteins (RTX adhesins) to facilitate microbial adhesion. These large, multidomain proteins share a common architecture comprised of four regions. First to emerge from the bacterium, C terminal end leading, is the RTX export sequence that directs the protein through the type 1 secretion system (T1SS). This is followed by the ligand-binding region responsible for host adhesion and cohesion, which contains diverse ligand-binding domains. These serve a zip code function to direct bacteria to a particular environmental niche. Thereafter is a large extension region consisting of tens to hundreds of tandem bacterial immunoglobulin-like (BIg) domains, whose function is to extend the reach of the ligand-binding domains away from the bacterial surface. Lastly, there is a conserved N terminal cell-membrane-anchor region that retains the adhesin within the secretion system. This is also a site of in situ proteolysis, when nutrients are scarce, that enables the bacterium to leave the biofilm. In this review, the four regions of RTX adhesins are presented in the order in which they emerge from the cell during synthesis and retention.",Targeted gene approach with biochemical assay confirms ABCD1 mutation of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy in a 62-year-old man with gait imbalance.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30658899,Neuromuscular disorders : NMD,2019 03 03,"X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy is a peroxisomal disorder caused by a mutation in ABCD1 gene. The three main phenotypes of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy include cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy, adrenomyeloneuropathy, and isolated primary adrenal insufficiency. More than 750 non-recurrent mutations exist throughout the coding region of the ABCD1 gene. We report a 62-year-old man with a 17-year history of progressive gait imbalance and numb feet. He had noted difficulty rising from a chair for 3 years. Examination revealed proximal lower limb weakness and length-dependent sensory loss with preservation of reflexes and unilateral Babinski sign. Electrodiagnostic evaluation confirmed a length-dependent sensorimotor peripheral neuropathy and proximal myopathy. Family history was remarkable for similar symptoms in 6 siblings. A targeted gene approach for 102 known peripheral neuropathy genes led to discovery of ABCD1 mutation confirmed by kindred evaluation and biochemical assay.

We report a CMT4C case associated with dropped head syndrome and predominant involvement of proximal muscles. An 11-year-old boy born to consanguineous parents presented with predominantly proximal muscle weakness with facial involvement, associated with dropped head and severe scoliosis. Symptoms started at the age of 3 years-old with frequent falls. Nerve conduction studies showed a sensorimotor demyelinating polyneuropathy. A comprehensive multigene next-generation sequencing panel for CMT revealed the homozygous pathogenic missense variant c.1969G > A (p.E657K) in SH3TC2 gene, confirming CMT4C diagnosis. The present report broadens the phenotype associated with CMT4C and raises the importance of considering early-onset inherited polyneuropathies in the differential diagnosis of patients with proximal muscle wasting associated with dropped head syndrome."

In this opinion article, we argue that research on explanation would benefit from more engagement with how the cognitive systems involved in generating explanations (e.g., attention, long-term memory) shape the outputs of this process. Although it is clear that these systems do shape explanation, surprisingly little research has investigated how they might do so. We outline the proposed mechanistic approach to explanation and illustrate it with an example: the recent research that suggests explanations exhibit a bias toward inherent information.

ASD is, however, often associated with medical comorbidities and gastrointestinal (GI) dysfunction is among the most common. Studies have demonstrated a correlation between GI dysfunction and the degree of social impairment in ASD. The etiology of GI abnormalities in ASD is unclear, though the association between GI dysfunction and ASD-associated behaviors suggest that overlapping developmental defects in the brain and the intestine and/or a defect in communication between the enteric and central nervous systems (ENS and CNS, respectively), known as the gut-brain axis, could be responsible for the observed phenotypes. Brain-gut abnormalities have been increasingly implicated in several disease processes, including ASD. As a critical modulator of ENS and CNS development and function, serotonin may be a nexus for the gut-brain axis in ASD. This paper reviews the role of serotonin in ASD from the perspective of the ENS. A murine model that has been demonstrated to possess brain, behavioral and GI abnormalities mimicking those seen in ASD harbors the most common serotonin transporter (SERT) based mutation (SERT Ala56) found in children with ASD. Discussion of the gut-brain manifestations in the SERT Ala56 mice, and their correction with developmental administration of a 5-HT4 agonist, are also addressed in conjunction with other future directions for diagnosis and treatment.",Impact of organ prioritization for immunologic sensitization and waiting times for heart transplantation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30658880,The Journal of heart and lung transplantation : the official publication of the International Society for Heart Transplantation,2019 02 18,The Canadian status 4S category prioritizes highly sensitized patients with a calculated panel reactive antibody (CPRA) > 80% awaiting heart transplantation.

Unfortunately, the plaster-of-Paris and fiberglass casts used to immobilize fractures affect HR-pQCT measurements due to beam hardening, and increased noise. The challenge is compounded because casts have variable thickness, and an individual patient will often have their cast changed 2-3 times during the course of treatment. This study quantifies the effect of casts within a clinically relevant range of thicknesses on measured bone parameters at the distal radius, and establishes conversion equations to correct for systematic error in due to cast presence. Eighteen nonfractured participants were scanned by HR-pQCT in three conditions: no cast, plaster-of-Paris cast, and fiberglass cast. Measured parameters were compared between the baseline scan (no cast) and each cast scan to evaluate if systematic error exists due to cast presence. A linear regression model was used to determine an appropriate conversion for parameters that were found to have systematic error. Plaster-of-Paris casts had a greater range of thicknesses (3.2-9.5 mm) than the fiberglass casts (3.0-5.4 mm), and induced a greater magnitude of systematic error overall. Key parameters of interest were bone mineral density (total, cortical, and trabecular) and trabecular bone volume fraction, all of which were found to have systematic error due to presence of either cast type. Linear correlations between baseline and cast scans for these parameters were excellent (R2 > 0.98), and appropriate conversions could be determined within a margin of error less than a ±6% for the plaster-of-Paris cast, and ±4% for the fiberglass cast. We have demonstrated the effects of cast presence on bone microarchitecture measurements, and presented a method to correct for systematic error, in support of future use of HR-pQCT to study fracture healing.",Prevention and treatment of pressure ulcers/injuries: The protocol for the second update of the international Clinical Practice Guideline 2019.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30658878,Journal of tissue viability,2019 04 30,"The European Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel, the Pan Pacific Pressure Injury Alliance, and the National Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel are updating the 'Prevention and Treatment of Pressure Ulcers: Clinical Practice Guideline' (CPG) in 2019.

Its time course during the open phase of the vibratory cycle is essential in the mechanics of phonation, but measuring it directly is difficult and may hinder spontaneous voicing. However, it can be computed from the in vivo measured transglottal flow and glottal area (hence the air particle velocity) on the basis of the Bernoulli energy law and the interaction with the inertance of the vocal tract. As to sustained modal phonation, calculations are presented for the two possible shapes of glottal duct: convergent and divergent, including absolute calibration in order to obtain quantitative physical values. Whatever the glottal duct configuration, the calculations based on measured values of glottal area and air flow show that the integrated intraglottal pressure during the opening phase systematically exceeds that during the closing phase, which is the basic condition for sustaining vocal fold oscillation. The key point is that the airflow curve is skewed to the right relative to the glottal area curve. The skewing results from air compressibility and vocal tract inertance. The intraglottal pressure becomes negative during the closing phase. As to the soft (or physiological) voice onset, a similar approach shows that the integrated pressure differences (opening phase - closing phase) actually increase as the onset progresses, and this applies to the results based on Bernoulli's energy law as well as to those based on the interaction with the inertance of the vocal tract. Furthermore and similarly, the phase lead of the pressure wave with respect to the glottal opening progressively increases. The underlying explanation lies in the progressively increasing skewing of the airflow curve to the right with respect to the glottal area curve.",Accuracy of Thyroid Cartilage Fenestration During Montgomery Medialization Thyroplasty.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30658874,Journal of voice : official journal of the Voice Foundation,2019 01 19,"Accuracy of thyroid cartilage fenestration during Montgomery thyroplasty (MTIS) is considered a key success factor.

Disease-induced alterations in the activity of networks controlling SPNs could contribute to this imbalance. One of these networks is anchored by the parafascicular nucleus (PFn) of the thalamus. To determine the role of the PFn in striatal PD pathophysiology, optogenetic, chemogenetic, and electrophysiological tools were used in ex vivo slices from transgenic mice with region-specific Cre recombinase expression. These studies revealed that in parkinsonian mice, the functional connectivity of PFn neurons with indirect pathway SPNs (iSPNs) was selectively enhanced by cholinergic interneurons acting through presynaptic nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) on PFn terminals. Attenuating this network adaptation by chemogenetic or genetic strategies alleviated motor-learning deficits in parkinsonian mice, pointing to a potential new therapeutic strategy for PD patients.",Functional Synaptic Architecture of Callosal Inputs in Mouse Primary Visual Cortex.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30658859,Neuron,2019 02 13,"Callosal projections are thought to play a critical role in coordinating neural activity between the cerebral hemispheres in placental mammals, but the rules that govern the arrangement of callosal synapses on the dendrites of their target neurons remain poorly understood.

We find that callosal-recipient spines are more likely to cluster with non-callosal-recipient spines with similar orientation preference. These observations, based on optogenetic stimulation, were confirmed by direct anatomical visualization of callosal synaptic connections using post hoc expansion microscopy. Our results demonstrate, for the first time, that functional synaptic clustering in a short dendritic segment could play a role in integrating distinct neuronal circuits.","Effect of Hydrostatic Pressure, Boundary Constraints and Viscosity on the Vaporization Threshold of Low-Boiling-Point Phase-Change Contrast Agents.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30658858,Ultrasound in medicine & biology,2019 05 01,"The vaporization of low-boiling-point phase-change contrast agents (PCCAs) using ultrasound has been explored in vitro and in vivo. However, it has been reported that the pressure required for activation is higher in vivo, even after attenuation is accounted for. In this study, the effect of boundary constraints, hydrostatic pressure and viscosity on PCCA vaporization pressure threshold are evaluated to explore possible mechanisms for variations in in vivo vaporization behavior. Vaporization was measured in microtubes of varying inner diameter and a pressurized chamber under different hydrostatic pressures using a range of ultrasound pressures. Furthermore, the activation threshold was evaluated in the kidneys of rats. The results confirm that the vaporization threshold is higher in vivo and reveal an increasing activation threshold inversely proportional to constraining tube size and inversely proportional to surrounding viscosity in constrained environments. Counterintuitively, increased hydrostatic pressure had no significant effect experimentally on the PCCA vaporization threshold, although it was confirmed that this result was supported by homogeneous nucleation theory for liquid perfluorocarbon vaporization. These factors suggest that constraints caused by the surrounding tissue and capillary walls, as well as increased viscosity in vivo, contribute to the increased vaporization threshold compared with in vitro experiments, although more work is required to confirm all relevant factors.","The Trier Social Stress Test in first episode psychosis patients: Impact of perceived stress, protective factors and childhood trauma.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30658856,Psychoneuroendocrinology,2019 06 16,"Psychosis has been associated with abnormalities in hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis functioning, which may emerge through heightened stress sensitivity following early life adversity - ultimately resulting in illness onset and progression.

A total of 100 volunteers participated in the study, 57 of whom were patients with a FEP (mean age 23.9 ± 3.8) and 43 healthy community controls (mean age 23.2 ± 3.9). Salivary cortisol, heart rate and blood pressure were measured at eight time points before and after the Trier Social Stress Test. Subjective stress and protective factors were assessed with the Perceived Stress Scale, the Self-Esteem Rating Scale and the Brief COPE. Early life adversity was assessed with the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire. Patients compared to controls showed significantly lower cortisol levels (F = 7.38; p = .008) throughout the afternoon testing period, but no difference in the cortisol response to the TSST. Heart rate was elevated and protective factors were lower in patients compared to controls. Attenuated cortisol levels were associated with higher levels of perceived stress, poor protective factors and more physical neglect during childhood. Our results suggest that attenuated baseline cortisol levels and not a blunted response during an acute stress task might be an indicator of heightened stress vulnerability and poor resilience in psychosis.

N-(3-Aminopropyl)-imidazole was pre-grafted onto carboxymethyl chitosan to fabricate the pH-sensitive nanoparticles (AM NPs), then was surface-modified with perfluorobutyric anhydride to give the fluorinated nanoparticles (FM NPs). AM and FM NPs had a regular spherical structure with the size about 150-160 nm, which was kinetically stabled in the physical environment and showed pH-triggered drug release at mildly acidic conditions. A series of cell experiments verified that surface fluorination of nanoparticles could enhance cellular uptake and improve cytotoxicity in different tumor cells without the targeting recognition between host and ligands. Besides, fluorine-modified nanoparticles had longer-term blood circulation and more accumulation in tumor site, resulting in higher bioavailability and superior antitumor efficiency for anticancer drugs in vivo. These results suggested that the pH-sensitive and fluorinated nanoparticles had great potential as be efficient drug currieries for cancer chemotherapy.",Fabrication of hemicelluloses films with enhanced mechanical properties by graphene oxide for humidity sensing.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30658831,Carbohydrate polymers,2019 01 31,"An effective and green method to incorporate graphene oxide into quaternized hemicelluloses to form a hemicelluloses based film was introduced in this study. Tight, homogeneous, and smooth surfaces of the film were obtained from the SEM image. Data on the mechanical properties of the films indicated that the hybrid films prepared from QH and GO (component of GO was 4.8%) exhibited a high tensile strength of 43.83 MPa. This finding suggested that addition of GO contributed to the desirable mechanical properties of the hybrid film. The hybrid films exhibited high sensitivity to humidity; they could be bent spontaneously under wet conditions within seconds and stretched under dry conditions. In addition, the results of DMA indicated that the storage modulus of the hybrid films had an order of magnitude change in value at different humidities. These characteristics show that films can be potentially used in bio-medicine, packaging materials, and humidity sensors.",Investigating the usefulness of chitosan based proton exchange membranes tailored with exfoliated molybdenum disulfide nanosheets for clean energy applications.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30658830,Carbohydrate polymers,2019 01 31,"Chitosan based proton exchange membranes (PEMs) has been synthesized by a facile solution casting strategy using two-dimensional exfoliated molybdenum disulfide (E-MoS2) nanosheets. The prepared PEMs are characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), Field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) with Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), water uptake, Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), AC impedance spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry. In comparison with pure chitosan membrane, E-MoS2 nanosheets incorporated membranes exhibit excellent water absorbing capacity, ion-exchange capacity and proton conductivity. Moreover, the changes in roughness of nanocomposite membranes is investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and the results confirm that the E-MoS2 nanosheets content enhances the surface roughness as well as provide good mechanical and thermal resistivity to the chitosan/E-MoS2 membranes. Chitosan membranes with 0.75% E-MoS2 nanosheets demonstrated higher proton conductivity of 2.92 × 10-3 Scm-1 and membrane selectivity of 8.9 × 104 Scm-3 s with reduced methanol permeability of 3.28 × 10-8 cm2 s-1. Overall, results evidenced that the chitosan/E-MoS2 nanocomposite membranes will be an alternate to Nafion in direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs).",Flexible photochromic cellulose triacetate based bionanocomposites modified with sol-gel synthesized V2O5 nanoparticles.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30658829,Carbohydrate polymers,2019 01 31,"Transparent and flexible bionanocomposites with photochromic properties based on cellulose triacetate (CTA) and sol-gel synthesized V2O5 nanoparticles were prepared. Poly(ethylene oxide-b-propylene oxide-b-ethylene oxide) (EPE) triblock copolymer was added to achieve nanostructured materials and simultaneously control the dispersion of synthesized V2O5 nanoparticles. Investigated bionanocomposites were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), atomic force microscopy (AFM), tensile tests, and UV-vis spectroscopy. FTIR results confirmed the presence of hydrogen bonds in the bionanocomposites. The miscibility between components improved with the increase of sol-gel content resulting in a decrease of the Tg and Tm of CTA phase as indicated by DSC results. Addition of EPE triblock copolymer enhanced the photochromic properties of bionanocomposites reducing the time of recovery to the initial state after 5 min of UV light irradiation. The biocompatibility of pure CTA and EPE/CTA blends as well as the photochromic properties provided by synthesized V2O5 nanoparticles make their transparent and flexible bionanocomposites ideal for possible future applications.",Unique thermo-responsivity and tunable optical performance of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)-cellulose nanocrystal hydrogel films.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30658828,Carbohydrate polymers,2019 01 31,"A hybrid materials system to modulate lower critical solution temperature (LCST) and moisture content for thermo-responsivity and optical tunability was strategically developed by incorporating cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) into a poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAm) hydrogel matrix. The PNIPAm/CNC hydrogel films exhibit tunable optical properties and wavelength bandpass selectivity as characterized by PROBE Spectroscopy and Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS). Importantly, the micro/nano structures of the PNIPAm/CNC hydrogel films were completely different when dried below and above the LCST. Below the LCST, PNIPAm/CNC hydrogel films exhibit transparency or semi-transparency due to the uniform bonding of hydrophilic PNIPAm and CNC through hydrogen bonds. Above the LCST, the hydrogel films engage in both hydrophobic PNIPAm and hydrophilic CNC interactions due to changes in PNIPAm conformation which lead to light scattering effects and hence opacity. Furthermore, the incorporation of CNC induces a ∼ 15 °C reduction of the LCST relative to pure PNIPAm hydrogel films.",β-Cyclodextrin modified electrospinning fibers with good regeneration for efficient temperature-enhanced adsorption of crystal violet.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30658827,Carbohydrate polymers,2019 01 31,"Novel β-cyclodextrin modified fibers with highly insoluble infraction and temperature enhanced adsorption performance were fabricated via electrospinning technology and followed thermo-crosslinking. The fabricated fibers were characterized by FT-IR, 1H NMR, TGA and SEM. In the fibers, β-CD was crosslinked with methacrylic acid (MAA) units to maintain morphologies of fibers and further be utilized for the adsorption of Crystal Violet through complex and electrostatic interaction. In particular, N-isopropyl acrylamide (NIPAM) units were introduced to create thermo-responsively hydrophobic internal cavity within the swelling fibers at high temperatures. Benefiting from that, the maximum adsorption amount could reach to 1253.78 mg g-1, enhanced by 20% than that at low temperatures. The adsorption data of the fibers fit well the pseudo-second-order model and Langmuir isotherm model. Moreover, the fibers could maintain high regeneration efficiency even after four adsorption-desorption cycles. These results indicated the practical application values of the β-cyclodextrin modified fibers in the dye wastewater treatment field.","Modification of chitosan and chitosan nanoparticle by long chain pyridinium compounds: Synthesis, characterization, antibacterial, and antioxidant activities.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30658826,Carbohydrate polymers,2019 05 13,"Chitosan is an antibacterial biopolymer and conjugation of it with other antimicrobial agents can be a valuable method to improve the potential application of the resultant materials in the various industries such as cosmetics, food and packaging materials.

The film was characterized by scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and thermogravimetric analysis. This film was transparent, orderly, thermally stable, and uniform in size, with an average width less than 1 μm. Also, the film exhibited excellent antibacterial efficiency (97.1% against E. coli, 99.7% against S. aureus, 97.3% against S. enterica and 99.9% against B. subtilis) in our antibacterial test. In addition, the film promoted wound healing with the advanced development of neovascularization and hair follicles.

The optimization was based on maximizing contact angle, ultimate tensile strength (UTS), strain at break (SAB), lightness (L), antibacterial activity, while minimizing water vapour permeability)WVP(, solubility, swelling, yellowness index (YI), and total color difference (ΔE) values. An increase in the CMC/gelatin ratio in the film formulations caused a decrease in WVP, SAB, ΔE, and YI. In addition, the incorporation of CHNF improved their mechanical strength and barrier properties. Furthermore, the addition of AJEO clearly improved the antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli, while reducing the mechanical and light barrier properties. The optimal values of CMC, CHNF and AJEO for composition of the gelatin film were 15.83 (wt%), 3 (wt%) and 0.74 (v/v%), respectively.","Nucleation, reorganization and disassembly of an active network from lactose-modified chitosan mimicking biological matrices.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30658823,Carbohydrate polymers,2019 05 13,"Developing synthetic materials able to mimic micro- and macrorheological properties of natural networks opens up to novel applications and concepts in materials science. The present contribution describes an active network based on a semi-synthetic polymer, a lactitol-bearing chitosan derivative (Chitlac), and a transient inorganic cross-linker, boric acid. Due to the many and diverse anchoring points for boric acid on the flanking groups of Chitlac, the cross-links constantly break and reform in a highly dynamic fashion. The consequence is a network with unusual non-equilibrium and mechanical properties closely resembling the rheological behavior of natural three-dimensional arrangements and of cytoskeleton. Concepts like network nucleation, reorganization and disassembly are declined in terms of amount of the cross-linker, which acts as a putative motor for remodeling of the network upon application of energy. The out-of-equilibrium and non-linear behavior render the semi-synthetic system of great interest for tissue engineering and for developing in-vitro mimics of natural active matrices."

Carboxymethylation of pulp fiber was carried out using isopropanol (IPA) as the sole solvent. IPA was recovered after carboxymethylation reaction and recycled in the next carboxymethylation reaction. Simple recycling of IPA decreased the reaction efficiency of carboxymethylation due to the increase of water content in the IPA. To dehydrate the recovered IPA, a 4 Å molecular sieve was used as a drying material. It was shown that dehydration restored carboxymethylation efficiency to the same level as when fresh IPA was used. The characteristics of the carboxymethylated CNFs produced using the recycled IPA were evaluated, including fibrillation tendency, average width, and width distribution, and it was shown that the use of recycled IPA after dehydration treatment did not cause any changes in carboxymethylated CNF properties. Recycling IPA after simple dehydration using a molecular sieve is thus a cost-effective and environmentally friendly method of producing carboxymethylated CNF.",A potential carrier for anti-tumor targeted delivery-hyaluronic acid nanoparticles.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30658811,Carbohydrate polymers,2019 05 13,"In recent years, biomacromolecules have been widely used in anti-tumor delivery systems due to the biocompatibility and biodegradability. However, their applications are limited due to the lack of specific targeting. Hyaluronic acid (HA) is a natural polysaccharide and presents in extracellular matrix and synovial fluid which can specifically recognize receptors over-expressed by tumor cells. In addition, they can self-assemble into nanoparticles. HA nanoparticles provide new hierarchical targeting strategies: passively targeting tumor tissue by enhanced permeability and retention effect, actively targeting tumor cells by cluster determinant 44 (CD44) receptor, and then entering cells through receptor-mediated endocytosis. In this review, the synthesis of HA nanoparticles is described in detail from several aspects and applications are also discussed for improving the delivery of hydrophobic drugs, nucleic acids and photosensitizers into the tumor cells. In addition, the modification of HA for improving the targeting and drug releasing characteristics are also discussed.",The role of intermolecular interactions on the encapsulation of human insulin into the chitosan and cholesterol-grafted chitosan polymers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30658810,Carbohydrate polymers,2019 05 13,"Chitosan and its derivatives used in drug delivery investigations could contribute to improving peptide and protein drug delivery systems. Herein, the molecular dynamics (MD) simulation approach was applied to evaluate the important driving factors of the human insulin encapsulation into the chitosan and cholesterol-modified chitosan polymers. The MD results revealed that the native conformation of insulin was stabilized by the chitosan polymers. In the present study, the effect of cholesterol moieties of modified chitosan was also examined and the results indicated that the cholesterol components would decrease the tendency of chitosan polymers to human insulin. Further analyses showed that the intermolecular interactions between the tyrosine, phenylalanine, and acidic residues are important in the formation of the insulin-polymer complexes. Another interesting finding was that the van der Waals, electrostatic, and CH-π interactions play key roles in the encapsulation process. Generally, in the case of human insulin, the MD simulation results would seem to suggest that the chitosan nanoparticles could be the more suitable carrier than the cholesterol-grafted chitosan nanoparticles.","Highly mineralized chitosan-based material with large size, gradient mineral distribution and hierarchical structure.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30658809,Carbohydrate polymers,2019 01 31,"Nature materials constituted with organic and inorganic components have hierarchical structure and superior performance. Although a variety of techniques have been developed to mimic microstructure and properties of natural mineralized materials, facile and rapid fabrication of large-size bulk materials with high calcium content under ambient conditions still remains a major challenge. Here, we present a feasible and versatile route to a highly mineralized material with an in situ preparation method where gelation and mineralization occur simultaneously. Meanwhile, hierarchically ordered hydrogel microstructures are formed during the gelation, and controllable inorganic gradient distribution forms along with mineralization spontaneously. With the achievement of high mineral content by the assistance of urea, this fabrication route is facile and efficient, only taking several hours to complete the gelation and mineralization, and large-scale materials are prepared readily. This chitosan matrix-directed mineralization represents a rational and promising strategy for fast fabrication of highly mineralized material with hierarchical structure on a large scale, and the chitosan-based mineralized material has great potential for applications in bone repairing and tissue engineering.",Lightweight and porous cellulose-based foams with high loadings of zeolitic imidazolate frameworks-8 for adsorption applications.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30658808,Carbohydrate polymers,2019 01 31,"The excess emission of toxic gases in atmosphere and heavy metal ions in drinking water is still a serious threat to human health. In this paper, a lightweight and porous zeolitic imidazolate frameworks-8@cellulose nanofiber@cellulose foam (ZIF-8@CNF@cellulose foam) with excellent gas adsorption and heavy metal ions removal properties was prepared using a simple in situ green growth method. The nitrogen adsorption property of ZIF-8@CNF@cellulose foam was 30 times higher than pure cellulose foam. Furthermore, the adsorption testing demonstrated that the composite foam showed high adsorption capacity for fluorescent dyes (24.6 mg g-1 for rhodamine B), heavy metal ions (35.6 mg g-1 for Cr (VI)) and organic solvents (45.2 g g-1 for DMF). Additionally, the ZIF-8/cellulose-based foam with 40 wt.% CNF exhibited an excellent mechanical performance, reaching a compressive strength value of 1.30 MPa.

In the present study, we identified the multifunctional protein lactoferrin as a novel interaction partner for polySia. Lactoferrin co-precipitated when polySia was isolated from human blood, milk, and semen samples. The interaction between polySia and lactoferrin was verified using a native gel electrophoresis application, demonstrating that such interaction depends on the degree of polymerization. The interaction between the molecules could be inhibited by an antibody against lactoferricin (LFcin), which suggests that the LFcin domain of lactoferrin represents the potential binding area for sialic acid polymers. Because lactoferrin inhibits the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), the potential impact of polySia on this function of lactoferrin was tested. Intriguingly, we observed that polySia increases the efficiency of lactoferrin to prevent the release of NET fibers. PolySia alone shows no activity. Therefore, together with lactoferrin, polySia may represent a natural regulatory system of NET release.",Sulfonation of dialdehyde cellulose extracted from sugarcane bagasse for synergistically enhanced water solubility.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30658805,Carbohydrate polymers,2019 01 31,"Sulfonated cellulose (SC) was successfully derived from microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) extracted from sugarcane bagasse, which is a type of agricultural waste. The obtained MCC was first modified by oxidation using sodium periodate in order to cleave the carbon-carbon bonds at the C2 and C3 of the pyranose ring to form 2,3-dialdehyde cellulose. These activated aldehyde groups significantly facilitated the sulfonation carried out using potassium metabisulfite. The sulfonic acid group contents, surface morphology, and water solubility of the obtained products were characterized by titration, field-emission scanning electron microscopy, UV-vis spectroscopy, and zeta potential. High sulfonic acid group content was achieved for the obtained SC samples (i.e., 305-689 μmol/g). The increase in the sulfonic acid group content resulted in the gradual change in the surface morphology and water solubility of the SC samples. The obtained results imply that sugarcane bagasse is a promising raw material for the production of SC with good water solubility.","Effects of the anti-angiogenic carbohydrate-peptide conjugate, chitooligosaccharide-ES2 on endothelial cells and tumor-bearing mice.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30658804,Carbohydrate polymers,2019 05 13,"Most solid tumors require neovascularization during their growth. In our previous study, ES2 (IVRRADRAAVP) was covalently conjugated to soluble chitooligosaccharide chloride (HTCOSC) to form one novel HTCOSC-ES2 conjugate, which displayed better anti-angiogenic activity. In this work, the intracellular distribution and endocytosis of the conjugate in endothelial cells, as well effects on endothelial cell cycle and apoptosis were investigated. In addition, pharmacokinetic and antitumor studies were conducted. HTCOSC-ES2 entered the cell via clathrin and lipid valve pathway and was transported to the nucleus via lysosomal transport mechanism. Unlike ES2, HTCOSC-ES2 effectively inhibited the growth of endothelial cells and promoted apoptosis; thus, it could inhibit tumor angiogenesis, resulting in strong anti-tumor activity in vivo. The half-life of HTCOSC-ES2 was also prolonged, and its clearance was delayed. Immunohistochemistry assays showed that HTCOSC-ES2 obviously reduced the microvessel density, decreased the expression of VEGF, and increased the expression of caspase-3.",Green one-pot synthesis of carboxymethylcellulose/Zn-based metal-organic framework/graphene oxide bio-nanocomposite as a nanocarrier for drug delivery system.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30658803,Carbohydrate polymers,2019 05 13,"The aim of present work is to improve the solubility, surface charged and capacity of drug loading of graphene oxide (GO) by modification of GO with carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) and Zinc-based metal-organic framework (MOF-5) to realize and control accurately the release manner.

The prepared CMC/MOF-5/GO was characterized and used as a carrier to encapsulate the doxorubicin (DOX) as an anticancer drug. The obtained compounds were characterized using SEM, AFM, XRD, FTIR, EDX spectroscopy, BET and Zeta potentials-DLS analysis. The AFM images of GO and CMC/MOF-5/GO illustrated that the sheet thickness of GO was around 30 nm, which increased to ˜80 nm after modification with CMC and MOF-5.In addition, the drug delivery evaluation showed that the DOX-loaded bio-nanocomposites enhanced anticancer properties. Under tumor cell microenvironment at pH 5, the DOX release rate was significantly higher than that under physiological conditions at pH 7.4. The MTT results showed that DOX@CMC/MOF-5/GO exhibits notable cytotoxicity to K562 cells.

Levans are produced by many lactic acid bacteria, e.g. during sourdough fermentation. Levans have shown prebiotic properties and may also function as in situ-produced hydrocolloids. So far, levan contents have been measured by acid hydrolysis, which cannot distinguish levans from e.g. inulins. In order to develop a specific analysis for levan in food matrices, a Paenibacillus amylolyticus endolevanase was combined with exoinulinase for levan hydrolysis. A separate endoinulinase treatment was used to detect the possible presence of inulin. Interfering sugars were removed by a pre-wash with aqueous ethanol. Levan content was estimated from fructose and glucose released in the hydrolysis, with a correction made for the residual fructose and glucose-containing sugars. The method was validated using wheat model doughs spiked with commercial Erwinia levan, and tested by analyzing levan content in Leuconostoc mesenteroides DSM 20343-fermented fava bean doughs."

Grinding energy was determined in terms of total energy, effective energy, and was related to nanofiber yield. Fiber morphology, crystalline and chemical structures were analyzed to reveal the mechanisms behind enzyme actions. The results showed that with enzyme pretreatment, the effective energy was reduced by 60%, and yield of nanofibers was increased by 76%. With enzyme pretreatment, nanofibers were smaller and more uniform in diameter, which resulted in more transparent nanofilms. The mechanical strength of nanofilm was decreased slightly when enzyme dosage is high, however, in any cases, nanofibers remained high thermal stability. Therefore, this bio-mechanical process can be a commercially viable, energy-effective nanofibers manufacturing process with less environmental impact.",Desiccation tolerance in plants: Structural characterization of the cell wall hemicellulosic polysaccharides in three Selaginella species.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30658789,Carbohydrate polymers,2019 05 13,"Drought-induced dehydration of vegetative tissues in lycopods affects growth and survival.

Altogether, these data highlight the fact that structural remodeling of cell wall hemicellulosic polysaccharides including XXXG-rich xyloglucan, arabinoxylan and acetylated galactomannan is an important process in order to mitigate desiccation stress in Selaginella.",Enhancement of hemostatic property of plant derived oxidized nanocellulose-silk fibroin based scaffolds by thrombin loading.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30658788,Carbohydrate polymers,2019 05 13,To combat post-surgical and traumatic bleeding conditions effective hemostasis is of great importance. The study was designed to investigate the effect of thrombin (Th) loading on hemostatic performance of TEMPO-oxidized cellulose nanofiber (TOCN)-silk fibroin (SF) scaffolds. Addition of SF with TOCN significantly (***P < 0.001) increased blood absorption capacity and improved biocompatibility of TOCN. Thrombin loading potentiated platelet activation and hemostatic property of scaffolds (TOCN-SF-Th) compared to samples without thrombin (TOCN-SF). The hemostatic time of TOCN-SF5-Th in rabbit ear artery bleeding model was reduced (*** P < 0.001) to 114 s from 220 s of TOCN-SF5. Reduction in bleeding time and blood loss of TOCN-SF5-Th in rat tail amputation and liver avulsion model was comparable to commercial hemostat (Floseal). Surface morphology (SEM) of samples applied on bleeding site showed that RBCs and fibrin fiber could strongly interact with TOCN-SF and TOCN-SF-Th scaffolds. The result suggests that TOCN-SF-Th can be a promising candidate for designing hemostatic agents.,Structural characterization of corn silk polysaccharides and its effect in H2O2 induced oxidative damage in L6 skeletal muscle cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30658787,Carbohydrate polymers,2019 05 13,"To evaluate the antioxidant activity of polysaccharides from corn silk in H2O2 induced oxidative damage in L6 skeletal muscle cells. A polysaccharide (CSP2) was isolated from corn silk. Structure analysis of CSP2 with 1D and 2D NMR indicated that CSP2 was composed of (1→6)-linked α-d-glucose. The substituent of the α-d-glucose is composed of (1→3)-linked α-l-arabinose, (1→4)-linked β-d-galactose and (1→3,5)-linked β-d-mannose, with β-d-xylose and α-l-rhamnose as terminal unit. CSP2 had the potential to scavenge DPPH and hydroxyl radical and inhibit hemolysis in vitro. CSP2 was found to suppress oxidant stress by improving the enzyme activities of SOD, CAT, and GPX. Rodamine 123 staining results showed that the pretreatment of CSP2 prevented changes in the mitochondrial membrane potential and increased the ﬂuorescence intensity in L6 cells in the presence of H2O2. These results suggested that CSP2 could be utilized as a potential antioxidant supplement to prevent oxidative stress.",Monitoring of κ-carrageenan depolymerization by capillary electrophoresis and semisynthesis of oligosaccharide alditols.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30658786,Carbohydrate polymers,2019 01 31,"Different hydrolysis conditions to produce κ-carrageenan oligosaccharide alditols were studied and the depolymerization process monitored by capillary electrophoresis (CE). Semisynthesis, ion-exchange and exclusion chromatography were used to obtain and isolate sulfated di-, tetra- and hexasaccharide alditols, the last being fully characterized for the first time. Those derivatives were used as standards to validate a new quantitative CE analytical method which was used to compare two different partial hydrolysis methodologies: an acid hydrolysis followed by reduction and a one-pot reductive hydrolysis using 4-methylmorpholine borane. The resulting depolymerization profiles were quite different from each other. Optimal hydrolysis conditions to produce high yields of specific sulfated oligosaccharides as well as particular mixtures of oligosaccharide alditols were determined. Moreover, using the novel CE method, we were able to distinguish up to eight different oligosaccharides in the hydrolysate mixtures.",Microalgae starch-based bioplastics: Screening of ten strains and plasticization of unfractionated microalgae by extrusion.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30658785,Carbohydrate polymers,2019 01 31,"Microalgae were considered in this work as a new resource for developing starch-based bioplastics. Ten green microalgae strains were screened at lab-scale for their ability to produce starch. A long run (800 h) two-stage accumulation strategy was designed with successive cultivation in sulfur-replete, then sulfur-depleted medium in autotrophic conditions. Starch content was assessed on cell lysate by enzymatic digestion of extracted starch into glucose. Chlamydomonas reinhardtii 11-32A strain was selected as it displayed a maximum starch-to-biomass ratio of 49%w/w, 460 h after being switched to a sulfur-deprived medium. Small-scale pilot production (30 L tubular photobioreactor) with C. reinhardtii 11-32A yielded sufficient biomass quantity to investigate its direct plasticization with glycerol in a twin-screw extruder. Microstructural characterization confirmed the ability for starch-enriched microalgae to be homogeneously plasticized, and hence the possibility to use microalgae as a new platform for the development of bioplastics.",Superhydrophobic and flame retardant cotton modified with DOPO and fluorine-silicon-containing crosslinked polymer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30658784,Carbohydrate polymers,2019 01 31,"Modification of cotton fabric to achieve superhydrophobic, self-cleaning and heat resistance is of particular interest for practical applications. Herein, a simple surface modification route is designed to introduce flame retardant component 9, 10-dihydro-9-oxa-10-phosphaphenanthrene 10-oxide (DOPO) and low surface energy crosslinked polymer network comprising both fluorine and silicon elements on the surface of cotton fabric. The modified cotton fabric shows characteristic of superhydrophobic property with water contact angle of 154.8°, and exhibits promising self-cleaning performance. With the characters of hydrophobicity and lipophilicity, the modified cotton fabric can efficiently separate oil-water mixture and even emulsion. Moreover, the introduction of DOPO and fluorine-silicon-containing coating not only enhances the heat resistance of cotton, but also improves the flame retardant property.","Impact of pH, ionic strength and chitosan charge density on chitosan/casein complexation and phase behavior.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30658783,Carbohydrate polymers,2019 01 31,"The interaction between polysaccharides and proteins has attracted great interests and the phase behavior and colloidal properties of complexes between chitosan, a positively charged polysaccharide, and proteins still need careful investigation. Here, we use chitosan/casein as model system and monitor their complex size, zeta-potential, light scattering intensity and phase behavior as functions of chitosan deacetylation degree, pH and ionic strength. Chitosan flocculates casein at low polysaccharide concentrations, while stabilizes casein at moderate to high concentrations. Such flocculation and stabilization ability are dependent on the linear charge density of chitosan, where high charge density chitosan saturates casein surface charge and stabilizes the complexes at lower polysaccharide concentration. The complexes are stable at acidic pH where chitosan is highly protonated and the addition of NaCl leads to the reduction in both size and zeta-potential and facilitates complex aggregation. The phase maps are constructed to provide guidelines for further studies on chitosan/casein and other chitosan/protein complexes.",Dispersion of reduced graphene oxide within thermoplastic starch/poly(lactic acid) blends investigated by small-angle X-ray scattering.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30658782,Carbohydrate polymers,2019 01 31,"Reduced graphene oxide (rGO) was incorporated into plasticized cornstarch (TPS), poly(lactic acid) (PLA) and their blends. Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) was used to investigate rGO dispersion within the materials. For the TPS/PLA blend at 70:30 composition, the incorporation of rGO led to a larger fraction of small-sized rGO sheets, which at 5.0 mass% content developed stable fractal structures and domains of correlated sheets. The formation of fractal structures resulted in substantial enhancements in macroscopic properties. For these hybrids, the electrical conductivity, melt viscosity, storage moduli and biodegradation rates presented enhancements in relation to the neat blend. For the TPS/PLA blend at 30:70 composition, SAXS results indicated the formation of smaller fractions of well-dispersed rGO sheets and of segregated larger rGO sheets. With rGO at 5 mass% content, less expressive increases in electrical conductivity, melt viscosity, storage moduli and biodegradation rates were observed.",A novel method for preparing microcrystalline cellulose from bleached chemical pulp using transition metal ions enhanced high temperature liquid water process.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30658781,Carbohydrate polymers,2019 01 31,"A novel method for preparing microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) from bleached chemical pulp based on the transition metal ion-enhanced high temperature liquid water (HTLW) process was established in this study. Transition metal ions (Fe3+, Cu2+ or Cr3+) were used to enhance the depolymerization effect of HTLW treatment on fibers. Hemicelluloses are selectively removed, resulting in an increase in the α-cellulose content; cellulose undergoes hydrolytic degradation, causing a significant decrease in the average degree of polymerization (DP). SEM images indicated that the as-prepared MCC had granular or rod-like shape. The repose angle results showed a desirable fluidity of obtained MCC. The copper number results showed an increase in the reducing end groups of the obtained MCC. The XRD analysis indicated that the cellulose crystallite exhibited negligible changes, and the crystallization index (CI) increased. However, a very high concentration of transition metal ions lowered the CI. The transition metal ion-enhanced HTLW treatment provides an acid free method for preparing MCC."

A ""closed-type"" question based on triangle test and paired comparison was used for sensory evaluation. The absolute threshold and nine sensory difference threshold values were determined and used to generate a sweet sensory difference strength curve. Defining absolute threshold of sucrose sweetness as 1, the sucrose sweetness at any concentration could be calculated via the curve. After taking the logarithm of each curve, sweetness index was calculated as 1, 1.12, 0.94, 1.29, and 1.25 for sucrose, glucose, fructose, lactose and maltose, respectively. Based on this, each sugar concentration and sweetness could be converted and calculated. Single sugar and mixed-sugars sweetness comparison experiments verified the new sweetness index and sweetness values were more accurate (83.3-100%) than those reported in previous studies. Therefore, this new definition and conversion method established more reliable references for sweet taste sensory applications.",Combining mid infrared spectroscopy and paper spray mass spectrometry in a data fusion model to predict the composition of coffee blends.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30658767,Food chemistry,2019 03 13,"This paper describes a robust multivariate model for quantifying and characterizing blends of Robusta and Arabica coffees. At different degrees of roasting, 120 ground coffee blends (0.0-33.0%) were formulated. Spectra were obtained by two different techniques, attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy and paper spray mass spectrometry (PS-MS). Partial least squares (PLS) models were built individually with the two types of spectra. Nevertheless, better predictions were obtained by low and medium-level data fusion, taking advantage from the synergy between these two data sets. Data fusion models were improved by variable selection, using genetic algorithms (GA) and ordered predictors selection (OPS). The smallest prediction errors were provided by OPS low-level data fusion model. The number of variables used for regression was reduced from 2145 (full spectra) to 230. Model interpretation was performed by assigning some of the selected variables to specific coffee components, such as trigonelline and chlorogenic acids.",Optimization of the protein extraction method of goat meat using factorial design and response surface methodology.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30658766,Food chemistry,2019 03 13,"Protein extraction from goat meat was carried out based on the combination of response surface methodology and factorial design to optimize the variables: temperature (25-50 °C), extraction time (8-20 min), volume (3-10 mL) and extractor concentration (0.05-0.1 mol L-1). The proposed model did not present a lack of fit, explaining 96% of the total data variance (R2 = 0.96). The optimum extraction conditions were: 0.05 mol L-1 for extractor concentration, extraction time of 10 min, temperature of 44 °C and extractor volume of 3.5 mL. The protein content (19.3 g/100 g) obtained by the optimized method was higher than some results reported in the literature. HPLC-SEC-DAD analysis revealed that the extraction conditions used did not significantly modify the protein structure. The proposed method proves to be simple, fast, robust, cheap and adequate for native protein extraction, being a potential approach for proteomic research focusing in goat meat.",Rapid detection of sulfaguanidine in fish by using a photonic crystal molecularly imprinted polymer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30658765,Food chemistry,2019 03 13,"A photonic crystal (PC) sensor was prepared through molecular imprinting by using dispersed SiO2 microspheres as PC, sulfaguanidine (SG) as template, methacrylic acid as monomer, and ethylene glycol dimethacrylate as crosslinker. The preparation conditions were optimized as follows: molar ratio of template, monomer, and crosslinker was 1:10:4; pH was 6.0 in phosphate buffer; and volume fraction of methanol was 15%. The relationship between wavelength shift of reflection peak and SG concentration was found as: Δλ = 7.8887 lg(C) + 79.9664. The response time was only 5 min. The limit of detection was 2.8 × 10-10 mol L-1. The sensor exhibited higher specificity for SG than its sulfonamide analogs. The sensor maintained original sensing performance after five cycles of usage. The recoveries of SG ranged from 93.8% to 111.2% in lake water and from 88.5% to 115.2% in fish samples.

Analysis of volatile compounds in fresh raw beef of differing lipid oxidation degrees.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30658764,Food chemistry,2019 03 13,"This work presents a headspace-solid phase microextraction-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (HS-SPME-GC-MS) method for the analysis of solid food samples in extended experiments. The final procedure was used to quantify 30 volatile compounds in fresh beef. The strategy adds robustness to the classic SPME methods for solid samples, by including a control solution that solves several challenges. The control solution contained one representative compound for each studied family of beef, and two internal standards. Response factors were calculated for each family, and were subsequently applied to every compound belonging to the same family. This strategy allowed control of the quantification procedure even when the fibre, column or control solution changed. Repeatability and reproducibility had relative standard deviation values below 17%, except for phenylacetaldehyde, (E)-2-nonenal and (E,Z)-2,4-decadienal.

The approach was based on the fact that the compounds and complex reagent interacted to form hydrophilic chelates under the effect of the separation voltage, which was effectively separated and detected by UV. Key parameters, such as the type and concentration of complex reagent, separation voltage and so on were systematically investigated. Under the optimized conditions, the precision and repeatability were in the range of 0.16-3.31% and 0.17-1.21%, respectively.

The present paper aimed to assess whether this can affect the kinetics of peptide release during digestion at the preterm stage. Raw (RHM) or pasteurized (PHM) human milk were digested in triplicates using an in vitro dynamic system. Mass spectrometry and multivariate statistics were conducted. Pre-proteolysis occurred mostly on β-casein, for which cumulative peptide abundance was significantly greater in PHM over 28% of the hydrolysed sequence. Eight clusters resumed the kinetics of peptide release during digestion, which differed on seven clusters (69% of the 1134 peptides). Clusters associated to the heat-denaturated proteins, lactoferrin and bile salt-stimulated lipase, presented different kinetics of release during digestion, unlike that for β-casein. Some bioactive peptides from β-casein presented significant different abundances between PHM and RHM before digestion (1-18, 185-211) or in during intestinal digestion (154-160, 161-166). Further physiological consequences should be investigated.","In vitro bioaccessibility of Al, Cu, Cd, and Pb following simulated gastro-intestinal digestion and total content of these metals in different Brazilian brands of yerba mate tea.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30658759,Food chemistry,2019 03 13,"Yerba mate tea contains various biochemically active substances. However, it can contain toxic metals. Thus, this work reports the total concentrations of Cd, Cu, Pb and Al in the commercial products, as well as the concentrations in infusions prepared. The bioaccessibility of these metals in these infusions was determined for the first time by in vitro digestion. For Al, its bioaccessibility was estimated in the presence of other ingredients used in tea consumption. In addition, the concentrations of phenolic compounds in infusions were also determined. All metals studied were detected in the samples ranging from 76 ng g-1 (Cd) to 526 µg g-1 (Al). In general, Cd and Cu were the most bioaccessible metals, while Al was found in a relatively inert form. The addition of sugar and honey in infusions decreased the Al bioaccessibility. The relationship between the phenolic and the leaching of Al for the beverages was observed."

All the four anthocyanins were successfully monoacylated, and their relative proportions did not affect the conversion yield. The acylation occurred at the 6″-OH position of the glucosides and at the rhamnose 4‴-OH of the rutinosides. The rutinoside moieties of the anthocyanins were successfully acylated for the first time, and the corresponding acylation sites were verified by NMR analysis. The acylation enhanced the lipophilicity. The hydrophilic anthocyanin rutinosides were more lipophilic after acylation. Introducing lauric acid into the anthocyanins significantly improved the thermostability and capacity to inhibit lipid peroxidation and maintained UV-vis absorbance and antioxidant activity. This research provides important insights into acylation of mixed anthocyanins with different glycosyl moieties.","Effects of sodium tripolyphosphate modification on the structural, functional, and rheological properties of rice glutelin.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30658746,Food chemistry,2019 03 13,"In this study, rice glutelin isolated from glutinous rice was modified by sodium tripolyphosphate at different sodium tripolyphosphate concentrations (1%, 4%, 7%). The structural, functional and rheological properties of phosphorylated rice glutelin were investigated. The results indicated that phosphorylated rice glutelin samples showed small particle size and high absolute zeta potential values. Phosphorylation reaction was occurred between -OH and -NH2 groups in rice glutelin and sodium tripolyphosphate, as confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The particle surface of phosphorylated rice glutelin samples became very rough and exhibited some small convex and concave holes. Moreover, the solubility, emulsifying and foaming properties, thermal stability and apparent viscosity of phosphorylated rice glutelin samples were significantly increased. These results suggest that the solubility, emulsification and rheological properties of rice glutelin are significantly improved after phosphorylation, which will be beneficial to expand the application of rice glutelin in food industry.","Comprehensive characterization of bioactive phenols from new Brazilian superfruits by LC-ESI-QTOF-MS, and their ROS and RNS scavenging effects and anti-inflammatory activity.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30658745,Food chemistry,2019 03 13,"Brazilian native fruits (BNF) remain unexplored and underutilized resources with a high potential to improve human health and wellness.

Eighty-six phenolic compounds were identified, including hydroxybenzoic acids, hydroxycinnamic acids, flavonoids, anthocyanins and ellagitannins, several of which had never been reported in BNF. The BNF exhibited high antioxidant effects against biologically relevant radicals, and treated animals showed decreased neutrophil influx and NF-kB activation. Thus, these BNF are good sources of antioxidant and anti-inflammatory molecules that can be beneficial for human health as functional foods.

Concomitantly, M4 demonstrated a 1.86-fold increase in kcat, resulting in a 1.78-fold increase in catalytic efficiency. Molecular dynamics simulation revealed diverse mechanisms underlying the effects of each mutation on thermostability and catalytic efficiency. These results suggest that key properties of glucose oxidase can be modified in vitro by laboratory evolution, which may have remarkable economic importance.","Comparative studies on ACE inhibition, degree of hydrolysis, antioxidant property and phenolic acid composition of hydrolysates derived from simulated in vitro gastrointestinal proteolysis of three thermally treated legumes.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30658742,Food chemistry,2019 03 13,"Three phenolic-rich legume varieties underwent in vitro simulated gastrointestinal proteolytic digestion after a wide range of thermal treatments. Total phenolic content (TPC), DPPH free radical scavenging activity (DPPH), degree of hydrolysis (DH), angiotensin-I converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity of hydrolysates showed significant differences among thermal treatments. TPC values of hydrolysates were significantly (p < 0.05) higher than their corresponding undigested counterparts. The DPPH values were significantly (p < 0.05) lower than their corresponding undigested counterparts. DH had no correlations (p > 0.05) with ACE inhibitory activity for all three legumes. When compared with undigested legumes, the simulated gastrointestinal tract proteolytic digestion induced marked changes not only in the content, but also in the type of individual free phenolic acids.

To discover the influence of thermal processing, extraction and assessment methods on potential allergenicity, protein was extracted by three methods or digested in the form of defatted peanut powder (DPP). The components of extracted allergens were analyzed using electrophoresis and mass spectrometry; the advanced structures (the secondary structure and the tertiary structure) were characterized through spectroscopies; the potential allergenicities were assessed by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), Biolayer interferometry (BLI) and KU812 cell degranulation assay. Results demonstrated that extraction influenced the allergenicity assessment significantly, and the assessment method was also important. The potential allergenicity of protein changed after processing, it increased after roasting, while decreased after boiling. Additionally, digested DPP combined with basophilic granulocyte degranulation model might be a good allergenicity assessment method.",Determination of vitamin B12 in four edible insect species by immunoaffinity and ultra-high performance liquid chromatography.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30658738,Food chemistry,2019 03 29,"Insects are rich in major nutrients, such as protein and fat.

Hence, this study reports on the development and validation of a method for the determination of vitamin B12 in mealworm (Tenebrio molitor larvae), cricket (Gryllus assimilis), grasshopper (Locusta migratoria) and cockroach (Shelfordella lateralis), using an ultra-high performance liquid chromatography approach with preliminary immunoaffinity chromatography sample preparation. The method was validated regarding linearity, specificity, accuracy and precision, as well as limits of detection/quantification, and was found to be satisfactory for the desired application. Found levels of vitamin B12 were 1.08 µg/100 g for mealworm, 2.88 µg/100 g for cricket, 0.84 µg/100 g for grasshopper, and 13.2 µg/100 g dry weight for cockroach, representing the first validated report on the content of vitamin B12 in edible insects. Observed interferences are likely caused by the presence of pseudovitamin B12."

The transmissibility of ethanol-induced liver disease has been demonstrated using faecal microbiota transfer in preclinical models. This technique has also led to improved survival in patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis, suggesting that changes in the composition and function of the gut microbiota are causatively linked to alcohol-related liver disease. A major mechanism by which gut microbiota influence the development of alcohol-related liver disease is through a leaky intestinal barrier. This permits translocation of viable bacteria and microbial products to the liver, where they induce and promote inflammation, as well as contribute to hepatocyte death and the fibrotic response. In addition, gut dysbiosis is associated with changes in the metabolic function of the intestinal microbiota, bile acid composition and circulation, immune dysregulation during onset and progression of alcohol-related liver disease. Findings from preclinical and human studies will be used to demonstrate how alcohol causes intestinal pathology and contributes to alcohol-related liver disease and how the latter is self-perpetuating. Additionally, we summarise the effects of untargeted treatment approaches on the gut microbiota, such as diet, probiotics, antibiotics and faecal microbial transplantation in alcohol-related liver disease. We further discuss how targeted approaches can restore intestinal homeostasis and improve alcohol-related liver disease. These approaches are likely to add to the therapeutic options for alcohol-related liver disease independently or in conjunction with steroids.",Inflammatory pathways in alcoholic steatohepatitis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30658726,Journal of hepatology,2019 02 06,"Inflammatory processes are primary contributors to the development and progression of alcoholic steatohepatitis (ASH), with severe alcoholic hepatitis characterised by non-resolving inflammation. Inflammation in the progression of ASH is a complex response to microbial dysbiosis, loss of barrier integrity in the intestine, hepatocellular stress and death, as well as inter-organ crosstalk. Herein, we review the roles of multiple cell types that are involved in inflammation in ASH, including resident macrophages and infiltrating monocytes, as well as other cell types in the innate and adaptive immune system. In response to chronic, heavy alcohol exposure, hepatocytes themselves also contribute to the inflammatory process; hepatocytes express a large number of chemokines and inflammatory mediators and can also release damage-associated molecular patterns during injury and death. These cellular responses are mediated and accompanied by changes in the expression of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, as well as by signals which orchestrate the recruitment of immune cells and activation of the inflammatory process. Additional mechanisms for cell-cell and inter-organ communication in ASH are also reviewed, including the roles of extracellular vesicles and microRNAs, as well as inter-organ crosstalk. We highlight the concept that inflammation also plays an important role in promoting liver repair and controlling bacterial infection. Understanding the complex regulatory processes that are disrupted during the progression of ASH will likely lead to better targeted strategies for therapeutic interventions.",Effect of ethanol on lipid metabolism.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30658725,Journal of hepatology,2019 06 10,"Hepatic lipid metabolism is a series of complex processes that control influx and efflux of not only hepatic lipid pools, but also organismal pools. Lipid homeostasis is usually tightly controlled by expression, substrate supply, oxidation and secretion that keep hepatic lipid pools relatively constant. However, perturbations of any of these processes can lead to lipid accumulation in the liver. Although it is thought that these responses are hepatic arms of the 'thrifty genome', they are maladaptive in the context of chronic fatty liver diseases. Ethanol is likely unique among toxins, in that it perturbs almost all aspects of hepatic lipid metabolism. This complex response is due in part to the large metabolic demand placed on the organ by alcohol metabolism, but also appears to involve more nuanced changes in expression and substrate supply. The net effect is that steatosis is a rapid response to alcohol abuse. Although transient steatosis is largely an inert pathology, the chronicity of alcohol-related liver disease seems to require steatosis. Better and more specific understanding of the mechanisms by which alcohol causes steatosis may therefore translate into targeted therapies to treat alcohol-related liver disease and/or prevent its progression.",Treating alcohol-related liver disease from a public health perspective.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30658724,Journal of hepatology,2019 01 19,"Herein, we describe the evolving landscape of alcohol-related liver disease (ALD) including the current global burden of disease and cost to working-aged people in terms of death and disability, in addition to the larger spectrum of alcohol-related heath complications and its wider impact on society. We further review the most effective and cost-effective public health policies at both a population and individual level. Currently, abstinence is the only effective treatment for ALD, and yet because the majority of ALD remains undetected in the community abstinence is initiated too late to prevent premature death in the majority of cases. We therefore hope that this review will help inform clinicians of the ""public health treatment options"" for ALD to encourage engagement with policy makers and promote community-based hepatology as a speciality, expanding our patient cohort to allow early detection, and thereby a reduction in the enormous morbidity and mortality associated with this disease.",Development and Validation of Spectrophotometric Methods for the Determination of Canagliflozin or Gliclazide and Metformin in the Presence of Metformin Impurity (1-Cyanoguanidine).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30658719,Journal of AOAC International,2019 01 19,"Background: Quantitative multicomponent analysis is considered an analytical goal to save time and cost in analysis. Objective: This work aimed to provide sensitive and selective [successive ratio subtraction coupled with constant multiplication (SRS-CM) and chemometric] methods for the determination of coformulated antidiabetic drugs, namely canagliflozine and metformin or gliclazide and metformin in presence of metformin degradation product, 1-cyanoguanidine. Methods: SRS-CM method was developed for the determination of canagliflozin and metformin at 292 and 237 nm, respectively, using 14 μg/mL canagliflozin as a divisor in the first step to cancel the spectrum of canagliflozin. Then, 18 μg/mL metformin was used as a divisor in the second step to cancel the spectrum of metformin. Finally, we obtained the spectrum of cyanoguanidine. Chemometric method was applied for the determination of the gliclazide and metformin mixture in a 225-235 nm range. Sample enrichment technique was used to increase the concentration of canagliflozin or gliclazide to allow its simultaneous determination with metformin without prior separation. Results: Validation parameters according to the International Conference on Harmonization guidelines were satisfactory over the concentration ranges of 5 to 16 μg/mL for canagliflozin and metformin as well as 2.5 to 12.5 and 6 to 24 μg/mL for gliclazide and metformin, respectively.

Thus, the Veterans Affairs (VA) Healthcare System developed the Stratification Tool for Opioid Risk Management (STORM), a dashboard to assist clinicians with opioid risk evaluation and mitigation. Updated daily, STORM calculates a ""risk score"" of adverse outcomes (e.g., suicide-related events, overdoses, overdose death) from variables in the VA medical record for all patients with an opioid prescription and displays this information along with documentation of recommended risk mitigation strategies and non-opioid pain treatments. In March 2018, the VA issued a policy notice requiring VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) to complete case reviews for patients whom STORM identifies as very high-risk (i.e., top 1% of STORM risk scores). Half of VAMCs were randomly assigned notices that also stated that additional support and oversight would be required for VAMCs that failed to meet an established percentage of case reviews. Using a stepped-wedge cluster randomized design, VAMCs will be further randomized to conduct case reviews for an expanded pool of patients (top 5% of STORM risk scores vs. 1%) starting either 9 or 15 months after the notice was released, creating four natural arms.

Beyond these connections, a substantial level of communication seems to occur between bone and other tissues, and together, they form an organic unit linked to human health and disease. However, the current hypothesis, which includes growth factors, hormones and specific protein secretion, incompletely explains the close connections among bone cells or between bone and other tissues. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are widely-distributed membrane structures consisting of lipid bilayers, membrane proteins and intravesicular cargo (including proteins and nucleic acids), ranging from 30 nm to 1000 nm in diameter, and their characters have been highly conserved throughout evolution. EVs have targeting abilities and the potential to transmit multidimensional, abundant and complicated information, as powerful and substantial ""dogrobbers"" mediating intercellular communications. As research has progressed, EVs have gradually become thought of as ""dogrobbers"" in bone tissue-the ""eternal battle field"" -in a delicate dynamic balance of destruction and reconstruction. In the current review, we give a brief description of the major constituent cells in bone tissues and explore the progress of current research on bone-derived EVs.

In the current study, four experiments were conducted to investigate whether bilingual comprehension experience influences executive functions. In Experiments 1 and 2, Chinese-English bilinguals completed a flanker task interleaved with a language comprehension task (reading comprehension in Experiment 1 and listening comprehension in Experiment 2). There were three blocks distinguished by language context, with a Chinese (L1) block, an English (L2) block, and a mixed (L1 and L2) block. Results showed that performance in the mixed block was better on both congruent and incongruent flanker trials when compared with the L1 and L2 blocks, indicating better monitoring functions overall.

Limited previous research suggests that such decoupling between policy and practice may be occurring in institutions of higher education (IHEs) when addressing sexual assault. The objective of this study was to test a measure designed to assess sexual assault policy implementation using the constructs of Institutional Theory. The measure was tested with a national sample of 210 staff and faculty at IHEs who work on sexual assault prevention and response on their campuses. This study assessed (a) the reliability of the measure; (b) the degree to which the measure identified legitimacy pressures and decoupling in the sample; (c) the degree to which legitimacy pressures were linked to decoupling in the sample, as the theory suggests; and (d) the degree to which campuses and individual characteristics were differentially associated with decoupling and legitimacy pressures. Principal factor analysis resulted in a factor structure that conformed reasonably well to the existing constructs of Institutional Theory, with the addition of a new construct reflecting an institution's stated commitment to addressing sexual assault. Regression analyses found that only normative legitimacy pressures significantly predicted decoupling and commitment. Higher decoupling scores were found for public campuses and larger institutions. Campus-based victim advocates reported significantly higher rates of decoupling than Title IX coordinators. The findings suggest that the process of policy implementation may vary across campus types and that further research is needed to better understand the impact of campus sexual assault regulatory attention.","Is Cannabis Use Associated with Sedentary Behavior during Leisure Time?

In Study 1, 227 men took part in a study on factors associated with knife-carrying. In Study 2, 200 participants took part in an experimental study on anti-knife slogans. In Study 3, 169 men took part in a study on existing anti-knife injury posters. In Study 4, 151 men took part in a study on anti-knife CGI posters featuring an avatar with different types of knife injury. Study 1 proposes a structural equation model that shows the intercorrelations between physical defense ability, limited trust in authority, limited control over one's status and the need for respect, and how they predict aggressive masculinity (i.e., macho culture), which, in turn, predicts knife-carrying tolerance. The model also reveals two significant latent factors: saving face inter-male competition (i.e., honor) and perceived social ecological constraints (i.e., socioeconomic limitations).

A consequence of this approach is a dramatic reduction in the spectral acquisition rate, which necessitates the use of additional instrument time to achieve comprehensive proteomic depth. This work assesses the performance and benefits of online and real-time spectral identification in quantitative multiplexed workflows. A Real-Time Search (RTS) algorithm was implemented to identify fragment spectra within milliseconds as they are acquired using a probabilistic score and to trigger quantitative spectra only upon confident peptide identification. The RTS-MS3 was benchmarked against standard workflows using a complex two-proteome model of interference and a targeted 10-plex comparison of kinase abundance profiles. Applying the RTS-MS3 method provided the comprehensive characterization of a 10-plex proteome in 50% less acquisition time.

This results in long calibration time that limits the BCI usage in practice. One major challenge in the development of a brain⁻computer interface is to reduce calibration time or completely eliminate it. To address this problem, existing approaches use covariance matrices of electroencephalography (EEG) trials as descriptors for decoding BCI but do not consider the geometry of the covariance matrices, which lies in the space of Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) matrices. This inevitably limits their performance. We focus on reducing calibration time by introducing SPD based classification approach. However, SPD-based classification has limited applicability in small training sets because the dimensionality of covariance matrices is large in proportion to the number of trials. To overcome this drawback, our paper proposes a new framework that transforms SPD matrices in lower dimension through spatial filter regularized by prior information of EEG channels. The efficacy of the proposed approach was validated on the small sample scenario through Dataset IVa from BCI Competition III. The proposed approach achieved mean accuracy of 86.13 % and mean kappa of 0.72 on Dataset IVa. The proposed method outperformed other approaches in existing studies on Dataset IVa. Finally, to ensure the robustness of the proposed method, we evaluated it on Dataset IIIa from BCI Competition III and Dataset IIa from BCI Competition IV.

Encoded by XPF/ERCC4, XPF provides the enzymatic activity of XPF-ERCC1 heterodimer, an endonuclease that incises at the 5' side of various DNA lesions. XPF is essential for nucleotide excision repair (NER) and interstrand crosslink repair (ICLR). XPF/ERCC4 mutations are associated with several human diseases: Xeroderma Pigmentosum (XP), Segmental Progeria (XFE), Fanconi Anemia (FA), Cockayne Syndrome (CS), and XP/CS combined disease (XPCSCD). Most affected individuals are compound heterozygotes for XPF/ERCC4 mutations complicating the identification of genotype/phenotype correlations. We report a detailed overview of NER and ICLR functional studies in human XPF-KO (knock-out) isogenic cells expressing six disease-specific pathogenic XPF amino acid substitution mutations. Ultraviolet (UV) sensitivity and unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) assays provide the most reliable information to discern mutations associated with ICLR impairment from mutations related to NER deficiency, whereas recovery of RNA synthesis (RRS) assays results hint to a possible role of XPF in resolving R-loops. Our functional studies demonstrate that a defined cellular phenotype cannot be easily correlated to each XPF mutation. Substituted positions along XPF sequences are not predictive of cellular phenotype nor reflect a particular disease. Therefore, in addition to mutation type, allelic interactions, protein stability and intracellular distribution of mutant proteins may also contribute to alter DNA repair pathways balance leading to clinically distinct disorders.",Yeast to Study Human Purine Metabolism Diseases.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30658520,Cells,2019 02 07,"Purine nucleotides are involved in a multitude of cellular processes, and the dysfunction of purine metabolism has drastic physiological and pathological consequences.

GM, which is also called ""the new virtual metabolic organ"", makes axis with a number of extraintestinal organs, such as kidneys, brain, cardiovascular, and the bone system. The gut-liver axis has attracted greater attention in recent years. GM communication is bi-directional and involves endocrine and immunological mechanisms. In this way, gut-dysbiosis and composition of ""ancient"" microbiota could be linked to pathogenesis of numerous chronic liver diseases such as chronic hepatitis B (CHB), chronic hepatitis C (CHC), alcoholic liver disease (ALD), non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), development of liver cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In this paper, we discuss the current evidence supporting a GM role in the management of different chronic liver diseases and potential new therapeutic GM targets, like fecal transplantation, antibiotics, probiotics, prebiotics, and symbiotics. We conclude that population-level shifts in GM could play a regulatory role in the gut-liver axis and, consequently, etiopathogenesis of chronic liver diseases.

Methods: This descriptive, cross-sectional study was conducted at the Jinnah and Sir Ganga Ram Hospitals, Lahore using convenience sampling techniques between 1 December 2015 and 28 February 2016. The sample consisted of elderly (>65 years) T2DM patients. Glycaemic values and patient characteristics were obtained from medical charts. Consenting patients were interviewed to complete the Barthel Index, Lawton Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Scale, Clinical Frailty Scale, Iowa Pain Thermometer Scale, Geriatric Depression Scale, Montreal Cognitive Assessment tool, Mini Nutritional Assessment Scale-Short Form and Self Care Inventory-Revised Version. Multiple logistic regression analysis was carried out to determine the predictors of poor glycaemic control. Results: A total of 490 patients were approached and 400 agreed to participate. Overall, nearly one-third (32.2%, n = 129) of patients had glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) at the target level. Fasting and random plasma glucose levels were within the target range to much the same extent; (36.8%, n = 147) and (27%, n = 108), respectively. HbA1c levels were also higher in patients with co-morbidities (67.4%, n = 229) with diabetes-related complications (73.5%, n = 227). Significant predictors of impaired glycaemic control (HbA1c) included poor diabetes self-care (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 0.96; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.95, 0.98), not being prescribed oral hypoglycaemic agents (OHA) (AOR 6.22; 95% CI 2.09, 18.46), regular hypoglycaemic attacks (AOR 2.53; 95% CI 1.34, 4.81) and falling tendency (AOR 0.19; 95% CI 0.10, 0.36). Conclusions: Poor glycaemic control prevailed among the majority of elderly Pakistani diabetic patients in this study.

Genome-wide analyses of CRK genes have been carried out in Arabidopsis and rice, while functional characterization of some CRKs has been carried out in wheat and tomato in addition to Arabidopsis. A comprehensive analysis of the CRK gene family in leguminous crops has not yet been conducted, and our understanding of their roles in symbiosis is rather limited. Here, we report the comprehensive analysis of the PhaseolusCRK gene family, including identification, sequence similarity, phylogeny, chromosomal localization, gene structures, transcript expression profiles, and in silico promoter analysis. Forty-six CRK homologs were identified and phylogenetically clustered into five groups. Expression analysis suggests that PvCRK genes are differentially expressed in both vegetative and reproductive tissues. Further, transcriptomic analysis revealed that shared and unique CRK genes were upregulated during arbuscular mycorrhizal and rhizobial symbiosis. Overall, the systematic analysis of the PvCRK gene family provides valuable information for further studies on the biological roles of CRKs in various Phaseolus tissues during diverse biological processes, including Phaseolus-mycorrhiza/rhizobia symbiosis.",The Gene Structure and Expression Level Changes of the GH3 Gene Family in Brassica napus Relative to Its Diploid Ancestors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30658516,Genes,2019 02 05,"The GH3 gene family plays a vital role in the phytohormone-related growth and developmental processes.

BnaGH3 genes were unevenly distributed on chromosomes with 39 on An and 27 on Cn, in which six BnaGH3 genes may appear as new genes. The whole genome triplication allowed the GH3 gene family to expand in diploid ancestors, and allopolyploidization made the GH3 gene family re-expand in B. napus. For most BnaGH3 genes, the exon-intron compositions were similar to diploid ancestors, while the cis-element distributions were obviously different from its ancestors. After allopolyploidization, the expression patterns of GH3 genes from ancestor species changed greatly in B. napus, and the orthologous gene pairs between An/Ar and Cn/Co had diverged expression patterns across four tissues. Our study provides a comprehensive analysis of the GH3 gene family in B. napus, and these results could contribute to identifying genes with vital roles in phytohormone-related growth and developmental processes.",Fluoropolymer-Containing Opals and Inverse Opals by Melt-Shear Organization.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30658515,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 08,"The preparation of highly ordered colloidal architectures has attracted significant attention and is a rapidly growing field for various applications, e.g., sensors, absorbers, and membranes. A promising technique for the preparation of elastomeric inverse opal films relies on tailored core/shell particle architectures and application of the so-called melt-shear organization technique. Within the present work, a convenient route for the preparation of core/shell particles featuring highly fluorinated shell materials as building blocks is described. As particle core materials, both organic or inorganic (SiO₂) particles can be used as a template, followed by a semi-continuous stepwise emulsion polymerization for the synthesis of the soft fluoropolymer shell material. The use of functional monomers as shell-material offers the possibility to create opal and inverse opal films with striking optical properties according to Bragg's law of diffraction. Due to the presence of fluorinated moieties, the chemical resistance of the final opals and inverse opals is increased. The herein developed fluorine-containing particle-based films feature a low surface energy for the matrix material leading to good hydrophobic properties. Moreover, the low refractive index of the fluoropolymer shell compared to the core (or voids) led to excellent optical properties based on structural colors. The herein described fluoropolymer opals and inverse opals are expected to pave the way toward novel functional materials for application in fields of coatings and optical sensors."
