Testing the use of autonomy-supportive language and the provision of choice in online computer-tailored alcohol reduction communication.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30834136,Digital health,2019 03 07,"Individuals can feel more motivated to change health behaviour when perceiving autonomy-support, as induced through non-pressuring message phrasing and the provision of choice: autonomy-supportive message framing. Additionally, controlling message phrasing - commands that do not provide choice - can thwart autonomy and lead to reactance, which is detrimental to the persuasiveness of health messages. Many health messages have not been formulated in an autonomy-supportive manner and therefore could arouse reactance, resulting in reduced intervention effectiveness. We aimed to test the effects of autonomy-supportive vs. controlling alcohol reduction message frames on individuals' perceived autonomy-support from these messages; and their reactance towards the message while considering the individual need for autonomy in the context of an online computer-tailored alcohol reduction intervention. A 2 (autonomy-supportive language vs. controlling language) × 2 (choice vs. no choice) between-subjects experiment (N = 521) was conducted using an online computer-tailored alcohol reduction intervention. Outcome measures were perceived autonomy-support and reactance and we investigated whether an individual's need for autonomy moderated the effect of autonomy-supportive and controlling message frames on those outcome variables. Multiple linear regression analyses showed that neither autonomy-supportive nor controlling message frames had significant effects on perceived autonomy-support or reactance, and there was no moderation from the need for autonomy. Overall, participants evaluated the intervention as positive and perceived high levels of autonomy-support, regardless of the message frame used. Future research needs to test whether the positive intervention evaluation is due to content tailoring, and whether more distinguishable manipulations of message frames could be effective.",A text messaging-based intervention to increase physical activity among persons living in permanent supportive housing: Feasibility and acceptability findings from a pilot study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30834135,Digital health,2019 03 07,"Persons who have experienced homelessness and are living in permanent supportive housing experience high rates of health and mental health problems.

With the progression of global climate change, high temperatures and hypoxia may co-occur more frequently within redds, particularly for salmonid species at their southern range limit. Warming and hypoxia have competing effects on energy supply and demand, which can be detrimental to energy-limited early life stages. We examined how elevated temperature and hypoxia as individual and combined stressors affected the survival, physiological performance, growth, and development of Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha). We reared late fall-run Chinook salmon from fertilization to the fry stage in a fully factorial design of two temperatures [10°C (ambient) and 14°C (warm)] and two oxygen levels [normoxia (100% air saturation, 10 mg O2/l) and hypoxia (50% saturation, 5.5 mg O2/l)]. Rearing in hypoxia significantly reduced hatching success, especially in combination with warming. Both warming and hypoxia improved acute thermal tolerance. While rearing in hypoxia improved tolerance to acute hypoxia stress, warming reduced hypoxia tolerance. Hypoxia-reared fish were smaller at hatch, but were able to reach similar sizes to the normoxia-reared fish by the fry stage. High temperature and normoxia resulted in the fastest rate of development while low temperature and hypoxia resulted in the slowest rate of development. Despite improved physiological tolerance to acute heat and hypoxia stress, hypoxia-reared embryos had reduced survival and growth, which could have larger population-level effects. These results suggest that both warming and hypoxia are important factors to address in conservation strategies for Chinook salmon.",The utility of neutrophil gelatinase-associated Lipocalin (NGAL) as a marker of acute kidney injury (AKI) in critically ill patients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30834123,Biomarker research,2019 03 07,"In current clinical practice, Serum Creatinine (SCr) is a commonly used marker for the diagnosis of acute kidney injury (AKI). Unfortunately, due to a delayed increase in SCr, it is unable to accurately estimate the timing of the injury. The purpose of this study was to assess the ability of plasma neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (pNGAL) to predict AKI in critically ill adult patients. The study was conducted at the Section of Chemical Pathology, Department of Pathology& Laboratory Medicine in collaboration with Department of Anesthesiology, at Aga Khan University Hospital in Karachi, Pakistan. Subjects in the age groups of18 to 60, that were admitted into the intensive care unit (ICU) with suspected sepsis were enrolled in this study.AKI was labeled by using Risk-Injury-Failure-loss-End Stage (RIFLE) criteria. Forty-eight patients, mean age being 46.5 ± 16.3, were recruited over a nine-month period. Multiple blood samples were collected from each patient at 12 h, 24 h, and 48 h. A total of 52.1% (n = 24) of ICU patients suspected of sepsis had developed AKI. Baseline characteristics of subjects with AKI were compared to those without AKI. Statistically significant difference was noted in gender (p-value< 0.05) and pNGAL (p-value< 0.001). However, no significant differences were seen with respect to age, in patients with and without AKI. The area under the curve (AUC) at12hr was 0.82 (95% CI 0.68-0.96) with a sensitivity of 70.8% and specificity of 90.9%.While AUCs at 24 h was 0.86(95% CI 0.74-0.97) with a sensitivity of 78.5% and specificity of 88.8%. Furthermore, there was a positive correlation between pNGAL and the length of ICU stay (r = 0.98). Non-survivors or expired patients had higher median pNGAL170 (202-117) ng/ml as compared to survivors 123(170-91) ng/ml. In conclusion, pNGAL is an early predictor of AKI in a heterogeneous adult ICU population. Plasma NGAL allows the diagnosis of AKI 48 h prior to a clinical diagnosis based on RIFLE criteria. Early identification of high-risk AKI in patients may allow earlier initiation of therapies and improve patient outcome.",Sero-prevalence of transfusion-transmittable infections and associated factors among blood donors in Eastern Ethiopia: an Institutional-based cross-sectional study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30834117,SAGE open medicine,2019 03 07,"Blood transfusion saves millions of lives each year globally.

Hepatic encephalopathy may be classified as covert (mild symptoms (e.g. lack of awareness)) or overt (moderate to severe symptoms (e.g. confusion or coma)), and symptoms may overlap with other neurologic conditions (e.g. epilepsy, stroke). Managing hepatic encephalopathy includes identifying and treating precipitating factors (e.g. dehydration). First-line treatment for patients with overt hepatic encephalopathy is typically lactulose; to reduce the risk of overt hepatic encephalopathy recurrence, lactulose plus the nonsystemic antibiotic rifaximin is recommended. Rifaximin reduced the risk of breakthrough overt hepatic encephalopathy by 58% versus placebo over 6 months (p < 0.001; 91% of patients in each group were on concomitant lactulose). However, neither pharmacologic hepatic encephalopathy treatment nor liver transplantation may completely reverse neurologic impairment in patients with hepatic encephalopathy. Additional neurologic considerations for patients with cirrhosis include preventing falls, as well as managing sleep-related issues, hyponatremia, and cerebral edema. Thus, monitoring neurologic impairment is an important component in the management of patients with cirrhosis.",Pigs receiving daily tailored diets using precision-feeding techniques have different threonine requirements than pigs fed in conventional phase-feeding systems.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30834113,Journal of animal science and biotechnology,2019 03 07,"There is large variation in amino acids requirements among pigs, hence feeding pigs individually with daily tailored diets or in groups with a single feed may require different levels of nutrients. Thus, the response to different threonine levels (70%, 85%, 100%, 115%, and 130% of the ideal threonine:lysine protein ratio of 0.65) was studied in growing pigs raised in a conventional group phase-feeding (GPF) system or fed individually using individual precision-feeding (IPF) techniques. In a 21-day trial, 110 barrows (25 ± 0.80 kg body weight) were housed in the same room and fed using electronic feeders. Five pigs per treatment were slaughtered at the end of the trial."

Most of the previous studies concerning AER are done in the conscious level. Little is known about the AER under the subliminal level. The present study was to investigate the AER at the different perceptual levels (i.e., explicitly and implicitly) simultaneously, and the associated neural differences using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Priming paradigm was adopted in which the inhibition or neutral words were used as primes and the negative picutres were used as targets. In the experiment, the duration time of priming words was manipulated at 33 or 50 ms in the implicit level and 3000 ms in the explicit level. The participants were required to make emotional valence rating of the negative pictures while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging scanning. The results showed that the participants experienced less negative emotion in inhibition words priming condition contrary to neutral words priming condition. Significant differences were also found in the left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex at the implicit and explicit AER. The findings of this study demonstrate that inhibition words can automatically and effectively reduce an individual's negative emotion experience, and left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex have been both implicated in self-control during AER.",Sex Categorization of Faces: The Effects of Age and Experience.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30834097,i-Perception,2019 03 07,"The face own-age bias effect refers to the better ability to recognize the face from one's own age compared with other age groups.

We examined 7- and 9-year-olds' and adults' ability to correctly categorize the sex of 7- and 9-year-olds and adult faces without external cues, such as hair. Results indicated that all ages easily classify the sex of adult faces. They succeeded in classifying the sex of child faces, but their performance was poorer than for adult faces. In adults, processing time increased, and a response bias (male response) was elicited for child faces. In children, response times remained constant, and no bias was observed. Experience with specific category of faces seems to offer some advantage in speed of processing. Overall, sex categorization is more challenging for child than for adult faces due to their reduced sexual dimorphic facial characteristics.",Effect of Decaffeinated Coffee-enriched Chlorogenic Acid on Blood Glucose Levels in Healthy Controls: A Systematic Review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30834096,International journal of preventive medicine,2019 03 07,"As an important group of health problems, glucose metabolism disorders are associated with a number of diseases as well as mortality rate. Recently, studies have demonstrated that the consumption of decaffeinated coffee-enriched chlorogenic acid (CGA) can reduce the risk of diabetes and blood glucose rise, while the results of some previous studies have shown an opposite effect. Hence, a systematic search was conducted based on literature search and appropriate keywords through PubMed, Google Scholar, Web of Knowledge, Science direct, Medline, Cochrane, and Scopus databases from 2003 to 2018. After searching, 1593 articles were found. Then, we excluded papers based on the duplication and relevant for title and abstract, whereas 25 relevant articles remained for checking eligibility criteria. Since only randomized clinical trials studies (RCTs) could be included in the current study, six RCTs remained in end-stage for qualitative synthesis. The results of reviewed studies showed no significant effect of decaffeinated coffee-enriched CGA on blood glucose concentration. Although recent studies have suggested the effectiveness of decaffeinated coffee-enriched CGA on blood glucose in animals, and there are various mechanisms for this effect, and the result of our review showed that there is not sufficient evidence for this claim in healthy humans. Hence, further research in this area seems necessary.",Comparative virulotyping and phylogenomics of Escherichia coli isolates from urine samples of men and women suffering urinary tract infections.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30834088,Iranian journal of basic medical sciences,2019 03 07,Escherichia coli strains are common pathogens that can cause urinary tract infections (UTI).

The study surveyed viruses, bacteria, macroparasites and unicellular eukaryotes (protozoa). Fifty-three different infectious agents, all with zoonotic potential, were reported to be carried by commensal rats; 48 by the brown rat (Rattus norvegicus) and 20 by the black rat (R. rattus). There was a tendency for rural areas to harbour more rat-borne microbes than urban areas regarding the brown rat, but the opposite could be observed for the black rat. The study clearly indicated that an improved surveillance on wild rats is needed in Europe, and further indicated the pathogens and geographical areas where the major focus is required. For example, six zoonotic microbes seemed to be clearly more geographically widespread in Europe than others; virulent or resistant E. coli, pathogenic Leptospira spp., Hymenolepis diminuta, H. nana, Capillaria hepatica and Toxoplasma gondii.",Evidence of chikungunya virus infection among febrile patients seeking healthcare in selected districts of Tanzania.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30834070,Infection ecology & epidemiology,2019 03 07,"Introduction: Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) infection is an emerging mosquito-borne disease that has been associated with frequent epidemics in the world. However, there is a dearth of information on its magnitude and associated risk factors in Tanzania. Objective: A study was conducted to determine seroprevalence of CHIKV among febrile patients seeking medical care at health facilities in Karagwe, Sengerema, Kilombero and Kyela districts. Methods: Structured questionnaires were administered and 728 serum samples were collected between May and June, 2015 and tested for the presence of CHIKV-IgM and IgG-specific antibodies using Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results and discussion: The common clinical characteristics exhibited by outpatients were fever, headache and joint pains (100%, 70%, and 68.3% respectively). Out of 728 outpatients screened for CHIKV, 105 (14%) tested CHIKV IgG positive whilst 11 (1.5%) tested CHIKV IgM positive. Chikungunya seropositivity was significantly higher than previously reported in Tanzania. The most affected age group was 20-29 years. Our results indicate that CHIKV infection is prevalent and contributes to the burden of febrile illnesses in Tanzania. The seroprevalence varies between districts, reflecting variation in mosquito vector transmission dynamics in different parts of the country.

However, no global estimates of war survivors suffering from PTSD and/or MD in absolute numbers have been reported. Objective: We made the first attempt to estimate in absolute numbers how many adult war survivors globally may suffer PTSD and/or MD, which should inform local and global mental health programmes. Method: Drawing on the Uppsala Conflict Database, we reviewed all countries that suffered at least one war within their own territory between 1989 and 2015 (time span chosen on availability of geo-referenced data and population estimates). We then conducted a meta-analysis of current randomized epidemiological surveys on prevalence of PTSD and/or MD among war survivors. Finally, we extrapolated our results from the meta-analysis on the global population of adult war survivors by means of using general population data from the United Nations. Results: We estimate that about 1.45 billion individuals worldwide have experienced war between 1989 and 2015 and were still alive in 2015, including one billion adults. On the basis of our meta-analysis, we estimate that about 354 million adult war survivors suffer from PTSD and/or MD. Of these, about 117 million suffer from comorbid PTSD and MD. Conclusions: Based on the slim available evidence base, the global number of adult war survivors suffering PTSD and/or MD is vast. Most war survivors live in low-to-middle income countries with limited means to handle the enormous mental health burden. Since representative high quality data is lacking from most of these countries, our results contain a large margin of uncertainty and should be interpreted with caution.",Diversity and functional analysis of salivary microflora of Indian Antarctic expeditionaries.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30834068,Journal of oral microbiology,2019 03 07,"Introduction: The human oral microbiota continues to change phenotype by many factors (environment, diet, genetics, stress, etc.), throughout life with a major impact on human physiology, psychology, metabolism and immune system. Amongst one such factor with unique and extreme environmental conditions is Antarctica. The sea voyage to Antarctica has many risks than at station for expedition members. In this study, we investigated the influence of Antarctic sea voyage and stay at the Indian Antarctic station Maitri, on the health of Indian expedition members by using a metagenomic approach to explore oral biodiversity. Methods: Saliva samples were collected from 12 expedition members, at 3 different time points viz. before the start of the ship voyage, after the completion of the voyage and at the end of the stay at Antarctica. Samples were analyzed for whole genome and 16S rRNA sequencing. Result: The oral microbial diversity of the expedition members was significantly changed, during the days of sailing and after the stay at Antarctica. The oral microbiota comprised mainly of the phyla Firmicutes (46%, 29% & 36%); Proteobacteria (40%, 48%, & 44%), Bacteroidetes (10%, 22%, &14%), Fusobacterium and Actinobacteria (5%-1%) and Unclassified (17%, 25% & 23%), at three time points, respectively. Further, the differential analysis of microbes across all the phyla revealed 89, 157 and 157 OTUs genera. The altered microbiota indicated changes in amino acid, lipid and carbohydrate metabolism. Conclusion: Study suggests that understanding the compositional and functional differences in the oral microbiota of Antarctic expedition members, can lay the foundation to relate these differences to their health status.

This review discusses major changes to MS clinical trials in the era of DMTs. As treatment options for MS continue to increase, patients in modern MS trials present earlier and with milder disease compared with historic MS populations. While placebo-controlled trials for some questions may still be relevant, DMT trials in relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) are no longer ethical. The replacement of the placebo arm by an active comparator arm in trials have raised the cost of trials by requiring larger sample sizes to detect on-study changes in treatment effects. Efforts to improve trial efficiency in RRMS have focused on exploring adaptive designs and relying on sensitive magnetic resonance imaging measures of disease activity. In trials for progressive forms of MS (PMS), the lack of sensitive outcome measures that can be used in shorter-term trials have delayed the development of effective treatments. Recent shifting of the focus to advancing trials in PMS has identified paraclinical outcome measurements with improved potential, and the testing of agents for neuroprotection and remyelination is in progress.",Accuracy of the new rapid test for monitoring adalimumab levels.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833984,Therapeutic advances in gastroenterology,2019 03 07,"The loss of response to adalimumab (ADL) has been related to low serum concentrations at trough.

When an airway emergency develops, immediate access to difficult airway equipment is critical for implementation of rescue strategies. Previously, national expert consensus guidelines have provided only limited guidance for the design and setup of a difficult airway trolley. The overarching aim of the current work was to create a dedicated difficult airway trolley (for patients>12 years old) for use in anesthesia theatres, intensive care units, and emergency departments. A systematic literature search was performed, using the PubMed, Embase, and Google Scholar search engines. Based on evidence presented in 11 national or international guidelines, and peer-reviewed journals, we present and outline a difficult airway trolley organized to accommodate sequential progression through a four-step difficult airway algorithm. The contents of the top four drawers correspond to specific steps in the airway algorithm (A = intubation, B = oxygenation via a supraglottic airway device, C = facemask ventilation, and D = emergency invasive airway access). Additionally, specialized airway equipment may be included in the fifth drawer of the proposed difficult airway trolley, thus enabling widespread use. A logically designed, guideline-based difficult airway trolley is a vital resource for any clinician involved in airway management and may aid the adherence to difficult airway algorithms during evolving airway emergencies. Future research examining the availability of rescue airway devices in various clinical settings, and simulation studies comparing different types of difficult airway trolleys, are encouraged.",Antipathogenic Potential of a Polyherbal Wound-Care Formulation (Herboheal) against Certain Wound-Infective Gram-Negative Bacteria.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833966,Advances in pharmacological sciences,2019 03 07,"This study investigated antipathogenic efficacy of a polyherbal wound-healing formulation Herboheal against three multidrug-resistant strains of gram-negative bacterial pathogens associated with wound infections. Herboheal was evaluated for its quorum-modulatory potential against three different human-pathogenic bacteria, first in vitro through the broth dilution assay and then in vivo in the model host Caenorhabditis elegans. Herboheal at ≥0.1% v/v was able to inhibit (19-55%) in vitro production of quorum sensing-regulated pigments in all these bacteria and seemed to interfere with bacterial quorum sensing by acting as a signal-response inhibitor. This formulation could compromise haemolytic activity of all three bacteria by ∼18-69% and induced their catalase activity by ∼8-21%. Herboheal inhibited P. aeruginosa biofilm formation up to 40%, reduced surface hydrophobicity of P. aeruginosa cells by ∼9%, and also made them (25%) more susceptible to lysis by human serum. Antibiotic susceptibility of all three bacteria was modulated owing to pretreatment with Herboheal. Exposure of these test pathogens to Herboheal (≥0.025% v/v) effectively reduced their virulence towards the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Repeated subculturing of P. aeruginosa on the Herboheal-supplemented growth medium did not induce resistance to Herboheal in this mischievous pathogen, and this polyherbal extract was also found to exert a post-extract effect on P. aeruginosa, wherein virulence of the Herboheal-unexposed daughter cultures, of the Herboheal-exposed parent culture, was also found to be attenuated. Overall, this study indicates Herboheal formulation to be an effective antipathogenic preparation and validates its indicated traditional therapeutic use as a wound-care formulation.",Effect of a Novel Patient Garment on Perceived Privacy during Colonoscopy: A Simple Approach to Minimize Embarrassment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833965,Gastroenterology research and practice,2019 06 10,"In the United States, patients wear a one-piece, reusable cloth gown during colonoscopy procedures.

The learning properties of the system have been challenged in a classic cerebellum-driven paradigm, a perturbed upper limb reaching protocol. The neurophysiological principles used to develop the model succeeded in driving an adaptive motor control protocol with baseline, acquisition, and extinction phases. The spiking neural network model showed learning behaviours similar to the ones experimentally measured with human subjects in the same task in the acquisition phase, while resorted to other strategies in the extinction phase. The model processed in real-time external inputs, encoded as spikes, and the generated spiking activity of its output neurons was decoded, in order to provide the proper correction on the motor actuators. Three bidirectional long-term plasticity rules have been embedded for different connections and with different time scales. The plasticities shaped the firing activity of the output layer neurons of the network. In the perturbed upper limb reaching protocol, the neurorobot successfully learned how to compensate for the external perturbation generating an appropriate correction. Therefore, the spiking cerebellar model was able to reproduce in the robotic platform how biological systems deal with external sources of error, in both ideal and real (noisy) environments.",Combinatorial Pattern of Histone Modifications in Exon Skipping Event.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833963,Frontiers in genetics,2019 03 07,"Histone modifications are associated with alternative splicing.

Distinct combinatorial patterns of histone modifications that illustrating their casual relationships were observed in excluded/included exons and the surrounding intronic regions. The Bayesian networks also indicate that some histone modifications directly correlate with RNA splicing.

Herein, we present the characteristics of small mutations in Chinese patients with dystrophinopathies, and explore genotype-phenotype correlations. In our cohort, 115 patients with small mutations (18.49% of all patients) were included and DMD mutations were detected by either Sanger (53.91%) or next generation sequencing (46.09%). In total, 106 small mutations were detected, 28 of which (26.42%) had not been reported previously. The most common mutations were nonsense mutations (52.17%), followed by splicing (24.35%), frameshift (17.39%), and missense mutations (5.22%), in addition to a single untranslated region mutation (0.87%). We discovered distinct mutation characteristics in our patients, such as different positional distributions, indicating different exon skipping therapy strategies for small mutations in Chinese patients. Almost all patients (96.51%) with truncating or missense mutations, were covered by triple/double/single-exon skipping therapy; the most frequent single-exon skipping strategy was skipping exon 32, applicable for 8.51% of patients. Furthermore, splicing classification grades were correlated with phenotypes in nonsense mutations (P < 0.001), and serum creatinine levels differed significantly between DMD/IMD and BMD for patients ≤ 16 years old (P = 0.002). These observations can further aid prognostic judgment and guide treatment. In conclusion, the mutation characteristics and genotype-phenotype correlations in Chinese patients with dystrophinopathies and small mutations could provide insights into the molecular mechanisms of pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment designs.","Dynamic DNA Methylation During Aging: A ""Prophet"" of Age-Related Outcomes.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833961,Frontiers in genetics,2019 03 07,"The biological markers of aging used to predict physical health status in older people are of great interest. Telomere shortening, which occurs during the process of cell replication, was initially considered a promising biomarker for the prediction of age and age-related outcomes (e.g., diseases, longevity). However, the high instability in detection and low correlation with age-related outcomes limit the extension of telomere length to the field of prediction. Currently, a growing number of studies have shown that dynamic DNA methylation throughout human lifetime exhibits strong correlation with age and age-related outcomes. Indeed, many researchers have built age prediction models with high accuracy based on age-dependent methylation changes in certain CpG loci. For now, DNA methylation based on epigenetic clocks, namely epigenetic or DNA methylation age, serves as a new standard to track chronological age and predict biological age. Measures of age acceleration (Δage, DNA methylation age - chronological age) have been developed to assess the health status of a person. In addition, there is evidence that an accelerated epigenetic age exists in patients with certain age-related diseases (e.g., Alzheimer's disease, cardiovascular disease). In this review, we provide an overview of the dynamic signatures of DNA methylation during aging and emphasize its practical utility in the prediction of various age-related outcomes."

APs provide information about plethora of environmental cues. Salinity stress is critical for plants and impacts on excitability. The AP of brackish Characeae Nitellopsis obtusa, obtained in artificial pond water (APW) and under osmotic stress of 90 or 180 mM sorbitol APW or saline stress of 50 or 100 mM NaCl APW, were simulated by the Thiel-Beilby model (Beilby and Al Khazaaly, 2016). The model is based on a paradigm from animal systems, featuring the second messenger inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) mediating the opening of Ca2+ channels on internal stores. In plants the IP3 receptors have not been identified, so other second messengers might translate the threshold plasma membrane depolarization to Ca2+ release. The increased Ca2+ concentration in the cytoplasm activates Cl- channels, which lead to the depolarizing phase of the AP. The repolarization to normal resting potential difference (PD) results from the Ca2+ being re-sequestered by the Ca2+ pumps, the closure of the Cl- channels, efflux of K+ through the depolarization-activated outward rectifier channels and the continuing activity of the proton pump. The Nitellopsis AP form is longer in APW compared to that of Chara, with more gradual repolarization. The tonoplast component of the AP is larger than that in Chara australis. The plasma membrane AP is prolonged by the exposure to saline to a ""rectangular"" shape, similar to that in Chara. However, the changes are more gradual, allowing more insight into the mechanism of the process. It is possible that the cells recover the original AP form after prolonged exposure to brackish conditions. Some cells experience tonoplast APs only. As in Chara, the proton pump is transiently inhibited by the high cytoplasmic Ca2+ and gradually declines in saline media. However, if the cells are very hyperpolarized at the start of the experiment, the pump inhibition both by the AP and by the saline medium is mitigated. The model parameters and their changes with salinity are comparable to those in Chara.","Phenotyping and Genotype × Environment Interaction of Resistance to Leaffolder, Cnaphalocrocis medinalis Guenee (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) in Rice.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833948,Frontiers in plant science,2019 03 07,"Rice leaffolder, Cnaphalocrocis medinalis is one of the key foliage feeding insects of great concern throughout Asia as it results in significant yield losses. High visibility of damage is triggering farmers to apply toxic pesticides for its management. Therefore, it is vital to identify new stable sources of resistance for leaffolder. Phenotyping of 160 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) of a cross between a resistant parent, W1263 and a susceptible parent, TN1 using a rapid field screening method for three seasons resulted in identification of nine RILs as stable sources of resistance to rice leaffolder. Phenotypic frequency distributions were found continuous indicating that the resistance is a quantitative trait governed by polygenes. Phenotypic data for three seasons were analyzed using Genotype and Genotype × Environment Interaction (GGE) analysis for identification of stable resistant lines. Additive main effect and multiplicative interaction (AMMI) analysis showed that 86.41% of the total sum of square of damaged leaf area was attributed to genotype (GEN) effect; 0.48% to environment (ENV) effects and 5.68% to genotype by environment (G × E) interaction effects. Damage area, damage score and leaf length showed very high broad-sense heritability across three environments. However, leaf width had low heritability indicating higher environment influence. Phylogenetic analysis grouped these 160 RILs and parents into five clusters based on resistant reaction. AMMI and GGE biplot analysis revealed that stable genotypes G8 (MP114) and G3 (MP108) with lower damage area and damage score can be utilized in developing cultivars with leaffolder resistance.",Comparative Extracellular Proteomics of Aeromonas hydrophila Reveals Iron-Regulated Secreted Proteins as Potential Vaccine Candidates.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833947,Frontiers in immunology,2019 03 07,"In our previous study, several iron-related outer membrane proteins in Aeromonas hydrophila, a serious pathogen of farmed fish, conferred high immunoprotectivity to fish, and were proposed as potential vaccine candidates. However, the protective efficacy of these extracellular proteins against A. hydrophila remains largely unknown. Here, we identified secreted proteins that were differentially expressed in A. hydrophila LP-2 in response to iron starvation using an iTRAQ-based quantitative proteomics method. We identified 341 proteins, of which 9 were upregulated in response to iron starvation and 24 were downregulated. Many of the differently expressed proteins were associated with protease activity. We confirmed our proteomics results with Western blotting and qPCR. We constructed three mutants by knocking out three genes encoding differentially expressed proteins (Δorf01830, Δorf01609, and Δorf03641). The physiological characteristics of these mutants were investigated. In all these mutant strains, protease activity decreased, and Δorf01609, and Δorf01830 were less virulent in zebrafish. This indicated that the proteins encoded by these genes may play important roles in bacterial infection. We next evaluated the immune response provoked by the six iron-related recombinant proteins (ORF01609, ORF01830, ORF01839, ORF02943, ORF03355, and ORF03641) in zebrafish as well as the immunization efficacy of these proteins. Immunization with these proteins significantly increased the zebrafish immune response. In addition, the relative percent survival (RPS) of the immunized zebrafish was 50-80% when challenged with three virulent A. hydrophila strains, respectively. Thus, these extracellular secreted proteins might be effective vaccine candidates against A. hydrophila infection in fish.",Pro-inflammatory Cytokines Alter the Immunopeptidome Landscape by Modulation of HLA-B Expression.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833945,Frontiers in immunology,2019 03 07,"Antigen presentation on HLA molecules is a major mechanism by which the immune system monitors self and non-self-recognition. Importantly, HLA-I presentation has gained much attention through its role in eliciting anti-tumor immunity. Several determinants controlling the peptides presented on HLA have been uncovered, mainly through the study of model substrates and large-scale immunopeptidome analyses. These determinants include the relative abundances of proteins in the cell, the stability or turnover rate of these proteins and the binding affinities of a given peptide to the HLA haplotypes found in a cell. However, the regulatory principles involved in selection and regulation of specific antigens in response to tumor pro-inflammatory signals remain largely unknown. Here, we chose to examine the effect that TNFα and IFNγ stimulation may exert on the immunopeptidome landscape of lung cancer cells. We show that the expression of many of the proteins involved in the class I antigen presentation pathway are changed by pro-inflammatory cytokines. Further, we could show that increased expression of the HLA-B allomorph drives a significant change in HLA-bound antigens, independently of the significant changes observed in the cellular proteome. Finally, we observed increased HLA-B levels in correlation with tumor infiltration across the TCGA lung cancer cohorts. Taken together, our results suggest that the immunopeptidome landscape should be examined in the context of anti-tumor immunity whereby signals in the microenvironment may be critical in shaping and modulating this important aspect of host-tumor interactions.",Human Mast Cells From Adipose Tissue Target and Induce Apoptosis of Breast Cancer Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833944,Frontiers in immunology,2019 03 08,"Mast cells (MC) are important immune sentinels found in most tissue and widely recognized for their role as mediators of Type I hypersensitivity. However, they also secrete anti-cancer mediators such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). The purpose of this study was to investigate adipose tissue as a new source of MC in quantities that could be used to study MC biology focusing on their ability to bind to and kill breast cancer cells. We tested several cell culture media previously demonstrated to induce MC differentiation. We report here the generation of functional human MC from adipose tissue. The adipose-derived mast cells (ADMC) are phenotypically and functionally similar to connective tissue expressing tryptase, chymase, c-kit, and FcεRI and capable of degranulating after cross-linking of FcεRI. The ADMC, sensitized with anti-HER2/neu IgE antibodies with human constant regions (trastuzumab IgE and/or C6MH3-B1 IgE), bound to and released MC mediators when incubated with HER2/neu-positive human breast cancer cells (SK-BR-3 and BT-474). Importantly, the HER2/neu IgE-sensitized ADMC induced breast cancer cell (SK-BR-3) death through apoptosis. Breast cancer cell apoptosis was observed after the addition of cell-free supernatants containing mediators released from FcεRI-challenged ADMC. Apoptosis was significantly reduced when TNF-α blocking antibodies were added to the media. Adipose tissue represents a source MC that could be used for multiple research purposes and potentially as a cell-mediated cancer immunotherapy through the expansion of autologous (or allogeneic) MC that can be targeted to tumors through IgE antibodies recognizing tumor specific antigens.",Elevated Soluble PD-L1 in Pregnant Women's Serum Suppresses the Immune Reaction.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833943,Frontiers in immunology,2019 03 07,"Background: Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) is expressed not only on some cancer cells, but also on the outer surface of placental syncytiotrophoblasts, which is assumed to induce maternal immune tolerance to fetal tissue via programmed death-1 (PD-1) receptors on T cells. Recently, levels of soluble forms of PD-L1 (sPD-L1) were reported to be higher in the serum of pregnant women (PW) than in non-pregnant women (non-PW). However, there have been no reports of the functional significance of PW's serum containing high sPD-L1 levels. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to clarify the role of sPD-L1 in the sera of PW as an immunosuppressive molecule by in vitro assays. Methods: As a post-hoc analysis of our previous cohort study, 330 pairs of serum from PW during the third trimester and cord blood (CB) from paired offspring without major complications were examined. Serum levels of sPD-L1 and sPD-1 were measured by ELISA. On mixed lymphocyte culture (MLC), 3H-thymidine uptakes in the presence of PW's, offspring's, or non-PW's serum were compared. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were cultured in the presence of PW's serum stimulated with PHA, and then cytokine levels were measured in supernatants by multiple cytokine analysis with or without anti-PD-L1blocking antibody. Results: The median sPD-L1 level was 8.3- and 6.9-fold higher in PW than in offspring and non-PW, respectively, whereas sPD-1 levels were lower in PW and offspring than in non-PW. On MLC, 3H-thymidine uptake in the presence of autoantigen was strongly reduced by co-culture with serum of both PW and offspring, compared with serum of non-PW. In contrast, uptake in the presence of alloantigen was moderately inhibited by PW's serum, whereas it was less suppressed by offspring's serum, compared with non-PW's serum. In the culture of PBMCs, tumor necrosis factor-α, interferon gamma, interleukin (IL)-2, and IL-4 levels were significantly higher in the presence of anti-PD-L1 blocking antibody than in culture not treated with antibody (all P < 0.05) or culture treated with isotype control antibody (all P < 0.05). Conclusion: The levels of sPD-L1 are elevated in PW's serum, which may, at least in part, suppress maternal immunity.",The Association Between Documentation of Koplik Spots and Laboratory Diagnosis of Measles and Other Rash Diseases in a National Measles Surveillance Program in Japan.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833942,Frontiers in microbiology,2019 03 07,"Koplik spots are considered a disease-specific sign for measles, although comprehensive virological studies have not been conducted to date. In Japan, a national survey of 3023 measles and measles-suspected cases was conducted between 2009 and 2014 using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) to detect various rash/fever-associated viruses. Koplik spots were observed in 717 of 3023 cases (23.7%). Among these, the measles virus was detected in 202 cases (28.2%), while the rubella virus was detected in 125 cases (17.4%). Other viruses were detected in 51 cases having the spots (7.1%). In some of the cases with spots, two or three viruses, such as the rubella virus, parvovirus, and human herpesvirus type 6 were also detected. The sensitivity and specificity of Koplik spots as a diagnostic marker for measles were 48 and 80%, respectively. The results suggested that Koplik spots might appear not only in measles but also in other viral infections, such as rubella, as a clinical sign.",Molecular Characteristics and Antimicrobial Resistance of Group B Streptococcus Strains Causing Invasive Disease in Neonates and Adults.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833941,Frontiers in microbiology,2019 03 07,"We aimed to analyze the molecular characteristics, clonality and antimicrobial resistance profiles of group B streptococcus (GBS) isolates collected in Taiwan from invasive diseases and carriage. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) was used to assess the genetic diversity of 225 GBS strains from neonates and adults with invasive GBS diseases. 100 GBS strains collected from colonized pregnant women during the same period were compared, and all strains were characterized for one of nine capsule genotypes. We also determined the susceptibilities of all GBS isolates to various antimicrobial agents. The most frequently identified serotypes that caused invasive disease in neonates were III (60.6%) and Ia (17.3%), whereas type VI (32.7%), Ib (19.4%), and V (19.4%) were the most common to cause invasive disease in adults. Serotype VI was the leading type that colonized pregnant women (35.0%). Twenty-six sequence types (STs) were identified, and 90.5% of GBS strains were represented by 6 STs. ST-17 and ST-1 were more prevalent in invasive diseases in neonates and adults, respectively. The majority of serotype III and VI isolates belonged to clonal complex (CC)-17 and CC-1, respectively. ST-17 strains were more likely to cause meningitis and late-onset disease than other strains. In addition, ST-12 and ST-17 GBS strains showed the highest rate of resistance to erythromycin and clindamycin (range: 75.8-100%). In conclusion, CC-17/type III and CC-1/type VI are the most important invasive pathogens in infants and non-pregnant adults in Taiwan, respectively. GBS genotypes vary between different age groups and geographical areas and should be considered during GBS vaccine development.","Combined Metabarcoding and Co-occurrence Network Analysis to Profile the Bacterial, Fungal and Fusarium Communities and Their Interactions in Maize Stalks.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833940,Frontiers in microbiology,2019 03 07,"Fusarium Head Blight (FHB) is one of the most devastating diseases of cereals worldwide, threatening both crop production by affecting cereal grain development, and human and animal health by contaminating grains with mycotoxins. Despite that maize residues constitute the primary source of inoculum for Fusarium pathogenic species, the structure and diversity of Fusarium spp. and microbial communities in maize residues have received much less attention than in grains. In this study, a metabarcoding approach was used to study the bacterial, fungal and Fusarium communities encountered in maize stalks collected from 8 fields in Brittany, France, after maize harvest during fall 2015. Some predominant genera found in maize residues were cereal or maize pathogens, such as the fungal Fusarium, Acremonium, and Phoma genera, and the bacterial Pseudomonas and Erwinia genera. Furthermore, a high predominance of genera with previously reported biocontrol activity was found, including the bacterial Sphingomonas, Pedobacter, Flavobacterium, Pseudomonas, and Janthinobacterium genera; and the fungal Epicoccum, Articulospora, Exophiala, and Sarocladium genera. Among Fusarium spp., F. graminearum and F. avenaceum were dominant. We also found that the maize cultivar and previous crop could influence the structure of microbial communities. Using SparCC co-occurrence network analysis, significant negative correlations were obtained between Fusarium spp. responsible for FHB (including F. graminearum and F. avenaceum) and bacterial OTUs classified as Sphingomonas and fungal OTUs classified as Sarocladium and Epicoccum. Considering that isolates belonging to these taxa have already been associated with antagonist effect against different Fusarium spp. and/or other pathogenic microorganisms and due to their predominance and negative associations with Fusarium spp., they may be good candidates as biocontrol agents. Combining the use of Fusarium-specific primers with universal primers for bacteria and fungi allowed us to study the microbial communities, but also to track correlations between Fusarium spp. and other bacterial and fungal genera, using co-occurrence network analysis. Such approach could be a useful tool as part of a screening strategy for novel antagonist candidates against toxigenic Fusarium spp., allowing the selection of taxa of interest.",Differential View on the Bile Acid Stress Response of Clostridioides difficile.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833939,Frontiers in microbiology,2019 03 07,"Clostridioides difficile is an intestinal human pathogen that uses the opportunity of a depleted microbiota to cause an infection. It is known, that the composition of the intestinal bile acid cocktail has a great impact on the susceptibility toward a C. difficile infection. However, the specific response of growing C. difficile cells to diverse bile acids on the molecular level has not been described yet. In this study, we recorded proteome signatures of shock and long-term (LT) stress with the four main bile acids cholic acid (CA), chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), deoxycholic acid (DCA), and lithocholic acid (LCA). A general overlapping response to all tested bile acids could be determined particularly in shock experiments which appears plausible in the light of their common steroid structure. However, during LT stress several proteins showed an altered abundance in the presence of only a single or a few of the bile acids indicating the existence of specific adaptation mechanisms. Our results point at a differential induction of the groEL and dnaKJgrpE chaperone systems, both belonging to the class I heat shock genes. Additionally, central metabolic pathways involving butyrate fermentation and the reductive Stickland fermentation of leucine were effected, although CA caused a proteome signature different from the other three bile acids. Furthermore, quantitative proteomics revealed a loss of flagellar proteins in LT stress with LCA. The absence of flagella could be substantiated by electron microscopy which also indicated less flagellated cells in the presence of DCA and CDCA and no influence on flagella formation by CA. Our data break down the bile acid stress response of C. difficile into a general and a specific adaptation. The latter cannot simply be divided into a response to primary and secondary bile acids, but rather reflects a complex and variable adaptation process enabling C. difficile to survive and to cause an infection in the intestinal tract."

They are widely used all over the world for ovarian stimulation in women, spermatogenesis stimulation in men, and ovulation induction and superovulation in animals. Despite the availability of many different preparations, all are made of the native hormones. Having different ligands with a wide activity range for a given receptor helps better understand its molecular and cellular signaling mechanisms as well as its physiological functions, and thus helps the development of more specific and adapted medicines. One way to control the gonadotropins' activity could be the use of modulating antibodies. Antibodies are powerful tools that were largely used to decipher gonadotropins' actions and they have shown their utility as therapeutics in several other indications such as cancer.

Methods: This study included 68 molecular-proven SCA3 patients. Extra-cerebellar signs were evaluated with the Inventory of Non-Ataxia Symptoms (INAS). The INAS count indicated the number of non-ataxia signs in each patient. The severity of ataxia, fatigue, EDS, sleep quality, anxiety, and depression were assessed using the Scale for the assessment and rating of ataxia (SARA), Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMA), and the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) (24 items), respectively. Results: Extra-cerebellar signs were detected in 91.2% of all SCA3 patients and the mean total INAS count was 2.72 ± 1.88. Rigidity was the most frequent extra-cerebellar sign (47.1%, N = 32). Sensory symptoms (2.9%, N = 2) and chorea (5.9%, N = 4) were rare, and myoclonus (0%) was not found in this cohort. High frequencies of sleep disturbances (64.7%), fatigue (52.9%), depression (48.5%), and anxiety (42.6%) were detected in SCA3 patients. The Spearman correlation indicated that the HAMD score was associated with the CAG repeat length and HAMA score, while the PSQI score was correlated with the SARA and FSS score. In addition, multivariate linear regression analysis showed that the CAG repeat length, age of onset, sleep disturbances and depression were significant predictors of fatigue in SCA3 patients. Conclusions: Our study indicates that the vast majority of SCA3 patients display extra-cerebellar signs. Except for EDS, anxiety, depression, fatigue and impaired sleep quality are present in SCA3 patients. The CAG repeat length, age of onset, sleep disturbances and depression are predictors of fatigue in SCA3 patients.","Detection of Children/Youth With Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder Through Eye Movement, Psychometric, and Neuroimaging Data.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833926,Frontiers in neurology,2019 03 07,"Background: Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) is one of the most common causes of developmental disabilities and neurobehavioral deficits. Despite the high-prevalence of FASD, the current diagnostic process is challenging and time- and money- consuming, with underreported profiles of the neurocognitive and neurobehavioral impairments because of limited clinical capacity. We assessed children/youth with FASD from a multimodal perspective and developed a high-performing, low-cost screening protocol using a machine learning framework. Methods and Findings: Participants with FASD and age-matched typically developing controls completed up to six assessments, including saccadic eye movement tasks (prosaccade, antisaccade, and memory-guided saccade), free viewing of videos, psychometric tests, and neuroimaging of the corpus callosum. We comparatively investigated new machine learning methods applied to these data, toward the acquisition of a quantitative signature of the neurodevelopmental deficits, and the development of an objective, high-throughput screening tool to identify children/youth with FASD. Our method provides a comprehensive profile of distinct measures in domains including sensorimotor and visuospatial control, visual perception, attention, inhibition, working memory, academic functions, and brain structure. We also showed that a combination of four to six assessments yields the best FASD vs. control classification accuracy; however, this protocol is expensive and time consuming. We conducted a cost/benefit analysis of the six assessments and developed a high-performing, low-cost screening protocol based on a subset of eye movement and psychometric tests that approached the best result under a range of constraints (time, cost, participant age, required administration, and access to neuroimaging facility). Using insights from the theory of value of information, we proposed an optimal annual screening procedure for children at risk of FASD. Conclusions: We developed a high-capacity, low-cost screening procedure under constrains, with high expected monetary benefit, substantial impact of the referral and diagnostic process, and expected maximized long-term benefits to the tested individuals and to society. This annual screening procedure for children/youth at risk of FASD can be easily and widely deployed for early identification, potentially leading to earlier intervention and treatment. This is crucial for neurodevelopmental disorders, to mitigate the severity of the disorder and/or frequency of secondary comorbidities.",Predicting Motor Outcomes in Stroke Patients Using Diffusion Spectrum MRI Microstructural Measures.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833925,Frontiers in neurology,2019 06 10,"Improved understanding of neuroimaging signal changes and their relation to patient outcomes after ischemic stroke is needed to improve ability to predict motor improvement and make therapy recommendations. The posterior limb of the internal capsule (PLIC) is a hub of afferent and efferent motor signaling and this work proposes new, image-based methods for prognosis based on interhemispheric differences in the PLIC. In this work, nine acute supratentorial ischemic stroke patients with motor impairment received a baseline, 203-direction diffusion brain MRI and a clinical assessment 3-12 days post-stroke and were compared to nine age-matched healthy controls. Asymmetries based on the mean and Kullback-Leibler divergence in the ipsilesional and contralesional PLIC were calculated for diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and diffusion spectrum imaging (DSI) measures from the baseline MRI. Predictions of upper extremity Fugl-Meyer (FM) scores at 5-weeks follow-up from baseline measures of PLIC asymmetry in diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and diffusion spectrum imaging (DSI) models were evaluated. For the stroke participants, the baseline asymmetry measures in the PLIC for the orientation dispersion index of the neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) model were highly correlated with upper extremity FM outcomes (r2 = 0.83). Use of DSI and the NODDI orientation dispersion index parameter shows promise of being more predictive of stroke recovery and to help better understand white matter changes in stroke, beyond DTI measures. The new finding that baseline interhemispheric differences in the PLIC calculated from the orientation dispersion index of the NODDI model are highly correlated with upper extremity functional outcomes may lead to improved image-based motor-outcome prediction after middle cerebral artery ischemic stroke.",Development of Quantitative and Temporal Scalar Implicatures in a Felicity Judgment Task.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833924,Frontiers in psychology,2019 03 07,"Experimental investigations into children's interpretation of scalar terms show that children have difficulties with scalar implicatures in tasks. In contrast with adults, they are for instance not able to derive the pragmatic interpretation that ""some"" means ""not all"" (Noveck, 2001; Papafragou and Musolino, 2003). However, there is also substantial experimental evidence that children are not incapable of drawing scalar inferences and that they are aware of the pragmatic potential of scalar expressions. In these kinds of studies, the prime interest is to discover what conditions facilitate implicature production for children. One of the factors that seem to be difficult for children is the generation of the scalar alternative. In a Felicity Judgment Task (FJT) the alternative is given. Participants are presented with a pair of utterances and asked to choose the most felicitous description. In such a task, even 5-year-old children are reported to show a very good performance. Our study wants to build on this tradition, by using a FJT where not only ""some-all"" choices are given, but also ""some-many"" and ""many-all."" In combination with a manipulation of the number of successes/failures in the stories, this enabled us to construct control, critical and ambiguous items. We compared the performance of 59 5-year-old children with that of 34 11-year-old children. The results indicated that performance of both age groups was clearly above chance, replicating previous findings. However, for the 5-year-old children, the critical and ambiguous items were more difficult than the control items and they also performed worse on these two types of items than the 11-year-old children. Interestingly with respect to the issue of scalar diversity, the 11-year-old children were also presented temporal items, which turned out to be more difficult than the quantitative ones.",Is Deep Acting Prevalent in Socially Responsible Companies? The Effects of CSR Perception on Emotional Labor Strategies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833923,Frontiers in psychology,2019 03 07,"This study examines the relationship between corporate social responsibility (CSR) perception and emotional labor strategies, and the effects of the interaction between CSR perception and moral identification on emotional labor strategies via affective organizational commitment. Our data from 352 frontline employees in the service industry show the main effect of CSR perception on emotional labor strategies. We find that CSR perception is positively (negatively) related to deep acting (surface acting). Affective organizational commitment mediates the relationship between CSR perception and surface acting but not between CSR perception and deep acting. Moral identification moderates the effects of CSR perception on surface acting through affective organizational commitment. This paper reveals that the employees' views on their organization's social responsiveness and morality affect their emotional labor strategies.",Riding the Adolescence: Personality Subtypes in Young Moped Riders and Their Association With Risky Driving Attitudes and Behaviors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833922,Frontiers in psychology,2019 03 07,"The aim of the present study was to identify sub-types of moped riders based on a cluster analysis of specific personality characteristics (i.e., driving anger, anxiety, angry hostility, excitement-seeking, altruism, normlessness, and driving locus of control) within a large sample of Italian adolescents. The study had also the aim to compare the emerged sub-types of moped riders on measures of attitudes toward safe driving, risky driving behaviors (e.g., rule's violations and speeding, not using helmet, drinking and driving, etc.), and self-reported tickets and accident involvement. One thousand two hundred seventy-three Italian high school students aged from 13 to 19 years (meanage = 15.43, SD = 0.98) with a valid driving license for moped participated to the study. Results revealed three sub-types of moped riders (namely risky, worried and careful moped riders), which differ significantly for risky driving behaviors, attitudes toward traffic safety, risk perception, and self-reported accident involvement. Importantly, the results of the present study showed that the personality and behavioral characteristics of the three sub-groups of moped riders substantially resembled those identified by previous studies with vehicle drivers of different ages; thus, empirically supporting the notion that certain combinations of personality characteristics are associated with risk driving tendencies and behaviors in both young moped riders and car drivers. Safe driving interventions can tackle risky driving beliefs and behavioral tendencies in young moped riders and car drivers by tailoring their messages according to the personality sub-types of the target groups.","The Combined Effect of Aging and Performance Level on Pacing in Duathlon - the ""ITU Powerman Long Distance Duathlon World Championships"".",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833921,Frontiers in psychology,2019 03 07,"The role of age and performance level has been investigated in runners such as marathoners, but not in multi-sports athletes such as duathletes (running, cycling, and running). Thus, the aim of the present study was to examine the combined effects of aging and performance level on pacing of duathletes competing in two different race distances. Pacing (defined as the relative contribution of cycling time, %, to the overall race time) was analyzed for 6,671 duathletes competing from 2003 to 2017 in the short distance race (10 km first run, 50 km cycling and 5 km second run) or long distance race (10 km first run, 150 km cycling and 30 km second run) of ""Powerman Zofingen,"" the ""ITU Powerman Long Distance Duathlon World Championships."" Men were faster, older, and spent less time (%) in cycling than women in both distances races (p < 0.001). Younger age groups spent more time (%) in cycling than their older counterparts in women (both short and long distance, p = 0.036, ηp2 = 0.031, p = 0.025, ηp2 = 0.044, respectively) and men (long distance race, p < 0.001, ηp2 = 0.016). Fast performance groups spent more time (%) in cycling than their slower counterparts in short (women, p < 0.001, ηp2 = 0.057; men, p < 0.001, ηp2 = 0.035) and long distance (women, p < 0.001, ηp2 = 0.070; men, p < 0.001, ηp2 = 0.052). A small age group × performance group interaction on cycling time (%) was observed in the men's short distance (p = 0.001, ηp2 = 0.020) - but not in the long distance or in women - with smaller differences between performance groups in the older than in the younger age groups. Women, young and fast duathletes were relatively slower in cycling than men, old and slow duathletes; that was, old duathletes were relatively faster in cycling than in running. Moreover, there was indication that the difference in pacing among performance groups might be attenuated with aging. Since fast duathletes were relatively faster in running than in cycling, slow duathletes should be encouraged to cycle slower and run faster.",The Effectiveness of Psychoeducational Support Groups for Women With Breast Cancer and Their Caregivers: A Mixed Methods Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833920,Frontiers in psychology,2019 03 07,"Background: Previous studies on the effectiveness of psychological interventions in oncology mainly used quantitative measures and no study was conducted with regard to both caregivers and patients. Aim: This study evaluates the effectiveness of psychoeducational support groups, both for women with breast cancer, and for their informal caregivers through the use of quantitative and qualitative measures. Methods: A longitudinal design was used comparing two psychoeducational support groups with other two groups in a standard care control condition. Participants were 28 women with a diagnosis of breast cancer in the care of a hospital in Northern Italy, and 21 family caregivers. The quantitative data were collected by Cognitive Behavioral Assessment for Outcome Evaluation (CBA-OE) and the qualitative data through the use of semi-structured interviews. Results: The statistical analysis showed a significant change attributable to the psychological intervention that proves the effectiveness of such an intervention in the patients' and caregivers' group. The qualitative analysis allowed us to interpret the behavioral and psychological profile emerging from CBA-OE, by considering the subjective experience of the treatment groups. The group experience offered affective, relational and informative support, and allowed participants to create a network and to feel understood and reassured. Conclusion: The results suggest the usefulness of psychoeducational support groups for women with breast cancer and for their caregivers. The value of this kind of intervention is not only at an individual level but also at a systems level, and family involvement ensures the best positive outcomes.",Job Insecurity and Mental Health: The Moderating Role of Coping Strategies From a Gender Perspective.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833919,Frontiers in psychology,2019 03 07,"Job insecurity is a growing phenomenon, typical of an employment context characterised by high rates of temporary work and unemployment. Previous research has shown a direct relationship between job insecurity and mental health impairment. The present analysis goes into this relationship in depth, studying the moderating role of coping strategies and predicting that men and women implement different types of strategies. A sample of 1.008 workers is analysed, 588 women and 420 men. The Tobin CSI scale was used to analyse the coping strategies, in addition to JIS-8 to assess job insecurity, the MOS Perceived Social Support Survey and the GHQ-28 test to evaluate mental health. Then, a hierarchical linear regression was designed to study the moderating role of 8 coping strategies of job insecurity and 4 mental health subscales in men and women, separately. Results illustrate that coping strategies play a moderating role in the relationship between job insecurity and mental health. However, the aggravating role of disengagement coping strategies is more relevant than the buffering role of engagement strategies. On the other hand, women implement a greater number of coping strategies, with more positive results for mental health. Also, in the relationship between job insecurity and mental health the most important strategies are the ones related to social interaction inside and outside an organisation, and these are the main ones used by women. It therefore follows that strengthening rich social relationships inside and outside the working environment is a guarantee of well-being."

This raises particular concerns for athletes who will likely to be exposed to extreme heat during the competitions. Therefore, in mass-participation event during warm season, it is vital for the hosting organization to build preparedness and resilience against heat, including appropriate treatment, and management strategies for exertional heat stroke (EHS). However, despite the existing literature regarding the evidence-based management of EHS, rectal thermometry and whole-body cold-water immersion are not readily accepted by medical professionals outside of the sports, and military medicine professionals. Current Japanese medical standard is no exception in falling behind on evidence-based management of EHS. Therefore, the first aim of this paper is to elucidate the inconsistency between the standard of care provided in Japan for EHS and what has been accepted as the gold standard by the scientific literature. The second aim of this paper is to provide optimal EHS management strategies that should be implemented at the Tokyo 2020 Summer Olympics from organizational level to maximize the safety of athletes and to improve organizational resilience to heat. The risk of extreme heat is often neglected until a catastrophic incidence occurs. It is vital for the Japanese medical leadership and athletic communities to re-examine the current EHS management strategies and implement evidence-based countermeasure for EHS to expand the application of scientific knowledge.",Glutamatergic Receptors Modulate Normoxic but Not Hypoxic Ventilation and Metabolism in Naked Mole Rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833905,Frontiers in physiology,2019 03 07,"Naked mole rats (Heterocephalus glaber) are among the most hypoxia-tolerant mammals, but their physiological responses to acute and chronic sustained hypoxia (CSH), and the molecular underpinnings of these responses, are poorly understood. In the present study we evaluated the acute hypoxic ventilatory response and the occurrence of ventilatory acclimatization to hypoxia following CSH exposure (8-10 days in 8% O2) of naked mole rats. We also investigated the role of excitatory glutamatergic signaling in the control of ventilation and metabolism in these conditions. Animals acclimated to normoxia (control) or CSH and then exposed to acute hypoxia (7% O2 for 1 h) exhibited elevated tidal volume (VT), but decreased breathing frequency (fR). As a result, total ventilation (

E) remained unchanged. Conversely, VT was lower in CSH animals relative to controls, suggesting that there is ventilatory plasticity following acclimatization to chronic hypoxia. Both control and CSH-acclimated naked mole rats exhibited similar 60-65% decreases in O2 consumption rate during acute hypoxia, and as a result their air convection requirement (ACR) increased ∼2.4 to 3-fold. Glutamatergic receptor inhibition decreased fR,

E, and the rate of O2 consumption in normoxia but did not alter these ventilatory or metabolic responses to acute hypoxia in either the control or CSH groups. Taken together, these findings indicate that ventilatory acclimatization to hypoxia is atypical in naked mole rats, and glutamatergic signaling is not involved in their hypoxic ventilatory or metabolic responses to acute or chronic hypoxia.",Peritoneal Protein Clearance Is a Function of Local Inflammation and Membrane Area Whereas Systemic Inflammation and Comorbidity Predict Survival of Incident Peritoneal Dialysis Patients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833904,Frontiers in physiology,2019 03 07,"It is not clear whether the association of increased peritoneal protein clearance (PPCl) with worse survival on peritoneal dialysis (PD) is a consequence of either local or systemic inflammation or indicative of generalized endothelial dysfunction associated with comorbidity. To investigate this we determined the relationship of PPCl to comorbidity, membrane area (equivalent to low molecular weight peritoneal solute transport rate), local and systemic inflammation and hypoalbuminaemia, and for each of these with patient survival. 257 incident patients from three GLOBAL Fluid Study centers were included in this analysis. Clinical profiles were collected at baseline along with a peritoneal equilibration test, 24-h dialysate protein and paired plasma and dialysate cytokine measurements. Although peritoneal protein clearance was associated with increased age and severe comorbidity on univariate analysis, only dialysate IL-6, peritoneal solute transport rate, plasma albumin and cardiac comorbidities (ischaemic heart disease and left ventricular dysfunction) were independent explanatory variables on multivariate analysis. While peritoneal protein clearance and daily peritoneal protein loss were associated with survival in univariate analysis, on multivariate analysis only plasma IL-6, age, residual kidney function, comorbidity, and plasma albumin were independent predictors. Peritoneal protein clearance is primarily a function of peritoneal membrane area and local membrane inflammation. The association with comorbidity and survival is predominantly explained by its inverse relationship to hypoalbuminaemia, especially in diabetics.",hCLE/RTRAF-HSPC117-DDX1-FAM98B: A New Cap-Binding Complex That Activates mRNA Translation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833903,Frontiers in physiology,2019 03 07,"hCLE/C14orf166/RTRAF, DDX1, and HSPC117 are components of cytoplasmic mRNA-transporting granules kinesin-associated in dendrites. They have also been found in cytoplasmic ribosome-containing RNA granules that transport specific mRNAs halted for translation until specific neuronal signals renders them accessible to the translation machinery. hCLE associates to DDX1, HSPC117, and FAM98B in HEK293T cells and all four proteins bind to cap analog-containing resins. Competition and elution experiments indicate that binding of hCLE complex to cap resins is independent of eIF4E; the cap-binding factor needed for translation. Purified hCLE free of its associated proteins binds cap with low affinity suggesting that its interacting proteins modulate its cap association. hCLE silencing reduces hCLE accumulation and that of its interacting proteins and decreases mRNA translation. hCLE-associated RNAs have been isolated and sequenced; RNAs involved in mRNA translation are specifically associated. The data suggest that RNA granules may co-transport RNAs encoding proteins involved in specific functions together with RNAs that encode proteins needed for the translation of these specific RNAs and indicate an important role for hCLE modulating mRNA translation.",Measurement of Neurovascular Coupling in Neonates.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833901,Frontiers in physiology,2019 03 07,"Neurovascular coupling refers to the mechanism that links the transient neural activity to the subsequent change in cerebral blood flow, which is regulated by both chemical signals and mechanical effects. Recent studies suggest that neurovascular coupling in neonates and preterm born infants is different compared to adults. The hemodynamic response after a stimulus is later and less pronounced and the stimulus might even result in a negative (hypoxic) signal. In addition, studies both in animals and neonates confirm the presence of a short hypoxic period after a stimulus in preterm infants. In clinical practice, different methodologies exist to study neurovascular coupling. The combination of functional magnetic resonance imaging or functional near-infrared spectroscopy (brain hemodynamics) with EEG (brain function) is most commonly used in neonates. Especially near-infrared spectroscopy is of interest, since it is a non-invasive method that can be integrated easily in clinical care and is able to provide results concerning longer periods of time. Therefore, near-infrared spectroscopy can be used to develop a continuous non-invasive measurement system, that could be used to study neonates in different clinical settings, or neonates with different pathologies. The main challenge for the development of a continuous marker for neurovascular coupling is how the coupling between the signals can be described. In practice, a wide range of signal interaction measures exist. Moreover, biomedical signals often operate on different time scales. In a more general setting, other variables also have to be taken into account, such as oxygen saturation, carbon dioxide and blood pressure in order to describe neurovascular coupling in a concise manner. Recently, new mathematical techniques were developed to give an answer to these questions. This review discusses these recent developments.",The Skeletal Muscle as an Active Player Against Cancer Cachexia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833900,Frontiers in physiology,2019 03 07,"The management of cancer patients is frequently complicated by the occurrence of cachexia. This is a complex syndrome that markedly impacts on quality of life as well as on tolerance and response to anticancer treatments. Loss of body weight, wasting of both adipose tissue and skeletal muscle and reduced survival rates are among the main features of cachexia. Skeletal muscle wasting has been shown to depend, mainly at least, on the induction of protein degradation rates above physiological levels. Such hypercatabolic pattern is driven by overactivation of different intracellular proteolytic systems, among which those dependent on ubiquitin-proteasome and autophagy. Selective rather than bulk degradation of altered proteins and organelles was also proposed to occur. Within the picture described above, the muscle is frequently considered a sort of by-stander tissue where external stimuli, directly or indirectly, can poise protein metabolism toward a catabolic setting. By contrast, several observations suggest that the muscle reacts to the wasting drive imposed by cancer growth by activating different compensatory strategies that include anabolic capacity, the activation of autophagy and myogenesis. Even if muscle response is eventually ill-fated, its occurrence supports the idea that in the presence of appropriate treatments the development of cancer-induced wasting might not be an ineluctable event in tumor hosts.",Pan-Canadian Pharmaceutical Alliance (pCPA): Timelines Analysis and Policy Implications.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833899,Frontiers in pharmacology,2019 03 07,"This analysis follows our recent study showing that Canadian public reimbursement delays have lengthened from regulatory approval to listing decisions by public drug plans and delayed public access to innovative medicines, mainly due to processes following the Common Drug Review (CDR) and the pan-Canadian Oncology Drug Review (pCODR). Public drug plans participate in a pan-Canadian Pharmaceutical Alliance (pCPA) joint negotiation process before making decisions about whether or not to reimburse a product reviewed through CDR and pCODR. This research aims to report the findings from a comprehensive analysis of pCPA process times, times to reimbursement by public payers in Canada, and to explore the opportunities to reduce total delays in public reimbursement with a specific focus on the pCPA process. An analysis was conducted of pCPA timelines with respect to making decisions about products and indications reviewed through CDR/pCODR, and focusses on three separate time components: time to begin negotiating, time spent negotiating, and time to implement the negotiation (i.e., time to list) in each of nine jurisdictions (i.e., 10 provinces of Canada, excluding Quebec). This study demonstrates the role of post-CDR/pCODR processes in large and lengthening delays to listing new medicines. Notably, oncology products have experienced the longest increases in time to begin negotiating and to complete negotiations. Trends in listing times post-pCPA across provinces are less clear, however, it appears that consistency in terms of timelines across provinces is not happening quite so smoothly for oncology products compared to non-oncology products. Listing rates also appear to be declining for non-oncology products, although this trend is less conclusive for oncology products. Challenges need to be addressed to improve efficiency, transparency, and ultimately reduce pCPA timelines and total timelines to public reimbursement. Suggested ways to improve and streamline the listing process are: (1) transparent target timelines and associated performance incentives for the pCPA and public plan decisions, (2) parallel HTA-pCPA processes to enable pCPA negotiations to start part-way through the HTA review and allow pCPA negotiation information to be fed back into the HTA review, and (3) innovative agreements that consider patient input and earlier coverage with real-world evidence development.",An in vitro ADME and in vivo Pharmacokinetic Study of Novel TB-Active Decoquinate Derivatives.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833898,Frontiers in pharmacology,2019 03 07,"Tuberculosis (TB) is currently the leading cause of mortality due to an infectious disease, despite the existence of multiple effective first-line and second-line drugs. The current anti-TB regimen requires a prolonged treatment period of around 6 months and is only efficacious against drug-sensitive strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). With a rise in cases of multi-drug resistant and extensively drug resistant strains of Mtb, newer treatments comprising compounds with novel mechanisms of action are required. Although decoquinate (DQ) is inactive against Mtb, its derivatives are of interest to anti-TB drug discovery because of their potential to permeate the mycobacterial cell wall, Mtb-infected macrophages, and granulomatous lesions by passive diffusion. The compounds also display mechanisms of action which are unlike those of currently used quinolones, potentially displaying activity against new targets. Three such derivatives bearing an alkyl group at N-1 and an amide group at C-3 (RMB 041, -043, and -073) displayed potent in vitro activities against Mtb H37Rv (90% minimum inhibitory concentrations, MIC90 = 1.61, 4.18, and 1.88 μM, respectively) and high selectivity indices (10-25). In this study, we evaluated the drug-like properties (in vitro microsomal stability, microsomal/plasma protein binding, kinetic solubility, lipophilicity, and passive permeability) and pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of these compounds after intravenous and oral administration to male C57BL/6 mice. The compounds showed markedly improved kinetic solubilities compared to that of the parental DQ and were metabolically stable in vitro. The maximum concentrations reached after oral administration were 5.4 ± 0.40, 5.6 ± 1.40, and 2.0 ± 0.03 μM; elimination half-lives were 23.4 ± 2.50, 6.2 ± 0.80, and 11.6 ± 1.30 h; and bioavailabilities were 21.4 ± 1.0, 22.1 ± 2.2, and 5.9 ± 1.3 for RMB041, -043, and -073, respectively. These compounds therefore display promising drug-like properties, and their PK/toxicity profiles (including long half-lives both in vitro and in vivo) support their potential as candidates for further investigation in animal models of Mtb infection.",Glabridin Prevents Doxorubicin-Induced Cardiotoxicity Through Gut Microbiota Modulation and Colonic Macrophage Polarization in Mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833897,Frontiers in pharmacology,2019 03 07,"The chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin (DOX) provokes a dose-related cardiotoxicity. Thus, there is an urgent need to identify the underlying mechanisms and develop strategies to overcome them. Here we demonstrated that glabridin (GLA), an isoflavone from licorice root, prevents DOX-induced cardiotoxicity through gut microbiota modulation and colonic macrophage polarization in mice. GLA reduced DOX-induced leakage of myocardial enzymes including aminotransferase, creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, and creatine kinase-MB. GLA downregulated pro-apoptotic proteins (Bax, cleaved-caspase 9 and cleaved-caspase 3) and upregulated anti-apoptotic proteins (HAX-1 and Bcl-2) in the cardiac tissues. In addition, GLA modulated DOX-induced dysbiosis of gut microbiota and thereby decreased the ratio of M1/M2 colonic macrophage, accompanied by the downregulated lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and upregulated butyrate in the feces and peripheral blood. The leakage of myocardial enzymes induced by the DOX was decreased by antibiotics treatment, but not altered by co-treatment with the GLA and antibiotics. The ratio of M1/M2 colonic macrophage and leakage of myocardial enzymes reduced by the GLA were greatly increased by the Desulfovibrio vulgaris or LPS but decreased by the butyrate. Depletion of the macrophage attenuated DOX-induced cardiotoxicity but failed to further affect the effects of GLA. Importantly, GLA decreased production of M1 cytokines (IL-1β and TNF-α) but increased production of M2 cytokines (IL-10 and TGF-β) in the colonic macrophage with the downregulation of NF-κB and the upregulation of STAT6. In summary, GLA prevents DOX-induced cardiotoxicity through gut microbiota modulation and colonic macrophage polarization, and may serve as a potential therapeutic strategy for the DOX-induced cardiotoxicity.","Retooling Computational Techniques for EEG-Based Neurocognitive Modeling of Children's Data, Validity and Prospects for Learning and Education.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833896,Frontiers in computational neuroscience,2019 03 07,"This paper describes continuing research on the building of neurocognitive models of the internal mental and brain processes of children using a novel adapted combination of existing computational approaches and tools, and using electro-encephalographic (EEG) data to validate the models. The guiding working model which was pragmatically selected for investigation was the established and widely used Adaptive Control of Thought-Rational (ACT-R) modeling architecture from cognitive science. The anatomo-functional circuitry covered by ACT-R is validated by MRI-based neuroscience research. The present experimental data was obtained from a cognitive neuropsychology study involving preschool children (aged 4-6), which measured their visual selective attention and word comprehension behaviors. The collection and analysis of Event-Related Potentials (ERPs) from the EEG data allowed for the identification of sources of electrical activity known as dipoles within the cortex, using a combination of computational tools (Independent Component Analysis, FASTICA; EEG-Lab DIPFIT). The results were then used to build neurocognitive models based on Python ACT-R such that the patterns and the timings of the measured EEG could be reproduced as simplified symbolic representations of spikes, built through simplified electric-field simulations. The models simulated ultimately accounted for more than three-quarters of variations spatially and temporally in all electrical potential measurements (fit of model to dipole data expressed as R2 ranged between 0.75 and 0.98; P < 0.0001). Implications for practical uses of the present work are discussed for learning and educational applications in non-clinical and special needs children's populations, and for the possible use of non-experts (teachers and parents)."

Bystander effects, another type of biological effect induced by LDR, have been shown to widely occur in many cell types. Furthermore, the influence of LDR-induced biological effects on certain diseases, such as cancer and diabetes, has also attracted the interest of researchers. Many studies have suggested that LDR has the potential antitumor and antidiabetic complications effects. In addition, the researches on whether LDR could induce stochastic effects were also debated. Studies on the biological effects of LDR in China started in 1970s and considerable progress has been made since. In the present article, we provide an overview of the research progress on the biological effects of LDR in China.",Analysis of mRNA Expression Patterns in Peripheral Blood Cells of 3 Patients With Cancer After the First Fraction of 2 Gy Irradiation: An Integrated Case Report and Systematic Review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833875,Dose-response : a publication of International Hormesis Society,2019 03 07,"Radiation therapy induces acute and chronic radiological toxicity, in particular hematological toxicity (HT).

Preoperatively, patients should be encouraged to hydrate until 2 hours prior to the induction of anesthesia with a carbohydrate-containing clear liquid. When mechanical bowel preparation is necessary, with modern isoosmotic solutions, fluid repletion is not necessary. Intraoperatively, fluid therapy should aim to maintain euvolemia with an individualized approach. While some patients may benefit from goal-directed fluid therapy, a restrictive, zero-balance approach to intraoperative fluid management may be reasonable.

Carcinoid heart disease has a multifactorial pathophysiology, and the right side of the heart is usually involved. Symptoms and signs vary depending upon the affected cardiac components; most typical is right-sided heart failure secondary to diseased tricuspid and pulmonary valves. Despite no single ideal diagnostic test, strong suspicion, coupled with serologic and imaging results, usually enables diagnosis. Advances in imaging, such as speckle-tracking echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance, have improved the diagnostic yield. Treatment is challenging, warrants a multidisciplinary approach, and can be medical or surgical depending on the cardiac manifestations.

The aim of this study was to evaluate how the systemic right ventricle adapts to increased workload and oxygen demand during exercise. From November 2005 through December 2015, 3,358 adult patients with congenital heart disease were treated at our institution; we identified 48 (26 females, 22 males; median age, 25.4 ± 8.1 yr) who met the study criteria; 37 had DTGA and atrial switch repair, and 11 had CCTGA. We studied their echocardiographic and cardiopulmonary exercise test results. A control group consisted of 29 healthy sex- and age-matched volunteers. On exercise testing, oxygen uptake at anaerobic threshold, peak oxygen uptake, peak heart rate, and percentage of maximal heart rate were significantly lower in the group with systemic right ventricle than in the control group (all P <0.001); in contrast, the peak ventilatory equivalent for carbon dioxide was higher in the study group (P=0.013). Impaired systemic right ventricular function reduced peak oxygen uptake. The peak heart rate was lower in the CCTGA group than in the DTGA group. Our results indicate that reduced exercise capacity is related to impaired systemic right ventricular function, severe tricuspid valve regurgitation, and chronotropic incompetence. There was no correlation between cardiopulmonary exercise test results and time after surgery.

Frequent fires are a natural feature in this biome and have influences on vegetation structure and composition. However, continuous anthropogenic actions are promoting changes in fire frequency and seasonality. Despite the high biodiversity of the Cerrado, little is known about its microbiome, with few publications describing some aspects of the bacterial and fungal communities found on this biome and almost no references about archaea. In this study, we describe the archaeal diversity in Cerrado sensu stricto soils, comparing the archaeal communities from soils of an area long protected from fires to one exposed to biennial fires, using both 16S rRNA and amoA genes as molecular markers. Almost all 16S rRNA sequences from both studied areas were affiliated with I.1b and 1.1c Thaumarchaeota, groups commonly detected in terrestrial environments. A higher relative abundance of I.1b thaumarchaeal subgroup was detected in the frequently burned area even though no statistically significant differences were observed in archaeal 16S rRNA richness and diversity between the investigated areas. Many ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) are affiliated with this group, which is consistent with the higher amoA diversity and OTU numbers detected in the area periodically burned. Taken together, our results suggest that, although total archaeal community richness and diversity do not seem to greatly differ between the investigated conditions, alterations in wood cover and vegetation structure caused by frequent fires likely cause long-term effects in AOA diversity in Cerrado soils."

The TrpAgNPs were synthesized by photoreduction method, and the influence of irradiation time and concentration of reagents were analyzed. The nanoparticles were characterized by transmission electron microscopy, Zeta Potential and (UV)-absorption spectra. The antibacterial activity of TrpAgNPs was tested for antibiotic-resistant and susceptible pathogens, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella typhimurium, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, evaluating the influence of photoreduction parameters in bactericidal effect. The results have shown that TrpAgNPs solutions with lower tryptophan/silver nitrate (AgNO3) ratio and higher AgNO3 concentration have higher bactericidal action against bacteria with inhibition of ~100% in almost all studied bacterial strains. The antimicrobial activity of TrpAgNPs within biofilms generated under static conditions of antibiotic-resistant and susceptible strains of S. aureus, S. epidermidis, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, C. freundii, and P. aeruginosa was also investigated.

Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging are the gold standards to quantify VAT. However, the high cost, limited accessibility, and potential exposure to radiation limit the use of these imaging modalities. In this commentary, we review the application of a previously validated regression equation that estimates anthropometrically predicted VAT (apVAT) to explain variance in blood-based biomarkers and predict mortality in a large sample of adults. In our first study (Brown et al. 2018 Eur J Nutr; doi:10.1007/s00394-016-1308-8), apVAT accounted for more variance in biomarkers of glucose homeostasis, inflammation, and lipid metabolism, than body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), or the combination of BMI + WC. In our second study (Brown et al. 2017 Am J Hum Biol; doi:10.1002/ajhb.22898), compared with BMI, WC, and BMI + WC, apVAT more accurately predicted mortality from all causes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer.

In addition to four core subunits, PRC2 comprises multiple accessory subunits that vary in their composition during cellular differentiation and define two major holo-PRC2 complexes: PRC2.1 and PRC2.2. PRC2 binds to RNA, which inhibits its enzymatic activity, but the mechanism of RNA-mediated inhibition of holo-PRC2 is poorly understood. Here we present in vivo and in vitro protein-RNA interaction maps and identify an RNA-binding patch within the allosteric regulatory site of human and mouse PRC2, adjacent to the methyltransferase center.

Using structural biology, mass spectrometry and cross-linking, we investigated the architecture of two evolutionarily distant SMC-kleisin complexes: MukBEF from Escherichia coli, and cohesin from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We show that both contain a dynamic coiled-coil discontinuity, the elbow, near the middle of their arms that permits a folded conformation. Bending at the elbow brings into proximity the hinge dimerization domain and the head-kleisin module, situated at opposite ends of the arms.

The mechanisms that localize liquid phases in cells, however, are not fully understood. P granules are RNA granules that form in the posterior of Caenorhabditis elegans embryos. Theoretical studies have suggested that spontaneous LLPS of the RNA-binding protein PGL-3 with RNA drives the assembly of P granules. We find that the PGL-3 phase is intrinsically labile and requires a second phase for stabilization in embryos. The second phase is formed by gel-like assemblies of the disordered protein MEG-3 that associate with liquid PGL-3 droplets in the embryo posterior. Co-assembly of gel phases and liquid phases confers local stability and long-range dynamics, both of which contribute to localized assembly of P granules. Our findings suggest that condensation of RNA granules can be regulated spatially by gel-like polymers that stimulate LLPS locally in the cytoplasm.",The macroH2A1.2 histone variant links ATRX loss to alternative telomere lengthening.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833786,Nature structural & molecular biology,2019 06 10,"The growth of telomerase-deficient cancers depends on the alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT), a homology-directed telomere-maintenance pathway. ALT telomeres exhibit a unique chromatin environment and generally lack the nucleosome remodeler ATRX, pointing to an epigenetic basis for ALT. Recently, we identified a protective role for the ATRX-interacting macroH2A1.2 histone variant during homologous recombination and replication stress (RS). Consistent with an inherent susceptibility to RS, we show that human ALT telomeres are highly enriched for macroH2A1.2. However, in contrast to ATRX-proficient cells, ALT telomeres transiently lose macroH2A1.2 during acute RS to facilitate DNA double-strand break (DSB) formation, a process that is almost completely prevented by ectopic ATRX expression. Telomeric macroH2A1.2 is re-deposited in a DNA damage response (DDR)-dependent manner to promote homologous recombination-associated ALT pathways. Our findings thus identify the dynamic exchange of macroH2A1.2 on chromatin as an epigenetic link among ATRX loss, RS-induced DDR initiation and telomere maintenance via homologous recombination.",Structural basis of broad ebolavirus neutralization by a human survivor antibody.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833785,Nature structural & molecular biology,2019 03 08,"The structural features that govern broad-spectrum activity of broadly neutralizing anti-ebolavirus antibodies (Abs) outside of the internal fusion loop epitope are currently unknown.

The crystal structure of ADI-15946 in complex with cleaved Ebola virus glycoprotein (EBOV GPCL) reveals that binding of the mAb structurally mimics the conserved interaction between the EBOV GP core and its glycan cap β17-β18 loop to inhibit infection. Both endosomal proteolysis of EBOV GP and binding of mAb FVM09 displace this loop, thereby increasing exposure of ADI-15946's conserved epitope and enhancing neutralization.

The potential contributions of physicochemical properties of enhancer assembly in signaling events remain poorly understood. Here we report that in human breast cancer cells, the acute 17β-estradiol-dependent activation of functional enhancers requires assembly of an enhancer RNA-dependent ribonucleoprotein (eRNP) complex exhibiting properties of phase-separated condensates. Unexpectedly, while acute ligand-dependent assembly of eRNPs resulted in enhancer activation sensitive to chemical disruption of phase separation, chronically activated enhancers proved resistant to such disruption, with progressive maturation of eRNPs to a more gel-like state. Acute, but not chronic, stimulation resulted in ligand-induced, condensin-dependent changes in spatial chromatin conformation based on homotypic enhancer association, resulting in cooperative enhancer-activation events. Thus, distinct physicochemical properties of eRNP condensates on enhancers serve as determinants of rapid ligand-dependent alterations in chromosomal architecture and cooperative enhancer activation.",A gap-protected zero-Hall effect state in the quantum limit of the non-symmorphic metal KHgSb.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833782,Nature materials,2019 05 07,"A recurring theme in topological matter is the protection of unusual electronic states by symmetry, for example, protection of the surface states in Z2 topological insulators by time-reversal symmetry1-3.

Here we report measurements of the Hall conductivity in KHgSb in a strong magnetic field B. In the quantum limit, the Hall conductivity is observed to fall exponentially to zero, but the diagonal conductivity is finite. A large gap protects this unusual zero-Hall state. We theoretically propose that, in this quantum limit, the chemical potential drops into the bulk gap, intersecting equal numbers of right- and left-moving quantum spin Hall surface modes to produce the zero-Hall state.

The bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE) is a second-order nonlinear optical effect that intrinsically converts light into electrical current. Here, we demonstrate a large mid-infrared BPVE in microscopic devices of the Weyl semimetal TaAs. This discovery results from combining recent developments in Weyl semimetals, focused-ion beam fabrication and theoretical works suggesting a connection between BPVE and topology. We also present a detailed symmetry analysis that allows us to separate the shift current response from photothermal effects. The magnitude and wavelength range of the assigned shift current may impact optical detectors, clean energy and topology, and demonstrate the utility of Weyl semimetals for practical applications.",Nonlinear photoresponse of type-II Weyl semimetals.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833780,Nature materials,2019 05 07,"The experimental manifestation of topological effects in bulk materials is attracting enormous research interest. However, direct experimental evidence of the effective k-space monopole of the Weyl nodes has so far been lacking. Here, signatures of the singular topology of the type-II Weyl semimetal TaIrTe4 are revealed in the photoresponses, which are related to divergence of the Berry curvature. TaIrTe4 exhibits a large photoresponsivity of 130.2 mA W-1-with 4 μm excitation in an unbiased field-effect transistor at room temperature-arising from the third-order nonlinear optical response, approaching the performance of commercial low-temperature detectors. In addition, the circularly polarized galvanic response is enhanced at 4 μm, possibly due to the same Berry curvature singularity enhancement. Considering the optical selection rule of chiral Weyl cones, this may open the door for studying and controlling the chiral polarization of Weyl fermions with an electric field in addition to the optical helicities.",Potassium channel selectivity filter dynamics revealed by single-molecule FRET.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833778,Nature chemical biology,2019 05 15,"Potassium (K) channels exhibit exquisite selectivity for conduction of K+ ions over other cations, particularly Na+. High-resolution structures reveal an archetypal selectivity filter (SF) conformation in which dehydrated K+ ions, but not Na+ ions, are perfectly coordinated. Using single-molecule FRET (smFRET), we show that the SF-forming loop (SF-loop) in KirBac1.1 transitions between constrained and dilated conformations as a function of ion concentration. The constrained conformation, essential for selective K+ permeability, is stabilized by K+ but not Na+ ions. Mutations that render channels nonselective result in dilated and dynamically unstable conformations, independent of the permeant ion. Further, while wild-type KirBac1.1 channels are K+ selective in physiological conditions, Na+ permeates in the absence of K+. Moreover, whereas K+ gradients preferentially support 86Rb+ fluxes, Na+ gradients preferentially support 22Na+ fluxes. This suggests differential ion selectivity in constrained versus dilated states, potentially providing a structural basis for this anomalous mole fraction effect."

Downstream of KRAS, the RAF→MEK→ERK signaling pathway plays a central role in pancreatic carcinogenesis5. However, paradoxically, inhibition of this pathway has provided no clinical benefit to patients with PDA6. Here we show that inhibition of KRAS→RAF→MEK→ERK signaling elicits autophagy, a process of cellular recycling that protects PDA cells from the cytotoxic effects of KRAS pathway inhibition. Mechanistically, inhibition of MEK1/2 leads to activation of the LKB1→AMPK→ULK1 signaling axis, a key regulator of autophagy. Furthermore, combined inhibition of MEK1/2 plus autophagy displays synergistic anti-proliferative effects against PDA cell lines in vitro and promotes regression of xenografted patient-derived PDA tumors in mice. The observed effect of combination trametinib plus chloroquine was not restricted to PDA as other tumors, including patient-derived xenografts (PDX) of NRAS-mutated melanoma and BRAF-mutated colorectal cancer displayed similar responses. Finally, treatment of a patient with PDA with the combination of trametinib plus hydroxychloroquine resulted in a partial, but nonetheless striking disease response. These data suggest that this combination therapy may represent a novel strategy to target RAS-driven cancers.",Clinical genome sequencing uncovers potentially targetable truncations and fusions of MAP3K8 in spitzoid and other melanomas.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833747,Nature medicine,2019 05 10,"Spitzoid melanoma is a specific morphologic variant of melanoma that most commonly affects children and adolescents, and ranges on the spectrum of malignancy from low grade to overtly malignant. These tumors are generally driven by fusions of ALK, RET, NTRK1/3, MET, ROS1 and BRAF1,2. However, in approximately 50% of cases no genetic driver has been established2. Clinical whole-genome and transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) of a spitzoid tumor from an adolescent revealed a novel gene fusion of MAP3K8, encoding a serine-threonine kinase that activates MEK3,4. The patient, who had exhausted all other therapeutic options, was treated with a MEK inhibitor and underwent a transient clinical response. We subsequently analyzed spitzoid tumors from 49 patients by RNA-Seq and found in-frame fusions or C-terminal truncations of MAP3K8 in 33% of cases. The fusion transcripts and truncated genes all contained MAP3K8 exons 1-8 but lacked the autoinhibitory final exon. Data mining of RNA-Seq from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) uncovered analogous MAP3K8 rearrangements in 1.5% of adult melanomas. Thus, MAP3K8 rearrangements-uncovered by comprehensive clinical sequencing of a single case-are the most common genetic event in spitzoid melanoma, are present in adult melanomas and could be amenable to MEK inhibition.","Extreme mito-nuclear discordance in a peninsular lizard: the role of drift, selection, and climate.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833746,Heredity,2019 03 05,"Nuclear and mitochondrial genomes coexist within cells but are subject to different tempos and modes of evolution. Evolutionary forces such as drift, mutation, selection, and migration are expected to play fundamental roles in the origin and maintenance of diverged populations; however, divergence may lag between genomes subject to different modes of inheritance and functional specialization. Herein, we explore whole mitochondrial genome data and thousands of nuclear single nucleotide polymorphisms to evidence extreme mito-nuclear discordance in the small black-tailed brush lizard, Urosaurus nigricaudus, of the Peninsula of Baja California, Mexico and southern California, USA, and discuss potential drivers. Results show three deeply divergent mitochondrial lineages dating back to the later Miocene (ca. 5.5 Ma) and Pliocene (ca. 2.8 Ma) that likely followed geographic isolation due to trans-peninsular seaways. This contrasts with very low levels of genetic differentiation in nuclear loci (FST < 0.028) between mtDNA lineages. Analyses of protein-coding genes reveal substantial fixed variation between mitochondrial lineages, of which a significant portion comes from non-synonymous mutations. A mixture of drift and selection is likely responsible for the rise of these mtDNA groups, albeit with little evidence of marked differences in climatic niche space between them. Finally, future investigations can look further into the role that mito-nuclear incompatibilities and mating systems play in explaining contrasting nuclear gene flow.",Tracking genetic diversity in a large-scale oyster restoration program: effects of hatchery propagation and initial characterization of diversity on restored vs. wild reefs.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833745,Heredity,2019 03 20,"The release of hatchery-propagated fish and shellfish is occurring on a global scale, but the genetic impacts of these practices are often not fully understood and rarely monitored. Slow recovery of depleted eastern oyster populations in the Chesapeake Bay, USA has prompted a hatchery-based restoration program focused in the Choptank River, Maryland consisting of the mass release of hatchery-produced juveniles from local, wild broodstock. To evaluate potential genetic effects of this program, we (1) examined changes in genetic diversity (allelic richness, heterozygosity) and the effective number of breeders (Nb) over the hatchery production cycle with microsatellite-based parentage of natural, mass- and controlled-spawned cohorts, and (2) compared genetic diversity and effective population size (Ne) of a restored reef to wild source populations. Mass-spawned cohorts showed high variance in reproductive contribution, particularly among males, leading to a 45% average reduction in Nb from spawning adult numbers and higher relatedness-lower magnitude reductions in heterozygosity and significant reductions in allelic richness were also observed. While controlled-spawns (single-male fertilizations of pooled eggs) reduced male variance, overall reproductive variance (Vk) remained high. Finally, oysters sampled from a restored reef displayed comparable Ne, genetic diversity, and relatedness to samples from wild populations, with no significant genetic differentiation among them. Overall, the hatchery-based results and initial field-based population genetic analyses suggest that despite reductions in diversity from parents to offspring owing to high Vk, enhancement with rotated, wild broodstock appears to have maintained genetic diversity in a restored reef population compared to proximal wild populations.",Genetic introgression among differentiated clades is lower among clades exhibiting different parity modes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833744,Heredity,2019 05 03,"Mechanisms leading to sympatric speciation are diverse and may build up reproductive isolation. Reproductive isolation among differentiated clades may exist due to genetic incompatibilities, sexual selection, differences in parity mode, reduced post-zygotic survival or reproductive success of hybrids. Here, we test whether differences in parity mode lead to reproductive isolation by investigating introgression in Zootoca vivipara, a lizard species exhibiting oviparous and viviparous reproduction. We measured introgression in transects spanning different viviparous clades, different oviparous subclades, transects containing oviparous and viviparous clades, and transects within the same subclade (control transects). Introgression in transects spanning oviparous and viviparous clades was one order of magnitude smaller than transects spanning the same reproductive mode and no statistical differences existed between transects spanning the same reproductive mode and control transects. Among types of transects, no significant differences existed in genetic and geographic distances, nor number of detected alleles. Moreover, hybrids were detected in all types of transects, showing that parity mode alone does not necessarily lead to complete reproductive isolation, which suggests that reinforcement may play an important role. The evolution of different parity modes together with reinforcement may thus promote reproductive isolation and rapid speciation, potentially explaining why only six of the almost 40,000 vertebrates belonging to groups consisting of viviparous and oviparous species exhibit bimodal reproduction.",The role of checkpoint blockade after allogeneic stem cell transplantation in diseases other than Hodgkin's Lymphoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833743,Bone marrow transplantation,2019 03 05,"Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is the only curative treatment option for many malignant high-risk hematological diseases. The Graft-vs.-Tumor (GvT) effect is the major hallmark of this treatment approach. However, disease relapse remains a major limitation. Boosting the GvT effect by checkpoint inhibitors (CI) is an attractive option in this desperate situation although potentially triggering Graft-vs.-Host Disease (GvHD). Early reports in patients with Hodgkin's lymphoma support the idea that CI therapy after HSCT is feasible and effective. We have retrospectively analyzed CI therapy for treatment of disease recurrence after allo-HSCT other than Hodgkin's lymphoma including 21 patients from eight German transplant centers. The median follow-up was 59 days. The overall response rate (ORR) was 43%. Patients receiving donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) in combination with CI had superior response (ORR 80%). Severe acute GvHD grade III-IV and moderate to severe chronic GvHD were observed in 29% of all patients. Taken together, CI therapy in relapsed patients after HSCT, especially in combination with DLI, is effective but induces severe GvHD in a considerable proportion of patients. Thus, prospective trials or EBMT registry-based validation of different dosing and application schedules including immunosuppressive regimens in those patients are urgently needed.",The European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) consensus recommendations for donor selection in haploidentical hematopoietic cell transplantation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833742,Bone marrow transplantation,2019 03 20,"The number of HLA-haploidentical hematopoietic cell transplants continues to increase worldwide due to recent improvements in outcomes, allowing more patients with hematological malignancies and non-malignant disorders to benefit from this procedure and have a chance to cure their disease. Despite these encouraging results, questions remain as multiple donors are usually available for transplantation, and choosing the best HLA-haploidentical donor for transplantation remains a challenge. Several approaches to haploidentical transplantation have been developed over time and, based on the graft received, can be grouped as follows: T-cell depleted haploidentical transplants, either complete or partial, or with T-cell replete grafts, performed with post-transplant cyclophosphamide-based graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis, or G-CSF-primed bone marrow graft and enhanced GVHD prophylaxis. Carefully selecting the donor can help optimize transplant outcomes for recipients of haploidentical donor transplants. Variables usually considered in the donor selection include presence of donor-specific antibodies in the recipient, donor age, donor/recipient gender and ABO combinations, and immunogenic variables, such as natural killer cell alloreactivity or KIR haplotype. Here we provide a comprehensive review of available evidence for selecting haploidentical donors for transplantation, and summarize the recommendations from the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) on donor selection for different transplant platforms.",Random anti-lasing through coherent perfect absorption in a disordered medium.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833737,Nature,2019 03 20,"Non-Hermitian wave engineering is a recent and fast-moving field that examines both fundamental and application-oriented phenomena1-7. One such phenomenon is coherent perfect absorption8-11-an effect commonly referred to as 'anti-lasing' because it corresponds to the time-reversed process of coherent emission of radiation at the lasing threshold (where all radiation losses are exactly balanced by the optical gain). Coherent perfect absorbers (CPAs) have been experimentally realized in several setups10-18, with the notable exception of a CPA in a disordered medium (a medium without engineered structure). Such a 'random CPA' would be the time-reverse of a 'random laser'19,20, in which light is resonantly enhanced by multiple scattering inside a disorder. Because of the complexity of this scattering process, the light field emitted by a random laser is also spatially complex and not focused like a regular laser beam. Realizing a random CPA (or 'random anti-laser') is therefore challenging because it requires the equivalent of time-reversing such a light field in all its degrees of freedom to create coherent radiation that is perfectly absorbed when impinging on a disordered medium. Here we use microwave technology to build a random anti-laser and demonstrate its ability to absorb suitably engineered incoming radiation fields with near-perfect efficiency. Because our approach to determining these field patterns is based solely on far-field measurements of the scattering properties of a disordered medium, it could be suitable for other applications in which waves need to be perfectly focused, routed or absorbed.",Application of a robotic THz imaging system for sub-surface analysis of ancient human remains.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833736,Scientific reports,2019 03 08,"We used a robotic-based THz imaging system to investigate the sub-surface structure of an artificially mummified ancient Egyptian human left hand. The results obtained are compared to the results of a conventional CT and a micro-CT scan. Using such a robotic THz system promises new insights into the sub-surface structure of human remains. The depth resolution of the THz images exceeds the resolution of a conventional CT scan and is comparable with a micro-CT scan. The advantage of THz measurements over micro-CT scans is the fact that even comparatively large samples, like complete bodies, can be scanned. These would not fit into a conventional micro-CT scanner.",Past and future spread of the arbovirus vectors Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833735,Nature microbiology,2019 06 10,"The global population at risk from mosquito-borne diseases-including dengue, yellow fever, chikungunya and Zika-is expanding in concert with changes in the distribution of two key vectors: Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus. The distribution of these species is largely driven by both human movement and the presence of suitable climate. Using statistical mapping techniques, we show that human movement patterns explain the spread of both species in Europe and the United States following their introduction. We find that the spread of Ae. aegypti is characterized by long distance importations, while Ae. albopictus has expanded more along the fringes of its distribution. We describe these processes and predict the future distributions of both species in response to accelerating urbanization, connectivity and climate change. Global surveillance and control efforts that aim to mitigate the spread of chikungunya, dengue, yellow fever and Zika viruses must consider the so far unabated spread of these mosquitos. Our maps and predictions offer an opportunity to strategically target surveillance and control programmes and thereby augment efforts to reduce arbovirus burden in human populations globally."

To systematically examine this modulation in HIV infection, we used isobaric tag-based mass spectrometry to quantify changes in the abundance of over 14,000 proteins during HIV-1 infection of human primary CD4+ T cells. We identified P-selectin glycoprotein ligand 1 (PSGL-1) as an HIV-1 restriction factor downregulated by HIV-1 Vpu, which binds to PSGL-1 and induces its ubiquitination and degradation through the ubiquitin ligase SCFβ-TrCP2. PSGL-1 is induced by interferon-γ in activated CD4+ T cells to inhibit HIV-1 reverse transcription and potently block viral infectivity by incorporating in progeny virions. This infectivity block is antagonized by Vpu via PSGL-1 degradation. We further show that PSGL-1 knockdown can significantly abolish the anti-HIV activity of interferon-γ in primary CD4+ T cells. Our study identifies an HIV restriction factor and a key mediator of interferon-γ's anti-HIV activity.",Airborne microbial transport limitation to isolated Antarctic soil habitats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833723,Nature microbiology,2019 05 23,"Dispersal is a critical yet poorly understood factor underlying macroecological patterns in microbial communities1. Airborne microbial transport is assumed to occupy a central role in determining dispersal outcomes2,3, and extra-range dispersal has important implications for predicting ecosystem resilience and response to environmental change4. One of the most pertinent biomes in this regard is Antarctica, given its geographic isolation and vulnerability to climate change and human disturbance5. Here, we report microbial diversity in near-ground and high-altitude air above the largest ice-free Antarctic habitat, as well as that of underlying soil microbial communities. We found that persistent local airborne inputs were unable to fully explain Antarctic soil community assembly. Comparison with airborne microbial diversity from high-altitude and non-polar sources suggests that strong selection occurs during long-range atmospheric transport. The influence of selection during airborne transit and at sink locations varied between microbial phyla. Overall, the communities from this isolated Antarctic ecosystem displayed limited connectivity to the non-polar microbial pool, and alternative sources of recruitment are necessary to fully explain extant soil diversity. Our findings provide critical insights into the role of airborne transport limitation in determining microbial biogeographic patterns.",Merits and pitfalls of conventional and covalent docking in identifying new hydroxyl aryl aldehyde like compounds as human IRE1 inhibitors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833722,Scientific reports,2019 03 08,"IRE1 is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) bound transmembrane bifunctional kinase and endoribonuclease protein crucial for the unfolded protein response (UPR) signaling pathway. Upon ER stress, IRE1 homodimerizes, oligomerizes and autophosphorylates resulting in endoribonuclease activity responsible for excision of a 26 nucleotide intron from the X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1) mRNA. This unique splicing mechanism results in activation of the XBP1s transcription factor to specifically restore ER stress. Small molecules targeting the reactive lysine residue (Lys907) in IRE1α's RNase domain have been shown to inhibit the cleavage of XBP1 mRNA. Crystal structures of murine IRE1 in complex with covalently bound hydroxyl aryl aldehyde (HAA) inhibitors show that these molecules form hydrophobic interactions with His910 and Phe889, a hydrogen bond with Tyr892 and an indispensable Schiff-base with Lys907. The availability of such data prompted interest in exploring structure-based drug design as a strategy to develop new covalently binding ligands. We extensively evaluated conventional and covalent docking for drug discovery targeting the catalytic site of the RNase domain. The results indicate that neither computational approach is fully successful in the current case, and we highlight herein the potential and limitations of the methods for the design of novel IRE1 RNase binders.",Non-chemisorbed gold-sulfur binding prevails in self-assembled monolayers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833721,Nature chemistry,2019 04 25,"Gold-thiol contacts are ubiquitous across the physical and biological sciences in connecting organic molecules to surfaces. When thiols bind to gold in self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) the fate of the hydrogen remains a subject of profound debate-with implications for our understanding of their physical properties, spectroscopic features and formation mechanism(s). Exploiting measurements of the transmission through a molecular junction, which is highly sensitive to the nature of the molecule-electrode contact, we demonstrate here that the nature of the gold-sulfur bond in SAMs can be probed via single-molecule conductance measurements. Critically, we find that SAM measurements of dithiol-terminated molecular junctions yield a significantly lower conductance than solution measurements of the same molecule. Through numerous control experiments, conductance noise analysis and transport calculations based on density functional theory, we show that the gold-sulfur bond in SAMs prepared from the solution deposition of dithiols does not have chemisorbed character, which strongly suggests that under these widely used preparation conditions the hydrogen is retained.",α-Fluorination of carbonyls with nucleophilic fluorine.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833720,Nature chemistry,2019 04 25,"Given the unique properties of fluorine, and the ability of fluorination to change the properties of organic molecules, there is significant interest from medicinal chemists in innovative methodologies that enable the synthesis of new fluorinated motifs. State-of-the-art syntheses of α-fluorinated carbonyl compounds invariably rely on electrophilic fluorinating agents, which can be strongly oxidizing and difficult to handle. Here we show that reversing the polarity of the enolate partner to that of an enolonium enables nucleophilic fluorinating agents to be used for direct chemoselective α-C-H-fluorination of amides. Reduction of these products enables facile access to β-fluorinated amines and the value of this methodology is shown by the easy preparation of a number of fluorinated analogues of drugs and agrochemicals. A fluorinated analogue of citalopram, a marketed antidepressant drug, is presented as an example of the preserved biological activity after fluorination.","Braiding, branching and chiral amplification of nanofibres in supramolecular gels.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833719,Nature chemistry,2019 04 25,"Helical nanofibres play key roles in many biological processes. Entanglements between helices can aid gelation by producing thick, interconnected fibres, but the details of this process are poorly understood. Here, we describe the assembly of an achiral oligo(urea) peptidomimetic compound into supramolecular helices. Aggregation of adjacent helices leads to the formation of fibrils, which further intertwine to produce high-fidelity braids with periodic crossing patterns. A braid theory analysis suggests that braiding is governed by rigid topological constraints, and that branching occurs due to crossing defects in the developing braids. Mixed-chirality helices assemble into relatively complex, odd-stranded braids, but can also form helical bundles by undergoing inversions of chirality. The oligo(urea) assemblies are also highly sensitive to chiral amplification, proposed to occur through a majority-rules mechanism, whereby trace chiral materials can promote the formation of gels containing only homochiral helices.",Ion-mediated hydrogen-bond rearrangement through tunnelling in the iodide-dihydrate complex.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833718,Nature chemistry,2019 04 25,"A microscopic picture of hydrogen-bond structure and dynamics in ion hydration shells remains elusive. Small ion-dihydrate molecular complexes are ideal systems with which to investigate the interplay and competition between ion-water and water-water interactions. Here, state-of-the-art quantum dynamics simulations provide evidence for tunnelling in hydrogen-bond rearrangements in the iodide-dihydrate complex and show that it can be controlled through isotopic substitutions. We find that the iodide ion weakens the neighbouring water-water hydrogen bond, leading to faster water reorientation than in the analogous water trimer. These faster dynamics, which are apparently at odds with the slowdown observed in the first hydration shell of iodide in solution, can be traced back to the presence of a free OH bond in the iodide-dihydrate complex, which effectively triggers the overall structural rearrangements within it. Besides providing indirect support for cooperative hydrogen-bond dynamics in iodide solutions, the analysis presented here suggests that iodide ions may accelerate hydrogen-bond rearrangements at aqueous interfaces, where neighbouring water molecules can be undercoordinated.",p300/CBP-associated factor promotes autophagic degradation of δ-catenin through acetylation and decreases prostate cancer tumorigenicity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833716,Scientific reports,2019 03 08,"δ-Catenin shares common binding partners with β-catenin. As acetylation and deacetylation regulate β-catenin stability, we searched for histone acetyltransferases (HATs) or histone deacetylases (HDACs) affecting δ-catenin acetylation status and protein levels. We showed that p300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF) directly bound to and acetylated δ-catenin, whereas several class I and class II HDACs reversed this effect. Unlike β-catenin, δ-catenin was downregulated by PCAF-mediated acetylation and upregulated by HDAC-mediated deacetylation. The HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A attenuated HDAC1-mediated δ-catenin upregulation, whereas HAT or autophagy inhibitors, but not proteasome inhibitors, abolished PCAF-mediated δ-catenin downregulation. The results suggested that PCAF-mediated δ-catenin acetylation promotes its autophagic degradation in an Atg5/LC3-dependent manner. Deletions or point mutations identified several lysine residues in different δ-catenin domains involved in PCAF-mediated δ-catenin downregulation. PCAF overexpression in prostate cancer cells markedly reduced δ-catenin levels and suppressed cell growth and motility. PCAF-mediated δ-catenin downregulation inhibited E-cadherin processing and decreased the nuclear distribution of β-catenin, resulting in the suppression of β-catenin/LEF-1-mediated downstream effectors. These data demonstrate that PCAF downregulates δ-catenin by promoting its autophagic degradation and suppresses δ-catenin-mediated oncogenic signals.",Legibility Assessment of Visual Word Form Symbols for Visual Tests.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833715,Scientific reports,2019 03 08,"For a reliable visual test, it is important to evaluate the legibility of the symbols, which depends on several factors. Previous studies have compared the legibility of Latin optotypes. This study developed a visual function test based on identification visual capacity for a Chinese reading population. The legibility of word symbols was assessed with three methods: (1) Identification of the contrast thresholds of the character sets, (2) patterns of confusion matrices obtained from analysis of the frequency of incorrect stimulus/response pairs, and (3) pixel ratios of bitmap images of Chinese characters. Then characters of similar legibility in each character set were selected. The contrast thresholds of the final five character sets and the Tumbling E and Landolt C optotypes were evaluated. No significant differences in contrast threshold were found among the five selected character sets (p > 0.05), but the contrast thresholds were significantly higher than those of the E and C optotypes. Our results indicate that combining multiple methods to include the influences of the properties of visual stimuli would be useful in investigating the legibility of visual word symbols.",The Impact of Varying Cooling and Thawing Rates on the Quality of Cryopreserved Human Peripheral Blood T Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833714,Scientific reports,2019 03 08,"For the clinical delivery of immunotherapies it is anticipated that cells will be cryopreserved and shipped to the patient where they will be thawed and administered. An established view in cellular cryopreservation is that following freezing, cells must be warmed rapidly (≤5 minutes) in order to maintain high viability. In this study we examine the interaction between the rate of cooling and rate of warming on the viability, and function of T cells formulated in a conventional DMSO based cryoprotectant and processed in conventional cryovials. The data obtained show that provided the cooling rate is -1 °C min-1 or slower, there is effectively no impact of warming rate on viable cell number within the range of warming rates examined (1.6 °C min-1 to 113 °C min-1). It is only following a rapid rate of cooling (-10 °C min-1) that a reduction in viable cell number is observed following slow rates of warming (1.6 °C min-1 and 6.2 °C min-1), but not rapid rates of warming (113 °C min-1 and 45 °C min-1). Cryomicroscopy studies revealed that this loss of viability is correlated with changes in the ice crystal structure during warming. At high cooling rates (-10 °C min-1) the ice structure appeared highly amorphous, and when subsequently thawed at slow rates (6.2 °C min-1 and below) ice recrystallization was observed during thaw suggesting mechanical disruption of the frozen cells. This data provides a fascinating insight into the crystal structure dependent behaviour during phase change of frozen cell therapies and its effect on live cell suspensions. Furthermore, it provides an operating envelope for the cryopreservation of T cells as an emerging industry defines formulation volumes and cryocontainers for immunotherapy products."

Our method leverages the modularity and scalability of enzyme-free DNA strand-displacement circuits to develop protocellular consortia that can sense, process and respond to DNA-based messages. We engineer a rich variety of biochemical communication devices capable of cascaded amplification, bidirectional communication and distributed computational operations. Encapsulating DNA strand-displacement circuits further allows their use in concentrated serum where non-compartmentalized DNA circuits cannot operate.

Recently, atomically thin semiconductors with a direct bandgap such as group VI-B transition-metal dichalcogenide monolayers have emerged as a platform for valleytronics-the study of the valley degree of freedom of charge carriers to store and control information. They offer optical, magnetic and electrical control of the valley index, which, with the spin, is locked into a robust spin-valley index3,4. However, because recombination lifetimes of photogenerated excitations in transition-metal dichalcogenides are of the order of a few picoseconds, optically generated valley excitons possess similar lifetimes. On the other hand, the valley polarization of free holes has a lifetime of microseconds5-9. Whereas progress has been made in optical control of the valley index in ensembles of charge carriers10-12, valley control of individual charges, which is crucial for valleytronics, remains unexplored. Here we provide unambiguous evidence for localized holes with a net spin in optically active WSe2 quantum dots13-17 and we initialize their spin-valley state with the helicity of the excitation laser under small magnetic fields. Under such conditions, we estimate a lower bound of the valley lifetime of a single charge in a quantum dot from the recombination time to be of the order of nanoseconds. Remarkably, neutral quantum dots do not exhibit such spin-valley initialization, which illustrates the role of the excess charge in prolonging the valley lifetime. Our work extends the field of two-dimensional valleytronics to the level of single spin- valleys, with implications for quantum information and sensing applications.",Miniature gold nanorods for photoacoustic molecular imaging in the second near-infrared optical window.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833692,Nature nanotechnology,2019 05 11,"In photoacoustic imaging, the second near-infrared (NIR-II) window is where tissue generates the least background signal. However, the large size of the few available contrast agents in this spectral range impedes their pharmacokinetics and decreases their thermal stability, leading to unreliable photoacoustic imaging. Here, we report the synthesis of miniaturized gold nanorods absorbing in the NIR-II that are 5-11 times smaller than regular-sized gold nanorods with a similar aspect ratio. Under nanosecond pulsed laser illumination, small nanorods are about 3 times more thermally stable and generate 3.5 times stronger photoacoustic signal than their absorption-matched larger counterparts. These unexpected findings are confirmed using theoretical and numerical analysis, showing that photoacoustic signal is not only proportional to the optical absorption of the nanoparticle solution but also to the surface-to-volume ratio of the nanoparticles. In living tumour-bearing mice, these small targeted nanorods display a 30% improvement in efficiency of agent delivery to tumours and generate 4.5 times greater photoacoustic contrast.",Tapered InP nanowire arrays for efficient broadband high-speed single-photon detection.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833690,Nature nanotechnology,2019 05 08,"Superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors with peak efficiencies above 90% and unrivalled timing jitter (<30 ps) have emerged as a potent technology for quantum information and sensing applications.

The truncated conical nanowire shape enables a broadband, linear photoresponse in the ultraviolet to near-infrared range (~500 nm bandwidth) with external quantum efficiencies exceeding 85%. The devices exhibit a high gain beyond 105, such that a single photon per pulse can be distinguished from the dark noise, while simultaneously showing a fast pulse rise time (<1 ns) and excellent timing jitter (<20 ps).

Field measurements indicate a large unknown source of HONO during the day time. Release of nitrous acid (HONO) from soil has been suggested as a major source of atmospheric HONO. We hypothesize that nitrite produced by biological nitrate reduction in oxygen-limited microzones in wet soils is a source of such HONO. Indeed, we found that various contrasting soil samples emitted HONO at high water-holding capacity (75-140%), demonstrating this to be a widespread phenomenon. Supplemental nitrate stimulated HONO emissions, whereas ethanol (70% v/v) treatment to minimize microbial activities reduced HONO emissions by 80%, suggesting that nitrate-dependent biotic processes are the sources of HONO. High-throughput Illumina sequencing of 16S rRNA as well as functional gene transcripts associated with nitrate and nitrite reduction indicated that HONO emissions from soil samples were associated with nitrate reduction activities of diverse Proteobacteria. Incubation of pure cultures of bacterial nitrate reducers and gene-expression analyses, as well as the analyses of mutant strains deficient in nitrite reductases, showed positive correlations of HONO emissions with the capability of microbes to reduce nitrate to nitrite. Thus, we suggest biological nitrate reduction in oxygen-limited microzones as a hitherto unknown source of atmospheric HONO, affecting biogeochemical nitrogen cycling, atmospheric chemistry, and global modeling.",Unraveling the biophysical underpinnings to the success of multispecies biofilms in porous environments.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833685,The ISME journal,2019 03 05,"Biofilms regulate critical processes in porous ecosystems. However, the biophysical underpinnings of the ecological success of these biofilms are poorly understood. Combining experiments with fluidic devices, sequencing and modeling, we reveal that architectural plasticity enhances space exploitation by multispecies biofilms in porous environments. Biofilms consistently differentiated into an annular base biofilm coating the grains and into streamers protruding from the grains into the pore space. Although different flow-related processes governed the differentiation of these architectures, both BB and streamers were composed of similar bacterial assemblages. This is evidence for architectural plasticity. Architectural plasticity allowed for complementary use of the space provided by the grain-pore complexes, which increased biofilm carrying capacity at the larger scale of the porous system. This increase comes potentially at the cost of a tradeoff. Contrasting time scales of oxygen replenishment and consumption, we show that streamers locally inhibit the growth of the BB downstream from the grains. Our study provides first insights into the biophysical underpinnings to the success of multispecies biofilms in porous environments.","Evidence for the homogeneous ferromagnetic phase in (Ga,Mn)(Bi,As) epitaxial layers from muon spin relaxation spectroscopy.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833684,Scientific reports,2019 03 08,"Ferromagnetic semiconductor thin layers of the quaternary (Ga,Mn)(Bi,As) and reference, ternary (Ga,Mn)As compounds, epitaxially grown under either compressive or tensile strain, have been characterized from a perspective of structural and magnetization homogeneity. The quality and composition of the layers have been confirmed by secondary-ion mass spectrometry (SIMS). A thorough evaluation of the magnetic properties as a function of temperature and applied magnetic field has been performed by means of SQUID magnetometry and low-energy muon spin relaxation (µSR) spectroscopy, which enables studying local (on the nanometer scale) magnetic properties of the layers. The results testify that the ferromagnetic order builds up almost homogeneously below the Curie temperature in the full volume fraction of both the (Ga,Mn)As and (Ga,Mn)(Bi,As) layers. Incorporation of a small amount of heavy Bi atoms into (Ga,Mn)As, which distinctly enhances the strength of spin-orbit coupling in the quaternary (Ga,Mn)(Bi,As) layers, does not deteriorate noticeably their magnetic properties.",On the processes influencing rapid intensity changes of tropical cyclones over the Bay of Bengal.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833683,Scientific reports,2019 03 08,"We present a numerical investigation of the processes that influenced the contrasting rapid intensity changes in Tropical Cyclones (TC) Phailin and Lehar (2013) over the Bay of Bengal. Our emphasis is on the significant differences in the environments experienced by the TCs within a few weeks and the consequent differences in their organization of vortex-scale convection that resulted in their different rapid intensity changes. The storm-relative proximity, intensity, and depth of the subtropical ridge resulted in the establishment of a low-sheared environment for Phailin and a high-sheared environment for Lehar. Our primary finding here is that in Lehar's sheared vortex, the juxtaposition in the azimuthal phasing of the asymmetrically distributed downward eddy flux of moist-entropy through the top of the boundary layer, and the radial eddy flux of moist-entropy within the boundary layer in the upshear left-quadrant of Lehar (40-80 km radius) establishes a pathway for the low moist-entropy air to intrude into the vortex from the environment. Conversely, when the azimuthal variations in boundary layer moist-entropy, inflow, and convection are weak in Phailin's low-sheared environment, the inflow magnitude and radial location of boundary layer convergence relative to the radius of maximum wind dictated the rapid intensification.",Spatiotemporal patterns of extreme sea levels along the western North-Atlantic coasts.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833680,Scientific reports,2019 03 08,"The western North-Atlantic coast experienced major coastal floods in recent years. Coastal floods are primarily composed of tides and storm surges due to tropical (TCs) and extra-tropical cyclones (ETCs). We present a reanalysis from 1988 to 2015 of extreme sea levels that explicitly include TCs for the western North-Atlantic coastline. Validation shows a good agreement between modeled and observed sea levels and demonstrates that the framework can capture large-scale variability in extreme sea levels. We apply the 28-year reanalysis to analyze spatiotemporal patterns. Along the US Atlantic coasts the contribution of tides can be significant, with the average contribution of tides during the 10 largest events up to 55% in some locations, whereas along the Mexican Southern Gulf coast, the average contribution of tides over the largest 10 events is generally below 25%. At the US Atlantic coast, ETCs are responsible for 8.5 out of the 10 largest extreme events, whereas at the Gulf Coast and Caribbean TCs dominate. During the TC season more TC-driven events exceed a 10-year return period. During winter, there is a peak in ETC-driven events. Future research directions include coupling the framework with synthetic tropical cyclone tracks and extension to the global scale."

Here we describe that inhibition of mutant KRAS promotes MEK nuclear localization as an alternative mechanism of KRAS-targeted drugs resistance. Tissue microarray analysis in colon tumours shows that aberrant MEK nuclear localization is closely related to YAP levels and tumour malignancy. MEK nuclear localization could sequester β-TrCP from cytoplasmic inactive YAP, then stabilizing YAP. Mutant KRAS restrains MEK within the cytoplasm via IQGAP1, inhibiting MEK nuclear translocation. Trametinib, an allosteric MEK inhibitor, could prevent MEK nuclear localization and subsequently promote YAP degradation. In vitro and in vivo results suggests that inhibition of MEK nuclear localization by trametinib synergizes with KRAS knockdown or deltarasin treatment in suppressing the viability of KRAS mutant colon cancer cells. Our study provides new insights into the mechanisms of resistance to KRAS ablation, and suggests novel strategies for the treatment of KRAS-mutant colon cancers.",The mechanism of eutectic modification by trace impurities.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833664,Scientific reports,2019 03 08,"In the quest toward rational design of materials, establishing direct links between the attributes of microscopic building blocks and the macroscopic performance limits of the bulk structures they comprise is essential. Building blocks of concern to the field of crystallization are the impurities, foreign ingredients that are either deliberately added to or naturally present in the growth medium. While the role of impurities has been studied extensively in various materials systems, the inherent complexity of eutectic crystallization in the presence of trace, often metallic impurities ('eutectic modification') remains poorly understood. In particular, the origins behind the drastic microstructural changes observed upon modification are elusive. Herein, we employ an integrated imaging approach to shed light on the influence of trace metal impurities during the growth of an irregular (faceted-non-faceted) eutectic. Our dynamic and 3D synchrotron-based X-ray imaging results reveal the markedly different microstructural and, for the first time, topological properties of the eutectic constituents that arise upon modification, not fully predicted by the existing theories. Together with ex situ crystallographic characterization of the fully-solidified specimen, our multi-modal study provides a unified picture of eutectic modification: The impurities selectively alter the stacking sequence of the faceted phase, thereby inhibiting its steady-state growth. Consequently, the non-faceted phase advances deeper into the melt, eventually engulfing the faceted phase in its wake. We present a quantitative topological framework to rationalize these experimental observations.",Integrated Analysis of Whole Exome Sequencing and Copy Number Evaluation in Parkinson's Disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833663,Scientific reports,2019 03 08,"Genetic studies of the familial forms of Parkinson's disease (PD) have identified a number of causative genes with an established role in its pathogenesis.

In this study we describe whole exome sequencing (WES) genetic findings of 60 PD patients with 125 variants validated in 51 of these cases. We used strict criteria for variant categorization that generated a list of variants in 20 genes. These variants included loss of function and missense changes in 18 genes that were never previously linked to PD (NOTCH4, BCOR, ITM2B, HRH4, CELSR1, SNAP91, FAM174A, BSN, SPG7, MAGI2, HEPHL1, EPRS, PUM1, CLSTN1, PLCB3, CLSTN3, DNAJB9 and NEFH) and 2 genes that were previously associated with PD (EIF4G1 and ATP13A2). These genes either play a critical role in neuronal function and/or have mouse models with disease related phenotypes.

In an effort to exploit MYC as a therapeutic target, including in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), strategies have been developed on the basis of MYC amplification or gene translocation. Due to the failure of these strategies to provide accurate diagnostics and prognostic value, we have developed a Negative Elongation Factor E (NELFE)-Dependent MYC Target (NDMT) gene signature. This signature, which consists of genes regulated by MYC and NELFE, an RNA binding protein that enhances MYC-induced hepatocarcinogenesis, is predictive of NELFE/MYC-driven tumors that would otherwise not be identified by gene amplification or translocation alone. We demonstrate the utility of the NDMT gene signature to predict a unique subtype of HCC, which is associated with a poor prognosis in three independent cohorts encompassing diverse etiologies, demographics, and viral status.

This intracellular noise is detrimental to precise regulation. To maintain the proper function of a cell, some natural motifs attenuate the noise at the protein level. In many biological systems, the protein monomer is used as a regulator, but the protein dimer also exists. In the present study, we demonstrated that the dimerization reaction reduces the noise intensity of the protein monomer. Compared with two common noise-buffering motifs, the incoherent feedforward loop (FFL) and negative feedback control, the coefficient of variation (COV) in the case of dimerization was 25% less. Furthermore, we examined a system with direct interaction between proteins and other ligands. Both the incoherent FFL and negative feedback control failed to buffer the noise, but the dimerization was effective. Remarkably, the formation of only one protein dimer was sufficient to cause a 7.5% reduction in the COV.",Probing the effects of nonannular lipid binding on the stability of the calcium pump SERCA.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833659,Scientific reports,2019 03 09,"The calcium pump SERCA is a transmembrane protein that is critical for calcium transport in cells. SERCA resides in an environment made up largely by the lipid bilayer, so lipids play a central role on its stability and function. Studies have provided insights into the effects of annular and bulk lipids on SERCA activation, but the role of a nonannular lipid site in the E2 intermediate state remains elusive. Here, we have performed microsecond molecular dynamics simulations to probe the effects of nonannular lipid binding on the stability and structural dynamics of the E2 state of SERCA. We found that the structural integrity and stability of the E2 state is independent of nonannular lipid binding, and that occupancy of a lipid molecule at this site does not modulate destabilization of the E2 state, a step required to initiate the transition toward the competent E1 state. We also found that binding of the nonannular lipid does not induce direct allosteric control of the intrinsic functional dynamics the E2 state. We conclude that nonannular lipid binding is not necessary for the stability of the E2 state, but we speculate that it becomes functionally significant during the E2-to-E1 transition of the pump.",Genome-wide target specificity of CRISPR RNA-guided adenine base editors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833658,Nature biotechnology,2019 04 23,"Adenine base editors1 enable efficient targeted adenine-to-guanine single nucleotide conversions to induce or correct point mutations in human cells, animals, and plants1-4.

To produce double-strand breaks at sites containing inosines, the products of adenine deamination, we treat human genomic DNA with an adenine base editor 7.10 protein-guide RNA complex and either endonuclease V or a combination of human alkyladenine DNA glycosylase and endonuclease VIII in vitro. Digenome-seq detects adenine base editor off-target sites with a substitution frequency of 0.1% or more. We show that adenine base editor 7.10, the cytosine base editor BE3, and unmodified CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) often recognize different off-target sites, highlighting the need for independent assessments of their genome-wide specificities6. Using targeted sequencing, we also show that use of preassembled adenine base editor ribonucleoproteins, modified guide RNAs5,8-11, and Sniper/Cas9 (ref. 12) reduces adenine base editor off-target activity in human cells.",Longitudinal tracking and quantification of individual Plasmodium falciparum clones in complex infections.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833657,Scientific reports,2019 03 08,"Longitudinal tracking of individual Plasmodium falciparum strains in multi-clonal infections is essential for investigating infection dynamics of malaria. The traditional genotyping techniques did not permit tracking changes in individual clone density during persistent natural infections. Amplicon deep sequencing (Amp-Seq) offers a tool to address this knowledge gap. The sensitivity of Amp-Seq for relative quantification of clones was investigated using three molecular markers, ama1-D2, ama1-D3, and cpmp. Amp-Seq and length-polymorphism based genotyping were compared for their performance in following minority clones in longitudinal samples from Papua New Guinea. Amp-Seq markers were superior to length-polymorphic marker msp2 in detecting minority clones (sensitivity Amp-Seq: 95%, msp2: 85%). Multiplicity of infection (MOI) by Amp-Seq was 2.32 versus 1.73 for msp2. The higher sensitivity had no effect on estimates of force of infection because missed minority clones were detected in preceding or succeeding bleeds. Individual clone densities were tracked longitudinally by Amp-Seq despite MOI > 1, thus providing an additional parameter for investigating malaria infection dynamics. Amp-Seq based genotyping of longitudinal samples improves detection of minority clones and estimates of MOI. Amp-Seq permits tracking of clone density over time to study clone competition or the dynamics of specific, i.e. resistance-associated genotypes.",Morphological characteristics of vasculogenic mimicry and its correlation with EphA2 expression in gastric adenocarcinoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833656,Scientific reports,2019 03 08,"Genetically deregulated tumor cells generate vascular channels by vasculogenic mimicry (VM) that is independent of endothelial blood vessels.

It has long been believed that VM consists of PAS-positive basement membrane and CD31/CD34-negative cells. Interestingly, we found that the luminal surface of gastric tumor cells that form VM channels showed PAS-positive reaction, and that the involvement of CD31/CD34-positive tumor cells in the formation of VM channels. Highly aggressive tumor cells that formed VM were found to express CD31 or CD34, implicating the angiogenic and vasculogenic potential of the genetically deregulated tumor cells. VM occurrence was positively correlated with high expression of EphA2 in our patient cohort, and the indispensable role of EphA2 in VM formation was identified by gene silencing in AGS cells. We also report that Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-positive tumor cells were involved in the formation of VM channels in EBV-associated gastric cancer samples. Overall, our results suggest that EphA2 signaling promotes tumor metastasis by inducing VM formation during gastric tumorigenesis."

There was a significant difference in morphology between the sclerotia and the termite eggs. The workers of R. labralis and R. chinensis actively gathered the sclerotia into the egg piles within their nests, whereas the workers of R. aculabialis did not gather sclerotia outside their nests. None of the sclerotia in the egg piles germinated in the presence of workers. However, the sclerotia germinated in the absence of workers, and then the hyphae killed the termite eggs. The data from cellulase activity demonstrated that Fibulorhizoctonia sp. was able to exhaustively digest cellulose into glucose.We confirmed for the first time that the workers carrying the sclerotia into the piles of eggs is not due to mistaking the sclerotia for their eggs and that the workers of R. labralis may be able to select favourite fungi.",Efficient [Formula: see text] adsorption using peach stone-derived granular activated carbon.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833642,Scientific reports,2019 03 08,"Agricultural wastes have attracted attention as alternative precursors for the production of granular activated carbon.

The present study explored the cellular effects of 4HR on RAW 264.7 cells by immunoprecipitation high-performance liquid chromatography (IP-HPLC) using 216 antisera. 4HR-treated cells showed significant decreases in the expressions of proliferation-related proteins, cMyc/MAX/MAD network, p53/Rb/E2F and Wnt/β-catenin signalings, epigenetic modifications, and protein translation. Furthermore, 4HR suppressed the expressions of growth factors and proteins associated with RAS signaling, NFkB signaling, inflammation, and osteogenesis, but elevated the expressions of proteins associated with p53-mediated and FAS-mediated apoptosis, T-cell immunity, angiogenesis, antioxidant, and oncogenic signaling. In a 4HR adherence assay, TNFα, PKC, osteopontin, and GADD45 were strongly adherent to 4HR-coated beads, whereas IL-6, c-caspase 3, CDK4, and c-caspase 9 were not. Many 4HR adherent proteins were expressed at lower levels in 4HR treated RAW 264.7 cells than in non-treated controls, whereas 4HR non-adherent proteins were expressed at higher levels. These observations suggest 4HR affects the expressions of proteins in an adhesion-dependent manner and that its effects on proteins are characteristic and global in RAW 264.7 cells.",Reduced habit-driven errors in Parkinson's Disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833640,Scientific reports,2019 03 08,"Parkinson's Disease can be understood as a disorder of motor habits. A prediction of this theory is that early stage Parkinson's patients will display fewer errors caused by interference from previously over-learned behaviours. We test this prediction in the domain of skilled typing, where actions are easy to record and errors easy to identify. We describe a method for categorizing errors as simple motor errors or habit-driven errors. We test Spanish and English participants with and without Parkinson's, and show that indeed patients make fewer habit errors than healthy controls, and, further, that classification of error type increases the accuracy of discriminating between patients and healthy controls. As well as being a validation of a theory-led prediction, these results offer promise for automated, enhanced and early diagnosis of Parkinson's Disease.",HER2 and p95HER2 differentially regulate miRNA expression in MCF-7 breast cancer cells and downregulate MYB proteins through miR-221/222 and miR-503.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833639,Scientific reports,2019 03 08,"The HER2 oncogene and its truncated form p95HER2 play central roles in breast cancer. Here, we show that although HER2 and p95HER2 generally elicit qualitatively similar changes in miRNA profile in MCF-7 breast cancer cells, a subset of changes are distinct and p95HER2 shifts the miRNA profile towards the basal breast cancer subtype. High-throughput miRNA profiling was carried out 15, 36 and 60 h after HER2 or p95HER2 expression and central hits validated by RT-qPCR. miRNAs strongly regulated by p95HER2 yet not by HER2, included miR-221, miR-222, miR-503, miR-29a, miR-149, miR-196 and miR-361. Estrogen receptor-α (ESR1) expression was essentially ablated by p95HER2 expression, in a manner recapitulated by miR-221/-222 mimics. c-Myb family transcription factors MYB and MYBL1, but not MYBL2, were downregulated by p95HER2 and by miR-503 or miR-221/-222 mimics. MYBL1 3'UTR inhibition by miR-221/222 was lost by deletion of a single putative miR-221/222 binding sites. p95HER2 expression, or knockdown of either MYB protein, elicited upregulation of tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloprotease-2 (TIMP2). miR-221/222 and -503 mimics increased, and TIMP2 knockdown decreased, cell migration and invasion. A similar pathway was operational in T47D- and SKBr-3 cells. This work reveals important differences between HER2- and p95HER2- mediated miRNA changes in breast cancer cells, provides novel mechanistic insight into regulation of MYB family transcription factors by p95HER2, and points to a role for a miR-221/222- MYB family-TIMP2 axis in regulation of motility in breast cancer cells.",Cyclin D-CDK4 relieves cooperative repression of proliferation and cell cycle gene expression by DREAM and RB.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833638,Oncogene,2019 03 07,"The retinoblastoma protein (RB) restricts cell cycle gene expression and entry into the cell cycle. The RB-related protein p130 forms the DREAM (DP, RB-like, E2F, and MuvB) complex and contributes to repression of cell cycle-dependent genes during quiescence. Although both RB and DREAM bind and repress an overlapping set of E2F-dependent gene promoters, it remains unclear whether they cooperate to restrict cell cycle entry. To test the specific contributions of RB and DREAM, we generated RB and p130 knockout cells in primary human fibroblasts. Knockout of both p130 and RB yielded higher levels of cell cycle gene expression in G0 and G1 cells compared to cells with knockout of RB alone, indicating a role for DREAM and RB in repression of cell cycle genes. We observed that RB had a dominant role in E2F-dependent gene repression during mid to late G1 while DREAM activity was more prominent during G0 and early G1. Cyclin D-Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4 (CDK4)-dependent phosphorylation of p130 occurred during early G1, and led to the release of p130 and MuvB from E2F4 and decreased p130 and MuvB binding to cell cycle promoters. Specific inhibition of CDK4 activity by palbociclib blocked DREAM complex disassembly during cell cycle entry. In addition, sensitivity to CDK4 inhibition was dependent on RB and an intact DREAM complex in both normal cells as well as in palbociclib-sensitive cancer cell lines. Although RB knockout cells were partially resistant to CDK4 inhibition, RB and p130 double knockout cells were significantly more resistant to palbociclib treatment. These results indicate that DREAM cooperates with RB in repressing E2F-dependent gene expression and cell cycle entry and supports a role for DREAM as a therapeutic target in cancer.",Zero-reflection acoustic metamaterial with a negative refractive index.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833636,Scientific reports,2019 03 08,"Waves are reflected to varying degrees at the boundary between two different media. A reduction of this reflection is important for many materials, including acoustic metamaterials. Here, we theoretically develop a balanced acoustic metamaterial that exhibits zero reflection between the metamaterial and air over its entire refractive index range, regardless of the sign of the refractive index. The metamaterial is realized using unit cell structures containing membranes and open tubes, and the material performance is verified experimentally, demonstrating sound reflectance of less than 10% in the frequency region that satisfies the homogeneous medium condition. The zero-reflection characteristic of the acoustic balanced metamaterial can improve the performance of new acoustic devices such as the invisibility cloak and super-lens and can also contribute to basic research of acoustic metamaterials.",Women's preferences for men's facial masculinity are strongest under favorable ecological conditions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833635,Scientific reports,2019 03 08,"The strength of sexual selection on secondary sexual traits varies depending on prevailing economic and ecological conditions. In humans, cross-cultural evidence suggests women's preferences for men's testosterone dependent masculine facial traits are stronger under conditions where health is compromised, male mortality rates are higher and economic development is higher. Here we use a sample of 4483 exclusively heterosexual women from 34 countries and employ mixed effects modelling to test how social, ecological and economic variables predict women's facial masculinity preferences. We report women's preferences for more masculine looking men are stronger in countries with higher sociosexuality and where national health indices and human development indices are higher, while no associations were found between preferences and indices of intra-sexual competition. Our results show that women's preferences for masculine faces are stronger under conditions where offspring survival is higher and economic conditions are more favorable.",Use of vasopressor for dialysis-related hypotension is a risk factor for death in hemodialysis patients: Nationwide cohort study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833633,Scientific reports,2019 03 08,"Because hypotension during hemodialysis (HD) makes continuation of HD difficult and is associated with mortality, pressor approaches are necessary for patients with hypotension. However, the relationships between the pressor approaches and the risk of death have not been clarified yet. We analyzed data from a nationwide prospective cohort study of the Japanese Society for Dialysis Therapy Renal Data Registry (n = 29,309). The outcome was all-cause one-year death. The association between the use of pressor approaches and the outcome was examined using Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for baseline characteristics, propensity score matched analysis and Bayesian networks. The background features of the patients were as follows: male, 59.6%; average age, 64.5 ± 12.5 years; and patients with diabetes mellitus, 31.5%. The pressor group showed a higher risk of the outcome than the control group [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 1.33 (95% CI: 1.21, 1.47), p = 0.0001]. Propensity score matched analysis also showed that the matched-pressor group had a higher risk of the outcome than the matched-control group [aHR 1.30 (95% CI: 1.17, 1.45), p = 0.0001]. Moreover, the Bayesian network showed a direct causal relationship from the use of pressor approaches to the outcome. The use of oral vasopressors [aHR 1.20 (95% CI: 1.07, 1.35), p = 0.0018], intravenous injection of vasopressors [aHR 1.54 (95% CI: 1.32, 1.79), p = 0.0001] and normal saline [aHR 1.18 (95% CI: 1.05, 1.33), p = 0.0066] were associated with a high risk of the outcome. In conclusion, this study showed that the use of pressor approaches during HD may be an independent risk factor for death."

The seagrass was characterized by chemical and physical measurements that confirmed the acid-activation of seagrass. The favourable conditions for MB and Pb2+ adsorption onto the activated seagrass (SGa) were determined to be a pH range of 2-12 and ≥6, an adsorbent dosage of 3.0 and 0.5 g L-1, respectively, and a shaking time of 30 min, which are suitable for a wide range of wastewaters. The equilibrium data were analysed using the Langmuir, Freundlich and Dubinin-Raduskavich-Kaganer (DRK) adsorption isotherm models. The Freundlich and DRK models best describe the adsorption processes of MB and Pb2+, on SGa with capacities of 2681.9 and 631.13 mg g-1, respectively. The adsorption isotherm fitting and thermodynamic studies suggest that the adsorption mechanism of MB may combine electrostatic and physical multilayer adsorption processes, in which MB may be present as monomers as well as dimers and trimers which were confirmed from UV spectroscopy whereas Pb2+ is chemically adsorbed onto SGa. The pseudo-2nd-order kinetic model was utilized to investigate the kinetics of adsorption processes. The removal process was successfully applied for MB-spiked brackish waste water from Manzala Lake, Egypt, with removal efficiencies of 91.5-99.9%.",The effects of backpack carriage on gait kinematics and kinetics of schoolchildren.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833621,Scientific reports,2019 03 08,"There has been a growing concern among clinical and educational practitioners, as well as, policy makers on the use of backpacks by schoolchildren. On a daily basis, pupils spend a significant amount of time carrying stuffed and heavy backpacks. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of backpack carriage with different loads on spatiotemporal parameters of gait, plantar pressure and force distribution under different foot regions in schoolchildren. We have assessed fifty-seven primary school students (7-9 years-old) performing four walks of 10 m (carrying 0%, 10%, 15% of body mass in the backpack and the load they brought to school). A floor-based photocell system was used to collect the gait kinematics and insoles capacitive pressure sensors the kinetics. Children walked slower and at lower cadence with the load brought to school than in the other three conditions. There was no significant main effect on stride length. Backpack carriage with different loads did have a significant effect on plantar pressure and force distribution. We noted that heavier the load, higher the pressure and force under different foot regions. Our findings highlight that gait biomechanics of children (such as stride kinematics and pressure under the feet) is affected by carrying loads in the backpacks.",Identification of novel population clusters with different susceptibilities to type 2 diabetes and their impact on the prediction of diabetes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833619,Scientific reports,2019 03 08,"Type 2 diabetes is one of the subtypes of diabetes. However, previous studies have revealed its heterogeneous features. Here, we hypothesized that there would be heterogeneity in its development, resulting in higher susceptibility in some populations. We performed risk-factor based clustering (RFC), which is a hierarchical clustering of the population with profiles of five known risk factors for type 2 diabetes (age, gender, body mass index, hypertension, and family history of diabetes). The RFC identified six population clusters with significantly different prevalence rates of type 2 diabetes in the discovery data (N = 10,023), ranging from 0.09 to 0.44 (Chi-square test, P < 0.001). The machine learning method identified six clusters in the validation data (N = 215,083), which also showed the heterogeneity of prevalence between the clusters (P < 0.001). In addition to the prevalence of type 2 diabetes, the clusters showed different clinical features including biochemical profiles and prediction performance with the risk factors. SOur results seem to implicate a heterogeneous mechanism in the development of type 2 diabetes. These results will provide new insights for the development of more precise management strategy for type 2 diabetes.",Renal Damaging Effect Elicited by Bicalutamide Therapy Uncovered Multiple Action Mechanisms As Evidenced by the Cell Model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833616,Scientific reports,2019 03 08,"Bicalutamide (Bic) is frequently used in androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) for treating prostate cancer. ADT-induced hypogonadism was reported to have the potential to lead to acute kidney injury (AKI). ADT was also shown to induce bladder fibrosis via induction of the transforming growth factor (TGF)-β level. We hypothesized that Bic can likely induce renal fibrosis. To understand this, a cell model was used to explore expressions of relevant profibrotic proteins. Results indicated that Bic initiated multiple apoptotic and fibrotic pathways, including androgen deprivation, downregulation of the androgen receptor → phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase → Akt pathway, upregulation of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway- tumor necrosis factor α →  nuclear factor κB → caspase-3, increased expressions of fibrosis-related proteins including platelet-derived growth factor β, fibronectin and collagen IV, and enhanced cell migration. The endoplasmic reticular stress pathway and smooth muscle actin were unaffected by Bic. Co-treatment with testosterone was shown to have an anti-apoptotic effect against Bic, suggesting a better outcome of Bic therapy if administered with an appropriate testosterone intervention. However, since Bic was found to inhibit the membrane transport and consumption rates of testosterone, a slightly larger dose of testosterone is recommended. In conclusion, these pathways can be considered to be pharmaceutically relevant targets for drug development in treating the adverse effects of Bic.",A crystal plasticity FEM study of through-thickness deformation and texture in a {112} <111> aluminium single crystal during accumulative roll-bonding.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833615,Scientific reports,2019 03 08,"In this study, a crystal plasticity finite element method (CPFEM) model was used to study the deformation behaviour in an aluminium single crystal (1 1 2)[1 1 -1] processed by accumulative roll-bonding (ARB) up to 9 cycles. The simulation followed the real ARB process based on the developed finite element model. The predicted through-thickness texture matches well with the experimental observations. The deformation behaviours, in terms of crystal rotation, shear strain and slip system activation, in the first and second cycles (conventional rolling) were unidirectional, but the deformation was altered after ARB was applied from the third cycle onwards. Such alteration was found to be caused by the thickness position change and deformation discontinuity at interfaces, which were investigated in detail. The role that interfaces play became dominant over thickness position change as increasing ARB cycles.",Cationic Intrinsically Disordered Antimicrobial Peptides (CIDAMPs) Represent a New Paradigm of Innate Defense with a Potential for Novel Anti-Infectives.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833614,Scientific reports,2019 03 09,"In the search for potential mechanisms underlying the remarkable resistance of healthy skin against infection by soil bacteria like Pseudomonas (P.) aeruginosa we identified fragments of the intrinsically disordered protein hornerin as potent microbicidal agents in the stratum corneum. We found that, independent of the amino acid (AA)-sequence, any tested linear cationic peptide containing a high percentage of disorder-promoting AA and a low percentage of order-promoting AA is a potent microbicidal antimicrobial. We further show that the antimicrobial activity of these cationic intrinsically disordered antimicrobial peptides (CIDAMPs) depends on the peptide chain length, its net charge, lipidation and environmental conditions. The ubiquitous presence of latent CIDAMP sources in nature suggests a common and yet overlooked adapted innate disinfection system of body surfaces. The simple structure and virtually any imaginable sequence or composition of disorder-promoting AA allow the generation of a plethora of CIDAMPs. These are potential novel microbicidal anti-infectives for various bacterial pathogens, including P. aeruginosa, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and fungal pathogens like Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans.",Identification and genetic characterization of a novel Orthobunyavirus species by a straightforward high-throughput sequencing-based approach.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833612,Scientific reports,2019 03 08,"Identification and characterization of novel unknown viruses is of great importance. The introduction of high-throughput sequencing (HTS)-based methods has paved the way for genomics-based detection of pathogens without any prior assumptions about the characteristics of the organisms. However, the use of HTS for the characterization of viral pathogens from clinical samples remains limited. Here, we report the identification of a novel Orthobunyavirus species isolated from horse plasma. The identification was based on a straightforward HTS approach. Following enrichment in cell culture, RNA was extracted from the growth medium and rapid library preparation, HTS and primary bioinformatic analyses were performed in less than 12 hours. Taxonomical profiling of the sequencing reads did not reveal sequence similarities to any known virus. Subsequent application of de novo assembly tools to the sequencing reads produced contigs, of which three showed some similarity to the L, M, and S segments of viruses belonging to the Orthobunyavirus genus. Further refinement of these contigs resulted in high-quality, full-length genomic sequences of the three genomic segments (L, M and S) of a novel Orthobunyavirus. Characterization of the genomic sequence, including the prediction of open reading frames and the inspection of consensus genomic termini and phylogenetic analysis, further confirmed that the novel virus is indeed a new species, which we named Ness Ziona virus.",Priority Attachment: a Comprehensive Mechanism for Generating Networks.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833611,Scientific reports,2019 03 08,"We claim that networks are created according to the priority attachment mechanism. We introduce a simple model, which uses the priority attachment to generate both synthetic and close to empirical networks. Priority attachment is a mechanism, which generalizes previously proposed mechanisms, such as small world creation or preferential attachment, but we also observe its presence in a range of real-world networks. In this paper, we show that by using priority attachment we can generate networks of very diverse topologies, as well as re-create empirical ones. An additional advantage of the priority attachment mechanism is an easy interpretation of the latent processes of network formation. We substantiate our claims by performing numerical experiments on both synthetic and empirical networks. The two main contributions of the paper are: the development of the priority attachment mechanism, and the design of Priority Rank: a simple network generative model based on the priority attachment mechanism.",Long-term exercise training improves memory in middle-aged men and modulates peripheral levels of BDNF and Cathepsin B.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833610,Scientific reports,2019 03 08,"Aging is accompanied by a decline in memory and other brain functions. Physical exercise may mitigate this decline through the modulation of factors participating in the crosstalk between skeletal muscle and the brain, such as neurotrophins and oxidative stress parameters. We aimed to determine whether long term exercise training (35 ± 15 years) promotes memory maintenance in middle-aged men, and to characterize the changes in neurotrophic factors and lipid oxidation markers in peripheral blood samples in both middle-aged and young men. The neuropsychological analysis showed significant improvements in memory through the Free and Cued Immediate Recall tests, in the middle-aged trained individuals when compared to the sedentary ones. We found a significant decrease in the resting serum BDNF and plasma Cathepsin B (CTSB) levels in the trained groups at both middle and young ages. BDNF and CTSB levels were inversely correlated with weekly hours of exercise. We also found a significant decrease in plasma malondialdehyde, an index of lipid peroxidation, in middle-aged and young trained subjects. The positive impact of long-term exercise training by delaying the onset of physiological memory loss and the associated neurotrophic and redox peripheral modulation, suggests the effectiveness of exercise as preventive strategy against age-related memory loss and neurodegeneration.",A bio-coupling approach using a dextran-binding domain to immobilize an engineered streptavidin to Sephadex for easy preparation of affinity matrix.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833609,Scientific reports,2019 03 08,"An engineered streptavidin, SAVSBPM18 with reversible biotin binding capability, has been successfully applied to purify biotinylated and streptavidin-binding peptide (SBP) tagged proteins. To simplify the preparation for the SAVSBPM18 affinity matrix without chemical conjugation, two bio-coupling approaches were developed based on a 14-kDa dextran-binding domain (DBD) from a Leuconostoc mesenteroides dextransucrase. The first approach offers simplicity for bio-coupling by creating a direct fusion, SAVSBPM18-Linker-DBD. Purification of the fusion from crude extract and its immobilization to Sephadex can be consolidated in one-step. The second approach aims at flexibility. A SnoopCatcher (SC) was fused to DBD to create SC-Linker-DBD. This fusion can covalently capture any recombinant proteins tagged with a SnoopTag (ST) including SAVSBPM18-Linker-ST via the formation of an isopeptide bond at the interface through the SnoopCatcher-SnoopTag interaction. Although monomeric DBD binds to dextran with nanomolar affinity, DBD tetramerized via streptavidin (SAVSBPM18-Linker-ST·SC-Linker-DBD) showed an even tighter binding to Sephadex. The majority of the fluorescently labelled DBD tetramers were retained on the Sephadex surface even after four months. Affinity columns generated using either approach effectively purified both SBP-tagged and biotinylated proteins. These columns are reusable and functional even after a year of frequent use."

Foraging efficiency is likely to be a key source of demographic variation as it determines the amount of energy that can be invested in fitness-related activities. Evidence of age-related changes in the foraging efficiency of adult seabirds is scarce and inconsistent. We investigated the effects of age on the foraging efficiency of breeding Adélie penguins, a relatively short-lived seabird species, in order to gain a broader perspective on the processes driving variation in ageing rates. We found support for a positive effect of age, either linear or levelling off at old ages, on both our proxies for daily catch rate and catch per unit effort. Across all age classes, males were more performant foragers than females. We found no strong evidence for differing ageing patterns between sexes or individual quality levels, and no evidence for senescence. We infer that continuous individual improvement could be responsible for a larger amount of the variation in foraging efficiency with age at our study site, compared with selective disappearance of underperforming phenotypes. The different results reported by other studies highlight the need to conduct longitudinal studies across a range of species in different environments.",Deletion of Limk1 and Limk2 in mice does not alter cochlear development or auditory function.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833597,Scientific reports,2019 03 08,"Inherited hearing loss is associated with gene mutations that result in sensory hair cell (HC) malfunction. HC structure is defined by the cytoskeleton, which is mainly composed of actin filaments and actin-binding partners. LIM motif-containing protein kinases (LIMKs) are the primary regulators of actin dynamics and consist of two members: LIMK1 and LIMK2. Actin arrangement is directly involved in the regulation of cytoskeletal structure and the maturation of synapses in the central nervous system, and LIMKs are involved in structural plasticity by controlling the activation of the actin depolymerization protein cofilin in the olfactory system and in the hippocampus. However, the expression pattern and the role of LIMKs in mouse cochlear development and synapse function also need to be further studied. We show here that the Limk genes are expressed in the mouse cochlea. We examined the morphology and the afferent synapse densities of HCs and measured the auditory function in Limk1 and Limk2 double knockout (DKO) mice. We found that the loss of Limk1 and Limk2 did not appear to affect the overall development of the cochlea, including the number of HCs and the structure of hair bundles. There were no significant differences in auditory thresholds between DKO mice and wild-type littermates. However, the expression of p-cofilin in the DKO mice was significantly decreased. Additionally, no significant differences were found in the number or distribution of ribbon synapses between the DKO and wild-type mice. In summary, our data suggest that the Limk genes play a different role in the development of the cochlea compared to their role in the central nervous system.",Non-conventional Ce:YAG nanostructures via urea complexes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833596,Scientific reports,2019 03 08,"Ce:YAG nanostructures (Ce:YAG = Cerium in Yttrium Aluminium Garnet), easy to control and shape, have been prepared via templating approach using natural and synthetic materials (i.e. paper, cotton wool and glass wool) previously soaked with a gel-like metals precursor and then thermally treated to achieve the wished morphology. The final material, otherwise difficult to process, can be easily moulded, it is lightweight, portable and forms, at the nanoscale, homogeneous layers of interconnected but not agglomerated nanoparticles (15 ± 5 nm). Using the same synthetic route, called Urea-Glass-Route, but in absence of a template, extremely pure Ce:YAG nanoparticle (45 ± 5 nm) can be also prepared, highly crystalline and well-defined in size and shape. Both structural and optical properties of the final materials were investigated, showing high optical quality. The support allows the production of a multifunctional material with mouldable shape and potential lighting application for large structures combining the strength, chemical durability, fire resistance, and translucency of glass fibres.

Conversion of the ketone body acetoacetate (AcAc) to β-hydroxybutyrate (β-HB) by the mitochondrial enzyme β-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (BDH) depends upon NADH availability. The β-HB-to-AcAc ratio is therefore expected to reflect mitochondrial redox. Previous studies reported the potential of hyperpolarized 13C-AcAc to monitor mitochondrial redox in cells, perfused organs and in vivo. However, the ability of hyperpolarized 13C-AcAc to cross the blood brain barrier (BBB) and its potential to monitor brain metabolism remained unknown. Our goal was to assess the value of hyperpolarized [1,3-13C2]AcAc in healthy and tumor-bearing mice in vivo. Following hyperpolarized [1,3-13C2]AcAc injection, production of [1,3-13C2]β-HB was detected in normal and tumor-bearing mice. Significantly higher levels of [1-13C]AcAc and lower [1-13C]β-HB-to-[1-13C]AcAc ratios were observed in tumor-bearing mice. These results were consistent with decreased BDH activity in tumors and associated with increased total cellular NAD+/NADH. Our study confirmed that AcAc crosses the BBB and can be used for monitoring metabolism in the brain. It highlights the potential of AcAc for future clinical translation and its potential utility for monitoring metabolic changes associated with glioma, and other neurological disorders.",Genetic polymorphism and phylogenetic differentiation of the Huaxia Platinum System in three Chinese minority ethnicities.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833593,Scientific reports,2019 03 08,"Short tandem repeats (STRs) with features of high polymorphism and abundant evolution information play a significant role in genetic applications such as human forensics, anthropology and population genetics. The Huaxia Platinum System was specifically exploited to allow coamplification of all markers in the expanded Combined DNA Index System and the Chinese National Database. Herein, in continuation of our previous studies, 493 unrelated individuals were firstly genotyped to investigate the efficacy of this novel system in three minority ethnicities of China (Hui, Tibetan and Uygur). Additionally, genetic relationships among our three investigated populations and other previously published populations were analyzed using pairwise genetic distances, multidimensional scaling (MDS), principal component analysis (PCA), cladogram and STRUCTURE. The combined match probabilities (CMP) for the Hui, Tibetan and Uygur groups were 1.6894 × 10-27, 6.1666 × 10-27 and 5.0655 × 10-27, respectively, and the combined powers of exclusion (CPE) were 0.999999999646627, 0.999999999304935 and 0.999999999433994. Population comparison analysis manifested that the Hui and Tibetan populations had genetic affinities with the Han, Yi and Korean populations, while the Uygur group had a close relationship with the Kazakh population. The aforementioned results suggested that the Huaxia Platinum System is a polymorphic and effective tool that is appropriate for personal identification and population genetics.",Bimodal Incoherent Digital Holography for Both Three-Dimensional Imaging and Quasi-Infinite-Depth-of-Field Imaging.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833592,Scientific reports,2019 03 08,"Although three-dimensional (3D) imaging and extended depth-of-field (DOF) imaging are completely opposite techniques, both provide much more information about 3D scenes and objects than does traditional two-dimensional imaging. Therefore, these imaging techniques strongly influence a wide variety of applications, such as broadcasting, entertainment, metrology, security and biology. In the present work, we derive a generalised theory involving incoherent digital holography to describe both 3D imaging and quasi-infinite-DOF (QIDOF) imaging, which allows us to comprehensively discuss the functions of each imaging technique. On the basis of this theory, we propose and develop a bimodal incoherent digital holography system that allows both 3D imaging and QIDOF imaging. The proposed system allows imaging objects using spatially incoherent light and reconstructing 3D images or QIDOF images solely by changing the phase pattern of a spatial light modulator and without requiring mechanical adjustments or any other modifications to the setup. As a proof-of-principle experiment, we evaluate the DOF and record holograms of a reflective object with the proposed system. The experimental results show that the generalised theory is effective; our demonstration platform provides the function of 3D and QIDOF imaging.",A unique and threatened deep water coral-bivalve biotope new to the Mediterranean Sea offshore the Naples megalopolis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833591,Scientific reports,2019 03 08,"The Gulf of Naples is an example of the most beautiful and biodiverse marine regions of the Mediterranean Sea and of the most impacted areas in terms of industrial activities, large contaminated areas, resource exploitation, infrastructures at sea and maritime transportation. We conducted Remotely Operated Vehicle surveys in the Dohrn Canyon in the Tyrrhenian Sea at approximately 12 NM off Naples metropolitan area, and revealed a hotspot of deep-sea benthic biodiversity of sessile fauna at ca. 400 m depth. The hard bottoms are characterized by a high abundance of charismatic species, such as the habitat forming cold-water corals (CWC) Madrepora oculata, Lophelia pertusa, Desmophyllum dianthus in association with the large size bivalves Acesta excavata and Neopycnodonte zibrowii. This CWC-bivalve co-occurrence represents a novel biotope for the Mediterranean Sea, which coexists with the evidence of severe anthropogenic threats, such as illegal dumping and fishery malpractices that were visually documented during the survey. We recommend the adoption of specific protection measures to preserve these unique deep-sea assemblages showing the uncommon co-existence of such a number of deep-sea species in a single habitat.",Pore-scale characteristics of multiphase flow in heterogeneous porous media using the lattice Boltzmann method.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833590,Scientific reports,2019 03 08,"This study provides a pore-scale investigation of two-phase flow dynamics during primary drainage in a realistic heterogeneous rock sample. Using the lattice Boltzmann (LB) method, a series of three-dimensional (3D) immiscible displacement simulations are conducted and three typical flow patterns are identified and mapped on the capillary number (Ca)-viscosity ratio(M) phase diagram. We then investigate the effect of the viscosity ratio and capillary number on fluid saturation patterns and displacement stability in Tuscaloosa sandstone, which is taken from the Cranfield site. The dependence of the evolution of saturation, location of the displacement front, 3D displacement patterns and length of the center of mass of the invading fluid on the viscosity ratio and capillary number have been delineated. To gain a quantitative insight into the characteristics of the invasion morphology in 3D porous media, the fractal dimension Df of the non-wetting phase displacement patterns during drainage has been computed for various viscosity ratios and capillary numbers. The logarithmic dependence of Df on invading phase saturation appears to be the same for various capillary numbers and viscosity ratios and follows a universal relation.","Identification and expression of candidate chemosensory receptors in the white-spotted flower chafer, Protaetia brevitarsis.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833589,Scientific reports,2019 03 08,"Accurate detection and recognition of chemical signals play extremely important roles for insects in their survival and reproduction. Chemosensory receptors, including odorant receptors (ORs), ionotropic receptors (IRs) and gustatory receptors (GRs), are involved in detection of volatile signals. In the present study, we aimed to identify candidate chemosensory receptors, and RNA-seq technology was employed to sequence the antennal transcriptome of Protaetia brevitarsis (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae: Cetoniinae), a native agricultural and horticultural pest in East-Asia. According to the sequence similarity analysis, we identified 72 PbreORs, 11 PbreGRs and eight PbreIRs. Among PbreORs, PbreOR2, PbreOR33 and PbreOR53 were preliminarily classified into pheromone receptors. Further qRT-PCR analysis indicated that 11 PbreORs were specifically expressed in the antennae of male P. brevitarsis, whereas 23 PbreORs were specifically expressed in the female antennae. Our results laid a solid foundation for further functional elucidations of insect chemoreceptors, which could be used as the potential targets of pest management.",Selection and Validation of Reference Genes for Gene Expression Studies by RT-PCR in Dalbergia odorifera.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833587,Scientific reports,2019 03 08,"Perennial tree Dalbergia odorifera T. Chen could form the precious heartwood used to produce chinese traditional medicine, rosewood furniture and fragrances. However the formation of heartwood is time-consuming and low efficient, leading to the severe destruction of its wild resources. Thus, it is urgent to study the molecular mechanism of heartwood formation in D. odorifera. But till now, there is no report about the reference gene selection in this species. In this study, the expression stability of nine candidate reference genes were evaluated across different tissues and stems treated by wound and chemical stimulators. Four algorithms were applied to obtain the robust genes. The results support HIS2, GAPDH, and CYP to be the most stable reference genes in samples under different wound treatments while DNAj was the least stable. In different tissues, HIS2, UBQ, and RPL were the most stable reference genes while DNAj was the least stable. The selected reference genes were validated through the normalization of the qRT-PCR data of six heartwood related genes in terpene biosynthesis pathway and ethylene signal pathway. The results showed that their expression levels were accurate when they were normalized by the most stable reference gene HIS2, or by the combination of the two or three most stable reference genes. These results demonstrated that these selected reference genes are reliable."

Here, we show that DrICE acts downstream of the Hippo Network to regulate endocytic trafficking of at least four cell polarity, cell junction and apical extracellular matrix proteins involved in tracheal tube size control: Crumbs, Uninflatable, Kune-Kune and Serpentine. We further show that tracheal cells are competent to undergo apoptosis, even though developmentally-regulated DrICE function rarely kills tracheal cells. Our results reveal a developmental role for caspases, a pool of DrICE that co-localizes with Clathrin, and a mechanism by which the Hippo Network controls endocytic trafficking. Given reports of in vitro regulation of endocytosis by mammalian caspases during apoptosis, we propose that caspase-mediated regulation of endocytic trafficking is an evolutionarily conserved function of caspases that can be deployed during morphogenesis.",Pocket similarity identifies selective estrogen receptor modulators as microtubule modulators at the taxane site.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833575,Nature communications,2019 04 23,"Taxanes are a family of natural products with a broad spectrum of anticancer activity. This activity is mediated by interaction with the taxane site of beta-tubulin, leading to microtubule stabilization and cell death. Although widely used in the treatment of breast cancer and other malignancies, existing taxane-based therapies including paclitaxel and the second-generation docetaxel are currently limited by severe adverse effects and dose-limiting toxicity. To discover taxane site modulators, we employ a computational binding site similarity screen of > 14,000 drug-like pockets from PDB, revealing an unexpected similarity between the estrogen receptor and the beta-tubulin taxane binding pocket. Evaluation of nine selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) via cellular and biochemical assays confirms taxane site interaction, microtubule stabilization, and cell proliferation inhibition. Our study demonstrates that SERMs can modulate microtubule assembly and raises the possibility of an estrogen receptor-independent mechanism for inhibiting cell proliferation.",ACVR1 R206H cooperates with H3.1K27M in promoting diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma pathogenesis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833574,Nature communications,2019 05 01,"Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) is an incurable pediatric brain tumor, with approximately 25% of DIPGs harboring activating ACVR1 mutations that commonly co-associate with H3.1K27M mutations. Here we show that in vitro expression of ACVR1 R206H with and without H3.1K27M upregulates mesenchymal markers and activates Stat3 signaling. In vivo expression of ACVR1 R206H or G328V with H3.1K27M and p53 deletion induces glioma-like lesions but is not sufficient for full gliomagenesis. However, in combination with PDGFA signaling, ACVR1 R206H and H3.1K27M significantly decrease survival and increase tumor incidence. Treatment of ACVR1 R206H mutant DIPGs with exogenous Noggin or the ACVR1 inhibitor LDN212854 significantly prolongs survival, with human ACVR1 mutant DIPG cell lines also being sensitive to LDN212854 treatment. Together, our results demonstrate that ACVR1 R206H and H3.1K27M promote tumor initiation, accelerate gliomagenesis, promote a mesenchymal profile partly due to Stat3 activation, and identify LDN212854 as a promising compound to treat DIPG.",Probing hydrogen bond strength in liquid water by resonant inelastic X-ray scattering.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833573,Nature communications,2019 03 26,"Local probes of the electronic ground state are essential for understanding hydrogen bonding in aqueous environments. When tuned to the dissociative core-excited state at the O1s pre-edge of water, resonant inelastic X-ray scattering back to the electronic ground state exhibits a long vibrational progression due to ultrafast nuclear dynamics. We show how the coherent evolution of the OH bonds around the core-excited oxygen provides access to high vibrational levels in liquid water. The OH bonds stretch into the long-range part of the potential energy curve, which makes the X-ray probe more sensitive than infra-red spectroscopy to the local environment. We exploit this property to effectively probe hydrogen bond strength via the distribution of intramolecular OH potentials derived from measurements. In contrast, the dynamical splitting in the spectral feature of the lowest valence-excited state arises from the short-range part of the OH potential curve and is rather insensitive to hydrogen bonding.",A genome-wide association analysis identifies 16 novel susceptibility loci for carpal tunnel syndrome.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833571,Nature communications,2019 04 23,"Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is a common and disabling condition of the hand caused by entrapment of the median nerve at the level of the wrist. It is the commonest entrapment neuropathy, with estimates of prevalence ranging between 5-10%. Here, we undertake a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of an entrapment neuropathy, using 12,312 CTS cases and 389,344 controls identified in UK Biobank. We discover 16 susceptibility loci for CTS with p < 5 × 10-8. We identify likely causal genes in the pathogenesis of CTS, including ADAMTS17, ADAMTS10 and EFEMP1, and using RNA sequencing demonstrate expression of these genes in surgically resected tenosynovium from CTS patients. We perform Mendelian randomisation and demonstrate a causal relationship between short stature and higher risk of CTS. We suggest that variants within genes implicated in growth and extracellular matrix architecture contribute to the genetic predisposition to CTS by altering the environment through which the median nerve transits.",Cryo-thermal therapy induces macrophage polarization for durable anti-tumor immunity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833570,Cell death & disease,2019 03 07,"Many cancer therapies are being developed for the induction of durable anti-tumor immunity, especially for malignant tumors. The activation of antigen-presenting cells (APCs), including macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs), can bridge innate and adaptive immune responses against tumors. However, APCs have an immunosuppressive phenotype and reversing it for effective tumor-specific antigen presenting is critical in developing new cancer treatment strategies. We previously developed a novel cryo-thermal therapy to treat malignant melanoma in a mouse model; long-term survival and durable anti-tumor immunity were achieved, but the mechanism involved was unclear. This study revealed cryo-thermal therapy-induced macrophage polarization to the M1 phenotype and modulated the phenotypic and functional maturation of DCs with high expression of co-stimulatory molecules, increased pro-inflammatory cytokine production, and downregulated immuno-inhibitory molecule expression. Further, we observed CD4+ T-cell differentiation into Th1 and cytotoxic T-cell sub-lineages and generation of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, in which M1 macrophage polarization had a direct, important role. The results indicated that cryo-thermal-induced macrophage polarization to the M1 phenotype was essential to mediate durable anti-tumor immunity, leading to long-term survival. Thus, cryo-thermal therapy is a promising strategy to reshape host immunosuppression, trigger persistent memory immunity for tumor eradication, and inhibit metastasis in the long term.",Single-shot on-chip spectral sensors based on photonic crystal slabs.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833569,Nature communications,2019 03 26,"Miniaturized spectrometers have significant potential for portable applications such as consumer electronics, health care, and manufacturing.

Analyzing optical genome maps of 154 individuals from the 26 populations sequenced in the 1000 Genomes Project, we find that phylogenetic population patterns of large SVs are similar to those of single nucleotide variations in 86% of the human genome, while ~2% of the genome has high structural complexity. We are able to characterize SVs in many intractable regions of the genome, including segmental duplications and subtelomeric, pericentromeric, and acrocentric areas. In addition, we discover ~60 Mb of non-redundant genome content missing in the reference genome sequence assembly.

However inferior results in ether electrolytes suggest that high solubility of Li2Sn (n ≤ 4) trumps the limited redox conversion, leading to dissolution and shuttling. Here, we introduce a small amount of selenium in sulfurized polyacrylonitrile to accelerate the redox conversion, delivering excellent performance in both carbonate and ether electrolytes, including high reversible capacity (1300 mA h g-1 at 0.2 A g-1), 84% active material utilization and high rate (capacity up to 900 mA h g-1 at 10 A g-1). These cathodes can undergo 800 cycles with nearly 100% Coulombic efficiency and ultralow 0.029% capacity decay per cycle.

However, the dependency of most methods on reference genomes, which are currently unavailable for a substantial fraction of microbial species, introduces estimation biases. We present an updated and functionally extended tool based on universal (i.e., reference-independent), phylogenetic marker gene (MG)-based operational taxonomic units (mOTUs) enabling the profiling of >7700 microbial species. As more than 30% of them could not previously be quantified at this taxonomic resolution, relative abundance estimates based on mOTUs are more accurate compared to other methods. As a new feature, we show that mOTUs, which are based on essential housekeeping genes, are demonstrably well-suited for quantification of basal transcriptional activity of community members. Furthermore, single nucleotide variation profiles estimated using mOTUs reflect those from whole genomes, which allows for comparing microbial strain populations (e.g., across different human body sites).",Inhibition of lymphatic proliferation by the selective VEGFR-3 inhibitor SAR131675 ameliorates diabetic nephropathy in db/db mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833548,Cell death & disease,2019 03 07,"Recent studies have demonstrated that chronic inflammation-induced lymphangiogenesis plays a crucial role in the progression of various renal diseases, including diabetic nephropathy. SAR131675 is a selective vascular endothelial cell growth factor receptor-3 (VEGFR-3)-tyrosine kinase inhibitor that acts as a ligand for VEGF-C and VEGF-D to inhibit lymphangiogenesis. In this study, we evaluated the effect of SAR131675 on renal lymphangiogenesis in a mouse model of type 2 diabetes. Male C57BLKS/J db/m and db/db mice were fed either a regular chow diet or a diet containing SAR131675 for 12 weeks from 8 weeks of age. In addition, we studied palmitate-induced lymphangiogenesis in human kidney-2 (HK2) cells and RAW264.7 monocytes/macrophages, which play a major role in lymphangiogenesis in the kidneys. SAR131475 ameliorated dyslipidemia, albuminuria, and lipid accumulation in the kidneys of db/db mice, with no significant changes in glucose and creatinine levels and body weight. Diabetes-induced systemic inflammation as evidenced by increased systemic monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and tumor necrosis factor-α level was decreased by SAR131475. SAR131475 ameliorated the accumulation of triglycerides and free fatty acids and reduced inflammation in relation to decreased chemokine expression and pro-inflammatory M1 macrophage infiltration in the kidneys. Downregulation of VEGF-C and VEGFR-3 by SAR131475 inhibited lymphatic growth as demonstrated by decreased expression of LYVE-1 and podoplanin that was further accompanied by reduced tubulointerstitial fibrosis, and inflammation in relation to improvement in oxidative stress and apoptosis. Treatment with SAR131475 improved palmitate-induced increase in the expression of VEGF-C, VEGFR-3, and LYVE-1, along with improvement in cytosolic and mitochondrial oxidative stress in RAW264.7 and HK2 cells. Moreover, the enhanced expression of M1 phenotypes in RAW264.7 cells under palmitate stress was reduced by SAR131475 treatment. The results suggest that modulation of lymphatic proliferation in the kidneys is a new treatment approach for type 2 diabetic nephropathy and that SAR131675 is a promising therapy to ameliorate renal damage by reducing lipotoxicity-induced lymphangiogenesis.",Neuronal AMP-activated protein kinase hyper-activation induces synaptic loss by an autophagy-mediated process.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833547,Cell death & disease,2019 03 07,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by synaptic loss that leads to the development of cognitive deficits. Synapses are neuronal structures that play a crucial role in memory formation and are known to consume most of the energy used in the brain. Interestingly, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), the main intracellular energy sensor, is hyper-activated in degenerating neurons in several neurodegenerative diseases, including AD. In this context, we asked whether AMPK hyper-activation could influence synapses' integrity and function. AMPK hyper-activation in differentiated primary neurons led to a time-dependent decrease in pre- and post-synaptic markers, which was accompanied by a reduction in synapses number and a loss of neuronal networks functionality. The loss of post-synaptic proteins was mediated by an AMPK-regulated autophagy-dependent pathway. Finally, this process was also observed in vivo, where AMPK hyper-activation primed synaptic loss. Overall, our data demonstrate that during energetic stress condition, AMPK might play a fundamental role in the maintenance of synaptic integrity, at least in part through the regulation of autophagy. Thus, AMPK might represent a potential link between energetic failure and synaptic integrity in neurodegenerative conditions such as AD.",Decrease of AIM2 mediated by luteolin contributes to non-small cell lung cancer treatment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833546,Cell death & disease,2019 03 12,"Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is one of the most common malignancies in the world. Although extensive studies showed that luteolin exhibited antitumor effects against NSCLC, the mechanism has not been fully established. In the present study, we found that luteolin significantly reduced the expression of absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2) at both mRNA and protein levels leading to the suppression of AIM2 inflammasome activation, which induced G2/M phase arrest and inhibited epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in NSCLC. Furthermore, the inhibitory effects of luteolin on NSCLC cells were abolished by the knockdown of AIM2. On the contrary, the antitumor effects of luteolin could be notably reversed by the overexpression of AIM2. In addition, luteolin reduced poly(dA:dT)-induced caspase-1 activation and IL-1β cleavage in NSCLC cells. These findings suggested that AIM2 was essential to luteolin-mediated antitumor effects. The antitumor effects of luteolin, which were closely associated with AIM2, were also confirmed in the A549 and H460 xenograft mouse models. Collectively, our study displayed that the antitumor effects of luteolin on NSCLC were AIM2 dependent and the downregulation of AIM2 might be an effective way for NSCLC treatment.",Circadian control of stress granules by oscillating EIF2α.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833545,Cell death & disease,2019 03 07,"Stress granule formation is important for stress response in normal cells and could lead to chemotherapy resistance in cancer cells. Aberrant stress granule dynamics are also known to disrupt proteostasis, affect RNA metabolism, and contribute to neuronal cell death. Meanwhile, circadian abnormality is an aging-related risk factor for cancer and neurodegeneration. Whether stress granule dynamics are circadian regulated is entirely unknown. Here we show that the formation of stress granules varied by zeitgeber time in mouse liver. Moreover, altering circadian regulation by silencing the core circadian gene Bmal1 in a cell line expressing an endogenous GFP-tagged G3BP1 significantly increased stress granule dynamics, while the overexpression of Bmal1 decreased them. Surprisingly, increased stress granule dynamics and formation by transient decrease of BMAL1 coincided with increased resistance to stress-induced cell death. The circadian regulation of stress granules was mediated by oscillating eIF2α expression. At zeitgeber time when BMAL1 and eIF2α were at nadir, reduction of unphosphorylated eIF2α could significantly alter the ratio of phosphorylated/total eIF2α and quickly lead to increased formation of stress granules. Therefore, diurnal oscillating eIF2α connects the circadian cue to a cellular stress response mechanism that is vital for both neurodegeneration and cancer.",NPTX2 promotes colorectal cancer growth and liver metastasis by the activation of the canonical Wnt/β-catenin pathway via FZD6.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833544,Cell death & disease,2019 03 07,"Accumulating evidence from clinical and epidemiological studies has highlighted the close correlation between the individual risk of cancer and nervous system diseases. The expression of neuronal pentraxin 2 (NPTX2) is absent in Alzheimer's disease, anxiety, and depression. Herein, we found that NPTX2 mRNA and protein expression was significantly upregulated in colorectal carcinoma (CRC). NPTX2 expression level gradually increased with CRC progression and was closely associated with poor prognosis. In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated that NPTX2 promoted CRC proliferation and metastasis through the activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. As NPTX2 receptors are absent on CRC cells, NPTX2 was shown to physically interact with frizzled class receptor 6 (FZD6) to promote β-catenin translocation into the cell nucleus, resulting in an increase in the expression of MYC, cyclin D1, snail, and N-cadherin along with a decrease in the expression of E-cadherin. Knockdown of FZD6 expression with a small-interfering RNA almost completely reversed the proliferative effects of NPTX2 on CRC development. In conclusion, NPTX2, a molecule related to nervous system diseases, promotes CRC cell proliferation and metastasis through the activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway via direct interaction with FZD6.",TNFRSF receptor-specific antibody fusion proteins with targeting controlled FcγR-independent agonistic activity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833543,Cell death & disease,2019 03 07,"Antibodies specific for TNFRSF receptors that bind soluble ligands without getting properly activated generally act as strong agonists upon FcγR binding. Systematic analyses revealed that the FcγR dependency of such antibodies to act as potent agonists is largely independent from isotype, FcγR type, and of the epitope recognized. This suggests that the sole cellular attachment, achieved by Fc domain-FcγR interaction, dominantly determines the agonistic activity of antibodies recognizing TNFRSF receptors poorly responsive to soluble ligands. In accordance with this hypothesis, we demonstrated that antibody fusion proteins harboring domains allowing FcγR-independent cell surface anchoring also act as strong agonist provided they have access to their target. This finding defines a general possibility to generate anti-TNFRSF receptor antibodies with FcγR-independent agonism. Moreover, anti-TNFRSF receptor antibody fusion proteins with an anchoring domain promise superior applicability to conventional systemically active agonists when an anchoring target with localized disease associated expression can be addressed.",Cellular energy stress induces AMPK-mediated regulation of glioblastoma cell proliferation by PIKE-A phosphorylation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833542,Cell death & disease,2019 03 08,"Phosphoinositide 3-kinase enhancer-activating Akt (PIKE-A), which associates with and potentiates Akt activity, is a pro-oncogenic factor that play vital role in cancer cell survival and growth. However, PIKE-A physiological functions under energy/nutrient deficiency are poorly understood. The AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is an evolutionarily conserved serine/threonine kinase that is a principal regulator of energy homeostasis and has a critical role in metabolic disorders and cancers. In this present study, we show that cellular energy stress induces PIKE-A phosphorylation mediated by AMPK activation, thereby preventing its carcinogenic action. Moreover, AMPK directly phosphorylates PIKE-A Ser-351 and Ser-377, which become accessible for the interaction with 14-3-3β, and in turn stimulates nuclear translocation of PIKE-A. Nuclear PIKE-A associates with CDK4 and then disrupts CDK4-cyclinD1 complex and inhibits the Rb pathway, resulting in cancer cell cycle arrest. Our data uncover a molecular mechanism and functional significance of PIKE-A phosphorylation response to cellular energy status mediated by AMPK."

The temporal dynamics of sustained and transient neural activity supporting the selection and holding of memory content is not known. To address this problem, we recorded magnetoencephalography in healthy participants performing a retro-cue working memory task in which the selection rule and the memory content varied independently. Multivariate decoding and source analyses showed that selecting the memory content relies on prefrontal and parieto-occipital persistent oscillatory neural activity. By contrast, the memory content was reactivated in a distributed occipitotemporal posterior network, preceding the working memory decision and in a different format than during the visual encoding.

Recent advances in multivariate analysis of brain activity allowed the characterization of brain regions that stores the memory. We applied multivariate analysis to time-resolved brain signals to characterize the spatiotemporal signature underlying these subprocesses.

Yet, it is unknown how this information is used for even simple perceptual choices such as discriminating orientation. To determine the computation underlying this perceptual choice, we took advantage of the robust visual adaptation in mouse primary visual cortex (V1). We first designed a stimulus paradigm in which we could vary the degree of neuronal adaptation measured in V1 during an orientation discrimination task. We then determined how adaptation affects task performance for mice of both sexes and tested which neuronal computations are most consistent with the behavioral results given the adapted population responses in V1. Despite increasing the reliability of the population representation of orientation among neurons, and improving the ability of a variety of optimal decoders to discriminate target from distractor orientations, adaptation increases animals' behavioral thresholds. Decoding the animals' choice from neuronal activity revealed that this unexpected effect on behavior could be explained by an overreliance of the perceptual choice circuit on target preferring neurons and a failure to appropriately discount the activity of neurons that prefer the distractor. Consistent with this all-positive computation, we find that animals' task performance is susceptible to subtle perturbations of distractor orientation and optogenetic suppression of neuronal activity in V1. This suggests that to solve this task the circuit has adopted a suboptimal and task-specific computation that discards important task-related information.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT A major goal in systems neuroscience is to understand how sensory signals are used to guide behavior. This requires determining what information in sensory cortical areas is used, and how it is combined, by downstream perceptual choice circuits. Here we demonstrate that when performing a go/no-go orientation discrimination task, mice suboptimally integrate signals from orientation tuned visual cortical neurons. While they appropriately positively weight target-preferring neurons, they fail to negatively weight distractor-preferring neurons. We propose that this all-positive computation may be adopted because of its simple learning rules and faster processing, and may be a common approach to perceptual decision-making when task conditions allow.",Intracellular Zn2+ Signaling Facilitates Mossy Fiber Input-Induced Heterosynaptic Potentiation of Direct Cortical Inputs in Hippocampal CA3 Pyramidal Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833508,The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,2019 05 19,"Repetitive action potentials (APs) in hippocampal CA3 pyramidal cells (CA3-PCs) backpropagate to distal apical dendrites, and induce calcium and protein tyrosine kinase (PTK)-dependent downregulation of Kv1.2, resulting in long-term potentiation of direct cortical inputs and intrinsic excitability (LTP-IE). When APs were elicited by direct somatic stimulation of CA3-PCs from rodents of either sex, only a narrow window of distal dendritic [Ca2+] allowed LTP-IE because of Ca2+-dependent coactivation of PTK and protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP), which renders non-mossy fiber (MF) inputs incompetent in LTP-IE induction. High-frequency MF inputs, however, could induce LTP-IE at high dendritic [Ca2+] of the window. We show that MF input-induced Zn2+ signaling inhibits postsynaptic PTP, and thus enables MF inputs to induce LTP-IE at a wide range of [Ca2+]i values. Extracellular chelation of Zn2+ or genetic deletion of vesicular zinc transporter abrogated the privilege of MF inputs for LTP-IE induction. Moreover, the incompetence of somatic stimulation was rescued by the inhibition of PTP or a supplement of extracellular zinc, indicating that MF input-induced increase in dendritic [Zn2+] facilitates the induction of LTP-IE by inhibiting PTP. Consistently, high-frequency MF stimulation induced immediate and delayed elevations of [Zn2+] at proximal and distal dendrites, respectively. These results indicate that MF inputs are uniquely linked to the regulation of direct cortical inputs owing to synaptic Zn2+ signaling.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Zn2+ has been mostly implicated in pathological processes, and the physiological roles of synaptically released Zn2+ in intracellular signaling are little known. We show here that Zn2+ released from hippocampal mossy fiber (MF) terminals enters postsynaptic CA3 pyramidal cells, and plays a facilitating role in MF input-induced heterosynaptic potentiation of perforant path (PP) synaptic inputs through long-term potentiation of intrinsic excitability (LTP-IE). We show that the window of cytosolic [Ca2+] that induces LTP-IE is normally very narrow because of the Ca2+-dependent coactivation of antagonistic signaling pairs, whereby non-MF inputs become ineffective in inducing excitability change. The MF-induced Zn2+ signaling, however, biases toward facilitating the induction of LTP-IE. The present study elucidates why MF inputs are more privileged for the regulation of PP synapses.",Systems Analysis of the 22q11.2 Microdeletion Syndrome Converges on a Mitochondrial Interactome Necessary for Synapse Function and Behavior.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833507,The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,2019 05 18,"Neurodevelopmental disorders offer insight into synaptic mechanisms.

Here, we investigate their role using a cochlear viral cDNA transfer approach in vivo, where IHCs of mouse lacking otoferlin (Otof-/- mice of both sexes) were virally transduced with cDNAs of various mini-otoferlins. Using patch-clamp recordings and membrane capacitance measurements, we show that the viral transfer of mini-otoferlin containing C2-ACEF, C2-EF, or C2-DEF partially restores the fast exocytotic component in Otof-/- mouse IHCs. The restoration was much less efficient with C2-ACDF, underlining the importance of the C2-EF domain. None of the mini-otoferlins tested restored the sustained component of vesicle release, explaining the absence of hearing recovery. The restoration of the fast exocytotic component in the transduced Otof-/- IHCs was also associated with a recovery of Ca2+ currents with normal amplitude and fast time inactivation, confirming that the C-terminal C2 domains of otoferlin are essential for normal gating of Cav1.3 channels. Finally, the reintroduction of the mini-otoferlins C2-EF, C2-DEF, or C2-ACEF allowed us to uncover and characterize for the first time a dynamin-dependent ultrafast endocytosis in IHCs.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Otoferlin, a large six-C2-domain protein, is essential for synaptic vesicle exocytosis at auditory hair cell ribbon synapses. Here, we show that the viral expression of truncated forms of otoferlin (C2-EF, C2-DEF, and C2-ACEF) can partially rescue the fast and transient release component of exocytosis in mouse hair cells lacking otoferlin, yet cannot sustain exocytosis after long repeated stimulation. Remarkably, these hair cells also display a dynamin-dependent ultrafast endocytosis. Overall, our study uncovers the pleiotropic role of otoferlin in the hair cell synaptic vesicle cycle, notably in triggering both ultrafast exocytosis and endocytosis and recruiting synaptic vesicles to the active zone.",In Vivo Submillisecond Two-Photon Optogenetics with Temporally Focused Patterned Light.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833505,The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,2019 05 18,"To better examine circuit mechanisms underlying perception and behavior, researchers need tools to enable temporally precise control of action-potential generation of individual cells from neuronal ensembles. Here we demonstrate that such precision can be achieved with two-photon (2P) temporally focused computer-generated holography to control neuronal excitability at the supragranular layers of anesthetized and awake visual cortex in both male and female mice. Using 2P-guided whole-cell or cell-attached recordings in positive neurons expressing any of the three opsins ReaChR, CoChR, or ChrimsonR, we investigated the dependence of spiking activity on the opsin's channel kinetics. We found that in all cases the use of brief illumination (≤10 ms) induces spikes of millisecond temporal resolution and submillisecond precision, which were preserved upon repetitive illuminations up to tens of hertz. To reach high temporal precision, we used a large illumination spot covering the entire cell body and an amplified laser at high peak power and low excitation intensity (on average ≤0.2 mW/μm2), thus minimizing the risk for nonlinear photodamage effects. Finally, by combining 2P holographic excitation with electrophysiological recordings and calcium imaging using GCaMP6s, we investigated the factors, including illumination shape and intensity, opsin distribution in the target cell, and cell morphology, which affect the spatial selectivity of single-cell and multicell holographic activation. Parallel optical control of neuronal activity with cellular resolution and millisecond temporal precision should make it easier to investigate neuronal connections and find further links between connectivity, microcircuit dynamics, and brain functions.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Recent developments in the field of optogenetics has enabled researchers to probe the neuronal microcircuit with light by optically actuating genetically encoded light-sensitive opsins expressed in the target cells. Here, we applied holographic light shaping and temporal focusing to simultaneously deliver axially confined holographic patterns to opsin-positive cells in the living mouse cortex. Parallel illumination efficiently induced action potentials with high temporal resolution and precision for three opsins of different kinetics. We extended the parallel optogenetic activation at low intensity to multiple neurons and concurrently monitored their calcium dynamics. These results demonstrate fast and temporally precise in vivo control of a neuronal subpopulation, opening new opportunities for revealing circuit mechanisms underlying brain functions.","Animal Models of (or for) Aggression Reward, Addiction, and Relapse: Behavior and Circuits.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833504,The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,2019 06 10,"Inappropriate and pathological aggression plays a leading role in the suffering and death of millions of people, and further places an untenable strain on the caregivers and families of those afflicted. In some cases, such as addictive drugs, aggression can be highly rewarding (appetitive) and continually pursued despite short- and long-term negative consequences. Similarly, recidivism (relapse) rates for repeat violent offenders are as high as relapse rates for drug addicts. Appetitive aggression and relapse to aggression seeking can be modeled in mice studies using conditioned place preference and self-administration procedures followed by a period of abstinence and subsequent tests for relapse to aggression preference and aggression seeking. These procedures allow for the study of the mechanisms that control the appetitive versus the consummatory (attack) phases of aggressive behavior. In this review, we first discuss the behavioral procedures developed to probe appetitive aggression in mouse models, spanning from Pavlovian to operant tasks, and we also describe the recently proposed phenomenon of ""aggression addiction."" Next, we discuss the pharmacological and circuit mechanisms of aggression conditioned place preference and aggression self-administration, seeking, and relapse, highlighting mechanistic congruence and divergence between appetitive and consummatory phases of aggression. We conclude by discussing clinical implications of the studies reviewed.",Effect of methylprednisolone on acute kidney injury in patients undergoing cardiac surgery with a cardiopulmonary bypass pump: a randomized controlled trial.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833491,CMAJ : Canadian Medical Association journal = journal de l'Association medicale canadienne,2019 03 29,Perioperative corticosteroid use may reduce acute kidney injury.

Upon re-oxygenation, the preferential oxidation of accumulated succinate most often impairs mitochondrial function. Few species can survive prolonged periods of hypoxia and anoxia at tropical temperatures and those that do may rely on mitochondria plasticity in response to disruptions to oxygen availability. Two carpet sharks, the epaulette shark (Hemiscyllium ocellatum) and the grey carpet shark (Chiloscyllium punctatum) display different adaptive responses to prolonged anoxia: while H. ocellatum enters energy-conserving metabolic depression, C. punctatum temporarily elevates its haematocrit, prolonging oxygen delivery. High-resolution respirometry was used to investigate mitochondrial function in the cerebellum, a highly metabolically active organ that is oxygen sensitive and vulnerable to injury after anoxia/re-oxygenation (AR). Succinate was titrated into cerebellar preparations in vitro, with or without pre-exposure to AR, then the activity of mitochondrial complexes was examined. As in most vertebrates, C. punctatum mitochondria significantly increased succinate oxidation rates, with impaired complex I function post-AR. In contrast, H. ocellatum mitochondria inhibited succinate oxidation rates and both complex I and II capacities were conserved, resulting in preservation of oxidative phosphorylation capacity post-AR. Divergent mitochondrial plasticity elicited by elevated succinate post-AR parallels the inherently divergent physiological adaptations of these animals to prolonged anoxia, namely the absence (C. punctatum) and presence (H. ocellatum) of metabolic depression. As anoxia tolerance in these species also occurs at temperatures close to that for humans, examining their mitochondrial responses to AR could provide insights for novel interventions in clinical settings.",Regression dilution in energy management patterns.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833460,The Journal of experimental biology,2019 03 28,"Analysis of some experimental biology data involves linear regression and interpretation of the resulting slope value. Usually, the x-axis measurements include noise. Noise in the x-variable can create regression dilution, and many biologists are not aware of the implications: regression dilution results in an underestimation of the true slope value. This is particularly problematic when the slope value is diagnostic. For example, energy management strategies of animals can be determined from the regression slope estimate of mean energy expenditure against resting energy expenditure. Typically, energy expenditure is represented by a proxy such as heart rate, which adds substantive measurement error. With simulations and analysis of empirical data, we explore the possible effect of regression dilution on interpretations of energy management strategies. We conclude that unless the coefficient of determination r2 is very high, there is a good possibility that regression dilution will affect qualitative interpretation. We recommend some ways to contend with regression dilution, including the application of alternative available regression approaches under certain circumstances.",Chewing or not? Intraoral food processing in a salamandrid newt.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833459,The Journal of experimental biology,2019 03 22,"Food processing refers to any form of mechanical breakdown of food prior to swallowing. Variations of this behaviour are found within all major gnathostome groups. Chewing is by far the most commonly used intraoral processing mechanism and involves rhythmic mandibular jaw and hyobranchial (tongue) movements. Chewing occurs in chondrichthyans (sharks and rays), actinopterygians (ray-finned fishes), dipnoi (lungfishes) as well as amniotes and involves similarities in the patterns of muscle activity and movement of the feeding apparatus. It has been suggested that amniote chewing, which involves the interaction of movements of the mandibular jaw and the muscular tongue, has evolved as part of the tetrapod land invasion. However, little is known about food-processing mechanisms in lissamphibians, which might have retained many ancestral tetrapod features. Here, we identified a processing mechanism in the salamandrid newt, Triturus carnifex, which after prey capture displays cyclic head bobbing in concert with rhythmic jaw and tongue movements. We used high-speed fluoroscopy, anatomical reconstructions and analyses of stomach contents to show that newts, although not using their mandibular jaws, deploy a derived processing mechanism where prey items are rasped rhythmically against the dentition on the mouth roof, driven by a loop motion of the tongue. We then compared patterns and coordination of jaw and tongue movements across gnathostomes to conclude that food processing in this newt species shares traits with processing mechanisms in fish as well as amniotes. This discovery casts salamanders as promising models for reconstructing the evolution of intraoral processing mechanisms at the fish-tetrapod split.",Mechanisms of Small Heat Shock Proteins.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833458,Cold Spring Harbor perspectives in biology,2019 06 10,"Small heat shock proteins (sHSPs) are ATP-independent chaperones that delay formation of harmful protein aggregates. sHSPs' role in protein homeostasis has been appreciated for decades, but their mechanisms of action remain poorly understood. This gap in understanding is largely a consequence of sHSP properties that make them recalcitrant to detailed study. Multiple stress-associated conditions including pH acidosis, oxidation, and unusual availability of metal ions, as well as reversible stress-induced phosphorylation can modulate sHSP chaperone activity. Investigations of sHSPs reveal that sHSPs can engage in transient or long-lived interactions with client proteins depending on solution conditions and sHSP or client identity. Recent advances in the field highlight both the diversity of function within the sHSP family and the exquisite sensitivity of individual sHSPs to cellular and experimental conditions.

Thus, de novo protein biogenesis by ribosomes is vitally important to every cellular system. This process is delicate and error-prone and requires, besides cytosolic chaperones, the guidance by a specialized set of molecular chaperones that bind transiently to the translation machinery and the nascent protein to support early folding events and to regulate cotranslational protein transport. These chaperones include the bacterial trigger factor (TF), the archaeal and eukaryotic nascent polypeptide-associated complex (NAC), and the eukaryotic ribosome-associated complex (RAC). This review focuses on the structures, functions, and substrates of these ribosome-associated chaperones and highlights the most recent findings about their potential mechanisms of action.",Protein Solubility Predictions Using the CamSol Method in the Study of Protein Homeostasis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833455,Cold Spring Harbor perspectives in biology,2019 03 05,"One of the major functions of the protein homeostasis system is to maintain proteins in their soluble states, and indeed several human disorders are associated with the aberrant aggregation of proteins. An active involvement of the protein homeostasis system is necessary to avoid aggregation because proteins are expressed at levels close to their solubility limits, hence being poorly soluble. The mechanisms by which the protein homeostasis system acts to control protein aggregation are, however, still not known in much detail. To facilitate systematic investigations of these mechanisms, we describe here the CamSol method of predicting protein solubility, and illustrate its initial applications. We anticipate that with the advent of powerful proteomics and transcriptomic methods, in combination with the use of the CamSol method and related approaches to predict the solubility and other biophysical properties of proteins, it will become possible to increase our understanding of the principles of protein homeostasis related to the maintenance of the proteome in its soluble form.",Calcium Sensors in Neuronal Function and Dysfunction.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833454,Cold Spring Harbor perspectives in biology,2019 05 02,"Calcium signaling in neurons as in other cell types can lead to varied changes in cellular function. Neuronal Ca2+ signaling processes have also become adapted to modulate the function of specific pathways over a wide variety of time domains and these can have effects on, for example, axon outgrowth, neuronal survival, and changes in synaptic strength. Ca2+ also plays a key role in synapses as the trigger for fast neurotransmitter release. Given its physiological importance, abnormalities in neuronal Ca2+ signaling potentially underlie many different neurological and neurodegenerative diseases. The mechanisms by which changes in intracellular Ca2+ concentration in neurons can bring about diverse responses is underpinned by the roles of ubiquitous or specialized neuronal Ca2+ sensors. It has been established that synaptotagmins have key functions in neurotransmitter release, and, in addition to calmodulin, other families of EF-hand-containing neuronal Ca2+ sensors, including the neuronal calcium sensor (NCS) and the calcium-binding protein (CaBP) families, play important physiological roles in neuronal Ca2+ signaling. It has become increasingly apparent that these various Ca2+ sensors may also be crucial for aspects of neuronal dysfunction and disease either indirectly or directly as a direct consequence of genetic variation or mutations. An understanding of the molecular basis for the regulation of the targets of the Ca2+ sensors and the physiological roles of each protein in identified neurons may contribute to future approaches to the development of treatments for a variety of human neuronal disorders.",Recognition and Degradation of Mislocalized Proteins in Health and Disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833453,Cold Spring Harbor perspectives in biology,2019 03 29,"A defining feature of eukaryotic cells is the segregation of complex biochemical processes among different intracellular compartments.

This recognition is imperfect, resulting in polypeptides at incorrect cellular locations. Cells have evolved mechanisms to selectively recognize mislocalized proteins and triage them for degradation or rescue. These spatial quality control pathways maintain cellular protein homeostasis, become especially important during organelle stress, and might contribute to disease when they are impaired or overwhelmed.",The Proteasome and Its Network: Engineering for Adaptability.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833452,Cold Spring Harbor perspectives in biology,2019 03 05,"The proteasome, the most complex protease known, degrades proteins that have been conjugated to ubiquitin. It faces the unique challenge of acting enzymatically on hundreds and perhaps thousands of structurally diverse substrates, mechanically unfolding them from their native state and translocating them vectorially from one specialized compartment of the enzyme to another. Moreover, substrates are modified by ubiquitin in myriad configurations of chains. The many unusual design features of the proteasome may have evolved in part to endow this enzyme with a robust ability to process substrates regardless of their identity. The proteasome plays a major role in preserving protein homeostasis in the cell, which requires adaptation to a wide variety of stress conditions. Modulation of proteasome function is achieved through a large network of proteins that interact with it dynamically, modify it enzymatically, or fine-tune its levels. The resulting adaptability of the proteasome, which is unique among proteases, enables cells to control the output of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway on a global scale.",Combined small molecule and loss-of-function screen uncovers estrogen receptor alpha and CAD as host factors for HDV infection and antiviral targets.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833451,Gut,2019 03 05,Hepatitis D virus (HDV) is a circular RNA virus coinfecting hepatocytes with hepatitis B virus.

However, the independent contribution of the investigational new drug pretomanid to the efficacy of BPaMZ has not been examined, and its contribution to BPaL has been examined only over the first 2 months of treatment. In the present study, the addition of pretomanid to BL increased bactericidal activity, prevented emergence of bedaquiline resistance, and shortened the duration needed to prevent relapse with drug-susceptible isolates by at least 2 months in BALB/c mice. Addition of pretomanid to bedaquiline, moxifloxacin, and pyrazinamide (BMZ) resulted in a 1-log10 greater CFU reduction after 1 month of treatment and/or reduced the number of mice relapsing in each of 2 experiments in BALB/c mice and in immunocompromised nude mice. Bedaquiline-resistant isolates were found at relapse in only one BMZ-treated nude mouse. Treatment of infection with a pyrazinamide-resistant mutant in BALB/c mice with BPaMZ prevented selection of bedaquiline-resistant mutants and reduced the proportion of mice relapsing compared to that for BMZ treatment alone. Among severely ill C3HeB/FeJ mice with caseous pneumonia and cavitation, BPaMZ increased median survival (≥60 versus 21 days) and reduced median lung CFU by 2.4 log10 at 1 month compared to the level for BMZ. In conclusion, in 3 different mouse models, pretomanid contributed significantly to the efficacy of the BPaMZ and BPaL regimens, including restricting the selection of bedaquiline-resistant mutants.","Pep5, a Fragment of Cyclin D2, Shows Antiparasitic Effects in Different Stages of the Trypanosoma cruzi Life Cycle and Blocks Parasite Infectivity.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833431,Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,2019 06 10,"Pep5 (WELVVLGKL) is a fragment of cyclin D2 that exhibits a 2-fold increase in the S phase of the HeLa cell cycle. When covalently bound to a cell-penetrating peptide (Pep5-cpp), the nonapeptide induces cell death in several tumor cells, including breast cancer and melanoma cells. Additionally, Pep5-cpp reduces the in vivo tumor volume of rat glioblastoma. Chagas disease, which is caused by the flagellated parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, is a neglected disease that occurs mainly in the Americas, where it is considered an important public health issue. Given that there are only two options for treating the disease, it is exceptionally crucial to search for new molecules with potential pharmacological action against the parasites. In this study, we demonstrate that Pep5-cpp induces cell death in epimastigote, trypomastigote, and amastigote forms of T. cruzi The Pep5-cpp peptide was also able to decrease the percentage of infected cells without causing any detectable toxic effects in mammalian host cells. The infective, i.e., trypomastigote form of T. cruzi pretreated with Pep5-cpp was unable to infect LLC-MK2 monkey kidney cells. Also, Pep5-binding proteins were identified by mass spectrometry, including calmodulin-ubiquitin-associated protein, which is related to the virulence and parasitemia of T. cruzi Taken together, these data suggest that Pep5 can be used as a novel alternative for the treatment of Chagas disease.","Assessment of the Potential for Inducing Resistance in Multidrug-Resistant Organisms from Exposure to Minocycline, Rifampin, and Chlorhexidine Used To Treat Intravascular Devices.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833430,Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,2019 06 10,"To assess the potential for the induction of antimicrobial resistance following repeated subinhibitory exposures to the combination minocycline (MIN), rifampin (RIF), and chlorhexidine (CHX), a total of 29 clinical microbial pathogenic isolates were repeatedly exposed to subinhibitory concentrations of MIN, RIF, and CHX for 20 passages. MICs of the MIN, RIF, and CHX combination were assessed at each passage to evaluate the potential for resistance to have been induced. The combination of MIN, RIF, and CHX showed significant antimicrobial efficacy and synergy against organisms resistant to all 3 individual components (MIC of ≥16 μg/ml for MIN or MIC of ≥4 μg/ml for RIF or CHX). Among the organisms originally resistant to 2 or more individual components and the organisms originally susceptible to 2 or more individual components, there was no evidence that organisms became resistant following 20 repeated subinhibitory exposure cycles to the triple combination. The risk of resistance developing to the triple combination is extremely low because microbes are inhibited or killed before resistance can simultaneously emerge to all three agents. Surveillance studies monitoring the development of resistance should be conducted in a clinical setting.",Revising Pediatric Vancomycin Dosing Accounting for Nephrotoxicity in a Pharmacokinetic-Pharmacodynamic Model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833429,Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,2019 06 10,"This study aimed to suggest an initial pediatric vancomycin dose regimen through population pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modeling. A population pharmacokinetic approach was used to analyze vancomycin concentration-time data from a large pediatric cohort. Pharmacokinetic target attainment for patients with bloodstream isolates was compared with clinical outcome using logistic regression and classification and regression trees. Change in serum creatinine during treatment was used as an indicator of acute nephrotoxicity. Probability of acute kidney injury (50% increase from baseline) or kidney failure (75% increase from baseline) was evaluated using logistic regression. An initial dosing regimen was derived, personalized by age, weight, and serum creatinine, using stochastic simulations. Data from 785 hospitalized pediatric patients (1 day to 21 years of age) with suspected Gram-positive infections were collected. Estimated (relative standard error) typical clearance, volume of distribution 1, intercompartmental clearance, and volume of distribution 2 were (standardized to 70 kg) 4.84 (2.38) liters/h, 39.9 (8.15) liters, 3.85 (17.3) liters/h, and 37.8 (10.2) liters, respectively. While cumulative vancomycin exposure correlated positively with the development of nephrotoxicity (713 patients), no clear relationship between vancomycin area under the plasma concentration-time curve and efficacy was found (102 patients). Predicted probability of acute kidney injury and kidney failure with the optimized dosing regimen at day 5 was 10 to 15% and 5 to 10%, increasing by approximately 50% on day 7 and roughly 100% on day 10 across all age groups. This study presents the first data-driven pediatric dose selection to date accounting for nephrotoxicity, and it indicates that cumulative vancomycin exposure best describes risk of acute kidney injury and acute kidney failure.",Generating Robust and Informative Nonclinical In Vitro and In Vivo Bacterial Infection Model Efficacy Data To Support Translation to Humans.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833428,Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,2019 06 10,"In June 2017, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, part of the National Institutes of Health, organized a workshop entitled ""Pharmacokinetics-Pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) for Development of Therapeutics against Bacterial Pathogens.""

We previously identified 11 gestationally elevated maternal circulating miRNAs (HEamiRNAs) that predicted infant growth deficits following PAE. Here, we investigated whether these HEamiRNAs contribute to the pathology of PAE, by inhibiting trophoblast epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a pathway critical for placental development. We now report for the first time that PAE inhibits expression of placental pro-EMT pathway members in both rodents and primates, and that HEamiRNAs collectively, but not individually, mediate placental EMT inhibition. HEamiRNAs collectively, but not individually, also inhibited cell proliferation and the EMT pathway in cultured trophoblasts, while inducing cell stress, and following trophoblast syncytialization, aberrant endocrine maturation. Moreover, a single intravascular administration of the pooled murine-expressed HEamiRNAs, to pregnant mice, decreased placental and fetal growth and inhibited the expression of pro-EMT transcripts in the placenta. Our data suggest that HEamiRNAs collectively interfere with placental development, contributing to the pathology of PAE, and perhaps also, to other causes of fetal growth restriction.",A cytosine-rich splice regulatory determinant enforces functional processing of the human α-globin gene transcript.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833414,Blood,2019 06 13,"The establishment of efficient and stable splicing patterns in terminally differentiated cells is critical to maintenance of specific functions throughout the lifespan of an organism. The human α-globin (hα-globin) gene contains 3 exons separated by 2 short introns. Naturally occurring α-thalassemia mutations that trigger aberrant splicing have revealed the presence of cryptic splice sites within the hα-globin gene transcript. How cognate (functional) splice sites are selectively used in lieu of these cryptic sites has remained unexplored. Here we demonstrate that the preferential selection of a cognate splice donor essential to functional splicing of the hα-globin transcript is dependent on the actions of an intronic cytosine (C)-rich splice regulatory determinant and its interacting polyC-binding proteins. Inactivation of this determinant by mutation of the C-rich element or by depletion of polyC-binding proteins triggers a dramatic shift in splice donor activity to an upstream, out-of-frame, cryptic donor. The essential role of the C-rich element in hα-globin gene expression is supported by its coevolution with the cryptic donor site in primate species. These data lead us to conclude that an intronic C-rich determinant enforces functional splicing of the hα-globin transcript, thus acting as an obligate determinant of hα-globin gene expression.",Tumor-educated platelets.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833413,Blood,2019 05 31,"Liquid biopsies have been considered the holy grail in achieving effective cancer management, with blood tests offering a minimally invasive, safe, and sensitive alternative or complementary approach for tissue biopsies.

So far, the main focus has remained on the ground-state properties; however, the theoretical consensus regarding the magnetic excitations is limited. Here, we study the dynamic spin structure factor (DSSF) of the KAFM by means of the density matrix renormalization group. By comparison with the well-defined magnetically ordered state and the chiral spin liquid sitting nearby in the phase diagram, the KAFM with nearest neighbor interactions shows distinct dynamical responses. The DSSF displays important spectral intensity predominantly in the low-frequency region around the [Formula: see text] point in momentum space and shows a broad spectral distribution in the high-frequency region for momenta along the boundary of the extended Brillouin zone. The excitation continuum identified from momentum- and energy-resolved DSSF signals emergent spinons carrying fractional quantum numbers. These results capture the main observations in the inelastic neutron scattering measurements of herbertsmithite and indicate the spin liquid nature of the ground state. By tracking the DSSF across quantum-phase transition between the chiral spin liquid and the magnetically ordered phase, we identify the condensation of two-spinon bound state driving the quantum-phase transition.",Renal control of disease tolerance to malaria.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833408,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2019 05 31,"Malaria, the disease caused by Plasmodium spp. infection, remains a major global cause of morbidity and mortality. Host protection from malaria relies on immune-driven resistance mechanisms that kill Plasmodium However, these mechanisms are not sufficient per se to avoid the development of severe forms of disease. This is accomplished instead via the establishment of disease tolerance to malaria, a defense strategy that does not target Plasmodium directly. Here we demonstrate that the establishment of disease tolerance to malaria relies on a tissue damage-control mechanism that operates specifically in renal proximal tubule epithelial cells (RPTEC). This protective response relies on the induction of heme oxygenase-1 (HMOX1; HO-1) and ferritin H chain (FTH) via a mechanism that involves the transcription-factor nuclear-factor E2-related factor-2 (NRF2). As it accumulates in plasma and urine during the blood stage of Plasmodium infection, labile heme is detoxified in RPTEC by HO-1 and FTH, preventing the development of acute kidney injury, a clinical hallmark of severe malaria.",Chloroplast competition is controlled by lipid biosynthesis in evening primroses.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833407,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2019 05 31,"In most eukaryotes, organellar genomes are transmitted preferentially by the mother, but molecular mechanisms and evolutionary forces underlying this fundamental biological principle are far from understood. It is believed that biparental inheritance promotes competition between the cytoplasmic organelles and allows the spread of so-called selfish cytoplasmic elements. Those can be, for example, fast-replicating or aggressive chloroplasts (plastids) that are incompatible with the hybrid nuclear genome and therefore maladaptive. Here we show that the ability of plastids to compete against each other is a metabolic phenotype determined by extremely rapidly evolving genes in the plastid genome of the evening primrose Oenothera Repeats in the regulatory region of accD (the plastid-encoded subunit of the acetyl-CoA carboxylase, which catalyzes the first and rate-limiting step of lipid biosynthesis), as well as in ycf2 (a giant reading frame of still unknown function), are responsible for the differences in competitive behavior of plastid genotypes. Polymorphisms in these genes influence lipid synthesis and most likely profiles of the plastid envelope membrane. These in turn determine plastid division and/or turnover rates and hence competitiveness. This work uncovers cytoplasmic drive loci controlling the outcome of biparental chloroplast transmission. Here, they define the mode of chloroplast inheritance, as plastid competitiveness can result in uniparental inheritance (through elimination of the ""weak"" plastid) or biparental inheritance (when two similarly ""strong"" plastids are transmitted).",PERIOD-controlled deadenylation of the timeless transcript in the Drosophila circadian clock.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833404,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2019 05 31,"The Drosophila circadian oscillator relies on a negative transcriptional feedback loop, in which the PERIOD (PER) and TIMELESS (TIM) proteins repress the expression of their own gene by inhibiting the activity of the CLOCK (CLK) and CYCLE (CYC) transcription factors. A series of posttranslational modifications contribute to the oscillations of the PER and TIM proteins but few posttranscriptional mechanisms have been described that affect mRNA stability. Here we report that down-regulation of the POP2 deadenylase, a key component of the CCR4-NOT deadenylation complex, alters behavioral rhythms. Down-regulating POP2 specifically increases TIM protein and tim mRNA but not tim pre-mRNA, supporting a posttranscriptional role. Indeed, reduced POP2 levels induce a lengthening of tim mRNA poly(A) tail. Surprisingly, such effects are lost in per

Here, we have created 3D vascularized proximal tubule models composed of adjacent conduits that are lined with confluent epithelium and endothelium, embedded in a permeable ECM, and independently addressed using a closed-loop perfusion system to investigate renal reabsorption. Our 3D kidney tissue allows for coculture of proximal tubule epithelium and vascular endothelium that exhibits active reabsorption via tubular-vascular exchange of solutes akin to native kidney tissue. Using this model, both albumin uptake and glucose reabsorption are quantified as a function of time. Epithelium-endothelium cross-talk is further studied by exposing proximal tubule cells to hyperglycemic conditions and monitoring endothelial cell dysfunction. This diseased state can be rescued by administering a glucose transport inhibitor.

When explicit (self-report) measures are used, attitudes toward and beliefs about the same social group are often related to each other but can also be dissociated. The present work used three approaches (correlational, experimental, and archival) to conduct a systematic investigation of the relationship between implicit (indirectly revealed) intergroup attitudes and beliefs. In study 1 (n = 1,942), we found significant correlations and, in some cases, evidence for redundancy, between Implicit Association Tests (IATs) measuring attitudes toward and beliefs about the same social groups (mean r = 0.31, 95% confidence interval: [0.24; 0.39]). In study 2 (n = 383), manipulating attitudes via evaluative conditioning produced parallel changes in belief IATs, demonstrating that implicit attitudes can causally drive implicit beliefs when information about the specific semantic trait is absent. In study 3, we used word embeddings derived from a large corpus of online text to show that the relative distance of 22 social groups from positive vs. negative words (reflecting generalized attitudes) was highly correlated with their distance from warm vs. cold, and even competent vs. incompetent, words (reflecting specific beliefs). Overall, these studies provide convergent evidence for tight connections between implicit attitudes and beliefs, suggesting that the dissociations observed using explicit measures may arise uniquely from deliberate judgment processes.",Constitutive signaling activity of a receptor-associated protein links fertilization with embryonic patterning in Arabidopsis thaliana.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833400,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2019 05 02,"In flowering plants, the asymmetrical division of the zygote is the first hallmark of apical-basal polarity of the embryo and is controlled by a MAP kinase pathway that includes the MAPKKK YODA (YDA). In Arabidopsis, YDA is activated by the membrane-associated pseudokinase SHORT SUSPENSOR (SSP) through an unusual parent-of-origin effect: SSP transcripts accumulate specifically in sperm cells but are translationally silent. Only after fertilization is SSP protein transiently produced in the zygote, presumably from paternally inherited transcripts. SSP is a recently diverged, Brassicaceae-specific member of the BRASSINOSTEROID SIGNALING KINASE (BSK) family. BSK proteins typically play broadly overlapping roles as receptor-associated signaling partners in various receptor kinase pathways involved in growth and innate immunity. This raises two questions: How did a protein with generic function involved in signal relay acquire the property of a signal-like patterning cue, and how is the early patterning process activated in plants outside the Brassicaceae family, where SSP orthologs are absent? Here, we show that Arabidopsis BSK1 and BSK2, two close paralogs of SSP that are conserved in flowering plants, are involved in several YDA-dependent signaling events, including embryogenesis. However, the contribution of SSP to YDA activation in the early embryo does not overlap with the contributions of BSK1 and BSK2. The loss of an intramolecular regulatory interaction enables SSP to constitutively activate the YDA signaling pathway, and thus initiates apical-basal patterning as soon as SSP protein is translated after fertilization and without the necessity of invoking canonical receptor activation."

A number of municipalities have proposed or initiated policies to stem the bed bug epidemic, but little guidance is available to evaluate them. One contentious policy is disclosure, whereby landlords are obligated to notify potential tenants of current or prior bed bug infestations. Aimed to protect tenants from leasing an infested rental unit, disclosure also creates a kind of quarantine, partially and temporarily removing infested units from the market. Here, we develop a mathematical model for the spread of bed bugs in a generalized rental market, calibrate it to parameters of bed bug dispersion and housing turnover, and use it to evaluate the costs and benefits of disclosure policies to landlords. We find disclosure to be an effective control policy to curb infestation prevalence. Over the short term (within 5 years), disclosure policies result in modest increases in cost to landlords, while over the long term, reductions of infestation prevalence lead, on average, to savings. These results are insensitive to different assumptions regarding the prevalence of infestation, rate of introduction of bed bugs from other municipalities, and the strength of the quarantine effect created by disclosure. Beyond its application to bed bugs, our model offers a framework to evaluate policies to curtail the spread of household pests and is appropriate for systems in which spillover effects result in highly nonlinear cost-benefit relationships.",Time-dependent manufacturing processes lead to a new class of inverse problems.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833385,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2019 05 06,"The control of time-dependent, energy beam manufacturing processes has been achieved in the past through trial-and-error approaches.

Although tremendous progress has been made in characterizing the genetic basis of heterosis using genomic technologies, molecular mechanisms underlying the genetic components are much less understood. Allele-specific expression (ASE), or imbalance between the expression levels of two parental alleles in the hybrid, has been suggested as a mechanism of heterosis. Here, we performed a genome-wide analysis of ASE by comparing the read ratios of the parental alleles in RNA-sequencing data of an elite rice hybrid and its parents using three tissues from plants grown under four conditions. The analysis identified a total of 3,270 genes showing ASE (ASEGs) in various ways, which can be classified into two patterns: consistent ASEGs such that the ASE was biased toward one parental allele in all tissues/conditions, and inconsistent ASEGs such that ASE was found in some but not all tissues/conditions, including direction-shifting ASEGs in which the ASE was biased toward one parental allele in some tissues/conditions while toward the other parental allele in other tissues/conditions. The results suggested that these patterns may have distinct implications in the genetic basis of heterosis: The consistent ASEGs may cause partial to full dominance effects on the traits that they regulate, and direction-shifting ASEGs may cause overdominance. We also showed that ASEGs were significantly enriched in genomic regions that were differentially selected during rice breeding. These ASEGs provide an index of the genes for future pursuit of the genetic and molecular mechanism of heterosis.","Jet stream dynamics, hydroclimate, and fire in California from 1600 CE to present.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833383,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2019 05 28,"Moisture delivery in California is largely regulated by the strength and position of the North Pacific jet stream (NPJ), winter high-altitude winds that influence regional hydroclimate and forest fire during the following warm season. We use climate model simulations and paleoclimate data to reconstruct winter NPJ characteristics back to 1571 CE to identify the influence of NPJ behavior on moisture and forest fire extremes in California before and during the more recent period of fire suppression. Maximum zonal NPJ velocity is lower and northward shifted and has a larger latitudinal spread during presuppression dry and high-fire extremes. Conversely, maximum zonal NPJ is higher and southward shifted, with narrower latitudinal spread during wet and low-fire extremes. These NPJ, precipitation, and fire associations hold across pre-20th-century socioecological fire regimes, including Native American burning, postcontact disruption and native population decline, and intensification of forest use during the later 19th century. Precipitation extremes and NPJ behavior remain linked in the 20th and 21st centuries, but fire extremes become uncoupled due to fire suppression after 1900. Simulated future conditions in California include more wet-season moisture as rain (and less as snow), a longer fire season, and higher temperatures, leading to drier fire-season conditions independent of 21st-century precipitation changes. Assuming continuation of current fire management practices, thermodynamic warming is expected to override the dynamical influence of the NPJ on climate-fire relationships controlling fire extremes in California. Recent widespread fires in California in association with wet extremes may be early evidence of this change.",Almost partition identities.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833382,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2019 05 06,"An almost partition identity is an identity for partition numbers that is true asymptotically [Formula: see text] of the time and fails infinitely often.

Not only does the identity fail infinitely often, but also, the error grows without bound. In addition, we prove several identities involving the number of parts in restricted partitions. We show that the difference in the number of parts in all self-conjugate partitions of n and the number of parts in all partitions of n into distinct odd parts equals the number of partitions of n in which no odd part is repeated, the smallest part is odd, and there is exactly one even part (possibly repeated).

Accordingly, we explored possible vitamin D and calcium effects on posttreatment (observational) adenoma occurrence. In this secondary analysis of the observational follow-up phase of the Vitamin D/Calcium Polyp Prevention Study, participants who completed the treatment phase were invited to be followed for one additional surveillance colonoscopy cycle. We evaluated adenoma occurrence risk at surveillance colonoscopy, with a mean of 55 ± 15 months after treatment follow-up, according to randomized treatment with vitamin D versus no vitamin D, calcium versus no calcium, and calcium plus vitamin D versus calcium alone. Secondary outcomes included advanced and multiple adenomas.

In termite soldier differentiation, the mandible size considerably increases through two moltings (via the presoldier stage) under the control of juvenile hormone (JH). Regulatory genes are predicted to provide patterning information that induces the mandible-specific cell proliferation. To identify factors responsible for the mandibular enlargement, expression analyses of 18 candidate genes were carried out in the termite Hodotermopsis sjostedti Among those, dachshund (dac), which identifies the intermediate domain along the proximodistal appendage axis, showed mandible-specific upregulation prior to the molt into presoldiers, which can explain the pattern of cell proliferation for the mandibular elongation. Knockdown of dac by RNAi reduced the mandibular length and distorted its morphology. Furthermore, the epistatic relationships among Methoprene tolerant, Insulin receptor, Deformed (Dfd) and dac were revealed by combined RNAi and qRT-PCR analyses, suggesting that dac is regulated by Dfd, downstream of the JH and insulin signaling pathways.

We systematically searched Medline, PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and the Cochrane Library databases. Eligible studies assessing the polymorphisms in the TP53 rs1042522 gene and risk of malignant bone tumors were incorporated. The pooled odds ratio (OR) with its 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were used to assess these possible associations. Five studies with a total of 567 cases and 935 controls were finally included the meta-analysis. Meta-analysis of TP53 rs1042522 polymorphism was significantly associated with an increased risk of malignant bone tumors (G versus C: OR = 1.27, 95% CI 1.08-1.50, P=0.005; GG versus GC/CC: OR = 1.55, 95% CI 1.21-2.00, P=0.001).

In the present study we found that plasma BRE-AS1 and miR-145-5p were both down-regulated in PC patients than in healthy controls. Down-regulation of BRE-AS1 and miR-145-5p effectively distinguished early-stage PC patients from healthy controls. A significant and positive correlation between BRE-AS1 and miR-145-5p was only found in PC patients. BRE-AS1 overexpression mediated miR-145-5p up-regulation in PC cells, while miR-145-5p overexpression did not significantly affect BRE-AS1. Overexpression of BRE-AS1 and miR-145-5p led to inhibited proliferation and promoted apoptosis of PC cells. miR-145-5p inhibitor attenuated the effects of BRE-AS1 overexpression on cancer cell behaviors. Therefore, lncRNA BRE-AS1 may regulate cancer cell proliferation and apoptosis in PC by interacting with miR-145-5p.",A new ESX-1 substrate in M. marinum that is required for hemolysis but not host cell lysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833360,Journal of bacteriology,2019 03 05,"The ESX-1 (ESAT-6 system-1) secretion system plays a conserved role in the virulence of diverse mycobacterial pathogens including the human pathogen, M. tuberculosis and M. marinum, an environmental mycobacterial species. The ESX-1 system promotes the secretion of protein virulence factors to the extra-cytoplasmic environment. The secretion of these proteins triggers the host response by lysing the phagosome during macrophage infection. Using proteomic analyses of the M. marinum secretome in the presence and absence of a functional ESX-1 system, we and others have hypothesized that MMAR_2894, a PE family protein, is a potential ESX-1 substrate in M. marinum. We used genetic and quantitative proteomic approaches to determine if MMAR_2894 is secreted by the ESX-1 system, and we defined the requirement of MMAR_2894 in ESX-1 mediated secretion and virulence. We show that MMAR_2894 is secreted by the ESX-1 system in M. marinum, and is itself required for the optimal secretion of the known ESX-1 substrates in M. marinum. Moreover, we found that MMAR_2894 was differentially required for hemolysis and cytolysis of macrophages, two lytic activities ascribed to the M. marinum ESX-1 system.Importance Both Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the cause of human TB, and Mycobacterium marinum, a pathogen of ectotherms, use the ESX-1 secretion system to cause disease. There are many established similarities between the ESX-1 systems in M. tuberculosis and in M. marinum. Yet, the two bacteria infect different hosts, hinting at species specific functions of the ESX-1 system. Our findings demonstrate that MMAR_2894 is a PE protein secreted by the ESX-1 system of M. marinum. We show that MMAR_2894 is required for the optimal secretion of mycobacterial proteins required for disease. Because the MMAR_2894 gene is not conserved in M. tb, our findings demonstrate that MMAR_2894 may contribute to a species specific function of the ESX-1 system in M. marinum, providing new insight into how the M. marinum and M. tb systems differ.",The Lipoprotein NlpE Is a Cpx Sensor That Serves as a Sentinel for Protein Sorting and Folding Defects in the Escherichia coli Envelope.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833359,Journal of bacteriology,2019 05 05,"The envelope of Gram-negative bacteria is a complex compartment that is essential for viability. To ensure survival of the bacterial cells in fluctuating environments, several signal transduction systems, called envelope stress response systems (ESRSs), exist to monitor envelope biogenesis and homeostasis. The Cpx two-component system is an extensively studied ESRS in Escherichia coli that is active during exposure to a vast array of stresses and protects the envelope under those harmful circumstances. Overproduction of NlpE, a two-domain outer membrane lipoprotein of unclear function, has been used in numerous studies as a molecular trigger to turn on the system artificially. However, the mechanism of Cpx activation by NlpE, as well as its physiological relevance, awaited further investigation. In this paper, we provide novel insights into the role played by NlpE in the Cpx system. We found that, among all outer membrane lipoproteins in E. coli, NlpE is sufficient to induce Cpx when lipoprotein trafficking is perturbed. Under such conditions, fitness is increased by the presence of NlpE. Moreover, we show that NlpE, through its N-terminal domain, physically interacts with the Cpx sensor kinase CpxA. Our data suggest that NlpE also serves to activate the Cpx system during oxidative folding defects in the periplasm and that its C-terminal domain is involved in the sensing mechanism. Overall, our data demonstrate that NlpE acts as a sentinel for two important envelope biogenesis processes, namely, lipoprotein sorting and oxidative folding, and they further establish NlpE as a bona fide member of the Cpx two-component system.IMPORTANCE Bacteria rely on a sophisticated envelope to shield them against challenging environmental conditions and therefore need to ensure correct envelope assembly and integrity. A major signaling pathway that performs this role in Gram-negative species is the Cpx system. An outer membrane lipoprotein of unclear function, NlpE, has long been exploited as a research tool to study Cpx in E. coli, since it triggers this system when overproduced or mislocalized; however, the mechanism and physiological relevance of the NlpE-Cpx connection have awaited further investigation. We elucidate a new function for NlpE by showing that it physically interacts with the Cpx sensor CpxA and acts as a sentinel that specifically monitors two essential envelope biogenesis processes, namely, lipoprotein sorting and oxidative folding.",A putative type V pilus contributes to Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron biofilm formation capacity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833358,Journal of bacteriology,2019 03 05,"Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron is a prominent anaerobe member of the healthy human gut microbiota. While the majority of functional studies on B. thetaiotaomicron addressed its impact on the immune system and the utilization of diet polysaccharide, B. thetaiotaomicron biofilm capacity and its contribution to intestinal colonization are still poorly characterized. We tested the natural adhesion of 34 B. thetaiotaomicron isolates and showed that, although biofilm capacity is widespread among B. thetaiotaomicron strains, this phenotype is masked or repressed in the widely used reference strain VPI 5482. Using transposon mutagenesis followed by a biofilm positive selection procedure we identified VPI 5482 mutants with increased biofilm capacity corresponding to an alteration in the C-terminal region of BT3147, encoded by the BT3148-BT3147 locus, which displays homology with mfa-like typeV pili found in many Bacteroidetes We showed that BT3147 is exposed on B. thetaiotaomicron surface and that BT3147-dependent adhesion also requires BT3148, suggesting that BT3148-BT3147 correspond to the anchor and stalk subunits of a new type V pilus involved in B. thetaiotaomicron adhesion. This study therefore introduces B. thetaiotaomicron as a model to study proteinaceous adhesins and biofilm-related phenotypes in this important intestinal symbiont.IMPORTANCE Although the gut anaerobe Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron is a prominent member of the healthy human gut microbiota, little is known on its capacity adhere to surfaces and form biofilms. Here, we identified that alteration of a surface exposed protein corresponding to a type of pili found in many Bacteroidetes increases B. thetaiotaomicron biofilm formation. This study lays the ground for establishing this bacterium as a model organism for in vitro and in vivo study of biofilm-related phenotypes in gut anaerobes.",Decreased Effective Macromolecular Crowding in Escherichia coli Adapted to Hyperosmotic Stress.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833357,Journal of bacteriology,2019 05 05,"Escherichia coli adapts to changing environmental osmolality to survive and maintain growth. It has been shown that the diffusion of green fluorescent protein (GFP) in cells adapted to osmotic upshifts is higher than expected from the increase in biopolymer volume fraction. To better understand the physicochemical state of the cytoplasm in adapted cells, we now follow the macromolecular crowding during adaptation with fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based sensors. We apply an osmotic upshift and find that after an initial increase, the apparent crowding decreases over the course of hours to arrive at a value lower than that before the osmotic upshift. Crowding relates to cell volume until cell division ensues, after which a transition in the biochemical organization occurs. Analysis of single cells by microfluidics shows that changes in cell volume, elongation, and division are most likely not the cause for the transition in organization. We further show that the decrease in apparent crowding upon adaptation is similar to the apparent crowding in energy-depleted cells. Based on our findings in combination with literature data, we suggest that adapted cells have indeed an altered biochemical organization of the cytoplasm, possibly due to different effective particle size distributions and concomitant nanoscale heterogeneity. This could potentially be a general response to accommodate higher biopolymer fractions yet retaining crowding homeostasis, and it could apply to other species or conditions as well.IMPORTANCE Bacteria adapt to ever-changing environmental conditions such as osmotic stress and energy limitation. It is not well understood how biomolecules reorganize themselves inside Escherichia coli under these conditions. An altered biochemical organization would affect macromolecular crowding, which could influence reaction rates and diffusion of macromolecules. In cells adapted to osmotic upshift, protein diffusion is indeed faster than expected on the basis of the biopolymer volume fraction. We now probe the effects of macromolecular crowding in cells adapted to osmotic stress or depleted in metabolic energy with a genetically encoded fluorescence-based probe. We find that the effective macromolecular crowding in adapted and energy-depleted cells is lower than in unstressed cells, indicating major alterations in the biochemical organization of the cytoplasm.",Flagellar mutants have reduced pilus synthesis in Caulobacter crescentus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833355,Journal of bacteriology,2019 03 05,"Surface appendages such as flagella and type IV pili mediate a broad range of bacterial behaviors including motility, attachment, and surface sensing. While many species harbor both flagella and type IV pili, little is known about how or if their synthesis is coupled. Here, we show that deletions of genes encoding different flagellum machinery components result in a reduction of pilus synthesis in Caulobacter crescentus First, we show that different flagellar mutants exhibit different levels of sensitivity to a pilus-dependent phage and that fewer cells within populations of flagellar mutants make pili. Furthermore, we find that single cells within flagellar mutant populations produce less pili per cell. We demonstrate that these gene deletions result in reduced transcription of pilus-associated genes and have a slight, but significant effect on general transcription profiles. Finally, we show that the decrease in pilus production is due to a reduction in the pool of pilin subunits that are polymerized into pilus fibers. These data demonstrate that mutations in flagellar gene components affect not only motility but can also have considerable and unexpected consequences on other aspects of cell biology.IMPORTANCE Most bacterial species synthesize surface-exposed appendages that are important for environmental interactions and survival under diverse conditions. It is often assumed that these appendages act independently of each other and that mutations in either system can be used to assess functionality in specific processes. However, we show that mutations in flagellar genes can impact the production of type IV pili as well as alter general RNA transcriptional profiles when compared to a wildtype strain. These data demonstrate that seemingly simple mutations can broadly affect cell regulatory networks.",Expanding the Clostridioides difficile genetics toolbox.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833354,Journal of bacteriology,2019 03 05,"Clostridioides difficile genetics has rapidly advanced in recent years thanks to the development of tools for allelic replacement and transposon mutagenesis. In this Special Issue, Müh et al extend the genetics toolbox by developing a CRISPRi strategy for gene silencing in C. difficile The authors demonstrate the tunability and robustness of their CRISPRi system, highlight its utility in studying essential gene function, and discuss exciting new possibilities for dissecting C. difficile physiology.",Redefining the sRNA Transcriptome in Streptococcus pneumoniae Serotype 2 Strain D39.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833353,Journal of bacteriology,2019 05 08,"Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) is a major human respiratory pathogen and a leading cause of bacterial pneumonia worldwide. Small regulatory RNAs (sRNAs), which often act by post-transcriptionally regulating gene expression, have been shown to be crucial for the virulence of S. pneumoniae and other bacterial pathogens. Over 170 putative sRNAs have been identified in S. pneumoniae TIGR4 strain (serotype 4) through transcriptomic studies, and a subset of these sRNAs have been further implicated in regulating pneumococcal pathogenesis. However, there is little overlap in the sRNAs identified among these studies, which indicates that the approaches used for sRNA identification were not sufficiently sensitive and robust and that there are likely many more undiscovered sRNAs encoded in the S. pneumoniae genome. Here, we sought to comprehensively identify sRNAs in Avery's virulent S. pneumoniae strain D39 using two independent RNA-seq based approaches. We developed an unbiased method for identifying novel sRNAs from bacterial RNA-seq data and have further tested the specificity of our analysis program towards identifying sRNAs encoded by both strains D39 and TIGR4. Interestingly, the genes for 15% of the putative sRNAs identified in strain TIGR4 including ones previously implicated in virulence are not present in strain D39 genome suggesting that the differences in sRNA repertoires between these two serotypes may contribute to their strain-specific virulence properties. Finally, this study has identified 66 new sRNA candidates in strain D39, 30 out of which have been further validated, raising the total number of sRNAs that have been identified in strain D39 to 112.IMPORTANCE Recent work has shown that sRNAs play crucial roles in S. pneumoniae pathogenesis, as inactivation of nearly one-third of the putative sRNA genes identified in one study led to reduced fitness or virulence in a murine model. Yet, our understanding of sRNA-mediated gene regulation in S. pneumoniae has been hindered by limited knowledge about these regulatory RNAs, including which sRNAs are synthesized by different S. pneumoniae strains. We sought to address this problem by developing a sensitive sRNA detection technique to identify sRNAs in S. pneumoniae D39. A comparison of our dataset reported here to that of other RNA-seq studies for S. pneumoniae strain D39 and TIGR4 has provided new insights into the S. pneumoniae sRNA transcriptome."

A cathepsin C-like proteolytic clipping activity is observed in nuclear parasite extracts. Notably, an ectopically expressed version of clipped histone H3, PfH3p-HA, is targeted to the nucleus and integrates into mononucleosomes. Furthermore, chromatin immunoprecipitation and next-generation sequencing analysis identified PfH3p-HA as being highly enriched in the upstream region of six genes that play a key role in DNA replication and repair: In these genes, PfH3p-HA demarcates a specific 1.5 kb chromatin island adjacent to the open reading frame. Our results indicate that, in P. falciparum, the process of histone clipping may precede chromatin integration hinting at preferential targeting of pre-assembled PfH3p-containing nucleosomes to specific genomic regions. The discovery of a protease-directed mode of chromatin organization in P. falciparum opens up new avenues to develop new anti-malarials.",Characterization of Early Stages of Human Alveolar Infection by the Q Fever Agent Coxiella burnetii.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833339,Infection and immunity,2019 05 05,"Human Q fever is caused by the intracellular bacterial pathogen Coxiella burnetii Q fever presents with acute flu-like and pulmonary symptoms or can progress to chronic, severe endocarditis. After human inhalation, C. burnetii is engulfed by alveolar macrophages and transits through the phagolysosomal maturation pathway, resisting the acidic pH of lysosomes to form a parasitophorous vacuole (PV) in which to replicate. Previous studies showed that C. burnetii replicates efficiently in primary human alveolar macrophages (hAMs) in ex vivo human lung tissue. Although C. burnetii replicates in most cell types in vitro, the pathogen does not grow in non-hAM cells of human lung tissue. In this study, we investigated the interaction between C. burnetii and other pulmonary cell types apart from the lung environment. C. burnetii formed a prototypical PV and replicated efficiently in human pulmonary fibroblasts and in airway, but not alveolar, epithelial cells. Atypical PV expansion in alveolar epithelial cells was attributed in part to defective recruitment of autophagy-related proteins. Further assessment of the C. burnetii growth niche showed that macrophages mounted a robust interleukin 8 (IL-8), neutrophil-attracting response to C. burnetii and ultimately shifted to an M2-polarized phenotype characteristic of anti-inflammatory macrophages. Considering our findings together, this study provides further clarity on the unique C. burnetii-lung dynamic during early stages of human acute Q fever.",Metabolites Involved in Immune Evasion by Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis Include the Polyamine Spermidine.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833338,Infection and immunity,2019 05 05,"Amphibians have been declining around the world for more than four decades. One recognized driver of these declines is the chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, which causes the disease chytridiomycosis. Amphibians have complex and varied immune defenses against B. dendrobatidis, but the fungus also has a number of counterdefenses. Previously, we identified two small molecules produced by the fungus that inhibit frog lymphocyte proliferation, methylthioadenosine (MTA) and kynurenine (KYN). Here, we report on the isolation and identification of the polyamine spermidine (SPD) as another significant immunomodulatory molecule produced by B. dendrobatidis SPD and its precursor, putrescine (PUT), are the major polyamines detected, and SPD is required for growth. The major pathway of biosynthesis is from ornithine through putrescine to spermidine. An alternative pathway from arginine to agmatine to putrescine appears to be absent. SPD is inhibitory at concentrations of ≥10 μM and is found at concentrations between 1 and 10 μM in active fungal supernatants. Although PUT is detected in the fungal supernatants, it is not inhibitory to lymphocytes even at concentrations as high as 100 μM. Two other related polyamines, norspermidine (NSP) and spermine (SPM), also inhibit amphibian lymphocyte proliferation, but a third polyamine, cadaverine (CAD), does not. A suboptimal (noninhibitory) concentration of MTA (10 μM), a by-product of spermidine synthesis, enhances the inhibition of SPD at 1 and 10 μM. We interpret these results to suggest that B. dendrobatidis produces an ""armamentarium"" of small molecules that, alone or in concert, may help it to evade clearance by the amphibian immune system.",Analysis of Invasive Nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae Isolates Reveals Selection for the Expression State of Particular Phase-Variable Lipooligosaccharide Biosynthetic Genes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833337,Infection and immunity,2019 05 05,"Nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) is a major human pathogen, responsible for several acute and chronic infections of the respiratory tract. The incidence of invasive infections caused by NTHi is increasing worldwide. NTHi is able to colonize the nasopharynx asymptomatically, and the exact change(s) responsible for transition from benign carriage to overt disease is not understood. We have previously reported that phase variation (the rapid and reversible ON-OFF switching of gene expression) of particular lipooligosaccharide (LOS) glycosyltransferases occurs during transition from colonizing the nasopharynx to invading the middle ear. Variation in the structure of the LOS is dependent on the ON/OFF expression status of each of the glycosyltransferases responsible for LOS biosynthesis. In this study, we surveyed a collection of invasive NTHi isolates for ON/OFF expression status of seven phase-variable LOS glycosyltransferases. We report that the expression state of the LOS biosynthetic genes oafA ON and lic2A OFF shows a correlation with invasive NTHi isolates. We hypothesize that these gene expression changes contribute to the invasive potential of NTHi. OafA expression, which is responsible for the addition of an O-acetyl group onto the LOS, has been shown to impart a phenotype of increased serum resistance and may serve as a marker for invasive NTHi.",The Mouse Inhalation Model of Cryptococcus neoformans Infection Recapitulates Strain Virulence in Humans and Shows that Closely Related Strains Can Possess Differential Virulence.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833336,Infection and immunity,2019 05 05,"Cryptococcal meningitis (CM) causes high rates of HIV-related mortality, yet the Cryptococcus factors influencing patient outcome are not well understood. Pathogen-specific traits, such as the strain genotype and degree of antigen shedding, are associated with the clinical outcome, but the underlying biology remains elusive. In this study, we examined factors determining disease outcome in HIV-infected cryptococcal meningitis patients infected with Cryptococcus neoformans strains with the same multilocus sequence type (MLST). Both patient mortality and survival were observed during infections with the same sequence type. Disease outcome was not associated with the patient CD4 count. Patient mortality was associated with higher cryptococcal antigen levels, the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) fungal burden by quantitative culture, and low CSF fungal clearance. The virulence of a subset of clinical strains with the same sequence type was analyzed using a mouse inhalation model of cryptococcosis. We showed a strong association between human and mouse mortality rates, demonstrating that the mouse inhalation model recapitulates human infection. Similar to human infection, the ability to multiply in vivo, demonstrated by a high fungal burden in lung and brain tissues, was associated with mouse mortality. Mouse survival time was not associated with single C. neoformans virulence factors in vitro or in vivo; rather, a trend in survival time correlated with a suite of traits. These observations show that MLST-derived genotype similarities between C. neoformans strains do not necessarily translate into similar virulence either in the mouse model or in human patients. In addition, our results show that in vitro assays do not fully reproduce in vivo conditions that influence C. neoformans virulence.",MroQ Is a Novel Abi-Domain Protein That Influences Virulence Gene Expression in Staphylococcus aureus via Modulation of Agr Activity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833335,Infection and immunity,2019 06 10,"Numerous factors have, to date, been identified as playing a role in the regulation of Agr activity in Staphylococcus aureus, including transcription factors, antisense RNAs, and host elements. Herein we investigated the product of SAUSA300_1984 (termed MroQ), a transmembrane Abi-domain/M79 protease-family protein, as a novel effector of this system. Using a USA300 mroQ mutant, we observed a drastic reduction in proteolysis, hemolysis, and pigmentation that was fully complementable. This appears to result from diminished agr activity, as transcriptional analysis revealed significant decreases in expression of both RNAII and RNAIII in the mroQ mutant. Such effects appear to be direct, rather than indirect, as known agr effectors demonstrated limited alterations in their activity upon mroQ disruption. A comparison of RNA sequencing data sets for both mroQ and agr mutants revealed a profound overlap in their regulomes, with the majority of factors affected being known virulence determinants. Importantly, the preponderance of alterations in expression were more striking in the agr mutant, indicating that MroQ is necessary, but not sufficient, for Agr function. Mechanism profiling revealed that putative residues for metalloprotease activity within MroQ are required for its Agr-controlling effect; however, this was not wielded at the level of AgrD processing. Virulence assessment demonstrated that both mroQ and agr mutants exhibited increased formation of renal abscesses but decreased skin abscess formation alongside diminished dermonecrosis. Collectively, we present the characterization of a novel agr effector in S. aureus which would appear to be a direct regulator, potentially functioning via interaction with the AgrC histidine kinase.",Control of Staphylococcus aureus Quorum Sensing by a Membrane-Embedded Peptidase.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833334,Infection and immunity,2019 05 05,"Gram-positive bacteria process and release small peptides, or pheromones, that act as signals for the induction of adaptive traits, including those involved in pathogenesis. One class of small signaling pheromones is the cyclic autoinducing peptides (AIPs), which regulate expression of genes that orchestrate virulence and persistence in a range of microbes, including staphylococci, listeriae, clostridia, and enterococci. In a genetic screen for Staphylococcus aureus secreted virulence factors, we identified an S. aureus mutant containing an insertion in the gene SAUSA300_1984 (mroQ), which encodes a putative membrane-embedded metalloprotease. A ΔmroQ mutant exhibited impaired induction of Toll-like receptor 2-dependent inflammatory responses from macrophages but elicited greater production of the inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1β and was attenuated in a murine skin and soft tissue infection model. The ΔmroQ mutant phenocopies an S. aureus mutant containing a deletion of the accessory gene regulatory system (Agr), wherein both strains have significantly reduced production of secreted toxins and virulence factors but increased surface protein A abundance. The Agr system controls virulence factor gene expression in S. aureus by sensing the accumulation of AIP via the histidine kinase AgrC and the response regulator AgrA. We provide evidence to suggest that MroQ acts within the Agr pathway to facilitate the optimal processing or export of AIP for signal amplification through AgrC/A and induction of virulence factor gene expression. Mutation of MroQ active-site residues significantly reduces AIP signaling and attenuates virulence. Altogether, this work identifies a new component of the Agr quorum-sensing circuit that is critical for the production of S. aureus virulence factors.",Dual Gene Expression Analysis Identifies Factors Associated with Staphylococcus aureus Virulence in Diabetic Mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833333,Infection and immunity,2019 06 10,"Staphylococcus aureus is a major human pathogen of the skin. The global burden of diabetes is high, with S. aureus being a major complication of diabetic wound infections. We investigated how the diabetic environment influences S. aureus skin infection and observed an increased susceptibility to infection in mouse models of both type I and type II diabetes. A dual gene expression approach was taken to investigate transcriptional alterations in both the host and bacterium after infection. While analysis of the host response revealed only minor changes between infected control and diabetic mice, we observed that S. aureus isolated from diabetic mice had significant increases in the levels of genes associated with translation and posttranslational modification and chaperones and reductions in the levels of genes associated with amino acid transport and metabolism. One family of genes upregulated in S. aureus isolated from diabetic lesions encoded the Clp proteases, associated with the misfolded protein response. The Clp proteases were found to be partially glucose regulated as well as influencing the hemolytic activity of S. aureus Strains lacking the Clp proteases ClpX, ClpC, and ClpP were significantly attenuated in our animal model of skin infection, with significant reductions observed in dermonecrosis and bacterial burden. In particular, mutations in clpP and clpX were significantly attenuated and remained attenuated in both normal and diabetic mice. Our data suggest that the diabetic environment also causes changes to occur in invading pathogens, and one of these virulence determinants is the Clp protease system.",Characterization of the horizontal and vertical sexual transmission of Chlamydia genital infections in a new mouse model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833332,Infection and immunity,2019 04 30,"Chlamydia trachomatis is the most common sexually transmitted bacterial pathogen worldwide and there is a need to control this epidemic. So far there is no established animal model in which both horizontal and vertical transmission of Chlamydia can be studied. To implement a horizontal sexual transmission model, male mice were inoculated in the meatus urethra with C. muridarum (Cm) and they were caged with naïve female mice. Urine and vaginal cultures were collected. To study vertical transmission newborns were euthanized and cultured. As controls, females were mated with sham-infected male mice. All Cm-inoculated male mice had positive urine cultures. As determined by serology, all females caged with Cm-inoculated males, became infected and 93% of them had positive vaginal cultures. More females, mated with Cm-infected male mice, were infertile (35%) than females mated with sham-infected male mice (0%) (P < 0.05). Also, Cm-infected females delivered significantly less pups (3.8±3.2/mouse) than control females (6.3±1.6) (P < 0.05). Of the newborn mice, 32% of them were Cm positive either in the lungs and/or intestines. Female mice housed with sham-infected males had no positive vaginal cultures or Cm-positive pups. This new horizontal and vertical sexual transmission mouse model closely parallels C. trachomatis sexual transmission in humans and may be a good model system to better understand the pathogenesis of these infections.",Loss of Trefoil Factor 2 Sensitizes Rat Pups to Systemic Infection with the Neonatal Pathogen Escherichia coli K1.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833331,Infection and immunity,2019 05 05,"Gastrointestinal (GI) colonization of 2-day-old (P2) rat pups with Escherichia coli K1 results in translocation of the colonizing bacteria across the small intestine, bacteremia, and invasion of the meninges, with animals frequently succumbing to lethal infection. Infection, but not colonization, is strongly age dependent; pups become progressively less susceptible to infection over the P2-to-P9 period. Colonization leads to strong downregulation of the gene encoding trefoil factor 2 (Tff2), preventing maturation of the protective mucus barrier in the small intestine. Trefoil factors promote mucosal homeostasis. We investigated the contribution of Tff2 to protection of the neonatal rat from E. coli K1 bacteremia and tissue invasion. Deletion of tff2, using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9, sensitized P9 pups to E. coli K1 bacteremia. There were no differences between tff2-/- homozygotes and the wild type with regard to the dynamics of GI colonization. Loss of the capacity to elaborate Tff2 did not impact GI tract integrity or the thickness of the small-intestinal mucus layer but, in contrast to P9 wild-type pups, enabled E. coli K1 bacteria to gain access to epithelial surfaces in the distal region of the small intestine and exploit an intracellular route across the epithelial monolayer to enter the blood circulation via the mesenteric lymphatic system. Although primarily associated with the mammalian gastric mucosa, we conclude that loss of Tff2 in the developing neonatal small intestine enables the opportunistic neonatal pathogen E. coli K1 to enter the compromised mucus layer in the distal small intestine prior to systemic invasion and infection."

However, MAPK-targeted therapies are not sustainably effective in most patients. Accordingly, characterizing mechanisms that co-operatively drive melanoma progression is key to improving patient outcomes. One possible mechanism is the Hippo signaling pathway, which regulates cancer progression via its central oncoproteins YAP and TAZ, although is thought to be only rarely affected by direct mutation. As YAP hyperactivation occurs in uveal melanoma, we investigated this oncogene in cutaneous melanoma. YAP protein expression was elevated in most benign nevi and primary cutaneous melanomas but present at only very low levels in normal melanocytes. In patient-derived xenografts and melanoma cell lines, we observed variable reliance of cell viability on Hippo pathway signaling that was independent of TAZ activity and also of classical melanoma driver mutations such as BRAF and NRAS. Finally, in genotyping studies of melanoma, we observed the first ever hyperactivating YAP mutations in a human cancer, manifest as seven distinct missense point mutations that caused serine to alanine transpositions. Strikingly, these mutate four serine residues known to be targeted by the Hippo pathway and we show that they lead to hyperactivation of YAP.Implications: Our studies highlight the YAP oncoprotein as a potential therapeutic target in select subgroups of melanoma patients, although successful treatment with anti-YAP therapies will depend on identification of biomarkers additional to YAP protein expression.",Parental Disengagement in Childhood and Adolescent Male Gun Carrying.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833298,Pediatrics,2019 06 10,To examine the association between parental disengagement in childhood and adolescent gun carrying and determine whether this association is accounted for by externalizing problems and affiliation with delinquent peers during early adolescence.,Social Media Influencer Marketing and Children's Food Intake: A Randomized Trial.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833297,Pediatrics,2019 04 02,To examine the impact of social media influencer marketing of foods (healthy and unhealthy) on children's food intake.,The zebrafish orthologue of the human hepatocerebral disease gene MPV17 plays pleiotropic roles in mitochondria.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833296,Disease models & mechanisms,2019 04 09,"Mitochondrial DNA depletion syndromes (MDS) are a group of rare autosomal recessive disorders with early onset and no cure available. MDS are caused by mutations in nuclear genes involved in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) maintenance, and characterized by both a strong reduction in mtDNA content and severe mitochondrial defects in affected tissues. Mutations in MPV17, a nuclear gene encoding a mitochondrial inner membrane protein, have been associated with hepatocerebral forms of MDS. The zebrafish mpv17 null mutant lacks the guanine-based reflective skin cells named iridophores and represents a promising model to clarify the role of Mpv17. In this study, we characterized the mitochondrial phenotype of mpv17-/- larvae and found early and severe ultrastructural alterations in liver mitochondria, as well as significant impairment of the respiratory chain, leading to activation of the mitochondrial quality control. Our results provide evidence for zebrafish Mpv17 being essential for maintaining mitochondrial structure and functionality, while its effects on mtDNA copy number seem to be subordinate. Considering that a role in nucleotide availability had already been postulated for MPV17, that embryos blocked in pyrimidine synthesis do phenocopy mpv17-/- knockouts (KOs) and that mpv17-/- KOs have impaired Dihydroorotate dehydrogenase activity, we provided mpv17 mutants with the pyrimidine precursor orotic acid (OA).

Here, we report on the chromosome-level genome assembly of European grayling (Thymallus thymallus), which represents one of the earliest diverged salmonid subfamilies. To achieve this, we first generated relatively long genomic scaffolds by using a previously published draft genome assembly along with long-read sequencing data and a linkage map. We then merged those scaffolds by applying synteny evidence from the Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) genome. Comparisons of the European grayling genome assembly to the genomes of Atlantic salmon and Northern pike (Esox lucius), the latter used as a nonduplicated outgroup, detailed aspects of the characteristic chromosome evolution process that has taken place in European grayling. While Atlantic salmon and other salmonid genomes are portrayed by the typical occurrence of numerous chromosomal fusions, European grayling chromosomes were confirmed to be fusion-free and were characterized by a relatively large proportion of paracentric and pericentric inversions. We further reported on transposable elements specific to either the European grayling or Atlantic salmon genome, on the male-specific sdY gene in the European grayling chromosome 11A, and on regions under residual tetrasomy in the homeologous European grayling chromosome pairs 9A-9B and 25A-25B. The same chromosome pairs have been observed under residual tetrasomy in Atlantic salmon and in other salmonids, suggesting that this feature has been conserved since the subfamily split.",Hfq-dependent mRNA unfolding promotes sRNA-based inhibition of translation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833291,The EMBO journal,2019 04 12,"Small RNAs post-transcriptionally regulate many processes in bacteria. Base-pairing of sRNAs near ribosome-binding sites in mRNAs inhibits translation, often requiring the RNA chaperone Hfq. In the canonical model, Hfq simultaneously binds sRNAs and mRNA targets to accelerate pairing. Here, we show that the Escherichia coli sRNAs OmrA and OmrB inhibit translation of the diguanylate cyclase DgcM (previously: YdaM), a player in biofilm regulation. In OmrA/B repression of dgcM, Hfq is not required as an RNA interaction platform, but rather unfolds an inhibitory RNA structure that impedes OmrA/B binding. This restructuring involves distal face binding of Hfq and is supported by RNA structure mapping. A corresponding mutant protein cannot support inhibition in vitro and in vivo; proximal and rim mutations have negligible effects. Strikingly, OmrA/B-dependent translational inhibition in vitro is restored, in complete absence of Hfq, by a deoxyoligoribonucleotide that base-pairs to the biochemically mapped Hfq site in dgcM mRNA We suggest that Hfq-dependent RNA structure remodeling can promote sRNA access, which represents a mechanism distinct from an interaction platform model.",Computational Complexity as an Ultimate Constraint on Evolution.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833289,Genetics,2019 06 10,"Experiments show that evolutionary fitness landscapes can have a rich combinatorial structure due to epistasis. For some landscapes, this structure can produce a computational constraint that prevents evolution from finding local fitness optima-thus overturning the traditional assumption that local fitness peaks can always be reached quickly if no other evolutionary forces challenge natural selection. Here, I introduce a distinction between easy landscapes of traditional theory where local fitness peaks can be found in a moderate number of steps, and hard landscapes where finding local optima requires an infeasible amount of time. Hard examples exist even among landscapes with no reciprocal sign epistasis; on these semismooth fitness landscapes, strong selection weak mutation dynamics cannot find the unique peak in polynomial time. More generally, on hard rugged fitness landscapes that include reciprocal sign epistasis, no evolutionary dynamics-even ones that do not follow adaptive paths-can find a local fitness optimum quickly. Moreover, on hard landscapes, the fitness advantage of nearby mutants cannot drop off exponentially fast but has to follow a power-law that long-term evolution experiments have associated with unbounded growth in fitness. Thus, the constraint of computational complexity enables open-ended evolution on finite landscapes. Knowing this constraint allows us to use the tools of theoretical computer science and combinatorial optimization to characterize the fitness landscapes that we expect to see in nature. I present candidates for hard landscapes at scales from single genes, to microbes, to complex organisms with costly learning (Baldwin effect) or maintained cooperation (Hankshaw effect). Just how ubiquitous hard landscapes (and the corresponding ultimate constraint on evolution) are in nature becomes an open empirical question.",In Vitro Inhibition of Carboxylesterase 1 by Major Cannabinoids and Selected Metabolites.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833288,Drug metabolism and disposition: the biological fate of chemicals,2019 03 29,"The escalating use of medical cannabis and significant recreational use of cannabis in recent years has led to a higher potential for metabolic interactions between cannabis or one or more of its components and concurrently used medications. Although there have been a significant number of in vitro and in vivo assessments of the effects of cannabis on cytochrome P450 and UDP-glucuronosyltransferase enzyme systems, there is limited information regarding the effects of cannabis on the major hepatic esterase, carboxylesterase 1 (CES1). In this study, we investigated the in vitro inhibitory effects of the individual major cannabinoids and metabolites ∆9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), cannabidiol (CBD), cannabinol (CBN), 11-nor-THC-carboxylic acid, and 11-hydroxy-THC on CES1 activity. S9 fractions from human embryonic kidney 293 cells stably expressing CES1 were used in the assessment of cannabinoid inhibitory effects. THC, CBD, and CBN each exhibited substantial inhibitory potency, and were further studied to determine their mechanism of inhibition and kinetic parameters. The inhibition of CES1 by THC, CBD, and CBN was reversible and appears to proceed through a mixed competitive-noncompetitive mechanism. The inhibition constant (Ki) values for THC, CBD, and CBN inhibition were 0.541, 0.974, and 0.263 µM (0.170, 0.306, and 0.0817 µg/ml), respectively. Inhibition potency was increased when THC, CBD, and CBN were combined. Compared with the potential unbound plasma concentrations attainable clinically, the Ki values suggest a potential for clinically significant inhibition of CES1 by THC and CBD. CBN, however, is expected to have a limited impact on CES1. Carefully designed clinical studies are warranted to establish the clinical significance of these in vitro findings."

Different removal efficiencies of the selected EOMs were observed and explained based on their physicochemical properties (such as distribution coefficient, log D; dissociation constant, pKa; solid-water distribution coefficients, and Kd) along with process operating parameters. The dominant removal mechanisms of EOMs were biotransformation and sorption onto the sludge, which were confirmed by the mass balance study. Moreover, changes in the sludge properties, as a consequence of different SRTs, were evaluated based on variations in soluble microbial products (SMP), extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), and capillary suction time (CST).

Emission Trading Scheme (ETS) is a feasible way to reduce CO2. Little research concentrated on the ETS fines for excessive emission. We analyzed the different impacts of fine mechanisms in ETS by applying computable general equilibrium model and constructed seven scenarios. We found that although Gross Domestic Product (GDP) loss is not significant when applying ETS market, GDP loss would increase rapidly when ETS fine increases. The CO2 abatement effect of alterable ETS fine is a bit better than that of fixed fine. Higher fines will cause relatively lower carbon intensity compared with lower ETS fines, which is caused by different emission reduction effect in different scenarios. It seems that ETS fines cannot affect reduction costs as significantly as GDP loss rate and emission reduction. ETS fine can affect significantly ETS cost of enterprises, commodity price and output of energy-intensive industries as well as GDP loss and CO2 abatement, but can less influence carbon emission intensity and reduction cost. A proper ETS fine is very important and ETS fines in China's ETS market are 2-3 times of carbon price. We consider that the current government design is reasonable.",Effects of nitrogen loading on emission of carbon gases from estuarine tidal marshes with varying salinity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833263,The Science of the total environment,2019 03 22,"Estuarine tidal marshes sequester significant quantities of carbon and are suffering from anthropogenic nitrogen (N) enhancement. However, the effects of this N loading on carbon gas emissions from freshwater-oligohaline tidal marshes are unknown. In this paper, we report on our evaluation of the effects of a N gradient (0, 24, 48 and 96 g NH4NO3-N m-2 y-1) on the methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from freshwater and oligohaline tidal marshes in the Min River estuary, southeast China. On an annual scale, the oligohaline marsh has significantly higher CO2 emissions, while it has slightly lower CH4 emissions relative to freshwater marsh. The addition of N increased CH4 emission from the freshwater marsh and decreased CH4 emission from the oligohaline marsh, although there was no statistically significant difference in CH4 emission between either of the two marshes and the control. The addition of 96 g NH4NO3-N m-2 y-1 significantly increased CO2 emission from the freshwater marsh, while it did not significantly influence CO2 emission from the oligohaline marsh. CH4 and CO2 emission levels were positively correlated with soil temperature under all conditions. The CH4 flux resulting from both the control and the addition of N was negatively correlated with porewater SO42- and Cl- concentrations and soil EC in the oligohaline marsh. Overall, N addition significantly increased carbon gas emissions under freshwater conditions while slightly inhibiting carbon gas emissions from the oligohaline marsh. Our findings suggested that even under low salinity conditions, the effects of N loading on CH4 and CO2 emissions from freshwater and oligohaline tidal marshes can vary. We propose that the addition of N to estuarine tidal marshes has a significant effect on the carbon cycle and promotes soil carbon loss, phenomena which may be influenced by salinity.",Snow buntings (Plectrophenax nivealis) as bio-indicators for exposure differences to legacy and emerging persistent organic pollutants from the Arctic terrestrial environment on Svalbard.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833262,The Science of the total environment,2019 04 05,"Eggs of snow buntings (Plectrophenax nivealis) were applied as a bio-indicator to examine differences in exposure to legacy persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and perflouroalkyl subtances (PFAS) from the terrestrial environment surrounding the settlements of Longyearbyen, Barentsburg and Pyramiden on Svalbard, Norway. Significantly higher concentrations of summed polychlorinated biphenyls (sumPCB7) in eggs collected from Barentsburg (2980 ng/g lipid weight (lw)) and Pyramiden (3860 ng/g lw) compared to Longyearbyen (96 ng/g lw) are attributed to local sources of PCBs within these settlements. Similar findings were observed for p,p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (p,p'-DDE) where higher median concentrations observed in Pyramiden (173 ng/g lw) and Barentsburg (75 ng/g lw) compared to Longyearbyen (48 ng/g lw) may be influenced by guano inputs from breeding seabird populations, although other point sources cannot be ruled out. Concentrations of perfluorooctane sulphonate (PFOS) and several perfluorinated carboxylic acids (PFCAs) in snow bunting eggs were found to be statistically higher in the populated settlements of Longyearbyen and Barentsburg compared to the abandoned Pyramiden. Narrow foraging ranges of snow buntings during breeding season was useful in assessing point sources of exposure for PCBs and PFAS at particular sites with extreme differences observed between nest locations. SumPCB7 concentrations ranged from 2 μg/g ww to below detection limits between nest sites located less than a kilometer from each other in Pyramiden. Similar findings were observed in Longyearbyen, where several PFCAs ranged from 2 to 55 times higher between nest sites with similar spatial distances. These findings indicate that snow buntings can be a useful bio-indicator offering high spatial resolution for contaminant source apportionment in terrestrial environments on Svalbard.","Spatial distribution of mercury in seawater, sediment, and seafood from the Hardangerfjord ecosystem, Norway.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833261,The Science of the total environment,2019 04 05,"Hardangerfjord is one of the longest fjords in the world and has historical mercury (Hg) contamination from a zinc plant in its inner sector. In order to investigate the extent of Hg transferred to abiotic and biotic ecosystem compartments, Hg and monomethylmercury (MeHg) concentrations were measured in seawater, sediment, and seafood commonly consumed by humans. Although total mercury in seawater has been described previously, this investigation reports novel MeHg data for seawater from Norwegian fjords. Total Hg and MeHg concentrations in seawater, sediment, and biota increased towards the point source of pollution (PSP) and multiple lines of evidence show a clear PSP effect in seawater and sediment concentrations. In fish, however, similar high concentrations were found in the inner part of another branch adjacent to the PSP. We postulate that, in addition to PSP, atmospheric Hg, terrestrial run-off and hydroelectric power stations are also important sources of Hg in this fjord ecosystem. Hg contamination gradually increased towards the inner part of the fjord for most fish species and crustaceans. Since the PSP and the atmospheric Hg pools were greater towards the inner part of the fjord, it is not entirely possible to discriminate the full extent of the PSP and the atmospheric Hg contribution to the fjord food web. The European Union (EU) Hg maximum level for consumption was exceeded in demersal fish species including tusk (Brosme brosme), blue ling (Molva dypterygia) and common ling (Molva molva) from the inner fjord (1.08 to 1.89 mg kg-1 ww) and from the outer fjord (0.49 to 1.07 mg kg-1 ww). Crustaceans were less contaminated and only European lobster (Homarus gammarus) from inner fjord exceeded the EU limit (0.62 mg kg-1 ww).

A synthetic methane-free gaseous stream (SMGS) similar to biogas was used as inorganic carbon source and model of biogas upgrading. The microalgae CO2 fixation rates were calculated through a novel methodology based on an inorganic carbon mass balance under continuous scrubbing of a SMGS similar to biogas, where the influence of pH and temperature time-depended oscillations were successfully incorporated into the mass balances. The oxygenic activity and carbon fixation occurred at different non-stoichiometric rates during the diurnal phase, in average carbon fixation predominated over oxygen production (photosynthesis quotient PQ≈ 0.5 mol O2 mol-1 CO2) indicating photorespiration occurrence mainly under dissolved oxygen concentrations higher than 10 mg L-1. The oxygen and inorganic carbon mass balances demonstrated that photorespiration and endogenous respiration were responsible for losing up to 66% and 7% respectively of the biomass grew at diurnal periods under optimal conditions. In favoring photorespiration conditions, the microalgae biomass productivity (CO2 effectively captured) can be severely decreased. A kinetic mathematical model as a function of temperature and irradiance of the oxygenic photosynthetic activity indicated the optimal operation zone for this outdoor alkaline open-photobioreactor, where irradiance was found being the most influential parameter.",Nutrients mediate the effects of temperature on methylmercury concentrations in freshwater zooplankton.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833259,The Science of the total environment,2019 04 05,"Methylmercury (MeHg) bioaccumulation in freshwater aquatic systems is impacted by anthropogenic stressors, including climate change and nutrient enrichment. The goal of this study was to determine how warmer water temperatures and excess nutrients would alter zooplankton communities and phytoplankton concentrations, and whether those changes would in turn increase or decrease MeHg concentrations in freshwater zooplankton. To test this, we employed a 2 × 2 factorial experimental design with nutrient and temperature treatments. Mesocosms were filled with ambient water and plankton from Cottage Grove Reservoir, Oregon, U.S.A., a waterbody that has experienced decades of elevated MeHg concentrations and corresponding fish consumption advisories due to run-off from Black Butte Mine tailings, located within the watershed. Treatment combinations of warmer temperature (increased by 0.7 °C), nutrient addition (a single pulse of 10× ambient concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorous), control, and a combination of temperature and nutrients were applied to mesocosms. The individual treatments altered phytoplankton densities and community structure, but alone the effects on MeHg concentrations were muted. Importantly, we found a significant interactive effect of nutrients and temperature: the nutrient addition appeared to buffer against increased MeHg concentrations associated with elevated temperature. However, there was variability in this response, which seems to be related to the abundance of Daphnia and edible phytoplankton. Nutrients at low temperature were associated with marginal increases (1.1×) in zooplankton MeHg. Our findings suggest that global change drivers that influence community composition and ecosystem energetics of both zooplankton and phytoplankton can alter MeHg pathways through food webs.",Per- and polyfluorinated compounds in saleswomen's urine linked to indoor dust in clothing shops.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833258,The Science of the total environment,2019 04 05,"This study aims to investigate the characteristics of typical per- and polyfluorinated compounds (PFCs) in indoor dust from clothing shops and urine sampled from saleswomen. A total of 58 indoor dust samples and 73 urine samples from saleswomen were collected from clothing shops in Shanghai, China. All samples were analyzed for PFCs using high-performance liquid chromatography tandem triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS). The mean PFC concentrations in indoor dust ranged from 0.42 (PFDA) to 5.04 ng g-1 (PFDoA). PFDoA and PFHxS were the most prominent PFCs, with median concentrations of 2.95 ng g-1 and 1.49 ng g-1, respectively. The median PFC concentrations in urine ranged from 10.15 (PFDS) to 666.1 ng l-1 (PFOA) and PFOA was the most abundant chemical with concentrations ranging from 207 to 907 ng l-1. A significant positive correlation was obtained between long-chain PFCs in dust and in urine (p < 0.01). Daily intake values of PFCs via dust ingestion were also calculated, and even under high-end exposure scenarios, the intake of PFOA (36.5 pg day-1) and PFOS (56.7 pg day-1) were well within the tolerable daily intake values. These results are important to both characterize PFC levels and estimate the saleswomen's exposure to PFCs from indoor dust.",Accumulation and toxicity of thiamethoxam and its metabolite clothianidin to the gonads of Eremias argus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833257,The Science of the total environment,2019 04 05,"The endocrine disrupting effect of pesticides is considered to be an important factor in the decline of reptile populations. The large-scale application of neonicotinoids in the environment poses a potential threat to small farmland lizards Eremias argus. In this study, we evaluated the disruption effects of thiamethoxam and its metabolite clothianidin on the endocrine disruption of Eremias argus during 28 d exposure. Thiamethoxam and clothianidin could accumulate in the testis and ovary. Adequate blood exchange was the main cause of thiamethoxam and clothianidin accumulation in the gonads. The production of clothianidin aggravated the effect of endocrine disruption to lizards. Thiamethoxam/clothianidin exhibited two distinct ways of interfering with the endocrine disruption of the male and female lizards. Thiamethoxam/clothianidin significantly up-regulated the expression of cyp17 and cyp19 genes in the testis, which ultimately led to a significant decrease in testosterone levels and a significant increase in the 17-estradiol concentrations in plasma. The expression of the estrogen receptor gene in the liver was also significantly increased in male lizards. The significant declines in testosterone and prostaglandin D2 levels in the plasma indicated that thiamethoxam and clothianidin could cause androgen deficiency in male lizards. Meanwhile, in female lizards, thiamethoxam/clothianidin increased the expression of hsd17β gene in the ovary, causing an increase in testosterone levels in the plasma and an up-regulation of androgen receptor expression in the liver. The effects of thiamethoxam and clothianidin on male lizards were more pronounced. This study verified the possible endocrine disrupting effects of neonicotinoids and provided a new perspective for the study of global recession of reptiles.",Effect of pyrolysis conditions on the total contents of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in biochars produced from organic residues: Assessment of their hazard potential.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833256,The Science of the total environment,2019 04 05,"The interest of using biochar, the solid byproduct from organic waste pyrolysis, as soil conditioner is significantly increasing. Nevertheless, persistent organic pollutants, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), are formed during pyrolysis due to the incomplete combustion of organic matter. Consequently, these pollutants may enter the environment when biochar is incorporated into soil and cause adverse ecological effects. In this study, we examined the content of the 16 United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) PAHs in biochars produced from rice husk, wood, wheat and sewage sludge residues using three different pyrolytic reactors and temperatures (400, 500 and 600 °C). The total concentration of PAHs (∑PAH) ranged from 799 to 6364 μg kg-1, being naphthalene, phenanthrene and anthracene the most abundant PAHs in all the biochars. The maximum amount of PAHs was observed for the rice husk biochar produced in the batch reactor at 400 °C, which decreased with increasing temperature. The ∑PAH value of the wood biochar produced via traditional kilns doubled compared with the wood biochar produced using the other pyrolytic reactors (5330 μg kg-1 in Kiln; 2737 μg kg-1 in batch and 1942 μg kg-1 in the rotary reactor). Looking for a more reliable risk assessment of the potential exposure of PAHs in biochar, the total toxic equivalent concentrations (TTEC) of the 14 produced biochars were calculated. When comparing the same feedstock and temperature, TTEC values indicated that the rotary reactor produced the safest biochars. In contrast, the biochars produced using the batch reactor at 400 and 500 °C have the greatest hazard potential. Our results provide valuable information on the potential risk of biochar application for human and animal health, as well as for the environment due to PAHs contamination."

Usually, PFCs can co-exist in various environment. Therefore, over- or under-estimated risk assessments would result if antagonism or synergism occurred in mixture toxicity. In the present study, the acute and chronic toxicities of single and mixtures of PFOA and PFOS to Daphnia magna were investigated. PFOS was more toxic than PFOA, both in 48-h acute toxicity and 21-d chronic toxicity. In acute toxicity tests, mixture toxicities showed strong synergistic effects on mortality. The experimental EC50 of the mixture is 4.44 × 10-5 mol/L, whereas the predicted EC50 is 8.19 × 10-5 mol/L by Concentration Addition Model and 9.73 × 10-5 mol/L by Independent Action Model. In chronic toxicity tests, synergistic effects were also found in the aspects of offspring. The offspring rate is reduced significantly to 39.8% at the 9.61 × 10-7 mol/L of mixture, while, PFOS and PFOA do not have effects when they are tested individually at corresponding concentrations. To explore the potential mechanism of the synergistic effect, the interactions between PFCs and proteins, including acetylcholinesterase, superoxide dismutase, catalase, ecdysone receptor and glutathione-S-transferase, were investigated by the Molecular Docking. The docking results revealed that the driving forces for the binding of PFCs with proteins were predominantly hydrophobic and hydrogen-bonding interactions. Based on the binding models, we deduced that the potential mechanism of synergism is that PFOS and PFOA have similar binding modes with catalase and have different binding modes with superoxide dismutase. Overall, these data provide experimental evidence that there is strong synergism in acute and chronic toxicity of mixtures to D. magna and demonstrate that molecular structure of some components of the antioxidant defence system contributes to the synergistic interaction.","Microplastics in surface waters and sediments of the Wei River, in the northwest of China.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833241,The Science of the total environment,2019 03 22,"Microplastic pollution is an increasingly important environment problem. Many studies show the occurrence of microplastics in our environmental system. However, the freshwater system is less understood, especially in northwest China. We investigated the occurrence and characteristics of microplastics in the Wei River Basin, which is located in northwestern China. The Wei River is the largest tributary of the Yellow River and runs through three major provinces. In the Wei River, the concentration of microplastics in the surface waters varied from 3.67 to 10.7 items /L and in the sediments, the abundance of microplastics varied from 360 to 1320 items/kg. Fiber (50.1%)was the dominant types in water samples and sediments. The small size (<0.5 mm)(68.1%)were the main size of microplastics in Wei River. The types of microplastics were polyethylene, Polyvinyl chloride and polystyrene, as identified using a Fourier transform infrared spectrometer. This study could be a valuable reference for better understanding the microplastics pollution in inland northwestern China.",Identifying hotspots and representative monitoring area of groundwater changes with time stability analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833240,The Science of the total environment,2019 03 22,"Groundwater is a most accessible freshwater resource for human beings, and it is increasingly important as an alternative to surface water under the threat of climate change. However, its complex spatio-temporal dynamic remains unattended from management perspective. Past studies on groundwater management were stalled by a relative dearth of high-quality data and a lack of synthetic analysis on both spatial and temporal information. Thanks to NASA's launch of Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite mission, our study has solved these two problems by innovatively applying time stability analysis to GRACE-based groundwater data. Taking the Yellow River Basin (YRB) as an example, we employed GRACE satellite data to obtain monthly changes of groundwater tables from Jan. 2003 to Dec. 2016 in 1.0-degree grid of spatial resolution. Then we identified hotspots (which indicated severe groundwater declines and fluctuations over time) and representative monitoring areas (which stably represented the spatial average over time) using time stability analysis. Time stability employs multiple coefficients to identify the spatial relations between local variables and global variables overtime, thus showing the overall effect of spatial-wise and temporal-wise factors but never used in groundwater studies before. Based on this innovative method, we further identified management categories across the YRB using multivariate cluster analysis. As a result, the YRB has been divided into five zones for different management strategies. We identified the hotspots in west-most and east-most areas of the YRB, where we suggest a strengthened groundwater protections and risk response system. The northern part of the middle reach in the YRB was also identified as the representative monitoring areas. With these knowledge, decision-makers can have a clearer regional plan for groundwater protection, monitoring, and risk response system. This new method enables a quick decision on the prioritized areas for different groundwater management strategies while not losing the scope of spatio-temporal heterogeneity.",Evaluation of the use of eucalyptus to control algae bloom and improve water quality.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833239,The Science of the total environment,2019 04 05,"Lakes represent an important source of drinking water resource for human beings. The presence of harmful algae blooms can pose a serious threat to lakes water quality. This study explored the feasibility of using eucalyptus plants and leaves extracts for controlling algae proliferation in an aquatic milieu. After 30 days of treatment, the inhibitory efficiencies were 85.8% and 20.9% for treatments planting eucalyptus and eucalyptus leaves extracts, respectively. The synergistic effects of allelopathy and competitive absorption for macro nutrients were attributed to the effective control of algae proliferation in the mesocosm systems. Moreover, the analysis of microbial community structures indicated that eucalyptus plants or leaves extracts had no adverse effect on species diversity and their relative abundance. The choice of using eucalyptus to control algae bloom will be dictated by environmental and economic considerations within a geographical region.",Role of recent climate change on carbon sequestration in peatland systems.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833238,The Science of the total environment,2019 04 05,"This paper provides information on the impact of recent climate change on carbon sequestration in peatland systems in South West England. This is important because peatlands have the potential to sequester and hold large quantities of anthropogenically released CO2. This paper investigates whether there has been a reduction in the strength of carbon sinks in a valley mire and blanket bog, which occur on the limits of the biogeographical envelop for peatlands in Britain. Past rates of carbon accumulation were calculated from peat depth and the sequential analysis of peat age, bulk density and carbon content from cores taken from valley mire and blanket bog. At the valley mire site contemporary net ecosystem carbon balance (NECB) was calculated by measuring inputs to the peat body, via net primary productivity (NPP), of Sphagna. Losses of C from the peat body were calculated by measuring CH4, and aquatic carbon, calculated from catchment export of particulate and dissolved organic carbon. The study found similar mean rates of carbon accumulation since 1850 of 11.26 t ± 0.68 t CO2e ha-1 yr-1 (307 g C m-2 yr-1) in valley mire and 11.77 t ± 0.88 t CO2e ha-1 yr-1 (321 g C m-2 yr-1) in blanket bog. The mean present-day CO2 sequestration rate for Sphagna on valley mire was calculated to be 9.13 t ± 0.98 t CO2e ha-1 yr-1 (249 g C m-2 yr-1). Both past and contemporary rates of CO2 sequestration were found to be at the maxima of those reported for temperate peatlands. NPP was found to vary according to microform with higher rates of carbon sequestration found in lawn and hummock microforms compared with pools. Our work suggests that recent changes in the climate appear to have had limited impact on the strength of peatland carbon sinks in South West England.",Multi-scale analysis of functional plankton diversity in floodplain wetlands: Effects of river regulation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833237,The Science of the total environment,2019 04 05,"Riverine floodplains are among the most diverse and dynamic ecosystems, but river regulation measures have altered the natural hydrological regime threatening their ecological integrity. We compared spatial patterns of phyto- and zooplankton functional diversity and of environmental heterogeneity between floodplain wetlands located in free-flowing and impounded stretches of the Danube River (Austria). We included two nested spatial scales (different habitats and water sections within wetland areas) and two contrasting hydrological conditions (post-flood, no flood). Environmental heterogeneity was lower in the wetland in the impounded stretch than in the free-flowing ones. At post-flood conditions, increased alpha diversity of rotifers and microcrustaceans and decreased beta diversity of phytoplankton and rotifers occurred in the impounded stretch as compared to the wetlands in free-flowing one. Beta diversity was higher between water sections than between habitats in free-flowing wetlands and similar across scales in the wetland in the impounded stretch. Regarding functional composition, the wetland in the impounded stretch hosted more homogeneous communities, as some ecological traits were nearly absent. Our results indicate that patterns of functional diversity in floodplain wetlands affected by river regulation are altered, highlighting the major role of the gradient of lateral connectivity and dynamic water level fluctuations as drivers for planktic diversity in river floodplains. This study contributes with essential knowledge to optimize restoration and diversity conservation measures in riverine ecosystems.",Measurement and modeling the gas/particle partitioning of organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) in atmosphere at low temperatures.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833236,The Science of the total environment,2019 03 22,"The gas/particle (G/P) partition of organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) has been widely investigated and well documented, but rare at low temperature. In this study, seventy-four pairs of air samples in two sampling sites in northeastern China at a wide ambient temperature range of ~63 °C (-40 to +23 °C) were simultaneously collected in both gaseous and particulate phases and eighteen OCPs in these samples were measured and analyzed, among which, partition quotient (KP) values for fifteen OCPs were determined. Seven models including those have never been used for OCPs were applied to predict the values of KP, and the results were compared with the monitoring data for the fifteen OCPs. It was found out that, L-M-Y model provided advantages over the other models, with the best agreement to the monitoring data for analyzed OCPs (90.1 ± 11.1% data points within ±1 log unit, RMSE: 0.53 ± 0.18). The predicted maximum partition (MP) domain for eleven OCPs was observed with high values of their logarithm of octanol-air partition coefficient (log KOA > 12.5), where the log KP values become a constant (-1.53), indicating that the G/P partition of OCPs is in steady state but not the equilibrium. The Li-Ma-Yang (L-M-Y model) model, considering the wet and dry depositions of particles, elucidates the necessity of non-equilibrium term for the OCPs at low temperature. These results indicate that the L-M-Y model is valid for OCPs, which renders it highly promising for describing the partition behaviors in atmosphere for SVOCs, particularly at low temperature. An equation to calculate the condensation temperature TC was also derived, which gave a new understanding on the situation of chemicals with equal distribution between gaseous and particulate phases of OCPs and other similar SVOCs, especially in Polar Regions.",Arsenic removal from geothermal influenced groundwater with low pressure NF pilot plant for drinking water production in Nicaraguan rural communities.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833235,The Science of the total environment,2019 03 22,"This research evaluated the effect of different fluxes (16, 23 & 30 L/m2 h) and temperatures (31,35 & 43 °C) on the rejection of As(V) during nanofiltration (NF) of natural geothermal influenced groundwater in Nicaragua. A NF pilot plant powered by solar panels was built and operated in rural community Telica, exposed to As-rich drinking water sources due to geothermal influences. The results showed that even at high temperatures it is possible to obtain high rejection of As(V) (0.87-0.9) during NF filtration (recovery 10%; flux 16 L/m2 h) of geothermal influenced groundwater, with the additional advantage of requiring low operating pressures (1.2 bar ~ 12mwc). The permeate concentration (~5 μg/L) complied with the WHO guideline for drinking water and the concentrate (~55 μg/L) could be used by local villagers for daily activities (e.g., laundry and bathing). For all investigated fluxes and temperatures the order of rejection of As(V) (as HAsO42-), compared with the other anions, could be interpreted on the basis of its charge, hydrated radius and hydration free energy. At lower temperatures (31 and 35 °C) permeate quality improved slightly (~3 μg/L), but although an increased temperature had a negative effect on the As rejection, As concentrations in the permeate never exceeded 5 μg/L, while the required TMP dropped - depending on the flux - with 0.5 to 1 bar. This decrease in required pressure might be of huge benefit in deserted, rural locations where electricity is scarce, as with an overhead tank of 10-15 m a gravity-fed NF system would be feasible.",A nonradical reaction-dominated phenol degradation with peroxydisulfate catalyzed by nitrogen-doped graphene.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833234,The Science of the total environment,2019 03 22,"Nitrogen doping is a common approach for functionalization of graphene to generate active sites for catalytic reactions. However, the effect of nitrogen content and species within nitrogen-doped graphene (NG) on catalytic phenol oxidation remains largely unaddressed, especially for the peroxidisulfate (PDS) system. In this work, graphene (G), NH3•H2O-reduced graphene (NG-NH3), and N2H4-reduced graphene (NG-N2H4) with different nitrogen contents were synthesized, and their catalytic abilities in inducing PDS was evaluated. The degradation results indicated that nitrogen doping improved the catalytic ability of G and NG-NH3 shows a higher catalytic ability than NG-N2H4, even though they have similar nitrogen contents. Based on the XPS spectra, among all the doped nitrogen species, the graphitic N made the greatest contribution to the catalytic activity. The scavenger and electron paramagnetic resonance results imply a major contribution of a nonradical mechanism in the NG-PDS-phenol reaction system. Finally, the hydroquinone and p-hydroxybenzoic acid were identified as two intermediate products during the degradation. The decrease in total organic carbon concentration (TOC) after reaction confirmed that phenol was mineralized partially in CO2. These findings will guide the applications of NG as a catalyst and enrich our understanding of the PDS-phenol reaction system.",Tourette's syndrome is associated with an increased risk of traumatic brain injury: A nationwide population-based cohort study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833232,Parkinsonism & related disorders,2019 03 05,"Violent motor tics or severe self-harm behaviors have been reported in patients with Tourette's syndrome (TS) and leading to traumatic brain injury (TBI).

The Bessel vibration pattern of the radial modes was experimentally measured using Laser Doppler Vibrometry and was found to be in very good agreement with those obtained from numerical simulations. Ultrasonic beam profiles from the first four radial modes of the piezoelectric disc were measured using a hydrophone in a water tank. The results obtained from the experimental scans were compared to the predictions from an analytical model and were found to be in very good agreement. Also, the Bessel beams generated from the radial modes (except the first) of the piezoelectric discs were found to have narrow beam width for the central lobe compared to those from an ideal piston source of same size.

By using piezoelectric ceramics, the vibration modes of two parallel beams are excited and coupled to form in-plane waves on the ring. As the piezoelectric actuator has the dual effect of acting as the power source and the main body structure of the arm joint, compared with the rotating joint using DC motor as the power source, the actuator does not need additional space to install the motor, which makes joint mechanism have the advantages of simple structure and small volume. Furthermore, the micro-displacement control of joints can be achieved by the characteristics of fast response and power self-locking based on the friction driving principle. A two-degree-of-freedom three-arm prototype of the joint mechanism is designed to obtain the parameters of the piezoelectric actuator and carry out related experiments. The prototype of the mechanism is 72 g in weight and 105 mm in length, and the maximum rotation angle of each joint is 210 deg. The experimental results indicate that, when driving frequency is 58.6 kHz and the driving voltage is 300 Vpp, the angular speed of the prototype reaches 45.9 deg/s, the resolution is 0.015 deg and the startup and shutdown response time are 35 ms and 21 ms, respectively.

The method called fundamental wave amplitude difference (FAD) consists of a sequence of acquisitions with different subsets of elements for each line of the image. An image revealing nonlinear scatterers in the medium is reconstructed line by line by subtracting the responses measured with the subsets of elements from the response obtained with all elements transmitting. In order to get a better insight of the capabilities of FAD, two metallic samples having a fatigue or thermal crack are inspected by translating the probe with ultrasonic beam perpendicular (i.e. parallel) to the crack direction which is the most (i.e. less) favorable case. Each time, the responses of the linear scatterers (i.e. conventional image) and nonlinear scatterers (i.e. FAD image) are compared in term of intensity and spatial repartition. FAD exhibits higher detection specificity of the crack with a better contrast than conventional ultrasound imaging. Moreover, we observe that both methods give complementary results as nonlinear and linear scatterers are mostly not co-localized. In addition, we show experimentally that FAD resolution in elevation and lateral follows the same rule as the theoretical resolution of conventional ultrasonic technique. Finally, we report that FAD gives the possibility to perform parametric studies which let the opportunity to address the physical mechanisms causing the distortion of the signal. FAD is a promising and reliable tool which can be directly implemented on a conventional open scanner ultrasound device for real-time imaging. This might contribute to its fast and wide spread in the industry.",On the determination of the third-order elastic constants of homogeneous isotropic materials utilising Rayleigh waves.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833179,Ultrasonics,2019 06 13,"This paper presents a new method for determining the third-order elastic constants (TOECs) of a homogeneous isotropic material utilising the acoustoelastic effect associated with Rayleigh waves. It is demonstrated that the accuracy of the evaluation of TOECs can be substantially improved by supplementing the classical equations of acoustoelasticity, which describe the effect of applied stress on bulk wave speeds, with the nonlinear characteristic equation for the propagation of Rayleigh waves in pre-stressed media. The developed method can be readily implemented for Structural Health Monitoring applications; for example, the measurement of applied stresses based on the acoustoelastic effect, or the monitoring of near-surface microstructural damage based on the change in magnitude of the TOECs."

We seek to determine the bias of TN-based VE estimates during a pandemic using a dynamic probability model. The model is used to evaluate and compare the bias of VE estimates under various sources of bias when vaccination occurs after the beginning of an outbreak, such as during a pandemic. The model includes two covariates (health status and health awareness), which may affect the probabilities of vaccination, developing influenza and non-influenza acute respiratory illness (ARI), and seeking medical care. Specifically, we evaluate the bias of VE estimates when (1) vaccination affects the probability of developing a non-influenza ARI; (2) vaccination affects the probability of seeking medical care; (3) a covariate (e.g. health status) is related to both the probabilities of vaccination and developing an ARI; and (4) a covariate (e.g. health awareness) is related to both the probabilities of vaccination and of seeking medical care. We considered two outcomes against which the vaccine is supposed to protect: symptomatic influenza and medically-attended influenza. When vaccination begins during an outbreak, we found that the effect of delayed onset of vaccination is unpredictable. VE estimates from TN studies were biased regardless of the source of bias present. However, if the core assumption of the TN design is satisfied, that is, if vaccination does not affect the probability of non-influenza ARI, then TN-based VE estimates against medically-attended influenza will only suffer from small (<0.05) to moderate bias (≥0.05 and <0.10). These results suggest that if sources of bias listed above are ruled out, TN studies are a valid study design for the estimation of VE during a pandemic.",Inflammatory stress and altered angiogenesis evoked by very high-fat diets in mouse liver.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833154,"Endocrinologia, diabetes y nutricion",2019 03 05,"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), a condition that leads to fibrosis, is caused by intake of very high-fat diets (HFDs).

Previous reviews of the effectiveness of psychological interventions have focused on psychotic symptoms and general psychopathology, not recognising well-being as an essential outcome. This study conducted a meta-analysis of the effects of psychological interventions on the well-being and quality of life (QoL) of people with schizophrenia and analysed some critical moderating factors. A systematic literature search was conducted yielding 12986 published reports, 2043 of which were clinical trials. After a detailed review, 36 articles were included in the analyses. Measures of related concepts, well-being and quality of life were included in the present meta-analysis to reflect the current state of the literature and to ensure the representativeness of RCTs that have evaluated the effect of psychological interventions on the extent to which people with schizophrenia experience a good life. Our findings reflect a significant, small, treatment effect on the outcomes of well-being. Subgroup analysis also suggested a significant moderating effect when the primary aim of the intervention was well-being. These findings suggest that symptom or functional improvement does not necessarily lead to an improvement in well-being and would imply the need to focus specifically on those. We recommend psychological interventions that target well-being as a complementary strategy in mental health promotion and treatment. In addition, we stress the need to include well-being outcome measure in RCT as well as to clearly identify the different domains of well-being being measured.",Surgical outcome and efficacy of lumbar microdiscectomy technique with preserving of ligamentum flavum for recurrent lumbar disc herniations.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833132,Journal of clinical neuroscience : official journal of the Neurosurgical Society of Australasia,2019 06 07,"The reoperation for recurrent lumbar disc herniation (LDH) causes difficulties and low surgical outcome.

Multivariate analyses were performed for overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) through Monte Carlo methods and Maximum Likelihood Estimation. 57 articles detail results for 3022 patients. Meta-analysis revealed the following factors to have a statistically significant effect on OS. Patients undergoing gross-total resection (GTR) are 5.37 times more likely to survive than patients with lesser volumes of tumor resected (HR for OS 1.68, p < 0.01). High-grade tumors were associated with a 14 times risk of death over low-grade tumors (HR for OS 2.64, p < 0.01). Radiation increased the risk of mortality in low-grade tumors (HR for OS 5.20, p < 0.01), but decreased mortality in high-grade lesions (HR for OS 2.46, p < 0.01). Adult patients were more likely to die from disease compared with pediatric patients by a factor of 1.6 (HR for OS 0.47, p < 0.01). In PFS, radiotherapy was associated with a reduced time to recurrence (HR for PFS 1.90, p < 0.01). There was a male predominance of 58%. Gender did not influence survival. 79% of patients demonstrated stable or improved functional neurological outcomes six months post-operatively. Our data indicates GTR improves OS in all tumor grades. Radiation improves OS only in the presence of high-grade histology.

Many murine models are able to recapitulate the acute immune response to burn injury, yet few models are able to recapitulate long-term immune suppression and thus chronic susceptibility to bacterial infections seen in burn patients. This has hindered the field, making evaluation of the mechanisms responsible for these susceptibilities difficult to study. Herein we describe a novel mouse model of burn injury that promotes chronic immune suppression allowing for susceptibility to primary and secondary infections and thus allows for the evaluation of associated mechanisms.",Liposome-encapsulated farnesol accelerated tissue repair in third-degree burns on a rat model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833099,Burns : journal of the International Society for Burn Injuries,2019 06 14,"Third-degree or full-thickness burns refer to lesions that extend to the epidermis, dermis, and subcutaneous tissue. The pathophysiology of burn wounds is characterized by tissue inflammation, edema, and hypertrophic scarring. Farnesol is a natural 15-carbon organic compound that possesses many biological effects. We have previously demonstrated that farnesol gel exerts restorative actions on ultraviolet B (UVB)-caused sunburn in vivo. The in vitro results revealed that liposomal farnesol from 0.04mM to 0.8mM significantly enhanced collagen production by murine skin fibroblasts, whereas liposomal farnesol at high (0.8mM) and low concentration (0.04mM) did not show any suppressions on skin fibroblast proliferation. We treated third-degree burns on a rat model with a formulated gel composed of various ratios of 2% hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) and 4mM liposomal farnesol for 7 and 14 days. On days 7 and 14 post wounding, histopathological observations revealed that the HPMC:farnesol gel ratios of 1:2 and 2:1 exerted the greatest tissue-repairing effects on the skin after third-degree burns compared with skin untreated or treated with a commercial burn gel and HPMC alone. These findings were consistent with the in vivo quantitative collagen-producing assay, wound healing scoring, and IL-6 Western blot results. These findings demonstrated that the fabricated liposomal farnesol gel is potentially able to promote wound healing after third-degree burns.",An effective procedure for skin stiffness measurement to improve Paediatric Burn Care.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833098,Burns : journal of the International Society for Burn Injuries,2019 06 14,"The objective evaluation of scar quality plays a crucial role in improving burn surgery and scar rehabilitation.

Through different inoculation routes, MHV-A59 can provide animal models for encephalitis, hepatitis and pneumonia to explore viral life machinery and virus-host interactions. In viral replication, non-structural protein 5 (Nsp5), also termed main protease (Mpro), plays a dominant role in processing coronavirus-encoded polyproteins and is thus recognized as an ideal target of anti-coronavirus agents. However, no structure of the MHV-A59 Mpro has been reported, and molecular exploration of the catalysis mechanism remains hindered. Here, we solved the crystal structure of the MHV-A59 Mpro complexed with a Michael acceptor-based inhibitor, N3. Structural analysis revealed that the Cβ of the vinyl group of N3 covalently bound to C145 of the catalytic dyad of Mpro, which irreversibly inactivated cysteine protease activity. The lactam ring of the P1 side chain and the isobutyl group of the P2 side chain, which mimic the conserved residues at the same positions of the substrate, fit well into the S1 and S2 pockets. Through a comparative study with Mpro of other coronaviruses, we observed that the substrate-recognition pocket and enzyme inhibitory mechanism is highly conservative. Altogether, our study provided structural features of MHV-A59 Mpro and indicated that a Michael acceptor inhibitor is an ideal scaffold for antiviral drugs.",The study of the phiKZ phage non-canonical non-virion RNA polymerase.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833081,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2019 03 26,"Non-canonical multisubunit DNA-dependent RNA-polymerases (RNAP) form a new group of the main transcription enzymes, which have only distinct homology to the catalytic subunits of canonical RNAPs of bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. One of the rare non-canonical RNAP, which was partially biochemically characterized, is non-virion RNAP (nvRNAP) encoded by Pseudomonas phage phiKZ. PhiKZ nvRNAP consists of five subunits, four of which are homologs of β and β' subunit of bacterial RNAP, and the fifth subunits with unknown function. To understand the role of the fifth subunit in phiKZ nvRNAP, we created co-expression system allowing to get recombinant full five-subunit (5s) and four-subunit (4s) complexes and performed their comparison. The 5s recombinant complex is active on phage promoters in vitro as the native nvRNAP. The 4s complex cannot extend RNA, so 4s complex is not a catalytically active core of phiKZ nvRNAP. Thus, the phiKZ fifth subunit is not only a promoter-recognition subunit, but it plays an important role in the formation of active phiKZ nvRNAP.",Inhibited autophagy may contribute to heme toxicity in cardiomyoblast cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833080,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2019 03 26,"Several groups have demonstrated that induction of heme-oxygenase-1 (HO-1) could protect the myocardium against ischemic events; however, heme accumulation could lead to toxicity. The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of autophagy in heme toxicity. H9c2 cardiomyoblast cells were treated with different dose of hemin or cobalt-protoporphyrin IX (CoPPIX) or vehicle. Cell viability was measured by MTT assay. DCF and MitoSOX staining was employed to detect reactive oxygen species. Western blot analysis was performed to analyse the levels of HO-1, certain autophagy related proteins and pro-caspase-3 as an apoptosis marker. To study the autophagic flux, CytoID staining was carried out and cells were analyzed by fluorescence microscope and flow cytometry. Decreased cell viability was detected at high dose of hemin and CoPPIX treated H9c2 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, at concentration of the inducers used in the present study a significantly enhanced level of ROS were detected. As it was expected both treatments induced a robust elevation of HO-1 level. In addition, the Beclin-1- independent autophagy was significantly increased, but caused a defective autophagic flux with triggered activation of caspase-3. In conclusion, these results suggest that overexpression of HO-1 by high dose of hemin and CoPPIX can induce cell toxicity in H9c2 cells via enhanced ROS level and impaired autophagy.",Long non-coding RNA lnc-OAD is required for adipocyte differentiation in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833079,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2019 03 26,"Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have gained extensive attentions due to their significant roles in diverse biological process. However, the potential functions of lncRNAs participation in adipocyte differentiation have not been fully explored. Here we identified a long non-coding RNA called lnc-OAD (lncRNA associated with osteoblast and adipocyte differentiation, transcribed from 1700018A04Rik gene), which modulated 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation. Lnc-OAD was up-regulated expression during 3T3-L1 differentiation and stable knockdown of lnc-OAD inhibited adipocyte differentiation in 3T3-L1 cells. Further mechanisms study revealed that silencing of lnc-OAD strongly elevated the protein expression of β-catenin, and then decreased expression of adipocyte master transcription factors PPAR-γ and C/EBPα. The addition of IWR-1 up-regulated the expression of PPAR-γ and C/EBPα and rescued the impairment of adipocyte differentiation caused by lnc-OAD knockdown. Meanwhile, we also found mitotic clonal expansion (MCE) during the early stage of adipocyte differentiation was inhibited in lnc-OAD-knockdown cells. Taken together, our study reveals a novel function of lnc-OAD in modulating adipogenesis via influencing mitotic clonal expansion and regulating WNT/β-catenin signaling pathway.",TXNIP-mediated nuclear factor-κB signaling pathway and intracellular shifting of TXNIP in uric acid-induced NLRP3 inflammasome.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833078,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2019 03 26,The aim of this study was to assess the role of thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP) in nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling and the interaction between TXNIP and NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) in activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in monosodium urate (MSU)-induced inflammation.,Nicotine promotes the differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts and improves skeletal muscle regeneration in obese mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833077,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2019 03 26,"Nicotine is the main addictive substance in tobacco. It has been reported that nicotine can improve obesity and promote body weight loss in humans and rodents. In addition, obesity is associated with many chronic diseases. Many studies have demonstrated that the skeletal muscle regenerative capacity is impaired in obese mice. However, the effect of nicotine on skeletal muscle regeneration under obese conditions remains unclear. Thus, in the present study, we examined the effects of nicotine on the differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts in vitro and on skeletal muscle regeneration in obese mice in vivo. The results showed that nicotine promoted C2C12 myoblast differentiation by upregulating myogenic regulatory factors, including MyoD and Myogenin. Nicotine also activated the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, while blocking PI3K with the inhibitor LY294002 abrogated the effects of nicotine on the differentiation of C2C12 cells. Furthermore, nicotine was injected into the cardiotoxin (CTX)-injured skeletal muscles of obese mice. The results showed that the skeletal muscles injected with nicotine regenerated more quickly than the skeletal muscles injected with saline. Taken together, our data suggested that nicotine promoted the differentiation of C2C12 cells through activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway and rescued the impaired skeletal muscle regeneration in obese mice.",Arginine vasopressin attenuates the effects of TNF-α in aortic endothelial cells by inducing ectodomain shedding of TNF receptor 1.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833075,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2019 03 26,"In septic shock, arginine vasopressin (AVP) is commonly used as a vasopressor to restore blood pressure. Exogenous AVP may have anti-inflammatory effects as well. We investigated whether AVP modulates the effects of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs). TNF-α stimulated intercellular adhesion molecule-1 expression, while AVP pretreatment attenuated this effect of TNF-α. Upon treatment with AVP, extracellular Ca2+ entered the cells rapidly through L-type calcium channels, which in turn induced cell surface translocation of a disintegrin and metalloprotease 10 (ADAM10) and ectodomain shedding of tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1). On the other hand, siRNA depletion of ADAM10 suppressed AVP-induced ectodomain shedding of TNFR1 and eliminated the inhibitory effect of AVP against TNF-α. Depletion of oxytocin receptor also abolished AVP-induced extracellular Ca2+ influx, AVP-induced ectodomain shedding of TNFR1 and the inhibitory effect of AVP against TNF-α. These findings suggest that AVP decreases the responsiveness of HAECs to TNF-α by inducing ADAM10-dependent ectodomain shedding of TNFR1. Extracellular Ca2+ influx through L-type calcium channels was essential for ADAM10 activation. This effect of AVP was mediated through the oxytocin receptor.",SOX9 is controlled by the BRD4 inhibitor JQ1 via multiple regulation mechanisms.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833074,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2019 03 26,"SOX9 is a key transcription factor during cell differentiation, sex determination, and tumorigenesis. However, the detailed mechanisms of its targeting strategy remain elusive. To investigate possibilities of targeting SOX9 with epigenetic drugs and the precise underlying mechanisms, two human cancer cell lines were chosen as model systems, which showed high SOX9 expression and anti-tumorigenic effects upon loss of SOX9. Histone acetylation-related screening of a small panel of epigenetic drugs revealed that the bromodomain reader inhibitor JQ1 dramatically downregulated SOX9 through multiple regulation steps, namely, transcription, BRD4-SOX9 protein-protein interaction, and further protein stability. These findings suggest that BRD4 inhibition is a novel therapeutic strategy for diseases characterized by SOX9 overexpression.",Role for tyrosine phosphorylation of SUV39H1 histone methyltransferase in enhanced trimethylation of histone H3K9 via neuregulin-1/ErbB4 nuclear signaling.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833073,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2019 03 26,"Protein-tyrosine kinases transmit signals by phosphorylating their substrates in diverse cellular events. The receptor-type tyrosine kinase ErbB4, a member of the epidermal growth factor receptor subfamily, is activated and proteolytically cleaved upon ligand stimulation, and the cleaved ErbB4 intracellular domain (4ICD) is released into the cytoplasm and the nucleus. We previously showed that generation of nuclear 4ICD by neuregulin-1 (NRG-1) stimulation enhances the levels of trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 9 (H3K9me3). However, it remains unclear how nuclear 4ICD enhances H3K9me3 levels. Here we show that the histone H3K9 methyltransferase SUV39H1 associates with NRG-1/ErbB4-mediated H3K9me3. Knockdown of SUV39H1 blocked NRG-1-mediated enhancement of the levels of H3K9me3. Nuclear 4ICD was found to phosphorylate SUV39H1 primarily at Tyr-297, -303, and -308 that are conserved among humans, mice, and flies. Furthermore, knockdown-rescue experiments showed that the unphosphorylatable SUV39H1 mutant (3 YF) was incapable of enhancing the levels of H3K9me3 upon NRG-1 stimulation. These results suggest that nuclear ErbB4 enhances H3K9me3 levels through tyrosine phosphorylation of SUV39H1 in NRG-1/ErbB4 signal-mediated chromatin remodeling."

Vascular access failure patients have multiple comorbidities and a higher risk of cardiovascular and thrombotic events. Thus, it is presumed that graft and patient survivals might be worse for these patients. The aim of this paper was to analyze the characteristics and outcomes of HU-RT patients due to access failure for renal replacement therapy when comparing them to a population of deceased-donor renal transplant (DDRT) patients. We analyzed data from our Renal Transplantation Unit from January 2006 to April 2017. In this period, 374 patients had a renal transplant. Of these, 11 patients received a high-urgency deceased-donor renal transplant (HU-DDRT). Compared with patients who had a DDRT, HU-DDRT patients were predominantly female (54.5% vs 43.5%, P = .007) and younger (41.6 ± 7.9 vs 49.4 ± 11.8, P = .031). HU-DDRT patients were not significantly more sensitized than DDRT (14.1 ± 27.4 vs 13.5 ± 24.1, P = .935), and had a comparable number of HLA mismatches (3.4 ± 1.4 vs 3.6 ± 1.2, P = .343). Despite the higher incidence in hypertensive (90.9 vs 73.5%, P = .196) and diabetic patients (27.3% vs 15.7%, P = .305) in the HU-DDRT group, this difference was not statistically significant. The percentage of retransplantation was similar in both groups (9.1% vs 7.2%, P = .808). Donor sex, age, and baseline serum creatinine were similar between the groups. There was an increased proportion of expanded criteria donors in HU-DDRT (54.5% vs 25.1%, P = .028). There were no differences in cold or warm ischemia time nor in serum creatinine at discharge or during the first 2 years of follow-up. In both groups, a similar proportion of patients experienced acute rejection episodes. Comparable to DDRT patients, HU-DDRT patients had a high proportion of graft survival at the 1-year follow-up (90.9% vs 93.1%, P = .777). At a 2-year follow-up, graft survival was lower in the HU-DDRT group (81.8% vs 91.5%, P = .267). Mean follow-up for both groups was comparable (78.5 ± 46.7 vs 68.4 ± 40.8 months, P = .424). Overall, graft loss occurred in approximately 36.4% of HU-DDRT patients and 20.9% of DDRT patients (P = .219). Both groups had an overall mortality rate of around 9%. The differences were not statistically significant due to the limited number of patients. More comorbidities and reportedly worse cardiovascular prognosis of access failure (AF) patients and use of expanded criteria donors did not negatively reflect in worse short-term outcomes in our cohort, which highlights the importance of HU-RT in prolonging the survival of AF patients.",Hollow silica microspheres as robust immobilization carriers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833027,Bioorganic chemistry,2019 03 05,"Hollow silica microspheres provide an ideal solid support for enzyme immobilization. We tested one of the newest development, namely MATSPHERES®, a silica openwork material as a carrier for the covalent immobilization of enzymes used to synthesize bioactive compounds. Two model enzymes - ethylbenzene dehydrogenase and EL070 lipase - were considered. They belong to two different enzyme classes and catalyse reactions taking place in various environments (aqueous and non-aqueous, aerobic and anaerobic). The enzymes were immobilized by covalent bonds (via divinyl sulfone and glutaraldehyde) on new silica material. Effectiveness of immobilization processes on the spheres grafted with amine groups and on the analogues without functionalization was determined for both enzymes. Microspheres were characterized morphologically and also their mechanical stability was examined during exposure to varying physical conditions. It was shown that MATSPHERES® due to their openwork structure and relative stability under batch and flow conditions can be a competitive SBA support for enzyme immobilization and production of bioactive compounds.",Revelation of the metabolic pathway of hederacoside C using an innovative data analysis strategy for dynamic multiclass biotransformation experiments.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833026,Journal of chromatography. A,2019 05 04,"Although some herbal remedies have been used for decades, little is known about the active compounds and the mechanism of action. Many natural products, such as glycosides, can be considered as prodrugs, which become active after biotransformation. To optimize the workflow of in vitro biotransformation followed by automated data analysis, hederacoside C was used as a model compound for saponins. Hederacoside C was subjected to gastrointestinal enzymes and fecal microflora. Samples were analyzed with UHPLC-PDA-HRMS before, during and after in vitro biotransformation, which allowed the monitoring of the relative abundances of the compound and its metabolites. The data-analysis workflow was optimized to render as much information as possible from the longitudinal LCMS data. XCMS was used to convert the raw data into features via peak-picking, followed by grouping, and EDGE was used for the extraction of significant differential profiles. To evaluate if the workflow was suitable for dynamic multiclass metabolomics data, an interactive Shiny web app was developed in R to rate the quality of the resulting features. These ratings were used to train a random forest model for predicting experts response. A performance analysis revealed that the random forest model was capable of correctly predicting the reviewers response in most cases (AUC 0.926 with 10 fold cross validation). The automated data analysis workflow was used for unbiased screening for metabolites and revealed the biotransformation of hederacoside C. As expected, a decrease in relative abundance of hederacoside C was observed over time. Additionally, the relative abundance of metabolites increased, illustrating the biotransformation of hederacoside C, especially in the colon phase, where microbial fermentation takes place. Stepwise progressive elimination of sugar moieties was the major metabolic pathway.",Benchmarking machine learning methods for comprehensive chemical fingerprinting and pattern recognition.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833025,Journal of chromatography. A,2019 05 04,"Machine learning (ML) has been used previously to recognize particular patterns of constituent compounds. Here, ML is used with comprehensive chemical fingerprints that capture the distribution of all constituent compounds to flexibly perform various pattern recognition tasks. Such pattern recognition requires a sequence of chemical analysis, data analysis, and pattern analysis. Chemical analysis with comprehensive multidimensional chromatography is a maturing approach for highly effective separations of complex samples and so provides a solid foundation for undertaking comprehensive chemical fingerprinting. Data analysis with smart templates employs marker peaks and chemical logic for chromatographic alignment and peak-regions to delineate chromatographic windows in which analytes are quantified and matched consistently across chromatograms to create chemical profiles that serve as complete fingerprints. Pattern analysis uses ML techniques with the resulting fingerprints to recognize sample characteristics, e.g., for classification. Our experiments evaluated the effectiveness of seventeen different ML techniques for various classification problems with chemical fingerprints from a rich data set from 126 wine samples of different varieties, geographic regions, vintages, and wineries. Results of these experiments showed an accuracy range from 58% to 88% for different ML methods on the most difficult classification problems and 96% to 100% for different ML methods on the least difficult classification problems. Averaged over 14 classification problems, accuracy for the different methods ranged from 80% to 90%, with some relatively simple ML techniques among the top-performing methods.",Molar mass distributions of linear homopolymers by size exclusion chromatography with light scattering detection: A method for automatic band broadening correction.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833024,Journal of chromatography. A,2019 05 04,"Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) equipped with a differential refractometer (DR) and a light scattering (LS) detector is a well-known technique for determining the molar mass distribution (MMD) of many polymers. In the case of narrow polymers, correction of the band broadening (BB) effect is necessary; but unfortunately, the available BB correction methods are rather impractical for most SEC users. This work proposes an automatic BB correction method for determining the MMD of narrow linear homopolymers (or multimodal homopolymers that include narrow modes) on the basis of SEC/(DR + LS) measurements. The required data are: the baseline-corrected DR and LS chromatograms, the inter-detector volume (IDV), and a molar mass calibration independently determined from narrow standards. In comparison to other available alternatives for BB correction, the here-proposed method has the following key advantages: a) no previous knowledge on the BB function is required; b) the detectors gain constants are unnecessary; and c) no numerical regularization method is required. Moreover, if the IDV is unknown, then the proposed method could also be used for estimating the IDV from the knowledge of the dispersity index of a narrow homopolymer. The proposal was experimentally assessed by analyzing narrow standards of poly(styrene) and poly(methyl-methacrylate). The proposed method estimated the dispersity indexes of the standards with errors lower than 0.9% with respect to values reported by manufacturers (between 1.015 and 1.044); while the classical approaches based on SEC/DR and SEC/(DR + LS), produced errors of up to -11% and 3%, respectively.",The binding affinity of uncharged aromatic solutes for negatively charged resins is enhanced by cations via cation-π interactions: The case of sodium ion and arginine.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833023,Journal of chromatography. A,2019 05 04,"Salt solutions are widely used as eluents for ion-exchange chromatography. In general, salts reduce the retention of applied solutes on ion-exchange columns via electrostatic screening effects. The reverse phenomenon, namely, salt-enhanced retention, has not been reported. Here, we report that cations, including arginine, guanidine and sodium ions, enhance the retention of uncharged aromatic solutes on a cation-exchange resin, i.e., a negatively charged resin, with carboxyl groups, where we used alkyl gallates as model uncharged aromatic solutes and a carboxymethyl agarose gel (CM Sepharose) as a model negatively charged resin. Enhancement of retention was observed at concentrations of tens of millimolar of the salts, in which arginine hydrochloride was more effective than guanidinium salts and NaCl. Similar trends were observed for other phenolic compounds, including phenol and 4-hydroxybenzyl alcohol. Molecular dynamics simulations showed that the binding free energy between the alkyl gallate molecule and the CM Sepharose resin ligand molecule increased with increasing salt concentration. The increase in binding free energy caused by the salts was accounted for by the binding of the salt cations to the aromatic moiety of the alkyl gallate via cation-π interactions, leading to attenuation of intrinsic repulsive interactions between the ligand carboxyl group and the alkyl gallate aromatic moiety. Therefore, the salt-enhanced retention of the uncharged aromatic solutes on the negatively charged resins was ascribable to the increase in binding free energy induced by the cation-π interactions.

While accumulating research has elucidated the neural processing of native morphology, much less is known about how second-language (L2) learners acquire and process morphology in their L2. To address this question, we presented native speakers as well as beginning and advanced learners of Finnish with spoken (1) derived words, (2) inflected words, (3) novel derivations (novel combinations of existing stem + suffix), and (4) pseudo-suffixed words (existing stem + pseudo-suffix) in a passive listening EEG experiment. An early (60 msec after suffix deviation point) positive ERP response showed no difference between inflections and derivations, suggesting similar early parsing of these complex words. At 130 msec, derivations elicited a lexical ERP pattern of full-form memory-trace activation, present in the L2 beginners and advanced speakers to different degrees, implying a shift from lexical processing to more dual parsing and lexical activation of the complex forms with increasing proficiency. Pseudo-suffixed words produced a syntactic pattern in a later, 170-240 msec time-window, exhibiting enhanced ERPs compared to well-formed inflections, indicating second-pass syntactic parsing. Overall, the L2 learners demonstrated a gradual effect of proficiency towards L1-like responses. Advanced L2 learners seem to have developed memory traces for derivations and their neurolinguistic system is capable of early automatic parsing. This suggests that advanced learners have already developed sensitivity to morphological information, while such knowledge is weak in beginners. Discrepancies in ERP dynamics and topographies indicate partially differing recruitment of the language network in L1 and L2. In beginners, response differences between existing and novel morphology were scarce, implying that representations for complex forms are not yet well-established. The results suggest successful development of brain mechanisms for automatic processing of L2 morphology, capable of gradually attaining L1-like functionality with increasing proficiency.",Measuring mental time travel: Is the hippocampus really critical for episodic memory and episodic foresight?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30832993,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,2019 03 05,"Mental time travel is an adaptive capacity that enables humans to engage in deliberate, prudent action on the basis of remembering past episodes (episodic memory) and simulating future scenarios (episodic foresight). This capacity has become a popular and rapidly growing topic of interdisciplinary research. Perhaps the most influential and frequently tested neuroscientific hypothesis in this domain is that the hippocampus is a hub in a critical neural network for mental time travel, support for which is now commonly assumed by most researchers in the area. In light of recent findings revealing limitations with existing measures of episodic foresight, we critically evaluate the available evidence for this hypothesis and find that it is inconclusive. We suggest that this is due in significant part to the exclusive and widespread reliance on noisy verbal measures and discuss this case as an example of a more general issue pertaining to the measurement of episodic foresight. Accordingly, we suggest that an essential focus of future research should concern the development of objective measures that capture capacity differences by requiring people to put foresight not just into words, but into action.",Lung nodules are reliably detectable on ultra-low-dose CT utilising model-based iterative reconstruction with radiation equivalent to plain radiography.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30832990,Clinical radiology,2019 04 12,To determine if ultra-low-dose (ULD) computed tomography (CT) utilising model-based iterative reconstruction (MBIR) with radiation equivalent to plain radiography allows the detection of lung nodules.,Utilisation of contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography in the assessment of deep inferior epigastric artery perforator flap for breast reconstruction surgery.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30832989,Clinical radiology,2019 05 04,To identify and characterise the ideal-sized (defined as at least 2.7 mm based on the experience of plastic surgeons at Hull Royal Infirmary) perforators using magnetic resonance angiography (MRA).

An adaptive bounded neural network controller is proposed to mitigate the malicious effect of the cyber-attack. At first, an individual path-following control law is designed for each vehicle by fusing a back-stepping technique, a line-of-sight guidance principle and a predictor-based neural network method. Second, a path update law is developed based on a synchronization approach together with an adaptive control method. The salient features of the proposed controller are presented as follows. First, an adaptive corrective signal is incorporated into the path update law design such that a desired formation can be achieved regardless of the time-varying state-dependent cyber-attack. Second, by using a saturation function and a projection operator, the proposed controller is bounded and the bound is known as a priori. It is proven that the closed-loop system is input-to-state practical stable in the face of time-varying state-dependent cyber-attack. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed adaptive bounded neural network controller for coordinated path-following of networked underactuated autonomous surface vehicles subject to the cyber-attack.",Mechanism analysis and suppression strategy research on permanent magnet synchronous generator wind turbine torsional vibration.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30832987,ISA transactions,2019 03 05,"Torsional vibration of flexible drive chain is a historical issue. With the maximization development and the rotating machinery high-speed operation, the drive chain systems of large-scaled units become more and more complex, which makes the torsional vibration problems becoming increasingly prominent in recent years. This article deeply analyzed the small signal stability of large-scaled WECS based on CMT, elaborated the torsional vibration mechanism and reasons for the first time and pointed out torsional vibration is caused by the disturbance wind and the DPC strategy. The disturbance wind is an external stimulus and can produce a low-frequency torsional vibration at the same frequency as wind speed. The DPC could weaken the drive chain damping. If the total damping of drive chain is negative, the unstable torsion vibration will occur. And if the drive chain is still a under-damped dynamic, the high-frequency torsional vibration at natural frequency will be generated. Therefore, large-scaled WECS must have damping control. This study found that appropriate enhancing drive chain stiffness could reduce low-frequency torsional vibration caused by wind speed. Therefore, a damping and stiffness compensation control method was proposed to suppress the torsional vibration. Compared with the conventional damping control, the new method not only can suppress the high-frequency torsional vibration but also has a good restraining effect on the low-frequency torsional vibration. Furthermore, the detailed design procedures including the calculation of injection damping and stiffness were given in this paper. Finally, the correctness and effectiveness of our analysis were further verified by the simulation experiments."

Inverse probability weighting based on propensity score was employed to balance the ranolazine and traditional antianginals cohorts on patient clinical characteristics. Outcomes assessed were frequency and total cost of revascularization procedures over a 12-month follow-up. A total of 108,741 patients with SIHD were included. Of these, 18% initiated treatment with ranolazine, 21% received BBs, 24% received CCBs, and 37% were treated with LANs. Revascularization rates were significantly lower in ranolazine patients (11%) than in BB (16%) and LAN (14%) patients (both p <0.001), and more comparable to CCB patients (10%; p = 0.007). Compared with BB and LAN, those in the ranolazine cohort were less likely to have a revascularization procedure during hospitalization and had a shorter length of stay if hospitalized (all p <0.001).

However, the acquired datasets do not have the same sampling dimension. For example, the airborne measurements are some sort of averaging over a circular field of view, beneath the sensor; while the soil analyses are much more punctual. The objective of this work is to compare the soil samples and an airborne survey to investigate whether these two datasets reflect the same spatial patterns or not. This is prerequisite for combining the multiresolution data to create and update the contamination map in a post-accidental situation. The analyses were performed on square tiles of 20 km side to study large- and small-dimension variations in 137Cs deposition. The former was modelled by fitting a plane (called trend) to the georeferenced data points; and the latter was modelled by computing the difference (called residual) between the trend and the initial data. Dip direction and dip angle of trends as well as minimum spatial correlation distance and anisotropy of residuals were computed for both the soil and airborne datasets and compared. Dip directions are compatible in 73% of the tiles and dip angles are generally close. Anisotropy directions are compatible in 49% of the tiles and minimum spatial correlation distances are significantly more marked for the airborne dataset. The soil samples and airborne measurements are therefore more in agreement in large-dimension (trend) rather than in small-dimension (residual) variations. More generally, both the datasets allow highlighting the main contamination plumes distinguishable because of high concentration values. The airborne dataset yet appears to be more powerful to quantify spatial correlations, which could be linked to the contamination mechanisms.",Where Do We Go from Here?

LGB aging and the (im)possibilities of coming out to others.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30832935,Journal of aging studies,2019 05 28,"Middle and older age are usually ignored in the studies of the processes of coming out. This paper analyses the opportunities, and also the barriers which aging brings to the possibility of articulating one's own sexual identity in relation to others. It presents the life-course perspective as a suitable analytical tool for the study of the impact of historical context and the changing social locations within the life-biography. Analysis presented in this paper is based on 19 in-depth interviews with LGB people aged fifty and older living in the Czech Republic. The paper focuses on the way they relate to the idea of coming out and how they reflect on their previous biography with respect to the possibilities to articulate their sexuality in various phases of their life. It analyses how aging creates possibilities as well as barriers to articulate sexual identity with respect to family and closed ones and points out the need to critically reflect the narratives of coming out as a linear process of leaving ""the closet"". Older age was by the participants depicted as an important context that disrupted some of the barriers preventing coming out to others. However, the vision of late old age linked with specific age-related contexts (such as life in residential care facilities) was associated with impossibility to express sexual identity.",Expanding current understandings of epistemic injustice and dementia: Learning from stigma theory.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30832933,Journal of aging studies,2019 05 28,"The current paper addresses the nature of epistemic injustice as it may be experienced by persons with dementia. We describe how theoretical models of stigma align with the current model of epistemic injustice through a consideration of the concepts of 'stereotype', 'prejudice' and 'discrimination', shared by the two models. We draw on current understandings of dementia-related stigma to expand understandings of the epistemic injustice faced by persons with dementia. We discuss how these insights may inform the development of mechanisms to uphold the basic human right to speak, to be heard, and to be believed for persons with dementia."

It was discovered that onion-like hollow QG, which consists of multi-layer graphene and different carbon allotropes having a high proportion of folded edges and surface defects, could endow the scaffolded COFs with enhanced green fluorescence and environmental stability. Unexpectedly, they could exhibit the powerful absorption for Cu2+ ions resulting in the specific quenching of fluorescence. A fluorimetric strategy with QG-scaffolded COFs was thereby developed to probe Cu2+ ions separately in blood and wastewater with the linear concentration ranges of 0.0010-10.0 μM (limit of detection of 0.50 nM) and 0.0032-32.0 μM (limit of detection of 2.4 nM), respectively, promising the potential applications for the field-applicable monitoring of Cu2+ ions in the clinical and environmental analysis fields. In addition, the prepared COFs sorbents were employed to absorb Cu2+ ions in wastewater showing high removal efficiency. More importantly, such an one-pot fabrication route with hollow QG scaffolds may be tailorable extensively for the preparation of a variety of metal-free multifunctional COFs with enhanced fluorescence, water solubility, environmental stability, and metal removal capability.",Combining diffusive gradients in thin films (DGT) and spectroscopic techniques for the determination of phosphorus species in soils.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30832921,Analytica chimica acta,2019 03 05,"A wide range of methods are used to estimate the plant-availability of soil phosphorus (P). Published research has shown that the diffusive gradients in thin films (DGT) technique has a superior correlation to plant-available P in soils compared to standard chemical extraction tests. In order to identify the plant-available soil P species, we combined DGT with infrared and P K- and L2,3-edge X-ray adsorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy. This was achieved by spectroscopically investigating the dried binding layer of DGT devices after soil deployment. All three spectroscopic methods were able to distinguish between different kinds of phosphates (poly-, trimeta-, pyro- and orthophosphate) on the DGT binding layer. However, infrared spectroscopy was most sensitive to distinguish between different types of adsorbed inorganic and organic phosphates. Furthermore, intermediates of the time-resolved hydrolysis of trimetaphosphate in soil could be analyzed.",Simultaneous determination of multiple components in cigarettes by mechanochemical extraction and direct analysis in real time mass spectrometry in minutes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30832920,Analytica chimica acta,2019 03 19,"A simple, rapid and high throughput analytical approach with combination of mechanochemical extraction (MCE) and direct analysis in real time mass spectrometry (DART-MS) analysis was developed for the simultaneous determination of multiple chemical components in cigarette fillers. Different kinds of substances including nicotine, cigarette alkaloids, carbohydrates, organic acids, humectants and other additives were successfully extracted using MCE and detected by high resolution DART-MS. Six solvents of various polarities were compared during MCE process and significant differences were observed. Different brands of cigarettes as well as standard research cigarette exhibited distinctive chemical features and DART-MS fingerprints. Principle component analysis showed clear differentiation among different cigarettes extracted with the same solvent and different solvent extracts of the same type of cigarette. The putative chemical formulas were proposed based on accurate m/z values with <10 ppm mass errors. The relative contents of nicotine and other identified substances were compared and significant differences were observed among cigarettes of different locations. The whole procedure of MCE combined with DART-MS only takes minutes from raw cigarette fillers to obtaining the semi-quantitative results. The operation is simple and high throughput, providing an efficient method to analyze cigarette composition, and to establish a methodology to acquire the rapid cigarette fingerprints for quality control.",Modeling the fragmentation patterns of triacylglycerides in mass spectrometry allows the quantification of the regioisomers with a minimal number of standards.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30832919,Analytica chimica acta,2019 03 19,"Mass spectrometry allows the relative quantification of the regioisomers of triacylglycerides by the calibration of their fragmentation patterns. However, due to the plethora of regioisomers of triacylglycerides, calibration with every standard is not feasible. An analytical challenge in the field is the prediction of the fragmentation patterns of triacylglycerides to quantify their regioisomers. Thus, we aimed to model these fragmentation patterns to quantify the regioisomeric composition, even for those without commercially available standards. In a first step, we modeled the fragmentation patterns of the regioisomers of triacylglycerides obtained from different published datasets. We found the same qualitative trends of fragmentation beyond differences in the type of adduct in these datasets (both [M+NH4]+ and [M+H]+), and the type of instrument (orbitrap, Q-ToF, ion-trap, single quadrupole, and triple quadrupole). However, the quantitative trends of fragmentation were adduct and instrument specific. From these observations, we modeled quantitatively the common trends of fragmentation of triacylglycerides in every dataset. In a second step, we applied this methodology on a Synapt G2S Q-ToF to quantify the regioisomers of triacylglycerides in sunflower and olive oils. The results of our quantification were in good agreement with previous published quantifications of triacylglycerides, even for regioisomers that were not present in the training dataset. The species with more than two highly unsaturated fatty acids (arachidonic, eicosapentaenoic, and docosahexaenoic acids) showed a complex behavior and lower predictability of their fragmentation patterns. However, this framework presents the capacity to model this behavior when more data are available. It would be also applicable to standardize the quantification of the regioisomers of triacylglycerides in an inter-laboratory ring study.","Spectrophotometric, fluorimetric and electrochemical selective pyrophosphate/ATP sensing based on the dimethyltin(IV)-tiron system.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30832918,Analytica chimica acta,2019 03 19,"Sensing of pyrophosphate anion (PPi) in the presence of nucleotide triphosphates allows the real time monitoring of the polymerase chain reaction. To get a deeper understanding of the factors involved in PPi/nucleotide triphosphate discrimination, a detailed study on the performance of a dimethyltin (IV)-catecholate complex capable of both separate fluorimetric or electrochemical detection of PPi in the presence of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) has been undertaken. Dimethyltin (IV) tightly binds PPi or ATP, and forms a stable 1:1 complex with tiron (4,5-dihydroxy-1,3-benzenedisulfonic acid) in water. The complexation equilibria with all components are characterized quantitatively by potentiometric and spectroscopic titrations. Pyrophosphate anion can be detected owing to its ability to release free tiron from the complex by measuring either a fluorimetric or an electrochemical signal. On the contrary, ATP does not displace tiron but causes an interference with PPi in the fluorimetric detection method due to the formation of a ternary Me2Sn(IV)-tiron-ATP complex with optical properties intermediate between those of free and bound tiron. In the electrochemical (square wave voltammetry) method, the ternary ATP complex shows a separate peak which does not coincide with the peaks of neither free nor bound tiron, thus making possible the simultaneous detection of ATP in addition to PPi.",CdTe@SiO2 signal reporters-based fluorescent immunosensor for quantitative detection of prostate specific antigen.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30832917,Analytica chimica acta,2019 03 19,"In this paper, an immunosensor using CdTe@SiO2 core-shell nanoparticles as labels was constructed for highly sensitive detection of prostate-specific antigen (PSA). In this approach, CdTe@SiO2 core-shell nanoparticles were synthesized using the sol-gel method. The additional Cd ions and sulfur source in SiO2 shell can greatly enhance the fluorescence intensity of CdTe nanocrystals. The reason is the formation of CdS-like cluster in SiO2 shell, which reduced the quantum size effect. The obtained CdTe@SiO2 nanoparticles also exhibited excellent biocompatibility, which was ideal for applying in biomarker detection. Furthermore, PSA capture antibodies functionalized magnetic Fe3O4 nanoparticles (Fe3O4-Ab1) were utilized in the proposed immunosensor to capture and enrich the PSA. The captured PSA was then immuno-recognized by CdTe@SiO2 labeled with PSA detection antibodies (CdTe@SiO2-Ab2) by forming the sandwich complex Fe3O4-Ab1/PSA/Ab2-CdTe@SiO2. The construction of this immunosensor was confirmed by fluorescence spectroscopy. The proposed immunosensor showed a good linear relationship between the fluorescent intensity and the target PSA concentration ranging from 0.01 to 5 ng/mL, and a detection limit as low as 0.003 ng/mL was achieved. The sensor also exhibited good specificity to PSA.

The activity and inhibition of CPB are significant for peptide sequencing and protein engineering. In this paper, a sensitive and easily-prepared nanochannel system was used to detect the activity of CPB. We assembled the peptides composing of alkaline amino acids into the nanochannels to detect the activity of CPB based on its hydrolysis characteristic. With CPB, the peptides would be cleaved, causing less blocking-effect on the ionic current through nanochannels. This system exhibited high sensitivity (detection limit of 0.01 U mL-1), wide linear range (0.01-10 U mL-1), and fast response (less than 10 s) for specific CPB detection. We also used the system to detect the effect of CPB inhibitors and detect in complex actual samples.

The selectivity of single separation techniques such as gas chromatography (GC), liquid chromatography (LC), or capillary electrophoresis (CE) with common detection principles can be enhanced by hyphenating orthogonal separation techniques but also by using complementary detection systems. In this review, two-dimensional systems containing CE in at least one dimension are reviewed, namely LC-CE or 2D CE systems. Particular attention is paid to the aspect of selectivity enhancement due to the orthogonality of the different separation mechanisms. As an alternative concept, dual detection approaches are reviewed using the common detectors of CE such as UV/VIS, laser-induced fluorescence, capacitively coupled contactless conductivity (C4D), electrochemical detection, and mass spectrometry. Special emphasis is given to dual detection systems implementing the highly flexible C4D as one detection component. Selectivity enhancement can be achieved in case of complementarity of the different detection techniques.",Modulation of the electroosmotic mobility using polyelectrolyte multilayer coatings for protein analysis by capillary electrophoresis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30832914,Analytica chimica acta,2019 03 19,"Successive multiple ionic-polymer layers (SMIL) coatings have been often used in capillary electrophoresis due to their simplicity to implement and regenerate. However, the performances of the separation are strongly dependent on the nature of the polyelectrolyte partners used to build the SMIL coating. In this work, we investigate new couples of polyelectrolytes that were not tested before: namely, polybrene (PB), quaternized diethylaminoethyl dextran (DEAEDq) and ε-poly(lysine) (ε-PLL), as polycations, in combination with poly(acrylic acid), dextran sulfate, poly(styrenesulfonate), poly(methacrylic acid) and poly(l-lysine citramide), as polyanions. Systematic study of intra- and inter-capillaries repeatabilities/reproducibilities was performed based on the determination of migration time, separation efficiency and electroosmotic mobility. Interestingly, the electroosmotic flow was found to vary with the nature of the polycation on a broad range of electroosmotic mobility decreasing in magnitude in the order of PB>ε-PLL > DEAEDq, whatever the polyanion associated. Application of the coatings to the separation of proteins is illustrated in a 0.5 M acetic acid BGE, including CE-MS separation of ribonuclease B-glycoforms of the same mass (positional or structural isomers).",Facile synthesis of layered mesoporous covalent organic polymers for highly selective enrichment of N-glycopeptides.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30832913,Analytica chimica acta,2019 03 19,"Hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography is a significant strategy for the separation and enrichment of glycoproteins and glycopeptides.

Then p-TpBDH-OH with abundant hydrophilic groups was evolved from p-TpBDH by the direct reduction. 36 and 40 glycopeptides were identified from IgG digests respectively by p-TpBDH and p-TpBDH-OH. Furthermore, the p-TpBDH-OH exhibits superior selectivity (IgG: BSA = 1: 250) for glycopeptides compared with the p-TpBDH. Encouragingly, a total of 463 glycopeptides assigned to 173 glycoproteins were finally identified from only 2 μL human serum by the p-TpBDH-OH. Compared with p-TpBDH, abundant hydrophilic and nitrogen-containing affinity sites of p-TpBDH-OH facilitate effective hydrophilic interaction between the polymeric material and glycopeptides. All the results demonstrate the functionalized hydrophilic covalent organic polymer has great potential in large-scale N-glycoproteomic research."

Structural analysis indicated that TSP-1 and TSP-2 consisted of Manp, GlcpA, Glcp, Galp, Xylp and Araf with different molar ratios. Methylation and NMR analysis revealed that the backbone of TSP-1 might consist of 1,6-linked-Glcp, 1,3,6-linked-Manp and 1,6-linked-Galp, while TSP-2 was mainly composed of 1,3,5-linked-Araf, 1,6-linked-Glcp, 1,4-linked-Xylp and 1,6-linked-Galp. Congo red assay indicated that TSP-1 and TSP-2 had no triple-helix structure, which was consistent with the results of AFM. In vivo hepatoprotective activity showed that TSP-1 and TSP-2 could improve CCl4-induced mice liver injury by reducing the activities of AST, ALT and the level of MDA, increasing the activities of SOD, GSH-Px, and CAT and the level of GSH in liver and decreasing the expression levels of TNF-α and IL-6 in liver.

Composite brings additional properties while reinforcing the substrate. In the study, printable PU composites were successfully prepared by introducing cellulose nanofibrils (CNFs) and the viscosity was effectively regulated by the amount of neutralizing agent during in-situ synthesis. Rheological measurements supported the good printability. TEM images revealed that CNFs linked multiple PU nanoparticles to form a 'skewer' structure. PU/CNF scaffolds were 3D-printed with excellent pattern fidelity and structure stability. Meanwhile, the compression modulus was much higher than the scaffolds printed with a water-soluble viscosity enhancer (PEO). Fibroblasts kept proliferating in the scaffolds for two weeks.

To produce PADC-Fe3+ polymer with different CNF contents, CNF loadings of 5-20% were explored. The UV-spectroscopy analysis demonstrated the occurrence of CNF coalescence and optimized that 10% CNF loading resulted in the production of PADC-0.1-Fe3+ with the highest absorbance. Compared to copolymers (PAD or PADC-0.1) prepared without CNF or Fe3+, the synthesized PADC-0.1-Fe3+ showed much better tolerance to salt, high temperature, and shear.

The gel strength of CPGs increased and the morphology structure became denser with the increase of monovalent cations and pectin concentration. It was also found that Na+ induced stronger gels as compared to those induce by K+, at the same alkaline and pectin condition.

In this investigation, cellulose fibers were successfully extracted from Thespesia populnea tree barks of approximately 10 mm-80 mm diameter stem and the influence of stem growth on physiochemical, thermal, mechanical and morphological characteristics of the fiber were investigated. The diameter of fiber increased from 150 μm to 200 μm with stem growth meanwhile its water uptake capability decreases by 13.8%. FTIR spectra and thermal analysis confirm the presence of cellulose compound in fiber structure, also the fiber can be stable up to 318 °C. The XRD outcome estimates 44-49% crystallinity index with an average crystallite size of 29.625 Å. Under the tensile load, fiber fails primarily by brittle fracture and its tensile strength ranges from 559 MPa to 329 MPa with an average elongation between 2.9% and 1.7%.

Targeting the lower section of the intestine is the main aim of therapy because it is the compartment primarily affected by IBDs. Mesalazine was microencapsulated in chitosan particles in order to modulate its unfavorable pharmacokinetic profile exploiting the bioadhesive feature of the polysaccharide and increase the anti-inflammatory effect of the drug following its rectal administration in an in vivo model of induced IBD. The chitosan microparticles (1-4 μm mean size) allowed efficient retention of the mesalazine and a prolonged drug release lasting up to 48 h. In vitro and in vivo experiments confirmed the significant mucoadhesion feature of the formulation by means of mucin assay and CLSM experiments and demonstrated its therapeutic efficacy at a drug concentration 2-fold lower than the commercial formulation Asamax® (13 mg/kg vs 26 mg/kg).,Influence of nanosilica on inner structure and performance of chitosan based films.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30832876,Carbohydrate polymers,2019 03 12,"Chitosan based organic-inorganic composite films were prepared through direct incorporation of nanosilica particles in order to enhance their performance for potential packaging material. After the addition of nanosilica, the viscosity of film-forming solutions (FFSs) decreased obviously, and the G' of FFS with 25% of nanosilica was higher than that of other FFSs with nanosilica. In low field nuclear magnetic resonance (LF-NMR) determination, the addition of 25% of nanosilica gave rise to the lowest relaxation time and peak area proportion of T21 component. Additionally, the changes of structure characteristic of composite films with different nanosilica content were analyzed through FTIR spectroscopy, SEM and XRD analysis. The thermal stability of films improved markedly with increasing nanosilica. The optimal mechanical properties of films were yielded at 25% of nanosilica. Furthermore, the introduction of nanosilica significantly (p < 0.05) decreased the swelling ratio of chitosan based films at pH 7.6 and pH 2.6."

Compared with inorganic acid, heteropoly acid, acidic ionic liquid and other metal chlorides, WCl6 has shown better catalytic performance for degradation of cellulose to reducing sugar. The effect of reaction temperature, reaction time, WCl6 amount and cellulose concentration were investigated. Degradation of cellulose by WCl6 in 1-butyl-3-methyl imidazole chloride is a zero reaction.

The high stability of the well-ordered CHWs coating on the surface of the PDLLA film was confirmed by PBS soaking experiment in terms of the changes of weight and surface morphology of the film. The surface microstructure and composition of the resulting PDLLA-PDA-CHWs film were characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), atomic force microscope (AFM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and the thickness of the PDLLA, PDA and CHWs layers was determined using FESEM, too.

It was found that hydrolysis is accompanied by changes in thermodynamic parameters of diluted aqueous dispersions of partially hydrolyzed starches. Such changes are ensured by two processes directly from hydrolysis and accompanying annealing. At relatively low degrees of hydrolysis (less than 30%), changes in thermodynamic parameters are mainly controlled by annealing. At the same time, at high degrees of hydrolysis (more than 40%), the main contribution to changes in thermodynamic parameters of partially hydrolyzed starch granules is due to the hydrolysis itself. It has been established that the main controlling parameter is the thickness of crystalline lamellae Lcrl, which, when annealed, increases, but tends to decrease at deeper glucoamylolisis. It has been established that the thickness Lcrl of crystalline lamellae, which increases with annealing, but shows a tendency to decrease with deeper glucoamylolysis is the most representative parameter of changes in maize starch after hydrolysis.",Formulation and evaluation of cyclodextrin complexes for improved anticancer activity of repurposed drug: Niclosamide.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30832855,Carbohydrate polymers,2019 03 05,"Niclosamide, previously used as an anthelmintic drug is currently being repurposed for its anticancer activity.

Application of thiamine loaded chitosan nanoparticle enhanced seed germination and growth of chickpea seedlings when compared to untreated control seeds. Treated seedlings showed enhanced production of indole acetic acid (IAA). Foliar application of synthesized nanoparticle induced defense enzymes in leaves and roots of chickpea plants. Decreased cell death in the chickpea roots of treated plants was observed when compared to control under green house condition.

In this study, raw stalk of PM was characterized for physicochemical properties such as composition, moisture content, water absorbency and thermal behaviour. Morphology and crystallinity were studied using scanning electron microscope and X-ray diffraction respectively. Pure cellulose, extracted from the stalk using an optimised process, was characterised similarly. XRD patterns indicate the presence of cellulose type I structure with crystallinity index of 32% for raw stalk and 55% for the purified material. Water absorbency was 10 g/g for raw and 13 g/g for extracted cellulose. Material was thermally stable up to 200 °C.

The effects of drying temperature (45-85 °C) on the microstructure, mechanical and barrier properties of chitosan films were investigated. Chitosan films dried at higher temperatures showed smoother internal microstructures by forming smaller micro-region aggregations and lower ordered crystalline structures. Higher drying temperature also decreased the intermolecular interactions of chitosan chains according to Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analysis. These together led to the decrease in tensile strength, and the increase in water vapor and oxygen permeability. The film surface hydrophobicity remained unchanged at different drying temperatures, suggesting the applicability for chilled meat preservation. Chilled meat packaged with chitosan films had appropriate drip loss rate values as compared to those of the low-density polyethylene film and the blank sample, with lower thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, aerobic plate count, pH, and total volatile basic nitrogen values during 10 d storage. Moreover, films dried at lower temperatures showed superior juice retention capacity as well as superior preservation effect on chilled meat.

Chitosan nanoparticles (CsNPs) were prepared by sol-gel method using linking bridge of tripolyphosphate (TPP). Physiological properties of MPEO-CNs were assessed by FTIR, SEM/EDX, DLS and zeta potential. Release kinetics, MIC and MBC were determined for MPEO-CNs. Expression of biofilm-associated genes including 8 genes: grfB, C and D, brpA, spaP, gbpB, relA and vicR was investigated at the presence of sub-MIC of MPEO-CNs. Most abundant bioactive compounds of MPEO were l-menthol (45.05%) and l-menthal (17.53%). SEM/EDX exhibited successful entrapment of MPEO into CsNPs followed by the changes in abundance of elemental peaks. A signal at 1737 cm-1 on chitosan spectrum was attributed to the carboxylic (CO) groups overlapped by MPEO incorporation. A new signal at 2361 cm-1 was assigned to electrostatic interactions of amine groups in chitosan with phosphoric units of TPP within the MPEO-chitosan. MPEO incorporation into porous nanogel decreased monodispersity of the nanoparticles and then raises z-average. Maximum release of MPEO was about 50% during 360 h in a hydroalcoholic solvent at ambient temperature. The adherence of bacterial cells showed high sensitivity to the nanoformulation of MPEO compared with unloaded chitosan-nanogel. Antibiofilm inhibition of S. mutans occurred in 50 and 400 μg/mL for MPEO-CNs and unloaded-nanogel, respectively. Among biofilm synthesis genes, gtfB, gtfC, gtfD were slightly affected by MPEO-CNs treatment, while gbpB, spaP, brpA, relA, and vicR genes underwent significant down-regulation in the presence of both unloaded-nanogel and MPEO-loaded-nanogel. This study demonstrated that the MPEO-CNs promised an efficient nanoformulation with the greatest inhibitory action against some glycosyltransferase genes (gtfB, C and D) as important enzymes involved in extracellular polymers. Finally, the results concluded that MPEO-CNs have a potential use as antibiofilm agent in toothpaste or mouth washing formulations.",Miscibility studies of plastic-mimetic polypeptide with hydroxypropylmethylcellulose blends and generation of non-woven fabrics.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30832840,Carbohydrate polymers,2019 03 05,"In the current investigation, the results of viscometric measurements, thermal property, SEM, XRD and FTIR of the polymer blends containing synthetic plastic-based polypeptide (PLP) with hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC) on miscibility is discussed.

Then, the interaction between CMP and LSPC was characterized after mixing; the changes in spectral characteristics, thermal properties, crystallinity pattern, molecular weight, chain morphology and microrheological behaviour explained the influence of interaction on the structure of CMP and LSPC. The smaller molecular size, electrostatic interaction and stronger hydrophobic interaction might play important roles in improving the antibacterial activity of mixture. The dissociation constant (Kd) was determined to be 0.102±0.0008 mg/mL using MicroScale Thermophoresis (MST), and the micromorphology was observed by SEM.

This study aims at modifying the solution properties of PGuA in alkaline medium (aq. sodium hydroxide) to enable their conversion into electrospun nanofibers. Addition of anionic surfactants was found to play an important role in individualizing the PGuA chains that lead to formation of small spindle shaped fibers of length ranging from 2 to 10 μm and diameter from 287 to 997 nm. However, continuous fibers were not formed even at concentrations higher than the critical concentration. Addition of small amount (10-30%) of high molecular weight PVA resulted in formation of continuous fibers. Correlation of fiber diameters of PGuA/PVA with the rheological properties suggested a strong dependence of diameter with the elasticity of the blend solutions.

In view of the closely relationship between inflammation and renal fibrosis, and considering the significant role of other fungal polysaccharides on treatment of renal fibrosis, we speculated that PPUS may have therapeutic effects on renal fibrosis. However, there was not any reports about PPUS treatment this disease. The purpose of this paper is to investigate renoprotective effect and mechanism of PPUS on renal fibrosis. The results indicated that PPUS can improve renal function and ameliorate the degree of renal collagen deposition and further fibrosis. Its mechanism was found to be related with decreased inflammation, suppressive epithelial-mesenchymal transition, reconstructed the balance of matrix metalloproteinases and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases, and pro-fibrotic and anti-fibrotic factors. The data implied that PPUS can serve as a clinical candidate on treatment of renal interstitial fibrosis."

Currently, several prognostic markers and treatment options exist to guide treatment of HF with reduced ejection fraction, but echocardiographic deformation imaging suggests novel pathophysiologic aspects that could help optimize treatment further. Even though no formal treatment options currently exist for patients with HF with preserved ejection fraction, some HF medication does seem to attenuate strain measures. Speckle tracking has furthermore helped characterize this condition and to confer prognostic information. Thus, strain imaging could facilitate novel trials, and thereby hopefully introduce treatment opportunities.",Left Ventricular Mass and Thickness: Why Does It Matter?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30832808,Heart failure clinics,2019 04 19,"Several left ventricular geometric patterns have been described both in healthy and pathologic hearts. Left ventricular mass, wall thickness, and the ratio of wall thickness to radius are important measures to characterize the spectrum of left ventricular geometry. For clinicians, an increase in left ventricular mass is the hallmark of left ventricular hypertrophy. Although pathologic hypertrophy initially can be compensatory, eventually it may become maladaptive and evolve toward progressive left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure. In particular, patients who show left ventricular dilation and hypertrophy in association with a low relative wall thickness are likely to carry the highest risk.",Left Ventricular Size and Ejection Fraction: Are They Still Relevant?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30832807,Heart failure clinics,2019 04 19,"Despite the rapid development of emerging imaging technologies, left ventricular ejection fraction represents the cornerstone of diagnosis, choice of treatment, and prognosis in heart failure. However, true myocardial function often remains underestimated or overestimated in different conditions underlying this heterogeneous syndrome. Changes in left ventricular size and left ventricular ejection fraction, termed reverse remodeling, are among the main goals of treatment in heart failure, aimed at halting or attenuating disease progression. The lack of effective therapeutic approaches in nearly one-half of the heart failure population highlights the need for integrating novel echocardiographic measures to better understand the underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms.",Institutional Review Boards: What Clinician Researchers Need to Know.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30832791,Mayo Clinic proceedings,2019 03 05,"The institutional review board (IRB) is a group federally mandated to review and monitor research involving humans to ensure protection of their rights and welfare as research participants.

The second company of the Spanish Army Attack Helicopter Battalion (n = 15) performed three sets of standardized flight exercises with different levels of complexity (low [recognition flights], medium and high [emergency flights]). Throughout the flight exercises we recorded pilots' gaze entropy, as well as pilots' performance (assessed by an expert flight instructor) and subjective ratings of task load (assessed by the NASA-Task Load Index). Furthermore, we used pilots' electroencephalographic (EEG) activity as a reference physiological index for task load variations. We found that pilots' gaze entropy decreased ∼2% (i.e., visual scanning became less erratic) while solving the emergency flight exercises, showing a significant decreasing trend with increasing complexity (p < .05). This is in consonance with the ∼12% increase in the frontal theta band of their EEG spectra during said exercises. Pilots' errors and subjective ratings of task load increased as flight complexity increased (p-values < .05). Gaze data suggest that pilots used nondeterministic visual patterns when the aircraft was in an error-free state (low complexity), and changed their scanning behavior, becoming more deterministic, once emergencies occurred (medium/high complexity). Overall, our findings indicate that gaze entropy can serve as a sensitive index of task load in aviation settings.",The effects of hydration on cognitive performance during a simulated wildfire suppression shift in temperate and hot conditions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30832782,Applied ergonomics,2019 03 05,"The effects on dehydration and cognitive performance from heat and/or physical activity are well established in the laboratory, although have not yet been studied for personnel working in occupations such as wildland firefighting regularly exposed to these types of conditions.

Scenario workload was manipulated by increasing the number of aircraft released and the presence of a divided attention task. Results showed that scenario performance significantly degraded with increased aircraft and the presence of the divided attention task. No scenario performance differences were found between experience groups. The EEG engagement metric significantly differed between experience groups, with less experienced controllers exhibiting higher engagement than more experienced controllers. The EEG workload metric and pupil diameter were sensitive to workload manipulations but did not differentiate experience groups. Commercially available EEG cognitive state metrics may be a viable tool for enhancing ATC training."

While the effect of fatigue on limiting skill execution are well known, its influence on learning new skills is unclear. This is of particular interest as it is common practice to train athletes, musicians or perform rehabilitation exercises up to and beyond a point of fatigue. In a series of experiments, we describe how muscle fatigue, defined as degradation of maximum force after exertion, impairs motor-skill learning beyond its effects on task execution. The negative effects on learning are evidenced by impaired task acquisition on subsequent practice days even in the absence of fatigue. Further, we found that this effect is in part mediated centrally and can be alleviated by altering motor cortex function. Thus, the common practice of training while, or beyond, fatigue levels should be carefully reconsidered, since this affects overall long-term skill learning.",Non-vitamin K Antagonist Oral Anticoagulants (NOAC) as an Alternative Treatment Option in Tumor-Related Venous Thromboembolism.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30832760,Deutsches Arzteblatt international,2019 06 04,"The risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) is 4 to 7 times higher in cancer patients than in the normal population.

Gene expression profiles in GC of non-polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) obese (NPO), PCOS obese (PO), PCOS normal weight (PN) and non-PCOS normal weight (NPN) patients were analysed by microarray analysis. Compared with the NPN group, there were 16, 545 and 416 differently expressed genes in the NPO, PO and PN groups respectively. CD36 was the only intersecting gene, with greater than two fold changes in expression between the NPO versus NPN and PO versus NPN comparisons, and was not present in the PN versus NPN comparison. In addition, levels of CD36 protein were higher in GC from obese than normal weight patients. Furthermore, CD36 overexpression in a GC line inhibited cell proliferation, as determined by the cell counting kit-8 (CCK8) test, promoted cell apoptosis, as determined by flow cytometry, and inhibited the secretion of oestradiol by depositing triglyceride in cells and increasing cellular lipid peroxide levels. These adverse effects were reduced by sulfo-N-succinimidyloleate, a specific inhibitor of CD36. Together, the findings of this study suggest that obesity with and without PCOS should be regarded as separate entities, and that CD36 overexpression in GC of obese patients is one of the mechanisms by which obesity impairs GC function.",The Global Catalogue of Microorganisms (GCM) 10K type strain sequencing project: providing services to taxonomists for standard genome sequencing and annotation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30832757,International journal of systematic and evolutionary microbiology,2019 05 16,The World Federation of Culture Collections and the World Data Center for Microorganisms (wdcm) initiated an international community-led project to sequence and annotate newly described prokaryotic taxa.

But the biological function of IARS2 on acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has not yet been identified. In present study qRT-PCR was used to determine the expression of IARS2 in K562, THP1, HL-60 leukemia cells. Additionally the mRNA levels of IARS2 in CD34 cell and AML cells obtained from patients were detected by qRT-PCR.IARS2-shRNA lentiviral vector was established and used to infect acute myeloid leukemia HL-60 cells. qRT-PCR and Western blot analysis were employed to assess the knockdown effect of IARS2. The proliferation rate and cell cycle phase of HL60 cells after IARS2 knockdown were evaluated by CCK-8 assay and flow cytometry. The PathScan Antibody Array was used to determine the expression of cell cycle-related proteins in HL-60 cells after IARS2 knockdown. The expression of proliferation-related proteins in HL-60 cells after IARS2 knockdown were determined by Western blot analysis. Results showed IARS2 expression was stable and much higher in HL-60, THP-1 and K562 leukemia cells and AML cells obtained from patients than that of human CD34 cell. Compared with cells of the shCtrl group, IARS2 was markedly knocked down in cells which were transfected with lentivirus encoding shRNA of IARS2 in HL-60 cells (p<0.05). IARS2 knockdown significantly inhibited the proliferation and induced cycle arrest at the G1 phase in HL-60 cells. Additionally IARS2 knockdown significantly increased the expression of p53 and p21, and decreased the expression of PCNA and eIF4E in HL-60 cells. In conclusion, IARS2 knockdown can inhibit acute myeloid leukemia HL-60 cells proliferation and caused cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase by regulating P53 /P21 /PCNA /eIF4E pathways.",Nutlin-3-induced Sensitization of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Stem Cells to Axitinib-Induced Apoptosis through Repression of Akt1/Wnt Signaling.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30832755,Oncology research,2019 03 05,"To investigate the potential biological activities of nutlin-3 (N-3) in the regulation of growth and proliferation of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)stem cells (CSCs), which may help in sensitizing to axitinib-induced apoptosis. N-3 induction of p53 expression was used to test its role in controlling the cell division pattern and apoptosis of NSCLC cells. A549 cells and H460 cells were pretreated with N-3 and then treated with either an Akt1 activator or shRNA-GSK3β, to investigate the potential role of p53 sensitization in the biological effects of axitinib. We also determined the expression levels of GSK3β and p-Akt1 in patients with NSCLC and determined their potential association with survival data using Kaplan-Meier plots and CBIOTAL. Increased p53 expression stimulated the induction of apoptosis by axitinib and promoted asymmetric cell division (ACD) of NSCLC CSCs. The repression of Akt phosphorylation induced by N-3 promoted the ACD of lung CSCs, decreasing the proportion of the stem cell population. In addition to the induction of apoptosis by axitinib through inhibition of Wnt signaling, N-3 treatment further enhanced axitinib-induced apoptosis by inhibiting Akt1/GSK3β/Wnt signaling. The low expression of GSK3β and increased expression of p-Akt in patients with NSCLC were closely associated with the development of NSCLC. TP53 stimulates the induction of apoptosis in NSCLC by axitinib and the ACD of lung CSCs through its regulatory effects on the p53/Akt/ GSK3β pathways.",Knockdown of LncRNA PVT1 inhibits glioma progression by regulating miR-424 expression.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30832754,Oncology research,2019 03 05,"Plasmacytoma variability translocation 1 (PVT1), an oncogene, has been reported to be highly expressed in many tumors, including human glioma, gastric cancer, and non-small cell lung cancer. Functionally, it could also regulate the development of tumor cells. However, its specific roles and pathogenesis in human gliomas are still not clear. This study investigated the function and mechanism of PVT1 knockdown in the proliferation and malignant transformation of human gliomas. We firstly examined the expression levels of PVT1 and miR-424 in human glioma tissues and cell lines. We also used gene manipulation techniques to explore the effects of PVT1 knockdown on cell viability, migration, invasion, and miR-424. We found that PVT1 knockdown effectively inhibited cell viability, migration and invasion of human glioma cells and increased miR-424 expression. Based on the negative correlation between PVT1 and miR-424, we then confirmed the direct interaction between PVT1 and miR-424 using RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) and luciferase reporter assays. Further, we established a xenograft nude mouse model to determine the role and mechanism of PVT1 on tumor growth in vivo. In addition, PVT1 knockdown was shown to promote miR-424 in vivo. In summary, the present study demonstrated that PVT1 knockdown could negatively regulate miR-424 to inhibit human glioma cell activity, migration and invasiveness. PVT1 knockdown could negatively regulate miR-424 to inhibit cellular activity, migration and invasiveness in human gliomas, which explained the oncogenic mechanism of PVT1 in human gliomas. It also suggested that PVT1 might be a novel therapeutic target for human gliomas.",MicroRNA-101 targets CXCL12-mediated Akt and Snail signaling pathways to inhibit cellular proliferation and invasion in papillary thyroid carcinoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30832753,Oncology research,2019 03 05,"Escalating evidence suggests that microRNA-101 (miR-101) implicates in the development and progression of various cancers, including papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). However, the biological function and molecular mechanisms of miR-101 in PTC are still unclear. In this study, we demonstrated that miR-101 expression was significantly decreased in PTC tissues and cell lines. Clinically, low level of miR-101 was positively associated with advanced histological stages and lymph node and distant metastases. The expression of CXCL12 was negatively correlated with miR-101 level in PTC. CXCL12 was validated as a direct target of miR-101 in PTC cells. Functional experiments proved that miR-101 markedly reduced the proliferation, apoptosis escape, migration, and invasion of PTC cells. Moreover, CXCL12 restoration rescued the suppressive effects of miR-101 on PTC cells by activating Akt and EMT-associated signaling pathways. Overall, miR-101 exerts oncostatic effects on PTC by downregulating CXCL12 and repressing its downstream Akt and Snail signaling pathways, suggesting that miR-101/CXCL12/Akt or Snail axis may serve as a potential therapeutic target for PTC."

Yet, low and middle-income countries still lack an accurate cost-effective platform to perform this allocation. TaqMan Low Density array (TLDA) assay was performed using a set of 20 genes in 92 medulloblastoma samples. The same methodology was assessed in silico using microarray data for 763 medulloblastoma samples from the GSE85217 study, which performed MB classification by a robust integrative method (Transcriptional, Methylation and cytogenetic profile). Furthermore, we validated in 11 MBs samples our proposed method by Methylation Array 450 K to assess methylation profile along with 390 MB samples (GSE109381) and copy number variations. TLDA with only 20 genes accurately assigned MB samples into WNT, SHH, Group 3 and Group 4 using Pearson distance with the average-linkage algorithm and showed concordance with molecular assignment provided by Methylation Array 450 k. Similarly, we tested this simplified set of gene signatures in 763 MB samples and we were able to recapitulate molecular assignment with an accuracy of 99.1% (SHH), 94.29% (WNT), 92.36% (Group 3) and 95.40% (Group 4), against 97.31, 97.14, 88.89 and 97.24% (respectively) with the Ward.D2 algorithm. t-SNE analysis revealed a high level of concordance (k = 4) with minor overlapping features between Group 3 and Group 4. Finally, we condensed the number of genes to 6 without significantly losing accuracy in classifying samples into SHH, WNT and non-SHH/non-WNT subgroups. Additionally, we found a relatively high frequency of WNT subgroup in our cohort, which requires further epidemiological studies. TLDA is a rapid, simple and cost-effective assay for classifying MB in low/middle income countries. A simplified method using six genes and restricting the final stratification into SHH, WNT and non-SHH/non-WNT appears to be a very interesting approach for rapid clinical decision-making.","Health researchers' experiences, perceptions and barriers related to sharing study results with participants.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30832733,Health research policy and systems,2019 06 10,"Although research participants are generally interested in receiving results from studies in which they participate, health researchers rarely communicate study findings to participants.

There is a general lack of knowledge regarding PrEP among women at elevated risk, and only a small percentage of at-risk women are currently engaged in PrEP care. The period of incarceration represents an opportunity to identify at-risk women, initiate PrEP during incarceration, and establish linkage to community-based PrEP care upon release from incarceration. Further, post-release is a time period that is particularly risky, and there are numerous barriers, including substance use, that may impede linkage to community-based care in the absence of intervention. The current protocol describes plans for the development and pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) of an intervention to promote PrEP uptake during incarceration and facilitate linkage to community-based PrEP care post-release.",A comparison of DNA methylation in newborn blood samples from infants with and without orofacial clefts.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30832715,Clinical epigenetics,2019 04 23,"Isolated orofacial clefts are among the most common congenital birth defects.

Mental health problems generate a high burden of disease in society in general, and there is a significant treatment gap, especially among economically vulnerable populations. Prevention strategies appear to be the more recommendable options, mainly if these interventions can be implemented early in life and at low cost. Few preventive interventions aiming to increase resilience in the face of adversity have been rigorously evaluated among Chilean preschoolers. Substantial international evidence indicates that strengthening basic psychological skills, such as emotion regulation and social problem-solving, can reduce the incidence of mental pathology and improve various academic indicators. The curriculum of the Interpersonal Cognitive Problem-Solving Programme, also known as I Can Problem Solve (ICPS), is focussed on the development of the cognitive process and children's social problem-solving skills. ICPS is effective at increasing prosocial behaviours and reducing aggressive behaviour among preschoolers. ICPS provides children with the skills to think about how to solve problems using sequenced games, discussion, and group-interaction techniques focussed on listening to, and observing, others, promoting empathy and alternative and consequential thinking. The aims of this study are (1) to develop a culturally appropriate version of the ICPS programme and (2) to evaluate the acceptability and feasibility of the adapted version of ICPS among vulnerable schools in Santiago, Chile, conducting a pilot randomised controlled trial with three arms: (1) the ICPS programme delivered by an internal early teacher, (2) the ICPS programme delivered by an external early teacher, and (3) a control group.",FAT4 regulates the EMT and autophagy in colorectal cancer cells in part via the PI3K-AKT signaling axis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30832706,Journal of experimental & clinical cancer research : CR,2019 03 29,"FAT4 functions as a tumor suppressor, and previous findings have demonstrated that FAT4 can inhibit the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and the proliferation of gastric cancer cells.

Early childhood development (ECD) interventions that promote parent-child psychosocial stimulation and nutrition activities can help remediate early disadvantages in child development and health outcomes, but are difficult to scale. Key questions are: 1) how to maximize the reach and cost-effectiveness of ECD interventions; 2) what pathways connect interventions to parental behavioral changes and child outcomes; and 3) how to sustain impacts long-term.","Within-country migration and obesity dynamics: analysis of 94,783 women from the Peruvian demographic and health surveys.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30832623,BMC public health,2019 04 26,"Rural-to-urban migration is associated with increased obesity, yet it remains unknown whether this association exist, and to what extent, with other types of internal migration.",Alveolar soft part sarcoma metastatic to the breast: a case report.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30832622,BMC surgery,2019 04 12,"Alveolar soft part sarcoma (ASPS) is an extremely rare neoplasm that tends to occur in the lower limbs of children and adolescents.

An American Society of Transplantation (AST) Consensus Conference recommended that patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) Stages 3-5 have the opportunity to learn about and decide which treatment option is right for them, particularly about LDKT. However, early education about LDKT and DDKT outside of transplant centers is inconsistent and often poor, with patients in CKD 3 and 4 and ethnic/racial minorities even less likely to receive it. A new randomized control trial (RCT), in partnership with Kaiser Permanente Southern California (KPSC), will assess knowledge gaps and the effectiveness of a supplementary video-guided, print and technology-based education intervention for English- and Spanish-speaking patients in CKD Stages 3, 4, and 5 to increase LDKT knowledge and decision-making.
