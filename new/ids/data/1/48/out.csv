As the medical community increasingly deploys connected devices to deliver patient care, a critical question emerges: should the manufacturers and adopters of these connected technologies be governed by the symbolic spirit of the Hippocratic Oath? In 2016, I Am The Cavalry, a grassroots initiative from the cybersecurity research community, published the first Hippocratic Oath for Connected Medical Devices (HOCMD), containing 5 principles. Over the past three years, the HOCMD has gained broad support and influenced regulatory policy. We introduce 5 case studies of the HOCMD in practice, illustrating how the 5 principles can lead to a safer and more effective adoption of connected medical technologies.",Gender Moderates the Partial Mediation of Impulsivity in the Relationship Between Psychiatric Distress and Problematic Online Gaming: Online Survey.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30888322,JMIR mental health,2019 04 18,"Research has shown that some individuals can develop problematic patterns of online gaming, leading to significant psychological and interpersonal problems.

Even without such external perturbations, intrinsic sources like sensorimotor noise perturb the running motion incessantly, making each step variable. Here, using simple and generalizable models, we show that even such small step-to-step variability contains considerable information about strategies used to run stably. Deviations in the center of mass motion predict the corrective strategies during the next stance, well in advance of foot touchdown. Horizontal motion is stabilized by total leg impulse modulations, whereas the vertical motion is stabilized by differentially modulating the impulse within stance. We implement these human-derived control strategies on a simple computational biped, showing that it runs stably for hundreds of steps despite incessant noise-like perturbations or larger discrete perturbations. This running controller derived from natural variability echoes behaviors observed in previous animal and robot studies.","Guy1, a Y-linked embryonic signal, regulates dosage compensation in Anopheles stephensi by increasing X gene expression.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30888319,eLife,2019 04 03,"We previously showed that Guy1, a primary signal expressed from the Y chromosome, is a strong candidate for a male-determining factor that confers female-specific lethality in Anopheles stephensi (Criscione et al., 2016). Here, we present evidence that Guy1 increases X gene expression in Guy1-transgenic females from two independent lines, providing a mechanism underlying the Guy1-conferred female lethality. The median level gene expression (MGE) of X-linked genes is significantly higher than autosomal genes in Guy1-transgenic females while there is no significant difference in MGE between X and autosomal genes in wild-type females. Furthermore, Guy1 significantly upregulates at least 40% of the 996 genes across the X chromosome in transgenic females. Guy1-conferred female-specific lethality is remarkably stable and completely penetrant. These findings indicate that Guy1 regulates dosage compensation in An. stephensi and components of dosage compensation may be explored to develop novel strategies to control mosquito-borne diseases.",Plasmodium Niemann-Pick type C1-related protein is a druggable target required for parasite membrane homeostasis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30888318,eLife,2019 06 14,"Plasmodium parasites possess a protein with homology to Niemann-Pick Type C1 proteins (Niemann-Pick Type C1-Related protein, NCR1). We isolated parasites with resistance-conferring mutations in Plasmodium falciparum NCR1 (PfNCR1) during selections with three diverse small-molecule antimalarial compounds and show that the mutations are causative for compound resistance. PfNCR1 protein knockdown results in severely attenuated growth and confers hypersensitivity to the compounds. Compound treatment or protein knockdown leads to increased sensitivity of the parasite plasma membrane (PPM) to the amphipathic glycoside saponin and engenders digestive vacuoles (DVs) that are small and malformed. Immuno-electron microscopy and split-GFP experiments localize PfNCR1 to the PPM. Our experiments show that PfNCR1 activity is critically important for the composition of the PPM and is required for DV biogenesis, suggesting PfNCR1 as a novel antimalarial drug target.",Dissociation rate compensation mechanism for budding yeast pioneer transcription factors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30888317,eLife,2019 04 07,"Nucleosomes restrict the occupancy of most transcription factors (TF) by reducing binding and accelerating dissociation, while a small group of TFs have high affinities to nucleosome-embedded sites and facilitate nucleosome displacement. To understand this process mechanistically, we investigated two Saccharomyces cerevisiae TFs, Reb1 and Cbf1. We show that these factors bind to their sites within nucleosomes with similar binding affinities as to naked DNA, trapping a partially unwrapped nucleosome without histone eviction. Both the binding and dissociation rates of Reb1 and Cbf1 are significantly slower at the nucleosomal sites relative to those for naked DNA, demonstrating that the high affinities are achieved by increasing the dwell time on nucleosomes in order to compensate for reduced binding. Reb1 also shows slow migration rate in the yeast nuclei. These properties are similar to those of human pioneer factors (PFs), suggesting that the mechanism of nucleosome targeting is conserved from yeast to humans.",Identification and typing of Yersinia enterocolitica and Yersinia pseudotuberculosis isolated from human clinical specimens in England between 2004 and 2018.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30888316,Journal of medical microbiology,2019 04 25,"PurposeandMethodology. Epidemiological and microbiological data on Yersinia enterocolitica (n=699) and Yersinia pseudotuberculosis (n=35) isolated from human clinical specimens in England between April 2004 and March 2018 were reviewed. Traditional biochemical species identification and serological typing results were compared with species identifications and serotypes derived from whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data for a sub-set of these isolates (n=179).Results. Most Y. enterocolitica isolates were from faecal specimens (74.4%) from adults (80.7%) and 50.7  % of isolates were from male patients. Most Y. pseudotuberculosis isolates were from blood cultures (68.6%) from adults (91%) and 60.0  % of isolates were from male patients. All sequenced isolates of Y. enterocolitica (n=158) and Y. pseudotuberculosis (n=21), as well as isolates belonging to other Yersinia species (n=21), were correctly identified from genomic data using a kmer-based identification approach. Traditional phenotypic serotyping typed 82/158 and 12/21 isolates of Y. enterocolitica and Y. pseudotuberculosis, respectively, while 118/158 and 21/21 isolates of Y. enterocolitica and Y. pseudotuberculosis, respectively, were typed by the genome-derived serotyping method. In addition, WGS data provided a multi-locus sequence type profile and virulence gene profile for all isolates.Conclusion. The use of WGS for typing Y. enterocolitica and Y. pseudotuberculosis at Public Health England will facilitate the monitoring of animal-to-human transmission of these important foodborne pathogens in the UK and improve public health surveillance of the pathogenic lineages.","Lactobacillus suantsaii sp. nov., isolated from suan-tsai, a traditional Taiwanese fermented mustard green.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30888315,International journal of systematic and evolutionary microbiology,2019 05 23,"A Gram-stain-positive, rod-shaped, non-motile, catalase-negative and facultative anaerobic strain, L88T, was isolated from suan-tsai, a traditional Taiwanese fermented mustard green.

While the cardiovascular effects of nationally regulated criteria pollutants (e.g., fine particulate matter [PM2.5] and nitrogen dioxide) have been well documented, there are fewer studies on particulate pollutants that are more specific for traffic, such as black carbon (BC) and particle number (PN). In this paper, we synthesized studies conducted in the Greater Boston Area on cardiovascular health effects of traffic exposure, specifically defined by BC or PN exposure or proximity to major roadways. Large cohort studies demonstrate that exposure to traffic-related particles adversely affect cardiac autonomic function, increase systemic cytokine-mediated inflammation and pro-thrombotic activity, and elevate the risk of hypertension and ischemic stroke. Key patterns emerged when directly comparing studies with overlapping exposure metrics and population cohorts. Most notably, cardiovascular risk estimates of PN and BC exposures were larger in magnitude or more often statistically significant compared to those of PM2.5 exposures. Across multiple exposure metrics (e.g., short-term versus long-term, observed versus modeled) and different population cohorts (e.g., elderly, individuals with co-morbidities, young healthy individuals), there is compelling evidence that BC and PN represent traffic-related particles that are especially harmful to cardiovascular health. Further research is needed to validate these findings in other geographic locations, characterize exposure errors associated with using monitored and modeled traffic pollutant levels, and elucidate pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the cardiovascular effects of traffic-related particulate pollutants.","Costs and cost-effectiveness of three point-of-use water treatment technologies added to community-based treatment of severe acute malnutrition in Sindh Province, Pakistan.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30888265,Global health action,2019 05 29,"Severe acute malnutrition (SAM) is a major global public health concern.

PUF was treated with hydrochloric acid to increase the active sites and then the active carboxyl groups and amino groups were exposed. Enzyme activity of lipase immobilized on PUF-HCL (8000 U/g) was 50% higher than that of lipase immobilized on PUF (5300 U/g). There is an increase in the activity of the immobilized lipase on AA/PEI-modified support (115,000 U/g), a 2.17-fold increase compared to lipase immobilized on the native support was observed. The activity of immobilized lipases was dependent on the PEI molecular weight, with best results from enzyme immobilized on PUF-HCL-AA/PEI (MW 70,000 Da, 12,800 U/g)), which was 2.41 times higher compared to that of the same enzyme immobilized on PUF. These results suggest that the activity of immobilized lipase is influenced by the support surface properties, and a moderate support surface micro-environment is crucial for improving enzyme activity. Finally, the immobilized lipase was used for the production of vitamin A palmitate. The immobilized lipase can be reused for up to 18 times with a conversion rate above 90% for 12 h in a 3 L bioreactor.

Water treatment residues (WTR) are proven adsorbent for remediation of many water- and soil-borne anions (perchlorate, selenium and arsenic), and may be able to remove fluoride from contaminated water. In this study, the sustainable reuse of the freely available waste of the drinking water treatment plants, namely WTR, was explored for their fluoride removal potential to meet drinking water standards. WTR was characterized by specific surface area, Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), scanning electron microscopy and X-ray powder diffraction (XRD). Batch adsorption experiments were conducted as a function of WTR dose, contact time, agitation speed, initial fluoride concentration, initial temperature and water pH to get best adsorption capacity. About 90% fluoride removal (from initial 5.0 mg/L) was observed within 2 h contact time at WTR dose of 28 g/L. Also, WTR effectively removed fluoride in the pH range of 5-8, whereas removal efficiency decreased at pH 9 or higher. The adsorption equilibrium was established within 120-150 min. Adsorption isotherm data were best fit to Langmuir (R2 = 0.984) and Freundlich models (R2 = 0.983), while adsorption kinetic study exhibited that second-order kinetic model was followed with rate constant of 0.038 g/mg min. The FT-IR and XRD analyses affirmed that the metal hydroxyl and metal oxide groups contributed to the fluoride removal. The experimental results show the promising potential of WTR as an adsorbent in fluoride removal from real contaminated groundwater.","Single and dual diagnoses of major depressive disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder predicted by triple comorbid trajectories of tobacco, alcohol, and marijuana use among urban adults.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30888260,Substance abuse,2019 03 19,"The adverse consequences of major depressive disorder (MDD) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) affect a significant portion of the US population every year (i.e., 15 million for MDD; 8 million for PTSD) and are of public health concern.

Today, bone mineral density is measured by radiological techniques. Alternative techniques are needed because of the disadvantages such as excessive radiation intake, the cost of radiological techniques, and the necessity for specialist personnel for the devices. The quantitative determination of biochemical markers that play a role in bone mineralization may be a good alternative for the osteoporosis diagnosis and especially in the follow-up of treatment. In this study, a specific and sensitive immunological biosensor, which quantitatively determines the osteocalcin molecule, has been developed to be used in the early osteoporosis diagnosis and to evaluate the response to the drug treatment. Anti-osteocalcin antibody was immobilized onto gold electrode surface via covalent immobilization method by using 6-mercaptohexanol, 1,4-butanedioldiglycidyl ether, ethanolamine, and glutaraldehyde. Immobilization steps and biosensor characterization were specified by cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The detection time and range of Ocn biosensor were determined as 45 min and 10-60 pg µL-1 Ocn concentration, respectively. The Ocn biosensor was successfully applied in artificial serum samples spiked with Ocn.",Scaphoid fracture geometrics: an assessment of location and orientation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30888244,Journal of plastic surgery and hand surgery,2019 05 16,"The location and angle of scaphoid fractures are important attributes which guide management. We used a 3 dimensional scaphoid model, generated from CT scans, to map scaphoid fracture planes. The point at which the fracture plane crossed the central axis of the scaphoid was noted. The angle of the fracture planes with regard to the central axis was also noted. This allowed calculation of the location of the fracture and the angle of the 379 fractures. The mean point of intersection for fractures with the scaphoid axis was 50% along the scaphoid. Sixty percent of all fractures were found around the central 20% of the scaphoid. The mean angle between the scaphoid axis and the fracture plane was 63 degrees). On comparing angle with location, as fractures move away from the scaphoid waist, they become less perpendicular to the scaphoid axis (p < .01). Older patients are more likely to have proximal fractures (p < .01). Men are more at risk of proximal scaphoid fractures than women (p < .001). Proximal fractures increases risk of progressing to non-union (p = .018). There was no link between fracture plane angles and age, sex and union status. Most fractures occur at the centre of the scaphoid. There is a link between the location and angle of scaphoid fractures. It also identifies older patients and males are more likely to have more proximal scaphoid fractures.",3 T - MRI improves intrameatal cranial nerve detection in CI-candidates.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30888243,Acta oto-laryngologica,2019 05 06,Cochlear implantation meanwhile is a well established standard therapy in different forms of hearing loss in most ages.

Cyclic phenones are chemicals of interest to the USEPA due to their potential for endocrine disruption to aquatic and terrestrial species. 2. Prior to this report, there was very limited information addressing metabolism of cyclic phenones by fish species and the potential for estrogen receptor (ER) binding and vitellogenin (Vtg) gene activation by their metabolites. 3. The main objectives of the current research were to characterize rainbow trout (rt) liver slice-mediated in vitro metabolism of model parent cyclic phenones exhibiting disparity between ER binding and ER-mediated Vtg gene induction, and to assess the metabolic competency of fish liver in vitro tests to help determine the chemical form (parent and/or metabolite) associated with the observed biological response. 4. GC-MS, HPLC and LC-MS/MS technologies were applied to investigate the in vitro biotransformation of cyclobutyl phenyl ketone (CBP), benzophenone (DPK), cyclohexyl phenyl ketone (CPK) mostly in the absence of standards for metabolite characterization. 5. It was concluded that estrogenic effects of the studied cyclic phenones are mediated by the parent chemical structure for DPK, but by active metabolites for CPK. A definitive interpretation was not possible for CBP and CBPOH (alcohol), although a contribution of both structures to gene induction is suspected."

Participants (n = 34) were randomly assigned to a resistance training group (RTG; n = 12), an aerobic training group (ATG; n = 11), or a control group (n = 11). The ATG completed 30-45 min of aerobic running training at 65%-75% of the maximum heart rate. The RTG completed three sets of 10 repetitions maximum of leg press, bench press, knee extension, seated cable row, knee flexion, military press, and calf rise. Blood samples were taken before and after the training period to assess dependent variables. After 8 weeks, both the ATG and the RTG reduced fetuin-A (p < 0.05) and fetuin-B (p < 0.05), but increased FGF-21 (p < 0.05). Moreover, the RTG showed greater decrease than the ATG in fetuin-A (-18.3% vs. -7.9%), fetuin-B (-29.2% vs. -11.45%), and a lower increase in FGF-21 (42.2% vs. 25.1%), respectively. Aerobic and resistance exercise training significantly decreased serum fetuin-A, and fetuin-B, and increased FGF-21 levels in males with type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, more significant alterations in serum factors were observed from resistance training. Thus, resistance training may be considered a more suitable training strategy.",Effect of voluntary exercise on intracellular signalling pathways of angiogenesis in the sciatic nerve of type 1 diabetic castrated male rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30888220,Physiology international,2019 05 29,Impaired angiogenesis in sciatic nerve is a major complication of diabetic neuropathy.

A narrative review methodology is employed. Herein, the different types of glial cells, their implications in subserving episodic memory function, and how exercise can modulate glial cell activity, particularly astrocyte functionality, are discussed. Although additional experimental work is needed, astrocytes appear to play an important role in the exercise-memory interaction. Exercise may increase astrocytic size, attenuate astrogliodegeneration, improve astrocytic aquaporin-4 expression, and increase astrocytic transporter levels. These effects, in turn, may help to increase the number of synapses that neurons form, increase the number of synaptic structures, and increase presynaptic function and postsynaptic receptor localization. Ultimately, these effects may help influence long-term potentiation and episodic memory function.",Homocysteine-induced inverse expression of tissue factor and DPP4 in endothelial cells is related to NADPH oxidase activity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30888218,Physiology international,2019 05 29,"We previously found that homocysteine (Hcy)-induced apoptosis in endothelial cells coincided with increased NADPH oxidase (NOX) activity.

Because of challenges associated with the availability of archived tissue, liquid biopsies are often performed to detect cancer-specific mutations. One of the major advantages of the liquid biopsy is that the treatment can be monitored longitudinally, even after the tumor tissue is no longer available. In a clinical setting, one component of precision medicine is the detection of cancer-specific mutations using archived samples. In this study, we evaluated the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation status of samples of lung cancer patients stored before introduction of the plasma EGFR test at our institution. The aim of this study was to validate the utility of archived plasma samples for detection of the EGFR mutation in nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. The Cobas® EGFR Mutation Test v2 was the first liquid biopsy test approved as a companion diagnostic test for patients with NSCLC treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors. We tested for the EGFR mutation in 116 plasma samples archived in the biobank, and the results were compared with those obtained in the tissue or cytology EGFR mutation test. The EGFR mutation-positive rate from archived plasma was lower than that determined from tissue or cytology at 19.0% and 53.4%, respectively, and the concordance rate between the two tests was 58.6%. Of interest, five (4.3%) samples showed the T790M mutation in the plasma test, whereas this mutation was only detected in two (1.7%) tissue/cytology samples. Five (4.3%) samples were additionally positive in the plasma test. Overall, these results indicate that archived plasma samples can serve as an alternative source for the plasma EGFR mutation test when tissue samples are not available, and can improve precision medicine and long-term follow-up in a noninvasive manner.",Mawangdui-Type Ancient Human Cadavers in China and Strategies for Their Long-Term Preservation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30888198,Biopreservation and biobanking,2019 04 09,"Ancient human remains may exist as intact cadavers in various forms, including mummies as well as humid or soft corpses. These valuable human depositories have been increasingly investigated with modern molecular biological approaches, delivering breakthrough discoveries in the field of paleoanthropology. Many ancient remains are also preserved in museums for public education of the history of human civilization. The Mawangdui tomb No. 1 cadaver was unearthed in 1972 in Changsha, China, and is a well-preserved humid-type corpse of a deceased woman who lived in the Western Han Dynasty (206BC-24AD). During the past few decades, a number of other similar cadavers have been discovered in China. The Mawangdui cadaver thus appears to represent an archetype of the humid corpses that are commonly unearthed from buried coffins, but show a great extent of anatomical and histological integrity at the time of excavation. Long-term protection of these cadavers is important with regard to scientific investigation and heritage conservation, while challenges exist to develop effective preservation protocols. In this perspective article, we describe the overall features of the humid cadavers found in China, and discuss the factors that potentially contributed to their preservation before excavation. We also introduce the efforts taken for, and experience learned from, postexcavation preservation of the Mawangdui cadaver during the past four decades. Finally, we propose that research into the mechanism governing the breakdown of macromolecules may provide potential solutions for extended protection of these valuable ancient human remains.",#Motherhoodishard: Narrating Our Research and Mothering in the Postpartum Stage through Texting and Social Media.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30888197,Health communication,2019 03 19,"We narrate our personal journey through the political minefield that is postpartum crisis by examining our communicative strategies across friendship, research partnership and as mothers on social media platforms.

Although the surface structure of the nanowires essentially determines their interaction with adsorbed molecules, understanding the correlation between an oxide nanowire surface and an adsorbed molecule is still a major challenge. Herein, we propose a rational methodology to obtain this information for low-density molecules adsorbed on metal oxide nanowire surfaces by employing infrared p-polarized multiple-angle incidence resolution spectroscopy and temperature-programmed desorption/gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. As a model system, we studied the surface chemical transformation of an aldehyde (nonanal, a cancer biomarker in breath) on single-crystalline ZnO nanowires. We found that a slight surface reconstruction, induced by the thermal pretreatment, determines the surface chemical reactivity of nonanal. The present results show that the observed surface reaction trend can be interpreted in terms of the density of Zn ions exposed on the nanowire surface and of their corresponding spatial arrangement on the surface, which promotes the reaction between neighboring adsorbed molecules. The proposed methodology will support a better understanding of complex molecular transformations on various nanostructured metal-oxide surfaces.","Effects of Amiloride, an Ion Channel Blocker, on Alamethicin Pore Formation in Negatively Charged, Gold-Supported, Phospholipid Bilayers: A Molecular View.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30888178,Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids,2019 04 09,"The effects of amiloride on the structure and conductivity of alamethicin ion pore formation within negatively charged, gold-supported, 1,2-dimyristoyl- sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine/Egg-PG membranes were investigated with the help of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), photon polarization modulation-infrared reflection spectroscopy (PM-IRRAS), and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The EIS results indicate that ion conductivity across negatively charged phospholipid bilayers containing alamethicin decreases by an order of magnitude when amiloride is introduced to the system. Despite the reduction in ion conductivity, the PM-IRRAS data shows that amiloride does not inhibit ion channel formation by alamethicin peptides. High-resolution AFM images revealed that amiloride enlarges and distorts the shape of alamethicin ion pores when introduced to the system, indicating that it is inserting itself into the mouth of the alamethicin pores. This effect is driven by electrostatic interactions between positively charged amiloride molecules and the negative charge on the membrane.",Cu-Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydroboration of Naphthylallylic Compounds for Enantioselective Synthesis of Chiral Boronates.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30888177,The Journal of organic chemistry,2019 04 05,A Cu-catalyzed regio- and enantioselective hydroboration of various naphthylallylic compounds affording chiral boronates with high yields and excellent enantioselectivities (up to 96% ee) was presented.

In contrast to lower S-states (S0, S1), in higher S-states (S2, S3) of the Mn4CaO5 cluster, YZ cannot be oxidized at cryogenic temperatures due to the accumulation of positive charge in the S1 → S2 transition. However, oxidation of YZ by illumination of S2 at 77-190 K followed by rapid freezing and charge recombination between YZ• and the plastoquinone radical QA•- allows trapping of an S2 variant, the so-called S2trapped state (S2t), that is capable of forming YZ• at cryogenic temperature. To identify the differences between the S2 and S2t states, we used the S2tYZ• intermediate as a probe for the S2t state and followed the S2tYZ•/QA•- recombination kinetics at 10 K using time-resolved electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy in H2O and D2O. The results show that while S2tYZ•/QA•- recombination can be described as pure electron transfer occurring in the Marcus inverted region, the S2t → S2 reversion depends on proton rearrangement and exhibits a strong kinetic isotope effect. This suggests that YZ oxidation in the S2t state is facilitated by favorable proton redistribution in the vicinity of YZ, most likely within the hydrogen-bonded YZ-His190-Asn298 triad. Computational models show that tautomerization of Asn298 to its imidic acid form enables proton translocation to an adjacent asparagine-rich cavity of water molecules that functions as a proton reservoir and can further participate in proton egress to the lumen.",Simultaneous Growth of Pure Wurtzite and Zinc Blende Nanowires.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30888174,Nano letters,2019 04 11,"The opportunity to engineer III-V nanowires in wurtzite and zinc blende crystal structure allows for exploring properties not conventionally available in the bulk form as well as opening the opportunity for use of additional degrees of freedom in device fabrication. However, the fundamental understanding of the nature of polytypism in III-V nanowire growth is still lacking key ingredients to be able to connect the results of modeling and experiments. Here we show InP nanowires of both pure wurtzite and pure zinc blende grown simultaneously on the same InP [100]-oriented substrate. We find wurtzite nanowires to grow along [Formula: see text] and zinc blende counterparts along [Formula: see text]. Further, we discuss the nucleation, growth, and polytypism of our nanowires against the background of existing theory. Our results demonstrate, first, that the crystal growth conditions for wurtzite and zinc blende nanowire growth are not mutually exclusive and, second, that the interface energies predominantly determine the crystal structure of the nanowires.",Edge Effects in Benzenoid and Total Resonant Sextet Benzenoid Hydrocarbons and Clar's Sextet Principle.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30888173,The journal of physical chemistry. A,2019 04 12,"Because the effect of a benzenoid perimeter edge on a sextet pattern is of paramount importance, trends in the degree of sextet aromaticity are determined. The spectacular structural isomorphism between the total set of benzenoid hydrocarbons and its strain-free total resonant sextet (TRS) subset as described herein is an unequivocal demonstration of the validity of the Clar sextet principle. Aromaticity and the Clar's sextet principle are intricately related which form the basis of this isomorphism. Hexagons on the edge of a polycyclic benzenoid hydrocarbon tend to have higher spin density, have a higher probability of sextet residence, be more reactive to substitution reactions, and have a perimeter topology described by four distinct parameters by means of a very simple relation. It is shown that because the location of Clar sextets in TRS benzenoids is totally fixed, the relative order of ring aromaticity of the peripheral benzene hexagons can be predicted from their topology. Using Bosanac and Gutman's energy effect ( ef) and Aihara's bond resonance energy, we show for the first time that the relative order of decreasing ring aromaticity for perimeter edge hexagons in any specific TRS benzenoid is quarto > trio > duo > solo > empty. TRS benzenoid hydrocarbons are those isomers in benzenoids having their number of formula carbons divisible by six and a maximum number of perimeter bay regions (ηo) given by η0(TRS) = (1/2) NH(sextet) - 3 + F. NH(sextet) is the number of formula hydrogens and F is the number of perimeter fjords (triplet of adjacent bay regions); for strain-free TRS benzenoids, F = 0.",Amoebae Assemble Synthetic Spherical Particles To Form Reproducible Constructs.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30888172,Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids,2019 04 09,"Difflugia are testate amoebae that use particulate inorganic matter to build a protective shell (generally called a test or theca). Difflugia globulosa were grown both in culture containing only naturally occurring theca-building materials and under conditions where synthetic particles were present also. The presence of monodisperse Stöber silica microspheres of 1, 3, and 6 μm in diameter or 4 μm polystyrene spheres dramatically increased the rate of Difflugia growth, and foreign microspheres became the overwhelmingly dominant construction material. Optical and electron microscopy of the 6 μm particle studies revealed that Difflugia construct spherical vase-shaped thecae with strikingly reproducible composition, morphology, and size. Time-lapse photography revealed construction techniques and masonry skills as Difflugia herded particles together, trapped them using phagocytosis, and applied the particles with biocement from inside the developing theca. The reported observations identify taxonomy complications, biomicrofabrication possibilities, and a discrete environmental impact of synthetic particle pollutants.",Tailoring Passivation Molecular Structures for Extremely Small Open-Circuit Voltage Loss in Perovskite Solar Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30888171,Journal of the American Chemical Society,2019 04 10,"Passivation of electronic defects at the surface and grain boundaries of perovskite materials has become one of the most important strategies to suppress charge recombination in both polycrystalline and single-crystalline perovskite solar cells. Although many passivation molecules have been reported, it remains very unclear regarding the passivation mechanisms of various functional groups. Here, we systematically engineer the structures of passivation molecular functional groups, including carboxyl, amine, isopropyl, phenethyl, and tert-butylphenethyl groups, and study their passivation capability to perovskites. It reveals the carboxyl and amine groups would heal charged defects via electrostatic interactions, and the neutral iodine related defects can be reduced by the aromatic structures. The judicious control of the interaction between perovskite and molecules can further realize grain boundary passivation, including those that are deep toward substrates. Understanding of the underlining mechanisms allows us to design a new passivation molecule, D-4- tert-butylphenylalanine, yielding high-performance p-i-structure solar cells with a stabilized efficiency of 21.4%. The open-circuit voltage ( VOC) of a device with an optical bandgap of 1.57 eV for the perovskite layer reaches 1.23 V, corresponding to a record small VOC deficit of 0.34 V. Our findings provide a guidance for future design of new passivation molecules to realize multiple facets applications in perovskite electronics.",Fabricating an Acetylcholinesterase Modulated UCNPs-Cu2+ Fluorescence Biosensor for Ultrasensitive Detection of Organophosphorus Pesticides-Diazinon in Food.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30888170,Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,2019 04 19,"In this study, a highly sensitive upconversion fluorescence (FL) biosensor was developed for the detection of organophosphorus pesticides (OPs) based on an acetylcholinesterase (AChE) modulated FL ""off-on-off"" strategy. The luminescence of synthesized UCNPs could be quenched strongly by Cu2+ due to an energy transfer effect. Upon addition of AChE and acetylthiocholine (ATCh), the enzymatic hydrolysate (thiocholine) could seize Cu2+ from UCNPs-Cu2+ mixture, resulting in the quenched FL triggered on. OPs could irreversibly impede the activity of AChE, which caused the formation of thiocholine to decrease, thus, reduced the recovery of FL. Under the optimum conditions, a linear detection range from 0.1 to 50 ng/mL was achieved for the representative OPs (diazinon) with LOD of 0.05 ng/mL. Furthermore, the ability of the biosensor to detect OPs was also confirmed in adulterated environmental and agricultural samples. In validation analysis, the proposed sensor showed satisfactory results ( p > 0.05) with GC-MS."

Here, we focus on the P5' residue in the Bowman-Birk inhibitory loop and produce a library of SFTI variants to characterize the P5' specificity of 11 different proteases. We identify seven amino acids that are generally preferred by these enzymes and also correlate with P5' sequence diversity in naturally occurring Bowman-Birk inhibitors. Additionally, we show that several enzymes have divergent specificities that can be harnessed in engineering studies. By optimizing the P5' residue, we improve the potency or selectivity of existing inhibitors for kallikrein-related peptidase 5 and show that a variant with substitutions at 7 of the scaffold's 14 residues retains a similar structure to SFTI-1. These findings provide new insights into P5' specificity requirements for the Bowman-Birk inhibitory loop.","A Dual Cross-Linked Strategy to Construct Moldable Hydrogels with High Stretchability, Good Self-Recovery, and Self-Healing Capability.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30888158,Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,2019 04 19,"Most conventional synthetic hydrogels suffer from poor mechanical properties; despite recent significant progress in fabricating tough hydrogels, it is still a challenge to simultaneously realize high stretchability, self-recovery, and self-healing capability in a hydrogel. In this work, a new type of starch/PVA/borax hybrid dual cross-linked (DC) hydrogel was synthesized by a one-pot method. The as-prepared DC hydrogels exhibited mechanical properties of remarkable extensibility (ca. 2485%), excellent toughness (ca. 290.5 kJ m-3), high compression strength (ca. 547.8 kPa), rapid recoverability (81.9% energy recovery after 30 min), and free-shapeable behavior. More impressively, the DC gels sustained approximately 300 times their own weight and exhibited an outstanding self-healing capability at room temperature both in air and underwater. Furthermore, the adsorption amount of methylene blue onto the anionic DC gel (144.68 mg/g) was much higher than that of corn starch gel. Consequently, the eco-friendly, stable, and biodegradable hydrogels will have a great potential application in removing anionic dyes from the wastewater produced by agriculture and industry.","Comparative Study of Electrical Conduction and Oxygen Diffusion in the Rhombohedral and Bixbyite Ln6MoO12 (Ln = Er, Tm, Yb) Polymorphs.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30888157,Inorganic chemistry,2019 04 01,"Electrical conduction and oxygen diffusion mobility in the bixbyite ( Ia3̅) and rhombohedral ( R3̅) polymorphs of the Ln6MoO12-Δ (Ln = Er, Tm, Yb; Δ = δ, δ1, δ2; δ1 > δ2) heavy lanthanide molybdates, belonging to new, previously unexplored classes of potential mixed (ionic-electronic) conductors, have been studied in the range of 200-900 °C. The oxygen self-diffusion coefficient in bixbyite ( Ia3̅) Yb6MoO12-δ phase estimated by the temperature-programmed heteroexchange with C18O2 was shown to be much higher than that for rhombohedral ( R3̅) RI (with large oxygen deficiency) and ( R3̅) RII (with small oxygen deficiency) Ln6MoO12-Δ (Ln = Tm, Yb; Δ = δ1; δ1 > δ2) oxides. According to the activation energy for total conduction in ambient air, 0.99, 0.93, and 1.01 eV in Er6MoO12-δ, Tm6MoO12-δ, and Yb6MoO12-δ bixbyites, respectively, oxygen ion conductivity prevails in the range ∼200-500 °C. Oxygen mobility data for the rhombohedral Ln6MoO12-Δ (Ln = Er, Tm, Yb; Δ = δ1, δ2) phases RI and RII indicate that the oxygen in these phases exhibits mobility at much higher temperatures, such as those above 600-700 °C. Accordingly, below 600-700 °C they have predominantly electronic conductivity. As shown by total conductivity study of Ln6MoO12-δ (Ln = Er, Tm, Yb) bixbyites ( Ia3̅) and rhombohedral phases Ln6MoO12-Δ (Ln = Er, Tm, Yb; Δ = δ1, δ2) ( R3̅) in dry and wet air, the proton conductivity contribution exists only in Ln6MoO12-δ (Ln = Er, Tm, Yb) bixbyites up to 450-600 °C and decreases with a decreasing of the lanthanide ionic radius. The obtained data on the mobility of oxygen and the presence of proton contribution in bixbyites in the 300-600 °C temperature range make it possible to confirm unequivocally that Ln6MoO12-δ (Ln = Er, Tm, Yb) bixbyites are mixed electron-proton conductors at these temperatures.",Impact of Crystal Types of AgFeO2 Nanoparticles on the Peroxymonosulfate Activation in the Water.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30888156,Environmental science & technology,2019 04 16,"A simple co-precipitation method was developed to synthesize AgFeO2 nanoparticles (NPs) with hexagonal 2H and 3R polytypes coexistence. The ratio of 2H and 3R types in AgFeO2 NPs were regulated by controlling the calcination temperature (300, 400, and 500 °C). Such AgFeO2 NPs were used as heterogeneous catalysts to activate peroxymonosulfate (PMS) for the removal of Orange I (OI) in the water. External water conditions effects and the stability of AgFeO2 NPs were investigated. The catalytic performance of AgFeO2 NPs was found to be significantly enhanced with the increasing content of 2H-AgFeO2. 1O2, O2•-, SO4•-, and •OH were identified as the dominating reactive oxygen species (ROSs) participated in the catalytic process. The electron transfer of Ag0/Ag+ and Fe2+/Fe3+ cycles facilitated the decomposition of PMS to generate ROSs. The surface hydroxyl groups (-OH) were regarded as the catalytic active sites. The higher 2H-AgFeO2 content in AgFeO2 NPs promoted the concentration of surface hydroxyl groups ( C-OH) and the reactivity of AgFeO2 NPs for PMS activation. Based on theoretical calculations, the 2H-AgFeO2 (004) plane with more Fe sites was more conducive to binding with the -OH compared to the 3R-AgFeO2 (012) plane, ascribed to the stronger adsorption energy and shorter Fe-O bond length between 2H-AgFeO2 and -OH.",A Comparison between the Oil Removal Capacity of Polymer-Coated Magnetic Nanoparticles in Natural and Synthetic Environmental Samples.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30888155,Environmental science & technology,2019 04 16,"Oil spills can have dramatic impacts on the environment. The limitations of current oil remediation techniques have inspired researchers to study the application of nanotechnology for oil cleanup. Previously, we reported essentially 100% removal of a reference MC252 oil using polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)-coated iron oxide nanoparticles (NPs) from oil-water mixtures under a wide range of environmentally relevant conditions. Our previous results showed that in the synthetic water samples, the concentration of cations and natural organic macromolecules (NOM) can significantly affect the oil removal efficiency of NPs. Here, we studied the application of these NPs for oil removal from natural freshwater samples and compared the results with the synthetic water samples with the same concentrations of major ions and NOM. For both natural and synthetic samples, concentrations of NOM, calcium, and magnesium were positively correlated with oil removal ( p-value <0.05). NPs show an average of 30% higher oil removal efficiency from natural samples compared to the synthetic samples. Using up to 50 ppm of NP, essentially 100% oil removal was observed under most conditions specially hardwater samples (initial 0.15 g L-1 oil concentration). Results show that these NPs are a facile and reliable technique for removing oil under realistic conditions.",Alkali-Metal-Mediated Synergistic Effects in Polar Main Group Organometallic Chemistry.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30888154,Chemical reviews,2019 06 11,"The development of synthetic chemistry since the early 1900s owes much to the service of organolithium reagents. Brilliant bases (e.g., deprotonating C-H bonds), nucleophiles (e.g., adding to unsaturated molecules), and transfer agents (e.g., delivering ligands to other metals), these versatile virtuosi and to a lesser extent the organic derivatives of the other common alkali metals sodium and potassium have proved indispensable in both academia and technology. Today these monometallic compounds are still utilized widely in synthetic campaigns, but in recent years they have been joined by an assortment of bimetallic formulations that also contain an alkali metal but in company with another metal. These bimetallic formulations often exhibit unique chemistry that can be interpreted in terms of synergistic effects, for which the alkali metal is essential, though it is often the second metal that performs the synthetic transformation. Here, this ""alkali-metal-mediated"" chemistry is surveyed focusing mainly on bimetallic formulations containing two alkali metals or an alkali metal paired with magnesium, calcium, zinc, aluminum, or gallium.

Here, we present the first demonstration on the single particle collision that can be developed for the detection of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), an important protein involved in the central nervous system in living rat brain. The system features Pt nanoparticles (PtNPs) conjugated with the PDGF recognition aptamer, suppressing the electrocatalytic collision of PtNPs toward the oxidation of hydrazine. In the presence of PDGF, the stronger binding between targeted protein and the aptamer disrupts the aptamer/PtNPs conjugates, recovering the electrocatalytic performance of PtNPs, and allowing quantitative, selective, and highly sensitive detection of PDGF in cerebrospinal fluid of rat brain.",Strain-Level Differentiation of Bacteria by Paper Spray Ionization Mass Spectrometry.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30888152,Analytical chemistry,2019 06 10,"Paper spray ionization mass spectrometry (PSI-MS) is a relatively new analytical technique allowing for rapid mass spectrometric analysis of biological samples with little or no sample preparation. The expeditious nature of the analysis and minimal requirement for sample preparation make PSI-MS a promising avenue for future clinical assays with one potential application in the identification of different types of bacteria. Although past PSI-MS studies have demonstrated the ability to distinguish between bacteria of different species and morphological classes, achieving within-species strain-level differentiation has never been performed. In this report, we demonstrate the first strain-level bacterial differentiation by PSI-MS with the mammalian intestinal bacterium Oxalobacter formigenes ( Oxf). This novel application holds promising clinical significance as it could be used to differentiate between pathogenic bacteria and their harmless, commensal relatives, saving time and money in clinical diagnostics. Both whole cells and cell lysates of  Oxf strains HC1 and OxWR were analyzed using the Prosolia Velox 360TM PSI source coupled to a Thermo Scientific Q Exactive high-resolution mass spectrometer with a rapid 30 s analytical method. Multivariate statistical analysis followed by examination of significant features provided for and confirmed differentiation between Oxf HC1 and OxWR.

However, less attention has been focused on the study of the capacitive mechanism of electrochemically active surface oxygen groups rooted in porous carbons. Herein, the degree and variety of oxygen surface groups of HNO3-modified samples (N-CS) are finely tailored by a mild hydrothermal oxidation (0.0-3.0 mol L-1), while the micro-meso-macroporous structures are efficiently preserved from the original sample. Thus, N-CS is a suitable carrier for separately discussing the contribution of oxygen functional groups to the electrochemical property. The optimized N-CS shows a high capacitance of 279.4 F g-1 at 1 A g-1, exceeding 52.8% of pristine carbon sphere (CS) (182.8 F g-1 at 1 A g-1) in KOH electrolyte. On further deconvoluting the redox peaks of cyclic voltammetry curves, we find that the pseudocapacitance not only associates with the surface-controlled faradic reaction at high scan rate but also dramatically stems from the diffusion-controlled capacitance through potassium and hydroxyl ion insertion/deinsertion into the underutilized micropores at low scan rate. The assembled supercapacitor based on N-CS presents a stable energy density of 5 Wh kg-1 over a wide range of power density of 250-5000 W kg-1, which is higher than 0.0N-CS in KOH electrolyte. In TEABF4 electrolyte, the N-CS supercapacitor has an energy density of 26.9 Wh kg-1 at the power density of 1350 W kg-1 and exhibits excellent cycling stability with a capacitance retention of 93.2% at 2 A g-1 after 10 000 cycles.

In this work, a novel antifouling electrochemical immunosensor was explored based on the self-assembly of two kinds of poly( N-isopropylacrylamide) microgels on the surface of graphene oxide for sensitive detection of streptomycin (STR). The microgels modified with glycidyl methacrylate (GMA) and zwitterionic liquid 1-propyl-3-vinylimidazole sulfonate (PVIS) were prepared. The microgels with GMA were used by combining specific recognition of anti-STR. The rapid specific binding of antigen and anti-STR resulted in a decrease of current density to generate electrochemical responsive signals. Zwitterionic liquid-modified microgels were used for antifouling, which can form stronger hydration and show excellent antifouling ability. As a result, we achieved efficient and sensitive detection of STR in the complex sample with evidently resisted nonspecific adsorption effect, the wide linear range toward STR was from 0.05 to 100 ng mL-1, with a detection limit down to 1.7 pg mL-1. The immunosensor based on the surface functionalization of microgels showed promising applications for the detection of antibiotics in complex media."

The impact of anxiety, low health literacy, asymmetric information and inadequate communication between patients and health care providers, family pressures, rational apathy by health care providers, cognitive biases of both patients and health care providers, and other factors make it quite difficult for patients in these circumstances to process and comprehend the strategic uncertainty and resultant risks and benefits of, and alternatives to, whatever therapeutic or life-prolonging treatment physicians are offering. All of these factors render the classic goal of ""informed consent"" unachievable in all but the rarest of circumstances: The effort to discuss and evaluate strategic uncertainty, its rational reduction into risks and benefits, and alternatives of treatment for purposes of optimizing decisional outcomes will have genuine intrinsic value only for ultra-rational patients (and physicians). In addition to these alterable barriers to rational decision-making--i.e., barriers that can, in theory, be overcome by ultra-rational patients and physicians with sufficient time and persistent inquiry--there is a second decision-making realm in which the added complexities of bounded rationality, clinical uncertainty and, in particular, of overall Knightian uncertainty provide insurmountable, unalterable barriers to confident rational decision-making. Within this more fundamental human realm of irreducible uncertainty, even ultra-rational, good-Bayesian decision-makers can never confidently calculate a highest-utility treatment option. In order to better describe this secondary realm of unalterable barriers to rational patient choice, including its usually subversive effect on end-of-life decisional behavior, by both average, minimally-rational patients and ultrarational patients, we coin the terms ""rational patient apathy"" and, relatedly, ""rational patient ignorance."" Given that confronting the absolute uncertainty inherent in facing one's mortality is cognitively, psychologically and emotionally daunting, and thus largely left unexplored and unpracticed by most patients for most of their healthier decisional lives, rational patient apathy at the sudden onset of a serious or life-threatening illness overwhelmingly defaults to negative decision-making: an affirmative choice to not make any balanced decision on the merits but rather to remain rationally ignorant of some or all aspects of the choice situation. In the context of this persistent patient avoidance of substantive decision-making, empirical evidence demonstrates frequent reversion to a quantity-over-quality approach, allowing health care providers to ""do everything"" until continued medical intervention reaches the point of obvious medical or economic futility. As a result—and as a largely discounted trade-off of choosing to avoid decisional burdens through non-careful consideration or no consideration at all—the overwhelming result of rational patient apathy in end-of-life decision-making is an irrational calculation and decision unto itself. Not only does rational patient apathy negate the classic (and utopian) goal of informed consent, it also exerts tremendous costs--on patients, on loved ones, on health care providers and on society at-large--in terms of adverse effects, avoidable suffering, constantly recurring decisional commitment costs, and the wasting of scarce economic resources.",To Freeze or Not to Freeze? An Update on Fertility Preservation In Females with Turner Syndrome.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30888127,Pediatric endocrinology reviews : PER,2019 06 13,"Introduction Infertility is a major concern for females with Turner syndrome (TS), regardless of their age. While fertility preservation is now routinely offered to girls and young women with cancer, there are currently no recommendations on fertility preservation in girls and young women with TS who generally face an even higher risk for infertility. Despite the lack of international guidelines, preservation procedures have been performed experimentally in females with TS. Methods A systematic literature search based on the PRISMA-P methodology for systematic reviews was performed in order to collect all published data on fertility preservation options in females with TS between January 1980 and April 2018. A total number of 67 records were included in this review. The records were screened for information regarding cryopreservation of mature oocytes and ovarian tissue in females with TS. Two ongoing trials on fertility preservation in young females with TS were also included. Results Cryopreservation of oocytes or ovarian tissue has been performed experimentally in >150 girls and adolescents with TS over the last 16 years. The efficacy of fertility preservation options in females with TS is still unknown due to the lack of follow-up data. Conclusion The efficacy of fertility preservation procedures in females with TS is still unknown. Future studies with focus on efficacy, safety and long-term follow-up are desperately needed.",Enhanced Understanding of the Natural History of Pre-Type 1 Diabetes: Fundamental to Prevention.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30888126,Pediatric endocrinology reviews : PER,2019 06 13,"Due to well-designed studies of birth cohorts and at-risk individuals, our understanding of the natural history of pre- and early type 1 diabetes (T1D) has advanced considerably over the past decade.

Herein, we systematically review previously reported AME cases in the pediatric population, focusing on presentation, genetic basis, treatment and outcomes. We demonstrate a negative correlation between the ratio of urinary cortisol to cortisone metabolites, and the age of diagnosis (p=0.0051). We also report a novel causative variant of the 11β-HSD2 gene and propose an explanation for failure of the mineralocorticoid receptor antogonist, spironolactone, to control hypertension and hypokalemia in a subgroup of patients.",Genetic Tumor Syndromes with Endocrine Involvement: A Compendium and an Update.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30888124,Pediatric endocrinology reviews : PER,2019 06 13,"Many hereditary and sporadic tumor and other syndromes are associated with endocrine functional and or structural abnormalities.

We analyzed 263 patients from the AGMT CLL-8a Mabtenance trial for the impact of obesity. The trial included patients after rituximab-containing induction treatment in first or second line that had achieved at least a PR. A randomization to rituximab maintenance treatment (375 mg/m2 q3 months for 2 years) vs observation was performed. In this cohort 22% of the patients (58/263) were classified as obese. The baseline response to induction treatment was inferior in obese patients with a lower CR rate (43.1% vs 60.5% in obese vs non-obese, P = 0.018) and with a lower rate of patients achieving MRD negativity after chemoimmunotherapy induction treatment (19.6% vs 35.8%, P = 0.02). The PFS outcome of obese patients was significantly worse in the observation group of the trial (24 vs 39 months median PFS, P = 0.03). However, in the rituximab maintenance group the outcome for obese vs non-obese was not different (P = 0.4). In summary, obesity was overall associated with a worse outcome of chemoimmunotherapy induction. However, rituximab maintenance treatment seems to be able to overcome this negative effect."

In 2008, a National Mental Health Plan (NMHP) was approved to provide policy guidance over the transition period. The NMHP intended, among others, to develop community-based services, with a specific focus on rehabilitation and deinstitutionalization. This study aims to explore the perspectives of service managers of psychosocial rehabilitation services regarding the main challenges to support the community living of persons with severe mental illnesses (PWSMI) in the Lisbon Metropolitan Area (LMA). The paper also contextualises the provision of psychosocial services within the country's mental health reform process and characterises the profile of service users in socio-occupational units (SOUs) of the LMA. Semi-structured interviews were performed with all SOUs' managers of the LMA (n = 13). Information regarding service user characteristics was collected based on service records (n = 344). Interviews were analysed according to the framework methodology. The results of the interviews were triangulated using document analysis. Fieldwork took place between June and July 2016. The findings suggest that the development of the mental health reform ensured significant changes to service delivery. Community-based mental health organisations are an important actor for service provision. However, important asymmetries were identified in the provision of psychosocial care within the LMA. At the same time, family carers are perceived as responsible for ensuring a large part of the social needs of the PWSMI but there is an increasing concern with their own ageing processes. As a conclusion, it is highlighted the current inequality between services and the need to contemplate a life-course perspective that comprehends the ageing process of caregivers poses an emerging challenge for psychosocial rehabilitation. These findings are also important for other low- and middle-income countries passing through similar reforms.","11q24.2q24.3 microdeletion in two families presenting features of Jacobsen syndrome, without intellectual disability: Role of FLI1, ETS1, and SENCR long noncoding RNA.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30888095,American journal of medical genetics. Part A,2019 04 29,"This report presents two families with interstitial 11q24.2q24.3 deletion, associated with malformations, hematologic features, and typical facial dysmorphism, observed in Jacobsen syndrome (JS), except for intellectual disability (ID). The smallest 700 Kb deletion contains only two genes: FLI1 and ETS1, and a long noncoding RNA, SENCR, narrowing the minimal critical region for some features of JS. Consistent with recent literature, it adds supplemental data to confirm the crucial role of FLI1 and ETS1 in JS, namely FLI1 in thrombocytopenia and ETS1 in cardiopathy and immune deficiency. It also supports that combined ETS1 and FLI1 haploinsufficiency explains dysmorphic features, notably ears, and nose anomalies. Moreover, it raises the possibility that SENCR, a long noncoding RNA, could be responsible for limb defects, because of its early role in endothelial cell commitment and function. Considering ID and autism spectrum disorder, which are some of the main features of JS, a participation of ETS1, FLI1, or SENCR cannot be excluded. But, considering the normal neurodevelopment of our patients, their role would be either minor or with an important variability in penetrance. Furthermore, according to literature, ARHGAP32 and KIRREL3 seem to be the strongest candidate genes in the 11q24 region for other Jacobsen patients.",Integrating preparation for care trajectory management into nurse education: Competencies and pedagogical strategies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30888094,Nursing inquiry,2019 03 19,Nurses make an important contribution to the organisation and coordination of patient care but receive little formal educational preparation for this work.

In addition to improvement in glycaemic control, glucose-lowering therapies, such as glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) and sodium-dependent glucose cotransporter (SGLT)-2 inhibitors, have been shown to significantly reduce CV events. In 2008, the US Food and Drug Administration mandated that all new glucose-lowering drugs undergo CV outcomes trials (CVOTs) to determine their CV safety. These trials have largely demonstrated no major CV safety concerns. Most notably, the GLP-1RAs and SGLT-2 inhibitors have been found to be not only safe, but also cardioprotective compared to placebo. The SGLT-2 inhibitors have opened a new perspective for clinicians treating patients with T2D and established CV disease in light of their 'pleiotropic' effects, specifically on heart failure, while GLP-1RAs seem to present more favourable effects on atherosclerotic events. In this review, we discuss the role of GLP-1RAs and SGLT-2 inhibitors to reduce CV risk in T2D patients and suggest an individualized therapeutic approach in this population based on the presence of metabolic and CV comorbidities.",Assenting to exposedness - meanings of receiving assisted bodily care in a nursing home as narrated by older persons.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30888087,Scandinavian journal of caring sciences,2019 03 19,"Most older persons moving to a nursing home need to receive assisted bodily care, which means being in a position of vulnerability. However, few studies have explicitly focused on the meanings of receiving assisted bodily care from the older persons' perspective. This study aimed to elucidate meanings of receiving assisted bodily care, as narrated by older persons living in a nursing home. Twelve men and women, aged 80 or older, living in a Swedish nursing home, participated in the study. Data were generated by narrative interviews and analysed with a phenomenological-hermeneutical method. The regional ethics committee approved the study. In the analysis, one main theme emerged: 'Assenting to exposedness'. This theme comprised five themes, 'To have hope in hopelessness', 'To relinquish one's body into others' hands', 'To be between power and powerlessness', 'To oscillate between one's own responsibility and demands', 'To be in an ongoing interaction', and ten subthemes. In conclusion, receiving assisted bodily care means to be exposed, but not passively. Rather, it means to be self-determinant for as long as possible, to perceive the body as lived. When the body must be relinquished to others, it might be objectified, leading to care-suffering. To avoid this, the older persons use a certain competence, acquired through life, to decide when to take action or when to assent. However, this is but one of the several possible interpretations, which may be considered a limitation.",Recipient's effects on stored red blood cell performance: the case of uremic plasma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30888086,Transfusion,2019 06 04,"Despite universal administration of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) are at high risk for presenting persistent anemia.

Identifying predictors of such sequelae would provide a management reference for IH lesions and help achieve favorable outcomes. Our objective is to explore the correlation between volumetric residue remaining after IH involution and its location and to identify other potential outcome predictors. All IH patients examined at our hospital from 2008 to 2011 were reviewed, and both the degree of volumetric residue after involution and the quantified degree of sequelae were obtained by comparing follow-up photographs with photographs of lesions at their maximum size. We discovered that for children with a defined age at the initial visit, lesions of the perifacial area achieved significantly more volumetric regression than lesions of the central facial (P < 0.0001) and chest areas (P = 0.0002). Perifacial lesions had a significantly higher aesthetic score than those on the central facial area (P < 0.0001), chest (P < 0.0001) and trunk/extremities (P = 0.0226) when the age at initial visit and lesion type were consistent. Our study reveals that lesion location and age at initial visit are contributing factors to volumetric sequelae and the aesthetics of the lesion after involution. The results of this study provide a reference to guide treatment decisions with the aim of achieving a favorable outcome.",Functions and roles of long noncoding RNA in cholangiocarcinoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30888066,Journal of cellular physiology,2019 03 19,"Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is one of the most fatal cancers in humans, with a gradually increasing incidence worldwide. The efficient diagnostic and therapeutic measures for CCA to reduce mortality are urgently needed. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) may provide the potential diagnostic and therapeutic option for suppressing the CCA development. LncRNAs are a type of non-protein-coding RNAs, which are larger than 200 nucleotides in length. Increasing evidence reveals that lncRNAs exhibit critical roles in the carcinogenesis and development of CCA. Deregulation of lncRNAs impacts the proliferation, migration, invasion, and antiapoptosis of CCA cells by multiple sophisticated mechanisms. Consequently, lncRNAs likely represent promising biomarkers or intervention targets of CCA. In this review, we summarize current studies regarding the biological functions and regulatory mechanisms of diverse lncRNAs in CCA.",Role of SCFAs in gut microbiome and glycolysis for colorectal cancer therapy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30888065,Journal of cellular physiology,2019 03 19,"Increased risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) is associated with altered intestinal microbiota as well as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) reduction of output The energy source of colon cells relies mainly on three SCFAs, namely butyrate (BT), propionate, and acetate, while CRC transformed cells rely mainly on aerobic glycolysis to provide energy. This review summarizes recent research results for dysregulated glucose metabolism of SCFAs, which could be initiated by gut microbiome of CRC. Moreover, the relationship between SCFA transporters and glycolysis, which may correlate with the initiation and progression of CRC, are also discussed. Additionally, this review explores the linkage of BT to transport of SCFAs expressions between normal and cancerous colonocyte cell growth for tumorigenesis inhibition in CRC. Furthermore, the link between gut microbiota and SCFAs in the metabolism of CRC, in addition, the proteins and genes related to SCFAs-mediated signaling pathways, coupled with their correlation with the initiation and progression of CRC are also discussed. Therefore, targeting the SCFA transporters to regulate lactate generation and export of BT, as well as applying SCFAs or gut microbiota and natural compounds for chemoprevention may be clinically useful for CRCs treatment. Future research should focus on the combination these therapeutic agents with metabolic inhibitors to effectively target the tumor SCFAs and regulate the bacterial ecology for activation of potent anticancer effect, which may provide more effective application prospect for CRC therapy.","Dental microwear texture analysis of Homo sapiens sapiens: Foragers, farmers, and pastoralists.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30888064,American journal of physical anthropology,2019 05 10,"The current study seeks to determine if a sample of foragers, farmers, and pastoralists are distinguishable based on their dental microwear texture signatures.","Characterization of uropathogenic E. coli O25b-B2-ST131, O15:K52:H1, and CGA: Neutrophils apoptosis, serum bactericidal assay, biofilm formation, and virulence typing.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30888063,Journal of cellular physiology,2019 03 19,"Pathogenic and drug-resistant strains of Escherichia coli (E. coli) O25b-B2-ST131, O15:H1-D-ST393, and CGA (clonal group A) clonal groups have spread worldwide.

Classical A-T is caused by biallelic variants on ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated) gene, leading to a loss of function of the protein kinase ATM, involved in DNA damage repair. Atypical presentations can be found in A-T-like disease or in Nijmegen breakage syndrome, caused by deficiency of mre11 or nibrin proteins, respectively.

During the Wiltse approach, it is sometimes necessary to resect some of the facet or pars interarticularis to achieve an adequate exposure. The endoscopic transforaminal route can be of benefit in far lateral disk herniations due to direct access to the epidural space through Kambin's triangle, without the need for any bony removal or nerve retraction. In this video, we describe a percutaneous endoscopic transforaminal approach for far lateral discectomy in a patient presenting with a left L4 radiculopathy due to a far lateral L4-5 disk herniation. We describe Kambin's triangle anatomy and its relevance to the transforaminal route. The steps of the procedure are then described: dissection of soft tissue and removal of free disk fragments on the inferior aspect of the foramen far from the compressed exiting nerve route above to decrease the risk of retraction injury, gentle maneuvering of endoscope superiorly with removal of further compressive disk fragments, exposure of the exiting nerve root superiorly after adequate decompression is achieved and removal of any remaining fragments in close proximity to the nerve, and finally evaluation of traversing nerve root for any compressive lesions.

We applied excitatory and inhibitory transcranial direct current stimulation over a region of the left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex previously found to encode the reliability of both learning systems. The opposing neural interventions resulted in a bidirectional shift of control between MB and MF learning. Stimulation also affected the sensitivity of the arbitration mechanism itself, as it changed how often subjects switched between the dominant system over time. Both of these effects depended on varying task contexts that either favored MB or MF control, indicating that this arbitration mechanism is not context-invariant but flexibly incorporates information about current environmental demands.","Association Between Tumor Compartment Volumes, the Incidence of Pretreatment Seizures, and Statin-Mediated Protective Effects in Glioblastoma.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30888031,Neurosurgery,2019 03 19,"Seizures are a common initial symptom of malignant brain tumors such as glioblastoma (GBM).

For the five nucleobases, adenine, thymine, cytosine, guanine, and uracil, surprisingly high fusion temperatures and enthalpies have been measured using a specially developed fast scanning calorimetry method that prevents decomposition. Even when nucleobases admittedly possess very high fusion temperatures, e.g. the value of 862 K measured for guanine really exceeds all expectations of the feasible dimension of the fusion temperature for such a relatively small and simple organic molecule. Hirshfeld surface analysis has been applied in order to find out an explanation for such extremely unusual thermal behavior of nucleobases. We rationalized the observed trends in terms of fusion entropy (Walden's constant = 56.5 J K-1 mol-1) as the entropic penalty of fusion not only for ""non-associated"", as proposed by Walden in 1908, but also for ""ideal associated"" systems like nucleobases.",Correction: Peptide-directed encapsulation of inorganic nanoparticles into protein containers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30888009,Nanoscale,2019 06 10,"Correction for 'Peptide-directed encapsulation of inorganic nanoparticles into protein containers' by Tobias Beck et al., Nanoscale, 2018, 10, 22917-22926.",Acid/base- and base/acid-switchable complexation between anionic-/cationic-pillar[6]arenes and a viologen ditosylate salt.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30888007,Organic & biomolecular chemistry,2019 05 09,"Two new host-guest complexes between water-soluble anionic pillar[6]arene (WP6) or cationic pillar[6]arene (CP6) and a viologen ditosylate salt G·2TsO were constructed, among which one formed from WP6 and G2+ ions can be controlled by the sequential addition of an acid and a base (HCl and NaOH, respectively), whereas the other fabricated from CP6 and TsO- ions can be switched through the sequential addition of basic and acidic reagents (NaOH and HCl, respectively).",An oxygen-bridged triarylamine polycyclic unit based tris-cyclometalated heteroleptic iridium(iii) complex: correlation between the structure and photophysical properties.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30888006,"Dalton transactions (Cambridge, England : 2003)",2019 04 05,"A novel oxygen-bridged triarylamine polycyclic unit based tris-cyclometalated heteroleptic iridium(iii) complex (Ir-NO) has been designed and prepared. Similar iridium(iii) complexes (Ir-N and Ir-O) have also been prepared for comparison. The single crystal structure indicates that the oxygen-bridged triarylamine polycyclic unit of Ir-NO shows certain planarity, resulting in obvious rigidity and interesting π-π stacking. Additionally, Ir-NO shows a larger redshift emission (586 nm) and a longer emission lifetime (628 ns) than Ir-N (525 nm, 344 ns) and Ir-O (543 nm, 436 ns), and the phosphorescence color can be tuned from green to orange.

Most existing conjugated fluorophores exhibit excellent light-emitting performance in dilute solutions, but their properties substantially decrease or even completely vanish due to severe aggregation quenching in the solid state. Herein, we synthesize a series of triazolopyridine-thiophene donor-acceptor-donor (D-A-D) type conjugated molecules with high absolute fluorescence quantum yields (ΦF) ranging from 80% to 89% in solution. These molecules also show unusual light-emitting properties in the solid state with ΦF of up to 26%. We find that owing to the protonation-deprotonation process of the pyridine ring, these compounds display obvious changes in both fluorescence wavelength and intensity upon addition of acids, and these changes can be readily recovered by the successive introduction of bases. By harnessing this phenomenon, we further show that these fluorophores can be employed for efficient and reversible fluorescence sensing of hydrogen ions in a broad pH range (0.0-7.0). With the fabrication of pH testing papers and ink-printed complex patterns including butterflies and letters on substrates, we demonstrate the application of such sensors to fluorescence indication or solid state pH detection for real samples such as volatile acidic/basic gas and water-quality analysis.","Low linear energy transfer radiolysis of supercritical water at 400 °C: in situ generation of ultrafast, transient, density-dependent ""acid spikes"".",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30888004,Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP,2019 03 28,"There is growing interest in the radiation chemistry of supercritical water (SCW), as its use as a coolant in a nuclear reactor (Generation IV) is the logical evolution of the current (Generation III or less) water-cooled reactors. However, current knowledge about the potential effects of water radiolysis in a Gen-IV supercritical water-cooled reactor (SCWR) is incomplete. In this work, Monte Carlo track chemistry simulations of the low linear energy transfer (LET) radiolysis of SCW (H2O) at 400 °C are used in combination with a spherical ""spur"" model to study the effect of water density on the in situ radiolytic formation of H3O+ ions and the corresponding abrupt, transient, highly acidic pH response (""acid spikes"") that is observed immediately after irradiation. The magnitude and duration of this acidic pH effect depend on the water density in the considered range of 0.15-0.6 g cm-3. It is strongest at times less than a few tens of picoseconds with the pH remaining nearly constant at ∼1.6 and 1.9 for the highest (""liquid-like"") and lowest (""gas-like"") density, respectively. At longer times, the pH gradually increases for all densities and finally reaches a constant value corresponding to the non-radiolytic, pre-irradiation concentration of H3O+, due to the autoprotolysis of water. Our results show that the lower the density of the water, the longer the time required to reach this constant value, ranging from ∼50 ns at 0.6 g cm-3 (pH ∼ 5.6) to ∼1 μs at 0.15 g cm-3 (pH ∼ 8.5).

Recently, a unique UV-induced response of 6MeAde was reported, which makes it instructive and intriguing to reveal the excited state relaxation mechanism in this methylated adenine and its derivatives. In this work, we investigated 6MeAde and its ribose species N6-methyladenosine (6MeAdo) by using femtosecond time-resolved fluorescence up-conversion (FUC) and broadband transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy. Both 6MeAde and 6MeAdo exhibit a hundreds of femtoseconds lifetime, which originates from the efficient depletion of the ππ* (La) state. A several picoseconds lifetime is also observed and it should be attributed to the ππ* (Lb) state. Surprisingly, dual peak fluorescence emission is observed in 6MeAde and the long wavelength emission is ascribed to an intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) state. The lifetime of this ICT state is determined to be 107 ps. The kinetic isotope effect shows that the ICT state is closely associated with the solute-solvent H-bonding in aqueous solution. In 6MeAdo, the ICT state is apparently quenched and adenine-like excited state dynamics suggests that DNA/RNA containing such modification could still possess excellent photostability under UV irradiation.

At potential 1.8 V, only Am(v) is observed, while increasing the potential to as much as 2.0 V, results in oxidation of Am(iii) to Am(v) and subsequent oxidation of Am(v) to Am(vi). At applied potentials >2.0 V, Am(iii) is oxidized to Am(v), while Am(vi) is reduced to Am(v). The latter reduction reaction is likely due to the increased rate of hydrogen peroxide formation from the 2-electron oxidation of water at the electrode at these high potentials.

Here we examine the electronic and structural properties and the thermodynamic stability of functionalised silicene/4 × 4 Ag(111) using density functional theory calculations coupled with ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations. We focus on 11 functional groups, namely phenyl, methyl, hydroxyl, cyano, methoxyl, amino and ethylmethylamine, in addition to 4 halogen atoms. These functional groups are shown to endow the Si/Ag(111) surface with a large variation in the work function. Our AIMD simulations confirm the thermodynamic stability of these 11 functionalised structures. This work shows the possibility of tuning the electronic structure of silicene by functionalisation, which could then be utilized in polymer solar cells and nanoelectronic circuit components.","Regioselective three-component synthesis of 1,2-diarylindoles from cyclohexanones, α-hydroxyketones and anilines under transition-metal-free conditions.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30887978,"Chemical communications (Cambridge, England)",2019 04 05,"A facile method for the one-pot synthesis of 1,2-diarylindoles under transition-metal-free conditions is described.

M. Müller et al. [Angew. Chem., Int. Ed., 1998, 37, 505-507] that the product (tachysterol) had rotated not only its central double bond but also an adjacent single bond. This is called a Hula twist (HT) due to the alternative description, in which it is just one central CH group that rotates. It was pointed out that the results directly support the calculated molecular structure at a conical intersection, which mediates the Z-E isomerization of polyenes. With a more sophisticated technique, Saltiel et al. (J. Phys. Chem. Lett., 2013, 4, 716-721) confirmed this tachysterol rotamer as the main product but found two additional conformers. They believed to have seen also three previtamin D conformers, suggested to be a result of hot-ground-state reactions from the primary rotamer, and interpreted all tachysterol products to be a result of a double-bond twist (DBT), not a HT. On the basis of published circular dichroism data and consideration of other reactions, it is here shown that under these conditions hot-ground-state reactions are unimportant or even negligible and that there is practically only a single conformer of previtamin D after ring opening. All products can be easily understood on the basis of an HT-type conical intersection, which is thus further supported. Invoking a published pretwist model even rationalizes product ratios. The two twists in HT are concerted. Furthermore HT is fully consistent with the NEER principle (nonequilibration of excited rotamers) and even offers additional possibilities for conformer control.",High electroactive material loading on a carbon nanotube/carbon nanofiber as an advanced free-standing electrode for asymmetric supercapacitors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30887976,"Chemical communications (Cambridge, England)",2019 04 05,"3D hierarchical nanocomposites always lead to excellent electrochemical properties.

Further, our detailed studies indicate that the concentration of surfactant required for the sequestration of a drug is less than its critical micellar concentration (CMC). The extent of sequestration of drug by polymer-surfactant supramolecular assemblies can be tuned finely by controlling the concentration of surfactant.

We characterize the adhesion forces and dissect the influence of intermolecular interactions by probing the adhesion forces of single cells on different model substrates with tailored properties. Our experiments show that the flagella-mediated adhesion of Chlamydomonas to surfaces is largely substrate independent, enabling the cell to adhere to any type of surface. This universal adhesion mechanism allows the microalga to effectively colonize abiotic surfaces in their heterogeneous natural habitats.

Mutations in the chloride channel accessory 4 (CLCA4) gene have been shown to have a role in male infertility. The aim of this study was to investigate the associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the CLCA4 gene and NOA in a Chinese Han population of Northeast China using combined targeted gene capture next-generation sequencing and bioinformatics analysis. MATERIAL AND METHODS The study group included 100 men with NOA, and there were 100 normal controls. Targeted gene capture next-generation sequencing was performed combined with bioinformatics analysis. Ten CLCA4 SNPs were screened in the cases of NOA and control subjects. The associations between SNPs and NOA were analyzed. RESULTS Six SNPs, c.390C>T (rs190628533), c.1474A>G (rs2231599), c.2105C>G (rs757773924), c.2371A>T) (rs759981524), c.956G>A (rs763334876), and c.895T>C (rs79822589) were identified in the study group of cases in NOA but not in control subjects. All CLCA4 SNPs were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The allele and genotype frequencies of the six SNPs were not significantly different between the study group and the controls. Haplotype analysis showed the existence of two haplotypes, CTAGACTACG and CTCGACTACG, which showed statistical significance of 0.074, and 0.088 between cases of NOA and the controls, respectively. CONCLUSIONS There were no significant associations between CLCA4 SNPs and NOA in men in a Chinese Han population of Northeast China.","External validation of postnatal gestational age estimation using newborn metabolic profiles in Matlab, Bangladesh.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30887951,eLife,2019 03 29,"This study sought to evaluate the performance of metabolic gestational age estimation models developed in Ontario, Canada in infants born in Bangladesh. Cord and heel prick blood spots were collected in Bangladesh and analyzed at a newborn screening facility in Ottawa, Canada. Algorithm-derived estimates of gestational age and preterm birth were compared to ultrasound-validated estimates. 1036 cord blood and 487 heel prick samples were collected from 1069 unique newborns. The majority of samples (93.2% of heel prick and 89.9% of cord blood) were collected from term infants. When applied to heel prick data, algorithms correctly estimated gestational age to within an average deviation of 1 week overall (root mean square error = 1.07 weeks). Metabolic gestational age estimation provides accurate population-level estimates of gestational age in this data set. Models were effective on data obtained from both heel prick and cord blood, the latter being a more feasible option in low-resource settings.",Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing of Leptospira spp. in the Lao People's Democratic Republic Using Disk Diffusion.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30887950,The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene,2019 05 05,"Leptospirosis is a global zoonotic disease caused by pathogenic bacteria of the Leptospira genus, which are fastidious, slow-growing organisms. Antimicrobial susceptibility data are limited; traditionally, the organisms have not been culturable on solid media. The recent development of Leptospira Vanaporn Wuthiekanun (LVW) agar, which facilitates rapid growth of Leptospira spp., provides the opportunity for antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Eighty-three Leptospira spp. clinical isolates originating from patients in Laos between 2006 and 2016 were tested against six antimicrobials (azithromycin, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, doxycycline, gentamicin, and penicillin G) using disk diffusion on LVW agar. Quality control was undertaken using American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) reference strains with known susceptibilities on both standard media and LVW agar. All Leptospira spp. isolates produced large zones of inhibition around each of the six antimicrobials. All zones were greater than 25 mm: gentamicin produced the smallest zones (median 35 mm; interquartile range 30 mm-37 mm) and azithromycin produced the largest zones (median 85 mm; interquartile range 85 mm-85 mm). Zones produced by non-leptospiral ATCC reference strains on LVW agar were within 2 mm of accepted strain-specific quality control range on standard media. Antimicrobial activity on LVW agar appears to be similar to that on standard media. As there are no published susceptibility guidelines for the Leptospira genus, zone interpretation was subjective. Leptospira Vanaporn Wuthiekanun agar enabled antimicrobial susceptibility testing of multiple Leptospira isolates on solid media; the large zone sizes observed suggest that resistance has not emerged to these six antimicrobials in Lao Leptospira spp.",Vector Competence for West Nile Virus and St. Louis Encephalitis Virus (Flavivirus) of Three Tick Species of the Genus Amblyomma (Acari: Ixodidae).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30887949,The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene,2019 05 05,"Many species of Amblyomma ticks are commonly found infesting wild birds in South America, where birds are important hosts for several arboviruses, such as West Nile virus (WNV) and St. Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV). In this study, WNV and SLEV transmission experiments were performed to evaluate the vector competence of three South American tick species: Amblyomma ovale, Amblyomma tigrinum, and Amblyomma tonelliae. Larval and nymphal ticks of each species were allowed to feed on chicks needle inoculated with WNV or SLEV. All three Amblyomma species acquired either WNV or SLEV through larval feeding, with infection rates varying from 3.1% to 100% for WNV and from 0% to 35.7% for SLEV in engorged larvae. Transstadial perpetuation of the viruses was demonstrated in the molted nymphs, with WNV infection rates varying from 0% to 33.7% and SLEV infection rates from 13.6% to 23.8%. Although nymphal ticks also acquired either virus through feeding, transstadial perpetuation to adult ticks was lower, with virus detection in only 3.2% of A. tigrinum and 11.5% of A. tonelliae unfed adult ticks. On the other hand, vector competence for nymphs (exposed to WNV or SLEV through larval feeding) and adult ticks (exposed to WNV or SLEV through larval or nymphal feeding) was null in all cases. Although our results indicate transstadial perpetuation of WNV or SLEV in the three tick species, the ticks were not competent to transmit these agents to susceptible hosts. The role of these ixodid tick species in the epidemiology of WNV and SLEV might be insignificant, even though at least A. ovale and A. tigrinum are frequent bird ticks in Latin America, so the virus could survive winter in the fed larvae. However, future studies are required to determine the implications that this could have, as well as analyze the vector competence of other common bird tick species in South America.",Pathogen Lists Do Not Tell Us What We Need to Do.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30887948,The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene,2019 05 05,"Brett-Major and others remind us that pathogen lists for emerging infectious diseases aid in the development of tools that target specific pathogens (e.g., vaccines) and help attract financial support. These lists tell us what we need to have, not what we need to do. The authors call for more research on ways to prevent these diseases (e.g., platform technologies for vaccines) and mitigate disease impact. Vaccines and new treatments that target individual pathogens have many limitations. However, we might save lives by treating patients with inexpensive generic drugs that target common features of the host response to infection. Undertaking research on this approach to treatment is what we need to do."

Trimethylated histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27me3) is a repressive epigenetic marker that mediates tissue development. In this study, we demonstrate that H3K27me3 and histone methyl transferase Ezh2 regulated the development of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in vitro and in vivo. We found that H3K27me3 increased during differentiation of ventral midbrain-derived neural stem cells (VM-NSCs). However, histone demethylase selective inhibitor GSK-J1 increased H3K27me3 level and decreased the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase. Treated with Ezh2-selective inhibitor EPZ005687 repressed the trimethylation of H3K27 and enhanced differentiation of DA neurons in VM-NSCs cultures. Furthermore, Ezh2 inhibition promoted the expression of DA neurons developmental-related factors by modifying H3K27 trimethylation on the relevant promoter regions. Moreover, the effect of Ezh2 inhibition-mediated DA neurons differentiation was blocked by the expression of shRNA specific for Nurr1. In vivo, Ezh2 decreased and resulted in a reduction of H3K27me3 in developing midbrain. Deletion of Ezh2 by RNA interference approach promoted differentiation of DA neurons during midbrain development.

There is much evidence that diet and dietary factors play an important role in inflammation, and consequently pathogenesis of NAFLD. To investigate the role of diet in the development of inflammation, we can use the Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII), which has been shown to be predictive of levels of inflammatory markers. Methods: 295 incident cases were selected using the convenience-sampling procedure, and 704 controls randomly were selected from the same clinic and among the patients who had no hepatic steatosis and were frequency-matched on age (±5 years) and sex. The DII was computed based on dietary intake from 168-item FFQ. Logistic regression models were used to estimate multivariable ORs. Results: Subjects in tertile 3 had 1.57 (95% CI: 1.13-2.20), 1.78 (95% CI: 1.19-2.67), and 2.02 (95% CI: 1.32-3.09) times higher odds of developing NAFLD, compared to subjects in tertile 1 in models 1 (adjusted for age), 2 (model 1 + BMI, education, smoking, alcohol, diabetes, low density lipoprotein, triglycerides) and 3 (model 2 + aspartate transaminase/alanine transaminase), respectively.

However, studies investigating the biodynamic responses to vibration during training have used either mixed-gender subjects or male subjects. No study has investigated the effect of gender on the biodynamic responses under vibration training conditions. The objective of this study is to investigate the effect of gender on the apparent mass and the vibration of the head of standing people during exposure to vibration. A total of 40 subjects (20 females and 20 males) were exposed to vertical vibration at six frequencies in the range 20-45 Hz and vibration acceleration in the range 10.8-20.9 m/s2 (peak). The subjects stood on a force platform mounted on the vibrating plate of the machine adopting an upright standing posture with their knees unlocked and their arms straight along their bodies. The vertical acceleration and force at the interface between the vibrating plate and the feet were measured and used to calculate the apparent mass. The accelerations of the head in the x-, y- and z-directions were also measured and used to calculate the transmissibility to the head. The apparent mass of males was found higher than that of females. The transmissibility to the head in all directions was found higher in females than males.

Developing effective treatments for 'Ca. L. solanacearum' has been hampered by the difficulty in functionally characterizing the proteins of this organism, largely because they are not easily expressed and purified in standard expression systems. 'Ca. L. solanacearum' has a reduced genome and its proteins are predicted to be prone to instability and aggregation. Among intracellular-dwelling bacteria, chaperone proteins are conserved and overexpressed to buffer against problems in protein folding. We mimicked this approach for expressing and purifying 'Ca. L. solanacearum' proteins in Escherichia coli by coexpressing them with chaperones. Neither of the representative 'Ca. L. solanacearum' enzymes, dihydrodipicolinate synthase (key in lysine biosynthesis) and pyruvate kinase (involved in glycolysis), were overexpressed in standard E. coli expression plasmids or strains. However, soluble dihydrodipicolinate synthase was successfully coexpressed with GroEL/GroES, while soluble pyruvate kinase was successfully coexpressed with either GroEL/GroES, dnaK/dnaJ/grpE, or a trigger factor. Both enzymes, believed to be key proteins for the organism, were purified by a combination of affinity chromatography and size-exclusion chromatography. Additionally, both 'Ca. L. solanacearum' enzymes are active and have the canonical tetrameric oligomeric structure in solution, consistent with other bacterial orthologs. This is the first study to successfully isolate and functionally characterize proteins from 'Ca. L. solanacearum'. Thus, we provide a general strategy for characterizing its proteins, enabling new research and drug discovery programs to study and manage the pathogenicity of the organism.",Amputees Unanimous: A 12-step program.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30887887,Prosthetics and orthotics international,2019 06 07,"Alongside physical impairment, psychosocial health issues may arise after amputation, impacting quality of life.

Natural products and their derivatives having structural diversity are renowned source of therapeutic agents since many years. Tyrosol (a natural phenylethanoid) has been extracted from olive oil, and its structure was confirmed by elemental analysis, FT-IR, FT-NMR, and single crystal X-ray crystallography. The conformational analysis for tyrosol geometry was performed by Gaussian 09 in terms of density functional theory. Validation of bond lengths and bond angles obtained experimentally as well as theoretically were performed with the help of curve fitting analysis, and values of correlation coefficient (R) obtained as 0.988 and 0.984, respectively. The charge transfer within the tyrosol molecule was confirmed by analysis of HOMO→LUMO molecular orbitals. In molecular docking with COX-2 (PDB ID: 5F1A), tyrosol was found to possess satisfactory binding affinity as compared to other NSAIDs (Aspirin, Ibuprofen, and Naproxen) and a COX-2 selective drug (Celecoxib). ADMET prediction, drug-likeness and bioactivity score altogether confirm the lead/drug like potential of tyrosol. Further investigation of simulation quality plot, RMSD and RMSF plots, ligands behavior plot as well as post simulation analysis manifest the consistency of 5F1A-tyrosol complex throughout the 20 ns molecular simulation process that signifies its compactness and stability within the receptor pocket.

Meanwhile, with the aim of minimizing the input cost in practice, an optimization model is constructed to determine the optimal quantity of the predator released and the intensity of pesticide sprayed.

However, in the deep-sea hydrothermal vent tubeworm Riftia pachyptila (Vestimentifera, Siboglinidae), it has been suggested that the Candidatus Endoriftia persephone symbiont is monoclonal. Here, we show with high-coverage metagenomics that adult R. pachyptila house a polyclonal symbiont population consisting of one dominant and several low-frequency variants. This dominance of one genotype is confirmed by multilocus gene sequencing of amplified housekeeping genes in a broad range of host individuals where three out of four loci ( atpA, uvrD and recA) revealed no genomic differences, while one locus ( gyrB) was more diverse in adults than in juveniles. We also analysed a metagenome of free-living Endoriftia and found that the free-living population showed greater sequence variability than the host-associated population. Most juveniles and adults shared a specific dominant genotype, while other genotypes can dominate in few individuals. We suggest that although generally permissive, partner choice is selective enough to restrict uptake of some genotypes present in the environment.","Efficacy and safety of guselkumab, administered with a novel patient-controlled injector (One-Press), for moderate-to-severe psoriasis: results from the phase 3 ORION study.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30887876,The Journal of dermatological treatment,2019 03 19,"Guselkumab, an interleukin-23 antagonist, is approved for self-administration with the UltraSafe Plus™ syringe to treat moderate-to-severe plaque-type psoriasis.

In total, nine different vibrotactile stimulus frequencies (10-300 Hz) were utilized, and subjective evaluation methods, which involved adjectives, were used to assess the sensory representations of the participants (18 healthy male participants; mean age, 22.9 years; standard deviation, 3.5). Sensory terms such as 'slow,' 'protruding,' and 'thick' were used as representative expressions to describe low-frequency (10-100 Hz) vibrotactile stimulations, while 'fast,' 'shallow,' and 'tickly' were used to describe high-frequency (225-300 Hz) vibrotactile stimulations. At the frequencies of 150 and 200 Hz, no characteristic word was found because there was no difference in subjective evaluation scores from other low or high frequencies. The results suggest that vibrotactile stimulation at different frequencies induce diverse sensory representations, owing to not only the motion and shape of the stimuli but also the subjective responses of the perceivers. The results of this study could be utilized in developing affective haptic devices in the future.","The use of stromal vascular fraction (SVF), platelet-rich plasma (PRP) and stem cells in the treatment of osteoarthritis: an overview of clinical trials.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30887856,"Artificial cells, nanomedicine, and biotechnology",2019 03 19,"Osteoarthritis (OA) is a major cause of disability across the world, which its prevalence is relatively high in elder population.

Areas covered: This manuscript provides a comprehensive review of the results achieved by the FOLFOXIRI+biologic combination when used as first-line treatment in patients with mCRC. The search retrieved 19 clinical trial reports and 7 ongoing trials. The results are discussed focusing on secondary resection of metastatic disease, impact of sidedness (right-left primary tumor site), and impact of biomarkers. Expert opinion: Panitumumab is the only biologic that has proved its value when added to FOLFOXIRI in a randomized clinical trial. FOLFOXIRI-bevacizumab has the widest data from two large randomized phase III trials, being an option to be used in both the palliative and the conversion-therapy settings. However, the true benefit from adding bevacizumab remains to be established as it has not been evaluated in a randomized setting yet. Data on response rates and secondary resection rates are promising with the FOLFOXIRI-anti-EGFR combinations and may constitute a valuable option.

Body mass index (BMI), base heart rate (HR0), and age showed significant correlation with HBP in a simple and multiple linear regression analysis. HR0 was positively, and log deep sleep duration, negatively correlated with HBP in the adjusted multiple linear regression analysis. Physical and mental activities were negatively correlated with systolic blood pressure (SBP) in a simple linear regression, but high physical and mental activities tend to reduce deep sleep duration. Self-recorded sleep duration had no relationship with HBP. In conclusion, HR0, BMI, age, deep sleep duration, and activity showed relationships with HBP.

Expert commentary: Clinical trials of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) in AML and MDS are still in early stages and reported results so far have been modest especially for monotherapy use in the refractory settings. However, there are preliminary data for synergistic effects for combination of multiple ICI with hypomethylating agents and conventional chemotherapy. ICI might also be effective in eradicating minimal residual disease and to prevent relapse following induction chemotherapy or hematopoietic stem cell transplant.

Inconsistent definitions for and imprecise measurement of bullying in the literature impede a better understanding of this difference, and multiple types of bullying topographies create additional dimensions for analysis. In this study, participants rated the severity of bullying depicted in written vignettes of child-dyadic interactions. The vignettes varied across child age (4-15 years old) and described either one of four different types of bullying or non-bullying behavior. Participants included teachers and parents of children with autism spectrum disorder and community members without an autism spectrum disorder child. Participants' severity ratings of vignettes that described bullying differed by bullying type (i.e. verbal, physical, cyber, and interpersonal).

These interfaces enable and control the modular assembly of mold monomers into larger mold superstructure with programmable dimension in which each mold monomer remains uniquely addressable. Preloading the molds with nanoparticle seeds subsequently allows the growth of linear gold nanostructures whose lengths are controlled by the DNA structure. Exploiting the addressability of individual mold monomers furthermore allows achievement of site-specific metallization, that is, to create defined metal patterns.

For LiNi1- x- yCo xMn yO2 (NCM) cathodes, abrupt anisotropic collapse of the layered lattice structure at deep charge is generally considered characteristic to high Ni content and can be effectively suppressed by elemental substitution. Herein, we demonstrate the lattice collapse is a universal phenomenon almost entirely dependent on Li utilization, and not Ni content, of NCM cathodes upon delithiation. With Li removal nearing 80 mol %, very similar c-axis lattice shrinkage of around 5% occurs concurrently for NCMs synthesized in-house regardless of nickel content (90, 70, 50, or 33 mol %); meanwhile, the a-axis lattice contracts for high-Ni NCM, but it expands for low-Ni NCM. We further reveal Co-Mn cosubstitution in NCM barely, if at all, affects several key structural aspects governing the lattice distortion upon delithiation. Our results highlight the importance of evaluating true implications of compositional tuning on high-Ni layered oxide cathode materials to maximize their charge-storage capacities for next-generation high-energy Li-ion batteries."

In this article, we aim to explore the effect of caveolin-1 as a slow-release material on bone-tendon junction healing. Seventy-two New Zealand rabbits were randomly selected and assigned into the experimental, sham-operated and control groups (n = 24). Caveolin-1 microspheres and microcapsule were developed as drug delivery system. At the 4th, 8th, and 12th weeks after surgery, quadriceps muscle patella-patellar tendon (QMPPT) was obtained from each rabbit to observe the tendon-to-bone tunnel healing, and X-ray examination, histological examination and biomechanical testing were applied for evaluating new bone formation. As the X-ray showed, caveolin-1 increased the new bone area at each time point. At the 4th and 8th weeks after surgery, the rabbit treated with caveolin-1 slow release material showed repair of fibrocartilage. According to the biomechanical results, the cross-sectional area, breaking load and ultimate tensile strength were increased along with time. At the same time point, caveolin-1 increased the ultimate tensile strength. Our study demonstrates that caveolin-1 as a slow-release material could accelerate bone-tendon junction healing by promoting the formation of the transition zone.",Prognostic value of volumetric metabolic parameter changes determined by during and after radiotherapy-based 18 F-FDG PET/CT in stage III non-small cell lung cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30887722,The Kaohsiung journal of medical sciences,2019 03 19,"The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate the prognostic value of volumetric metabolic parameters assessed by during and after radiation-based therapy 18 F-FDG PET/CT in patients with stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We enrolled stage III NSCLC patients who had planned to receive definitive chemo-radiation or radiotherapy (RT) and underwent 18 F-FDG PET/CT before treatment (PET1), during RT (at the fifth week, PET2) and after treatment (3 months later, PET3). By comparing with PET1, percentage changes of metabolic tumor volume (ΔMTV) and tumor total lesion glycolysis (ΔTLG) of PET2 and PET3 were calculated. We used medians of ΔTLG and ΔMTV as cut-off values to stratify patients. Their prognostic values were evaluated by progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Thirty patients were enrolled initially. Five were excluded due to multiple metastases or double cancer. The remaining 25 patients had PET2 at a median of 46 Gy. Data on PET3 were available in 19 patients. During-RT ΔTLG (cut-off: 65%) was a significant prognostic factor for PFS (P = 0.02) and OS (P < 0.01). During-RT ΔMTV (cut-off: 42%) had marginal significance for PFS (P = 0.07) and was significant for OS (P = 0.02). Of the PET3 parameters, neither ΔTLG nor ΔMTV was a significant prognostic factor for PFS and OS. We conclude that ΔTLG of during-RT 18 F-FDG PET/CT may predict treatment response and thus provide opportunities to modify treatment for poor responders.",Low-dose midazolam and propofol use for conscious sedation during diagnostic endoscopy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30887720,The Kaohsiung journal of medical sciences,2019 03 19,"To find the right sedation technique for different types of treatment methods and the right amount of sedatives so the chances of side effects happening can be reduced. This was a retrospective cohort analysis conducted on prospectively collected data. Patients who underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy only (E group) were sub-divided into two subgroups: (a) Those who received 0.5 mg/kg of propofol (E-a), (b) Those who received 0.025 mg/kg of midazolam and 0.5 mg/kg of propofol (E-b). Patients who underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy with colonoscopy (EC group) were also sub-divided into three subgroups: (a) Those who received 0.5 mg/kg of propofol (EC-a), (b) Those who received 0.025 mg/kg of midazolam and 0.5 mg/kg of propofol (EC-b), (c) Those who received 25 mg (12.5 mg if body weight < 50 kg or age > 70) of meperidine and 0.025 mg/kg of midazolam along with 0.5 mg/kg of propofol (EC-c). When the level of target was not reached, 10-20 mg of propofol was additionally injected. Sedation efficacy and safety were then compared among groups. E-b and EC-b decreased the overall amount of propofol and reduced side effect of temporary hypoxemia compared to E-a and EC-a. EC-b shortened patient recovery time compared to EC-c and reduced paradoxical reaction. In terms of the patient satisfaction and patient cooperation by endoscopists, there were no significant differences between EC-b and EC-c. Concomitant use of low dosages of both propofol and midazolam is found to be useful and safe when endoscopy needs to be performed.",HBx inhibits HMGB1 expression and active oxygen production in LO2 cells through the NF-κB signaling pathway.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30887719,The Kaohsiung journal of medical sciences,2019 03 19,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is one of major causes of various kinds of liver diseases. Among the four open reading frames (ORFs) of the HBV genome, the X region of HBV encodes HBx protein, which plays an important regulatory role in HBV infection. NF-κB and high-mobility group protein box1 (HMGB1) are potentially able to enhance the scavenging activity of host cells against foreign microorganisms. The present study focuses on the effect of HBx on the expression of HMGB1 in vitro. First, the lentiviral vector was used to induce the overexpression of HBx protein in LO2 cells (a normal hepatocyte cell line). Then, NF-κB activity, HMGB1 expression and the production of ROS were detected by Western blot and DCFH-DA (ROS detector) staining. Afterward, rotenone and LPS, which are activors of ROS and NF-κB, respectively, were used to stimulate HBx-overexpressing cells. Then, the expression differentiation of HMGB1 and ROS or the activity alternation of NF-κB was detected again. HBx inhibited the activity of NF-κB, inhibited the expression of HMGB1 and inhibited the production of ROS. The stimulation study with retenone or LPS suggested that there were mutual regulations between NF-κB and HMGB1. HBx inhibits the expression of HMGB1 and the generation of ROS via the NF-κB signaling pathway.",Pretreatment of ankle nerve block provides better postoperative analgesia than peri-incisional local anesthetic infiltration in hallux valgus correction surgery.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30887717,The Kaohsiung journal of medical sciences,2019 03 19,"Adequate postoperative analgesia after hallux valgus (HV) correction surgery improves early mobilization and decreases hospital stay. Peripheral nerve block and peri-incisional local anesthetic (LA) infiltration are both widely used for pain management in orthopedic surgeries. The aim of this study was to compare the analgesic effects between the ankle block and peri-incisional infiltration technique in patients undergoing HV correction surgery. Ninety patients scheduled for hallux valgus correction surgery were randomly allocated into three groups. In group N, patients were pretreated with tibial and peroneal nerve blocks with 8-10 mL of 0.25% bupivacaine before surgery. In group P, patients received the same LA for peri-incisional infiltration preoperatively. In group C, patients underwent surgery without regional analgesic pretreatment. All patients had intravenous fentanyl patient control analgesia as part of multimodal postoperative pain management. Fentanyl consumption, rest and moving pain scale, and adverse effects were evaluated at postoperative 6 h (Poh6), Poh12, Poh 24, and Poh36, respectively. Patients receiving bilateral feet surgeries were excluded in this study. Seventy-five patients were enrolled into final analysis. The patients in group N expressed lower resting and moving pain scores at Poh6, but the pain scores turned similarly among the three groups following Poh12 and then. The total fentanyl consumption was significantly less in group N than in group P. The postoperative activities and mood disturbance were not significantly different between groups after Poh12 and then. We conclude that ankle block is better than peri-incisional LA infiltration in HV correction surgery in pain relief and fentanyl consumption.",MiR-101 relates to chronic peripheral neuropathic pain through targeting KPNB1 and regulating NF-κB signaling.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30887716,The Kaohsiung journal of medical sciences,2019 03 19,"Accumulating evidences indicates that chronic neuropathic pain is a kind of neuro-immune disorder with enhanced activation of the immune system. Although the prevalence is very high, neuropathic pain remains extremely difficult to cure. miRNAs are a group of short nonprotein coding RNAs, regulating target genes expression via targeting 3'-untranslated region. More and more research indicates that altered miRNAs expression profile relates to the pathogenesis of neuropathic pain. In this study, we firstly detected the expression of six candidate miRNAs in the plasma samples from 23 patients with neuropathic pain and 10 healthy controls. Subsequently, the level of miR-132 and miR-101 was detected in the sural nerve biopsies. We found miR-101 level was significantly repressed in both the plasma samples and sural nerve biopsies from neuropathic pain patients. Predicted by bioinformatics tools and confirmed by dual luciferase assay and immunoblotting, we identified that KPNB1 is a direct target of miR-101. The negative correlation between miR-101 and KPNB1 was also confirmed in the sural nerve biopsies, and miR-101 reduction relates to the activation of NF-κB signaling in vivo and in vitro which contributes to the pathogenesis of neuropathic pain.",Adhesive pyramidal thorn patches provide pain relief to athletes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30887714,The Kaohsiung journal of medical sciences,2019 04 12,"Pain in athletes is ideally treated without systemic medicine. Therefore, complementary and alternative medicine, including patch treatments, is often used. The physiologic mechanisms of pain relief produced by patch treatment, however, are not well elucidated. In the present study, we introduce a pyramidal thorn (PT) patch that we developed, demonstrate the effects of this PT patch for the treatment of various types of pain in 300 subjects, and suggest a physiologic mechanism for the pain relief effects. One treatment with the PT patch effectively relieved pain in almost half the subjects evaluated. Except for pain generated deeply under the skin, such as low-back pain, pain was eliminated within four treatments with the PT patch in almost all of the subjects. Interestingly, the pain-sensing region moved along the nerve fibers after each trial. Further, patches without PT also provided some pain relief. We considered that this effect was due to hair deflection on the skin; that is, adhesion of the PT patch activates Merkel cells directly as well as Merkel cell-neurite complexes around the hair follicles by deflecting the hair follicles, whereas adhesion of a patch without PT only activates the Merkel cell-neurite complexes. In any case, patch adhesion stimulates Aβ fibers to alleviate pain. Finally, we found that the pain threshold is increased by electric stimulation, suggesting that the gentle adhesion of a PT patch would be more effective. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate physiologically the validity of an adherent patch for pain relief.",The continuums of impairment in vascular reactivity across the spectrum of cardiometabolic health: A systematic review and network meta-analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30887713,Obesity reviews : an official journal of the International Association for the Study of Obesity,2019 05 17,"This study aimed to assess, for the first time, the change in vascular reactivity across the full spectrum of cardiometabolic health. Systematic searches were conducted in MEDLINE and EMBASE databases from their inception to March 13, 2017, including studies that assessed basal vascular reactivity in two or more of the following health groups (aged ≥18 years old): healthy, overweight, obesity, impaired glucose tolerance, metabolic syndrome, or type 2 diabetes with or without complications. Direct and indirect comparisons of vascular reactivity were combined using a network meta-analysis. Comparing data from 193 articles (7226 healthy subjects and 19344 patients), the network meta-analyses revealed a progressive impairment in vascular reactivity (flow-mediated dilation data) from the clinical onset of an overweight status (-0.41%, 95% CI, -0.98 to 0.15) through to the development of vascular complications in those with type 2 diabetes (-4.26%, 95% CI, -4.97 to -3.54). Meta-regressions revealed that for every 1 mmol/l increase in fasting blood glucose concentration, flow-mediated dilation decreased by 0.52%. Acknowledging that the time course of disease may vary between patients, this study demonstrates multiple continuums of vascular dysfunction where the severity of impairment in vascular reactivity progressively increases throughout the pathogenesis of obesity and/or insulin resistance, providing information that is important to enhancing the timing and effectiveness of strategies that aim to improve cardiovascular outcomes."

Improved strategies to preserve lungs after asystole may allow the recovery team to arrive after death actually occurs and enable the recovery of lungs from more cDCD donors. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of donor positioning on the quality of lung preservation after cardiac arrest in a cDCD model. Cardiac arrest was induced by withdrawal of ventilation under anesthesia in pigs. After asystole, animals were divided into 2 groups based on body positioning (supine or prone). All animals were subjected to 3 hours of warm ischemia. After the observation period, donor lungs were explanted and preserved at 4°C for 6 hours, followed by 6 hours of physiologic and biological lung assessment under normothermic ex vivo lung perfusion.

However, most studies are focused on the detection of DNMT1 activity, a few are concerned with the detection of DNMT1 content. In this study, we developed a simple and highly sensitive chemiluminescence (CL) assay for the detection of DNMT1 content. In this method, anti-DNMT1 monoclonal antibody was coated on a polystyrene microplate to capture DNMT1. Then anti-DNMT1 polyclonal antibody and goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G with horseradish peroxidase (IgG-HRP) were respectively added to combine with captured DNMT1 to form a sandwich structure. Finally, the HRP could catalyze CL substrate and achieve CL signal response. Based on this novel sensitive strategy, the recovery percents were in the ranges from 71.5% to 91.0%. The precision of intra-assays and inter-assays were 5.45%-11.29% and 7.03%-11.25%, respectively. The method was successfully applied for the determination of DNMT1 in human serum. The detection results of serum samples showed that the proposed assay had a high correlation with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit.

In early 2000, canine parvovirus type 2c (CPV-2c) was first reported and subsequently became a predominant subtype circulating in Europe and the Americas. CPV-2c has also been reported in Asia, including cases in China, India, Taiwan and Vietnam. However, CPV-2c has never been reported in Thailand. In this study, we conducted viral enteric disease surveillance in dogs and cats in Thailand during 2016-2018. During 20 months of surveillance, 507 rectal swab samples were collected from dogs (n = 444) and cats (n = 63) with and without clinical signs. The samples were examined for parvovirus by using VP2 gene-specific PCR for parvovirus. Our results showed that the positivity of canine parvovirus (CPV) was 29.95% and that of feline parvovirus (FPV) was 58.73%. In this study, we characterized 34 parvoviruses by VP2 gene sequencing. Moreover, two Thai-CPV-2 (Dog/CU-24 and Cat/CU-21) were characterized by whole genome sequencing. The phylogenetic results showed that Thai-CPV-2 had the highest nucleotide identities and clustered with Asian-CPV-2c but were in separate subclusters from the North American and European CPV-2c. Similarly, whole genome analyses showed that Thai-CPVs are closely related to Asian-CPV-2c, with unique amino acids at positions 297A, 324I, 370R and 426E. In summary, our results demonstrated the emergence of Asian-CPV-2c in dogs and cats in Thailand. Thus, the surveillance of CPV-2 in domestic dogs and cats should be further conducted on a larger scale to determine the dynamics of predominant variants and their distributions in the country and in the Southeast Asia region.",Surface analysis of sheep menisci after meniscectomy via infrared attenuated total reflection spectroscopy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30887689,Journal of biophotonics,2019 04 18,"Menisci are very important fibrocartilaginous tissue, which maintain biomechanical functions and physiological stabilization of knee joint. Meniscectomy is known as a surgery to recover partial functions from acute meniscus tears. However, the late consequences of total or partial meniscectomy include signs of osteoarthritis and even ligament instability. Infrared attenuated total reflection (IR-ATR) spectroscopy is a very useful technique, which can reveal molecular characteristics via the analysis of vibrational bands. The present study has employed IR-ATR spectroscopy to investigate sheep menisci samples after meniscectomy in a label-free fashion. Several differences of peak absorbance change and peak shift were observed between the native healthy samples and the meniscectomy samples in distinct IR wavenumber regions, such as amide I band, amide II band, C-H bending band as well as the sugar band region. Combining the results from the collagen protein IR spectra, it can be speculated that six months after meniscectomy collagen fibrils on the incision lose its ordered arrangement and a decrease in the triple helical structure of collagen fibril is observed. In addition, the collagen fibrils and proteoglycan content might also be slight varied after meniscectomy.","Ingestion of Steamed and Dehydrated Placenta Capsules Does Not Affect Postpartum Plasma Prolactin Levels or Neonatal Weight Gain: Results from a Randomized, Double-Bind, Placebo-Controlled Pilot Study.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30887687,Journal of midwifery & women's health,2019 03 19,"Clinical studies conducted in the early to mid-twentieth century, and recent self-reports by some maternal placentophagy practitioners, suggest that human maternal placentophagy improves breast milk quality and quantity, although little research has evaluated this claim. Some placentophagy providers and advocates suggest that increased prolactin levels after placenta ingestion could account for the purported lactation benefits. The current study was conducted to evaluate these claims by comparing plasma prolactin levels of women consuming steamed, dehydrated, and encapsulated placenta with those of women consuming a placebo. Neonatal weight gain was also compared between the 2 groups.",Laboratory contamination over time during low-biomass sample analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30887686,Molecular ecology resources,2019 04 29,"Bacteria are not only ubiquitous on earth but can also be incredibly diverse within clean laboratories and reagents. The presence of both living and dead bacteria in laboratory environments and reagents is especially problematic when examining samples with low endogenous content (e.g., skin swabs, tissue biopsies, ice, water, degraded forensic samples or ancient material), where contaminants can outnumber endogenous microorganisms within samples. The contribution of contaminants within high-throughput studies remains poorly understood because of the relatively low number of contaminant surveys. Here, we examined 144 negative control samples (extraction blank and no-template amplification controls) collected in both typical molecular laboratories and an ultraclean ancient DNA laboratory over 5 years to characterize long-term contaminant diversity. We additionally compared the contaminant content within a home-made silica-based extraction method, commonly used to analyse low endogenous content samples, with a widely used commercial DNA extraction kit. The contaminant taxonomic profile of the ultraclean ancient DNA laboratory was unique compared to modern molecular biology laboratories, and changed over time according to researcher, month and season. The commercial kit also contained higher microbial diversity and several human-associated taxa in comparison to the home-made silica extraction protocol. We recommend a minimum of two strategies to reduce the impacts of laboratory contaminants within low-biomass metagenomic studies: (a) extraction blank controls should be included and sequenced with every batch of extractions and (b) the contributions of laboratory contamination should be assessed and reported in each high-throughput metagenomic study.",Initial single institution experience with robotic biliary surgery and bilio-enteric anastomosis in southeast Asia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30887681,ANZ journal of surgery,2019 04 03,"Presently, experience with robotic biliary surgery (RBS) is increasing worldwide although widespread adoption remains limited.

If so, one may expect that the phenotype of clonal organisms may reflect such genetic and/or environmental stress. To test this hypothesis, we compared the developmental stability of bisexual and parthenogenetic lizards of the genus Darevskia. We assessed asymmetries in three meristic traits: ventral, preanal, and supratemporal scales. Our results suggest that the amount of ventral and preanal asymmetries is significantly higher in clones compared with their maternal, but not paternal, progenitor species. However, it is questionable, whether this is a consequence of clonality, as it may be considered a mild form of outbreeding depression as well. Moreover, most ventral asymmetries were found in the bisexual species Darevskia valentini. We suggest that greater differences in asymmetry levels among bisexuals may be, for instance, a consequence of the population size: the smaller the population, the higher the inbreeding and the developmental instability. On the basis of the traits examined in this study, the parthenogens do not seem to be of significantly poorer quality.",Assessing the acute effects of prenatal synthetic cannabinoid exposure on murine fetal brain vasculature using optical coherence tomography.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30887665,Journal of biophotonics,2019 04 22,"Marijuana is one of the most commonly abused substances during pregnancy. Synthetic cannabinoids (SCBs) are a group of heterogeneous compounds that are 40- to 600-fold more potent than Δ9 -tetrahydrocannabinol, the major psychoactive component of marijuana. With SCBs being legally available for purchase and the prevalence of unplanned pregnancies, the possibility of prenatal exposure to SCBs is high. However, the effects of prenatal SCB exposure on embryonic brain development are not well understood. In this study, we use complex correlation mapping optical coherence angiography to evaluate changes in murine fetal brain vasculature in utero, minutes after maternal exposure to an SCB, CP-55940. Results showed a significant decrease (P < 0.05) in fetal brain vessel diameter, length fraction and area density when compared to the sham group. This preliminary study shows that acute prenatal exposure to an SCB resulted in significant fetal brain vasoconstriction during the peak period for brain development.",Lianas as a food resource for herbivorous insects: a comparison with trees.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30887664,Biological reviews of the Cambridge Philosophical Society,2019 03 19,"Woody climbers or, 'lianas', are one of the features that characterise rainforests. They contribute substantially to plant diversity and leaf biomass which makes them a potentially important food source for herbivores. Here, we focus on insect herbivores, folivores in particular, to show how disparities in the quantitative and qualitative availability of leaves between lianas and trees may differentially influence insect folivory and the herbivore communities themselves. We develop a conceptual model and show that lianas in general have lower structural and chemical defences, a greater nutritional profile and a preferable phenology in comparison with trees, which, contrary to our expectations, has led to assemblages of more-specialised insects. The impacts this has on higher trophic levels and broader ecological networks, however, are poorly known. We show through a study of four tropical floras from different biogeographic realms that lianas are likely to be a target for a wide range of insect herbivore taxa as they are a phylogenetically diverse group and increase diversity of higher taxa at local scales. This, in combination with their highly palatable leaves, may also make them a suitable temporary food source for insects during times when preferred host plants are scarce. This phenomenon has been observed in mammalian herbivores but awaits investigation in insects as does the effects this may have on survival and fitness. Apparent recent increases in liana abundances in some forests, likely due to climate change, makes understanding their role in supporting and maintaining biodiversity an increasingly important and necessary challenge. Since trees or saplings have usually been the subject of studies on insect herbivory, major knowledge gaps remain about the ways in which lianas contribute to, support and maintain the ecosystems in which they exist. We use our conceptual model to guide future research directions and express the necessity for caution when extrapolating explanations of herbivory derived from data on trees to growth forms with fundamentally different ecologies.",Digital Workflow of Auricular Rehabilitation: A Technical Report Using an Intraoral Scanner.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30887663,Journal of prosthodontics : official journal of the American College of Prosthodontists,2019 06 14,"Prosthodontic rehabilitation of a congenital or acquired defect of the ear is considered a challenging and skill-dependent procedure.

This study investigated how VN deficiency contributes to the development of NASH. Towards this aim, wild-type (WT) and VN-/- mice were fed with a choline-deficient, L-amino acid-defined, high-fat diet (CDAHFD) for 6 and 10 weeks to induce NASH, and the livers were isolated. In WT mice fed with CDAHFD for 6 and 10 weeks, the expression of Vn mRNA and protein was up-regulated compared with that in mice fed with the MF control diet, indicating that VN is regulated in NASH condition. VN-/- mice showed decreased picrosirius red staining in the liver area and Col1a2 mRNA expression levels, compared with WT mice, indicating that the severity of hepatic fibrosis is attenuated in the CDAHFD-fed VN-/- mice. In addition, VN deficiency did not affect the area of lipid droplets in haematoxylin-eosin staining and the mRNA expression levels of fatty acid synthases, Srebp, Acc and Fas in the CDAHFD-fed mice. Moreover, VN deficiency decreased the inflammation score and the mRNA expression levels of Cd11b and F4/80, macrophage markers, as well as Tnf-α and Il-1β, inflammatory cytokines in the CDAHFD-fed mice. Furthermore, VN deficiency decreased the protein and mRNA expression levels of α-smooth muscle actin in the CDAHFD-fed mice, suggesting that VN deficiency inhibits the activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). Our findings indicate that VN contributes to the development of fibrosis in the NASH model mice via modulation of the inflammatory reaction and activation of HSCs.",Why are people with asthma susceptible to pneumonia? A review of factors related to upper airway bacteria.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30887658,"Respirology (Carlton, Vic.)",2019 04 17,"Asthma and pneumonia are common respiratory conditions globally, affecting individuals of all ages. Streptococcus pneumoniae is the predominant bacterial cause of pneumonia, with nasopharyngeal carriage an important step towards invasive and pulmonary disease. Vaccines provide individual protection, and also prevent nasopharyngeal carriage, providing herd immunity. Asthma is associated with an increased risk of pneumonia, but there is limited information on the underlying mechanism of this predisposition. Both asthma and its treatment may conceivably alter propensity to, and density of, carriage through an altered epithelial microenvironment driven by disease-related inflammation or treatment-related immunomodulation, for example with inhaled corticosteroids. The relative importance of these factors could impact the efficacy of vaccines in this vulnerable patient population. In this review, we summarize the evidence for an increased risk of pneumonia in asthma, and discuss factors affecting nasopharyngeal carriage in the context of current guidelines for pneumococcal vaccination.","Moral entrepreneurship, the power-knowledge nexus, and the Cochrane ""crisis"".",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30887656,Journal of evaluation in clinical practice,2019 03 19,"In 2018, a so-called crisis developed in the international network of systematic reviewers known as Cochrane.

Postpartum depression and anxiety disorders are highly prevalent in new mothers and negatively affect offspring's cognitive development through mechanisms which are still unclear. Here, using a rat model, we manipulated the maternal social environment during lactation and explored the pathways through which social isolation (vs. the opportunity for limited social interaction with another lactating female, from 1 day before parturition to postpartum day 16) and chronic social conflict (daily exposure to a male intruder from postpartum day 2 to day 16) affect offspring learning and memory, measured at 40 to 60 days of age. We specifically explored the consequences of these social treatments on two main hypothesized mediators likely to affect offspring neurophysiological development: the quality of maternal care and maternal inflammation factors (brain-derived neurotrophic factor, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, intercellular adhesion molecule 1, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 1 and vascular endothelial growth factor) likely to influence offspring development through lactation. Maternal rats which had the opportunity to interact with another lactating female spent more time with their pups which, in turn, displayed improved working and reference memory. Social stress affected maternal plasma levels of cytokines that were associated with cognitive deficits in their offspring. However, females subjected to social stress were protected from these stress-induced immune changes and associated offspring cognitive impairment by increased social affiliation. These results underscore the effects of social interaction for new mothers and their offspring and can be used to inform the development of clinical preventative measures and interventions.",Direct Non-Oxidative Methane Conversion in a Millisecond Catalytic Wall Reactor.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30887653,Angewandte Chemie (International ed. in English),2019 05 13,"Direct non-oxidative methane conversion (DNMC) has been recognized as a single-step technology that directly converts methane into olefins and higher hydrocarbons. High reaction temperature and low catalyst durability, resulting from the endothermic reaction and coke deposition, are two main challenges. We show that a millisecond catalytic wall reactor enables stable methane conversion, C2+ selectivity, coke yield, and long-term durability. These effects originate from initiation of the DNMC on a reactor wall and maintenance of the reaction by gas-phase chemistry within the reactor compartment. The results obtained under various temperatures and gas flow rates form a basis for optimizing the process towards lighter C2 or heavier aromatic products. A process simulation was done by Aspen Plus to understand the practical implications of this reactor in DNMC. High carbon and thermal efficiencies and low cost of the reactor materials are realized, indicating the technoeconomic viability of this DNMC technology."

Part A : the journal of the International Society for Analytical Cytology,2019 04 16,"On May 2017, the World Health Organization (WHO) recognized sepsis as a global health priority by adopting a resolution to improve the prevention, diagnosis, and management of this deadly disease. While it has long been known that sepsis deeply perturbs immune homeostasis by inducing a tremendous systemic inflammatory response, pivotal observations based on clinical flow cytometry indicate that sepsis indeed initiates a more complex immune response that varies over time, with the concomitant occurrence of both pro- and anti-inflammatory mechanisms. As a resultant, some septic patients enter a stage of protracted immunosuppression. This paved the way for immunostimulation approaches in sepsis. Clinical flow cytometry permitted this evolution by drawing a new picture of pathophysiology and reshaping immune trajectories in patients. Additional information from cytometry by time of flight mass cytometry and other high-dimensional flow cytometry platform should rapidly enrich our understanding of this complex disease.

Since the implementation of nanotechnology on Si anode, the significant progress has been made as addressing severe volume change during (de)lithiation. However, the practical application of Si anodes in commercial lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) has been still stagnant. Nowadays, with the drastic increase in energy demands of diverse industries, co-utilization of Si and graphite has resurfaced as the commercially viable method for realizing high energy. Herein, we highlight the necessity for the co-utilization of graphite and Si in terms of the commercialization, and carefully review the development of graphite/Si anodes. Representative Si anodes implemented in the graphite-blended electrode are covered and a variety of strategies for building graphite/Si composites are organized according to their synthetic methods. Particularly noteworthy, the critical factors for the co-utilization of graphite and Si are systematically presented. Finally, we provide insightful suggestions with regard to the co-utilization of graphite and Si for the commercialization.",Beyond death and graft survival-Variation in outcomes after liver transplant.

In this analysis, surgical site infection (SSI), urinary tract infection (UTI), and unplanned reoperation/intervention after liver transplantation were evaluated. We observed impressive variation in the crude incidence between sites for SSI (0%-29%), UTI (0%-10%), and reoperation/intervention (0%-57%). After adjustment for donor and recipient factors, at least 1 site was identified as an outlier for each of the analyzed outcomes.

Increased efforts to influence older people's falls prevention behaviour are needed. A two-phase exploratory community-based participatory study was conducted in Western Australia. First, three prototype audio-visual (AV) falls prevention messages were designed collaboratively with six older people. Second, the messages' effect on community-dwelling older people's knowledge, awareness and motivation to take action regarding falls prevention was explored using focus groups. Data were analysed using thematic analysis to explore participants' responses to the messages. The participants' (n = 54) perspectives on the AV messages varied widely and stereotypes of ageing appeared to influence these. The presented falls facts (including falls epidemiology statistics) increased some participants' falls risk awareness and falls prevention knowledge. Other participants felt ready-to-use falls prevention information was lacking. Some expressed positive emotions or a personal connection to the messages and suggested the messages helped reduce ageing-related stigma. Strongly opposing viewpoints suggested that other participants identified implicit negative messages about ageing, which reduced their motivation with the messages. Suggestions to improve the message persuasiveness included adding more drama and tailoring messages to appeal to multiple age groups. Overall, the AV falls prevention messages designed in collaboration with older people elicited a divergent range of positive and negative perspectives from their peers, which was conceptualised by the overarching theme 'we all look at things different ways'. Opinions differed regarding whether the messages would appeal to older people. Public campaigns targeting falls prevention should be designed and tailored towards older peoples' differing perspectives about ageing.",Sonographic markers of increased fetal adiposity demonstrate an increased risk for Cesarean delivery.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30887629,Ultrasound in obstetrics & gynecology : the official journal of the International Society of Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynecology,2019 03 19,Increased fetal size is associated with labor dystocia and subsequent need for assisted delivery.

This retrospective case series describes observations in eight dogs with syringobulbia diagnosed during MRI. All dogs were adult, small-breed dogs with concurrent syringomyelia and neurologic deficits localized to sites rostral to the spinal cord, which cannot be explained by syringomyelia (eg, six dogs had vestibular signs). On MRI, the fluid-filled cavities had signal intensity characteristics like cerebrospinal fluid, were in the medulla oblongata, and were solitary in each dog. Initially, the shape of the cavity was a slit in five dogs and bulbous in two dogs. Magnetic resonance imaging was repeated in five dogs (6-55 months of age). One dog had progression of syringobulbia from slit-like to bulbous, and four dogs had unchanged slit-like syringobulbia. One dog developed slit-like syringobulbia after cranioplasty. A variety of medical and surgical treatments were performed with improvement of some but not all clinical signs. One dog died following surgery due to cardiopulmonary failure and the other seven dogs were alive at least 1 year after the initial diagnosis, which was the least time of follow-up. One surviving dog developed a unilateral hypoglossal nerve deficit 2 months after the initial diagnosis and megaesophagus 14 months later. In conclusion, detecting a fluid-filled cavity in the medulla oblongata consistent with syringobulbia is possible in dogs undergoing MRI. The cavity is likely acquired, slit-like or bulbous, progressive, or static, and might be associated with breed size and neurologic signs localized to the medulla oblongata.",Staff experiences and understandings of the REsTRAIN Yourself initiative to minimize the use of physical restraint on mental health wards.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30887624,International journal of mental health nursing,2019 03 19,"International efforts to minimize coercive practices include the US Six Core Strategies© (6CS). This innovative approach has limited evidence of its effectiveness, with few robustly designed studies, and has not been formally implemented or evaluated in the UK. An adapted version of the 6CS, which we called 'REsTRAIN Yourself' (RY), was devised to suit the UK context and evaluated using mixed methods. RY aimed to reduce the use of physical restraint in mental health inpatient ward settings through training and practice development with whole teams, directly in the ward settings where change was to be implemented and barriers to change overcome. In this paper, we present qualitative findings that report on staff perspectives of the impact and value of RY following its implementation. Thirty-six staff participated in semi-structured interviews with data subject to thematic analysis. Eight themes are reported that highlight perceived improvements in every domain of the 6CS after RY had been introduced. Staff reported more positively on their relationships with service users and felt their attitudes towards the use of coercive practices such as restraint were changed; the service as a whole shifted in terms of restraint awareness and reduction; and new policies, procedures, and language were introduced despite certain barriers. These findings need to be appreciated in a context wherein substantial reductions in the use of physical restraint were proven possible, largely due to building upon empathic and relational alternatives. However, yet more could be achieved with greater resourcing of inpatient care."

Here, in this study, we have investigated the synergistic effects of AF and morin and their mechanism for the anticancer effects focusing on apoptosis in Hep3B human hepatocellular carcinoma cells. We assessed the anticancer activities by annexin V/PI double staining, caspase, and TrxR activity assay. Morin enhances the inhibitory effects on TrxR activity of AF as well as reducing cell viability. Annexin V/PI double staining revealed that morin/AF cotreatment induced apoptotic cell death. Morin enhances AF-induced mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) loss and cytochrome c release. Further, morin/AF cotreatment upregulated death receptor DR4/DR5, modulated Bcl-2 family members (upregulation of Bax and downregulation of Bcl-2), and activated caspase-3, -8, and -9. Morin also enhances AF-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. The anticancer effects results from caspase-dependent apoptosis, which was triggered via extrinsic pathway by upregulating TRAIL receptors (DR4/DR5) and enhanced via intrinsic pathway by modulating Bcl-2 and inhibitor of apoptosis protein family members.

This study aimed to investigate the mutation of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in urine supernatant to develop a reliable diagnostic biomarker for UTUC patients. We studied urinary cfDNA from 153 individuals, including 56 patients with localized UTUC, and carried out droplet digital PCR assay for TERT promoter and FGFR3 hotspot mutations.

The results showed that proxies of environmental unpredictability, including parental separation, were positively associated with aggression and risk-taking and negatively associated with slow LH strategy, which in turn was negatively associated with aggression and risk-taking. Children separated from their parents scored lower on slow LH strategies and higher on aggression and risk-taking. These findings support the evolutionary assumption that human development responds to safety cues through behavioral implementations of LH strategies."

Correctly performed, the treatment outcomes will include resolution of the inflammation concomitant with shrinkage of the tissues, reflected in reduced probing depths. Depending on the patient data obtained after initial antiinfective therapy, further - mostly surgical - treatment may be rendered to reach the goals of a healthy periodontium and peri-implant tissues. Patient compliance is as important as operator skills for optimal treatment outcomes. Regenerative therapy may be applied in compliant patients and for appropriate defects. This article depicts the historical development of periodontal therapy during the 20th century and addresses the various outcome parameters to be used in daily decision making. Obviously, nonsurgical therapy has gained clinical relevance, resulting in highly satisfactory treatment outcomes in many cases. The critical probing depth above which positive attachment gain is registered varies from one treatment modality to another. It is a concept that helps facilitate decision making for additional therapeutic measures after initial therapy. Treatment of peri-implant mucositis prevents development of peri-implantitis. Hence, nonsurgical treatment of mucositis is frequently performed during the continuous monitoring of oral implants.

Despite both theoretical and practical importance, the role of water molecules in the reactivity and endo/exo selectivity remains unclear. To explore how water accelerates the reactions and improves the endo/exo selectivity of the cycloadditions of 1,3-dipole phthalazinium-2-dicyanomethanide (1) and two dipolarophiles, an ab initio-quality neural network potential that overcomes the computational bottleneck of explicitly considering water molecules was used. It is demonstrated that not only the nature of both the dipolarophile and the 1,3-dipole, but also the solvent medium, can perturb or even alter the reaction mechanism. An extreme case was found for the reaction of 1,3-dipole 1 with methyl vinyl ketone, in which the reaction mechanism changes from a concerted to a stepwise mode on going from MeCN to H2 O as solvent, with formation of a zwitterionic intermediate that is a very shallow minimum on the energy surface. Thus, high stereocontrol can still be expected despite the stepwise nature of the mechanism. The results indicate that water can induce global polarization along the reaction coordinate and highlight the role of microsolvation effects and bulk-phase effects in reproducing the experimentally observed aqueous acceleration and enhanced endo/exo selectivity.",Oestradiol acts through its beta receptor to increase vasopressin neuronal activation and secretion induced by dehydration.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30887585,Journal of neuroendocrinology,2019 04 24,"Vasopressinergic neurones of the supraoptic (SON) and paraventricular (PVN) nuclei express oestrogen receptor (ER)β and receive afferent projections from osmosensitive neurones that express ERα. However, which subtype of these receptors mediates the effects of oestradiol on vasopressin (AVP) secretion induced by hydromineral challenge has not yet been demonstrated in vivo. Moreover, AVP secretion induced by hyperosmolality is known to involve activation of TRPV1 (transient receptor potential vanilloid, member 1) in magnocellular neurones, although whether oestradiol modulates expression of this receptor is unknown. Thus, the present study aimed to clarify the mechanisms involved in the modulation exerted by oestradiol on AVP secretion, specifically investigating the involvement of ERβ, ERα and TRPV1 receptors in response to water deprivation (WD). We observed that treatment with an ERβ agonist potentiated AVP secretion and vasopressinergic neuronal activation induced by WD. This increase in AVP secretion induced by WD was reversed by an ERβ antagonist. By contrast to ERβ, the ERα agonist did not alter plasma AVP concentrations or activation of AVP neurones in the SON and PVN. Additionally, Fos expression in the subfornical organ was not altered by the ERα agonist. TRPV1 mRNA expression was increased by WD in the SON, although this response was not altered by any treatment. The results of the present study suggest that ERβ mediates the effects of oestradiol on AVP secretion in response to WD, indicating that the effects of oestradiol occur directly in AVP neurones without affecting TRPV1.",Microtargeting for conservation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30887584,Conservation biology : the journal of the Society for Conservation Biology,2019 04 16,"Widespread human action and behavior change is needed to achieve many conservation goals. Doing so at the requisite scale and pace will require the efficient delivery of outreach campaigns. Conservation gains will be greatest when efforts are directed toward places of high conservation value (or need) and tailored to critical actors. Recent strategic conservation planning has relied primarily on spatial assessments of biophysical attributes, largely ignoring the human dimensions. Elsewhere, marketers, political campaigns, and others use microtargeting-predictive analytics of big data-to identify people most likely to respond positively to particular messages or interventions. Conservationists have not yet widely capitalized on these techniques. To investigate the effectiveness of microtargeting to improve conservation, we developed a propensity model to predict restoration behavior among 203,645 private landowners in a 5,200,000 ha study area in the Chesapeake Bay Watershed (U.S.A.). To isolate the additional value microtargeting may offer beyond geospatial prioritization, we analyzed a new high-resolution land-cover data set and cadastral data to identify private owners of riparian areas needing restoration. Subsequently, we developed and evaluated a restoration propensity model based on a database of landowners who had conducted restoration in the past and those who had not (n = 4978). Model validation in a parallel database (n = 4989) showed owners with the highest scorers for propensity to conduct restoration (i.e., top decile) were over twice as likely as average landowners to have conducted restoration (135%). These results demonstrate that microtargeting techniques can dramatically increase the efficiency and efficacy of conservation programs, above and beyond the advances offered by biophysical prioritizations alone, as well as facilitate more robust research of many social-ecological systems.",Addressing the room for improvement in management of acute promyelocytic leukemia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30887583,European journal of haematology,2019 05 17,"Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is highly curable.

Among them, only three cases were genetically analyzed. We describe the genetic features of a rapidly growing adipose tumor that occurred in the thigh of a 7-year-old girl. Histologically, it was composed of mature adipocytic cells with a few atypia. Molecular analysis showed high-level amplification of the 12q13-21 region including MDM2 among 64 amplified genes. MDM2 amplification is a diagnostic hallmark of ALT/WDLPS/DDLPS. In adult cases, it is typically located in ring or giant marker chromosomes. In the present case, extra-copies of MDM2 were located on double minute chromosomes (dmin). This raised the hypothesis of dmin being precursors of adult's rings and giant markers and may provide indications for a better understanding of the mechanisms of adipose tumor oncogenesis."

The sorting nexin Snx10 is a (Phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate) PI3P-binding protein, which localizes to osteoclast early endosomes. Osteoclasts from humans and mice lacking functional Snx10 are severely dysfunctional. They show marked impairments in endocytosis, extracellular acidification, ruffled border formation, and bone resorption, suggesting that Snx10 regulates membrane trafficking. To better understand how SNx10 regulates vesicular formation and trafficking in osteoclasts, we set out on a search for Snx10 partners. We performed a yeast two-hybrid screening and identified FKBP12. FKBP12 is expressed in receptor activator of nuclear factor kB ligand-stimulated RAW264.7 monocytes, coimmunoprecipitates with Snx10, and colocalizes with Snx10 in osteoclasts. We also found that FKBP12, Snx10, and early endosome antigen 1 (EEA1) are present in the same subcellular fractions obtained by centrifugation in sucrose gradients, which confirms localization of FKBP12 to early endosomes. Taken together, these results indicate that Snx10 and FKBP12 are partners and suggest that Snx10 and FKBP12 are involved in the regulation of endosome/lysosome homeostasis via the synthesis. These findings may suggest novel therapeutic approaches to control bone loss by targeting essential steps in osteoclast membrane trafficking.",Stimulatory effects of platycodin D on osteoblast differentiation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30887567,Journal of cellular biochemistry,2019 06 14,"Previous studies have suggested that platycodin D is implicated in bone biology and ameliorates osteoporosis development. Platycodin D repressed the osteoclast activity and enhanced bone mineral density in the mouse model. However, the effects of platycodin D on osteoblast differentiation have not been elucidated yet. In C3H10T1/2 cells, platycodin D upregulated osteogenic markers including alkaline phosphatase (ALP), bone sialoprotein, and collagen type 1 alpha 1, and transcription factors, such as Runx2 and osterix, subsequently enhancing the bone mineralization. In a molecular mechanism study, platycodin D induced β-catenin nuclear accumulation by upregulating GSK3β phosphorylation. Furthermore, platycodin D upregulated the ALP activity and enhanced the mineralization process in osteoblast cells via the sirtuin 1/β-catenin pathways. Taken together, these results suggested that platycodin D could be an effective therapeutic compound against osteoporosis because of its regulatory effects during the osteoblast differentiation.",Association of Fc gamma-receptor genes polymorphisms with chronic periodontitis and Peri-Implantitis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30887566,Journal of cellular biochemistry,2019 04 04,"This study was conducted on 87 patients with chronic periodontitis (CP), 50 patients with peri-implantitis and 90 periodontally healthy individuals referring to the Department of Periodontics for evaluating the association between Fc gamma-receptor genes polymorphisms with CP and peri-implantitis. After obtaining consent, venous blood samples (5cc) were obtained from patients and DNA was extracted using Miller's salting-out method. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-restriction fragment length polymorphism and tetra-primer amplification refractory mutation system-PCR methods were used to assess the polymorphisms of FcγRs IIa, IIIa, and IIIb genes.

Bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2) is an important osteogenic factor involved in the transcription of key osteogenic genes such as alkaline phosphatase (ALP). While, antagonists such as noggin effectively restrict osteoblast differentiation through binding to BMP-2. In this study, we sought to understand the effect of exogenous noggin in osteoblasts and its role in BMP-2 activation of osteogenesis. Enzymatic activity of ALP was monitored to ascertain the effect of the noggin. Fluorescently labelled noggin was used to determine the binding of noggin to the BMP-2 receptor. The results demonstrated that noggin significantly increases the activity of ALP at concentrations of 50 to 400 ng/mL. While, it inhibited the activity of exogenous BMP-2. Furthermore, fluorescently labelled noggin showed strong binding to osteoblasts which were perturbed when cells were preincubated with BMP-2 suggesting that noggin shares a common receptor with BMP-2. These results suggest that exogenous noggin facilitates osteogenic differentiation and provide a novel mechanism for its interplay with BMP-2.","New molecular biomarkers in differentiated thyroid carcinoma: Impact of miR-146, miR-221 and miR-222 levels in the evolution of the disease.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30887564,Clinical endocrinology,2019 06 13,"MircroRNAs (miR) are small, noncoding RNA molecules of 18-25 nucleotides.

The objective of the present study is to investigate whether ICA prevents bone loss by acting on BMSCs via affecting the level of autophagy after ovariectomy (OVX). The BMSCs were extracted from BALB/c mice treated with ICA, chloroquine (CQ, an autophagy inhibitor) or ICA + CQ. The OVX mice were injected with ICA, CQ, or ICA + CQ for 1 month. We performed Alizarin Red staining and alkaline phosphatase staining to detect osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs. Micro-CT, hematoxylin and eosin staining, Oil Red O staining, and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase staining were used to assess the bone mass, lipid droplets and osteoclasts in femurs. Autophagy activity in BMSCs from different groups was evaluated by Western blot analysis. The osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs from OVX-induced OP mice was decreased. Treatment with ICA reduced bone loss and formation of osteoclasts and increased osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs in vitro and vivo. In addition, autophagy was enhanced in BMSCs of OVX mice treated with ICA. Our results indicate that ICA prevents OVX-induced bone loss possibly by strengthening the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs via increasing autophagic activity.",Immunohistochemical characterization of benign activation of junctional melanocytes and melanoma in situ of the nail unit.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30887559,Journal of cutaneous pathology,2019 05 03,"Immunohistochemical (IHC) stains that distinguish benign, pigmented nail lesions from malignancy are needed.

We found that higher accumulated power of sleep slow waves was associated with slower motor progression, particularly of axial motor symptoms, over a mean time of 4.6 ± 2.3 years. This preliminary finding suggests that deeper sleep relates to slower motor progression in Parkinson disease.

Extensive studies have focused on the contribution of obesity (excessive mechanical stress), comorbidity frequently found in T2DM, to cartilage destruction during OA development. However, a little is known about how diabetes-related inflammation may affect the local cartilage in a diabetic objective. In the present study, we were able to establish a T2DM rat model using a combination of a low dose of streptozotocin with high-fat and high-sugar diet. Although the cartilage integrity was comparable between the control and T2DM groups, the expression of matrix metalloproteinases-13 (MMP-13) was significantly upregulated in T2DM, indicating the initiation of an early cascade of cartilage degeneration. In parallel, an obvious alteration of subchondral bone remodeling (inhibition of bone formation) was observed, as evidenced by the reduction of osterix-expressing positive cells. Moreover, we demonstrated that the expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) in the serum and synovium of T2DM rats was elevated, accompanied by an increase of synovitis score. We also noticed that the number of F4/80-positive macrophage cells was significantly increased in the T2DM group. Mechanistically, the expression of ICAM-1 in fibroblast-like synoviocytes can be triggered by glucose and interleukin-1β, which are the two important factors within the joint of T2DM. Given that MMP-13 expression was significantly upregulated in the T2DM cartilage, and that ICAM-1-mediated filtration of macrophage was associated with synovitis, we propose that ICAM-1 is essential for triggering a vicious cycle of inflammation within the joint, which together subsequently drivers the cartilage degradation.",Systematic review with meta-analysis: the growing incidence and prevalence of eosinophilic oesophagitis in children and adults in population-based studies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30887555,Alimentary pharmacology & therapeutics,2019 04 12,"The frequency of eosinophilic oesophagitis (EoE) occurrence is escalating.

A number of causal sequences have been proposed. First, that aggression leads to heavy alcohol use. Second, that heavy alcohol use leads to aggression. Third, that the association between alcohol use and aggression is due to confounding by (a) sociodemographic variables or (b) delinquency. We report here data from four Australasian prospective longitudinal studies of adolescents, to assess the temporal sequence of heavy drinking and aggression over the period from adolescence to young adulthood. The four cohort studies provide a total sample of 6,706 persons (Australian Temperament Project, n = 1701; Christchurch Health and Development Study, n = 931; Mater-University of Queensland Study of Pregnancy, n = 2437; Victorian Adolescent Health Cohort Study, n = 1637). We use multinomial logistic regression to determine whether early adolescent aggression predicts subsequent age of onset of heavy episodic drinking (HED), after adjustment for concurrent sociodemographic factors and delinquency. We then consider whether HED predicts subsequent aggression, after adjusting for past aggression, concurrent delinquency, and a range of confounders. There are broadly consistent findings across the four cohort studies. Early aggression strongly predicts subsequent HED. HED predicts later aggression after adjustment for prior aggression and other confounders. Policies that alter population levels of alcohol consumption are likely to impact on levels of aggression in societies where HED linked to aggression is more common.",Research versus practice: The dilemmas of research ethics in the era of learning health-care systems.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30887541,Bioethics,2019 05 28,"In this article we attempt to answer the question of how the ethical and conceptual framework (ECF) for a learning health-care system (LHS) affects some of the main controversies in research ethics by addressing five key problems of research ethics: (a) What is the difference between practice and research? (b) What is the relationship between research ethics and clinical ethics? (c) What is the ethical relevance of the principle of clinical equipoise? (d) Does participation in research require a higher standard of informed consent than the practice of medicine? and (e) What ethical principle should take precedence in medicine? These questions allow us to construct two opposite idealized positions on the distinction between research and practice: the integration model and the segregation model of research and practice. We then compare the ECF for an LHS with these two idealized positions. We argue that the ECF for a LHS does not, in fact, solve these problems, but that it is a third, separate position in the relationship between research ethics and clinical ethics. Moreover, we suggest that the ECF for a LHS raises new ethical problems that require additional ethical analysis and justification. Our article contributes to the discussion on the relationship between research ethics and clinical ethics, revealing that although a learning health-care system may significantly change the landscape of health care, some ethical dilemmas still require resolving on both theoretical and policy-making levels.","Natural infection by Culex flavivirus in Culex quinquefasciatus mosquitoes captured in Cuiabá, Mato Grosso Mid-Western Brazil.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30887540,Medical and veterinary entomology,2019 03 19,"New species of insect-specific viruses (ISV) have been reported worldwide. In the present study, the complete genome of Culex flavivirus (CxFV) and partial sequences of other ISVs in Culex quinquefasciatus Say 1823 females (n = 3425) sampled in 200 urban areas census tracts of Cuiaba, state of Mato Grosso, were identified via reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction for a NS5 region of flaviviruses, nucleotide and high-throughput sequencing, and viral isolation in C6/36 cells. CxFV was detected in 16 of 403 mosquito pools; sequences found in the study presented a high similarity with isolates from São Paulo, Brazil and other countries in Latin American that belong to genotype II, supporting the geographical influence on CxFV evolution. The monthly maximum likelihood estimation for CxFV ranged from 1.81 to 9.94 per 1000 mosquitoes. In addition to the CxFV complete genome, one pool contained an ORF1 sequence (756 bp) that belongs to a novel Negevirus from the Sandewavirus supergroup most similar to the Santana virus (77.1%) and another pool presented an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase sequence (1081 bp) of a novel Rhabdovirus most similar to Wuhan mosquito virus 9 (44%). After three passages in C6/36 cells, only CxFV was isolated from these co-infected pools. The importance of ISVs relies on their possible ability to interfere with arbovirus replication in competent vectors.",Phosphoglycerate kinase deficiency: A nationwide multicenter retrospective study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30887539,Journal of inherited metabolic disease,2019 04 08,"Phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) deficiency is a rare X-linked metabolic disorder caused by mutations in the PGK1 gene.

In the Cambridge Study in Delinquent Development (CSDD), 411 London males have been followed up from age 8 to 48 in interviews, and from age 10 to 61 in criminal records; 19% were convicted for violence. There was a surprising amount of violence committed at older ages (40-61). The number of violence convictions was similar at ages 10-20, 21-39, and 40-61. There was considerable continuity in violent offending from ages 10-20 to 40-61. There was also continuity in self-reported violence from ages 15-18 to 43-48, and violence convictions were related to self-reported violence at all ages. The most important childhood risk factors for violence convictions were high daring or risk-taking, low verbal intelligence, a disrupted family, harsh parental discipline, high hyperactivity, and large family size. The extent to which these risk factors predicted violence at ages 40-61 was noteworthy. The ""integrated cognitive antisocial potential (ICAP)"" theory was proposed to explain the development of violence, and methods of preventing violence, targeting childhood risk factors, were reviewed.",Bronchial asthma triggered by house dust mites in patients with local allergic rhinitis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30887534,Allergy,2019 04 16,"Over 30% of local allergic rhinitis (LAR) patients self-report bronchial symptoms suggestive of asthma, but the relationship between the allergen exposure and the bronchial symptoms has not been studied.",Leaf mechanical strength and photosynthetic capacity vary independently across 57 subtropical forest species with contrasting light requirements.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30887533,The New phytologist,2019 04 13,"Leaf mechanical strength and photosynthetic capacity are critical plant life-history traits associated with tolerance and growth under various biotic and abiotic stresses. In principle, higher mechanical resistance achieved via higher relative allocation to cell walls should slow photosynthetic rates. However, interspecific relationships among these two leaf functions have not been reported. We measured leaf traits of 57 dominant woody species in a subtropical evergreen forest in China, focusing especially on photosynthetic rates, mechanical properties, and leaf lifespan (LLS). These species were assigned to two ecological strategy groups: shade-tolerant species and light-demanding species. On average, shade-tolerant species had longer LLS, higher leaf mechanical strength but lower photosynthetic rates, and exhibited longer LLS for a given leaf mass per area (LMA) or mechanical strength than light-demanding species. Depending on the traits and the basis of expression (per area or per mass), leaf mechanical resistance and photosynthetic capacity were either deemed unrelated, or only weakly negatively correlated. We found only weak support for the proposed trade-off between leaf biomechanics and photosynthesis among co-occurring woody species. This suggests there is considerable flexibility in these properties, and the observed relationships may result more so from trait coordination than any physically or physiologically enforced trade-off.",Diacylglycerol kinase and associated lipid mediators modulate rice root architecture.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30887532,The New phytologist,2019 06 03,"Diacylglycerol kinase (DGK) phosphorylates diacylglycerol (DAG) to generate phosphatidic acid (PA), and both DAG and PA are lipid mediators in the cell. Here we show that DGK1 in rice (Oryza sativa) plays important roles in root growth and development. Two independent OsDGK1-knockout (dgk1) lines exhibited a higher density of lateral roots (LRs) and thinner seminal roots (SRs), whereas OsDGK1-overexpressing plants displayed a lower LR density and thicker SRs than wild-type (WT) plants. Overexpression of OsDGK1 led to a decline in the DGK substrate DAG whereas specific PA species decreased in dgk1 roots. Supplementation of DAG to OsDGK1-overexpressing seedlings restored the LR density and SR thickness whereas application of PA to dgk1 seedlings restored the LR density and SR thickness to those of the WT. In addition, treatment of rice seedlings with the DGK inhibitor R59022 increased the level of DAG and decreased PA, which also restored the root phenotype of OsDGK1-overexpressing seedlings close to that of the WT. Together, these results indicate that DGK1 and associated lipid mediators modulate rice root architecture; DAG promotes LR formation and suppresses SR growth whereas PA suppresses LR number and promotes SR thickness.",Creating a culture of caring: A collaborative academic-practice approach to clinical education.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30887531,Nursing forum,2019 03 19,"Strong academic and practice partnerships are needed in the ever-changing health care environment. Sometimes an invisible barrier exists between clinical practice and academia; academic-practice partnerships are a way to bridge this barrier. Since 2008a team-based model of clinical education known as the Culture of Caring (COC) has brought together three academic institutions with a large hospital system to develop a unified clinical experience and curriculum that improves the student, provider, and patient experience. In the COC model the team consists of academic-practice leaders, clinical instructors, staff nurses, and students. Together they engage in a structured curriculum that is integrated into both the clinical environment and the academic setting. Each week of clinical the students focus on a topic that is paired with journal articles and learning activities that allow the team to engage in learning that is applicable to the clinical practice environment. The learning activities allow students to engage in learning about evidence-based practice and quality improvement initiatives that are taking place on the unit. The implementation of this collaborative approach to a clinical nursing education model has had a positive impact on the working relationships between the academic partners and clinical practice leaders."

However, very little is known about the expression of potassium ion channels and their function in cell survival and migration in these cells. Thus, the present study was designed to characterize potassium ion channels using electrophysiological and molecular biological approaches in S17 BMS cells. The whole-cell configuration of the patch clamp technique has been applied to identify potassium ion currents and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) used to determine their molecular identities. Based on gating kinetics and pharmacological modulation of the macroscopic currents we found the presence of four functional potassium ion channels in S17 BMS cells. These include a current rapidly activated and inactivated, tetraethylammonium-sensitive, (IKV ) in most (50%) cells; a fast activated and rapidly inactivating A-type K + current (IK A -like); a delayed rectifier K + current (IK DR ) and an inward rectifier potassium current (IK IR ), found in, respectively 4.5%, 26% and 24% of these cells. RT-PCR confirmed the presence of mRNA transcripts for the alpha subunit of the corresponding functional ion channels. Additionally, functional assays were performed to investigate the importance of potassium currents in cell survival and migration. 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide analyses revealed a reduction in cell viability, while wound healing assays revealed reduced migration potential in cells incubated with different potassium channel blockers. In conclusion, our data suggested that potassium currents might play a role in the maintenance of overall S17 cell ionic homeostasis directly affecting cell survival and migration.",Using systems thinking and open innovation to strengthen aquaculture policy for the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30887512,Journal of fish biology,2019 05 17,"In a world of 9 billion people and a widening income gap between the rich and poor, it is time to rethink how aquaculture can strengthen its contribution to the second UN Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) of zero hunger in our generation.

This paper offers a fresh look at the opportunities from using systems thinking and new open innovation measuring tools to grow sustainable aquaculture. Political will in many nations is the main constraint to aquaculture in realising its potential as an: accessible source of micronutrients and nutritious protein; aid to meeting conservation goals; economic prosperity generator where benefits extend to locals and provider of indirect social benefits such as access to education and well-being, among others.

However, lncRNA-MEG3's function in cattle growth and regulatory mechanism on bovine skeletal muscle development has not yet been well studied. In this project, we first investigated lncRNA-MEG3's expression profile and detected that it was highly expressed in bovine skeletal muscle tissue and its RNA level was kept increasingly during the early phase of bovine primary myoblast differentiation. Using luciferase reporter assays, we identified the lncRNA-MEG3 core promoter containing putative transcription factor binding site for myocyte enhancer factor 2C (MEF2C). Interestingly, we found that LncRNA-MEG3 could significantly upregulate and downregulate myosin heavy chain ( MHC), myogenin ( MyoG), and MEF2C through overexpression and RNAi strategies, respectively. Using luciferase reporter assays, we also verified lncRNA-MEG3 as a miR-135 sponge. Overexpression of miR-135 markedly inhibited the wild type of lncRNA-MEG3, but not the mutant lncRNA-MEG3 reporter. The luciferase activity of miR-135 sensor could be rescued by lncRNA-MEG3 via competing for miRNA-135. In addition, the luciferase activity of MEF2C was significantly upregulated by the wild type of lncRNA-MEG3. This study, for the first time, revealed that lncRNA-MEG3 could promote bovine skeletal muscle differentiation via interacting with miRNA-135 and MEF2C. The results were valuable for further studies and applications of lncRNA related roles in beef molecular breeding.",Cognitive heuristics in borderline personality disorder across treatment: A longitudinal non-parametric analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30887510,Journal of clinical psychology,2019 06 11,The development of a constructive therapeutic alliance may represent an important feature of interpersonal adaptation in clients with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD).

Immunological alterations are involved in the pathogenesis of endometriosis, and STAT4 polymorphisms may be linked to disease development.

This case-control study's sample comprised 238 women with endometriosis and 201 healthy, fertile women without endometriosis (which was surgically confirmed). Genotyping was performed using the TaqMan system with a real-time polymerase chain reaction; the genotype, allele, and haplotype frequencies were then compared between groups. A single-polymorphism analysis revealed that the TT genotype of the rs7574865/T > G polymorphism was significantly more frequent in women with minimal or mild endometriosis than in the controls (10% vs. 5%, p = 0.047). The CGAC, GTAT, and GTAC haplotypes were significantly more frequent in the women with endometriosis-related infertility (5.8%, 4.1%, and 2.9%, respectively) than in the controls (2.4%, 1.1%, and 0.8%, respectively; p = 0.020, p = 0.011, and p = 0.032, respectively), but the GGGC and CTAT haplotypes were significantly more prevalent in the control group (34.7% and 13.9%, respectively) than among the infertile group (26.2% and 9.1%, respectively). In addition, the CGAC haplotype was more frequently found in those with minimal or mild endometriosis (6.8%) than in the controls (2.4%, p = 0.009), and the GTAT haplotype was more commonly found in those with moderate or severe disease (3.6%) than in the controls (1.1%, p = 0.028).

Studies have suggested that microRNAs (miRNAs) play an important role in BDC progression. Here we aim at investigating the effects of miR-329 on BDC development, focusing especially on epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in vitro and lymph node metastasis in vivo. Expression microarrays associated with BDC tissues were collected and differentially expressed genes were analyzed, followed by miRNA target prediction and verification. The role miR-329 played in BDC was examined using gain-of-function and loss-of-function methods. The expressions of miR-329, laminin subunit beta 3 (LAMB3), and EMT markers, in addition to cell proliferation, migration, and invasion were evaluated. Furthermore, nude mice models of BDC were established to observe tumor growth and metastatic lymph nodes. The LAMB3 was identified as an upregulated gene based on the GSE77984 and GSE45001 microarray analysis. LAMB3 was also predicted and confirmed to be a target gene of miR-329 by dual-luciferase reporter assay. Through further cell experiments, the EMT process was reversed, cell proliferation, invasion, and migration were suppressed, when miR-329 was upregulated. Furthermore, in vivo experiments exhibited that the overexpression of miR-329 inhibited tumor growth and the number of metastatic lymph nodes. This study provides in vivo and in vitro evidence that miR-329 inhibits BDC progression through translational repression of LAMB3. Therefore, the obtained results may aid as an experimental basis for improving prognosis of BDC.",Paid Family Leave: An Emerging Benefit for Employed Family Caregivers of Older Adults.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30887507,Journal of the American Geriatrics Society,2019 03 19,"As our population ages, the ability to take time off to care for an ill family member or close friend without losing income or a job is a growing social, health, and economic issue for American families. Therefore, the need for paid family leave policies for workers with caregiving responsibilities is an important topic for employers and policymakers, in the clinical care of older adults, and at kitchen tables across the United States. Despite this growing need, paid family leave is not available to most workers, and there is no national paid family leave policy. Health care and social service providers have a role in ensuring that family members of their patients with a serious health condition or disability are aware of the potential availability of paid family leave benefits in the states and businesses that provide them. Building a better system of care for older adults means changes not only in health care settings and in long-term services and supports, but in workplaces too. This article describes the challenges faced by workers with family caregiving responsibilities, explains why paid family leave matters, indicates which states have adopted these protections, and reviews research on existing paid family leave policies.

Scale growth was proportional to fish growth across all treatments, justifying the use of scale measurements as a proxy for growth during the early marine phase. The rate of circuli deposition was dependant on temperature and feeding regime and was generally proportional to fish growth but with some decoupling of the relationship at 15°C. Deposition rates varied from 4.8 days per circulus at 15°C (constant feeding) to 15.1 days per circulus at 6°C (interrupted feeding). Cumulative degree day (° D) was a better predictor of circuli number than age, although the rate of circuli deposition ° D-1 was significantly lower at 6°C compared with 15 and 10.5°C. Inter-circuli distances were highly variable and did not reflect growth rate; tightly packed circuli occurred during periods without food when growth was depressed, but also during periods of rapid growth at 15°C. The results further current understanding of scale growth properties and can inform investigations of declining marine growth in S. salar based on interpretations of scale growth patterns."

The authors review a novel optical coagulation profiler that measures several coagulation metrics including prothrombin time, activated clotting time, clot polymerization rate (α-angle), clot stiffness (maximum amplitude), fibrinolysis (LY), and platelet function, using a single multifunctional instrument. The optical profiler is based on the principles of Laser Speckle Rheology that quantifies tissue viscoelasticity from light scattering patterns called laser speckle. To operate the optical profiler, whole blood (40 μL) is loaded into a disposable cartridge, laser speckle patterns are recorded via a camera, and the viscoelasticity of clotting blood is estimated from speckle intensity fluctuations. By monitoring alterations in viscoelastic moduli over time during clot initiation, thrombin generation, fibrin crosslinking, clot stabilization, and LY, global coagulation parameters are obtained within 10 minutes using a drop of whole blood. Clinical testing in over 500 patients to date has confirmed the accuracy of the optical profiler for comprehensively assessing coagulation status against conventional coagulation tests and thromboelastography. Recent studies have further demonstrated the capability to quantify platelet aggregation induced by adenosine diphosphate in a drop of platelet-rich-plasma in the absence of applied shear stress. Together, these studies demonstrate that global coagulation profiling in addition to platelet function may be accomplished using a single multifunctional device. Thus, by enabling rapid and comprehensive coagulation and platelet function profiling at the bedside, the optical profiler will likely advance the capability to identify and manage patients with an elevated risk for hemorrhage.",Novel Coagulation Analyzers in Development: A Glimpse toward the Future of Microfluidics.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30887485,Seminars in thrombosis and hemostasis,2019 04 22,"Coagulation diagnostic testing in pediatric patients currently requires large volume blood sampling and is performed on analyzers that are not well-suited for multiplexed assays on a given sample.

The performance was determined at fixed (2 and 4 mmol/l serum lactate) and individual (individual anaerobic threshold (IAT) and lactate equivalent (LAE)) thresholds. Data from the last available test were compared between skiers who later advanced to the professional level (Austrian national ski team) and those who did not. Ninety-seven alpine skiers (n=51 male; n=46 female); mean age 16.6 years (range 15-18) were included. Of these, 18 adolescents (n=10 male; n=8 female) entered a professional career. No significant differences were found for maximum oxygen uptake (VO2max). Athletes advancing to the professional level had significantly higher performance and VO2 at LAE. Additionally, male professionals had significantly higher performances at fixed thresholds and the IAT. The performance and VO2 at the LAE, and thus the ability to produce power at a particular metabolic threshold, was the most relevant spiroergometric parameter to predict a later professional career.",Modelling the Acceleration and Deceleration Profile of Elite-level Soccer Players.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30887482,International journal of sports medicine,2019 06 13,"The ability to change velocity rapidly is a key element of field-based sports. This study quantified the acceleration and deceleration profiles of soccer players during match play. Global positioning system measures were collected from 20 male soccer players competing in the Australian Hyundai A-League during 58 matches. Match data were organized into ten 9 min periods (i. e., P1: 0-9 min) and the time spent at moderate (1-2 m·s-2) and high (>2 m·s-2) acceleration and deceleration thresholds were quantified. Additionally, a novel deceleration: acceleration ratio was quantified to identify the transient nature of deceleration activity. Linear mixed models were used to model the acceleration and deceleration profiles. All acceleration and deceleration metrics displayed negative logarithmic curves within each half. There was no change in the ratio of high deceleration: acceleration; however, a significant increase in the ratio of moderate deceleration:acceleration was evident. Using negative logarithmic curves to illustrate the acceleration and deceleration decay provides a novel methodological approach to quantify the high-intensity actions during match play. A decrease in the time spent decelerating throughout a match may be attributed to a lack of opportunity.

The findings showed the volume, intensity and types of TL accrued influences the relationship with physical performance that suggest the significance of phase-specific monitoring of TL for maximizing performance in soccer players.",The Clinical and Cost Effectiveness of Inotuzumab Ozogamicin for the Treatment of Adult Relapsed or Refractory B-Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia: An Evidence Review Group Evaluation of a NICE Single Technology Appraisal.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30887470,PharmacoEconomics,2019 03 19,"The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) invited Pfizer, the manufacturer of inotuzumab ozogamicin (henceforth inotuzumab), to submit clinical- and cost-effectiveness evidence for inotuzumab as part of NICE's single technology appraisal process. The Centre for Reviews and Dissemination and the Centre for Health Economics, both at the University of York, were commissioned as the independent evidence review group (ERG). The clinical-effectiveness data were from a multicentre randomised controlled trial that compared inotuzumab with standard of care (SoC), where SoC was the investigator's choice of chemotherapy. Inotuzumab demonstrated statistically significant improvements in response rates or in the proportion of patients progressing to haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) but failed to meet the second primary objective of longer overall survival. Treatment-emergent adverse events were more frequent in the SoC arm, except veno-occlusive disease, which was more frequent in the inotuzumab arm. The company's economic model split patients into three post-hoc subgroups and used a partitioned survival approach within each group, with a cure assumption 3 years after receiving HSCT. In contrast with the trial results, the economic model estimated substantial improvement in survival with inotuzumab compared with SoC, providing an additional 5.2 life-years and 2.2 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) using a discount rate of 1.5% per annum. The ERG's critique highlighted a number of concerns, including the use of a post-hoc post-randomisation patient subset for extrapolation, the choice of a 1.5% discount rate, the complexity of the parametric modelling, the assumption of further treatment benefit post-HSCT, the nature of the cure assumption, and the length of inpatient stay while receiving treatment. The combination of the ERG's adjustments resulted in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of £122,174 per QALY gained using Kaplan-Meier survival estimates and £114,078 per QALY gained with parametric survival models fit to the trial data. The final determination of the appraisal followed four NICE Appraisal Committee meetings, an appeal by the company and other stakeholders, two patient access schemes, and a company response to each appraisal consultation. The final ICER post-consultation was between £33,749 and £37,497 per QALY gained compared with SoC (excluding the confidential discount for blinatumomab received as subsequent therapy). The Appraisal Committee concluded that the ICER for inotuzumab was within the range usually considered cost effective for end-of-life care and recommended inotuzumab within its licensed indication.",Spillover Effects on Caregivers' and Family Members' Utility: A Systematic Review of the Literature.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30887469,PharmacoEconomics,2019 04 19,"A growing body of research has identified health-related quality-of-life effects for caregivers and family members of ill patients (i.e. 'spillover effects'), yet these are rarely considered in cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs).",Laparoscopic cholecystectomy: do risk factors for a prolonged length of stay exist?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30887468,Updates in surgery,2019 03 19,"Gallstones are one of the most common morbidities in the world. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is the gold standard for gallbladder stones' removal. Few studies focus on the existence of predictive factors aimed at facilitating cholecystectomy in a day surgery setting. The aim of this retrospective study was to identify clinical factors that could guide day-surgery laparoscopic cholecystectomy safety. The study included 985 consecutive patients who underwent elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy for gallstone disease between May 2006 and February 2015. Patients were divided into two groups: group A with a length of stay ≤ 2 days (922 patients); group B with a length of stay > 2 days (63 patients). Univariate analysis showed that age, sex and the presence of obesity, cardiological, and nephrological comorbidities had a higher likelihood of a longer hospital stay. The logistic regression model showed that only age was a significant predictor of a longer stay. No complication has reached the statistical significance of extending the length of stay in group B. Conversely, the presence of such comorbidities has influenced the hospitalization. Our results allow the identification of a category of patients at high risk of hospitalization within 1 or 2 days from treatment. Moreover, we reported that there is no complication specifically affecting the length of stay. Our findings support the idea that a prolonged length of stay is not linked to the surgical procedure but to the patient's comorbidities.",D-shape asymmetric excision in recurrent pilonidalis disease: an analytic longitudinal long-term evaluation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30887467,Updates in surgery,2019 03 19,"Sacrococcigeal pilonidalis disease (SPD) recurrence is a major factor influencing surgical outcomes. Several different surgical treatments have been reported, however, there is a lack of long-term data on reoperation. Aim of this study was to analyze outcomes of a single center adopting a standardized off-midline asymmetric procedure (D-shape). Analytic longitudinal assessment of 83 patients (median age 35 years, range 23-59 years) with recurrent SPD that completed the 5-year study design following D-shape reoperation. Among a cohort of 607 patients, we enrolled 83 recurrent SPD. After D-shape reoperation, second recurrence rate was 9.6% (8/83). Second recurrence rate was not statistically significantly different among patients undergone D-shape as first surgery compared to patients of symmetric excision group (11.8% vs. 7.4%, p = 0.57). Similarly, there was no statistical difference among patients who underwent D-shape as first surgery compared to patients who underwent symmetric excision elsewhere (11.8% vs. 9.1%, p = .75). D-shape is a safe and effective when adopted as revisional surgery at a long-term follow-up. Comparative evaluation is warranted to establish the potential superiority over different surgical surgery in case of recurrence."

In this paper, a least-square support-vector machine (LS-SVM) was employed to construct models for the prediction of effluent chemical oxygen demand (COD) in an anaerobic wastewater treatment system. The result revealed that the performance of the steady-state model based on LS-SVM for predicting effluent COD was acceptable, with the maximum relative error (RE) of 11.45%, the mean average percentage error (MAPE) of 0.79% and the root mean square error (RMSE) of 3.08 when training, and the performance fell slightly when testing. Even though, the correlation coefficient value (R) between the predicted value and the actual value of 0.9752 could be achieved, which means this model can predict the variation of effluent COD in general. The dynamic-state models under three kinds of shock loads, which were concentration, hydraulic, and bicarbonate buffer absent, showed good forecasting performance, the correlation coefficient values (R) all excelled 0.99. Among these three shocks, the dynamic LS-SVM model under bicarbonate buffer absent shock achieved the optimal performance and followed by the dynamic-state model under hydraulic shock. This paper provides a meaningful reference to improve the monitoring level of the anaerobic wastewater treatment process.",Nutritional and toxicity constraints of phytoplankton from a Brazilian reservoir to the fitness of cladoceran species.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30887454,Environmental science and pollution research international,2019 04 26,"Camorim is a small, eutrophic reservoir in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, with a phytoplankton community dominated most of the year by the filamentous diatom Aulacoseira spp. and the toxic cyanobacterium Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii. As filamentous species can be a poor food for grazers, we hypothesize that phytoplankton from this reservoir would constrain cladoceran fitness due to nutritional limitation and/or toxicity when animals fed mixtures of cultured green algae and natural seston. Clones of different cladoceran species were exposed either to seston from Camorim reservoir sampled in different seasons or to a C. raciborskii strain (CYLCAM-2) isolated from the reservoir. In short-term assays, cladocerans were exposed to either 100% seston or mixtures of 50% seston added to green algae (200 μg C L-1), and their survivorship and somatic growth were measured for 4 days. In life table assays, neonates were exposed to the same seston treatments over 14 days and age at first reproduction, survivorship, fecundity, total offspring, and the intrinsic rate of natural increase (r) were assessed. In general, seston negatively affected cladoceran survivorship and fitness (r), but this response was seasonally and species specific. Stronger effects of CYLCAM-2 than those caused by seston on survivorship, somatic growth, and r were found for all cladoceran species, especially when the proportion of CYLCAM-2 was higher than 50% in relation to green algae in a fixed total food concentration. Our results suggest that both nutritional (C/P and morphology) and toxicity factors can act to impair cladoceran fitness and help explain the absence of cladocerans in Camorim reservoir.",Does combined heat and power mitigate CO2 emissions? A cross-country analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30887453,Environmental science and pollution research international,2019 06 13,"Combined heat and power (CHP), which produces both heat and electricity at the same time, is so efficient that it can reduce energy use and emit less carbon dioxide (CO2) than conventional fossil fuel use. This article attempts to look empirically into the impact of CHP share in total electricity generation on CO2 emissions in a cross-country context. Data from 35 countries during the period 2009-2015 are used. For this purpose, the variable of CO2 emissions is regressed on three variables of constant, gross domestic product, and CHP share using two robust estimators. The results show that the level of CHP share of a country affects the level of its CO2 emissions negatively. That is, CHP leads to less CO2 emissions.",Organohalogenated pollutants in raw and UHT cow's milk from Turkey: a risk assessment of dietary intake.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30887452,Environmental science and pollution research international,2019 04 26,"In this study, health risk of human exposure to organohalogenated pollutants (OHPs) through milk consumption was determined. Conventionally produced, unprocessed cow's milk samples taken from Konya District, in Turkey, and 15 different brand ultra-high-temperature (UHT) processed cow's milk samples taken from supermarkets of Turkey were analyzed for organochlorine pesticides (OCPs, α-, β-, γ-, and δ-HCHs, p,p'-DDE, p,p'-DDD, and p,p'-DDT, heptachlor, heptachlor epoxide, endosulfan I, endosulfan II, endosulfan sulfate, endrin, endrin aldehyde, endrin ketone, aldrin + dieldrin, methoxychlor), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs, PCB 28, 52, 101, 153, 138, and 180), and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs, PBDE 47, 99, 100, 153, and 154 congeners). Estimated daily intake (EDI) values calculated for both adults and children consuming raw or UHT milk were determined to exceed maximum residue limits (MRLs) set for γ-HCH, ∑Heptachlor, and endrin. EDI values also exceeded admissible daily intake (ADI) values given for ∑HCH, ∑Heptachlor, ∑Endrin aldrin + dieldrin, and ∑PCBs. p,p'-DDT/p,p'-DDE ratio was 1 or higher for 66% of the milk samples, which is an indication of sustaining illegal use of DDT.

Phanerochaete chrysosporium, ME 446, was kept at 4 °C after being sub-cultured at 28 °C on Sabouraud Dextrose Agar (SDA). Superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) activities, and malaondialdehyde (MDA) and glutathione (GSH) levels of P. chrysosporium exposed to different dilution rates of leachate (1/10 and 1/20) for 24 and 96 h were analyzed by using the ELISA method. The physiochemical parameters such as pH, conductivity, total dissolved solids (TDS), dissolved oxygen (DO), chemical oxygen demand (COD) of leachate, and reference water were analyzed by using the YSI Professional Plus handheld multiparameter meter. In this study, SOD activities were decreased in the application groups compared with the Control Group at the 24th and 96th hours.

Multi-elemental, infrared spectra, 137Cs, 210Pb, and diatom analyses in a 75-cm sediment core were used to reconstruct the recent disturbance history of the lake. The sequence chronology, based mostly on 137Cs profiles, allowed to infer high sedimentation rates in Balamtetik (~ 7 mm/year) and a nearly cyclic series of disturbance events that can be related to anthropogenic causes such as deforestation and increased development of agriculture and urban areas at local and regional scale. These disturbance events show high local and regional erosion (high Ca, TIC, and Ti), soil organic matter (IR spectra), eutrophication (high P and diatoms), and anoxic bottom water conditions (low Mn) and can be dated to the early 1950s, the late 1950s, and from the 1980s until the 2000s. The entrance of wastewaters is related with an increase in salinity inferred by the diatom record and the organic matter type. The first two disturbance events are related to changes in land use during the agrarian reform that started during the 1940s; the last event is related with the increase in local population and the introduction of intensive agriculture. This last phase of disturbance corresponds with the reports of fish mortality events around 2003; however, high lake turbidity and anoxic bottom waters seem to have been established since the 1980s. The record from Lake Balamtetik also shows that during the intermediate periods, there was a recovery of the lake and its catchment; however, the future trends might be different, as the increase in the speed of organic matter and nutrients arrival to the lake reduces its resilience.",Distribution and emission characteristics of filterable and condensable particulate matter before and after a low-low temperature electrostatic precipitator.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30887449,Environmental science and pollution research international,2019 04 26,"The low-low temperature electrostatic precipitator (LLT-ESP), a combination of a traditional temperature electrostatic precipitator (ESP) and a non-leakage media gas-gas exchange (MGGH), could reduce the inlet flue gas temperature below the dew point and improved the performance of the ESP. Particulate matter (PM) from the stationary sources contains filterable particulate matter (FPM) and condensable particulate matter (CPM). In this study, coal with a high ash content (coal-HA) was burned, and the emission characteristics and removal efficiencies of the particulate matter in an LLT-ESP were investigated. The standards used to test filterable and condensable PM were ISO standard 23210-2009 and U.S. EPA Method 202, respectively. The LLT-ESP was efficient in removing filterable PM, with a total filterable PM removal efficiency as high as 99.6%. The removal efficiency of filterable PM increased with increasing particulate size and decreasing imported flue gas temperature. The LLT-ESP also provided excellent removal of condensable PM with a condensable PM removal efficiency exceeding 77%. Upstream of the LLT-ESP, the concentrations of filterable PM were much higher than those of condensable PM. Downstream of the LLT-ESP, the relationship between the quantities of condensable and filterable PM reversed. To reduce the emissions of PM from coal-fired power plants, more attention should be paid to controlling condensable PM. The temperature of the flue gas upstream of the LLT-ESP played an important role in eliminating condensable PM. At lower imported flue gas temperature operation conditions, the removal efficiency of the LLT-ESP for the condensable PM and the escaping mass concentration of condensable PM increased. Among the organic fraction of the condensable PM, hydrocarbons and esters were dominant. Meanwhile, SO42- was the primary component, followed by Cl- in anions. Na+, Ca2+, and Fe3+ were the main components in metal ions. Particles with diameters ≥ 10 μm, which contained most of the Si and Al, were dominant in the fly ash collected from sections 1 and 2 of the LLT-ESP. The main particles in sections 3 and 4 were PM10, which contained the highest concentrations of Ca and Fe.",To prepare or not to prepare? When preparation of a response in Task 2 induces extra performance costs in Task 1.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30887448,Psychonomic bulletin & review,2019 05 02,"In dual tasking, the no-go backward crosstalk effect (BCE) means that processing of Task 1 takes longer when Task 2 does not require a response (no-go trial) than when it requires a response (go trial). Thus, contrary to the usual observation, giving two successive responses counterintuitively reduces instead of increases performance costs for Task 1. Results from recent studies are in line with the notion that the no-go BCE reflects response inhibition, which is required to overcome an already prepared go response in Task 2, but which also spills over to motor execution in Task 1. No direct test of this hypothesis, however, has been carried out so far, and hence the present study was designed to fill this gap. The result of this study with n = 48 participants revealed that a no-go Task 2 impeded Task 1 performance when preparation of the Task 2 response was encouraged, but facilitated Task 1 performance when preparation of the Task 2 response was not encouraged.",Modality-specific forgetting.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30887447,Psychonomic bulletin & review,2019 05 02,"A large body of literature agrees that accessing a target memory appears to trigger a difference-of-Gaussian memory activation pulse under which the target representation is activated and categorically flanking items are suppressed and forgotten. The nature of the underlying forgetting mechanism is far from settled, with support for several theories of forgetting. Here we argue the debate is partly fueled by different forgetting mechanisms underlying the forgetting of different memoranda. We capitalized on the unique aspect of the recognition-induced forgetting paradigm to test forgetting of both pictures and words in identical recognition-practice and restudy tasks. We found that memory for pictures and words followed different patterns of forgetting. Specifically, forgetting was retrieval specific for words, in that forgetting occurred only when words were recognized, and not when words were merely restudied. However, forgetting was not retrieval specific for pictures, in that forgetting occurred both when pictures were recognized as well as restudied. Further, patterns of forgetting operated along different category-level groupings for pictures and words. Words grouped along the superordinate level were susceptible to forgetting but pictures were not. The strength of this design is the ability to directly compare forgetting for different memoranda, establishing that patterns of forgetting are modality specific. These findings demonstrate that the mechanisms underlying forgetting may differ as a function of the particular memoranda, emphasizing the need for examining forgetting in long-term memory across modalities."

It is a single-strength tablet housed in a single-dose applicator (which may minimize the likelihood of dosing errors) and is strictly for use in medically supervised/monitored settings. It is administered by a healthcare professional and has a minimum re-dose interval of 1 h and no drug delivery setup requirements. In placebo-controlled or noncomparative phase 2 or 3 trials, the sufentanil ST provided effective analgesia for adults with moderate to severe acute pain due to surgery or trauma/injury, reducing the intensity of pain within 15-30 min after the first dose and maintaining analgesic benefit over the 2-24 h study periods. Such short-term use of the sufentanil ST was also generally well tolerated. Studies directly comparing the sufentanil ST with other opioids in terms of efficacy, tolerability, usability and cost effectiveness would be beneficial, as would analyses of its abuse potential, given sufentanil is considerably more potent than fentanyl or morphine. In the meantime, current data indicate that the sufentanil ST is a noninvasive, fast-acting, opioid formulation for managing moderate to severe acute pain in medically supervised/monitored settings that may be of particular use when oral or intravenous opioid analgesia is not possible/feasible.",White matter microstructure relates to lassitude but not diagnosis in adolescents with depression.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30887416,Brain imaging and behavior,2019 03 29,"The neurobiology of adolescent depression remains poorly understood. Initial studies suggested impaired white matter microstructure in adults and adolescents, but findings have not been consistent. Challenges in this literature have included small samples, medication confounds and inconsistent correction for type I error. This study addressed these issues in a new examination of fractional anisotropy (FA) in adolescents with major depressive disorder (MDD) using diffusion tensor imaging. We examined FA in 81 adolescents aged 12-19 (44 MDD [all unmedicated], 37 controls). We conducted logistic regression analyses to examine the odds of MDD versus control based on FA within standard white matter tracts that were delineated by probabilistic tractography. We also examined relationships between FA and disease severity (overall depression and dimensions of illness). Finally, we conducted a voxel-wise group comparison of FA. All analyses covaried for age, sex and socioeconomic status, and applied rigorous corrections for multiple testing. Logistic regression did not reveal significant associations between diagnosis and FA within white matter tracts defined by probabilistic tractography. Dimensional analyses revealed that greater lassitude was associated with higher FA in right cingulum bundle and bilateral corticospinal tracts, but with lower FA in right anterior thalamic radiation. Voxel-wise group comparisons of FA did not reveal significant group differences. The current findings do not support low FA as a neurobiological marker of adolescent depression.

However, manipulation of the console by physicians themselves may not be possible because their hands may be otherwise engaged. In this study, an image manipulation system using an electroencephalogram (EEG) sensor mounted on the operator's head was developed. In this system, data acquired by the device is used to manipulate images, and the output can be converted to commands for various actions such as paging, which can be controlled by the operator's eye-blink, and zooming of a region indicated by the cursor, which can be controlled by the operator's mental concentration. In this study, the MindWave Mobile headset was used as EEG sensor, and AZEWIN for the display system. Ten observers were enrolled and fitted with EEG device to determine the threshold values of blink strength and attention; threshold value of 100 for blink strength and 65 for attention were determined. Thirty-one observers were enrolled and fitted with EEG device to investigate average response-time; the average response time for detecting paging was 0.43 ± 0.02 s, and that for zooming was 5.85 ± 0.56 s. Thus, the proposed image manipulation system using the operator's EEG signals enabled physicians to assess and manipulate images without using their hands.",Thermally Induced Denaturing Energetics of Human Blood Plasma Albumin by Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) as an Indicator for Breast Cancer Diagnosis in Female Patients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30887400,AAPS PharmSciTech,2019 05 22,"Cancerous invasion yields unusual metabolisms providing a significant amount of peptide albuminomes that modulate albumin stability via binding. The study aimed at the investigation of the thermal stability of human plasma albumin with breast cancer of various stages by means of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Blood plasma was drawn from 11 female breast cancer patients and 50 healthy volunteers of homogeneous demographics. Plasma samples and their albumin-enriched fractions were subjected to DSC scanning between 37 and 90°C at 5°C/min rate. For normal blood plasma, a characteristic signature of DSC tracing was observed. And, the deconvolution of DSC thermograms revealed the recognition of thermal transition of albumin. It was found that denaturing temperature of albumin increased with increasing breast cancer staging which implied the increase in albuminome/peptide abundance produced by cancerous invasion. The analysis of albumin denaturing energetics based on rational approximation of the simple Lumry-Eyring model demonstrated that thermal transition of free albumin and albuminome-bound form attained energetic levels expressed as apparent activation energy (Eapp ± s.e.) of 132.68 ± 14.21 and 46.76 ± 8.42 Kcal/mol corresponded to the schemes dominated by irreversible alteration and by reversible unfolding, respectively. Thus, Eapp value may indicate the degrees of cancerous invasion. It was proposed that Eapp may be used as an indicator to diagnose and assess the prognosis of breast cancer.",Diabetes Disparities and Promising Interventions to Address Diabetes in Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander Populations.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30887399,Current diabetes reports,2019 05 10,The Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander (NHPI) population is rapidly growing in the USA.

Whilst much interest has focussed on cross-sectional techniques such as postmortem CT (PMCT) or MRI (PMMR), other modalities including postmortem ultrasound (PMUS) have been shown to have reasonable diagnostic accuracy rates, with the added benefit of being more readily accessible and affordable. There is little published information or formal guidance available on preparation for postmortem perinatal ultrasound, views to be obtained and differentiating normal postmortem change from potential abnormalities.This article will focus on the role of perinatal postmortem ultrasound as an alternative imaging method for non-invasive autopsy, with emphasis on imaging technique, practical considerations and commonly encountered case examples.",The Deleterious Impact of Interleukin 9 to Hepatorenal Physiology.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30887397,Inflammation,2019 03 19,"IL-9 is a pleiotropic cytokine, recently recognized as belonging to Th9 cells that are involved in various pathologies. We aimed to evaluate the role of IL-9 in the course of hepatic and renal fibrosis. Female C57BL/6 mice were treated subcutaneously with IL-9 10 ng/mouse and 20 ng/mouse for 40 days, alternating every 5 days each application, the negative control of which was treated with PBS and positive control with CCL4. IL-9 demonstrated fibrogenic activity, leading to increased collagen I and III deposition in both liver and kidney, as well as triggering lobular hepatitis. In addition, IL-9 induced an inflammatory response with recruitment of lymphocytes, neutrophils, and macrophages to both organs. The inflammation was present in the region of the portal and parenchymal zone in the liver and in the cortical and medullary zone in the kidney. IL-9 deregulated liver and kidney antioxidant activities. Our results showed that IL-9 was able to promote hepatorenal dysfunction. Moreover, IL-9 poses as a promising target for therapeutic interventions.",Dihydromyricetin Alleviates Sepsis-Induced Acute Lung Injury through Inhibiting NLRP3 Inflammasome-Dependent Pyroptosis in Mice Model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30887396,Inflammation,2019 03 19,"Increasing evidence demonstrates that pyroptosis, pro-inflammatory programmed cell death, is linked to acute lung injury (ALI). Dihydromyricetin (DHM) has been reported to exert anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome activation in vascular endothelial cells. However, the effects of DHM on NLRP3 inflammasome-induced pyroptosis in ALI remain elusive. In the present study, male BALB/c mice were subjected to cecal ligation and puncture (CLP), and DHM (50, 100, 150 mg/kg) was orally administered (once per day, for 3 days) 2 h after CLP. After 72 h, lung histopathology was examined, and the wet/dry (W/D) ratio, inflammatory infiltration, total protein concentration, total cell, and neutrophil counts were detected. Myeloperoxidase (MPO), interleukin (IL)-6, TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-18 levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were measured by ELISA. Additionally, the expression of NLRP3 signaling pathway proteins were detected by Western blotting. The results revealed that in BALF, DHM (150 mg/kg) treatment significantly reduced the CLP-induced lung histopathological injury, inflammatory cell infiltration, total cell and neutrophil number, and total protein and albumin concentration. DHM treatment significantly inhibited the CLP-induced NLRP3 inflammasome pathway (NLRP3, ASC, caspase-1, gasdermin D (Gsdmd), IL-1β, and IL-18). In conclusion, these results demonstrate that DHM protects against CLP-induced ALI by inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome activation and subsequent pyroptosis.",CTRP3 Alleviates Ox-LDL-Induced Inflammatory Response and Endothelial Dysfunction in Mouse Aortic Endothelial Cells by Activating the PI3K/Akt/eNOS Pathway.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30887395,Inflammation,2019 03 19,"C1q/tumor necrosis factor-related protein-3 (CTRP3) is a novel, certified, adipokine that beneficially regulates metabolism and inflammation in the cardiovascular system. Atherosclerotic plaque rupturing and secondary thrombosis cause vascular disorders, such as myocardial infarction and unstable angina. However, the underlying role of CTRP3 in atherosclerosis remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to elucidate whether and how CTRP3 ameliorates inflammation and endothelial dysfunction caused by oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL). We first confirmed that CTRP3 expression was inhibited in ApoE-/- mice, compared to normal mice. Then, pcDNA-CTRP3 and siCTRP3 were transfected into mouse aortic endothelial cells after ox-LDL stimulation, and we observed that enhanced CTRP3 remarkably downregulated CRP, TNF-α, IL-6, CD40, and CD40L. We also observed that overexpression of CTRP3 elevated cell activity and decreased lactated hydrogenase release, accompanied by a marked reduction in cell apoptosis induced by ox-LDL. Meanwhile, overexpressed CTRP3 caused a decrease in Ang II, ICAM-1, and VCAM-1 expression, and it restored the balance between ET-1 and NO. Mechanism analysis confirmed that incremental CTRP3 upregulated p-PI3K, p-Akt, and p-eNOS expression, indicating that CTRP3 facilitated activation of the PI3K/Akt/eNOS pathway. On the contrary, siCTRP3 exerted the opposite effect to this activation. Blocking these pathways using LY294002 or L-NAME attenuated the protective role of CTRP3. Overall, these results suggest that CTRP3 can efficiently inhibit the inflammatory response and endothelial dysfunction induced by ox-LDL in mouse aortic endothelial cells, perhaps by activating the PI3K/Akt/eNOS pathway, indicating a promising strategy against atherosclerosis.",Oral Epithelial Dysplasia and Premalignancy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30887394,Head and neck pathology,2019 03 19,"Leukoplakia and erythroplakia are two entities under the moniker of ""oral potentially malignant disorders"" that are highly associated with the presence of oral epithelial dysplasia (OED) at first biopsy, while lesions of submucous fibrosis develop OED after being present for years. Importantly, traumatic/frictional keratoses are often mistaken clinically for leukoplakia and it is important for the pathologist to recognize and report them as such. The features of OED have been well-described and other architectural features will be discussed here, in particular verrucous and papillary architecture, bulky epithelial proliferation and epithelial atrophy. Proliferative leukoplakia, verrucous or otherwise, often show only hyperkeratosis in early lesions, with development of OED occurring over time, and squamous cell carcinoma developing in the majority of cases over time. The concept of hyperkeratosis without features of OED and that is not reactive, is likely a precursor to the dysplastic phenotype. Many cases of leukoplakia exhibiting OED are associated with a band of lymphocytes at the interface and these should not be mistaken for oral lichen planus.",Current Challenges in the Staging of Oral Cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30887393,Head and neck pathology,2019 03 19,"In the recently published 8th edition of the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual, new pathological elements are required for the N and T category determinations for oral cavity cancers. This includes determination of depth of tumor invasion and assessment of metastatic lymph nodes for extranodal extension. Although definitions and some guidance are provided for the interpretation of these elements, pathologists frequently encounter ambiguous situations that may result in interobserver and intraobserver variability. Pre-existing staging elements, such as assessment of bone invasion, can also be problematic to interpret. Difficulties in the interpretation of depth of invasion, bone invasion and extranodal invasion are discussed, with examples. Communication with the surgeon, proper specimen orientation, gross examination and sampling are crucial to assessment of these elements. Liberal use of deeper levels and submission of additional sections is suggested. Although general staging guidelines encourage clinicians and pathologists to choose the lower category when there is ambiguity, pathologists may choose to discuss difficulties in the interpretation of specific cases at interdisciplinary tumor boards, to allow a more informed choice of treatment on the part of treating physician and patient. More discussion is required among pathologists to develop specific guidelines for the interpretation of these staging elements.",Challenges in Minor Salivary Gland Biopsies: A Practical Approach to Problematic Histologic Patterns.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30887392,Head and neck pathology,2019 03 19,"Evaluation of minor salivary gland biopsy can be fraught with a wide range of problems, including technical limitations due to the small size and distorted nature of tissue received and interpretive difficulties navigating the considerable morphologic and immunohistochemical overlap between widely disparate entities.

This review will present the diagnostic considerations that arise from four histologic patterns that are frequently encountered on minor salivary gland biopsies: squamous differentiation, tubular and cribriform growth, mucin production, and myxoid stroma. The discussion herein will emphasize practical strategies and priorities for navigating these differential diagnoses in a clinically-relevant and cost-effective manner."

In this study, we evaluated the association between six dietary indices and mortality in the Golestan Cohort Study (GCS) in Iran, which is the largest prospective study in the Middle East with 50,045 participants. Methods The six dietary indices, namely the Healthy Eating Index (HEI-2015), Alternative Healthy Eating Index (AHEI-2010), Alternative Mediterranean Diet (AMED), Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension created by Fung (DASH-Fung) and Mellen (DASH-Mellen), and the World Cancer Research Fund (WCRF/AICR) index, were applied to data from a food frequency questionnaire, computed and divided into quintiles. Adjusted Cox models were used to estimate hazards ratio (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for overall and cause-specific mortality, using the lowest quintile as a reference group. Results Among 42,373 participants included in the current analyses, 4424 subjects died during 10.6 years of follow-up. Participants with the highest quintile dietary scores, compared with the lowest quintile dietary scores, had significantly decreased overall mortality in the AHEI-2010, AMED, DASH-Fung, and WCRF/AICR indices (HR 0.88, 95% CI = 0.80-0.97; 0.80, 0.70-0.91; 0.77, 0.70-0.86; and 0.79, 0.70-0.90, respectively). A reduced cardiovascular mortality was found for high AHEI-2010 and DASH-Fung scores (17% and 23%, respectively), and a reduced cancer mortality for high HEI-2015, AMED, and DASH-Fung scores (21, 37 and 25%, respectively). Conclusion Various indices of dietary quality are inversely associated with overall mortality, and selectively with cancer and cardiovascular mortality in the GCS, which contribute to the generalizability and validity of dietary guidelines.",A Local View of Informal Urban Environments: a Mobile Phone-Based Neighborhood Audit of Street-Level Factors in a Brazilian Informal Community.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30887375,Journal of urban health : bulletin of the New York Academy of Medicine,2019 03 19,"Street-level environment characteristics influence the health behaviors and safety of urban residents, and may particularly threaten health within informal communities. However, available data on how such characteristics vary within and among informal communities is limited. We sought to adapt street audit strategies designed to characterize the physical environment for use in a large informal community, Rio das Pedras (RdP) located in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. A smartphone-based systematic observation protocol was used to gather street-level information for a high-density convenience sample of street segments (N = 630, estimated as 86% of all street segments in the community). We adapted items related to physical disorder and physical deterioration. Measures selected to illustrate the approach include the presence of the following: (1) low-hanging or tangled wires, (2) litter, (3) structural evidence of sinking, and (4) an unpleasant odor. Intercept-only spatial generalized additive models (GAM) were used to evaluate and visualize spatial variation within the RdP community. We also examined how our estimates and conclusions about spatial variation might have been affected by lower-density sampling from random subsets street observations. Random subsets were selected to determine the robustness of study results in scenarios with sparser street sampling. Selected characteristics were estimated to be present for between 18% (unpleasant odor) to 59% (low-hanging or tangled wires) of the street segments in RdP; estimates remain similar (± 6%) when relying on a random subset created to simulate lower-density spatial sampling. Spatial patterns of variation based on predicted probabilities across RdP differed by indicator. Structural sinking and low-hanging or tangled wires demonstrated relatively consistent spatial distribution patterns across full and random subset sample sizes. Smartphone-based systematic observations represent an efficient and potentially feasible approach to systematically studying neighborhood environments within informal communities. Future deployment of such tools will benefit from incorporating data collection across multiple time points to explore reliability and quantify neighborhood change. These tools can prove useful means to assess street-level exposures that can be modifiable health determinants across a wide range of informal urban settings. Findings can contribute to improved urban planning and provide useful information for identifying potential locations for neighborhood-scaled interventions that can improve living conditions for residents in Rio das Pedras.",Prognostic Impact of Tumor Spread Through Air Spaces in Sublobar Resection for 1A Lung Adenocarcinoma Patients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30887374,Annals of surgical oncology,2019 05 11,This study aimed to clarify differences in the prognostic impact of tumor spread through air spaces (STAS) in lobectomy versus sublobar resection (SR).

In neurons and astrocytes, these ion channels are coupled to group I metabotropic glutamate receptors via Gαq-phospholipase C signal transduction. In the mouse cerebellar Purkinje neurons, TRPC channels assembled as tetramers of TRPC3 subunits exclusively mediate this glutamatergic signalling mechanism and regulation of alternative splicing results in dominance of a high Ca2+ conducting TRPC3c isoform. This regional control of TRPC3 transcript type likely has physiological and pathophysiological sequelae. The current study provides a quantitative comparison of the TRPC3c splice variant and the TRPC3b full-length isoform expression across seven regions of the human brain. This shows that the cerebellum has the highest expression level of both isoforms and that regulation of alternative splicing results in a higher propensity of the TRPC3c isoform in the cerebellum relative to the TRPC3b isoform (in a 1:3 ratio). This compares with the other regions (motor cortex, hippocampus, midbrain subregions, pons and medulla) where the prevalence of TRPC3c relative to TRPC3b is typically less than half as abundant. The finding here of a bias in the high-conductance TRPC3c isoform in the cerebellum is consistent with the enhanced vulnerability of the cerebellum to ischaemic injury.",A regularization approach for the detection of differential item functioning in generalized partial credit models.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30887369,Behavior research methods,2019 03 19,"Most common analysis tools for the detection of differential item functioning (DIF) in item response theory are restricted to the use of single covariates. If several variables have to be considered, the respective method is repeated independently for each variable. We propose a regularization approach based on the lasso principle for the detection of uniform DIF. It is applicable to a broad range of polytomous item response models with the generalized partial credit model as the most general case. A joint model is specified where the possible DIF effects for all items and all covariates are explicitly parameterized. The model is estimated using a penalized likelihood approach that automatically detects DIF effects and provides trait estimates that correct for the detected DIF effects from different covariates simultaneously. The approach is evaluated by means of several simulation studies.

Next, I test whether having a higher proportion of same-generation friends can protect immigrant youth from experiencing negative health outcomes and adopting risky behaviors. Results indicate that adolescents are more likely to form friendships with peers who share their immigrant generation status and that this tendency is particularly strong for first-generation immigrants. Furthermore, immigrant youth with greater proportions of same-generation friends are less likely to report several negative health behaviors and outcomes. My findings suggest that same-generation friendships can serve as a protective mechanism for immigrant youth, which may help explain the existence of an immigrant health paradox."

The hair essential trace elements and mineral levels were assessed using inductively coupled plasma mass-spectrometry. Overweight pregnant women had significantly reduced Cr (- 24%; p = 0.047) and Zn (- 13%; p = 0.008) content, as well as elevated hair Na and K levels as compared to the controls. Children from overweight and obese mothers had lower hair Mo (- 18%; p = 0.017), Se (- 8%; p = 0.043), and V (- 24%; p = 0.028) levels, as well as elevated Sr content (19%; p = 0.025). Correlation analysis revealed a significant relationship between maternal and child hair levels of Co (r = 0.170; p = 0.038), Cu (r = 0.513; p < 0.001), Mn (r = 0.240; p = 0.003), and Na (r = 0.181; p = 0.027) in the whole sample. Pre-pregnancy maternal body mass index (BMI) positively correlated with maternal hair K (r = 0.336; p < 0.001) and Na (r = 0.212; p = 0.008) and negatively correlated with V (r = - 0.204; p = 0.011) and Zn (r = - 0.162; p = 0.045) levels. The results indicate that impaired trace element and mineral metabolism may play a role in the link between maternal obesity, complications of pregnancy and child's postnatal development. Hypothetically, dietary improvement may be used as a tool to reduce these risks. However, further experimental and clinical studies are required to investigate the relationship between obesity and trace element metabolism in pregnancy.",The Effects of Fluoride on the Gap-Junctional Intercellular Communication of Rats' Osteoblast.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30887282,Biological trace element research,2019 03 19,"The gap junction protein plays an important role in the bone formation and alteration of these proteins leading to cause bone development. Aim to determine the effects of different concentration of fluoride on gap-junctional intercellular communication (GJIC) related genes and proteins in the rats' osteoblast cells. We treated the osteoblast cells with various concentrations (0, 0.01, 0.1, 0.5, and 1.0 mM) NaF for 24 and 72 h. We used the scrape loading and dye transfer technique to research the intracellular connectivity. Moreover, the mRNA expression levels of connexin 43 (Cx43), connexin45 (Cx45), collagen I, and osteocalcin (OCN) were analyzed by qRT-PCR, the protein expression levels of connexin43 (Cx43) were analyzed by western blotting and immunofluorescence. Our results suggested that the osteoblast proliferations were decreased in the 0.5 and 1 mM NaF groups, after 24 and 72 treatments. The scrape loading and dye transfer experiment showed that the GJIC were increased in the 0.01 mM NaF group and decreased in the 0.5 and 1 mM NaF groups. In addition, the mRNA expressions of Cx43, Cx45, and OCN, and the protein expressions of Cx43 were increased in the 0.01 mM NaF group and decreased in the 0.5 and 1 mM NaF groups. In summary, these results suggest that the low concentration NaF is good for the GJIC, but the high concentration NaF damages the GJIC."

Advances in selective breeding have accelerated the development of L. vannmei aquaculture. Recently, the genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been applied in aquaculture animals and markers associated with economic traits were identified. In this study, we focused on the growth trait of L. vannamei and performed GWAS to identify SNPs or genes associated with growth. Genomic regions in linkage group 7, 27, 33, and 38 were identified to be associated with body weight and body length of the shrimp. Further, candidate gene association analysis was performed in two independent populations and the result demonstrated that the SNPs in the genes protein kinase C delta type and ras-related protein Rap-2a were significantly associated with the growth trait of L. vannamei. This study showed that GWAS analysis is an efficient approach for screening trait-related markers or genes. The genomic regions and genes identified in this study are essential for further fine mapping of growth-related genes.

This study was designed using a survey administered to parents of children eligible for the HPV vaccine at community events throughout Central and Northern Michigan. These data suggest that the most important factor leading to successful vaccination is a conversation with a PCP. However, when the geographic location of these parents is considered, non-metropolitan parents were more concerned with the underlying safety and efficacy with the vaccine. This underscores the importance of tailoring a conversation with parents to meet their needs and concerns to lead to highest vaccination rates, and ultimately prevent HPV-related cervical cancers.",Stability and Bioavailability Enhancement of Telmisartan Ternary Solid Dispersions: the Synergistic Effect of Polymers and Drug-Polymer(s) Interactions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30887265,AAPS PharmSciTech,2019 05 22,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the synergistic effect of polymers and drug-polymer(s) interactions on the improved stability and bioavailability of telmisartan (TEL) ternary solid dispersions. As a water-insoluble drug, 40 and 160 mg doses of TEL tablets exhibited bioavailabilities of 42% and 58%, respectively. Through polymer screening, PVP K30 and/or Soluplus were selected and used at different concentrations to prepare TEL amorphous solid dispersions by solvent evaporation. Compared to pure TEL and TEL-PVP K30/Soluplus binary solid dispersions, TEL-PVP K30-Soluplus ternary solid dispersions demonstrated significant advantages, including higher dissolution (over 90% release at 60 min), better amorphous stability (physically stable in 90 days), and improved oral bioavailability (Cmax of 5535.819 ± 325.67 ng/mL and tmax of 1 h). These advantages were related to the complementarity of PVP K30 and Soluplus on TEL. PVP K30 had a better activity to solubilize TEL and achieved a high TEL initial concentration in dissolution media. Simultaneously, the ability of Soluplus to assist in the maintenance of supersaturation played an important role. PVP K30 and Soluplus together inhibited crystallization of the drug at different stages. The existence and intensity of drug-polymer interactions were also determined by DSC (Tg determination) and FT-IR. At the molecular level, a hypothesis was also proposed that the enhancements resulted from the contribution of the synergistic effect between PVP K30 and Soluplus. These results suggested that two polymers, in a combination and via a synergistic effect, could further enhance the bioavailability and amorphous stability of ternary solid dispersions.",Neuromodulation Approaches for Cardiac Arrhythmias: Recent Advances.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30887264,Current cardiology reports,2019 03 29,"This review aims to describe the latest advances in autonomic neuromodulation approaches to treating cardiac arrhythmias, with a focus on ventricular arrhythmias.",Comparison of electroretinographic measurements between tabletop and handheld stimulators in healthy subjects.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30887263,Documenta ophthalmologica.

In particular, it is assumed that parents play an important role in the development of children's self-esteem, also in adolescence. Despite the importance of parent-child attachment relationships for adolescents' self-esteem, we know very little about the extent to which fathers and mothers uniquely contribute to adolescents' self-esteem. The current study aims to contribute to acquiring knowledge in this research area in three ways. First, by separating the potential influences of father-child and mother-child attachment relationships on sons' and daughters' self-esteem, the current study is able to investigate the individual contribution of the father-child and mother-child attachment relationship to female and male adolescent's self-esteem. Second, by controlling for changes in the quality of the parental relationship and peer relationships the current study is able to isolate linkages between changes in adolescents' perceived quality of the parent-child attachment relationships and changes in adolescents' self-esteem. Third, by using longitudinal data and solely analyzing within-person variation, the current study is able to rule out stable confounding factors as alternative explanations. Self-reports of 542 adolescents (mean age at T1 = 13.6 years, percentage female = 0.51) from all three waves of the Dutch cohort study Social Development of Adolescents were used. The longitudinal fixed effects models showed that, for both sons and daughters, changes in the perceived quality of the mother-adolescent attachment relationship and changes in the perceived quality of the relationship between adolescents' parents were positively linked with changes in self-esteem. Changes in the perceived quality of the attachment relationship with father were only significantly linked to changes in daughters' self-esteem, not in that of sons. Contrary to the expectations, changes in peer relationships were not associated with changes in adolescents' self-esteem. These findings suggest that even though adolescents may be increasing their time spent with friends and romantic partners, perceived changes in the attachment relationships with fathers and mothers and in the wider family system are highly important for how adolescents think of and judge themselves.",Modulatory effects of Amukkara Choornam on Candida albicans biofilm: in vitro and in vivo study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30887260,Molecular biology reports,2019 06 10,"In the present study, Amukkara Chooram (AC) a well known herbal medicine was investigated for their antibiofilm efficacy against biofilm of Candida albicans. The biofilm inhibitory concentration of 20 µg/mL of AC showed promising effect by inhibiting the biofilm upto 60%. Morphogenic transition state of C. albicans from yeast cells to hyphal transition was prevented by AC was revealed from light microscopic images. In addition, the inhibition of yeast hyphae was examined in the induction medium supplemented with AC. Consequently, atomic force microscope (AFM) also documented the morphological changes observed during the transition state of C. albicans in the presence and absence of AC. Furthermore, scanning electron microscope (SEM) and confocal laser scanning microscopic (CLSM) images showed reduction in the biomass and thickness of the mature biofilm of C. albicans. In vivo investigation of C. albicans with zebrafish infection model presented the clearance of biofilm from the epithelium of the intestinal tissues. Later, the histological changes in liver and kidney due to C. albicans infection open up that treatment with AC was able to significantly rejuvenate the tissues. Altogether, the study presents AC as potent antibiofilm agent with potential ability as alternative medicine to treat C. albicans biofilm mediated infections."

Flow intermittency sensors offer a relatively new approach to characterize wet stream length dynamics at high spatial and temporal resolutions. We installed 51 flow intermittency sensors at an average spacing of 40 m along the stream network of a high-relief, headwater catchment (33 ha) in the Valley and Ridge of southwest Virginia. The sensors recorded the presence or absence of water every 15 min for 10 months. Calculations of the wet network proportion from sensor data aligned with those from field measurements, confirming the efficacy of flow intermittency sensors. The fine temporal scale of the sensor data showed hysteresis in wet stream length: the wet network proportion was up to 50% greater on the rising limb of storm events than on the falling limb for dry antecedent conditions, at times with a delay of several hours between the maximum wet proportion and peak runoff at the catchment outlet. Less stream length hysteresis was evident for larger storms with higher event and antecedent precipitation that resulted in peak runoff > 15 mm/day. To assess spatial controls on stream wetting and drying, we performed a correlation analysis between flow duration at the sensor locations and common topographic metrics used in stream network modeling. Topography did not fully explain spatial variation in flow duration along the stream network. However, entrenched valleys had longer periods of flow on the rising limbs of events than unconfined reaches. In addition, large upslope contributing areas corresponded to higher flow duration on falling limbs. Future applications that explore the magnitude and drivers of stream length variability may provide further insights into solute and runoff generation processes in headwater regions.",Circular HDAC9/microRNA-138/Sirtuin-1 Pathway Mediates Synaptic and Amyloid Precursor Protein Processing Deficits in Alzheimer's Disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30887246,Neuroscience bulletin,2019 03 19,"Synaptic dysfunction and abnormal processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP) are early pathological features in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recently, non-coding RNAs such as microRNAs (miRNAs) and circular RNAs (circRNAs) have been reported to contribute to the pathogenesis of AD. We found an age-dependent elevation of miR-138 in APP/PS1 (presenilin-1) mice. MiR-138 inhibited the expression of ADAM10 [a disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain-containing protein 10], promoted amyloid beta (Aβ) production, and induced synaptic and learning/memory deficits in APP/PS1 mice, while its suppression alleviated the AD-like phenotype in these mice. Overexpression of sirtuin 1 (Sirt1), a target of miR-138, ameliorated the miR-138-induced inhibition of ADAM10 and elevation of Aβ in vitro. The circRNA HDAC9 (circHDAC9) was predicted to contain a miR-138 binding site in several databases. Its expression was inversely correlated with miR-138 in both Aβ-oligomer-treated N2a cells and APP/PS1 mice, and it co-localized with miR-138 in the cytoplasm of N2a cells. CircHDAC9 acted as a miR-138 sponge, decreasing miR-138 expression, and reversing the Sirt1 suppression and excessive Aβ production induced by miR-138 in vitro. Moreover, circHDAC9 was decreased in the serum of both AD patients and individuals with mild cognitive impairment. These results suggest that the circHDAC9/miR-138/Sirt1 pathway mediates synaptic function and APP processing in AD, providing a potential therapeutic target for its treatment.",Effect of Apolipoprotein E Genotypes on Huntington's Disease Phenotypes in a Han Chinese Population.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30887245,Neuroscience bulletin,2019 03 19,"Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant degenerative disease that mainly encompasses movement, cognition, and behavioral symptoms. The apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene is thought to be associated with many neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we enrolled a cohort of 223 unrelated Han Chinese patients with HD and 1241 unrelated healthy controls in Southeastern China and analyzed the correlation between APOE genotypes and HD phenotypes. The results showed that the frequency of the E4 allele (7.1%) in HD patients was statistically less than that in controls (12.0%) (P =0.004). In addition, we divided patients into motor-onset and non-motor-onset groups, and analyzed the relationship with APOE genotypes. The results, however, were negative. Furthermore, the age at onset (AAO), defined as the age at the onset of motor symptoms, was compared in each APOE genotype subgroup and multivariate regression analysis was used to exclude the interference of CAG repeat length on AAO, but no association was found between APOE genotypes and AAO. Finally, we analyzed adult-onset HD to exclude the interference caused by juvenile HD (n = 13), and the results were negative. Therefore, our study suggests that APOE may not be a genetic modifier for HD, especially for adult-onset HD among Chinese of Han ethnicity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study of the correlation between APOE genotypes and HD phenotypes in a Han Chinese population.",Evaluation of the content coverage of questionnaires containing basic and instrumental activities of daily living (ADL) used in adult patients with brain tumors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30887244,Journal of neuro-oncology,2019 05 16,Everyday functioning can be assessed using measures of basic activities of daily living (BADL) or instrumental activities of daily living (IADL).

The changes in exposure of these substrates in subjects with rheumatoid arthritis (and hence elevated IL-6 levels) compared with healthy subjects were predicted with a reasonable degree of accuracy. The PBPK model was then used to simulate the change in oral exposure of the probe substrates in North European Caucasian, Chinese, and Japanese population of patients with neuromyelitis optica (NMO) or NMO spectrum disorder with elevated plasma IL-6 levels (up to 100 pg/mL). Moderate interactions [mean AUC fold change, ≤ 2.08 (midazolam) or 2.36 (simvastatin)] was predicted for CYP3A4 probe substrates and weak interactions (mean AUC fold change, ≤ 1.29-1.97) were predicted for CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6 substrates. No notable interaction was predicted with CYP1A2. Although ethnic differences led to differences in simulated exposure for some of the probe substrates, there were no marked differences in the predicted magnitude of the change in exposure following IL-6-mediated suppression of CYPs. Decreased levels of serum albumin (as reported in NMO patients) had little impact on the magnitude of the simulated IL-6-mediated drug interactions. This PBPK modeling approach allowed us to leverage knowledge from different disease and ethnic populations to make predictions of cytokine-related DDIs in a rare disease population where actual clinical studies would otherwise be difficult to conduct."

When municipal solid waste deposited in the landfills, microbial decomposition breaks down the wastes generating the end products, such as carbon dioxide, methane, volatile organic compounds, and liquid leachate. However, due to the landfill age, the fluctuation in the characteristics of landfill leachate is foreseen in the leachate treatment plant. The focuses of the researchers are keeping leachate from contaminating groundwater besides keeping potent methane emissions from reaching the atmosphere. To address the above issues, scientists are required to adopt green biological methods to keep the environment safe. This review focuses on the assorting of research papers on organic content and nitrogen removal from the leachate via recent effective biological technologies instead of conventional nitrification and denitrification process. The published researches on the characteristics of various Malaysian landfill sites were also discussed. The understanding of the mechanism behind the nitrification and denitrification process will help to select an optimized and effective biological treatment option in treating the leachate waste. Recently, widely studied technologies for the biological treatment process are aerobic methane oxidation coupled to denitrification (AME-D) and partial nitritation-anammox (PN/A) process, and both were discussed in this review article. This paper gives the idea of the modification of the conventional treatment technologies, such as combining the present processes to make the treatment process more effective. With the integration of biological process in the leachate treatment, the effluent discharge could be treated in shortcut and novel pathways, and it can lead to achieving ""3Rs"" of reduce, reuse, and recycle approach.",Contralateral prophylactic mastectomy in women with breast cancer without a family history or genetic predisposition : Consensus statement from the Austrian Gynecologic Oncology Working Group of the Austrian Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30887224,Wiener klinische Wochenschrift,2019 05 20,"The working group recommends against contralateral prophylactic mastectomy (CPM) in women with breast cancer without a family history or genetic predisposition with unilateral breast cancer.

This disease is associated with daytime sleepiness, increased motor vehicle accidents, heart failure and stroke. Treatment options include weight loss, positive airway pressure, pharyngeal and orthognatic surgery. However, selected patients have good response to oral appliances devices that intended to protrude and stabilize the mandible mechanically during the night in order to reduce the collapsibility of the upper airway. Selection of patients includes primary snoring, mild, moderate and positional apnea. The perfect mandibular advance device has not yet been designed. For these reasons, the objective of this paper is to present a new thermoadjustable chair-side oral appliance. Device integrates the best characteristics of custom made and boils and bite previous designs and minimizes inconveniences and possible side effects. The device is a titratable mandibular advancement appliance. It consists of two independent prefabricated trays adaptable to the shape of adult dental arch and linked to each other by a protrusion mechanism. Each tray contains a hard outer shell and a soft thermoplastic resin inner body. The position of the jaw can be adjusted by moving an aluminum rack into, or out from, the guide so the ratchet may get locked into a certain position ensuring the length of the mechanism. The protrusion mechanism is fixed to the splint using small rings that are articulated over a ""t"" button. Our prototype satisfies the requirements of an effective oral appliance, in terms of retention, comfort, safety and efficacy. It is easy to fit, durable, low cost, quickly titratable, not bulky and easy cleaning. Thermoplastic appliances are specially used like a predictor of treatment response in apnea patients. The device described is a cost-effective introduction to mandibular advancement technology. A qualified dentist or trained sleep doctor could mitigate dental side effects and reduce their incidence.",Imaging in Short Stature and Bone Age Estimation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30887222,Indian journal of pediatrics,2019 03 19,"Short stature in children is a diagnostic challenge to the physician.

However, the relationships of catecholamines with intelligence and their interactions with stress remain unclear. This study assessed stress, intelligence quotient (IQ), and catecholamine levels in 70 healthy subjects to elucidate associations between catecholamines and stress, and between catecholamines and IQ. Additionally, the associations of catecholamines with stress and IQ were analyzed according to hemispheric dominance using the Brain Preference Indicator (BPI). There were positive correlations between the NE/E ratio and the somatization of stress but negative correlations between the E/NE ratio and the somatization of stress among the total number of subjects. In the right-brain-dominant group, a high E/DA ratio was correlated with low levels of stress, somatization and depression, and high NE/E and DA/E ratios were associated with high levels of somatization. In the left-brain-dominant group, high E levels were correlated with low levels of depression. In the total subjects, there were positive correlations between the NE/E and DA/E ratios and the sum of the vocabulary, arithmetic, picture arrangement, and block design IQ subtests. Thus, these catecholamines were associated with stress and IQ, which suggests that the autonomic functional regulation of catecholamine levels in relation to stress may also affect cognitive functions related to intelligence in the brain. Furthermore, the relationships between catecholamines and stress or IQ differed depending on hemispheric dominance, which suggests that the present results could be used to inform the development of personalized therapies based on hemispheric asymmetry.",Comparative mitogenomic and phylogenetic analysis of Apalone spinifera and Apalone ferox (Testudines: Trionychidae).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30887216,Genetica,2019 05 20,"The soft-shell turtles Apalone spinifera (AS) and Apalone ferox (AF) are two important economic species. AF is found in the Yellow River of China, and is a confirmed member of the Trionychidae family. However, the classification of AS was in dispute. Mitochondrial genomes (mitogenomes) have been widely used for species identification, as well as population and phylogenetic analysis. In order to understand the phylogenetic and mitogenomic features of AS and AF, the complete mitogenomes were sequenced, annotated and analyzed in this study. The complete mitogenomes of AS and AF are 16,817 bp and 16,756 bp in length, respectively. Both mitogenomes contain 37 genes, seven short intergenic spacers and two long intergenic spacers. Comparative analysis showed that there are 1,137 variation sites (6.79%) between the two mitogenomes. AS and AF mitogenomes both show a usage preference in terms of nucleotides, codons and amino acids. In addition, the non-synonymous substitution rate/synonymous substitution rate indicates that all protein-coding genes (PCGs) have undergone a strong purifying selection. Phylogenetic trees constructed by 13 PCGs show a clear phylogenetic relationship of the soft-shell turtles and suggest that AS is a sister species to AF of the genus Apalone. The data could be useful for further research of species identification, population analysis and the mitogenomic features of soft-shell turtles.",Genetic structure of Kho population from north-western Pakistan based on mtDNA control region sequences.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30887215,Genetica,2019 05 20,"The Kho population speaking Khowar language reside since long ago in Chitral District of North-western Pakistan. So far, no report is available about their genetic structure and relationship with surrounding population groups. We partially sequenced the mitochondrial DNA control region from 16 unrelated Kho male and female individuals of different ages. The D-Loop region sequences of Kho were aligned and compared with the revised Cambridge Reference Sequence (rCRS). The genetic data of Kho was compared with surrounding north-western Pakistani population groups including Pathan, Kashmiri, and Hazara. Comparison with rCRS identified overall 49 different haplotypes for Kho samples. Among these 21 haplotypes were shared by more than one Kho individuals. The genetic diversity and power of discrimination observed for Kho group were 0.215 and 0.202 respectively indicating the Kho tribe as a least differentiated group among north-western Pakistani populations. The haplogroup mapping, phylogenetic and haplotype network analysis revealed the nearby maternal ancestral relationship between Kho and Kashmiri populations. The haplogroups analysis demonstrates the western Eurasian ancestral origin of Kho samples. However, the appearance of a few South Asian haplogroups with low frequency speculate the Kho tribe as an admixed population of western Eurasian and South Asian genetic components.",Inflammation and fibrosis in murine models of heart failure.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30887214,Basic research in cardiology,2019 04 15,"Heart failure is a consequence of various cardiovascular diseases and associated with poor prognosis. Despite progress in the treatment of heart failure in the past decades, prevalence and hospitalisation rates are still increasing. Heart failure is typically associated with cardiac remodelling. Here, inflammation and fibrosis are thought to play crucial roles. During cardiac inflammation, immune cells invade the cardiac tissue and modulate tissue-damaging responses. Cardiac fibrosis, however, is characterised by an increased amount and a disrupted composition of extracellular matrix proteins. As evidence exists that cardiac inflammation and fibrosis are potentially reversible in experimental and clinical set ups, they are interesting targets for innovative heart failure treatments. In this context, animal models are important as they mimic clinical conditions of heart failure patients. The advantages of mice in this respect are short generation times and genetic modifications. As numerous murine models of heart failure exist, the selection of a proper disease model for a distinct research question is demanding. To facilitate this selection, this review aims to provide an overview about the current understanding of the pathogenesis of cardiac inflammation and fibrosis in six frequently used murine models of heart failure. Hence, it compares the models of myocardial infarction with or without reperfusion, transverse aortic constriction, chronic subjection to angiotensin II or deoxycorticosterone acetate, and coxsackievirus B3-induced viral myocarditis in this context. It furthermore provides information about the clinical relevance and the limitations of each model, and, if applicable, about the recent advancements in their methodological proceedings."

It can be caused by filamentous bacteria or fungi and usually involves the legs and feet. Mycetoma is endemic in tropical and subtropical regions and is easily misdiagnosed in clinical practice because of its nonspecific clinical features and lack of awareness of the disease. Although mycetoma is very rare in mainland China, an increasing number of cases have been reported in recent years. Here, we report a case of mycetoma in a patient who was misdiagnosed many years before receiving the correct treatment, leading to disease progression and motion limitation. The grains that represent microorganismal colonies were important clues for diagnosis. We also reviewed reported cases of mycetoma in mainland China. The majority of cases were reported from southern regions. Actinomycetoma was more commonly reported than was eumycetoma. The causative agents of actinomycetoma included Nocardia brasiliensis, N. asteroides, N. otitidiscaviarum, N. ninae and Gordonia terrae, and the causative fungi of eumycetoma were identified as Madurella mycetomatis, Fonsecaea pedrosoi and Acremonium falciforme. Notably, the diagnosis of mycetoma was delayed from months to decades in all of the patients, likely due to a lack of clinical experience. Our literature review suggests the importance of increased awareness of mycetoma in clinical practice, especially in non-endemic regions. Further investigative studies are needed to determine the real incidence of the disease in China.",A general platform for efficient extracellular expression and purification of Fab from Escherichia coli.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30887174,Applied microbiology and biotechnology,2019 04 05,"Antigen-binding fragments (Fabs) are an important part of monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapeutics and can be cost-effectively produced using an Escherichia coli (E. coli) expression system. However, Fabs tend to form undesirable aggregates when expressed in the cytoplasm of E. coli, substantially reducing the yield of correctly folded proteins. To solve this problem, in this study, we used five Fab fragments targeting IGF1R, Her2, VEGF, RANKL, and PD-1 to develop a novel system employing the alkaline phosphatase (phoA) promoter and the heat-stable enterotoxin II (STII) leader sequence to facilitate the efficient expression and extracellular secretion of Fabs. Following phosphate starvation, all five Fab fragments were expressed in BL21(DE3), were largely secreted into the culture medium, and then, were further purified by affinity chromatography specific to the constant region of the light chain. The purified Fab products were evaluated and were found to have high purity, antigen-binding affinity, and in vitro bioactivity. The mechanism experiments revealed that (1) BL21(DE3) had significantly higher productivity than the K-12 strains investigated; (2) the secretion ability of the PhoA promoter was superior to that of the T7 promoter; and (3) signal peptide, STII, showed higher extracellular secretion efficiency than pelB. Our findings strongly suggested that the phoA-STII-facilitated extracellular production platform is highly promising for application in the manufacturing of Fab fragments for both academic and industrial purposes.","A simple biosynthetic pathway for 2,3-butanediol production in Thermococcus onnurineus NA1.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30887173,Applied microbiology and biotechnology,2019 04 05,"The biosynthetic pathway of 2,3-butanediol (2,3-BDO) production from pyruvate under anaerobic conditions includes three enzymes: acetolactate synthase (ALS), acetolactate decarboxylase (ALDC), and acetoin reductase (AR). Recently, in anaerobic hyperthermophilic Pyrococcus furiosus, it has been reported that acetoin, a precursor of 2,3-BDO, is produced from pyruvate by ALS through a temperature-dependent metabolic switch. In this study, we first attempted to produce 2,3-BDO from Thermococcus onnurineus NA1 using a simple biosynthetic pathway by two enzymes (ALS and AR) at a high temperature. Two heterologous genes, acetolactate synthase (alsS) from Pyrococcus sp. NA2 and alcohol dehydrogenase (adh) from T. guaymacensis, were introduced and expressed in T. onnurineus NA1. The mutant strain produced approximately 3.3 mM 2,3-BDO at 80 °C. An acetyl-CoA synthetase IIIα (TON_1001) was further deleted to enhance 2,3-BDO production, and the mutant strain showed a 25% increase in the specific production of 2,3-BDO. Furthermore, when carbon monoxide (CO) gas was added as a reductant, specific production of 2,3-BDO increased by 45%. These results suggest a new biosynthetic pathway for 2,3-BDO and demonstrate the possibility of T. onnurineus NA1 as a platform strain for 2,3-BDO production at high temperatures.",Bile-induced promoters for gene expression in Lactobacillus strains.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30887172,Applied microbiology and biotechnology,2019 04 13,"Bioengineering of probiotics allows the improvement of their beneficial characteristics. In this work, we develop a molecular tool that would allow the activation of desirable traits in probiotics once they reach the intestine.

The promoter P16090 from Lb. casei BL23 was selected and its bile induction confirmed in Lb. casei BL23, Lb. plantarum WCFS1, and in Lactobacillus rhamnosus and Lactobacillus reuteri strains. However, the induction did not occur in Lactococcus lactis MG1363 or Bifidobacterium strains.

However, introduction of the fluorescent probe often confers changed physicochemical properties, so that the fluorophore-CPP conjugate may exhibit cytotoxic effects and membrane damage not exerted by the native CPP. In the present study, introduction of fluorine probes was investigated as an alternative to fluorophore labeling of a CPP, since this only confers minor changes to its overall physicochemical properties. The high sensitivity of 19F NMR spectroscopy and the absence of background signals from naturally occurring fluorine enabled detection of internalized CPP. Also, degradation of fluorine-labeled peptides during exposure to Caco-2 cells could be followed by using 19F NMR spectroscopy. In total, five fluorinated analogues of the model CPP penetratin were synthesized by using commercially available fluorinated amino acids as labels, including one analogue also carrying an N-terminal fluorophore. The apparent cellular uptake was considerably higher for the fluorophore-penetratin conjugate indicating that the fluorophore moiety promoted uptake of the peptide. The use of 19F NMR spectroscopy enabled monitoring of the fate of the CPPs over time by establishing molar balances, and by verifying CPP integrity upon uptake. Thus, the NMR-based method offers several advantages over currently widespread methods relying on fluorescence detection. The present findings provide guidelines for improved labeling strategies for CPPs, thereby expanding the repertoire of analytical techniques available for studying degradation and uptake of CPPs."

Given that hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) often arises in the setting of underlying cirrhosis, expert input from hepatologists alongside hepatobiliary and transplant surgeons, radiation oncologists, interventional and body radiologists, and medical oncologists has become increasingly important in order to offer patients appropriate cancer treatments. The MDLTB structure has evolved since the early 2000s to bring these specialists together at regularly scheduled meetings to develop a therapeutic treatment plan for HCC management. MDLTBs have reduced the time to treatment and improved patient satisfaction. Standardized documentation with common data elements has been recommended to ensure adequate communication from MDLTB to referring healthcare providers. Retrospective studies consistently highlight the frequency of changes in treatment plans after MDLTB review to better adhere to guideline recommended care. Despite several decades of MDLTBs implementation, few studies describe clinical outcomes associated with MDLTBs such as patient survival and cost benefits. More research is needed in this area to further justify the heavy use of resources that are needed to maintain MDLTBs. Development and use of a centralized database to store such information may assist with future studies of clinical outcomes and inform quality improvement projects.","Systemic Management for Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma: A Review of the Molecular Pathways of Carcinogenesis, Current and Emerging Therapies, and Novel Treatment Strategies.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30887150,Digestive diseases and sciences,2019 04 08,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) arises from a number of cirrhosis-related and non-cirrhosis-related exposures and is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Achieving a durable cure currently relies on either resection or transplantation, but since most patients will be diagnosed with inoperable disease, there is great interest in achieving more effective systemic therapies. At a molecular level, HCC is heterogeneous, but initial treatment strategies, including the use of multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors and checkpoint inhibitors, have been fairly homogenous, depending on general host factors and overall tumor burden rather than specific molecular signatures. Over the past 2 decades, however, there has been significant success in identifying key molecular targets, including driver mutations involving the telomerase reverse transcriptase, p53, and beta-catenin genes, and significant work is now being devoted to translating these discoveries into the development of robust and well-tolerated targeted therapies.

There is growing interest in substituting currently utilized clinical treatments for vertebral compression fractures with an injectable, degradable, and bioactive system. In this research we studied the osteoinductive effect of calcium phosphate incorporation into cellulose nanocrystal/chitosan hydrogels with varying ratios of carbonate as an ionic crosslinker and genipin as a covalent crosslinker. As calcium and phosphate ions have been shown to be osteoinductive in time and concentration dependent manners, dibasic calcium phosphate was chosen as a bioactive additive due to its desirable controlled ion delivery potential. Gelation time, swelling ratio, erosion, compressive strength, and ion release behavior of different dibasic calcium phosphate incorporated hydrogels were evaluated. Mesenchymal stem cells were then exposed to mechanically competent hydrogels found capable of maintaining calcium and phosphate concentrations within the established bioactive range in order to assess their cytotoxicity and osteoinductivity. Our results demonstrate that hydrogels with higher covalent crosslinking possessed better mechanical properties and stabilities as well as more controlled calcium and phosphate ion release. Interestingly, dibasic calcium phosphate incorporation not only improved hydrogel bioactivity but also resulted in greater compressive strength.","Preparation, Characterization, and In vitro Evaluation of Curcumin- and Resveratrol-Loaded Solid Lipid Nanoparticles.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30887133,AAPS PharmSciTech,2019 05 22,"Curcumin and resveratrol are natural compounds with significant anticancer activity; however, their bioavailability is limited due to poor solubility.

The tyrosine kinase Btk is essentially required for the activation of NF-κB in BCR signaling through the canonical pathway of IKK-dependent phosphorylation and proteasomal degradation of IκB-α, the main repressor of NF-κB. Here, we provide the evidence of an additional mechanism of NF-κB activation in BCR signaling that is Btk-dependent and IKK-independent. In DeFew B lymphoma cells, the anti-IgM stimulation of BCR activated Btk and NF-κB p50/p65 within 0.5 min in absence of IKK activation and IκB-α degradation. IKK silencing did not affect the rapid activation of NF-κB. Within this short time, Btk associated and phosphorylated IκB-α at Y289 and Y305, and, concomitantly, p65 translocated from cytosol to nucleus. The mutant IκB-α Y289/305A inhibited the NF-κB activation after BCR triggering, suggesting that the phosphorylation of IκB-α at tyrosines 289 and 305 was required for NF-κB activation. In primary chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells, Btk was constitutively active and associated with IκB-α, which correlated with Y305-phosphorylation of IκB-α and increased NF-κB activity compared with healthy B cells. Altogether, these results describe a novel mechanism of NF-κB activation in BCR signaling that could be relevant for Btk-targeted therapy in B-lymphoproliferative disorders. KEY MESSAGES: Anti-IgM stimulation of BCR activates NF-κB p50/p65 within 30 s by a Btk-dependent and IKK-independent mechanism. Btk associates and phosphorylates IκB-α at Y289 and Y305, promoting NF-κB activation.

Aspen (Populus tremuloides) is a keystone species which co-exists with conifer species across temperate forests in North America. Aspen sucker regeneration which is the foundation of aspen-conifer forests succession is often a targeted food source by multiple ungulate species. Using a region-wide exclosure network across a broad gradient of aspen-conifer overstory abundance, we empirically tested the effects of ungulate herbivory and conifer competition (that increases with fire suppression), on the regeneration and recruitment of aspen forests over a 4-year period. The study results indicate that ungulate herbivory and increasing abundance of overstory conifers dramatically reduced aspen regeneration and recruitment success. The average height of aspen suckers exposed to ungulate herbivory was 72% shorter than aspen suckers in fenced plots and resulted in 24% less recruitment. There was a 9% decrease in aspen recruitment and 12% decrease in average aspen height with every 20% increase in overstory conifer density. Aspen suckers were most vulnerable to herbivory at 70 cm height, with the probability of herbivory decreasing under 50 cm or above 90 cm. Steep slope angles and higher winter precipitation increased aspen regeneration and recruitment success. Reduction in aspen recruitment in response to ungulate herbivory and competition by conifers may result in loss of biodiversity, altered forest function and loss of key ecosystem services because of the important role that aspen plays in facilitating forest succession and biodiversity.",Discrepancy between patient-reported quality of life and the prognostic assessment of Japanese patients hospitalized with acute heart failure.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30887105,Heart and vessels,2019 03 19,"Patient-reported quality of life (PRQL) is a primary therapeutic target for patients with chronic heart failure (HF) and is associated with long-term prognosis.

PRQL was evaluated using the KCCQ in consecutive 114 HHF patients. Its association with the composite outcome of all-cause mortality or HF readmission within the first year after discharge was analyzed. Furthermore, its distribution by the clinical risk score (GWTG-HF) was evaluated using Pearson's correlation coefficient. The median KCCQ was 34.9, but was widely distributed (interquartile range 23.7-56.8). After adjustment for known prognostic indicators, the KCCQ was not an independent predictor of the composite outcome within the first year (group with high vs. low KCCQ scores: hazard ratio, 0.67; 95% confidence interval 0.26-1.71). There was no significant correlation between the KCCQ and the GWTG-HF risk score. In conclusion, PRQL during the acute phase of HF was significantly impaired and also varied widely, irrespective of patient characteristics or severity.

This said, at the moment, there is no process for monoclonal antibodies (mAb) on the market, although especially polyethylene glycol-induced precipitation has shown great potential. One reason might be the highly complex behavior of each component of a crude feedstock during the precipitation process. For different investigated mAbs, significant variations in the host cell protein (HCP) reduction are observed. In contrast to the precipitation behavior of single components, the interactions and interplay in a complex feedstock are not fully understood yet. This work discusses the influence of contaminants on the precipitation behavior of two different mAbs, an IgG1, and an IgG2. By spiking the mAbs with mock solution, a complex feedstock could successfully be mimicked. Spiking contaminants influenced the yield and purity of the mAbs after the precipitation step, compared to the precipitation behavior of the single components. The mixture showed a decrease in the contaminant and mAb solubility. By re-buffering the mock solution prior to spiking, special salts, small molecules like amino acids, vitamins, or sugars could be depleted while larger ones like HCP or DNA were still present. Therefore, it was possible to distinguish the influence of small molecules and larger ones. Hence, mAb-macromolecular interaction could be identified as a possible reason for the observed higher precipitation propensity, while small molecules of the cell culture medium were identified as solubilisation factors during the precipitation process.",Enhancing the production of tacrolimus by engineering target genes identified in important primary and secondary metabolic pathways and feeding exogenous precursors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30887101,Bioprocess and biosystems engineering,2019 03 19,"Tacrolimus has been widely used as a powerful novel immunosuppressant. The objective of this study was to improve the production of tacrolimus by engineering the target genes of important primary and secondary metabolic pathways and feeding exogenous precursors. Based on the metabonomics analysis, the shikimic acid pathway is an important primary metabolic pathway for the producing tacrolimus. Combined overexpression of shikimate kinase and dehydroquinic acid synthetase genes led to a 33.1% enhancement of tacrolimus production compared to parent strain. To predict the most efficient targets in secondary metabolic pathways for improving the production of tacrolimus, a genome-scale dynamic metabolic network model was used. A knockout of the D-lactate dehydrogenase gene, combined with the overexpression of tryptophane synthase and aspartate 1-decarboxylase genes, led to a 29.8% enhancement of tacrolimus production compared to the parent strain. Finally, we investigated the impact of the genetic manipulations on transcription levels, cell growth, cell morphology and production of tacrolimus by qRT-PCR and scanning electron microscopy to reveal the relationship between the growth of strains, the effects of engineering and fermentation. As the efficient synthesis of tacrolimus requires a rich supply of external substrates, the efficiency of the metabolic pathways that convert these substances is extremely important. The combined addition of three external substrates such as shikimic acid, alanine and the n-dodecane increased tacrolimus production by 49.5%. The insights obtained in this study will help further elucidate the mechanisms by which the identified target genes promote the activity of important primary and secondary metabolic pathways for tacrolimus biosynthesis and provide a new feeding strategy to improve tacrolimus production."

Therefore, new approaches of prevention must be found.General practitioner, ambulant care, hospital, and nursing home settings were investigated in a project funded by the German ministry of health. Workshops were conducted and the results are presented here.Sufficient knowledge and continuous care are available in hospitals and nursing homes. The basic challenge for general practitioners and ambulatory caregivers is to provide appropriate care for older persons living alone and in need of help. Proactive care during extremely hot days cannot be provided due to staff shortages. Experience from other countries indicates that a new course of action must be found. The main tasks of general practitioners should be the identification and consultation of persons at risk. Experience from previous years have demonstrated that formal structures of nursing and medical care alone failed to prevent the recurrence of a catastrophe caused by a heatwave and that human loss is substantial.A possible approach could be volunteer-based disaster protection, which is well-developed in Germany. After proclamation of a major (heat) disaster in the community, close cooperation with general practitioners would be essential.

This involves optimizing phylogenetic tree, model and data in an exercise of reciprocal illumination. Rooted ToLs have been built from a census of protein structural domains in proteomes using two kinds of models. Fully-reversible models use standard-ordered (additive) characters and Wagner parsimony to generate unrooted trees of proteomes that are then rooted with Weston's generality criterion. Non-reversible models directly build rooted trees with unordered characters and asymmetric stepmatrices of transformation costs that penalize gain over loss of domains. Here, we test the empirical support for the evolutionary models with character state reconstruction methods using two published proteomic datasets. We show that the reversible models match reconstructed frequencies of character change and are faithful to the distribution of serial homologies in trees. In contrast, the non-reversible models go counter to trends in the data they must explain, attracting organisms with large proteomes to the base of the rooted trees while violating the triangle inequality of distances. This can lead to serious reconstruction inconsistencies that show model inadequacy.

Half of the participants performed the ADL in a natural speed, the other half as fast as possible. The performance in the Trail Making Task B revealed an increased slope after 67 years of age. When executed in a natural speed, ADL kinematics were comparable. When executed as fast as possible, almost all kinematic parameters showed significant group and speed differences and revealed group × speed interactions. Models of multiple linear regression predicting ADL trial durations showed similar strategies in the young and older adults < 67a. Factors were the general movement speed, the travelled path lengths, and the simultaneous use of both hands. In the older adults ≥ 67a, factors were the general movement speed, the travelled path length, and the activity level (during the task execution). A principal component analysis supported these findings by revealing two underlying components: movement strategy and age-dependent decline in primarily executive functions, where the ADL trial duration had comparable loadings on both components. These results in association with the accelerated decline in executive functions found in the oldest group suggest that deterioration of ADL with age is particularly caused by specific age-dependent changes in cognitive capacities."

Multivariate Cox regression model was used to analyze the risk factors for mortality, reintervention and endocarditis. Freedom from reintervention and endocarditis were plotted using the Kaplan-Meier curve. Hospital mortality was 7.8%, and the late mortality was 3.1%. Patient survival at 1, 5 and 10 years was 92.2%, 87.1% and 84.3%, respectively. Freedom from reintervention at 1 and 5 years was 94.1% and 60.9%.

Freedom from endocarditis at 1, 5 and 10 years was 99.1%, 93.0% and 58.0%, respectively. Diffuse stenosis of the conduit (p = 0.003) was an independent risk factor for late endocarditis. Both bovine jugular venous conduits and bovine pericardial prosthetic conduits are associated with acceptable outcomes. Reintervention remains high in patients who have smaller size conduit and undergo previous palliation.

Despite surgical and pharmacological efforts to preserve residual hearing, a significant number of these patients suffer a late, unexplained loss of residual hearing. Surgical trauma can be excluded as the cause. To investigate this phenomenon and because cells in their native environment react differently to stimuli (such as electrical current) than isolated cells, whole-organ explants from cochleae may be a better model. For early detection of synaptic changes in the organ of Corti, a high-resolution microscopic technique such as stimulated emission depletion (StED) can be used. The aim of this study was establishment of a qualitative and quantitative technique to determinate changes in the organ of Corti and its synapses after electrical stimulation. Explanted organs of Corti from postnatal rats (P2-4) were cultured on a coverslip for 24 h and subsequently exposed to biphasic pulsed electrical stimulation (amplitude 0.44-2.0 mA, pulse width 400 μs, interpulse delay 120 μs, repetition 1 kHz) for another 24 h. For visualization, the cytoskeleton and the ribbon synapses were stained immunocytochemically. For an early detectable response to electrical stimulation, the number of synapses was quantified. Organs of Corti without electrical stimulation served as a reference. Initial research has shown that electrical stimulation can cause changes in ribbon synapses and that StED can detect these alterations. The herein established model could be of great importance for identification of molecular changes in the organ of Corti in response to electrical or other stimuli.",Quantifying the impact of reducing socioeconomic inequalities in modifiable risk factors on mortality and mortality inequalities in South Korea.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30887061,International journal of public health,2019 05 16,We quantified the impact of reducing socioeconomic inequalities in risk factors on mortality and mortality inequalities in South Korea.,Tobacco smoking and dopaminergic function in humans: a meta-analysis of molecular imaging studies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30887059,Psychopharmacology,2019 03 19,"About 1.1 billion people smoke tobacco globally and tobacco-related health care costs 1.8% of GDP in many countries.

It has been difficult to disentangle the direct effects of Parkinson's disease from compensatory changes that reconfigure the functional signature of the whole brain network. To examine the causal role of dopamine depletion in network-level topology, we investigated time-varying network structure in 37 individuals with idiopathic Parkinson's disease, both ON and OFF dopamine replacement therapy, along with 50 age-matched, healthy control subjects using resting state functional MRI. By tracking dynamic network-level topology, we found that the Parkinson's disease OFF state was associated with greater network-level integration than in the ON state. The extent of integration in the OFF state inversely correlated with motor symptom severity, suggesting that a shift toward a more integrated network topology may be a compensatory mechanism associated with preserved motor function in the dopamine depleted OFF state. Furthermore, we were able to demonstrate that measures of both cognitive and brain reserve (i.e. premorbid intelligence and whole brain grey matter volume) had a positive relationship with the relative increase in network integration observed in the dopaminergic OFF state. This suggests that each of these factors plays an important role in promoting network integration in the dopaminergic OFF state. Our findings provide a mechanistic basis for understanding the Parkinson's disease OFF state and provide a further conceptual link with network-level reconfiguration. Together, our results highlight the mechanisms responsible for pathological and compensatory change in Parkinson's disease.",Cryptic lineages and a population dammed to incipient extinction? Insights into the genetic structure of a Mekong River catfish.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30887034,The Journal of heredity,2019 03 19,"An understanding of the genetic composition of populations across management boundaries is vital to developing successful strategies for sustaining biodiversity and food resources. This is especially important in ecosystems where habitat fragmentation has altered baseline patterns of gene flow, dividing natural populations into smaller sub-populations and increasing potential loss of genetic variation through genetic drift. River systems can be highly fragmented by dams built for flow regulation and hydropower. We used reduced-representation sequencing to examine genomic patterns in an exploited catfish, Hemibagrus spilopterus, in a hotspot of biodiversity and hydropower development- the Mekong River basin. Our results revealed the presence of two highly-divergent coexisting genetic lineages which may be cryptic species. Within the lineage with the greatest sample sizes, pairwise FST values, principal components analysis, and a STRUCTURE analysis all suggest that long-distance migration is not common across the Lower Mekong Basin, even in areas where flood-pulse hydrology has limited genetic divergence. In tributaries, effective population size estimates were at least an order of magnitude lower than in the Mekong mainstream indicating these populations may be more vulnerable to perturbations such as human-induced fragmentation. Fish isolated upstream of several dams in one tributary exhibited particularly low genetic diversity, high amounts of relatedness, and a level of inbreeding (GIS = 0.51) that has been associated with inbreeding depression in other outcrossing species. Our results highlight the importance of assessing genetic structure and diversity in riverine fisheries populations across proposed dam development sites for the preservation of these critically-important resources.","The Costs of Drugs in Infectious Diseases: Branded, Generics, and Why We Should Care.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30887033,The Journal of infectious diseases,2019 03 19,"While health care providers have largely turned a blind eye, the cost of health care in the US has been skyrocketing, in part as a result of rising drug prices. Patent protections and market exclusivity, while serving to incentivize targeted new drug development, have exacerbated inequitable outcomes and reduced access, sometimes fueling national epidemics. Branded drug manufacturers face few barriers to exorbitant pricing of drugs with exclusivity-as in the cases of Sovaldi, Zyvox, and Truvada. Furthermore, albendazole, pyrimethamine, and penicillin demonstrate that generic medications without patent exclusivity are not guaranteed to have durably low costs, especially where manufacturer competition is lacking. There is a way forward: through education and awareness, cost-conscious guideline development, government regulation, and market-level incentives, health care providers can collaborate to contain drug prices, curbing expenditures overall while expanding health care access to patients.",Evaluating a real world ban on menthol cigarettes: an interrupted time series analysis of sales.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30887032,Nicotine & tobacco research : official journal of the Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco,2019 03 19,"Menthol in cigarettes has been shown to increase regular cigarette smoking and nicotine dependence, and decrease success in smoking cessation.

Here, we identify Tfr2 as a regulator of bone homeostasis that inhibits bone formation. Mice lacking Tfr2 display increased bone mass and mineralization independent of iron homeostasis and hepatic Tfr2. Bone marrow transplantation experiments and studies of cell-specific Tfr2 knockout mice demonstrate that Tfr2 impairs BMP-p38MAPK signaling and decreases expression of the Wnt inhibitor sclerostin specifically in osteoblasts. Reactivation of MAPK or overexpression of sclerostin rescues skeletal abnormalities in Tfr2 knockout mice. We further show that the extracellular domain of Tfr2 binds BMPs and inhibits BMP-2-induced heterotopic ossification by acting as a decoy receptor. These data indicate that Tfr2 limits bone formation by modulating BMP signaling, possibly through direct interaction with BMP either as a receptor or as a co-receptor in a complex with other BMP receptors. Finally, the Tfr2 extracellular domain may be effective in the treatment of conditions associated with pathological bone formation.",Relapse rates after elective discontinuation of anti-TNF therapy in rheumatoid arthritis: a meta-analysis and review of literature.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30886998,BMC rheumatology,2019 03 29,Inhibitors of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) are current mainstay of therapies for rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

Disadvantaged mothers may experience benefit from supplements to family income, such as the earned income tax credit (EITC). We examined the effects of state-level EITCs on birth outcomes among women with a high school education or less, stratified by race and ethnicity. Methods: A quasi-experimental multistate and multiyear difference-in-differences design is used to assess effects of the presence and generosity of 23 state-level EITC laws on birth outcomes from 1994 to 2013. The methods utilized the U.S. National Vital Statistics System birth data for the outcomes: birth weight, probability of low birth weight (LBW; <2500 g), and gestation weeks. Results: Across all subgroups, any level of state EITC is associated with better birth outcomes with the largest effects seen among states with more generous EITCs. Black mothers experience larger percentage point reductions in the probability of LBW and increases in gestation duration. Among mothers with a high school education or less, results translate into 3760 fewer LBW babies with black mothers and 8364 fewer LBW babies with white mothers per year at the most generous state EITC level (i.e., 10% or more of federal and refundable). Hispanic and non-Hispanic mothers display relatively similar effects. Conclusions: The EITC at the federal and state level is an effective policy tool to reduce poverty and improve birth outcomes across racial and ethnic subgroups. Given the historically higher risk among black mothers, state-level EITC expansions offer one policy option to address this persistent health disparity.",Short-term meditation modulates EEG activity in subjects with post-traumatic residual disabilities.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30886941,Clinical neurophysiology practice,2019 03 29,"Neurophysiological changes related to meditation have recently attracted scientific attention.

Physical activity and healthy food are vital for chronic disease prevention yet challenging to access in economically distressed areas. Public health prevention efforts have become particularly prominent within faith-based organizations over the last three decades. This manuscript describes the protocol of the Church Challenge, a multilevel cluster-randomized controlled nutrition and physical activity trial across 24 churches to reduce blood pressure by 6 mmHg among 576 residents in Flint, MI. The Church Challenge was developed using community-based participatory approaches and is rooted in a church-based program developed by and for primarily African-American Flint church congregations. This three-level intervention addresses health at the community (level 3), church (level 2), and individual (level 1) to reduce blood pressure, reduce chronic disease risk, and promote health equity and wellbeing in Flint. Churches are randomized in a 1:1 ratio to a 16-week physical activity and nutrition program or a 4-session health and wellness workshop. Flint is not a unique community but has a history of traumatic community wide events; even now, the public health infrastructure continues to be a challenge and distract residents from focusing on their health. This trial is highly significant and innovative because it uses a combination of evidence-based practices simultaneously supporting health behavior change for individuals and their faith organizations, and evaluates multilevel efforts to sustain long-term health promotion activities in vulnerable communities like Flint.",Prevalence and mechanism of fluoroquinolone resistance in clinical isolates of Proteus mirabilis in Japan.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30886932,Heliyon,2019 04 24,"Fluoroquinolone (FQ) and cephalosporin (CEP) resistance among Enterobacteriaceae has been increasingly reported. FQ resistance occurs primarily through mutations in DNA gyrase (gyrA and gyrB) and topoisomerase IV (parC and parE). CEP resistance in Enterobacteriaceae is mainly due to the production of CTX-M type extended-spectrum β-lactamases. Although prevalence and mechanisms of FQ and CEP resistance in Enterobacteriaceae such as Escherichia coli have been well studied, little is known about Proteus mirabilis in Japan. In this study, we assessed the prevalence and mechanism of FQ resistance in Japanese clinical isolates of P. mirabilis. We collected 5845 P. mirabilis isolates from eight hospitals between 2000 and 2013. Prevalence of FQ resistance was calculated as the annual average percentage of all P. mirabilis isolates. We selected 50 isolates exhibiting susceptibility, intermediate resistance, or resistance to levofloxacin (LVX) and identified amino acid substitutions in GyrA, GyrB, ParC, and ParE. The prevalence of FQ-resistant P. mirabilis gradually increased from 2001 to 2004, reaching 16.6% in 2005, and has remained relatively high (13.3-17.5%) since then. Low-level LVX-resistant strains (MIC, 8-16 mg/L) showed significant changes in GyrB (S464Y or -I, or E466D). High-level LVX-resistant strains (MIC, 32-128 mg/L) displayed significant changes in GyrA (E87K) and ParE (D420N).

In this study, predictive analysis was carried out to determine the extent to which the fifth year and final Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) of engineering students in a Nigerian University can be determined using the program of study, the year of entry and the Grade Point Average (GPA) for the first three years of study as inputs into a Konstanz Information Miner (KNIME) based data mining model. Six data mining algorithms were considered, and a maximum accuracy of 89.15% was achieved. The result was verified using both linear and pure quadratic regression models, and R2 values of 0.955 and 0.957 were recorded for both cases. This creates an opportunity for identifying students that may graduate with poor results or may not graduate at all, so that early intervention may be deployed.","A new approach for processing climate missing databases applied to daily rainfall data in Soummam watershed, Algeria.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30886916,Heliyon,2019 03 29,"Missing data is a very frequent problem in climatology, it influences on the quality of results that will afford in hydrological studies, as well as water resources management. This paper proposes a new imputation algorithm, based on the optimization of some regression methods, which are hot deck, k-nearest-neighbors imputation, weighted k-nearest-neighbors imputation, multiple imputation, linear regression and simple average method. The choice of these methods was justified by qualitative and quantitative statistical tests analysis. However, the reliability of obtained results depends mainly on percentage of missing data, choice of neighboring stations and data missingness mechanism which should be missing at random. During the study it was found that the most of stations in Soummam watershed don't have a good correlation because the large loss in rainfall data or the geology of watershed which gives a relationship between station position and rainfall variability. For this case, principal component analysis is applied on a set of stations; it showed a positive impact of altitude, latitude and longitude on correlation index between selected stations. The graphical analysis of the normal law on RMSE values, which were obtained by applying the proposed technique in several random cases of missingness, that are 4%, 8%, 12% and 16% respectively, it confirmed the validity and the performance of this approach.","Serological study on toxoplasmosis in the Haliti-Paresí community of the Utiariti indigenous territory, Campo Novo do Parecis, Mato Grosso, Brazil.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30886914,Parasite epidemiology and control,2019 03 29,"Toxoplasma gondii is the etiological agent of toxoplasmosis, a widespread zoonosis that affects several homeothermic animals, including humans. This disease causes serious health problems, such that 10% of infected individuals develop clinical manifestations. Some studies on indigenous human populations have indicated variations in seroprevalence from 10.6% to 80.4% in such populations in different regions of Brazil and in other countries like Venezuela and Malaysia. To date, there have been no studies regarding the prevalence of anti-T. gondii antibodies in Haliti-Paresí Indians living in Campo Novo do Parecis, Mato Grosso, Brazil. Our objective here was to determine the frequency of occurrence of antibodies against this protozoon in nine Haliti-Paresí villages by correlating seroprevalence with locations and variables. Serodiagnoses were made using the indirect immunofluorescence antibody test (IFAT) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in the Laboratory for Toxoplasmosis and Other Protozoan Diseases of IOC/Fiocruz. It was considered that samples tested positive for T. gondii infection if IgG/IgM antibodies against this protozoon were detected through serodiagnosis using either IFAT or ELISA. Among the 293 samples analyzed, 66.9% presented anti-T. gondii IgG and 3.4% presented anti-T. gondii IgM. It was observed that there were no statistically significant differences in frequency of antibody occurrence among infected individuals, based on sex, schooling or occupation/activities. However, there were statistical differences based on age and villages. The prevalence observed in this study is in agreement with values found in other studies on indigenous populations in Latin America. Like among other such populations, the Haliti-Paresí villages are located close to forests and the individuals have domestic cats as pets, are involved in hunting and farming and consume water directly from water accumulation sources. These factors might cause exposure to T. gondii tissue cysts and oocysts.",Treating the Chameleon: Radiotherapy in the management of Renal Cell Cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30886912,Clinical and translational radiation oncology,2019 05 02,To review the role of radiotherapy (RT) in the treatment of renal cell cancer (RCC) in the curative and palliative setting.,Neural oscillations in the primate caudate nucleus correlate with different preparatory states for temporal production.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30886911,Communications biology,2019 03 29,"When measuring time, neuronal activity in the cortico-basal ganglia pathways has been shown to be temporally scaled according to the interval, suggesting that signal transmission within the pathways is flexibly controlled. Here we show that, in the caudate nuclei of monkeys performing a time production task with three different intervals, the magnitude of visually-evoked potentials at the beginning of an interval differed depending on the conditions. Prior to this response, the power of low frequency components (6-20 Hz) significantly changed, showing inverse correlation with the visual response gain. Although these components later exhibited time-dependent modification during self-timed period, the changes in spectral power for interval conditions qualitatively and quantitatively differed from those associated with the reward amount. These results suggest that alteration of network state in the cortico-basal ganglia pathways indexed by the low frequency oscillations may be crucial for the regulation of signal transmission and subsequent timing behavior.",The neural basis of meta-volition.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30886910,Communications biology,2019 03 29,"Volition is the power to act beyond simple, automatic responses. We can act voluntarily because we can choose to act otherwise than immediate, external circumstances dictate. But we can also choose to allow ourselves to be led automatically by events around us. The neural basis of this higher power to suspend volition- which we term meta-volition-is unknown. Here we show that inter-individual differences in meta-volition are reflected in extensive, highly lateralised differences in right frontal white matter as indexed by diffusion tensor imaging. Paradoxically, participants with enhanced white matter optimality in these regions are less able to exercise meta-volition, finding it harder to suspend volition. This suggests volition is dependent less on any hierarchical system of meta-volitional control than on the extent to which an extensive network subserving higher volitional powers is competitively dominant over others. A fundamentally parallel neural organisation of human voluntary action at the highest level is thereby implied.",Genetic and epigenetic architecture of paternal origin contribute to gestation length in cattle.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30886909,Communications biology,2019 03 29,"The length of gestation can affect offspring health and performance. Both maternal and fetal effects contribute to gestation length; however, paternal contributions to gestation length remain elusive. Using genome-wide association study (GWAS) in 27,214 Holstein bulls with millions of gestation records, here we identify nine paternal genomic loci associated with cattle gestation length. We demonstrate that these GWAS signals are enriched in pathways relevant to embryonic development, and in differentially methylated regions between sperm samples with long and short gestation length. We reveal that gestation length shares genetic and epigenetic architecture in sperm with calving ability, body depth, and conception rate. While several candidate genes are detected in our fine-mapping analysis, we provide evidence indicating ZNF613 as a promising candidate for cattle gestation length. Collectively, our findings support that the paternal genome and epigenome can impact gestation length potentially through regulation of the embryonic development.",Tasmanian devils with contagious cancer exhibit a constricted T-cell repertoire diversity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30886908,Communications biology,2019 03 29,"The Tasmanian devil (Sarcophilus harrisii) is threatened by a contagious cancer, known as Devil Facial Tumour Disease (DFTD). A highly diverse T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoire is crucial for successful host defence against cancers. By investigating TCR beta chain diversity in devils of different ages, we show that the T-cell repertoire in devils constricts in their second year of life, which may explain the higher DFTD prevalence in older devils. Unexpectedly, we also observed a pronounced decline in TCR diversity and T cell clonal expansion in devils after DFTD infection. These findings overturned the previous assumption that DFTD did not directly impact host immunity."

On the positive side of the future of the autopsy, we discuss the tremendous opportunities for important research to be done by application of advanced molecular biological techniques to formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue blocks obtained at autopsy. We also note with concern the countervailing forces impacting the influence of pathology in education and clinical practice at our academic medical centers, which also present impediments to increasing autopsy rates. Our challenge as academic pathologists, whose careers have been molded by involvement in the autopsy, is to counter these trends.

To date, few formal research studies have examined the prevalence of this practice or the reasoning patients' request that their specimens to be returned to them. This study interviews patients from 2015 to 2017 at one US academic medical center who requested their surgical pathology specimens. Of the 22 eligible patients, 8 patients agreed to be interviewed. Interviews lasted 10 to 30 minutes and included 5 questions. The questions were: (1) What motivated your decision to obtain your surgical pathology specimen, (2) What, if anything, did you do with your specimen, (3) What were positive aspects of your experience, (4) What were negative aspects of your experience, (5) What can the pathology department change to better support patients who request their surgical pathology specimens? Verbatim transcripts were generated and a mixed-methods analysis was performed. The type of specimens included products of conception, placenta and cord, costal cartilage and ribs, loop explant recorder, pacemaker, below knee amputation, and cervix, uterus, Fallopian tubes, and ovaries. The dominant themes included adversity, medical interest, souvenir, cultural beliefs, and curiosity. Subthemes included becoming whole in the afterlife, preservation, my body, restoration, honoring, and regret. In conclusion, pathologists can expand their role as patient advocates and advance patient-centered pathology by supporting patient's individual needs, motivations, and goals, when they request their surgical pathology specimens.",Hip load capacity cut-points for Astronaut Skeletal Health NASA Finite Element Strength Task Group Recommendations.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30886891,NPJ microgravity,2019 03 29,"Concerns raised at a 2010 Bone Summit held for National Aeronautics and Space Administration Johnson Space Center led experts in finite element (FE) modeling for hip fracture prediction to propose including hip load capacity in the standards for astronaut skeletal health. The current standards for bone are based upon areal bone mineral density (aBMD) measurements by dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and an adaptation of aBMD cut-points for fragility fractures. Task Group members recommended (i) a minimum permissible outcome limit (POL) for post-mission hip bone load capacity, (ii) use of FE hip load capacity to further screen applicants to astronaut corps, (iii) a minimum pre-flight standard for a second long-duration mission, and (iv) a method for assessing which post-mission physical activities might increase an astronaut's risk for fracture after return. QCT-FE models of eight astronaut were analyzed using nonlinear single-limb stance (NLS) and posterolateral fall (NLF) loading configurations. QCT data from the Age Gene/Environment Susceptibility (AGES) Reykjavik cohort and the Rochester Epidemiology Project were analyzed using identical modeling procedures. The 75th percentile of NLS hip load capacity for fractured elderly males of the AGES cohort (9537N) was selected as a post-mission POL. The NLF model, in combination with a Probabilistic Risk Assessment tool, was used to assess the likelihood of exceeding the hip load capacity during post-flight activities. There was no recommendation to replace the current DXA-based standards. However, FE estimation of hip load capacity appeared more meaningful for younger, physically active astronauts and was recommended to supplement aBMD cut-points.",Sign Tracking and Goal Tracking Are Characterized by Distinct Patterns of Nucleus Accumbens Activity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30886890,eNeuro,2019 06 10,"During Pavlovian conditioning, if a cue (e.g., lever extension) predicts reward delivery in a different location (e.g., a food magazine), some individuals will come to approach and interact with the cue, a behavior known as sign tracking (ST), and others will approach the site of reward, a behavior known as goal tracking (GT). In rats, the acquisition of ST versus GT behavior is associated with distinct profiles of dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), but it is unknown whether it is associated with different patterns of accumbens neural activity. Therefore, we recorded from individual neurons in the NAc core during the acquisition, maintenance, and extinction of ST and GT behavior. Even though NAc dopamine is specifically important for the acquisition and expression of ST, we found that cue-evoked excitatory responses encode the vigor of both ST and GT behavior. In contrast, among sign trackers only, there was a prominent decrease in reward-related activity over the course of training, which may reflect the decreasing reward prediction error encoded by phasic dopamine. Finally, both behavior and cue-evoked activity were relatively resistant to extinction in sign trackers, as compared with goal trackers, although a subset of neurons in both groups retained their cue-evoked responses. Overall, the results point to the convergence of multiple forms of reward learning in the NAc.",Incorporation of Sensitive Ester and Chloropurine Groups into Oligodeoxynucleotides through Solid Phase Synthesis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30886889,ChemistrySelect,2019 03 29,"Nucleosides containing ester groups that are sensitive to nucleophiles were incorporated into oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) through solid phase chemical synthesis. The sensitive esters are located on a purine nucleobase. They are the esters of ethyl, 2-methoxyethyl, 4-methoxyphenyl and phenyl groups, and a thioester. These esters cannot survive the deprotection and cleavage conditions used in known ODN synthesis technologies, which involve strong nucleophiles such as ammonium hydroxide and potassium methoxide (potassium carbonate in anhydrous methanol). To incorporate these sensitive groups into ODNs, the Dmoc phosphoramidites and linker were used for solid phase synthesis, which allowed ODN deprotection and cleavage to be carried out under non-nucleophilic oxidative conditions. Sixteen ODN sequences containing these groups were synthesized and characterized with MALDI MS. In addition, the synthesis and characterization of three ODNs containing a nucleophile sensitive 6-chloropurine using the same strategy are described.",Executive Control and Adolescent Health: Toward A Conceptual Framework.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30886888,Adolescent research review,2019 03 29,"Executive control is a set of cognitive abilities that may impact a variety of adolescent health behaviors and outcomes; however, research on executive control as a contributor to the physical health of youth is relatively limited. Therefore, the current article explores the possible role of executive control in adolescent health by reviewing relevant literature and proposing a conceptual framework to guide future research in this area. The development of executive control from preschool through adolescence is described, with particular attention to executive control in the unique health context of adolescence. A new conceptual model is proposed, focusing on how executive control may play a critical role in supporting health in adolescence and beyond through the mechanisms of attentional, behavioral, and emotional control. Literature exploring associations between youth executive control and key health behaviors (including diet, physical activity, sleep and substance use) is reviewed. Researchers and clinicians are encouraged to consider executive control as an important cross-cutting contributor to health during adolescence and beyond and to incorporate this construct into longitudinal studies of health.","State inequality, socioeconomic position and subjective cognitive decline in the United States.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30886886,SSM - population health,2019 03 29,"Social gradients in health have been observed for many health conditions and are suggested to operate through the effects of status anxiety.

Variants in SQSTM1 are found in up to 40% of patients with a family history of the disease, where a pattern of autosomal dominance with incomplete penetrance is apparent. By contrast, SQSTM1 variants are only found in up to 10% of patients with sporadic disease. It has been hypothesised that the remaining genetic susceptibility to PDB, particularly in familial cases, could be explained by rare genetic variants in loci previously identified by Genome Wide Association Studies. It is likely that polygenic factors are involved in many individuals. In this study we utilised whole exome sequencing to investigate predisposing genetic factors in an unsolved PDB kindred and identified a c.1189C > T p.L397F variant in DC-STAMP, also known as TM7SF4, that co-segregated with disease. DCSTAMP was identified as a gene of interest in PDB following Genome Wide Association Studies and has been previously shown to play critical roles in osteoclast fusion. The variant we identified has also been reported in association with PDB in a French-Canadian cohort however the significance of this variant was inconclusive. Targeted screening of DCSTAMP in our familial cohort of PDB patients revealed an additional 8 variants; however we did not find a significant association between any of these, including p.L397F, with PDB. Osteoclastogenesis assays from the affected proband and his unaffected brother demonstrated an increase in osteoclast number and nucleation, consistent with the pagetic phenotype. In converse to other established Paget's associated genetic variations such as SQSTM1, TNFRSF11A and OPTN, expression of the mutant DC-STAMP protein attenuated the activation of transcription factors NFκB and AP-1 when exogenously expressed. We found that the p.L397F variant did not influence the subcellular localization of the protein. Based on these findings we conclude that genetic variation in DCSTAMP is not a significant predisposing factor in our specific cohort of PDB patients and the p.L397F variant is unlikely to be a contributing factor in PDB pathogenesis."

Aggressive migration and invasion, as an important process, can contribute to tumor progression through infiltrating the surround normal tissue. Actin cytoskeleton rearrangement plays a key role in cells migration and invasion, involving multiple signal pathways. HGF/c-Met signal, as an important couple of oncoprotein, has been demonstrated to regulate actin cytoskeleton rearrangement. In our study, we aim to explore whether paeoniflorin can inhibit migration and invasion and actin cytoskeleton rearrangement via regulation of HGF/c-Met/RhoA/ROCK signal. Various approaches were applied to demonstrate the mechanism of paeoniflorin-mediated anticancer effect, including cell wound healing assay, invasion assay, immunofluorescence staining and transfection, and western blotting. We observed that paeoniflorin inhibited HGF-induced migration and invasion and actin cytoskeleton rearrangement in glioblastoma cells. Furthermore, the inhibition of HGF-induced migration and invasion and actin cytoskeleton rearrangement involved c-Met-mediated RhoA/ROCK signaling in glioblastoma. Thus, our study proved that paeoniflorin could inhibit migration and invasion and actin cytoskeleton rearrangement through inhibition of HGF/c-Met/RhoA/ROCK signaling in glioblastoma, suggesting that paeoniflorin might be a candidate compound to treat glioblastoma.",Learning Curve for Using Intraoperative Neural Monitoring Technology of Thyroid Cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30886865,BioMed research international,2019 03 29,"We investigated the learning curve for using intraoperative neural monitoring technology in thyroid cancer, with a view to reducing recurrent laryngeal nerve injury complications. Radical or combined radical surgery for thyroid cancer was performed in 82 patients with thyroid cancer and 147 recurrent laryngeal nerves were dissected. Intraoperative neural monitoring technology was applied and the ""four-step method"" used to monitor recurrent laryngeal nerve function. When the intraoperative signal was attenuated by more than 50%, recurrent laryngeal nerve injury was diagnosed, and the point and causes of injury were determined. The time required to identify the recurrent laryngeal nerve was 0.5-2 min and the injury rate was 2.7%; injuries were diagnosed intraoperatively. Injury most commonly occurred at or close to the point of entry of the nerve into the larynx and was caused by stretching, tumor adhesion, heat, and clamping. The groups are divided in chronological order; a learning curve for using intraoperative neural monitoring technology in thyroid cancer surgery was generated based on the time to identify the recurrent laryngeal nerve and the number of cases with nerve injury. The time to identify the recurrent laryngeal nerve and the number of injury cases decreased markedly with increasing patient numbers. There is a clear learning curve in applying intraoperative neural monitoring technology to thyroid cancer surgery; appropriate use of such technology aids in the protection of the recurrent laryngeal nerve.",Usnea Acid as Multidrug Resistance (MDR) Reversing Agent against Human Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia K562/ADR Cells via an ROS Dependent Apoptosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30886864,BioMed research international,2019 03 29,"Multidrug resistance (MDR) is a major obstacle in chemotherapy of leukemia treatments.

A total of 102 orthopedic surgeons were asked to choose anatomically contoured locking plates among 5 most commonly used types for one simple and one complex distal tibia fracture based on X-ray and CT images. Next, they were provided real-size 3D printed models of the same fractures, allowed to apply each of the 5 plates to these models, and asked if they would change their choice of plate. A 10-point numeric rating scale was provided to measure the extent of the help that 3D printing provided on preoperative planning. Finally, we asked the surgeons if they would use 3D printing in their practice. Seventy-four percent of inexperienced surgeons changed their selection of plate after using 3D printed models for the complex fracture. In contrast, only 9% of experienced surgeons changed their selection of plate for the simple fracture. Surgeons rated the extent of usefulness of the 3D models in preoperative planning as a mean of 4.84 ± 2.54 points for the simple fracture and 6.63 ± 2.54 points for the complex fracture. The difference was significant (p < 0.001). Eighty-six percent of inexperienced surgeons wanted to use 3D models for complex fractures. However, only 18% of experienced surgeons wanted to use 3D printed models for simple fractures. The use of a real-size 3D-printed model often changed surgeon's preoperative selection of locking plates, especially when inexperienced surgeons evaluated a complex fracture. However, experienced surgeons did not find 3D models very useful when assessing simple fractures. Future applications of 3D models should focus on training beginners in fracture surgery, especially when complex fractures are concerned.",Extracellular Signal-Regulated Kinase Mediates Ebastine-Induced Human Follicle Dermal Papilla Cell Proliferation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30886861,BioMed research international,2019 03 29,"Ebastine is a second-generation histamine H1 receptor antagonist that is used to attenuate allergic inflammation. Ebastine has also shown to affect hair loss; however, the immunoregulatory effect of ebastine cannot completely exclude the possibility of spontaneous hair regrowth in ebastine-treated mice. In this study, we examined the effects of ebastine on the growth of human follicle dermal papilla cells (HFDPC) using a WST-1 cell proliferation assay and a bromodeoxyuridine incorporation assay. Ebastine was shown to significantly increase the proliferation of HFDPC. The expression levels of cell-cycle regulatory proteins and an antiapoptotic protein were increased in ebastine-treated HFDPC. Furthermore, elevated expression levels of phospho-AKT and phospho-p44/42 extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) were observed in ebastine-treated HFDPC. Ebastine-mediated HFDPC growth was completely reversed by blocking ERK kinase. The results from our present study suggest that the regulation of HFDPC proliferation by ebastine might be directly involved in hair regrowth through the ERK signaling pathway.",Identification of Candidate Genes and MicroRNAs for Acute Myocardial Infarction by Weighted Gene Coexpression Network Analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30886860,BioMed research international,2019 03 29,"Identification of potential molecular targets of acute myocardial infarction is crucial to our comprehensive understanding of the disease mechanism.

The current study aims to identify the relationship between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of G protein-coupled receptor 126 (GPR126) gene and AIS predisposition. GPR126 contains 26 exons and alternative splicing of exon 6 and exon 25 produces 4 protein-coding transcripts. We genotyped SNPs of GPR126 gene around exon 6 and exon 25 in 131 Chinese AIS patients and 132 healthy controls and provided evidence that SNP rs41289839 G>A is strongly associated with AIS susceptibility. Linkage disequilibrium analysis suggests that rs41289839 and other AIS-related SNPs were in strong LD. Next, we demonstrated that rs41289839 G>A inhibits the inclusion of exon 6 during alternative splicing, resulting in a decreased expression level of exon 6-included transcript (GPR126-exon6in) relative to the exon 6 excluded transcript (GPR126-exon6ex) by minigene assay. Chondrogenic differentiation experiment showed that GPR126-exon6in has a high expression level relative to GPR126-exon6ex during chondrogenic differentiation of hMSCs. Our findings indicate that newly discovered SNP is related to cartilage development and may provide valuable insights into the etiology and pathogenesis of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis.",Mental Health and Rheumatoid Arthritis: Toward Understanding the Emotional Status of People with Chronic Disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30886858,BioMed research international,2019 03 29,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a long-term disorder significantly impairing the somatic, emotional, and psychological functioning of its sufferers.

This begs the question whether sufferers differ in intensities of pain, anxiety, and depression depending on the type of treatment and what the determinants of these affective states in patients treated using different methods are.",The Effectiveness of Sterile Wound Drapes in the Prevention of Surgical Site Infection in Thoracic Surgery.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30886857,BioMed research international,2019 03 29,"The rate of surgical site infections (SSIs) has decreased in parallel to advances in sterilization techniques. Such infections increase morbidity and hospitalization costs. The use of iodine-impregnated sterile wound drapes (SWDs) is recommended to prevent or reduce the incidence of these infections. However, there is a paucity of data regarding their use in thoracic surgical procedures. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effectiveness of sterile wound drapes in the prevention of these infections and the effects on hospitalization costs."

This is a serious public health and social problem throughout the world and it is highly challenging to identify which SC was consumed by the drug abusers, a necessary step to tie adverse health effects to the new drug's toxicity. Two intrinsic properties complicate SC identification, their often rapid and extensive metabolism, and their generally high potency relative to the natural psychoactive Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol in cannabis. Additional challenges are the lack of reference standards for the major urinary metabolites needed for forensic verification, and the sometimes differing illicit and licit status and, in some cases, identical metabolites produced by closely related SC pairs, i.e., JWH-018/AM-2201, THJ-018/THJ-2201, and BB-22/MDMB-CHMICA/ADB-CHMICA. We review current SC prevalence, establish the necessity for SC metabolism investigation and contrast the advantages and disadvantages of multiple metabolic approaches. The human hepatocyte incubation model for determining a new SC's metabolism is highly recommended after comparison to human liver microsomes incubation, in silico prediction, rat in vivo, zebrafish, and fungus Cunninghamella elegans models. We evaluate SC metabolic patterns, and devise a practical strategy to select optimal urinary marker metabolites for SCs. New SCs are incubated first with human hepatocytes and major metabolites are then identified by high-resolution mass spectrometry. Although initially difficult to obtain, authentic human urine samples following the specified SC exposure are hydrolyzed and analyzed by high-resolution mass spectrometry to verify identified major metabolites. Since some SCs produce the same major urinary metabolites, documentation of the specific SC consumed may require identification of the SC parent itself in either blood or oral fluid. An encouraging trend is the recent reduction in the number of new SC introduced per year. With global collaboration and communication, we can improve education of the public about the toxicity of new SC and our response to their introduction.",Enhanced Cycling Stability of Cation Disordered Rock-Salt Li1.2Ti0.4Mn0.4O2 Material by Surface Modification With Al2O3.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30886844,Frontiers in chemistry,2019 03 29,"Cation disordered rock-salt lithium-excess oxides are promising candidate cathode materials for next-generation electric vehicles due to their extra high capacities. However, one major issue for these materials is the distinct decline of discharge capacities during charge/discharge cycles. In this study, Al2O3 layers were coated on cation disordered Li1.2Ti0.4Mn0.4O2 (LTMO) using atomic layer deposition (ALD) method to optimize its electrochemical performance. The discharge capacity after 15 cycles increased from 228.1 to 266.7 mAh g-1 for LTMO after coated with Al2O3 for 24 ALD cycles, and the corresponding capacity retention enhanced from 79.7 to 90.9%. The improved cycling stability of the coated sample was ascribed to the alleviation of oxygen release and the inhibition on the undesirable side reactions. Our work has provided a new possible solution to address some of the capacity fading issues related to the cation disordered rock-salt cathode materials.",Recent Advances on the Analysis of Polychrome Works of Art: SERS of Synthetic Colorants and Their Mixtures With Natural Dyes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30886843,Frontiers in chemistry,2019 03 29,"The development and application of proper sample pretreatments is often a key step toward the successful analysis of dyes used as artists' materials by surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS). Complexation of the organic colorants with metal ions to dye fabrics and produce lake pigments, as well as undesired interactions with other matrix components such as substrate, binding media, fillers, and extenders, are just some of the issues that typically complicate dye identification in minute samples from invaluable artworks and museum objects. These concerns may be addressed by using, prior to SERS analysis, ad-hoc sample pretreatments that, in addition to increasing the technique's sensitivity, favorably affect its selectivity toward certain molecules or molecular classes. The present work describes a newly developed sample pretreatment based on the use of nitric acid that has proven crucial for the successful detection of aniline and xanthene dyes-the first synthetic organic colorants to be used in printing and painting, among other art forms-in microscopic samples from works of art such as a 19th-century silk fabric, paper cut-outs by Henri Matisse, Vincent Van Gogh's Irises, and Japanese woodblock prints. This treatment promotes the hydrolysis of the dye-metal bond in mordant dyes or lake pigments, resulting in a more efficient adsorption of the dye molecules on the SERS-active substrate and, hence, enabling the acquisition of high-quality spectra. In the case of synthetic colorants, this method shows advantages over hydrolysis with hydrofluoric acid-a procedure previously established for the analysis of red lakes prepared from natural dyes. The nitric acid treatment presented here may be integrated into a multi-step methodology that, by exploiting differences in solubility of various dyes and lake pigments, has enabled for the first time to successfully characterize intentional mixtures of natural and synthetic colorants of the xanthene and anthraquinone molecular classes, i.e., eosin Y and carmine, in a selection of Japanese prints of the Meiji era. The present study paves the way for the systematic identification of synthetic dyes in objects of artistic and archeological interest, even when they are present in mixtures with natural organic colorants.",CO2 Electroreduction in Ionic Liquids.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30886842,Frontiers in chemistry,2019 03 29,"CO2 electroreduction is among the most promising approaches used to transform this green-house gas into useful fuels and chemicals. Ionic liquids (ILs) have already proved to be the adequate media for CO2 dissolution, activation, and stabilization of radical and ionic electrochemical active species in aqueous solutions. In general, IL electrolytes reduce the overpotential, increase the current density, and allow for the modulation of solution pH, driving product selectivity. However, little is known about the main role of these salts in the CO2 reduction process the assumption that ILs form solvent-separated ions. However, most of the ILs in solution are better described as anisotropic fluids and display properties of an extended cooperative network of supramolecular species. That strongly reflects their mesoscopic and nanoscopic organization, inducing different processes in CO2 reduction compared to those observed in classical electrolyte solutions. The major aspects concerning the relationship between the structural organization of ILs and the electrochemical reduction of CO2 will be critically discussed considering selected recent examples.",Upconversion Nanocomposite Materials With Designed Thermal Response for Optoelectronic Devices.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30886841,Frontiers in chemistry,2019 03 29,"Upconversion is a non-linear optical phenomenon by which low energy photons stimulate the emission of higher energy ones. Applications of upconversion materials are wide and cover diverse areas such as bio-imaging, solar cells, optical thermometry, displays, and anti-counterfeiting technologies, among others. When these materials are synthesized in the form of nanoparticles, the effect of temperature on the optical emissions depends critically on their size, creating new opportunities for innovation. However, it remains a challenge to achieve upconversion materials that can be easily processed for their direct application or for the manufacture of optoelectronic devices. In this work, we developed nanocomposite materials based on upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) dispersed in a polymer matrix of either polylactic acid or poly(methyl methacrylate). These materials can be processed from solution to form thin film multilayers, which can be patterned by applying soft-lithography techniques to produce the desired features in the micro-scale, and luminescent tracks when used as nanocomposite inks. The high homogeneity of the films, the uniform distribution of the UCNPs and the easygoing deposition process are the distinctive features of such an approach. Furthermore, the size-dependent thermal properties of UCNPs can be exploited by a proper formulation of the nanocomposites in order to develop materials with high thermal sensitivity and a thermochromic response. Here, we thus present different strategies for designing optical devices through patterning techniques, ink dispensing and multilayer stacking. By applying upconverting nanocomposites with unique thermal responses, local heating effects in designed nanostructures were observed.","Nine Cases of Methanogenic Archaea in Refractory Sinusitis, an Emerging Clinical Entity.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30886840,Frontiers in public health,2019 03 29,"The authors report the cases of 9 patients eventually diagnosed with methanogenic archaea refractory or recalcitrant chronic rhinosinusitis, a condition known to involve various anaerobic bacteria but in which the role of methanogenic archaea is unknown. The authors retrospectively searched these microorganisms by PCR in surgically-collected sinusal pus specimens from patients diagnosed with refractory sinusitis, defined by the persistance of sinus inflammation and related-symptoms for more than 12 weeks despite appropriate treatment. Of the 116 tested sinus surgical specimens, 12 (10.3%) from 9 patients (six females, three males; aged 20-71 years) were PCR-positive. These specimens were further investigated by fluorescence in-situ hybridization, PCR amplicon-sequencing and culture. Methanobrevibacter smithii was documented in four patients and Methanobrevibacter oralis in another four, one of whom was also culture-positive. They were associated with a mixed flora including Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. In the latter patient, ""Methanobrevibacter massiliense"" was the sole microorganism detected. These results highlight methanogenic archaea as being part of a mixed anaerobic flora involved in refractory sinusitis, and suggest that the treatment of this condition should include an antibiotic active against methanogens, notably a nitroimidazole derivative.",Using Deliberative Pedagogy as a Tool for Critical Thinking and Career Preparation Among Undergraduate Public Health Students.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30886839,Frontiers in public health,2019 03 29,"Engagement of undergraduate public health students in active learning pedagogy has been identified as critical for recruitment, retention, and career preparation efforts. One such tool for engagement that has proven successful in STEM programs is deliberative pedagogy, where it is used to stimulate student interest in research and policy applications of technical course content. Broadly applied, deliberative pedagogy is a consensus model of decision-making, applied as an in-class exercise, where students work in small groups and model a community task force with assigned group roles. In these groups, students collect evidence from literature and media sources, and prepare a consensus response to an assigned question. Here we present an adaptation of this pedagogy to provide undergraduates with the tools needed to actively engage in public health policy and planning work groups. This adaptation is first applied during an introductory public health course, where it is used as a tool for engagement and excitement, and as a critical thinking exercise. It additionally serves as an opportunity for students to apply information literacy skills and engage with research and policy initiatives discussed in class. The same tool is reintroduced prior to graduation in a capstone course, where the emphasis shifts to application of research skills and analytical concepts. The activity is also an opportunity for students to apply professional skills needed for engagement in program development, program evaluation, institutional policy, and legislative advocacy. Through application of this pedagogical tool at two critical time points in an undergraduate curriculum, students develop skills necessary for early career professionals and are better prepared to actively engage in policy and planning as it relates to critical public health initiatives, both locally and globally.",Sex and Sleep: Perceptions of Sex as a Sleep Promoting Behavior in the General Adult Population.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30886838,Frontiers in public health,2019 03 29,"Objective: The main aim of this study was to explore the perceived relationship between sexual activities, sleep quality, and sleep latency in the general adult population and identify whether any gender differences exist.

These findings indicate that the public perceive sexual activity with orgasm precedes improved sleep outcomes. Promoting safe sexual activity before bed may offer a novel behavioral strategy for promoting sleep.",Recommendations for the Establishment and Operation of Human Milk Banks in Europe: A Consensus Statement From the European Milk Bank Association (EMBA).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30886837,Frontiers in pediatrics,2019 03 29,"Objectives: To develop recommendations from the European Milk Bank Association (EMBA) for the establishment and operation of human milk banks (HMB) in Europe. Method: A working group comprising members of the EMBA was convened in 2015 to develop Europe-wide recommendations for milk banks. Each member had experience of guideline development and/or milk banking operations. An initial survey was agreed using collated published global recommendations. A total of 108 potential recommendations were included in the survey; responders noted which were included in their national guidelines. The responses were collated, compared, and discussed and the group determined where there was consensus and where substantial or minor differences were identified. Where there was consensus or robust published evidence on which to base recommendations these were included. When there was no consensus and no clear evidence base, a statement of explanation based on collective expert opinion was agreed. Results: Published, internationally available guidelines with recommendations for human milk banks from France, Italy, and the UK, together with guidelines from Austria, Denmark, Germany, Norway, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland were included as source materials. These covered: General recommendations; Donor recruitment and screening; Expression, handling, and storage of donor human milk (DHM); Pooling of DHM; Milk screening; Milk treatment (pasteurization); Delivery of DHM to recipients. Conclusions: Evidence based recommendations and consensus statements from the EMBA will now be published on the EMBA website to assist in the safe establishment and operation of HMBs throughout Europe. These have also been used to inform the chapter on human milk to be included in the 2019 edition of the Guide to the quality and safety of tissues and cells for human application, published by the European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines & HealthCare (EDQM).",Comparative study on long-term stability in mandibular sagittal split ramus osteotomy: hydroxyapatite/poly-l-lactide mesh versus titanium miniplate.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30886836,Maxillofacial plastic and reconstructive surgery,2019 03 29,"Resorbable devices have recently been adopted in the field of orthognathic surgery with controversies about their postoperative skeletal stability.

Toxic metals contamination is an important environmental problem that was mainly manifested in the growing industrial cities where the levels in toxic metals exceeded the recommended levels leading to the increase of several health problems (that vary from memory disorder to carcinogenic diseases). The main sources of food contamination by toxic metals are the increase in petroleum fuels exhausts and the addition of fertilizers and metal-based pesticides during farming processes. Nowadays, the non-alcoholic drinks represent one of the highest consumption groups worldwide especially in the Middle East and Islamic countries. The current work aims to investigate the safety of some non-alcoholic beverages (carbonated drinks, flavored yogurt drinks and juice drinks) from toxic metal contamination in the Egyptian market. The study revealed that non-alcoholic beverage samples (juices, flavored yogurts and carbonated drinks) in the Egyptian market are mostly free of lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd) and chromium (Cr) contamination.

We sought to evaluate the impact of men's perceptions of healthcare quality on obtaining a screening PSA for the early detection of prostate cancer. A retrospective secondary data analysis was conducted of men ages 55-69 without a history of prostate cancer using 2015 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) data. The relationship between Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) questions captured in MEPS and PSA screening in the last two years were assessed using multiple logistic regression. The analysis was carried out in October 2018 at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center. The final survey sample consisted of 1249 men that equated to 15,313,605.5 once weighted; 69.5% underwent PSA screening. Men who were offered help with filling out forms in the office (OR: 1.86, 95% CI: 1.14-3.01) or rated the quality of healthcare from their doctors ≥7 (OR: 1.63, 95% CI: 1.10-2.44) on a scale from 0 (worst healthcare) to 10 (best health care) had significantly greater adjusted odds of undergoing PSA screening. Men who rated the quality of healthcare delivered to them as high had significantly greater odds of undergoing PSA screening compared to those who rated it lower. Our results may suggest that improvements in healthcare quality and patient experience of care have the potential to positively influence PSA screening.",Rates of and characteristics associated with food insecurity differ among undergraduate and graduate students at a large public university in the Southeast United States.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30886818,Preventive medicine reports,2019 06 10,"The objective of this study was to estimate the prevalence of food insecurity and identify characteristics associated with food security status separately for undergraduate and graduate students. We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of 4819 students from a public flagship university in the Southeastern US. Students completed an online questionnaire assessing food security status over the past 12 months using the 10-item US Adult Food Security Survey Module and self-reported demographics and student characteristics. Data were collected in October and November of 2016. Analyses were stratified by student status (undergraduate or graduate). We calculated frequencies of food security status categories and used multinomial logistic regression to assess the association between food security status and student characteristics. Food insecurity rates were 25.2% for undergraduate and 17.8% for graduate students. Characteristics associated with food security status (p < .05) for undergraduates only were gender, year in school, receipt of financial aid, cooking frequency, perceived cooking skills, and having a meal plan. For graduate students only, characteristics included age, marital status, having dependent children, enrollment status, and body mass index. Characteristics associated with food security status across both groups included race/ethnicity, perceived health, international student, and employment status. While most prior studies of college food insecurity look only at undergraduate students or combine undergraduate and graduate students into one group, we found differences between undergraduate and graduate students. It is important to consider undergraduate and graduate students as two separate groups as strategies that would be most effective for addressing food insecurity may differ between them.",School contextual correlates of physical activity among a national adolescent sample.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30886817,Preventive medicine reports,2019 06 10,"Schools are an important context to promote adolescent physical activity (PA). However, following ecologic frameworks, little is known about the influence of multiple school contextual levels - environment and policy - on adolescent PA. This study aimed to examine associations of school neighborhood environment factors and state laws with PA, and the moderating effects of school neighborhood socioeconomic status (SES) on these associations. Analyses used cross-sectional data from a national sample of middle (n = 387) and high (n = 591) school adolescents from the Family Life, Activity, Sun, Health, and Eating study conducted in 2014. Outcomes included self-report school-time PA and active transport to/from school (ATS), and estimated minutes/week of school-related moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) and total MVPA. Separate regression models for middle and high school respondents examined state laws (school PA or physical education (PE) time requirements) and school neighborhood factors (density, age, and commute times), and their interactions with school neighborhood SES, in relation to each PA outcome, adjusting for socio-demographic and psychosocial factors. The high school models showed strong PE laws (B[SE]: 0.3[0.1], p = 0.02) and any PA law (B[SE]: 0.3[0.1], p = 0.0003) were related to higher school-time PA, and shorter school neighborhood commute times were related to lower ATS (OR [95% CI]: 0.4 [0.2-0.7]). We found similar associations with estimated school-related MVPA. The middle school models showed no significant state law or school neighborhood main effects. Interactions with school neighborhood SES were not significant. Our findings provide further support for state laws to promote PA in school regardless of school neighborhood SES.",The role of provider characteristics on the hepatitis A and B vaccination status of adults in the United States during 2007-2015.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30886816,Preventive medicine reports,2019 06 10,"Hepatitis A and B vaccine coverage is suboptimal in US adults, even among those at increased risk for infection, morbidity, or mortality. To understand where medical education and resources might enhance vaccine coverage, it is important to first identify providers and places most commonly associated with the administration of hepatitis vaccinations. We conducted a retrospective analysis of commercial and Medicare insurance claims data from 2007 to 2015 to describe provider types and places of vaccination against hepatitis A and B among adults in the US, and estimated the time to initial vaccination from first diagnosis of a condition for which the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends hepatitis A and/or B vaccination among at-risk adults. We identified 183,326 adults who received hepatitis A vaccine, 148,119 hepatitis B vaccine, and 64,953 a bivalent vaccine. Mean age was 42.1-45.8 years.

The purpose of this evaluation study was to determine if YMCA members would participate in a loyalty point incentive program and if the weekly YMCA visit rates differed between Air Miles collectors and non-collectors. YMCA swipe data were collected from 2012 to 2016, including 12 months pre-program (baseline data), 36 months during the intervention period, and 3 months post-program. The final analyses, conducted in 2017, included 459,146 participants from 13 YMCA locations. Quasi-Poisson regression models were used to compare the weekly visit rates between Air Miles collectors and non-collectors. Of the 459,146 participants, 6.4% (n = 29,449) registered their Air Miles card with their YMCA membership (Air Miles collectors). Average weekly visit rates over the entire study period were significantly higher (1.37 to 3.84 times) among the Air Miles collector group than those in the non-collector group, but there was no evidence that incentives were associated with increased YMCA visits when adjusting for the pre-program period. This research demonstrated that incentives are a practical and acceptable public health strategy in Canada. More research is needed into how to harness the reach of loyalty point providers such as Air Miles, and how incentive-based programs should be optimally designed and delivered (e.g., type, timing, and magnitude of incentive).",The mental health impacts of health and human service work: Longitudinal evidence about differential exposure and susceptibility using 16 waves of cohort data.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30886814,Preventive medicine reports,2019 06 10,"The health and human care workforce comprise a substantial and increasing proportion of the employed population in high income countries.

This paper assessed psychosocial working conditions among health and human care workers compared to other workers. We also examined the effects of psychosocial working conditions on mental health. The data source was 16 waves of the Household Income Labour Dynamics in Australia survey. The exposure was a multidimensional, previously validated psychosocial job quality index. The outcome was changes in the Mental Health Inventory-5 (MHI-5). The effect modifier was a multicategory health and human care occupational variable. Random and fixed effects linear regression models were used to unpack between- versus within- person differences. Time varying confounders were controlled for. We found evidence of effect modification. Carers and support workers experienced a 4.90-point decline (95% CI -6.23 to 3.57) on the MHI-5 when reporting 3 or more job stressors compared to no stressors. These workers also reported lower levels of mental health than other occupational groups and had greater exposure to poor psychosocial working environments. Health workers also reported substantial declines on the MHI-5 when exposed to 3 or more job stressors (-3.50, 95% CI -5.05 to -1.94).

Previous studies have shown that tumor vasculature and extracellular matrix regulate the transvascular and interstitial transport of nanoparticles, both critical for successfully delivering nanomedicine into solid tumors. Within the malignant tumor microenvironment, blood vessels are morphologically abnormal and functionally exhibit substantial permeability. Furthermore, the tumor extracellular matrix (ECM), unlike that of the normal tissue parenchyma, is densely packed with collagen. These pathophysiological properties greatly impede intratumoral delivery of nanomaterials. By using an antivascular endothelial growth factor receptor antibody, DC101, and an antitransforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1) antibody, normalization of the tumor vasculature and ECM is achieved, respectively, in a syngeneic murine glioma model. This normalization effect results in a more organized vascular network, improves tissue perfusion, and reduces collagen density, all of which contribute to enhanced nanoparticle delivery and distribution within tumors. These findings suggest that combined vascular and ECM normalization strategies can be used to remodel the tumor microenvironment and improve nanomedicine delivery into solid tumors, which has significant implications for developing more effective combinational therapeutic strategies using cancer nanomedicine.",Robust Photodynamic Therapy Using 5-ALA-Incorporated Nanocomplexes Cures Metastatic Melanoma through Priming of CD4+CD8+ Double Positive T Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30886812,"Advanced science (Weinheim, Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany)",2019 03 29,"Advanced melanoma can rarely be cured. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) readily eradicates the primary melanoma but has limited ability to destroy the spreading tumor cells unless supported by other combinative interventions to augment systemic antitumor immunity. Based on the previously synthesized penetration-enhancing biomaterials, a topically administered nanoformulation is developed, which profoundly assists 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) in circumventing skin barrier to be selectively delivered to tumor cells. After endocytosis, accumulated 5-ALA is efficiently metabolized to a photosensitizer protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) which stimulates a large production of cytotoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) under illumination. Accompanied by the robust inflammatory responses followed by primary tumor destruction, CD4+CD8+ double positive T cells are highly boosted to harness host immunity to purge metastases in lymphoid organs. Compared with dacarbazine and programmed death 1 (PD-1) antibody, this treatment in advanced melanoma murine models, achieves a striking curable rate of 90% without melanoma prognostic markers LDH and S-100B detection, followed by a relapse-free survival rate of 83.33% in 300 days. Moreover, the cured mice's immune system function recovers to an extent similar to healthy mice without prolonged or exaggerated inflammation. This study using the synergistic biomaterials approach may thus render 5-ALA-mediated PDT a potentially curative therapy for advanced melanoma in clinic.",AIE Multinuclear Ir(III) Complexes for Biocompatible Organic Nanoparticles with Highly Enhanced Photodynamic Performance.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30886811,"Advanced science (Weinheim, Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany)",2019 03 29,"The singlet oxygen (1O2) generation ability of a photosensitizer (PS) is pivotal for photodynamic therapy (PDT). Transition metal complexes are effective PSs, owing to their high 1O2 generation ability. However, non-negligible cellular toxicity, poor biocompatibility, and easy aggregation in water limit their biomedical applications. In this work, a series of red-emitting aggregation-induced emission (AIE) Ir(III) complexes containing different numbers of Ir centers (mono-, di-, and trinuclear) and the corresponding nanoparticles (NPs) AIE-NPs, are designed and synthesized. The increase of 1O2 generation ability is in line with the increasing number of Ir centers. Compared with the pure Ir(III) complexes, the corresponding NPs offer multiple advantages: (i) brighter emission; (ii) higher phosphorescence quantum yields; (iii) longer excited lifetime; (iv) higher 1O2 generation ability; (v) better biocompatibility; and (vi) superior cellular uptake. Both in vitro and in vivo experiments corroborate that AIE-NPs with three iridium centers possess potent cytotoxicity toward cancer cells and effective inhibition of tumor growth. To the best of knowledge, this work is the first example of NPs of multinuclear AIE Ir(III) complexes as PSs for enhanced PDT. This study offers a new method to improve the efficiency of PSs for clinical cancer treatments."

Two types of Zr-MOFs, UiO-66 and MOF-808, are investigated owing to their respectable moisture and chemical stabilities. The MOFs while serving as an interlayer in conjunction with the perovskite film are shown to possess the advantages of UV-filtering capability and enhancing perovskite crystallinity. Consequently, the UiO-66/MOF-808-modified PVSCs yield enhanced power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 17.01% and 16.55%, outperforming the control device (15.79%). While further utilizing a perovskite/Zr-MOF hybrid heterojunction to fabricate the devices, the hybrid MOFs are found to possibly distribute over the perovskite grain boundary providing a grain-locking effect to simultaneously passivate the defects and to reinforce the film's robustness against moisture invasion. As a result, the PCEs of the UiO-66/MOF-808-hybrid PVSCs are further enhanced to 18.01% and 17.81%, respectively. Besides, over 70% of the initial PCE is retained after being stored in air (25 °C and relative humidity of 60 ± 5%) for over 2 weeks, in contrast to the quick degradation observed for the control device. This study demonstrates the promising potential of using perovskite/MOF heterojunctions to fabricate efficient and stable PVSCs.",Targeted Therapy against Metastatic Melanoma Based on Self-Assembled Metal-Phenolic Nanocomplexes Comprised of Green Tea Catechin.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30886799,"Advanced science (Weinheim, Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany)",2019 03 29,"The targeted therapy of metastatic melanoma is an important yet challenging goal that has received only limited attention to date. Herein, green tea polyphenols, (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), and lanthanide metal ions (Sm3+) are used as building blocks to engineer self-assembled SmIII-EGCG nanocomplexes with synergistically enhanced tumor inhibitory properties. These nanocomplexes have negligible systemic toxic effects on healthy cells but cause a significant reduction in the viability of melanoma cells by efficiently regulating their metabolic pathways. Moreover, the wound-induced migration of melanoma cells can be efficiently inhibited by SmIII-EGCG, which is a key criterion for metastatic melanoma therapy. In a mouse melanoma tumor model, SmIII-EGCG is directly compared with a clinical anticancer drug, 5-fluorouracil and shows remarkable tumor inhibition. Moreover, the targeted therapy of SmIII-EGCG is shown to prevent metastatic lung melanoma from spreading to main organs with no adverse side effects on the body weight or organs. These in vivo results demonstrate significant advantages of SmIII-EGCG over its clinical counterpart. The results suggest that these green tea-based, self-assembled nanocomplexes possess all of the key traits of a clinically promising candidate to address the challenges associated with the treatment of advanced stage metastatic melanoma.",Soft Modular Electronic Blocks (SMEBs): A Strategy for Tailored Wearable Health-Monitoring Systems.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30886798,"Advanced science (Weinheim, Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany)",2019 03 29,"Precise monitoring of human body signals can be achieved by soft, conformal contact and precise arrangement of wearable devices to the desired body positions. So far, no design and fabrication methodology in soft wearable devices is able to address the variations in the form factor of the human body such as the various sizes and shapes of individual body parts, which can significantly cause misalignments and the corresponding inaccurate monitoring. Here, a concept of soft modular electronic blocks (SMEBs) enabling the assembly of soft wearable systems onto human skin with functions and layouts tailored to the form factors of individuals' bodies is presented. Three types of SMEBs are developed as fundamental building blocks for functional modularization. The physical design of SMEBs is optimized for a mechanically stable island-bridge configuration. The prepared SMEBs can be integrated onto a target body part through rapid, room-temperature (RT) assembly (<5 s) using an oxygen plasma-induced siloxane bonding method.

Herein, engineered polymeric stomatocytes are presented as a structural and functional mimic of red blood cells (RBCs) with multifunctional therapeutic features. Stomatocytes, comprising biodegradable poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(D,L-lactide), possess an oblate-like morphology reminiscent of RBCs. This unique dual-compartmentalized structure is augmented via encapsulation of multifunctional cargo (oxygen-binding hemoglobin and the photosensitizer chlorin e6). Furthermore, stomatocytes are decorated with a cell membrane isolated from erythrocytes to ensure that the surface characteristics matched those of RBCs. In vivo biodistribution data reveal that both the uncoated and coated nano-RBCs have long circulation times in mice, with the membrane-coated ones outperforming the uncoated stomatoctyes. The capacity of nano-RBCs to transport oxygen and create oxygen radicals upon exposure to light is effectively explored toward photodynamic therapy, using 2D and 3D tumor models; addressing the challenge presented by cancer-induced hypoxia. The morphological and functional control demonstrated by this synthetic nanosystem, coupled with indications of therapeutic efficacy, constitutes a highly promising platform for future clinical application.","Synthesis of a MoS

Nevertheless, limited tissue penetration of near-infrared (NIR) laser and the serious side effects of high-dose radiation severely hinder its applications for deep tumors. An interventional photothermal-brachytherapy (IPT-BT) technology is proposed here for the internal site-specific treatment of deep tumors. This technology utilizes a kind of biodegradable honeycomb-like gold nanoparticles (HGNs) acting as both internal photothermal agents and radiosensitizers. A high tumor inhibition rate of 96.6% is achieved in SW1990 orthotopic pancreatic tumor-bearing mice by HGNs-mediated IPT-BT synergistic therapy. Interestingly, this approach effectively causes double-stranded DNA damage and improves the oxygen supply and the penetration of nanoparticles inside the tumor.

Due to their unique electrical, optical, and magnetic properties, they have potential for various applications such as electronics and optoelectronics. Owing to thermal motion and lattice growth kinetics, different atomic-scale structures (ASSs) can originate from natural or intentional regulation of 2D material atomic configurations. The transformations of ASSs can result in the variation of the charge density, electronic density of state and lattice symmetry so that the property tuning of 2D materials can be achieved and the functional devices can be constructed. Here, several kinds of ASSs of 2D materials are introduced, including grain boundaries, atomic defects, edge structures, and stacking arrangements. The design strategies of these structures are also summarized, especially for atomic defects and edge structures.

Here, directional freezing is used followed by a solvent replacement method to prepare aligned nanocomposite ionogels which exhibit enhanced ionic conductivity, good mechanical strength, and thermal stability simultaneously. The aligned ionogel based supercapacitor achieves a 29% higher specific capacitance (176 F g-1 at 25 °C and 1 A g-1) than an equivalent nonaligned form. Notably, this thermally stable aligned ionogel has a high ionic conductivity of 22.1 mS cm-1 and achieves a high specific capacitance of 167 F g-1 at 10 A g-1 and 200 °C.

It is now possible to obtain vast quantities of DNA data from ancient specimens in a high-throughput manner and use this information to investigate the dynamics and evolution of past microbial communities. However, we still know very little about how the characteristics of ancient DNA influence our ability to accurately assign microbial taxonomies (i.e. identify species) within ancient metagenomic samples. Here, we use both simulated and published metagenomic data sets to investigate how ancient DNA characteristics affect alignment-based taxonomic classification. We find that nucleotide-to-nucleotide, rather than nucleotide-to-protein, alignments are preferable when assigning taxonomies to short DNA fragment lengths routinely identified within ancient specimens (<60 bp). We determine that deamination (a form of ancient DNA damage) and random sequence substitutions corresponding to ∼100,000 years of genomic divergence minimally impact alignment-based classification. We also test four different reference databases and find that database choice can significantly bias the results of alignment-based taxonomic classification in ancient metagenomic studies. Finally, we perform a reanalysis of previously published ancient dental calculus data, increasing the number of microbial DNA sequences assigned taxonomically by an average of 64.2-fold and identifying microbial species previously unidentified in the original study.

Recent studies show that gut microbiota diversity and functional activity are synchronized with the host circadian rhythms in healthy individuals, and circadian disruption elicits dysbiosis in mammalian models. However, no studies have determined the associations between circadian disruption in early life, microbiota colonization, and the consequences for microbiota structure in birds. Chickens, as a major source of protein around the world, are one of the most important agricultural species, and their gut and metabolic health are significant concerns. The poultry industry routinely employs extended photoperiods (>18 h light) as a management tool, and their impacts on the chicken circadian, its role in gut microbiota acquisition in early life (first 3 weeks of life), and consequences for later life microbiota structure remain unknown. In this study, the objectives were to (a) characterize circadian activity under two different light regimes in layer chicken (12/12 h' Light/Dark (LD) and 23/1 h LD), (b) characterize gut microbiota acquisition and composition in the first 4 weeks of life, (c) determine if gut microbiota oscillate in synchrony with the host circadian rhythm, and (d) to determine if fecal microbiota is representative of cecal microbiota in early life. Expression of clock genes (clock, bmal1, and per2) was assayed, and fecal and cecal microbiotas were characterized using 16S rRNA gene amplicon analyses from birds raised under two photoperiod treatments. Chickens raised under 12/12 LD photoperiods exhibited rhythmic clock gene activity, which was absent in birds raised under the extended (23/1 LD) photoperiod. There was differential microbiota acquisition under different photoperiod regimes in newly hatched chicks. Gut microbiota members showed a similar oscillating pattern as the host, but this association was not as strong as found in mammals. Finally, the fecal microbiota was found to be not representative of cecal microbiota membership and structure in young birds. This is one of the first studies to demonstrate the use of photoperiods to modulate microbiota acquisition in newly hatched chicks, and show their potential as a tool to promote the colonization of beneficial microorganisms.",Coral-algal interactions at Weizhou Island in the northern South China Sea: variations by taxa and the exacerbating impact of sediments trapped in turf algae.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30886777,PeerJ,2019 03 29,"Competitive interactions between corals and benthic algae are increasingly frequent on degrading coral reefs, but the processes and mechanisms surrounding the interactions, as well as the exacerbating effects of sediments trapped in turf algae, are poorly described.

Our data indicated that turf algae were the main algal competitors for each surveyed coral genus and the proportion of algal contact along the coral edges varied significantly among the coral genera and the algal types. The proportions of algal wins between corals and turf algae or macroalgae differed significantly among coral genera. Compared to macroalgae, turf algae consistently yielded more algal wins and fewer coral wins on all coral genera. Amongst the coral genera, Porites was the most easily damaged by algal competition. The proportions of turf algal wins on the coral genera increased 1.1-1.9 times in the presence of sediments. Furthermore, the proportions of algal wins on massive and encrusting corals significantly increased with the combination of sediments and turf algae as the algal type. However, the variation in proportions of algal wins between massive and encrusting corals disappeared as sediments became trapped in turf algae.

The ecotoxic effects of DBP on aquatic organisms have not been fully investigated. This study investigates acute toxicity, oxidative damage, and antioxidant enzyme parameters in neonate and adult Daphnia magna exposed to DBP. The obtained results show comparable DBP toxic responses in neonates and adults. The median lethal concentrations (LC50) of DBP in neonates exposed for 24 and 48 h were 3.48 and 2.83 mg/L, respectively. The LC50 of adults for the same DBP exposure durations were 4.92 and 4.31 mg/L, respectively. Increased hydrogen peroxide and malondialdehyde were found in neonates and adults at both 24 and 48 h, while the total antioxidant capacity decreased. Superoxide dismutase activity increased significantly in neonates and adults exposed to 0.5 mg/L DBP, and subsequently diminished at higher DBP concentrations and prolonged exposure. Catalase and glutathione S-transferases activities both decreased markedly in neonates and adults. The changes observed were found to be time and concentration dependent. Overall, these data indicated that the acute toxic effects of DBP exposure on neonates were more pronounced than in adults, and oxidative injury may be the main mechanism of DBP toxicity.

Ten dissolved heavy metals (V, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, Mo, Cd, Ba, and Pb) in the Zhujiang River water exhibit little variation at temporal scale, but vary with a significant spatial heterogeneity. Furthermore, different metals present different variation trends along the main channel of the Zhujiang River. Our results suggest that Ba (14.72 μg L-1 in low flow season and 12.50 μg L-1 in high flow season) and Cr (6.85 μg L-1 in low flow season and 7.52 μg L-1 in high flow season) are consistently the most abundant metals in the two sampling periods. According to the water quality index (WQI values ranged from 1.3 to 43.9) and health risk assessment, metals investigated in Zhujiang River are below the hazard level (all hazard index (HI) < 1). Application of statistical approaches, including correlation matrix and principal component analysis (PCA), identify three principal components that account for 61.74% of the total variance, the results conclude that the anthropogenic heavy metals (V, Cr, Ni, and Cu) are greatly impacted by the dilution effect, and the heavy metals in Zhujiang River are mainly presented a natural sources signature from the perspective of entire basin. Moreover, our results reveal that the estimated export budget of several heavy metals including V (735.6 t year-1), Cr (1,561.1 t year-1), Ni (498.2 t year-1), and Mo (118.9 t year-1) to the ocean are higher than the world average.",Identification of Austwickia chelonae as cause of cutaneous granuloma in endangered crocodile lizards using metataxonomics.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30886772,PeerJ,2019 03 29,"The crocodile lizard (Shinisaurus crocodilurus Ahl, 1930) is an endangered reptile species, and in recent years many have died from diseases, especially the rescued and breeding individuals. However, pathogens underlying these diseases are unclear. In this study, we report our effort in rapidly identifying and isolating the pathogen that causes high mortality in crocodile lizards from Guangdong Luokeng Shinisaurus crocodilurus National Nature Reserve. The typical symptom is cutaneous granuloma in the infected crocodile lizards. Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) is a comprehensive approach for sequence-based identification of pathogenic microbes. In this study, 16S rDNA based mNGS was used for rapid identification of pathogens, and microscopy and microbe isolation were used to confirm the results. Austwickia chelonae was identified to be the dominant pathogen in the granuloma using 16S rDNA based mNGS. Chinese skinks were used as an animal model to verify the pathogenicity of A. chelonae to fulfill Koch's postulates. As expected, subcutaneous inoculation of A. chelonae induced granulomas in the healthy Chinese skinks and the A. chelonae was re-isolated from the induced granulomas. Therefore, A. chelonae was the primary pathogen that caused this high mortality disease, cutaneous granuloma, in crocodile lizards from Guangdong Luokeng Shinisaurus crocodilurus National Nature Reserve. Antibiotics analysis demonstrated that A. chelonae was sensitive to cephalothin, minocycline and ampicillin, but not to kanamycin, gentamicin, streptomycin and clarithromycin, suggesting a possible treatment for the infected crocodile lizards. However, surgical resection of the nodules as early as possible was recommended.

In vitro dissolution comparison demonstrated that a urea/paclitaxel-based coating formulation (IN.PACT™ Admiral™) released drug from solid to soluble phase at a slower and constant rate, yielding approximately 7% solubilized drug in 24 h. In contrast, a coating formulated from polysorbate/sorbitol/paclitaxel (Lutonix™) released 51% of solid phase drug to soluble phase in 1 h of dissolution with the remainder solubilizing in 24 h. In vivo evaluation of tissue drug concentration of both products showed significantly different tissue pharmacokinetic profile, with a higher concentration of paclitaxel in tissue at 90 days with a urea-based formulation excipient. Histological comparison of smooth muscle cell loss in response to drug exposure revealed contrasting trends of smooth muscle cell loss from 28 to 90 days with significantly higher response to drug observed at 90 days with the urea-based formulation. Rapid dissolution of drug from the polysorbate/sorbitol coating formulation was associated with an early increase in local cellular response to drug which diminished over 90 days with clearance of local drug from tissue. Sustained long-term drug-in-tissue concentration associated with the urea-based formulation demonstrated sustained pharmacological activity at 90 days, suggesting that slow coating dissolution provides a sustainable long-term tissue response.",Evaluation of the Molecular State of Piperine in Cyclodextrin Complexes by Near-Infrared Spectroscopy and Solid-State Fluorescence Measurements.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30886749,International journal of medicinal chemistry,2019 03 29,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the physicochemical properties of piperine (PP) in ground mixtures (GMs) of PP with α-, β-, or γ-cyclodextrin (CD) under conditions of humidity, heat, and humidity-heat. In solid-state fluorescence measurements, the fluorescence maxima for GM (PP/αCD = 1/2), GM (PP/βCD = 1/1), and GM (PP/γCD = 1/1) were observed at 463, 472, and 469 nm, respectively. On the other hand, the humidified GMs exhibited maxima at 454, 460, and 465 nm, while the humidified-heated samples displayed fluorescence maxima at 455, 455, and 469 nm, respectively. Therefore, the molecular behavior of PP with α, β, and γCD was concluded to vary upon the coordination of water molecules.

We assessed the likelihood of ""Encephalopathy only Stroke Codes (EoSC)"" resulting in a true stroke (EoSC CVA+) final diagnosis. 3860 patients were analyzed in a prospective stroke code registry from 2004 to 2016. EoSC was defined using a standard and an exploratory definition. Definition 1 included EoSC patients as stroke codes where NIHSS was nonzero for LOC questions (questions la, 1b, and lc) but remainder of the NIHSS was zero. Definition 2 included the same definition but allowed symmetric pairings on motor questions (5a/5b, 6a/6b, or Question 4 scoring a 3). Groups were assessed for final diagnosis of stoke (EoSC CVA+) or not stroke (EoSC CVA-). EoSC accounted for 60/3860 (1.55%) of total stroke codes. EoSC CVA+ was found in 5/3860 (0.13%) of all stroke codes, 5/60 (8.33%) of EoSC stroke codes, and 5/1514 (0.33%) of all strokes. For Definition 2, EoSC accounted for 96/3860 (2.5%) of total stroke codes. EoSC CVA+ was found in 9/3860 (0.23%) of all stroke codes, 9/96 (9.38%) of EoSC stroke codes, and 9/1514 (0.59%) of all strokes. On multivariable logistic regression analysis, diabetes was the highest predictor of stroke (p=0.05). Encephalopathy only Stroke Codes only rarely result in cases with a true final diagnosis of stroke (EoSC CVA+), accounting for 0.1-0.2% of all stroke codes and 8-9% of EoSC stroke codes.

The family consists of p53, p63 and p73 proteins, which share similar structure and function. Activation of wild-type p53 or TAp73 in tumors leads to tumor regression, and small molecules restoring the p53 pathway are in clinical development. Protoporphyrin IX (PpIX), a metabolite of aminolevulinic acid, is a clinically approved drug applied in photodynamic diagnosis and therapy. PpIX induces p53-dependent and TAp73-dependent apoptosis and inhibits TAp73/MDM2 and TAp73/MDM4 interactions. Here we demonstrate that PpIX is a dual inhibitor of p53/MDM2 and p53/MDM4 interactions and activates apoptosis in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells without illumination and without affecting normal cells. PpIX stabilizes p53 and TAp73 proteins, induces p53-downstream apoptotic targets and provokes cancer cell death at doses non-toxic to normal cells. Our findings open up new opportunities for repurposing PpIX for treating lymphoblastic leukemia with wild-type TP53.",Low-dose 2-deoxyglucose and metformin synergically inhibit proliferation of human polycystic kidney cells by modulating glucose metabolism.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30886744,Cell death discovery,2019 03 29,"Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) is a common hereditary kidney disease with abnormal proliferation and apoptosis of kidney cystic epithelial cells, eventually leading to chronic renal failure. Currently, there are no effective treatment methods. Similar to tumor cells, cystic epithelial cells have abnormal glycolysis and over-activation of proliferation signaling pathways. In the present study, for the first time, we investigated the effects of low-dose combinational use of 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) and metformin (MET) on the proliferation and apoptosis in the human cystic kidney epithelial cells. Cystic epithelia cells were divided into control group, 2-DG group, MET group and 2-DG+MET group. Cell Proliferation, apoptosis and glucose metabolism were measured in each group. The results showed that low-dose combinational treatment of 2-DG and MET significantly inhibited the proliferation of renal cystic epithelial cells by suppressing the activities of PKA, mTOR and ERK signaling pathways and upregulating PI3K/Akt pathway. Combination of both drugs increased the apoptosis rates of cystic epithelial cells. Two drugs inhibited glucose metabolic phenotypes, glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation, and significantly lowered the intracellular ATP level in cystic epithelial cells. 2-DG could also neutralize excessive production of lactate (lactic acidosis) caused by MET and both drugs had complementary effect for cystic epithelial cells. These results reveal that combinational use of low-dose 2-DG and MET can markedly inhibit proliferation via modulating glucose metabolic phenotypes in human polycystic kidney epithelial cells, low-dose combinational use of both drugs can also lower the toxic effects of each drug, and is a novel strategy for future treatment of human polycystic kidney disease.",TRIAD3/RNF216 E3 ligase specifically synthesises K63-linked ubiquitin chains and is inactivated by mutations associated with Gordon Holmes syndrome.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30886743,Cell death discovery,2019 03 29,"TRIAD3/RNF216 is a ubiquitin ligase of the RING-in-between-RING family. Recent publications identified TRIAD3 mutations in patients with neurological diseases, including Gordon Holmes syndrome and Huntington-like disorder. To understand the functional relevance of these disease-associated mutations, we have tested the ubiquitin ligase activity of mutated TRIAD3 in vitro. Several of these point mutations completely abrogated TRIAD3's catalytic activity. Using mass spectrometry, we identified new TRIAD3-interacting proteins/substrates from mouse brain lysate, which provide a new link between TRIAD3 and processes involving clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Strikingly, we found that TRIAD3 synthesises specifically lysine-63 (K63)-linked poly-ubiquitin chains in vitro, a chain type that usually plays a role in mediating signalling events rather than triggering proteasomal degradation. Therefore, this finding is of great importance to further understand TRIAD3's cellular role and loss-of-function in disease.",Knowledge and perception about dental implants among undergraduate dental students.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30886741,BDJ open,2019 03 29,"Awareness about dental implants is increasing among dental patients, which demands a higher level of competence for dental students.

One potential approach to support meaningful learning is Productive Failure (PF). In PF, the conventional instruction process is reversed so that learners attempt to solve challenging problems ahead of receiving explicit instruction. While students often fail to produce satisfactory solutions (hence ""Failure""), these attempts help learners encode key features and learn better from subsequent instruction (hence ""Productive""). Effectiveness of PF was shown mainly in the context of statistical and intuitive concepts, and lessons that are designed and taught by learning scientists. We describe a quasi-experiment that evaluates the impact of PF in a large-enrollment introductory university-level biology course when designed and implemented by the course instructors. One course-section (295 students) learned two topics using PF; another section (279 students) learned the same topics using an active learning approach, which is the standard in this course. Performance was assessed on the subsequent midterm exam, after all students had ample opportunities for practice and feedback, and after some time has elapsed. PF students scored nearly five percentage-points higher on the relevant topics in the subsequent midterm exam. The effect was especially strong for low-performing students. Improvement on the final exam was only visible for low-performing students. We describe the intervention and its potential to transform large introductory university courses."

Over the past decades, numerous efforts have mainly focused on the study of the RBC biomechanical properties that arise from the unique deformability of erythrocytes. Here, we demonstrate nonlinear optical effects from human RBCs suspended in different osmotic solutions. Specifically, we observe self-trapping and scattering-resistant nonlinear propagation of a laser beam through RBC suspensions under all three osmotic conditions, where the strength of the optical nonlinearity increases with osmotic pressure on the cells. This tunable nonlinearity is attributed to optical forces, particularly the forward-scattering and gradient forces. Interestingly, in aged blood samples (with lysed cells), a notably different nonlinear behavior is observed due to the presence of free hemoglobin. We use a theoretical model with an optical force-mediated nonlocal nonlinearity to explain the experimental observations.

In this paper, we propose the first experimental realization of a remote cloaking device that makes any object located at a certain distance invisible at direct current (DC) frequency. A negative resistor network with active elements is used to achieve the remote function of the DC cloak. Based on this network, the cloak can remotely generate a hidden region without distorting the currents far from the cloaked region. The experimental results show that any object in the hidden region is invisible to a DC detector. Our cloak does not require any knowledge of the hidden object.
