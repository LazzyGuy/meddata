The condition is characterized by hypopigmentation of hair, dermis, and ocular tissue. Genetic studies have reported seven nonsyndromic OCA genes, among which Pakistani OCA families mostly segregate TYR and OCA2 gene mutations. Here in the present study, we investigate the genetic factors of eight consanguineous OCA families from Pakistan. Genetic analysis was performed through single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping (for homozygosity mapping), whole exome sequencing (for mutation identification), Sanger sequencing (for validation and segregation analysis), and quantitative PCR (qPCR) (for copy number variant [CNV] validation). Genetic mapping in one family identified a novel homozygous deletion mutation of the entire TYRP1 gene, and a novel deletion of exon 19 in the OCA2 gene in two apparently unrelated families. In three further families, we identified homozygous mutations in TYR (NM_000372.4:c.1424G > A; p.Trp475*), NM_000372.4:c.895C > T; p.Arg299Cys), and SLC45A2 (NM_016180:c.1532C > T; p.Ala511Val).

However, previous studies were limited by their retrospective nature and small patient numbers. Baseline peripheral blood leukocytes, neutrophils, hemoglobin, platelets, lactate dehydrogenase and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) were correlated with clinicopathologic characteristics, and clinical outcome in 1236 patients with rectal cancer treated with 5-FU-based preoperative chemoradiotherapy (CRT) alone or with oxaliplatin followed by surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy within the CAO/ARO/AIO-04 randomized phase 3 trial. Multivariable analyses were performed using Cox regression models. After a median follow-up of 50 months, baseline leukocytosis remained an independent adverse prognostic factor for disease-free survival (DFS; HR 1.457; 95% CI 1.163-1.825; p = 0.001), distant metastasis (HR 1.696; 95% CI 1.266-2.273; p < 0.001) and overall survival (OS; HR 1.716; 95% CI 1.264-2.329; p = 0.001) in multivariable analysis.

Conversely, treatment-induced leukopenia correlated with favorable DFS (p = 0.037), distant metastasis (p = 0.028) and OS (p = 0.012). Intriguingly, addition of oxaliplatin to 5-FU CRT resulted in a significant DFS improvement only in patients with neutrophilia and leukocytosis (p = 0.028 and p = 0.002).

Our aim was to evaluate a joint environmental-genetic risk score as a risk stratification tool for early detection of advanced colorectal neoplasm (ACRN). Known environmental risk factors and high-risk genetic loci were summarized into risk scores for ACRN in 1014 eligible participants of a screening study. The performances of single and joint environmental-genetic scores were evaluated with estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of the absolute risk, relative risk and predictive ability using the area under the curve (AUC). Individuals with higher environmental risk scores showed increasing ACRN risk, with 3.1-fold for intermediate risk and 4.8-fold for very high risk, compared to the very low environmental risk group. Similarly, individuals with higher genetic risk scores showed increasing ACRN risk, with 2.2-fold for intermediate risk and 3.5-fold for very high risk, compared to the lowest genetic risk group. Moreover, the joint environmental-genetic score improved the ACRN risk stratification and showed higher predictive values (AUC = 0.64; 95%CI = 0.60-0.67) with substantial difference (p = 0.0002) compared to the single environmental score (0.58; 0.55-0.62). The integration of environmental and genetic factors looks promising for improving targeting individuals at high-risk of colorectal neoplasm. Applications in practical screening programs require optimization with additional genetic and other biomarkers involved in colorectal carcinogenesis."

We sought to develop a scale to evaluate attitudes about the future of genomic medicine. We developed a 21-item scale that examined the likelihood of various outcomes of genomic medicine. The scale was administered to participants in a genomic sequencing study. Exploratory factor analysis was conducted and bivariate correlations were calculated. The genomic orientation (GO) scale was completed by 2895 participants. A two-factor structure was identified, corresponding to an optimism subscale (16 items, α = 0.89) and a pessimism subscale (5 items, α = 0.63). Genomic optimism was positively associated with a perceived value of genetic test results, higher health literacy, and decreased decisional conflict about participation in a genomic research study. Genomic pessimism was associated with concerns about genetic testing, lower health literacy, and increased decisional conflict about the decision to participate in the study.

Results revealed that cortisol levels between mothers and children were significantly positively correlated at pretask for dyads with mean age and older children only, at 25-min post-task for all dyads, and at 45-min post-task for all dyads. Higher overcontrol/older child dyads exhibited a unique pattern of cortisol synchrony wherein at pretask, mother-child levels had the strongest positive correlation, whereas at 25 and 45 min, mother-child cortisol levels were significantly inversely correlated.

The strength of top-down control in these trophic cascades can be affected by the identity and diversity of predators, prey, and resources, as well as environmental conditions such as temperature, moisture, and nutrient loading, which can all impact interaction strength between trophic levels. Few studies have been able to replicate a complete community over a large geographic area to compare the full trophic cascade in a manipulative experiment. Here, we identify geographic dependency in trophic cascade strength, and the driving factors and specific mechanisms behind it, by combining geographically replicated experiments with a novel approach of community analogues of common garden and transplant experiments. We studied a predator-detritivore-detritus food web in bromeliads in Puerto Rico, Costa Rica, and Brazil. We found that interaction strengths between resources, consumers, and predators were strongly site-specific, but the exact mechanism differed between trophic levels. Large bodied predators created strong interaction strengths between predator and consumer trophic levels, reducing consumer abundance regardless of the geographic location, whereas small-bodied predators created weak interactions with no impact on consumer abundances in any site. In contrast, the interaction strength between consumers and resources varied among sites, depending on the dominant species of leaf detritus. More labile leaf species in Costa Rica created a strong consumer-resource interaction and therefore strong trophic cascade, whereas tougher leaf species in Brazil created a weak consumer-resource interaction, and an overall weaker trophic cascade. Our study highlights the importance of replicating experiments over geographic scales to understand general patterns of ecological processes.",β3 -Adrenoceptors in the normal and diseased urinary bladder-What are the open questions?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30868554,British journal of pharmacology,2019 05 03,"β3 -Adrenoceptor agonists are used in the treatment of overactive bladder syndrome. Although the relaxant response to adrenergic stimulation in human detrusor smooth muscle cells is mediated mainly via β3 -adrenoceptors, the plasma concentrations of the therapeutic dose of mirabegron, the only clinically approved β3 -adrenoceptor agonist, are considerably lower than the EC50 for causing direct relaxation of human detrusor, suggesting a mechanism of action other than direct relaxation of detrusor smooth muscle. However, the site and mechanism of action of β3 -adrenoceptor agonists in the bladder have not been firmly established. Postulated mechanisms include prejunctional suppression of ACh release from the parasympathetic nerves during the storage phase and inhibition of micro-contractions through β3 -adrenoceptors on detrusor smooth muscle cells or suburothelial interstitial cells.

In this narrative review, we discuss the clinical manifestations of ITP in children and adults. ITP is asymptomatic in some patients; however, when present, bleeding is the most common symptom and can be mild as in petechiae, purpura and epistaxis, or severe and even life threatening in cases of intracranial haemorrhage, and massive gastrointestinal or urinary tract bleeding. A platelet count <10-20 × 109/L, advanced age and prior minor bleeding are risk factors for major bleeding, which is also more common in the months following a new diagnosis of acute ITP. Fatigue and impaired health-related quality of life are also manifestations of ITP that often improve with treatment and improvement in platelet counts.

However, contrasting data are available regarding its safety and efficacy. Our aim is to compare the open and MIS approaches for rectal cancer treatment. Two-hundred-thirty-seven patients were included: 113 open and 124 MIS rectal resections. After the propensity score matching analysis (PS), the cases were matched into 42 open and 42 MIS. Short- and long-term outcomes, and pathological findings were analyzed before and after PS. A further comparison of the same outcomes and costs was conducted between the laparoscopic and the robotic approaches. As a whole, a sphincter-preserving procedure was more frequently performed in the MIS group (110 vs 75 cases; p < 0.0001). The estimated blood loss during MIS was significantly lower than during open surgery [127 (± 92) vs 242 (± 122) mL; p < 0.0001], with clear advantages for the robotic approach over laparoscopy [113 (± 87) vs 147 (± 93) mL; p 0.01]. Complication rate was comparable between the two groups. A higher rate of CRM positivity was evidenced after open surgery (12.4% vs 1.7%; p 0.004). A higher number of lymph nodes was harvested in the MIS group [12.5 (± 6.4) vs 11 (± 5.6); p 0.04]. After PS, no difference in terms of perioperative outcomes was noted, with the only exception of a higher blood loss in the open approach [242 (± 122) vs 127 (± 92) mL; p < 0.0001]. For the matched cases, no difference in 5-year overall and disease-free survival was evidenced (p 0.50 and 0.88, respectively). Mean costs were higher for robotics as compared to laparoscopy [9812 (±1974)€ vs 9045 (± 1893)€; p 0.02]. MIS could be considered as a treatment option for rectal cancer. The PS study evidenced clear advantages in terms of estimated blood loss over the open surgery. Costs still remain the main limit for robotics."

The pathogenic mechanisms that lead to life-threatening heart and gut tissue disruptions occur ""silently"" for a longtime in a majority of cases. As a result, despite there are several serological and molecular methods available to diagnose the infection in its acute and chronic stages, diagnosis is often achieved only after the onset of clinical symptoms in the chronic phase of the disease. Furthermore, although there are two drugs to treat it, the assessment of their performance is impractical with current parasite-derived diagnostics, and therapeutic efficacy cannot be acknowledged in a timely manner.In this chapter we present two procedures to measure host-derived molecules as surrogates of therapeutic response against chronic T. cruzi infection. Their outputs relate to the generation and activity of thrombin, a major component of the blood coagulation cascade. This is due to the fact that a hypercoagulability state has been described to occur in chronic Chagas disease patients and revert after treatment with benznidazole.",Apolipoprotein A1 and Fibronectin Fragments as Markers of Cure for the Chagas Disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30868534,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",2019 03 29,"Chagas disease (CD), endemic from Latin America, affects more than 8 million people, and the disease keeps spreading around the world due to population migrations. The treatment options for CD are currently limited to two drugs, benznidazole (BZ) and nifurtimox (Nfx), which are often unsatisfactory in chronically infected patients. To date, the only accepted marker of the cure is seroconversion (the disappearance of Trypanosoma cruzi antibodies in the patient's serum), which can take decades to occur, if ever. The lack of posttreatment test-of-cure often prevents appropriate patient counseling and limits the development of new drugs. Without a doubt, reliable biomarkers for parasitological cure are urgently needed. Several pieces of evidence suggest that apolipoprotein A1 and fibronectin fragments are produced during the infection as part of the process of T. cruzi cell invasion and can thus be used as its surrogate biomarkers. In this chapter, we present a standardized method to evaluate these fragments in serum using mass spectrometry and immunoblotting in CD patients for diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment assessment purposes.",Analytics of Functional Autoantibodies in Patients with Chagas Disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30868533,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",2019 03 29,"Autoantibodies directed against G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR-AAB), an autoantibody type discovered in the 1970s, affect functionally their targets and are therefore called functional autoantibodies.

The method described here, termed trans-sialidase inhibition assay (TIA), enables the detection of TS-neutralizing antibodies in serum samples of different mammalian species, without the use of conjugated secondary reagents.

Herein, a protocol based on the amplification of T. cruzi SL-IRac, SL-IR I and II, 24Sα rDNA, and A10 targets by multilocus conventional PCRs is described. Following this methodology, it is possible to perform the genotyping directly from the blood and other clinical samples, without the need to isolate the parasite prior to the DNA extraction, even in a lower parasite concentration.

For years, the detection of Trypanosoma cruzi DNA by PCR has proved to be useful in some clinical scenarios like acute CD, including cases of congenital transmission, CD reactivation in immunosuppressed patients, and posttreatment follow-up. In that sense, the implementation of quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) assays was an important step in the development of more reliable tools for CD molecular diagnostics and treatment follow-up. In the last decade, two multicenter PCR studies allowed the harmonization and validation of standard operating procedures for PCR-based detection and quantification of T. cruzi DNA in blood samples. Herein we describe the two most used protocols to quantify parasitic load in human blood samples by multiplex qPCR assays and discuss some aspects to consider during planning and executing these procedures.",MicroRNA Transcriptome Profiling in Heart of Trypanosoma cruzi-Infected Mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30868529,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",2019 03 29,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small noncoding RNAs (typically 19-23 nucleotides) which act by annealing to partially complementary binding sites present on the 3' untranslated regions (UTR) of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) leading to inhibition of protein translation or by inducing mRNA decay. Since their discovery, miRNAs have come to be recognized as master regulators of gene expression in plant and mammals, controlling tissue-specific protein expression. Up to one-third of mammalian mRNAs are susceptible to miRNA-mediated regulation. It has been shown that miRNAs are determinants of the physiology and pathophysiology of the cardiovascular system, and altered expression of muscle- and/or cardiac-specific miRNAs in myocardial tissue is involved in heart development and cardiovascular diseases, including myocardial hypertrophy, heart failure, and fibrosis. The analysis of miRNA expression pattern provides important information, as well as is a starting point to understand miRNA function in different tissues, during development, and in disease. Several techniques can be used for miRNA profiling analysis like high-throughput sequencing, microarrays, and real-time PCR using microfluidic low-density arrays. This chapter describes the complete methodology to perform miRNA profiling using the stem-loop reverse-transcription (RT)-based TaqMan® MicroRNA low-density arrays (TLDA) method. This methodology was used to perform miRNA profiling in the heart of T. cruzi acutely infected mice.",Multi-Parametric Evaluation of Trypanosoma cruzi Infection Outcome in Animal Models.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30868528,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",2019 03 29,"Biomarkers of infection with consistent discriminating power for diagnosis and/or prognosis are keystones for efficient therapeutic management of diseases. The protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiologic agent of Chagas disease (CD), exhibits high clinical and genetic diversity, making it difficult to define biomarkers. In animal models of infection, as well as in patients, many different outcomes have been described. Thus, pathophysiogenesis parameters were highly variable in patients and even in inbred animals, which impeded reliable one-dimensional diagnosis/prognosis. To help solve those problems, an in-depth analysis of the similarities and differences in the CD caused by different parasite strains or different patient conditions is needed. Multidimensional statistics may overcome the high variability for each individual parameter in patients and even in inbred animals, revealing some pathophysiological patterns that accurately allow diagnosis of clinical and physiopathological characteristics. Here, we describe this type of method and its application to T. cruzi infection.",In Situ Detection of Dormant Trypanosoma cruzi Amastigotes Using Bioluminescent-Fluorescent Reporters.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30868527,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",2019 03 29,"Chagas disease agent, Trypanosoma cruzi, is capable to persist after prolonged drug treatment using effective drugs. The reason of treatment failure is not known, but recent development of highly sensible bioluminescence imaging coupled to tissue clarification techniques has made possible the detection of individual amastigotes within chronically infected murine tissues and the study of their replicative status. In this chapter, we provide a step-by-step explanation for these protocols that allowed the visualization of nonproliferating amastigotes in tissues of chronically infected mice for the first time.",Transmigration of Trypanosoma cruzi Trypomastigotes through 3D Spheroids Mimicking Host Tissues.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30868526,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",2019 03 29,"While cellular invasion by T. cruzi trypomastigotes and intracellular amastigote replication are well-characterized events that have been described by using 2D monolayer cultures, other relevant parasite-host interactions, like the dynamics of tissue invasiveness, cannot be captured using monolayer cultures. Spheroids constitute a valuable three-dimensional (3D) culture system because they mimic the microarchitecture of tissues and provide an environment similar to the encountered in natural infections, which includes the presence of extracellular matrix as well as 3D cell-cell interactions. In this work, we describe a protocol for studying transmigration of T. cruzi trypomastigotes into 3D spheroids. In the experimental setup, cells and parasites are labelled with two fluorescent dyes, allowing their visualization by confocal microscopy. We also describe the general procedure and setting of the confocal microscope and downstream applications for acquisition and reconstruction of 3D images. This model was employed to analyze the transmigration of trypomastigotes from the highly virulent and pantropic RA T. cruzi strain. Of course, other aspects encountered by T. cruzi in the mammalian host environment can be studied with this methodology."

Among its features are 600-kb-long repetitive multigene families' clusters, hybrid strains, and aneuploidies, which hampered genome assembly completeness and contiguity. Several approaches, such as Sanger sequencing in 2005, next-generation sequencing in 2011 and third-generation sequencing in 2018, were used to improve draft assemblies of different strains of this parasite. Hence, the study of T. cruzi genome assemblies' history is an excellent way to describe the evolution of genome sequencing methodologies and compare their efficiency and limitations to assembly complex genomes.

Gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel (GnP) has been widely accepted as systemic chemotherapy for unresectable pancreatic cancer and reportedly results in remarkable tumor shrinkage. This study was performed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of neoadjuvant chemotherapy using neoadjuvant GnP for BRPC.,Defining Tumor Rupture in Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30868512,Annals of surgical oncology,2019 06 10,"Tumor rupture is an important risk factor predictive of recurrence after macroscopically complete resection of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs), and an indication for defined interval or even lifelong adjuvant therapy with imatinib according to guidelines. However, there is no consensus or universally accepted definition of the term 'tumor rupture', and, consequently, its incidence varies greatly across reported series. Without predefined criteria, the clinical significance of rupture has also been difficult to assess on multivariate analysis of retrospective data. We reviewed the relevant literature and international guidelines, and, based on the Oslo criteria, proposed the following six definitions for 'tumor rupture': (1) tumor fracture or spillage; (2) blood-stained ascites; (3) gastrointestinal perforation at the tumor site; (4) microscopic infiltration of an adjacent organ; (5) intralesional dissection or piecemeal resection; or (6) incisional biopsy. Not all minor defects of tumor integrity should not be classified as rupture, i.e. mucosal defects or spillage contained within the gastrointestinal lumen, microscopic tumor penetration of the peritoneum or iatrogenic damage only to the peritoneal lining, uncomplicated transperitoneal needle biopsy, and R1 resection. This broad definition identifies GIST patients at particularly high risk of recurrence in population-based cohorts; however, its applicability in other sarcomas has not been investigated. As the proposed definition of tumor rupture in GIST has limited evidence based on the small number of patients with rupture in each retrospective study, we recommend validating the proposed definition of tumor rupture in GIST in prospective studies and considering it in clinical practice.",Melatonin induces reactive oxygen species generation and changes in glutathione levels and reduces viability in human pancreatic stellate cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30868511,Journal of physiology and biochemistry,2019 03 14,"In this study, the effects of pharmacological concentrations of melatonin (1 μM-1 mM) on human pancreatic stellate cells (HPSCs) have been examined. Cell type-specific markers and expression of melatonin receptors were analyzed by western blot analysis. Changes in intracellular free Ca2+ concentration were followed by fluorimetric analysis of fura-2-loaded cells. Reduced glutathione (GSH) and oxidized glutathione (GSSG) levels were determined by fluorescence techniques. Production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was monitored following 5-(and-6)-chloromethyl-2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate acetyl ester and MitoSOX™ Red-derived fluorescence. Cell viability was studied using the AlamarBlue® test. Cultured cells expressed markers typical of stellate cells. However, cell membrane receptors for melatonin could not be detected. Thapsigargin, bradykinin, or melatonin induced changes in intracellular free Ca2+ concentration. In the presence of the indole, a decrease in the GSH/GSSG ratio was observed that depended on the concentration of melatonin used. Furthermore, the indole evoked a concentration-dependent increase in ROS production in the mitochondria and in the cytosol. Finally, melatonin decreased HPSC viability in a time and concentration-dependent manner. We conclude that melatonin, at pharmacological concentrations, induces changes in the oxidative state of HPSC. This might regulate cellular viability and could not involve specific plasma membrane receptors.",Plasma lactate and leukocyte mitochondrial DNA copy number as biomarkers of insulin sensitivity in non-diabetic women.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30868510,Journal of physiology and biochemistry,2019 03 14,"High plasma lactate levels have been associated with reduced mitochondrial respiratory capacity and increased type 2 diabetes risk, while mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number has been proposed as a biomarker of mitochondrial function linked to glucose homeostasis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between circulating lactate levels and leukocyte mtDNA copy numbers with insulin secretion/sensitivity indexes in 65 Chilean non-diabetic women. mtDNA copy numbers were measured in leukocytes using qPCR and digital-droplet PCR. A 75-g Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) was performed to calculate systemic and tissue-specific insulin sensitivity indexes, as well as insulin secretion surrogates based on plasma c-peptide. An intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT; 0.3 g/kg) was also carried out. Disposition indexes were calculated as the product of insulin secretion × sensitivity. Plasma levels of leptin, adiponectin, TNF-α, MCP-1, and non-esterified fatty acids were also determined. Fasting plasma lactate shows a significant association with a wide range of insulin sensitivity/resistance indexes based on fasting plasma samples (HOMA-S, adipose IR index, Revised-QUICKI, leptin-adiponectin ratio, TyG index, McAuley index and TG-to-HDL-C ratio), as well as OGTT-based measures such as the Matsuda index, the hepatic insulin resistance index, and the disposition index. Fasting plasma lactate was also positively associated with the circulating adipokines TNF-α and MCP-1. We also detected a direct association between fasting plasma lactate with leukocyte mtDNA copy numbers. The above results support the use of fasting plasma lactate, and possibly leukocyte mtDNA copy numbers, as biomarkers of reduced oxidative mitochondrial capacity, decreased hepatic insulin sensitivity, and future diabetes risk.",Protective effect of surface-modified berberine nanoparticles against LPS-induced neurodegenerative changes: a preclinical study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30868509,Drug delivery and translational research,2019 03 14,"Berberine (BBR) exerts documented protection against neurodegenerative disorders. However, data on the effect of nano-encapsulation on the neuroprotective effect of BBR are lacking. We investigated the effect of BBR loading into chitosan (CS) nanoparticles (NPs) and their surface modification with Tween 80 (T80), polyethylene glycol 4000 (PEG), and miltefosine (MFS) against lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced neurodegenerative changes in addition to hepatotoxicity in rats. BBR-NPs were prepared by ionic gelation and characterized for morphology by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), colloidal properties, and entrapment efficiency (EE%). The neuroprotective and hepatoprotective effects of a 14-day pretreatment with four BBR-NPs formulations (4 mg/kg BBR/day) by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection were challenged by a single i.p. 4 mg/kg dose of LPS on the fifteenth day. Neuroprotective efficacy and potential toxicity of BBR-NPs relative to BBR solution were assessed biochemically and histopathologically. One-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's comparison test was used for statistical analysis. CS nano-encapsulation and surface modification of BBR-NPs altered the neuroprotective and hepatoprotective effects of BBR depending on the physicochemical and/or biological effects of BBR, CS, coating materials, and NP-related features. Similar to the prophylactic and treatment efficacy of NPs for brain delivery, safety of these nanostructures and their individual formulation components warrants due research attention.",Improvement of Mechanical Stability for Single Unit Recording Based on Skull Cap in Living Chinchilla.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30868508,Current medical science,2019 03 29,"Three-point head fixation was constructed to provide mechanical stability for single unit recording (SUR) on vestibular sensory system in living chinchilla previously. However, it is no more qualified to this work when the stimulation intensity becomes large because of frequent unit losing and neuron damage, which strongly implies that the mechanical stability has been broken during the stimulation. Here, we constructed a novel head fixation (skull cap assistant head fixation) provided by skull cap on the basis of three-point head fixation in order to improve the mechanical stability for SUR under the stimulation with large magnitude. The large area bone connection is the feature and advantage of this improved method, which directly fixes the tested local nervous tissue and microelectrode in an intact stable system through skull cap except two ear bars and a tube face mask. Our data exhibited that skull cap assistant head fixation could significantly improve the success rate of neural response activity recording in the population of semicircular canal neurons under the stimulation with large intensity (amplitude ≥100 deg/s). Based on the analysis of neural response activity and noise base-line during stimulation, our data further indicated that this method could significantly improve the mechanical stability for SUR during high-speed motion stimulation on vestibular system in living chinchilla. Skull cap assistant head fixation extends the application of SUR on vestibular neuron in linear response range and provides a solid foundation for electrophysiological research on vestibular sensory system in further studies.",Preparation of Molecularly Imprinted Composites Initiated by Hemin/Graphene Hybrid Nanosheets and Its Application in Detection of Sulfamethoxazole.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30868507,Current medical science,2019 03 29,"Molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) exhibit high selectivity resulting from imprinted cavities and superior performance from functional materials, which have attracted much attention in many fields. However, the combination of MIPs film and functional materials is a great challenge. In this study, hemin/graphene hybrid nanosheets (H-GNs) were used to initiate the imprinted polymerization by catalyzing the generation of free radicals. Thus, MIPs using sulfamethoxazole as the template was directly prepared on the surface of H-GNs without any film modification. Most importantly, the template could be absorbed on the H-GNs to enhance the number of imprinted sites per unit surface area, which could improve the selectivity of MIPs film. Thus, the composites could exhibit high adsorption capacity (29.4 mg/g), imprinting factor (4.2) and excellent conductivity, which were modified on the surface of electrode for rapid, selective and sensitive detection of sulfamethoxazole in food and serum samples. The linear range was changed from 5 μg/kg to 1 mg/g and the limit of detection was 1.2 μg/kg. This sensor was free from interference caused by analogues of sulfamethoxazole, which provides a novel insight for the preparation of MIPs-based sensor and its application in food safety monitoring and human exposure study.",Model of Healthcare-Associated Infection Control in Primary Health Care Institutions: A Structural Equation Modeling.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30868506,Current medical science,2019 03 29,"The purpose of this study was to construct the model of organization system, management, training and surveillance in healthcare-associated infection prevention and control (IC) of primary health care institutions and identify its effect on patient safety and decreasing economic burden by standardizing IC. A cross-sectional survey was conducted with questionnaires. Data were collected from 268 primary health care institutions in Hubei province, China. Hypotheses on the model of IC were analyzed by means of confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modeling. The results showed that the fit indices of the hypothesized model of IC satisfied recommended levels: root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA)=0.071; comparative fit index (CFI)=0.965; tucker-lewis index (TLI)=0.956; weighted root mean square residual (WRMR)=1.014. The model showed that organization system had a direct effect on management (β=0.311, P<0.01), and training (β=0.365, P<0.01). Management and training played an intermediary role that partially promoted organization system impact on surveillance. Results also showed that institutional factors such as the number of physicians, the number of nurses, the designated capacity of beds, the actual number of open beds and surgery trips had positive impacts on management (β=0.050, P<0.01; β=0.181, P<0.01; β=0.111, P<0.01; β=0.064, P<0.01; β=0.084, P=0.04) and training (β=0.21, P=0.03; β=0.050, P=0.02; β=0.586, P=0.01; β=-0.995, P=0.02; β=-0.223, P=0.03).

We retrospectively analyzed 45 patients of colorectal diseases who underwent definition AS+128-slice spiral CT combined with virtual colonoscopy after bowel preparation and gas injection to evaluate the clinical diagnostic value of this technology. All the patients received electronic colonoscopy and were confirmed by pathology. In total, colorectal cancer was confirmed in 42 cases and inflammation in 3 cases. Diagnostic results shows: there were 17 cases of lump, 10 cases of infiltration, 6 cases of ulcer, 9 cases of mixed type, 4 cases of liver metastases, and 36 cases of lymph node metastasis. There was no significant difference between 128-slice spiral CT combined with virtual colonoscopy and electronic colonoscopy in detection, localization and characterization of colorectal tumors. CT virtual endoscopy has great advantages in observing the invasion around the lesion and the presence or absence of metastasis in distant organs and lymph node metastasis. It is also possible to understand the shape of the lesion in the intestinal lumen and the length of the lesion involving the lumen of the intestine."

Apoptosis of osteoblasts is considered as the main reason of ONFH at the molecular level. Glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) is an important regulator of cellular differentiation and apoptosis pathway, which can modulate the balance between osteoblasts and osteoclasts. Several studies have reported about its function in osteoporosis, but little is known about it in osteonecrosis. In our study, lipopolysaccharide and methylprednisolone were utilized to establish a rat ONFH model. The phosphorylation of GSK3β Ser-9 was decreased in the model. Western blotting examination of β-catenin, Bcl-2, Bax and caspase-3 revealed that the osteoblasts were apoptotic. In dexamethasone (Dex)-incubated primary osteoblasts, the expression profile of GSK3β phosphorylation and apoptotic factors were consistent with those in the rat ONFH model. To further investigate the regulation of osteonecrosis caused by GSK3β, the expression and function of GSK3β were inhibited in Dex-incubated primary osteoblasts. The knockdown of GSK3β by siRNA decreased the expression of Bax and cleaved caspase-3, but increased Bcl-2 and β-catenin. On the other hand, selective inhibition of GSK3β function by LiCl counteracted the activation of caspase-3 induced by Dex. Our work is the first study about the GSK3β phosphorylation in ONFH, and provides evidence for further therapeutic methods.",Age-related Changes in the Global DNA Methylation Profile of Oligodendrocyte Progenitor Cells Derived from Rat Spinal Cords.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30868493,Current medical science,2019 03 29,"Demyelination of axons plays an important role in the pathology of many spinal cord diseases and injuries. Remyelination in demyelinated lesions is primarily performed by oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs), which generate oligodendrocytes in the developing and mature central nervous system. The efficiency of remyelination decreases with age. Many reports suggest that this decline in remyelination results from impaired OPC recruitment and differentiation during aging. Of the various molecular mechanisms involved in aging, changes in epigenetic modifications have received particular attention. Global DNA methylation is a major epigenetic modification that plays important roles in cellular senescence and organismal aging. Thus, we aimed to evaluate the dynamic changes in the global DNA methylation profiles of OPCs derived from rat spinal cords during the aging process. We separated and cultured OPCs from the spinal cords of neonatal, 4-month-old, and 16-month-old rats and investigated the age-related alterations of genomic DNA methylation levels by using quantitative colorimetric analysis. To determine the potential cause of dynamic changes in global DNA methylation, we further analyzed the activity of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) and the expression of DNMT1, DNMT3a, DNMT3b, TET1, TET2, TET3, MBD2, and MeCP2 in the OPCs from each group. Our results showed the genomic DNA methylation level and the activity of DNMTs from OPCs derived from rat spinal cords decreased gradually during aging, and OPCs from 16-month-old rats were characterized by global hypomethylation. During OPC aging, the mRNA and protein expression levels of DNMT3a, DNMT3b, and MeCP2 were significantly elevated; those of DNMT1 were significantly down-regulated; and no significant changes were observed in those for TET1, TET2, TET3, or MBD2. Our results indicated that global DNA hypomethylation in aged OPCs is correlated with DNMT1 downregulation. Together, these data provide important evidence for partly elucidating the mechanism of age-related impaired OPC recruitment and differentiation and assist in the development of new treatments for promoting efficient remyelination.",Muscle Fiber Type Changes in Lumbrical Muscles at Early Stages of Chronic Nerve Compression.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30868492,Current medical science,2019 03 29,"Chronic nerve compression (CNC) neuropathy is a common disease in the clinic and provokes paraesthesia, or numbness at early stage. The changes in muscle fiber composition and motor nerve terminal morphology in distal muscles were studied in this study. A well-established CNC model was used to assess the changes in the muscles. Behaviors were measured by von Frey filament test. The myosin heavy chain isoforms and neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) were stained by immunofluorescence to show the muscle fiber types composition and motor nerve terminals morphologic changes in the flexor digitorum longus (FDL) and lumbrical muscle. The fiber cross-sectional areas of different muscle fiber types were measured. The small-fiber degeneration of cutaneous nerve fibers was examined by detecting the protein gene product 9.5 (PGP9.5) with immunofluorescence. At 2nd month after compression, the proportion of type I and type II B fibers was markedly decreased, and that of type II A fibers was increased in the lumbrical muscle. There was no significant change in composition of muscle fiber types in FDL and NMJ morphology of FDL and lumbrical muscles. Intra-epidermal nerve fibre density (IENFD) declined at 2nd month after the compression. Our study reveals the morphological changes of the FDL and lumbrical muscle at an early stage of CNC. These findings may be helpful to understand muscle damage and pathophysiological development of the nerve compression, and provide new evidence for early treatment of CNC.",Continuous Positive Airway Pressure Effectively Alleviates Arrhythmias in Patients with Obstructive Sleep Apnea: Possible Relationship with Counteracting Oxidative Stress.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30868491,Current medical science,2019 03 29,"This work is aimed at exploring the clinical efficacy of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) in treatment of patients with arrhythmias combined with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Through evaluating serum native thiol, malonaldehyde (MDA) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase (NADPH oxidase) in these patients and describing the effects on oxidative parameters of CPAP therapy for 3 months, we confirmed the impact of oxidative stress on arrhythmias. A total of 64 patients with OSA combined with arrhythmias were collected from April 2014 to April 2017 with full clinical information. Patients were divided into two groups (paired experiment design): 32 patients in group A (control group), who received unchanged anti-arrhythmia treatment and 32 patients in group B, who were subjected to unchanged pharmacological anti-arrhythmia therapy combined with CPAP. OSA related parameters were compared between the two groups after 3-month therapy. And the levels of parameters of oxidative stress in patients were measured before and after CPAP therapy. After 3 months of CPAP therapy, compared with the control group, the percentage of sage N3 (NREM 3) and stage R (REM) in total sleep time was significantly increased, while apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) score were evidently decreased. Meanwhile, the lowest oxygen saturation (LSpO2) was also elevated after CPAP treatment for 3 months. The CPAP therapy significantly prevented the occurrence of arrhythmias (P<0.05). Both the MDA level and NADPH oxidase levels were significantly lower in the group B than in the group A (P<0.05). But serum native thiol was improved by CPAP treatment (P<0.05). In conclusion, proper use of CPAP therapy provides significant benefits for the treatment of arrhythmia in patients with OSA.",Association between CYP2C19*2/*3 Polymorphisms and Coronary Heart Disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30868490,Current medical science,2019 03 29,"This study sought to explore the relationship between cytochrome P450 2C19 (CYP2C19) *2/*3 polymorphisms and the development of coronary heart disease (CHD), and to evaluate the influence of the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on the occurrence of adverse clinical events in CHD patients. A total of 231 consecutive patients candidate for percutaneous coronary intervention genotyped for CYP2C19*2 (681G>A) and *3 (636G>A) polymorphisms were enrolled. The adverse clinical events were recorded during a follow-up period of 14 months. The incidence of CHD, according to coronary angiography, was significantly higher (P=0.025) in CYP2C19*2 carriers group. Stepwise binary logistic regression analysis revealed that among factors that potentially influenced the presence of CHD (age>60 years, gender, BMI, etc.), CYP2C19*2 carriers (OR 1.94, 95% CI: 1.08-3.50, P=0.028) and male gender (OR 2.74, 95% CI: 1.58-4.76, P=0.001) were independent predictors, which were associated with the presence of CHD. The follow-up results showed that the incidence of adverse cardiovascular events within 14 months of discharge was significantly higher in the CYP2C19*2 carriers than in the non-carriers (21.6% vs. 6.3%, P=0.019). The results of the multivariate Cox proportional hazards model showed that CYP2C19*2 loss-of-function was the only independent factor which predicted the coronary events during the follow-up period of 14 months (OR=3.65, 95% CI 1.09-12.25, P=0.036). The adverse impact of CYP2C19*2 polymorphisms was found not only in the risk of the presence of CHD, but also in the adverse cardiovascular events in CHD patients during the follow-up period of 14 months. However the same influence was not found in CYP2C19*3 mutation in Chinese Han population.",Berberine Ameliorates High-Fat Diet-Induced Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease in Rats via Activation of SIRT3/AMPK/ACC Pathway.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30868489,Current medical science,2019 03 29,"This study aimed to verify the effects of berberine (BBR) on the fat metabolism proteins involved in the sirtuin 3 (SIRT3)/adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) pathway in the liver tissues of rats with high-fat diet (HFD)-induced non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Forty-eight rats were randomly divided into the normal control (NC) group, HFD group or BBR group, with 16 rats in each group. After 8 and 16 weeks of treatment, serum and liver samples were collected. Subsequently, body parameters, biochemical parameters and liver pathology were examined. The expression levels of proteins involved in the SIRT3/AMPK/ACC pathway in the liver were detected by Western blotting. After 8 and 16 weeks of a HFD, the successful establishment of rat models with different degrees of NAFLD was confirmed by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and Oil Red O staining. NAFLD rat models exhibited obesity and hyperlipidemia, and the protein expression levels of SIRT3, p-AMPK, p-ACC, and CPT-1A in the liver were significantly decreased compared to those in the NC group. The concurrent administration of BBR with the HFD effectively improved serum and liver lipid profiles and ameliorated liver injury. Furthermore, the protein expression levels of SIRT3, p-AMPK, p-ACC, and CPT-1A in the liver were significantly increased in the BBR group as compared with those in the HFD group. In conclusion, our data suggest that the mechanism by which BBR ameliorates HFD-induced hepatic steatosis may be related to the activation of the SIRT3/AMPK/ACC pathway in the liver.",Role of Wnt/β-Catenin Pathway in the Arterial Medial Calcification and Its Effect on the OPG/RANKL System.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30868488,Current medical science,2019 03 29,"In this study, the hypothesis that Wnt/β-catenin pathway is involved in the arterial calcification by regulating the osteoprotegerin (OPG)/receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL) system was tested. The β-catenin expression was measured in the warfarin-induced calcified arteries and the osteoblast-like cells differentiating from smooth muscle cells (SMCs) by immunohistochemistry and Western blotting. The Wnt/β-catenin pathway was activated or inhibited by lithium chloride (LiCl) or dickkopf 1 (DKK1) in vitro and in vivo. Then the calcification level was determined by von Kossa staining, Ca2+ content assay, and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity assay. The expression levels of osteocalcin, OPG and RANKL were detected by Western blotting or real-time PCR. The results showed that in calcified arteries and OBL cells, the activation of Wnt/β-catenin pathway significantly enhanced the calcification as evidenced by increased von Kossa stains, Ca2+ contents, ALP activities, and osteocalcin expression levels (P<0.05), and it promoted the RANKL expression (P<0.05), but slightly affected the OPG expression. These results indicated that the activation of Wnt/β-catenin pathway worsens the arterial calcification, probably by promoting the RANKL expression.",Long Term Perinatal Deltamethrin Exposure Alters Electrophysiological Properties of Embryonic Ventricular Cardiomyocyte.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30868487,Current medical science,2019 03 29,"Increased use of pyrethroids and the exposure to pyrethroids for pregnant women and children have raised the concerns over the potential effect of pyrethroids on developmental cardiotoxicity and other abnormalities. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether long term perinatal deltamethrin exposure altered embryonic cardiac electrophysiology in mice. Pregnant mice were administered with 0 or 3 mg/kg of deltamethrin by gavage daily from gestational day (gd) 10.5 to gd 17. 5. Whole cell patch-clamp technique was used in electrophysiological study, and real time RT-PCR was applied to analyze the molecular changes for the electrophysiological properties. Deltamethrin exposure resulted in increased mortality of pregnant mice and decreased viability of embryos. Moreover, deltamethrin slowed the maximum depolarization velocity (Vmax), prolonged the action potential duration (APD) and depolarized the maximum diastolic potential (MDP) of embryonic cardiomyocytes. Additionally, perinatal deltamethrin exposure decreased the mRNA expression of Na+ channel regulatory subunit Navβ1, inward rectifier K+ channel subunit Kir2.1, and delayed rectifier K+ channel subunit MERG while the L-type Ca2+ channel subunit, Cav1.2 expression was increased. On the contrary, deltamethrin administration did not significantly alter the regulation of β-adrenergic or muscarinic receptor on embryonic cardiomyocytes. In conclusion, deltamethrin exposure at perinatal stage significantly alters mRNA expression of embryonic cardiac ion channels and therefore influences embryonic cardiac electrophysiological properties. This highlights the need to understand the persistent effects of pyrethroid exposure on cardiac function during embryonic development due to potential for cardiac arrhythmogenicity.",Kartogenin and Its Application in Regenerative Medicine.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30868486,Current medical science,2019 03 29,"Regenerative medicine refers to the possibility of replacing aged/damaged cells with genetically similar young and functional cells to restore or establish normal function. Kartogenin (KGN), a small heterocyclic, drug-like compound was discovered in 2012, which is strongly associated with regenerative medicine. KGN has been applied in many regenerative fields, including cartilage regeneration and protection, tendon-bone healing, wound healing, and limb development. KGN could facilitate cartilage repair, promote formation of cartilage-like transition zone in tendon-bone junctions, stimulate collagen synthesis for wound healing, and regulate limb development in a coordinated manner. Considering the related mechanism, filamin A/CBFβ/RUNX1, Ihh, and TGFβ/Smad pathways have been reported to involve KGN. Therefore, KGN is proven a promising agent in regenerative medicine; however, studies conducted on the effect of KGN are limited to date and not convictive for long-term use. Further studies are recommended to explore the long-term effect and potential molecular mechanisms of KGN. Our investigations may motivate researchers to expand its applications in different forms and fields.",Application of Finite Element Analysis for Investigation of Intervertebral Disc Degeneration: from Laboratory to Clinic.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30868485,Current medical science,2019 03 29,"Due to the ethical concern and inability to detect inner stress distributions of intervertebral disc (IVD), traditional methods for investigation of intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD) have significant limitations. Many researchers have demonstrated that finite element analysis (FEA) is an effective tool for the research of IVDD. However, the specific application of FEA for investigation of IVDD has not been systematically elucidated before. In the present review, we summarize the current finite element models (FEM) used for the investigation of IVDD, including the poroelastic nonlinear FEM, diffusive-reactive theory model and cell-activity coupled mechano-electrochemical theory model. We further elaborate the use of FEA for the research of IVDD pathogenesis especially for nutrition and biomechanics associated etiology, and the biological, biomechanical and clinical influences of IVDD. In addition, the application of FEA for evaluation and exploration of various treatments for IVDD is also elucidated. We conclude that FEA is an excellent technique for research of IVDD, which could be used to explore the etiology, biology and biomechanics of IVDD. In the future, FEA may help us to achieve the goal of individualized precision therapy."

Revisiting the Cross-Generational Relationship Over the Last Century.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30868472,Demography,2019 04 18,"In most developed countries, the fertility levels of parents and children are positively correlated. This article analyzes the strength of the intergenerational transmission of family size over the last century, including a focus on this reproduction in large and small families. Using the large-scale French Family Survey (2011), we show a weak but significant correlation of approximately 0.12-0.15, which is comparable with levels in other Western countries. It is stronger for women than men, with a gender convergence across cohorts. A decrease in intergenerational transmission is observed across birth cohorts regardless of whether socioeconomic factors are controlled, supporting the idea that the family of origin has lost implicit and explicit influence on fertility choices. As parents were adopting the two-child family norm, the number of siblings lost its importance for having two children, but it continues to explain lower parity and, above all, three-child families. This suggests that the third child has increasingly become an ""extra child"" (beyond the norm) favored by people from large families.",Clinical Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Considerations in the (Modern) Treatment of Melanoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30868471,Clinical pharmacokinetics,2019 03 14,"Targeted therapies, based on identification of common oncogenic mutations such as BRAF V600E/K and monoclonal antibody immunotherapies, have transformed the treatment of melanoma.

Monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab and nivolumab, against programmed cell death protein (PD-1) on T cells, as well as ipilimumab against cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4), enable restoration of suppressed T-cell antitumour response, and have also shown improved clinical benefit compared with traditional chemotherapy. Exploration of different combination therapies, sequence of treatment, and dosing strategies is ongoing, and the understanding of the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of these new agents is fundamental in devising the optimal regimen. Preclinical and clinical studies, as well as population PK modelling, provide essential data in terms of PK parameters, metabolism, interpatient variability, drug interactions and PD effects at the target. This review gathers the current evidence and understanding of the clinical PK and PD of drugs used in the modern treatment of melanoma, and the factors determining drug disposition, exposure and clinical response, and also highlighting areas of further research.",Invited Commentary on Preventive Anti-Migraine Therapy (PAMT).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30868470,Current treatment options in neurology,2019 04 17,"Migraine is a chronic paroxysmal neurological disorder characterized by multiphase attacks of head pain and a myriad of neurological symptoms. Chronic migraine causes a great personal and societal burden. Many patients are poorly responsive to, or non-compliant with, conventional migraine preventive therapies. For this reason, physicians are constantly looking for effective migraine prevention strategies. The recent introduction of an innovative pharmacological class useful for migraine prevention, namely monoclonal antibodies towards calcitonin gene-related peptide or its receptors, opens a new, immense therapeutic scenario. In this commentary, the development and efficacy of this novel class of preventive anti-migraine therapy have been discussed and compared with the conventional therapies of migraine prevention.",Efficacy of Therapeutic Plasma Exchange in Patients with Severe Refractory Anti-NMDA Receptor Encephalitis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30868469,Neurotherapeutics : the journal of the American Society for Experimental NeuroTherapeutics,2019 03 14,"The objective of the present study was to assess the efficacy of therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) in patients with severe refractory anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate (anti-NMDA) receptor encephalitis. Patients with severe anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis who showed no improvement after steroids and/or intravenous immunoglobulin treatment for at least 10 days were enrolled. All patients received immunotherapy and were divided into a TPE group and a non-TPE group according to treatment received. Each patient in the TPE group received at least 1 TPE course. NMDA receptor antibody titers in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma were evaluated within 1 week after the last TPE procedure. The clinical efficacy of treatment was evaluated after 1 month, 2 months, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months. Forty patients were enrolled: 19 in the TPE group and 21 in the non-TPE group. Nineteen patients received TPE for a total of 118 procedures. NMDA receptor antibody titers in the CSF and/or plasma decreased or were negative after the last TPE procedure in 18 patients (94.7%). Compared with the non-TPE group, the TPE group exhibited greater clinical improvement after 1 month and 2 months following treatment (P < 0.05). After 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months, there were no significant differences in the outcomes between the TPE group and non-TPE group. The results suggest that TPE might rapidly improve the clinical manifestations in patients with severe refractory anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis, and we believe that TPE should be considered as a first-line treatment.",The current and emerging therapeutic approaches in drug-resistant epilepsy management.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30868468,Acta neurologica Belgica,2019 05 25,"Epilepsy is a neurologic disorder consisting of recurrent spontaneous seizures. Antiepileptic drugs administration is the most commonly used therapeutic strategy in the management of epilepsy. However, 20-30% of epilepsy patients have seizure episodes that are not controlled by these medicines (drug-resistant epilepsy). The management of drug-resistant epilepsy, especially in the children, is challenging and can cause economic and social problems, and lower the patients' quality of life, cognition, and mood. Several therapeutic approaches for drug-resistant epilepsy are available including surgical methods, neurostimulation treatments, and diet therapies which lead to diminishing the epileptic seizures. An increasing number of novel and potential therapeutic approaches such as gene therapy, gene editing, cell therapy, exosome therapy, and molecular network targeting have also been explored.

Three patients with headaches with or without intraparenchymal hemorrhage that were highly suspected to have CVST, despite inconclusive anatomical imaging, were selected for inclusion in the study. Platelets were extracted by two rounds of centrifugation from 49 ml of the patient's whole blood. The platelets were labeled with 99mTc-HMPAO and any unbound 99mTc was removed by centrifugation. The re-suspension of 99mTc-HMPAO-labeled platelets in cell-free plasma was reinjected into the patients. After 2 h, planar and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) images of the head were obtained. Extensive clots were detected in all three patients, illustrated in the planar image and even clearer in the SPECT images. We propose that 99mTc-HMPAO-labeled platelet scan is a favorable imaging method for patients suspected to have CVST with inconclusive CT and MRI results.",Treatment of wastewater from petroleum industry: current practices and perspectives.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30868465,Environmental science and pollution research international,2019 03 14,"Petroleum industry is one of the fastest growing industries, and it significantly contributes to economic growth in developing countries like India.

All these compounds are present as very complex form in discharged water of petroleum industry, which are harmful for environment directly or indirectly. Some of the techniques used to treat oily waste/wastewater are membrane technology, photocatalytic degradation, advanced oxidation process, electrochemical catalysis, etc. In this review paper, we aim to discuss past and present scenario of using various treatment technologies for treatment of petroleum industry waste/wastewater.

Particularly, FMBO-mediated transformation mechanisms of SMX were explored using radical scavengers and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR). Results indicated that the best removal efficiency was obtained at a pH of 4.0, with the H2O2 of 6.0 mmol/L and the FMBO dosage of 2.0 g/L, giving 97.6% removal of 10 mg/L SMX within 60 min. More importantly, we found that the hydroxyl (•OH) radicals generated by FMBO through Fenton-like reaction were responsible for the SMX oxidation. EPR studies were confirmed that the peak intensities of hydroxyl adduct decreased remarkably with increasing pH values. Moreover, the four SMX degradation intermediate products were detected by LC/MS and a reaction pathway for the possible mineralization of SMX, with •OH radicals as the main oxidant, was proposed. These findings provide a novel insight into the removal of SMX by FMBO-mediated radical reactions in aquatic environments. Moreover, this research suggested that FMBO can act as an efficient catalyst to remove SMX in hospital wastewater."

A systematic database search identified 22 qualitative papers addressing barriers to accessing sexual healthcare services for TMSW. These papers were critically evaluated for adherence to best practice standards for qualitative research and research with sex workers. A coding process identified five themes. Stigma was the predominant barrier, and was divided into stigma related to sexuality, gender identity, HIV status, sex worker status, and internalised stigma. Other barriers were confidentiality concerns, sexual health literacy, fatalism, and structural barriers. Each of these themes were informed by the wider context of stigma.

Though many aggregation inhibitors of misfolded amyloid beta (Aβ42) peptide have failed in clinical trials, there are some positive aspects of the designed therapeutic peptides for diseases involving proteinaceous aggregation. Here, we evaluated a smart design of side chain tripeptide (Leu-Val-Phe)-based polymeric inhibitor addressing the fundamental hydrophobic amino acid stretch ""Lys-Leu-Val-Phe-Phe-Ala"" (KLVFFA) of the Aβ42 peptide. The in vitro analyses performed through the thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence assay, infrared spectroscopy, isothermal calorimetry, cytotoxicity experiments, and so on evinced a promising path towards the development of new age AD therapeutics targeting the inhibition of misfolded Aβ42 peptide fibrillization. The in silico simulations done contoured the mechanism of drug action of the present block copolymer as the competitive inhibition of aggregate-prone hydrophobic stretch of Aβ42. Graphical abstract The production of misfolded Aβ42 peptide from amyloid precursor protein initiates amyloidosis pathway which ends with the deposition of fibrils via the oligomerization and aggregation of Aβ42 monomers. The side chain tripeptide-based PEGylated polymer targets these Aβ42 monomers and oligomers inhibiting their aggregation.

This report was designed to evaluate the influential role of levothyroxine (L-T4) replacement therapy on circulating levels of UA in patients with recent onset post-thyroidectomy subclinical hypothyroidism. Circulating levels of thyroid hormones, UA and other metabolic parameters were assessed in 155 recently thyroidectomized patients (131 females, mean age 51.1 ± 12.7 years) at baseline (5-7 day after surgery) and after 2 months under replacement therapy with L-T4. At baseline, circulating levels of thyroid hormones were indicative of a subclinical hypothyroidism (TSH 8.2 ± 5.1 mU/mL, FT3 2.1 ± 0.7 pg/mL, FT4 9.2 ± 3.4 pg/mL). The mean serum UA concentration was 5.0 ± 1.3 mg/dL, while the prevalence of hyperuricemia, defined by serum UA levels > 6 mg/dL, was 22.6%. Serum UA levels at baseline were significantly correlated with HOMA-IR index (r = 0.475, p < 0.0001). After 2 months under the replacement therapy with L-T4, both serum UA levels (- 1.2 ± 0.9 mg/dL, p < 0.0001 vs. baseline) and HOMA-IR (- 0.3 ± 1.5 mmol/L, p = 0.0328 vs. baseline) significantly decreased. Multivariate regression analysis revealed that changes in HOMA-IR explained 23% of the variations of serum UA levels under L-T4 replacement therapy (β = 0.295, p < 0.0001, R2 = 0.230). Our study suggests that thyroid hormones could modulate UA metabolism in patients with recent onset subclinical hypothyroidism likely by improving insulin sensitivity.",Effects of Small-Sided Games vs. Conventional Endurance Training on Endurance Performance in Male Youth Soccer Players: A Meta-Analytical Comparison.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30868441,"Sports medicine (Auckland, N.Z.)",2019 04 15,Small-sided games have been suggested as a viable alternative to conventional endurance training to enhance endurance performance in youth soccer players.

Dental biotribology, has been one of the most important branches in biotribology in recent years. The aim of this research is to investigate the tribological performances in the tooth-to-tooth contact and material-to-natural tooth contact (zirconia vs. zirconia and natural tooth vs. zirconia). The presented research was carried out by testing the above mentioned tribological pairs with the use of a reciprocating tribometer under lubricated conditions (artificial saliva). The normal force used in the tests was 20 N the time for each test was of 60 min. The stroke length was 2 mm, according to the range of displacement used in scientific literature. The wear mass loss evaluation was evaluated by using a gravimetric method. In order to characterize the wear mechanisms, present in the worn surfaces after each of tribo-tests, a topographic analysis was carried with a 3D non-contact optical profiler. The results show that the minimum value of the COF is obtained in the case of Zirconia vs. Zirconia tribo-couple. The results on the wear mass loss show a very low wear rate when coupling in tribological condition natural tooth with a ceramic restoration (a mean value of 0.5 mg was found). This rate is even lower when the contact is between two artificial zirconia teeth.",Magnetic resonance imaging of the sacroiliac joints in SpA: with or without intravenous contrast media?

Animal,2019 04 06,"The isolation of a cell line, PICM-31D, with phenotypic characteristics like pancreatic duct cells is described. The PICM-31D cell line was derived from the previously described pig embryonic stem cell-derived exocrine pancreatic cell line, PICM-31. The PICM-31D cell line was morphologically distinct from the parental cells in growing as a monolayer rather than self-assembling into multicellular acinar-like structures. The PICM-31D cells were propagated for over a year at split ratios of 1:3 to 1:10 at each passage without change in phenotype or growth rate. Electron microscopy showed the cells to be a polarized epithelium of cuboidal cells joined by tight junction-like adhesions at their apical/lateral aspect. The cells contained numerous mucus-like secretory vesicles under their apical cell membrane. Proteomic analysis of the PICM-31D's cellular proteins detected MUC1 and MUC4, consistent with mucus vesicle morphology. Gene expression analysis showed the cells expressed pancreatic ductal cell-related transcription factors such as GATA4, GATA6, HES1, HNF1A, HNF1B, ONECUT1 (HNF6), PDX1, and SOX9, but little or no pancreas progenitor cell markers such as PTF1A, NKX6-1, SOX2, or NGN3. Pancreas ductal cell-associated genes including CA2, CFTR, MUC1, MUC5B, MUC13, SHH, TFF1, KRT8, and KRT19 were expressed by the PICM-31D cells, but the exocrine pancreas marker genes, CPA1 and PLA2G1B, were not expressed by the cells. However, the exocrine marker, AMY2A, was still expressed by the cells. Surprisingly, uroplakin proteins were prominent in the PICM-31D cell proteome, particularly UPK1A. Annexin A1 and A2 proteins were also relatively abundant in the cells. The expression of the uroplakin and annexin genes was detected in the cells, although only UPK1B, UPK3B, ANXA2, and ANXA4 were detected in fetal pig pancreatic duct tissue. In conclusion, the PICM-31D cell line models the mucus-secreting ductal cells of the fetal pig pancreas."

Twenty-four consecutive patients treated surgically for malignant meningioma at the Department of Neurosurgery and the Department of Pathology, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark, from December 2000 to March 2014 were retrospectively evaluated regarding progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Clinical parameters were recorded. All specimens underwent immunohistochemical analysis for Ki-67 and phosphohistone-H3 (PHH3). Prognostication was assessed with Cox proportional hazard regression analysis. The median follow-up was 46.1 months (range 0.7-150.7). The median progression-free survival was 16.5 months (95% CI 11.4-43.0) and the median overall survival was 46.6 months (95% CI 20.4-NA). Six patients were alive at the end of follow-up; two of these had not experienced a recurrence. No clinical parameter showed significant association with PFS or OS. Mitotic index (MI) was significantly associated with PFS and OS, and PHH3 MI with PFS. Immunohistochemical reactivity of Ki-67 > 10% was a negative predictor of PFS (HR 3.92, 95% CI 1.47-10.4, p = 0.0063) and OS (HR 3.35, 95% CI 1.12-10.1, p = 0.0313). The histological subgrouping of grade III meningioma into anaplastic and non-anaplastic revealed increased PFS for the latter (HR 4.57, CI 95% 1.32-15.7, p = 0.0164). We could not verify previous clinical parameters as prognostic factors in malignant meningioma. MI and the PHH3 MI were prognostic within WHO grade III meningiomas for PFS. An overall tumor staining of Ki-67 > 10% correlated with PFS and OS within grade III tumors.",Psychological markers of longevity in Sardinian centenarians: the impact of developmental factors and social desirability.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30868424,Aging clinical and experimental research,2019 03 14,"A body of research documented that the study of mental health of the oldest individuals may contribute to understand the psychological characteristics of longevity. This study had two related aims. First, to fully characterize the psychological health of Sardinian elders in the very late adult span. Second, to determine the psychological health of long-lived individuals (i.e., centenarians) from this population. Three gender-matched age groups (octogenarian, nonagenarian, centenarian) of cognitively healthy, community dwelling adults were recruited in Sardinia, an Italian island characterized by higher levels of longevity. Comparisons of total and sub-scale levels of psychological well-being and depressive symptomatology were made while controlling for social desirability. There were few differences in any index of psychological health between the groups; only a decrease in the coping strategies sub-scale of psychological well-being was observed between the centenarians and the octogenarians. Social desirability was differentially associated with specific dimensions of depressive symptoms and psychological well-being. These findings highlight that there is minimal age-related decline in the psychological health of a longevous population, even among its very oldest members. The present outcomes suggest that older Sardinians represent an advantageous population for the investigation of the psychological markers of longevity, since they demonstrate positive adaptation to the challenges (e.g., changes related to their social network) of very late adulthood.","The Genus Solanum: An Ethnopharmacological, Phytochemical and Biological Properties Review.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30868423,Natural products and bioprospecting,2019 04 07,"Over the past 30 years, the genus Solanum has received considerable attention in chemical and biological studies. Solanum is the largest genus in the family Solanaceae, comprising of about 2000 species distributed in the subtropical and tropical regions of Africa, Australia, and parts of Asia, e.g., China, India and Japan. Many of them are economically significant species. Previous phytochemical investigations on Solanum species led to the identification of steroidal saponins, steroidal alkaloids, terpenes, flavonoids, lignans, sterols, phenolic comopunds, coumarins, amongst other compounds. Many species belonging to this genus present huge range of pharmacological activities such as cytotoxicity to different tumors as breast cancer (4T1 and EMT), colorectal cancer (HCT116, HT29, and SW480), and prostate cancer (DU145) cell lines. The biological activities have been attributed to a number of steroidal saponins, steroidal alkaloids and phenols. This review features 65 phytochemically studied species of Solanum between 1990 and 2018, fetched from SciFinder, Pubmed, ScienceDirect, Wikipedia and Baidu, using ""Solanum"" and the species' names as search terms (""all fields"").","Aging, comorbidities, and the importance of finding biomarkers for HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30868422,Journal of neurovirology,2019 04 21,"HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) continue to affect a large proportion of persons living with HIV despite effective viral suppression with combined antiretroviral therapy (cART). Importantly, milder versions of HAND have become more prevalent. The pathogenesis of HAND in the era of cART appears to be multifactorial with contributions from central nervous system (CNS) damage that occur prior to starting cART, chronic immune activation, cART neurotoxicity, and various age-related comorbidities (i.e., cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease, diabetes, hyperlipidemia). Individuals with HIV may experience premature aging, which could also contribute to cognitive impairment. Likewise, degenerative disorders aside from HAND increase with age and there is evidence of shared pathology between HAND and other neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, which can occur with or without co-existing HAND. Given the aforementioned complex interactions associated with HIV, cognitive impairment, and aging, it is important to consider an age-appropriate differential diagnosis for HAND as the HIV-positive population continues to grow older. These factors make the accuracy and reliability of the diagnosis of mild forms of HAND in an aging population of HIV-infected individuals challenging. The complexity of current diagnosis of mild HAND also highlights the need to develop reliable biomarkers. Ultimately, the identification of a set of specific biomarkers will be required to achieve early and accurate diagnosis, which will be necessary assuming specific treatments for HAND are developed.",Does HIV infection contribute to increased beta-amyloid synthesis and plaque formation leading to neurodegeneration and Alzheimer's disease?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30868421,Journal of neurovirology,2019 03 14,"HIV infection in the combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) era has become a chronic disease with a life expectancy almost identical to those free from this infection. Concomitantly, chronic diseases such as neurodegenerative diseases have emerged as serious clinical problems. HIV-induced cognitive changes, although clinically very diverse are collectively called HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND). HAND, which until the introduction of cART manifested clinically as a subcortical disorder, is now considered primarily cognitive disorder, which makes it similar to diseases like Alzheimer's (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). The pathogenesis involves either the direct effects of the virus or the effect of viral proteins such as Tat, Ggp120, and Nef. These proteins are either capable of destroying neurons directly by inducing neurotoxic mediators or by initiating neuroinflammation by microglia and astrocytes. Recently, it has become recognized that HIV infection is associated with increased production of the beta-amyloid peptide (Aβ) which is a characteristic of AD. Moreover, amyloid plaques have also been demonstrated in the brains of patients suffering from HAND. Thus, the question arises whether this production of Aβ indicates that HAND may lead to AD or it is a form of AD or this increase in Aβ production is only a bystander effect. It has also been discovered that APP in HIV and its metabolic product Aβ in AD manifest antiviral innate immune peptide characteristics. This review attempts to bring together studies linking amyloid precursor protein (APP) and Aβ production in HIV infection and their possible impact on the course of HAND and AD. These data indicate that human defense mechanisms in HAND and AD are trying to contain microorganisms by antimicrobial peptides, however by employing different means. Future studies will, no doubt, uncover the relationship between HAND and AD and, hopefully, reveal novel treatment possibilities.","Epidemiological and clinical study of hip fracture in hospitalized elderly patients in Shanghai, China.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30868420,Archives of osteoporosis,2019 03 14,"In this study, we attempted to determine the epidemiology and clinical characteristics of hip fracture in the elderly.

Metabolic reprogramming is a feature of neoplasia and tumor growth. Understanding the metabolic alterations in bladder cancer may provide new directions for bladder cancer treatment. Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) is a lysine deacetylase of multiple targets including metabolic regulators. In pancreatic cancer, the loss of SIRT1 is accompanied by a decreased expression of proteins in the glycolysis pathway, such as GLUT1, and cancer cell proliferation. Thus, we hypothesize that SIRT1 may interact with GLUT1 to modulate the proliferation and glycolysis phenotype in bladder cancer. In the present study, the expression of SIRT1 and GLUT1 was upregulated in BC tissues and cell lines and positively correlated in tissue samples. SIRT1 overexpression or GLUT1 overexpression alone was sufficient to promote cell proliferation and glucose uptake in BC cells. EX527, a specific inhibitor of SIRT1, exerted an opposing effect on bladder cancer proliferation and glucose uptake. The effect of EX527 could be partially reversed by GLUT1 overexpression. More importantly, SIRT1 overexpression significantly promoted the transcriptional activity and expression of GLUT1, indicating that SIRT1 increases the transcription activity and expression of GLUT1, therefore, promoting the cell proliferation and glycolysis in BC cells. Our study first reported that SIRT1/GLUT1 axis promotes bladder cancer progression via regulation of glucose uptake.",The cortical distribution of first and second language in the right hemisphere of bilinguals - an exploratory study by repetitive navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30868405,Brain imaging and behavior,2019 03 14,"First language (L1) and second language (L2) processing in bilinguals is not yet fully understood, especially not when considering the non-dominant hemisphere. Ten healthy, right-handed volunteers underwent language mapping of the right hemisphere by repetitive navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation and an object-naming task in their L1 and L2. All elicited naming errors together, no responses, and all errors without hesitation were analyzed separately for cortical distributions of error rates (ERs: number of errors divided by the number of applied stimulations). No significant differences (p > 0.05) were found in ERs between the L1 and L2 for all errors (L1 20.6 ± 14.8%, L2 15.4 ± 11.2%), no responses (L1 13.5 ± 10.9%, L2 9.2 ± 10.8%), and all errors without hesitation (L1 14.4 ± 11.2%, L2 10.8 ± 10.0%). The areas that showed high ERs for the L1 included the dorsal precentral and middle precentral gyrus, whereas the triangular inferior frontal gyrus showed high ERs for the L2. When focusing on error distributions per single stimulation points, differences in ERs between the L1 and L2 were initially observed for stimulation within the angular and middle middle frontal gyrus, but did not withstand correction for the false discovery rate (FDR-corrected p > 0.05). In conclusion, this exploratory study shows the feasibility of rTMS to the right hemisphere for language mapping and reveals cortical areas involved in L1 and L2 processing, but has to be followed up by larger studies enrolling more homogeneous cohorts.",Longitudinal growth of the basal ganglia and thalamus in very preterm children.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30868404,Brain imaging and behavior,2019 03 14,"The impact of very preterm (VP) birth on the development of individual basal ganglia nuclei and the thalamus during childhood remains unclear. We first aimed to compare (1a) the volumes of individual basal ganglia nuclei (nucleus accumbens, caudate nucleus, pallidum, putamen) and the thalamus at age 7 years, and (1b) their volumetric change from infancy to 7 years, in VP children with term-born children. Secondly, we aimed to (2a) determine whether basal ganglia and thalamic volumes at 7 years, or (2b) basal ganglia and thalamic growth rates from infancy to 7 years were associated with neurodevelopmental outcomes at 7 years, and whether these associations differed between the VP and term-born children. One hundred and fifty-four VP (<30 weeks' gestational age or birth weight < 1250 g) and 35 term-born children had useable magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans that could be analyzed at 7 years. Of these, 149 VP and 30 term-born infants also had useable MRI scans at term-equivalent age. Volumes of the individual basal ganglia nuclei and the thalamus were automatically generated from the MRI scans. Compared with the term-born group, the VP group had smaller basal ganglia and thalamic volumes at 7 years and slower growth rates from birth to 7 years. After controlling for overall brain size, VP children still had smaller thalamic volumes but the deep grey matter volume growth rates from birth to 7 years were similar between groups. Reduced basal ganglia and thalamic volumes and slower growth rates in the VP group were associated with poorer cognition, academic achievement and motor function at 7 years. After controlling for overall brain size, the nucleus accumbens and pallidum were the deep grey matter structures most strongly associated with 7-year neurodevelopmental outcomes. In conclusion, basal ganglia and thalamic growth is delayed during early childhood in VP children, with delayed development contributing to poorer functional outcomes.",Plasticity of the resting-state brain: static and dynamic functional connectivity change induced by divergent thinking training.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30868403,Brain imaging and behavior,2019 03 14,"Creativity is very important and is linked to almost all areas of our everyday life. Improving creativity brings great benefits. Various strategies and training paradigms have been used to stimulate creative thinking. These training approaches have been confirmed to be effective. However, whether or not training can reshape the resting-state brain is still unclear. The present study examined whether or not the divergent thinking training intervention can reshape the resting-state brain functional connectivity (FC). Static seed-based and dynamic approaches were used to explore this problem. Results demonstrate significant changes in static and dynamic FCs. FCs, such as dorsal anterior cingulate cortex-inferior parietal lobule, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex-precuneus and left and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, was significantly improved through the training. Furthermore, the temporal variability of the supplementary motor area and middle temporal gyrus was improved. These results indicate that divergent thinking training may lead to resting-state brain plasticity. Considering the role of these regions in brain networks, the present study further confirms the close relationship between the brain networks' dynamic interactions and divergent thinking processes.",Identifying generalized anxiety disorder using resting state habenular circuitry.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30868402,Brain imaging and behavior,2019 03 14,"Studies identify the habenula as a key subcortical component in anxiety, with a role in predicting error coding within the evaluative system. However, no clinical reports of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) describe resting state functional connectivity of habenular circuits. We hypothesized that resting-state functional connectivities of habenula would show differences in neuroanatomical correlates of the evaluative system (prefrontal cortex, habenula) of patients with GAD. We obtained 22 patients with GAD and 21 HCs, matched for gender, age, and years of education. Resting-state functional connectivity of the habenula was assessed using a seed-based template imposed on whole brain MRI, which provided an objective and semi-automated segmentation algorithm in MNI space. Patients with GAD demonstrated enhanced connectivities in the bilateral premotor cortex, right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, medial frontal cortex, as well as the left orbitofrontal cortex, and reduced connectivities in the left posterior cingulate cortex, and right pulvinar. Moreover, striking differences of abnormal connectivities between groups were observed via analysis of receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC) of statistically significant. These results including ROC curves suggest the potential importance of the habenula in evaluating and deciding to personally relevant reward-related information.",Fronto-striatal activity predicts anhedonia and positive empathy subtypes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30868401,Brain imaging and behavior,2019 03 14,"The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, globus pallidus, and nucleus accumbens are important components of the reward circuit in the brain; and prior research suggests individuals with damage to these regions feel less pleasure (i.e., are anhedonic). However, little is known about how these brain regions relate to vicarious pleasure. Pilot fMRI data were collected from 20 participants (Mage = 22, SD = 7.0, 63% female) during a validated empathy induction paradigm that utilized video clips extracted from the television show ""Extreme Makeover: Home Edition"" to elicit empathic happiness (i.e. vicarious happiness) when targets display positive affect, and either empathic cheerfulness (i.e. the tendency to want to cheer someone up) or empathic concern (i.e. vicarious sadness) when targets display negative affect. Participants also completed the novel ""Happy Faces"" task-a behavioral measure of anhedonia-while fMRI was collected. fMRI data during task completion were used to predict trait empathy measured via self-report outside of the scanner, and accuracy on the ""Happy Faces"" task. Results indicate that globus pallidus activity during empathic concern-eliciting video clips significantly predicted self-reported trait empathic cheerfulness (R2 = 26%, p = 0.045). Furthermore, greater dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) activity during the Happy Faces task predicted accurate performance on the task (R2 = 34%, p < .05); and greater nucleus accumbens shell activity during the Happy Faces task predicted greater trait empathic happiness (R2 = 38%, p < .05). These results suggest that fronto-striatal circuitry contributes to our experience of anhedonia, empathic happiness, and empathic cheerfulness.",Socioeconomic status in children is associated with spontaneous activity in right superior temporal gyrus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30868400,Brain imaging and behavior,2019 05 30,"Socioeconomic status (SES) during childhood is a well-documented life-course health determinant. Despite recent advances on characterizing brain structural variance associated with SES during development, how it influences brain's functional organization remains elusive. Associations between SES, an fMRI feature of regional spontaneous activity (fractional amplitude of low frequencies fluctuation, fALFF), and behavioral/emotional problems were investigated in a school-based sample of 655 Brazilian children. A voxel-by-voxel approach was applied in order to map brain regions where fALFF was correlated with SES. Based on compelling previous evidence, we hypothesized that fALFF should be associated with SES in areas involved in language processing or cognitive control. Further, we tested if the spontaneous activity in these mapped areas would also correlated with general, internalizing and externalizing problems. SES of children was found to be positively correlated with spontaneous activity in right superior temporal gyrus. In the exploratory analysis, the fALFF of this area was negatively correlated with the expression of internalizing problems. Extending previous behavioral and structural neuroimaging findings, we report an association between SES and the spontaneous activity of a brain area enrolled in the extended language network. This finding is consistent with the hypothesis that the variability on linguistic environment according to SES lead to different developmental trajectories of functional networks instantiating language.",Novel tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes ultrasonography score based on ultrasonic tissue findings predicts tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in breast cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30868399,"Breast cancer (Tokyo, Japan)",2019 03 14,"The presence of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) is a prognostic factor for breast cancer.

Recent studies support an increased cardiovascular disease risk in inflammatory conditions, such as gout. Increased serum urate levels, or hyperuricemia, are a precursor to gout. Data from meta-analyses have shown hyperuricemia to be linked to hypertension and coronary heart disease. Similarly, gout has been associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accidents, and death from cardiovascular disease in randomized clinical trials. Urate-lowering therapy reduces serum urate and may decrease systemic inflammation, generation of oxidative species, and reverses endothelial dysfunction through hyperuricemia-dependent or hyperuricemia-independent pathways. Cardioprotective benefits of allopurinol, a first-line agent for the treatment of gout, have been demonstrated to potentially prevent myocardial infarction, stroke, atrial fibrillation, and other cardiovascular diseases in observational studies in select populations. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have also examined the role of newer urate-lowering therapies, such as febuxostat and lesinurad, and their risk of cardiovascular-specific mortality in comparison to allopurinol. A large post-marketing study of febuxostat vs. allopurinol showed higher all-cause and cardiovascular-specific mortality in the febuxostat group than in the allopurinol group; a major study limitation was that large numbers of patients were lost to follow-up or discontinued treatment. RCTs are required to assess the comparative effectiveness of urate-lowering therapies, validate findings of observational studies, and to determine which subgroup populations of gout are most likely to benefit from appropriate long-term urate-lowering therapy. This review examines the data for increased cardiovascular disease in gout and potential underlying mechanisms (including hyperuricemia, inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, oxidative stress) and the effect of urate-lowering therapy on cardiovascular disease.",Corrections to: Achieving Glycaemic Control with Concentrated Insulin in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30868397,Drugs,2019 05 09,"In several sections of this review article, insulin degludec U100 has been incorrectly referred to as a highly concentrated basal insulin.

In the present work, atomic layer deposition was used to fabricate TiO2 nanomembranes (NMs) with accurately controlled thicknesses. The TiO2 NMs were then used as electrodes for high-performance pseudocapacitors. Experimental results demonstrated that the TiO2 NM with 100 ALD cycles had the highest capacitance of 2332 F/g at 1 A/g with energy density of 81 Wh/kg. The enhanced performance was ascribed to the large surface area and the interconnectivity in the case of ultra-thin and flexible NMs. Increased ALD cycles led to stiffer NMs and decreased capacitance. Moreover, one series of two supercapacitors can light up one light-emitting diode with a working voltage of ~ 1.5 V, sufficiently describing its application values.",Functional characterization of HSFs from wheat in response to heat and other abiotic stress conditions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30868385,Functional & integrative genomics,2019 04 19,"High temperature stress is known to be one of the major limiting factors for wheat productivity worldwide. HSFs are known to play a central role in heat stress response in plants. Hence, the current study is an attempt to explore an in-depth involvement of TaHSFs in stress responses mainly in heat and other abiotic responses like salinity, drought, and cold stress. Effort was made to understand as how the expression of HSF is able to define the differential robustness of wheat varieties. Subsequent studies were done to establish the involvement of any temporal or spatial cue on the behavior of these TaHSFs under heat stress conditions. A total of 53 HSFs have been reported until date and out of these, few TaHSFs including one identified in our library, i.e., TaHsfA2d (Traes_4AS_52EB860E7.2), were selected for the expression analysis studies. The expressions of these HSFs were found to differ in both magnitude and sensitivity to the heat as well as other abiotic stresses. Moreover, these TaHSFs displayed wide range of expression in different tissues like anther, ovary, lemma, palea, awn, glume, and different stages of seed development. Thus, TaHSFs appear to be under dynamic expression as they respond in a unique manner to spatial, temporal, and environmental cues. Therefore, these HSFs can be used as candidate genes for understanding the molecular mechanism under heat stress and can be utilized for improving crop yield by enhancing the tolerance and survival of the crop plants under adverse environment conditions.",Isolation of Bisphenol A-Tolerating/degrading Shewanella haliotis Strain MH137742 from an Estuarine Environment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30868384,Applied biochemistry and biotechnology,2019 03 14,"The human exposure to bisphenol A (BPA) occurs frequently.

An alternative method of removing it from the environment is the use of bioremediation processes to the selected bacteria isolated from a BPA-impacted area. In this work, four halotolerant strains were isolated from the Santos Estuary System, one of the most important Brazilian examples of environmental degradation. In the present work, one strain presented strong BPA tolerance and high BPA-degrading activity and could grow in a minimum medium containing BPA as the main carbon source. Strain MH137742 was identified as Shewanella haliotis, based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing and mass spectrometry identification by MALDI-TOF Biotyper. Shewanella haliotis was able to tolerate up to 150 mg L-1 of BPA and biotransform 75 mg L-1 in 10 h in a liquid culture medium. Based on the analysis of the produced metabolites by LC-MS, it was possible to predict the metabolic pathway used by this microorganism to degrade the BPA.",Optimization of Cellulase and Xylanase Productions by Streptomyces thermocoprophilus Strain TC13W Using Oil Palm Empty Fruit Bunch and Tuna Condensate as Substrates.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30868383,Applied biochemistry and biotechnology,2019 03 14,"The modified medium composed of the alkaline-pretreated oil palm empty fruit bunch (APEFB) and tuna condensate powder was used for cellulase and xylanase productions by Streptomyces thermocoprophilus strain TC13W. The APEFB contained 74.46% (w/w) cellulose, 15.72% (w/w) hemicellulose, and 6.40% (w/w) lignin. The tuna condensate powder contained 55.49% (w/w) protein and 11.05% (w/w) salt. In the modified medium with only 6.75 g/l tuna condensate powder, 10 g/l APEFB, and 0.5 g/l Tween 80, S. thermocoprophilus strain TC13W produced cellulase 4.9 U/ml and xylanase 9.0 U/ml. The enzyme productions in the modified medium were lower than cellulase (6.0 U/ml) and xylanase (12.0 U/ml) productions in the complex medium (CaCl2 0.1, MgSO4·7H2O 0.1, KH2PO4 0.5, K2HPO4 1.0, NaCl 0.2, yeast extract 5.0, NH4NO3 1.0, Tween 80 0.5). When tuna condensate powder in the modified medium was reduced to 5.0 g/l and Tween 80 was increased to 1.5 g/l, S. thermocoprophilus strain TC13W produced cellulase and xylanase activities of 9.1 and 12.1 U/ml, respectively. This study shows that the cost of enzyme production could be reduced by using pretreated EFB and tuna condensate as a carbon and a nitrogen source, respectively.","Production, Partial Purification, and Biochemical Characterization of a Thermotolerant Alkaline Metallo-protease from Staphylococcus sciuri.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30868382,Applied biochemistry and biotechnology,2019 03 14,"Protease-producing Staphylococcus sciuri was isolated from poultry soil samples and culture conditions for protease production were optimized. The isolated protease showed a maximum activity of 235.1 U/ml. Enzyme purification procedure involved ammonium sulphate precipitation and Sephacryl S-200 HR gel filtration chromatography (GFC). The purification process resulted in the production of three protease fractions namely protease І (metallo-alkaline protease), II, and IІІ. The metallo-alkaline protease was purified to 25.49-fold with specific activity of 982.22 U/mg and 3.76% recovery. The partially purified metallo-protease was optimally active at pH 10.0 and 70 °C and exhibited thermal stability up to 50 °C. The protease activity was enhanced by Ca2+ and Mg2+, completely inhibited by Hg2+ and Cu2+, and significantly reduced by EDTA. The protease showed significant stability towards various surfactants, including SDS. The Km and Vmax values were 0.68 mg/ml and 166.66 nmol of azocasein/ml/h, respectively, while the activation energy (Ea) was 3.07 Kcal/mol. Hence, it is evident that the produced protease possesses unique characteristics and could be a plausible candidate for various industrial and biotechnological applications.",Moral hazard under zero price policy: evidence from Japanese long-term care claims data.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30868381,The European journal of health economics : HEPAC : health economics in prevention and care,2019 03 14,"We evaluate the presence and magnitude of moral hazard in Japan's public long-term care insurance (LTCI) market. Using monthly LTCI claim records from January 2006 to December 2015 linked to concurrent death records, we construct a sample by propensity score matching insured individuals who co-pay 10% of their fees to those with no required copayments, and we implement fixed-effect estimations. We find that a ten-percentage-point reduction in the copayment rate increases monthly costs by 10.2 thousand yen, corresponding to a price elasticity of about - 0.1. Insured individuals with no copayments tend to use more services and have more utilization days than those with copayments do. Furthermore, we find that insured individuals who die from cerebral (myocardial) infarction increase their service use more in response to a reduction in the copayment rate than those who die from senility do, indicating a positive association between ex-ante health risks and ex-post service use. We verify that a cost-sharing adjustment is a valid solution for soaring LTCI expenditures. These findings could provide broad implications for the rapidly aging world.",Nuclear cardiology in the context of multimodality imaging to detect cardiac toxicity from cancer therapeutics: Established and emerging methods.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30868378,Journal of nuclear cardiology : official publication of the American Society of Nuclear Cardiology,2019 03 14,"The complexity of cancer therapies has vastly expanded in the last decade, along with type and severity of cardiac toxicities associated with these treatments.

However, the validity of this argument has not been empirically explored in the extant literature of construction management. Therefore, this study examines the stages of the construction process susceptibility to corruption and its most prominent forms of corrupt activities (within the respective stages). A total of forty-four project-related professionals were involved in an expert survey to assess such susceptibilities and the criticality of the identified corrupt activities at each stage. A comparative study of expert views from developing regions against experts from developed regions is conducted. Expert scoring results revealed that three stages are most susceptible, namely: project execution, pre-qualification and tender stages. Such results were confirmed by application of the Mann-Whitney U test statistics tool, showing wide disparities in seven out of eleven identical stages. This study is intended to incite polemic discussions and greater empirical, evidence-based research from scholars in both developed and developing countries. This study adds to the extant literature corruption-related works on the construction process through deeper understanding of the dynamic nature of corrupt practices involved in the stages of the construction process in developing countries. Practically, it intends to offer a veritable plethora of information on the critical stages of the construction process for industry practitioners, policymakers and anti-corruption bodies to careen their attention towards the fight against corruption.",Integrating temporal refugia into landscapes of fear: prey exploit predator downtimes to forage in risky places.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30868375,Oecologia,2019 05 02,"The landscape of fear is an important driver of prey space use. However, prey can navigate the landscape of fear by exploiting temporal refuges from predation risk. We hypothesized that diel patterns of predator and prey movement and space use would be inversely correlated due to temporal constraints on predator habitat domain. Specifically, we evaluated habitat selection and activity of the vicuña and its only predator, the puma, during three diel periods: day, dawn/dusk, and night. Pumas selected the same habitats regardless of diel period-vegetated and rugged areas that feature stalking cover for pumas-but increased their activity levels during dawn/dusk and night when they benefit from reduced detection by prey. Vicuñas avoided areas selected by pumas and reduced activity at night, but selected vegetated areas and increased activity by day and dawn/dusk. Vicuña habitat selection and movement strategies appeared to reduce the risk of encountering pumas; movement rates of pumas and vicuñas were negatively correlated across the diel cycle, and habitat selection was negatively correlated during dawn/dusk and night. Our study shows that an ambush predator's temporal activity and space use patterns interact to create diel refugia and shape the antipredator behaviors of its prey. Importantly, it is likely the very nature of ambush predators' static habitat specificity that makes predator activity important to temporally varying perceptions of risk. Prey which depend on risky habitats for foraging appear to mitigate risk by feeding when they can more easily detect predators and when predators are least active."

Buffon, Bonnet, C.F. Wolff.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30868363,History and philosophy of the life sciences,2019 06 13,"This paper seeks to characterize how the study of nutrition processes contributed to revisit the problem of vital organization in the late eighteenth century. It argues that focusing on nutrition leads to reformulate the problem of the relation between life and organization in terms of processes, rather than static or given structures. This nutrition-centered approach to life amounts to acknowledge the specific strategic role nutrition played in the development of a materialist approach to the generation of vital organization. The paper proposes a clarification of the multiple meanings of the concept of organization in the context of Enlightenment physiology and nascent biology, before focusing on the century long analogy between nutrition and generation. It shows how, by contrasting different uses of this analogy, nutrition was employed as a key vital phenomenon in the development of epigenetic theories of generation, i.e. how a nutritive modeling of generation was used in the undermining of preformationism. To this purpose I contrast two seemingly opposite theories of generation, Buffon's and Bonnet's, and show that despite the obvious metaphysical discontent, their views of generation share a common mechanical conceptual frame in which nutrition is conflated with growth and repair. I then turn to the role nutrition played in the epigenetic conception of generation in C. F. Wolff's embryology and analyze this rival understanding of nutrition as an organizing process.",All-Solid-State Flexible Asymmetric Supercapacitor with Good Cycling Performance and Ultra-Power Density by Electrode Materials of Core-Shell CoNiO2@NiAl-Layered Double Hydroxide and Hollow Spherical α-Fe2O3.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30868362,Nanoscale research letters,2019 04 07,"High electrochemical performance of asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) depends on exquisite nanostructure design and synthesis of electrodes, including structural controllable design and synthesis of high theoretical performance materials and nanocomposite materials. Herein, a template-free hierarchical core-shell nanostructure of CoNiO2@NiAl-layered double hydroxide (NiAl-LDH) and α-Fe2O3 with a hollow spherical structure composed of nanoparticles are successfully prepared. The CoNiO2@NiAl-LDH as the cathode electrode and the hollow spherical α-Fe2O3 as the anode electrode of the ASC devices exhibit superior electrochemical performance. The gel of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and KOH acts as the solid electrolyte and the separator to assemble into the all-solid-state flexible ASC devices. Two of the CoNiO2@NiAl-LDH//α-Fe2O3 ASC devices in series are fabricated to meet the voltage requirement of mobile energy equipment, which exhibit a maximum energy density of 65.68 Wh kg-1 at the power density of 369.45 W kg-1. Interestingly, in addition to many advantages that the solid electrolyte in ASC devices already have, we find that it can be an alternative way of solving the problem of iron oxide cycling performance, and of course it can also be used as a reference for other materials with poor cycling performance.",Metabolomics profiles of patients with Wilson disease reveal a distinct metabolic signature.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30868361,Metabolomics : Official journal of the Metabolomic Society,2019 06 16,"Wilson disease (WD) is characterized by excessive intracellular copper accumulation in liver and brain due to defective copper biliary excretion.

BBTV-encoded protein B4 is a determinant of pathogenicity. However, the relevant molecular mechanisms underlying its effects remain unknown. In this study, we found that a functional peptide could be liberated from protein B4, likely via proteolytic processing. Site-directed mutagenesis indicated that the functional processing of protein B4 is required for its pathogenic effects, including dwarfism and sterility, in plants. The released protein fragment targets host proteins, such as the large subunit of RuBisCO (RbcL) and elongation factor 2 (EF2), involved in protein synthesis. Therefore, the peptide released from B4 (also a precursor) may act as a non-canonical modifier to influence host-pathogen interactions involving BBTV and plants.",Bacteriophages Isolated in China for the Control of Pectobacterium carotovorum Causing Potato Soft Rot in Kenya.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30868359,Virologica Sinica,2019 03 14,"Soft rot is an economically significant disease in potato and one of the major threats to sustainable potato production. This study aimed at isolating lytic bacteriophages and evaluating methods for and the efficacy of applying phages to control potato soft rot caused by Pectobacterium carotovorum. Eleven bacteriophages isolated from soil and water samples collected in Wuhan, China, were used to infect P. carotovorum host strains isolated from potato tubers showing soft rot symptoms in Nakuru county, Kenya. The efficacy of the phages in controlling soft rot disease was evaluated by applying individual phage strains or a phage cocktail on potato slices and tubers at different time points before or after inoculation with a P. carotovorum strain. The phages could lyse 20 strains of P. carotovorum, but not Pseudomonas fluorescens control strains. Among the 11 phages, Pectobacterium phage Wc5r, interestingly showed cross-activity against Pectobacterium atrosepticum and two phage-resistant P. carotovorum strains. Potato slice assays showed that the phage concentration and timing of application are crucial factors for effective soft rot control. Phage cocktail applied at a concentration of 1 × 109 plaque-forming units per milliliter before or within an hour after bacterial inoculation on potato slices, resulted in ≥ 90% reduction of soft rot symptoms. This study provides a basis for the development and application of phages to reduce the impact of potato soft rot disease.","Stakeholders' Views on Early Diagnosis for Alzheimer's Disease, Clinical Trial Participation and Amyloid PET Disclosure: A Focus Group Study.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30868358,Journal of bioethical inquiry,2019 05 13,"Detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in an early stage is receiving increasing attention for a number of reasons, such as the failure of drug trials in more advanced disease stages, the demographic evolution, the financial impact of AD, and the approval of amyloid tracers for clinical use. Five focus group interviews with stakeholders (healthy elderly, informal caregivers, nursing staff, researchers, and clinicians) were conducted.. The verbatim transcripts were analysed via the Nvivo 11 software. Most stakeholder groups wanted to know their own amyloid PET scan result. However, differences occurred between FGs: two groups (informal caregivers and researchers) wanted to know, whilst in the three other groups (healthy elderly, nursing staff, and clinicians) FG members opted not to know or were still in doubt about their decision. Stakeholders provided insight into their reasons for wanting to know their amyloid PET scan result (e.g., the need for clarity, to inform relatives, to make arrangements), for not wanting to know their result, or why they were in doubt about their decision (e.g., fear of AD, not wanting to burden their social environment). Several advantages (e.g., to know what is going on with their health, to plan for the future) and disadvantages (e.g., absence of a disease modifying treatment, risks when undergoing tests) were mentioned as part of knowing their amyloid PET scan result. Certain considerations were clustered in a grey zone, in between advantage and disadvantage, such as the emotional consequences. Clinicians, researchers, and policymakers ought to be aware of the diversity of reasons for (not) wanting to know their result and how possible benefits and risks can be viewed differently.

A complete understanding of cellular processes is impossible without knowing the structure-function relationship of participating RNA molecules that ultimately requires large quantities of pure RNAs. Thus, structural/functional analyses of emerging RNAs necessitate revised protocols for improved RNA quantity and quality. Here we present a modified in vitro transcription protocol to enhance ribozyme cleaving efficiency and RNA yield by working on two variables, i.e., incubation temperature and limiting GTPs. Following an improved RNA synthesis, the target RNA is purified from transcription mixture components through denaturing size-exclusion chromatography. The protocol confirms that cyclic elevated incubation temperatures during transcription and increased concentrations of GTPs improve the production rate of RNA. Our modified in vitro transcription method improves the ribozyme cleaving efficiency and targets RNA yield by four- to fivefold that can benefit almost any RNA-related study from protein-RNA interaction analysis to crystallography."

Eighty Angus steers (388.8 ± 2.1 kg) were orally administered with rumen temperature boluses. Rumen temperatures were recorded at 10-min intervals over 128 days from all 80 steers. To define the suitability of TRUM as an estimation of TCORE, TREC were obtained from all steers at 7-day intervals (n = 16). Eight feedlot pens were used where there were 10 steers per pen (162 m2). Shade was available in each pen (1.8 m2/animal; 90% solar block). Climatic data were recorded at 30-min intervals, including ambient temperature (TA; °C); relative humidity (RH; %); wind speed (WS; m/s) and direction; solar radiation (SR; W/m2); and black globe temperature (BGT; °C). Rainfall (mm) was recorded daily at 0900 h. From these data, temperature humidity index (THI), heat load index (HLI) and accumulated heat load (AHL) were calculated. Individual 10-min TRUM data were converted to an individual hourly average. Pooled mean hourly TRUM data from the 128-day data were used to establish the diurnal rhythm of TRUM where the mean minimum (39.19 ± 0.01 °C) and mean maximum (40.04 ± 0.01 °C) were observed at 0800 h and 2000 h respectively. A partial correlation coefficient indicated that there were moderate to strong relationships between TRUM and TREC using both real-time (r = 0.55; P < 0.001) and hourly mean (r = 0.51; P < 0.001) TRUM data. The mean difference between TREC and TRUM was small using both real-time (0.16 ± 0.02 °C) and hourly mean TRUM (0.13 ± 0.02 °C) data.

Therefore, we examine the distribution of Slc35f1 protein in the murine forebrain using immunohistochemistry. We could demonstrate that Slc35f1 is highly expressed in the adult mouse brain in a variety of different brain structures, including the cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, thalamus, basal ganglia, and hypothalamus. To examine the possible roles of Slc35f1 and its subcellular localization, we used an in vitro glioblastoma cell line expressing Slc35f1. Co-labeling experiments were performed to reveal the subcellular localization of Slc35f1. Our results indicate that Slc35f1 neither co-localizes with markers for the Golgi apparatus nor with markers for the endoplasmic reticulum. Time-lapse microscopy of living cells revealed that Slc35f1-positive structures are highly dynamic and resemble vesicles. Using super-resolution microscopy, these Slc35f1-positive spots clearly co-localize with the recycling endosome marker Rab11.","Stages of sarcopenia, bone mineral density, and the prevalence of osteoporosis in older women.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30868338,Archives of osteoporosis,2019 03 14,"A better understanding of the relationship between osteoporosis and sarcopenia may help to develop effective preventive and therapeutic strategies.

Binary and multinomial logistic models were used, adjusting for demographics, and stratified by level of religiosity. Of the 986 students responding to the survey, 65% were females; 48% had experienced some form of bullying; and 52% self-rated as low in religiosity. Between 10 and 30% were current users of alcohol or tobacco. Students of lower religiosity levels who had been bullied were more likely to use substances than those who self-rated as high religiosity. Religiosity may be a potential moderator of the association between being bullied and substance use, but the exact mechanisms and underlying reasons need further investigation.",The formation of spinel-group minerals in contaminated soils: the sequestration of metal(loid)s by unexpected incidental nanoparticles.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30868335,Geochemical transactions,2019 03 14,"Mineralogical studies of contaminated soils affected by smelter emission and dust from mining activities indicate that minerals of the spinel group are one of the common hosts of metal-bearing contaminants. Spinel group minerals typically originate from high temperature processes, but an increasing number of studies indicate that metal-bearing spinel group minerals can also form under ambient Earth surface conditions in surficial soils. In this contribution to honor Donald Sparks, we show that the spinels Zn-bearing magnetite (Zn0.5Fe2.5O4) and minium (Pb3O4) form during low temperature alteration of Pb-bearing silica glass in surficial organic rich soils in proximity to a former Cu-smelter in Timmins, Ontario, Canada. The glass most likely formed during high-temperature processes and has been either emitted by the smelter or wind-blown from waste rock piles to near-by soils. The alteration of the glass by percolating pore solutions has resulted in the formation of large micrometer-size dendritic etch features and in nanometer-size dendritic alteration halos composed of nano-size prismatic crystals of Zn-rich magnetite and spherical nanoparticles of minium. Both spinel-type phases are embedded in an amorphous silica matrix which formed during the alteration of the glass at low temperature. A review on the occurrence of spinel-group minerals in smelter-affected soils or mine tailings indicates that the formation of these minerals under ambient Earth surface conditions is quite common and often results in the sequestration of contaminants such as Cu, Ni, Zn and Sb. The pedogenic spinels often occur as euhedral crystals in nano-size mineral assemblages within alteration features such as dendritic etch patterns, mineral surface coatings and mineralized organic matter. Their well-developed crystal forms indicate that (a) they have not formed during a rapid cooling process in a smelter or refinery which typically creates spherical particulate matter, and (b) they have not been part of particulate matter added via fluvial or Aeolian processes which most commonly yield anhedral morphologies. The formation of nano-size spinel-group minerals in low temperature environmental settings may lead to the long-term storage of metal(loid)s in mineral phases and their transport over vast distances via fluvial, alluvial and Aeolian processes.",Mass spectrometry-based metabolomics of volatiles as a new tool for understanding aroma and flavour chemistry in processed food products.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30868334,Metabolomics : Official journal of the Metabolomic Society,2019 05 15,"When foods are processed or cooked, many chemical reactions occur involving a wide range of metabolites including sugars, amino acids and lipids.

Retrospective analysis of a prospectively maintained institutional database on consecutive patients undergoing elective robotic resection for diverticular disease (2014-2018). All procedures were performed within an enhanced recovery pathway (ERP). Demographic, surgical and ERP-related items were compared between patients with simple and complicated diverticular disease according to intra-operative presentation. Postoperative complications and length of stay were compared between the two groups. Out of 150 patients, 78 (52%) presented with complicated and the remaining 72 (48%) with uncomplicated disease. Both groups were comparable regarding demographic baseline characteristics and overall ERP compliance. Surgery for complicated disease was longer (288 ± 96 vs. 258 ± 72 min, p = 0.04) and more contaminated (≥ class 3: 57.7 vs. 23.6%, p < 0.001) with a trend to higher conversion rates (10.3 vs. 2.8%, p = 0.1). While postoperative overall complications tended to occur more often after resections for complicated disease (28.2 vs. 15.3%, p = 0.075), major, surgical and medical complications did not differ between the two groups, and median length of stay was 3 days in both settings (p = 0.19).

Adverse effects can occur. Osteoarticular complications are mainly reactive arthritis, but true infections have been described, such as vertebral osteomyelitis. We made a review of M. bovis BCG vertebral osteomyelitis after instillations for bladder cancer using PubMed search. We added three new French cases. Twenty-seven cases of BCG vertebral osteomyelitis had been reported on PubMed. Of the 30 cases, all were male, averaging 73.4 ± 8.7 years old. Median time between diagnosis and first and last instillation was 22.5 and 14 months respectively. Half of vertebral osteomyelitis was thoracic and lumbar in the other half. Sensitivo-motor deficit was present at diagnosis in 42% of cases. Other infectious locations were common, mainly infectious abdominal aortic aneurysms (20%). Rifampicin, ethambutol and isoniazid were the usual therapy. Poor outcomes were reported with 50% of one or more spine surgery. M. bovis BCG vertebral osteomyelitis following bladder instillation for bladder cancer is a rare complication. However, the late onset of back pain after instillations differentiates them from reactive arthritis. Concomitant septic location such as infectious abdominal aortic aneurysms must be known.","Associations between paraoxonase 1 (PON1) polymorphisms and susceptibility and PON1 activity in rheumatoid arthritis patients, and comparison of PON1 activity in patients and controls: a meta-analysis.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30868319,Clinical rheumatology,2019 03 14,We reviewed the associations between paraoxonase 1 (PON1) polymorphisms and susceptibility and PON1 activity in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients and compared PON1 activity between RA patients and controls.,Optimal respiratory-gated [18F]FDG PET/CT significantly impacts the quantification of metabolic parameters and their correlation with overall survival in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30868318,EJNMMI research,2019 04 07,"Metabolic parameters are increasingly being used to characterize tumors.

We realized FOV changes at the fiber tip in the bulk tissue using a variable aperture that was located outside the bulk tissue through a short high-numerical aperture (high-NA) multi-mode fiber with a quasi-straight shape. Using a homogeneous optical model solution, we verified the principle and operation of the constructed experimental system. A 200-μm-core-diameter silica fiber with NA of 0.5 and length of 1 m installed in a 21G needle was used. The detection fiber's shape was maintained over a radius of curvature of 30 cm. The dependences of the detected light intensity on the FOV and the depth showed better than 1.4% accuracy versus calculated dependences based on the measured optical properties of the solution. Adaptation of the method for use with complex structured biological tissue, particularly in the presence of a thick fascia, was not completely resolved. However, we believe that our specific fiber puncture-based measurement method for use in bulk tissue based on variation of the FOV with inverse Monte Carlo method-based analysis will be useful in obtaining optical coefficients while avoiding sample preparation-related instabilities.","Relationship between health care insurance status, social determinants and prevalence of diabetes-related microvascular complications in patients with type 1 diabetes: a nationwide survey in Brazil.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30868316,Acta diabetologica,2019 05 15,"To evaluate the relationship between social determinants, health care insurance status and occurrence of diabetes-related chronic complications (DRCC) in Brazilian patients with type 1 diabetes.",Oral glucose effectiveness and metabolic risk in obese children and adolescents.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30868315,Acta diabetologica,2019 03 14,To investigate whether GE is affected in children/adolescents with obesity and abnormalities of the metabolic syndrome (MetS).,Exploring the GDB-13 chemical space using deep generative models.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30868314,Journal of cheminformatics,2019 03 29,"Recent applications of recurrent neural networks (RNN) enable training models that sample the chemical space.

We show that a model trained with 1 million structures (0.1% of the database) reproduces 68.9% of the entire database after training, when sampling 2 billion molecules. We also developed a method to assess the quality of the training process using negative log-likelihood plots. Furthermore, we use a mathematical model based on the ""coupon collector problem"" that compares the trained model to an upper bound and thus we are able to quantify how much it has learned. We also suggest that this method can be used as a tool to benchmark the learning capabilities of any molecular generative model architecture. Additionally, an analysis of the generated chemical space was performed, which shows that, mostly due to the syntax of SMILES, complex molecules with many rings and heteroatoms are more difficult to sample.",Management of Grassland-like Wildflower Strips Sown on Nutrient-rich Arable Soils: The Role of Grass Density and Mowing Regime.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30868313,Environmental management,2019 05 12,"Wildflower strips (WS) are proposed in many European countries as a strategy to enhance biodiversity and ecosystem services in arable fields. To create and maintain WS on nutrient-rich cultivated soils reveals challenging. Flowered species may be outcompeted by grasses due to high phosphorus content in soil. We studied during 5 years seed mixture (grass density in the seed mix) and mowing regime influenced the ability of WS to provide environmental benefits (flower provision for insects and landscape purposes, reduction of soil nutrient load) and respond to farmer concerns (noxious weed promotion, forage production). Lowered grass density increased flower abundance, but not diversity, only in the first 3 years. In the last 2 years mowing effects became determinant. Flower cover and richness were the highest under the twice-a-year mowing regime. This regime also increased forage quantity and quality. Flower colour diversity was conversely the highest where mowing occurred every two years. Potassium in the soil decreased under the twice-a-year mowing regime. Other nutrients were not affected. No management option kept noxious weed to an acceptable level after 5 years. This supports the need to test the efficacy of specific management practices such as selective clipping or spraying. Mowing WS twice a year was retained as the most favourable treatment to maintain species-rich strips with an abundant flower provision. It however implies to mow in late June, i.e. at the peak of insect abundance. It is therefore suggested to keep an unmown refuge zone when applying this management regime.",Pharmacokinetic Properties of Humanized IgG1 and IgG4 Antibodies in Preclinical Species: Translational Evaluation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30868312,The AAPS journal,2019 05 10,"Assessment of the factors that regulate antibody exposure-response relationships in the relevant animal models is critical for the design of successful translational strategies from discovery to the clinic. Depending on the specific clinical indication, preclinical development paradigms may require that the efficacy or dosing-related attributes for the existing antibody be assessed in various species when cross-reactivity of the lead antibody to the intended species is justified. Additionally, with the success of monoclonal antibodies for management of various human conditions, a parallel interest in therapeutic use of these novel modalities in various veterinary species has followed. The protective role of neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) in regulation of IgG homeostasis and clearance is now well recognized and the ""nonspecific clearance"" of antibodies through bone marrow-derived phagocytic and vascular endothelial cells (via lysosomal processes) is modulated by interactions with FcRn receptors. In this study, we have attempted to examine the PK properties of human IgG antibodies in dog and monkey. These studies establish a translational framework for evaluation of IgG antibody PK properties across species."

However, limited literature shows the potential association between pharyngeal pooling and aspiration in head and neck cancer (HNC) patients. This study investigates the relationship between postswallow pharyngeal pooling and aspiration in HNC patients with oropharyngeal dysphagia. Furthermore, the effects of tumor stage, tumor location, and cancer treatment on aspiration were examined. Ninety dysphagic HNC patients underwent a standardized fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES) using thin and thick liquid boluses. For each swallow, three visuoperceptual ordinal variables were scored: postswallow vallecular pooling, postswallow pyriform sinus pooling, and aspiration. Logistic regression analyses with correction for the location of pooling, tumor stage, tumor location, and cancer treatment were performed to explore the association between pooling and aspiration. No significant association was found between postswallow vallecular pooling and aspiration for thin liquid. However, severe versus mild-to-moderate postswallow vallecular pooling of thick liquid was significantly associated to aspiration. Similar results were seen after correction for the presence of pyriform sinus pooling, tumor stage, tumor location, or type of cancer treatment. This study showed a significant association between severe postswallow pyriform sinus pooling of thick liquid and aspiration, independent of the presence of vallecular pooling, tumor stage, tumor location, or cancer treatment. Concluding, location (valleculae versus pyriform sinuses), liquid bolus consistency (thin versus thick liquid), and amount of postswallow pharyngeal pooling (no pooling, mild/moderate pooling, severe pooling) have an influence on the probability of aspiration in dysphagic HNC patients, and they should be carefully considered during FEES, even in the absence of aspiration during the examination.",Vascular tumors in infants and adolescents.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30868300,Insights into imaging,2019 04 07,"Malignant vascular tumors as part of the vascular anomalies spectrum are extremely rare in children and young adults. Instead, benign vascular neoplasias are frequently encountered in the pediatric patient population.

The appropriate differential diagnosis and nomenclature according to the classification of the International Society for the Study of Vascular Anomalies (ISSVA) is decisive to initiate correct therapy. While infantile hemangioma can be routinely diagnosed by clinical means and rarely require therapy, more rare vascular tumors are frequently difficult to diagnose, require dedicated cross-sectional imaging, and benefit from an interdisciplinary treatment approach.

This work aimed to develop a spray layering process to produce nonpareils by a side spray fluid bed with swirling air flow. The first part examined the effects of various parameters for producing lactose nonpareils by using Box-Behnken design. The factors considered were atomizing air pressure, spray rate, and fluidizing air temperature. This was followed by an in-depth investigation on the effects of inlet airflow rate, air temperature, and spray rate on properties of the product, in addition to process optimization. The results indicated a negative correlation between atomizing air pressure and D90 (particle size at 90th percentile in the cumulative undersize plot) as well as span (size distribution). Temperature had a positive correlation with D90 and span while spray rate affected span. Both atomizing air pressure and temperature correlated negatively with span. It was also found that spray rate negatively affected roundness at different coat weight gain levels across the study design space. Inlet airflow rate was found to correlate negatively with roundness at 15%, w/w coat weight gain. The mean useful yield of the optimized runs was about 91%. In the second part of this study, the metformin hydrochloride crystals as starter seeds were converted into nearly spherical shaped spheroids with 1:1 crystals to coat weight deposition over a processing time of about 3.5 h.

The clinicopathological characteristics of THSD7A-associated MN are poorly characterised due to low prevalence among MN patients. Among 469 consecutive cases of pathologically confirmed MN diagnosed at four centres in Japan, 14 cases were confirmed positive for THSD7A by immunohistochemistry (3.0%). The prevalence of THSD7A-associated MN tended to be higher in northern Japan. Most cases demonstrated nephrotic-range proteinuria (12/14 cases, 86%). In two patients, cancer was detected at the time of renal biopsy (small-cell carcinoma of the lung and prostatic adenocarcinoma with neuroendocrine differentiation). Both tumours were negative for THSD7A. Four patients had concurrent or previous incidence of allergic diseases, including one patient with Kimura's disease. Pathological analysis of kidney biopsy tissue revealed slight mesangial cell proliferation in three cases and spike formation in one case. Immunofluorescence studies demonstrated that IgG subclass was mainly IgG4-dominant/codominant (12/13, 92% cases), while the case with prostatic cancer had an IgG2-dominant distribution. The immunostaining profile for components of the lectin complement pathways was not significant in three cases including two patients with malignancy. One case was dual positive for THSD7A and PLA2R. Of 10 cases with known clinical follow-up data, 6 demonstrated reduced serum creatinine and 8 presented reduced proteinuria. In summary, although the major IgG phenotype was usually IgG4-dominant/codominant, clinical background was otherwise heterogeneous. Further investigation of regional differences in THSD7A-associated MN prevalence may reveal genetic and environmental risk factor and associated pathogenic mechanisms.","COPPS, a composite score integrating pathological features, PS100 and SDHB losses, predicts the risk of metastasis and progression-free survival in pheochromocytomas/paragangliomas.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30868297,Virchows Archiv : an international journal of pathology,2019 03 14,"Current histoprognostic parameters and prognostic scores used in paragangliomas and pheochromocytomas do not adequately predict the risk of metastastic progression and survival.

We compared also the performance of the COPPS with several presently used histoprognostic parameters in risk assessment of these tumors. A PASS score (Pheochromocytoma of the Adrenal gland Scaled Score) ≥ 6 was significantly associated with the occurrence of metastases (P < 0.0001) and shorter PFS (P = 0.013). In addition, both MCM6 and Ki-67 LI correlated with worse PFS (P = 0.004 and P < 0.0001, respectively), and MCM6, but not Ki-67, was significantly higher in metastatic group (P = 0.0004). Loss of PS100 staining correlated with the occurrence of metastasis (P < 0.0001) and shorter PFS (P < 0.0001). At a value of greater or equal to 3, the COPPS correlated with shorter PFS (P < 0.0001), and predicted reproducibly (weighted Kappa coefficient, 0.863) the occurrence of metastases with a sensitivity of 100.0% and specificity of 94.7%. It thus surpassed those found for either PASS, SDHB, MCM6, or Ki-67 alone. In conclusion, while validation is still necessary in independent confirmatory cohorts, COPPS could be of great potential for the risk assessment of metastasis and progression in paragangliomas and pheochromocytomas.",Antarctophthirus microchir infestation in synanthropic South American sea lion (Otaria flavescens) males diagnosed by a novel non-invasive method.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30868295,Parasitology research,2019 05 15,"Antarctophthirus microchir is a sucking louse species belonging to the family Echinophthiriidae and has been reported to parasitize all species of the subfamily Otariinae, the sea lions.

When it comes to molecular characterization, such studies are absent from India. The present communication reports the first characterization study of S. tenella from India. 18S rRNA ribosomal gene and mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (cox1) genes were used for molecular characterization and phylogenetic analysis alongside standard histopathology of sarcocysts. Five Indian isolates were characterized for each gene, and respective sequences were submitted in the NCBI. Two haplotypes were noticed, both for the 18S rRNA and cox1 gene showing 99.8-100.0% and 99.7-100.0% nucleotide homologies within themselves, respectively. When compared with other sequences of S. tenella across the globe, the present isolates showed 93.3-99.9% nucleotide homology based on 18S rRNA gene and 95.2-99.8% nucleotide homology based on cox1 gene, respectively. In both the 18S and cox1 phylogenetic trees, respective sequences of S. tenella were placed with monophyletic cluster which was sister to a cluster comprising of sequences of S. gracilis and S. alces.","Vector-borne pathogens affecting shelter dogs in eastern Crete, Greece.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30868293,Parasitology research,2019 05 15,"Canine pathogens transmitted by blood-sucking arthropods are of significant importance for veterinary and, in some cases, human health. However, they are still underestimated and rarely investigated in many parts of the Mediterranean region, mostly due to financial reasons. Therefore, in the present paper, we investigated the occurrence of blood-associated pathogens affecting dogs in Crete, Greece. For this purpose, blood samples from 103 shelter dogs were screened for the pathogens by PCR and serological tests. Overall, samples from 43 dogs scored positive for at least one pathogen (41.8%). In particular, antibodies to Leishmania infantum were detected in 26 dogs (25.2%), and 15 and 11 animals were positive for Hepatozoon canis (14.6%) and Mycoplasma haemocanis (10.7%) by PCR, respectively. Co-infections were recorded in nine animals. Clinical signs indicative of infection (alterations of skin or coat or reduced body condition) were detected in 10 animals, four of which were infected with one pathogen, three with two pathogens. Based on the results obtained, dogs from Crete appear to be frequently exposed to several blood-borne pathogens, including agents of zoonotic concern. Given that some of the pathogens were reported for the first time in this area, results presented in our study should improve the awareness of the local veterinarians and of dog rescue organisations in order to reduce disease burden on stray and owned dogs and to control the spread of canine vector-borne diseases from Greece to non-endemic areas by travelling or exported infected dogs.",Characterization of radiographers' mammography practice in five European countries: a pilot study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30868292,Insights into imaging,2019 04 07,"This pilot study aimed to characterize and compare radiographers' mammography practice, including quality control and continuous professional development in five European countries.","Pharmaceutical ""New Prior Knowledge"": Twenty-First Century Assurance of Therapeutic Equivalence.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30868291,AAPS PharmSciTech,2019 04 29,"Facilitating utility of prior knowledge to accelerate evidence-based new drug development is a focus of several communities of knowledge, such as clinical pharmacology.

Facilitating utility of prior ""Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls"" (CMC) knowledge to accelerate new drug development and regulatory review process is also a topic of significant interest. This paper focuses on facilitating the utility of prior pharmaceutical formulation knowledge to accelerate drug product development and regulatory review of generic and biosimilar products. This knowledge is described as New Prior Knowledge (NPK) because research is often needed to fill ontological (i.e., the domain of connectivity between concepts and phenomena), epistemological (i.e., distinguishing knowledge or justified belief from the opinion), and methodological gaps in information derived a decade or so ago. The corporate economic advantages of such knowledge are derived, in part, when significant portions remain a trade secret. The proposed NPK seeks to generate knowledge about critical aspects of pharmaceutical quality and failure modes to place it in the public domain and to facilitate accelerated and more confident development and regulatory review of generic products. The paradoxical combination of ""new"" and ""prior knowledge"" is chosen deliberately to highlight both a distinction from proprietary and trade secret information and to acknowledge certain historical dogmas inherent in the current practices. Considerations for operationalizing NPK are also summarized."

Taxonomic investigations revealed that it is a member of the B. subtilis subsp. subtilis group and very closely related with the reference type strain B. subtilis subsp. subtilis 168. The sequenced genome of strain SZMC 6179J contains the genes responsible for the synthesis of the extracellular antibiotics surfactin, fengycin and bacilysin. Compared to strain 168, a prophage-like region is missing from the genome of SZMC 6179J, while there are 106 single nucleotide polymorphisms and 23 deletion-insertion polymorphisms. The high biocontrol potential of strain SZMC 6179J may results from a single base deletion in the sfp gene encoding the transcription factor of the surfactin and fengycin operons. Hypermutated regions reflecting short-time evolutionary processes could be detected in SZMC 6179J. The deletion-insertion polymorphism in the sfp gene and the detected hypermutations can be suggested as genetic determinants of biocontrol features in B. subtilis.","Estimating long-term LULC changes in an agriculture-dominated basin using CORONA (1970) and LISS IV (2013-14) satellite images: a case study of Ramganga River, India.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30868267,Environmental monitoring and assessment,2019 04 20,"The basin of Ramganga River, a major tributary of Ganga, has seen rapid industrialization, urbanization, and agricultural growth in modern times, especially during and after the 1970s, with consequent changes in Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) of the basin.

Object-based classification using the eCognition software tool combined with manual classification of the images revealed significant decrease in total forest cover (~ 485 km2) and riverbed (~ 498 km2) LULC classes along with correspondingly increased agriculture (~ 898 km2) and built-up (~ 313 km2) classes in the basin. Further, though Ramganga reservoir (spread over ~ 70 km2), operated since in 1974, has increased the water area by ~ 1295% in Afzalgarh sub-basin of the Ramganga Basin, the overall area of water class decreased by 1.64% in the basin, probably due to loss of ponds in agricultural lands. An upward shift of about 42 km in the confluence point of Ramganga and Gangan Rivers was also observed, which may be attributed to the course shift of Ramganga in a south-west direction."

It belongs to the group of pemphigoid diseases and was first described in 1996. The diagnostic gold standard is the combination of (1) linear deposits of immunoreactants at the dermal epidermal junction by direct immunofluorescence microscopy of a perilesional skin biopsy, (2) detection of circulating autoantibodies binding to the dermal side (blister floor) of human salt split skin by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy, and reactivity with a 200 kDa protein (p200) in extract of human dermis by immunoblotting.

We developed a miniaturized optically accessible bioreactor (MOAB) allowing perfused culture of 3D cellularised constructs. In the MOAB, the culture chambers are sealed by magnets that generate a weak static magnetic field (SMF). Here, we predicted computationally the exact level of SMF to which cells are subjected during culture in the MOAB and we assessed its influence on the viability, metabolic activity and gene expression of neuroblastoma-derived cells cultured up to seven days. The predicted SMF ranged from 0.32 to 0.57 T using an axial-symmetric model of a single chamber, whereas it ranged from 0.35 to 0.62 T using a 3D model of the complete device. Cell function was evaluated in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells at 2 and 7 days of culture in the MOAB, compared to 2D monolayer, 3D non-perfused constructs, and 3D perfused constructs cultured in a modified MOAB with magnet-free sealing. We measured the cell metabolic activity normalized by the DNA content and the expression levels of heat-shock protein 70 (Hsp-70), Bcl-2 and Bax. We found that the level of SMF applied to cells in the MOAB did not influence their metabolic activity and exerted a stressful effect in 2D monolayer, not confirmed in 3D conditions, neither static not perfused. Instead, the magnets provided a significantly greater hydraulic sealing in long-term culture, thus the MOAB might be potentially exploitable for the development of reliable in vitro models of neurodegeneration.",[Rapid progressive glomerulonephritis].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30868251,Der Internist,2019 05 02,"The rapid progressive glomerulonephritis is an emergency case.

The GO-CNF was first modified by self-polymerization of dopamine which provided a platform for simultaneously self-assembly of the ATP aptamer and cysteine. By using hexacyanoferrate as the electrochemical probe, in the presence of ATP, the aptamer strands fold around ATP molecules, thus leading to the variation of the electrochemical signal. The aptasensor has a linear response in the 0.1 pM to 5 nM ATP concentration range, and a 13 fM lower detection limit. The electrode is strongly resistant to nonspecific adsorption and biofouling. This enabled the detection of ATP even in spiked human plasma.

The cationic doping of foreign ions at Na or V sites in the NVP lattice has proven to be an effective approach for enhancing the electrochemical performance of NVP. In this work, we present a first-principles density functional theory investigation of the impact of polyanionic boron doping at P sites on the structural and electrochemical behavior of NVP. Our simulation results suggest that B doping considerably increases the structural stability of NVP while shrinking its lattice size to some extent. Since B donates far fewer electrons to connected O atoms, the surrounding V atoms become more positive, causing the operating voltage to increase with B content. However, the reduction in lattice size is not beneficial for the Na+ transportation kinetics. As demonstrated by a search for the transition state, a concerted ion-exchange mechanism is preferred for Na+ transportation, and increased B doping leads to a higher Na+ diffusion barrier. Improvements in electrochemical performance due to B doping see (Hu et al. Adv Sci 3(12):1600112, 2016) appear to originate mainly from the resulting increased electrical conductivity.",Comparative measurements of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal responses to agricultural management practices.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30868248,Mycorrhiza,2019 05 05,"Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi are considered to be a key group of soil organisms for assessments of soil biological properties and developing relationships among crop production management practices, soil properties, crop performance, and ecosystem services. In a field study of cover crop treatments established during the transition from small grains to corn (Zea mays L), we assessed multiple measures of AM fungal responses to the management treatments: soil propagule numbers, biomass via lipid biomarkers, and root colonization extent. Our objectives were to determine response variables that reliably distinguished cover crop treatments and formed consistent relationships with grain yield, plant biomass, and mineral nutrient concentrations of the following corn crop. The number of soil AM fungal propagules and amount of the NLFA biomarker C16:1cis11 measured on fall-collected soils most consistently and significantly responded to fall cover crop treatments. Neither of these measures of soil inoculum potential was strongly related to measures of crop performance. The PLFA biomarker C16:1cis11 was marginally responsive to cover crop but did not strongly relate to crop performance parameters. Corn root colonization by AM fungi was not significantly affected by cover crop treatment, but significant negative relationships were found between root colonization and grain N concentration and plant biomass at maturity. In contrast, a significant positive relationship between root colonization and plant N concentration at the 6-leaf stage was found. Understanding the relative effectiveness and limitations of AM fungal response variables will inform their application in field studies of agricultural management practices.",Does maternal somatic anxiety in pregnancy predispose children to hyperactivity?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30868247,European child & adolescent psychiatry,2019 03 14,"The objective of this study is to explore the association between maternal somatic anxiety in pregnancy and hyperactivity symptoms and ADHD diagnosis in children.

The oxidation mechanism is currently ascribed to contact between the mineral and aqueous oxygen. Consequently, management of acidic leachate from acid sulfate soils and acid mine drainage is focused on the prevention of contact between the sediment and aqueous oxygen through the surface. Intriguing though is the fact that in aquatic sediments, redox processes occur in sequence with the oxidizing agents. Among the common oxidants in aquatic sediments are O2, [Formula: see text], Mn, and Fe, in the order of efficiency. Consequently, following the depletion of oxygen in pyrite-rich sediment, it would be expected that [Formula: see text], followed by Mn and then Fe, would continue the oxidation process. However, evidence of anaerobic pyrite oxidation in a naturally occurring pyrite-rich sediment is limited. Few studies have investigated the process in aquatic systems but mostly in laboratory experimental set ups. In this study, pyrite oxidation in a naturally occurring pyrite-rich sediment was investigated. A section of the sediment was covered with surface surcharge, in the form of compacted fill. The section of the sediment outside the surcharged area was preserved and used as control experiment. Solid phase soil and porewater samples were subjected to elemental, mineralogical, and microbial analyses. The results show excess accumulation of sulfate and sulfide in the anoxic zones of the original sediment and beneath the surcharge, accompanied by the disappearance of [Formula: see text], Mn, and Fe in the anoxic zones, indicating electron transfers between donors and acceptors, with pyrite as the most likely electron donor. The study outcome poses a significant challenge to the use of surface cover for the management of acidic leachate from pyrite oxidation, particularly, in areas rich in [Formula: see text], MnO-2, or Fe.",Integrated analysis of 8-week glecaprevir/pibrentasvir in Japanese and overseas patients without cirrhosis and with hepatitis C virus genotype 1 or 2 infection.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30868245,Journal of gastroenterology,2019 03 14,"Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection with genotypes (GT) 1 and 2 accounts for over 50% of HCV infections globally, including over 97% of all HCV infections in Japan.

Perception and discrimination of amino acids are, however, still poorly understood in bees (and insects in general). We used chemotactile conditioning of the proboscis extension response (PER) to examine (1) whether Bombus terrestris workers are able to perceive amino acids by means of their antennae and (if so) which ones, (2) whether they are able to differentiate between different amino acids, and (3) whether they are able to differentiate between different concentrations of the same amino acid. We found that workers perceived asparagine, cysteine, hydroxyproline, glutamic acid, lysine, phenylalanine, and serine, but not alanine, leucine, proline, or valine by means of their antennae. Surprisingly, they were unable to differentiate between different (perceivable) amino acids, but they distinguished between different concentrations of lysine. Consequently, bumblebees seem to possess amino acid receptors at the tip of their antennae, which enable a general perception of those solute amino acids that have an additional functional group (besides the common amino and carboxylic groups).

However, volatiles involved in fly attraction were until now identified in C. dolichophylla and C. sandersonii, only. We here present data on C. stenantha for which flower scent and pollinators were recently described, but volatiles involved in flower-fly communication stayed unknown.

Among these volatiles some were never described from any organism but C. stenantha. We synthesized these components, tested them on antennae of male and female flies, and confirmed their biological activity. Overall, our data show that half of the volatiles emitted from C. stenantha flowers are perceived by male and female fly pollinators and are potentially important for flower-fly communication in this pollination system.

The NLR and the PLR were significantly higher in all IgAV children and in the systemic involvement group in comparison with non-systemic. The MPR was significantly lower in all IgAV group with the exception of children without systemic involvement. The NLR is a more valuable indicator than the PLR to identify patients at higher risk of systemic involvement in the course of IgAV. Clinical usefulness of the MPR requires further research.","Biventricular myocardial strain analysis using cardiac magnetic resonance feature tracking (CMR-FT) in patients with distinct types of right ventricular diseases comparing arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC), right ventricular outflow-tract tachycardia (RVOT-VT), and Brugada syndrome (BrS).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30868222,Clinical research in cardiology : official journal of the German Cardiac Society,2019 03 14,"As underlying heart diseases of right ventricular tachyarrhythmias, ARVC causes wall-motion abnormalities based on fibrofatty myocardial degeneration, while RVOT-VT and BrS are thought to lack phenotypic MR characteristics.

In about one-third of cases, the joints are affected (psoriatic arthritis, PsA). Both conditions, especially PsA, profoundly impact patients' health-related quality of life (HRQoL). To describe the impact of psoriasis on HRQoL and patients' contact with the healthcare system in Sweden, Denmark, and Norway, the NORdic PAtient survey of Psoriasis and Psoriatic arthritis (NORPAPP) asked 22,050 adults randomly selected in Sweden, Denmark and Norway if they had psoriasis. 1264 individuals who reported physician-diagnosed PsO/PsA were invited to the full survey; 1221 responded (74.6% diagnosed with PsO alone; 25.4% with PsA ± PsO). Respondents with PsA most frequently consulted a rheumatologist; however, 14.3% had never seen a rheumatologist. Respondents with PsO alone most frequently consulted a general practitioner and 10.7% had never seen a dermatologist (although those with severe symptoms visited dermatologists more often). Negative impacts on HRQoL were reported by 38.1% of respondents with PsO [mostly limitations on clothing (22.6%), sleep disorders (16%), and depression/anxiety (16%)] and by 73% of respondents with PsA [mostly limitations on clothing (41.8%), sports/leisure (44.0%), or daily routine (45.1%) and sleeping disorders].

Pseudomonas protegens H78, which was isolated from the rape rhizosphere in Shanghai, can produce a large array of secondary metabolites, including antibiotics and siderophores. Plt is produced at low levels in the H78 wild-type strain. This study aimed to improve Plt production through combinatory genetic engineered strategies. Plt production was significantly enhanced (by14.3-fold) in the strain engineered by the following steps: (1) deletion of the translational repressor gene rsmE in the Gac/Rsm-RsmE pathway; (2) deletion of the ATP-dependent protease gene lon that encodes a potential enzyme that degrades positive regulators; (3) deletion of the negative regulatory gene pltZ of the Plt ABC-type transporter operon pltIJKNOP; (4) deletion of an inhibitory sequence within the operator of the transcriptional activator gene pltR; and (5) overexpression of the pltIJKNOP transport operon. The Plt production of the final engineered strain was increased to 214 from 15 μg ml-1 in the H78 wild-type strain.

Herein, we demonstrated that histidine-capped gold nanoclusters (His@AuNCs) possessed intrinsic oxidase-like activity, which could directly oxidize 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) to blue colored ox-TMB without H2O2. The assembly of reduced graphene oxide (RGO) with His@AuNCs could further improve its oxidase-like activity and the His@AuNCs/RGO nanocomposites had a lower Michaelis constant (Km) and higher catalytic constant (Kcat) for TMB oxidation. Furthermore, compared to other nanomaterials, the as-prepared His@AuNCs/RGO also exhibited enhanced electrocatalytic activity toward TMB. Interestingly, nitrite inhibited the catalytic (chromogenic) and electrocatalytic processes of His@AuNCs/RGO in the oxidation of TMB. The oxidase-like and electrocatalytic activity of His@AuNCs/RGO was evaluated with nitrite and TMB as substrates, and the results indicated that TMB and nitrite might share the same catalytic active sites. On the basis of these findings, a colorimetric and electrochemical sensor was developed with the His@AuNCs/RGO composite as an oxidase mimic for determination of nitrite with linear ranges of 10-500 μM and 2.5-5700 μM, respectively. The developed method was successfully applied to the detection of nitrites in real samples. The present work suggests that the oxidase-like nanozyme is not only suitable for colorimetric assay but also for development of electrochemical sensors in bioanalysis.

Numerous previous studies revealed that rare copy number variants (CNVs) play important roles in CHD, but little is known about the prevalence and role of rare CNVs in PA-IVS. In this study, we conducted a genome-wide scanning of rare CNVs in an unselected cohort consisted of 54 Chinese patients with PA-IVS and 20 patients with pulmonary atresia with ventricular septal defect (PA-VSD). CNVs were identified in 6/20 PA-VSD patients (30%), and three of these CNVs (15%) were considered potentially pathogenic. Two pathogenic CNVs occurred at a known CHD locus (22q11.2) and one likely pathogenic deletion located at 13q12.12. However, no rare CNVs were detected in patients with PA-IVS. Potentially pathogenic CNVs were more enriched in PA-VSD patients than in PA-IVS patients (p = 0.018). No rare CNVs were detected in patients with PA-IVS in our study.

Fibrin sealant [Tisseel®; n = 107, fibrin-only sealant (FS)] or gelatin matrix hemostatic sealant [FloSeal®; n = 51, gelatin matrix sealant (GS)] was applied during tract closure according to surgeon's preference. On the first postoperative day, computed tomography (CT) was scanned for all patients. Unsatisfactory radiological outcome (URO) was defined as any postoperative hematoma or urinoma (≥ 2 cm) on the CT. Unsatisfactory clinical outcome (UCO) was defined as any adverse event requiring additional intervention. Both UROs and UCOs were sub-classified as either hemorrhage or drainage related. 2:1 propensity score matching was applied according to clinical parameters. Median age was 58 (19-78) years and a mean stone size was 2.1 ± 1.1 cm. The treatment success rate (stone free or < 4 mm residual) among all patients was 91.1% (144/158). UROs and UCOs occurred in 35.4% (86/158) and 11.4% (18/158) of all cases, respectively. Neither of the frequency of URO nor hemorrhage-related UCO was different according to sealant type. However, drainage-related UCOs were more prevalent among the GS group, mainly due to the higher postoperative ureter stenting rate. The postoperative pain severity and the length of hospitalization were comparable between groups. In summary, using GS rather than FS during tract closure did not worsen hemorrhage-related outcomes. However, the clinical risk of ureter occlusion requiring additional temporary ureteral stenting was increased."

In this work, we develop a computational pipeline to confirm the spatial interaction relationship of the drugs and their targets and compare the drugs' efficacies based on the interaction centers. First, we produce a 100-sample set to reconstruct a stable docking model of the confirmed drug-target pairs. Second, we set 5.5 Å as the maximum distance threshold for the drug-amino acid residue atom interaction and construct 3-dimensional interaction surface models. Third, by calculating the spatial position of the 3-dimensional interaction surface center, we develop a comparison strategy for estimating the efficacy of different drug-target pairs. For the 1199 drug-target interactions of the 649 drugs and 355 targets, the drugs that have similar interaction center positions tend to have similar efficacies in disease treatment, especially in the analysis of the 37 targeted relationships between the 15 known anti-cancer drugs and 10 target molecules. Furthermore, the analysis of the unpaired anti-cancer drug and target molecules suggests that there is a potential application for discovering new drug actions using the sampling molecular docking and analyzing method.

In particular, precisely predicting drug response in specific cancer types and patients is still a challenge problem. Here we propose Meta-GDBP, a novel anticancer drug-response model, which involves two levels. At the first level of Meta-GDBP, we build four optimized base models (BMs) using genetic information, chemical properties and biological context with an ensemble optimization strategy, while at the second level, we construct a weighted model to integrate the four BMs. Notably, the weights of the models are learned upstream, thus the parameter cost is significantly reduced compared to previous methods. We evaluate the Meta-GDBP on Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) and the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) data sets. Benchmarking results demonstrate that compared to other methods, the Meta-GDBP achieves a much higher correlation between the predicted and the observed responses for almost all the drugs. Moreover, we apply the Meta-GDBP to predict the GDSC-missing drug response and use the CCLE-known data to validate the performance. The results show quite a similar tendency between these two response sets. Particularly, we here for the first time introduce a biological context-based frequency matrix (BCFM) to associate the biological context with the drug response. It is encouraging that the proposed BCFM is biologically meaningful and consistent with the reported biological mechanism, further demonstrating its efficacy for predicting drug response.

Primary sulfur assimilation provides the amino acid cysteine, which is utilized in protein synthesis and as a precursor for the cellular redox buffer glutathione. In contrast, the secondary sulfur metabolism pathway produces sulfated compounds such as glucosinolates and sulfated peptides, as well as a corresponding by-product 3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphate (PAP). Emerging evidence over the past decade has shown that secondary sulfur metabolism also has a crucial engagement during oxidative stress. This occurs across various cellular, tissue and organismal levels including chloroplast-to-nucleus retrograde signalling events mediated by PAP, modulation of hormonal signalling by sulfated compounds and PAP, control of physiological responses such as stomatal closure, and potential regulation of plant growth. In this review, we examine the contribution of the different components of plant secondary metabolism to oxidative stress homeostasis, and how this pathway is metabolically regulated. We further outline the key outstanding questions in the field that are necessary to understand how and why this 'specialized' metabolic pathway plays significant roles in plant oxidative stress tolerance.",NO in plants: pro or anti senescence.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30868162,Journal of experimental botany,2019 03 14,"Senescence is a regulated process of tissue degeneration which concerns any plant organ and consists in the degradation and remobilization of molecules to other growing tissues. Senescent organs display microscopic changes as well as internal cellular structure modifications and differential gene expression. A large number of factors influencing senescence have been described including age, nutrient supply and environmental interactions. Internal factors such as phytohormones also affect the timing of leaf senescence. A link between the senescence process and nitric oxide (NO) production in senescing tissues has been noticed for many years. Astonishingly, this link proves to be either a positive or a negative correlation depending upon the organ.

These regulatory mechanisms coordinate the cellular sulfhydryl supply in particular with carbon and nitrogen assimilation. Redox homeostasis is an important cellular parameter intimately connected to sulfur by means of multiple thiol modifications. Posttranslational thiol modifications such as disulfide formation, sulfenylation, S-nitrosylation, persulfidation and S-glutathionylation allow for versatile switching and adjustment of protein functions. This update focuses on redox-regulation of enzymes involved in the sulfur assimilation pathway, i.e. adenosine 5`phosphosulfate reductase (APR), adenosine 5'-phosphosulfate kinase (APSK) and y-glutamylcysteine ligase (GCL). The activity of these enzymes is adjusted at the transcriptional and posttranslational level in dependence on physiological requirements and the state of the redox and reactive oxygen species network which is tightly linked to abiotic stress conditions. Hormone-dependent fine tuning contributes to regulation of sulfur assimilation. Thus the link between oxylipin signalling and sulfur assimilation was substantiated by identification of the so called COPS module in the chloroplast with its components cyclophilin 20-3, O-acetylserine thiol lyase, 2-cysteine peroxiredoxin and serine acetyl transferase. A detailed understanding of regulation has emerged which realises the fine-tuned adjustment of sulfur assimilation both under regular and abiotic stress conditions.","The use of inulin and wheat bran only during the starter period or during the entire rearing life of broilers: effects on growth performance, small intestinal maturation, and cecal microbial colonization until slaughter age.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30868160,Poultry science,2019 03 14,"Inulin and wheat bran were added to broiler diets during the starter period or during the entire rearing period to investigate whether the effects of using these ingredients remained until slaughter age. Diets containing no inulin and no wheat bran (CON), 2% inulin (IN), 10% wheat bran (WB), or 2% inulin + 10% wheat bran (IN+WB) were provided until day 11. Thereafter, each dietary treatment was further divided into a continued diet with supplementation or a control diet, resulting in 7 groups (CON, IN/IN, IN/CON, WB/WB, WB/CON, IN+WB/IN+WB, or IN+WB/CON). On day 40, 12 chickens per group were euthanized. The IN/IN group increased the cecal molar ratio of butyrate but had a lower relative abundance of Lactobacillus (P < 0.05). Additionally, the cecal molar ratio of propionate was higher in the IN/CON group compared to the IN/IN group (P = 0.034). The WB/CON group had the best results on BW and feed conversion ratio (FCR) (P < 0.05). Only the cecal molar ratio of iso-butyrate was higher in the WB/WB group (P = 0.013). Moreover, compared to the CON group, both WB/WB and WB/CON groups reduced the relative abundances of Bifidobacterium and Escherichia coli, and only the WB/WB group reduced the relative abundance of Enterobacteriaceae (P < 0.05). Both IN+WB/IN+WB and IN+WB/CON groups increased BW until day 21 and lowered the relative abundance of Bifidobacterium (P < 0.05). The IN+WB/IN+WB group increased the cecal molar ratio of butyrate but reduced the molar ratio of propionate with a higher relative abundance of Enterobacteriaceae (P < 0.05).

MLMI (Workshop),2019 03 29,"Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has been widely applied to analysis and diagnosis of brain diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its prodrome, i.e., mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Traditional methods usually construct connectivity networks (CNs) by simply calculating Pearson correlation coefficients (PCCs) between time series of brain regions, and then extract low-level network measures as features to train the learning model. However, the valuable observation information in network construction (e.g., specific contributions of different time points) and high-level (i.e., high-order) network properties are neglected in these methods. In this paper, we first define a novel weighted correlation kernel (called wc-kernel) to measure the correlation of brain regions, by which weighting factors are determined in a data-driven manner to characterize the contribution of each time point, thus conveying the richer interaction information of brain regions compared with the PCC method. Furthermore, we propose a wc-kernel based convolutional neural network (CNN) (called wck-CNN) framework for extracting the hierarchical (i.e., from low-order to high-order) functional connectivities for disease diagnosis, by using fMRI data. Specifically, we first define a layer to build dynamic CNs (DCNs) using the defined wc-kernels. Then, we define three layers to extract local (region specific), global (network specific) and temporal high-order properties from the constructed low-order functional connectivities as features for classification. Results on 174 subjects (a total of 563 scans) with rs-fMRI data from ADNI suggest that the our method can not only improve the performance compared with state-of-the-art methods, but also provide novel insights into the interaction patterns of brain activities and their changes in diseases.",DREADD Agonist 21 Is an Effective Agonist for Muscarinic-Based DREADDs in Vitro and in Vivo.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30868140,ACS pharmacology & translational science,2019 03 29,"Chemogenetic tools such as designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs) are routinely used to modulate neuronal and non-neuronal signaling and activity in a relatively noninvasive manner. The first generation of DREADDs were templated from the human muscarinic acetylcholine receptor family and are relatively insensitive to the endogenous agonist acetylcholine but instead are activated by clozapine-N-oxide (CNO). Despite the undisputed success of CNO as an activator of muscarinic DREADDs, it has been known for some time that CNO is subject to a low rate of metabolic conversion to clozapine, raising the need for alternative chemical actuators of muscarinic-based DREADDs. Here we show that DREADD agonist 21 (C21) (11-(1-piperazinyl)-5H-dibenzo[b,e][1,4]diazepine) is a potent and selective agonist at both excitatory (hM3Dq) and inhibitory (hM4Di) DREADDs and has excellent bioavailability, pharmacokinetic properties, and brain penetrability. We also show that C21-induced activation of hM3Dq and hM4Di in vivo can modulate bidirectional feeding in defined circuits in mice. These results indicate that C21 represents an alternative to CNO for in vivo studies where metabolic conversion of CNO to clozapine is a concern.",Explaining the Relationship Between Minority Group Status and Health Disparities: A Review of Selected Concepts.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30868139,Health equity,2019 03 29,"Purpose: There is growing concern that value-based payment for health care may disadvantage health care organizations that serve populations with social risk. In the broader investigation of social risk factors, including income, education, neighborhood deprivation, and other risks, the focus on race and ethnicity as a risk factor for disparities in health and health care has diminished. Understanding the independent contribution of minority group status is critical to this discussion. This narrative review discusses four concepts-minority stress, resilience, epigenetics, and life course-that may help explain the contribution of minority group status and its association with health disparities. Methods: We briefly describe each concept and the supporting evidence. Results: Our results indicate that all four concepts have potential relevance for understanding and addressing health disparities. The life course perspective emphasizes the importance of understanding explanatory mechanisms and factors that contribute to health-including biological, physical, and social factors-over a person's life span. Both minority stress and resilience may influence health in either a negative or positive manner that potentially underlies health changes. Exposure to these factors and others may interact with and modify epigenetic regulation-biological processes that impact how our genes are expressed. This may increase the risk of disease and negative health outcomes, particularly among groups that may be at disproportionate risk because of social circumstances and environmental exposure over the life course. Conclusion: Despite these concepts' relevance, more research is needed to assess how they may explain the relationship between minority status and disparities in health. Such evidence is needed to focus interventions and to inform the design of delivery and payment models that can spur actions to reduce disparities.",Potential use of leukocytosis and anion gap elevation in differentiating psychogenic nonepileptic seizures from epileptic seizures.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30868134,Epilepsia open,2019 03 29,"Epileptic seizures (ES) and psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES) can be difficult to differentiate from each other in the emergency department (ED) setting. We have previously shown that the anion gap (AG) can help differentiate between ES and PNES in the ED. In this study, we explored whether additionally considering leukocytosis can help better differentiate between ES and PNES. We screened a total of 1354 subjects seen in the ED of a tertiary care medical center; 27 PNES and 27 ES patients were identified based on clinical description and subsequent electroencephalography (EEG). Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to model the association between ES, leukocytosis, and AG. Our results indicated that within 9 hours after the index event, serum AG (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2.07) and white blood cell (WBC) count (aOR 1.61) were both independently associated with ES. We derived an equation to help differentiate between ES and PNES: 1.5*AG+WBC. A score >24.8 indicated a >90% likelihood of ES. A score <15.5 indicated a <10% likelihood of ES (ie, the alternate diagnosis of PNES should be considered). This study for the first time provides evidence to help differentiate PNES and ES utilizing acidosis and leukocytosis.",Development of temporal lobe epilepsy during maintenance electroconvulsive therapy: A case of human kindling?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30868132,Epilepsia open,2019 03 29,We describe a patient with new-onset temporal lobe epilepsy during prolonged maintenance electroconvulsive therapy. We suggest a possible causal relationship with maintenance electroconvulsive therapy through electrical kindling of the temporal lobe.,Dietary intervention for canine epilepsy: Two case reports.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30868131,Epilepsia open,2019 03 29,"Epilepsy is a common neurologic disorder in humans and domesticated canines. In both species the etiology is diverse and complex, and even with medication a significant portion of the population does not experience sufficient seizure control and/or has unacceptable side effects. Humans often try alternatives such as dietary therapy or brain surgery, but in dogs, brain surgery is rarely an option and, despite potential benefits, there are no standard recommendations for a dietary approach. Herein we describe 2 retrospective case studies detailing the effects of homemade diets prepared for dogs with uncontrolled epileptic seizures and/or toxic side effects of medication. Basic recipes are provided for each formula-a high-fat ""ketogenic"" diet and a partial ""whole food"" diet. Carbohydrate content was reduced or controlled, and in one case this was proven to be essential for seizure control: ingesting carbohydrates would reverse the benefits of the diet and precipitate a seizure. Both dogs experienced fewer seizures and side effects when eating these modified diets compared to when they were administered antiepileptic drugs, including complete cessation of seizures for extended periods. Practical advantages and success of these homemade dietary interventions highlight the potential for diet-based metabolic therapy as a treatment option for seizures not only in humans but also in dogs.",Responsive neurostimulation targeting the anterior nucleus of the thalamus in 3 patients with treatment-resistant multifocal epilepsy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30868130,Epilepsia open,2019 03 29,"Electrical stimulation in the anterior nucleus of the thalamus (ANT) has previously been found to be efficacious for reducing seizure frequency in patients with epilepsy. Bilateral deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the ANT is an open-loop system that can be used in the management of treatment-resistant epilepsy. In contrast, the responsive neurostimulation (RNS) system is a closed-loop device that delivers treatment in response to prespecified electrocorticographic triggers. The efficacy and safety of RNS targeting the ANT is unknown. We describe 3 patients with treatment-resistant multifocal epilepsy who were implanted with an RNS system, which included unilateral stimulation of the ANT. After >33 months of follow-up, there were no adverse effects on mood, memory or behavior. Two patients had ≥50% reduction in disabling seizures and one patient had a 50% reduction compared to pretreatment baseline. Although reduction in seizure frequency has been modest to date, these findings support responsive neurostimulation of the ANT as feasible, safe, and well-tolerated. Further studies are needed to determine optimal stimulation parameters.",Prevalence of adult epilepsy in a general Japanese population: The Hisayama study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30868129,Epilepsia open,2019 03 29,"The aim of the present study was to examine the prevalence and causes of adult epilepsy in a general Japanese population. We examined a total of 3333 Japanese residents in the town of Hisayama aged ≥40 years in 2012-2013. The examination was performed mainly at the municipal center for health promotion, but some subjects were examined in their homes, hospitals, or nursing homes. Twenty-three subjects had a diagnosis of epilepsy. The prevalence (95% confidence interval [CI]) of epilepsy per 1000 was 6.9 (4.1-9.7) in total, 4.9 (1.3-8.5) in men, and 8.4 (4.3-12.5) in women (P = 0.23 between sexes). The prevalence of epilepsy was significantly higher in the elderly (aged ≥65 years; 10.3 per 1000 [95% CI 5.4-15.1]) than in the middle-aged (aged 40-64 years; 3.6 per 1000 [95% CI 0.7-6.4]; P = 0.02). The major cause of epilepsy was cerebrovascular diseases (n = 11; 48% of the epilepsy patients). More than half of the epilepsy patients experienced the first episode of seizure in older age (≥65 years; n = 13; 57%). The findings of this study suggest the clinical importance of the prevention of cerebrovascular diseases to reduce the burden of epilepsy in the future.",Epilepsy at different ages-Etiologies in a Norwegian population.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30868128,Epilepsia open,2019 03 29,"The causes of epilepsy are age related, but confirmative data from population-based studies are scarce. Our aim was to describe the typical causes of epilepsy in the different age groups of a defined population. The study was cross-sectional, based on a review of all medical files containing a diagnostic code for epilepsy at Drammen Hospital from 1999-2013. Drammen Hospital serves the population of Buskerud County, with 272 228 residents (as of January 1, 2014), including 1771 people with active epilepsy. This group of persons with active epilepsy was divided into different age groups with the causes of epilepsy mapped in each group. The proportion with unknown etiology ranged from 27% (age 5-9) to 41% (age 10-19). Structural-metabolic epilepsy and perinatal insults were the leading causes of epilepsy in the age group 5-9 (46%), whereas disturbances of brain development dominated in the youngest (23% in patients ≤4 years old). In the group comprising persons with epilepsy ≥60 years old, stroke was the most common cause of epilepsy (44%). Despite recent advances in research and technology, a large number of patients in all age groups (including the youngest) still have an unknown cause of epilepsy. We conclude that an effort must be made to improve the diagnostics for and understanding of the causes of epilepsy across all ages.",Long-term seizure outcome after epilepsy surgery in patients with mild malformation of cortical development and focal cortical dysplasia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30868127,Epilepsia open,2019 03 29,"Focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) and mild malformation of cortical development (mMCD) are frequent histopathologic diagnoses in patients who undergo surgery for refractory epilepsy. Literature concerning surgical outcome in patients with mMCD, as well as its contrast with FCD, has been scarce. We studied 88 patients with a histopathologic diagnosis of isolated FCD (n = 57) or mMCD (n = 31), revised according to the latest International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) guidelines, who underwent resective or disconnective surgery. Our findings suggest differences between mMCD and FCD in clinical presentation and surgical outcome after surgery. Patients with mMCD developed seizures later in life, and their lesions had a predilection for location in the temporal lobe and remained undetected by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) more frequently. A diagnosis of mMCD has a less favorable surgical outcome. Still, 32% of these patients reached continuous seizure freedom (Engel class 1A) at a latest median follow-up duration of 8 years, compared to 59% in FCD. A histopathologic diagnosis of mMCD, extratemporal surgery, and indication of an incomplete resection each were independent predictors of poor outcome."

Meningeal lymphatic vessels along dural sinuses and main nerves contribute to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drainage, integrating the cerebrovascular and periventricular routes, and forming a circuit that we here define as the CNS-lymphatic unit. The latter unit is important for parenchymal waste clearance, brain homeostasis, and the regulation of immune or inflammatory processes within the brain. Disruption of fluid drain mechanisms may promote or sustain CNS disease, conceivably applicable to epilepsy where extracellular accumulation of macromolecules and metabolic by-products occur in the interstitial and perivascular spaces. Herein we address an emerging concept and propose a theoretical framework on: (a) how a defect of brain clearance of macromolecules could favor neuronal hyperexcitability and seizures, and (b) whether meningeal lymphatic vessel dysfunction contributes to the neuroimmune cross-talk in epileptic pathophysiology. We propose possible molecular interventions targeting meningeal lymphatic dysfunctions, a potential target for immune-mediated epilepsy.",Neonatal seizures: Is there a relationship between ictal electroclinical features and etiology? A critical appraisal based on a systematic literature review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30868112,Epilepsia open,2019 03 29,"The aim of this study was to evaluate whether specific etiologies of neonatal seizures have distinct ictal electroclinical features. A systematic review of English articles using the PubMed database since 2004 (last update 9/26/16). Search terms included text words and Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms related to neonatal seizures. Eligible articles included reports of neonates with seizures with a full description of seizure semiology and electroclinical findings. Independent extraction of data was performed by 2 authors using predefined data fields, including study quality indicators. Data were collected for every individual patient described in the articles. The dataset was analyzed with the Fisher exact test. The initial search led to 8507 titles; using filters, 2910 titles and abstracts were identified, with 177 full texts selected to be read. Fifty-seven studies were included in the analysis with 151 neonates (37.7 male and 62.9% term). Genetic etiologies (51%) and sequential seizures (41.1%) predominated in this sample and hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) accounted for only 4%. The low prevalence of HIE observed was probably due to a publication bias. A significant association was found between etiology and seizure type: hemorrhage with autonomic seizures (P = 0.003), central nervous system (CNS) infection and stroke with clonic seizures (P = 0.042, P < 0.001, respectively), metabolic/vitamin-related disorders, and inborn errors of metabolism with myoclonic seizures (P < 0.001). There were also specific electroencephalography (EEG) patterns seen with certain etiologies: vascular disorders and electrolyte imbalance with focal ictal discharges (P < 0.001, P = 0.049 respectively), vitamin-related disorders with multifocal (P = 0.003), and all categories of genetic disorders with burst-suppression (P < 0.001). Clonic and autonomic seizures were more frequently present with focal EEG abnormalities (P = 0.001 and P < 0.001), whereas tonic and myoclonic seizures present with burst-suppression (P = 0.001, P = 0.005). In conclusion, our data suggest that specific associations of etiologies of neonatal seizures with distinct clinical features and EEG patterns might help in the decision to establish appropriate treatment.",Metal-Assisted and Microwave-Accelerated Decrystallization of Pseudo-Tophus in Synthetic Human Joint Models.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30868110,ACS omega,2019 03 29,"In this paper, we tested a hypothesis that the metal-assisted and microwave-accelerated decrystallization (MAMAD) technique, based on the combined use of low-power medical microwave heating (MWH) and gold nanoparticles (Au NPs), can be used to decrystallize laboratory-prepared monosodium urate monohydrate crystal aggregate (pseudo-tophus) placed in three-dimensional (3D) synthetic human joint models. To simulate a potential treatment of chronic tophaceous gout using the MAMAD technique, we used three different 3D synthetic human joint models and assessed the percent mass reduction (PMR, i.e., decrystallization) of pseudo-tophus and microwave-induced synthetic skin patch damage after MAMAD sessions (a MAMAD session = 120 s of MWH in the presence of Au NPs). Our three synthetic joint models are: Model 1: Application of seven MAMAD sessions in a closed synthetic joint with a pseudo-bursa containing a pseudo-tophus submerged in a solution of 20 nm Au NPs followed by dehydration of pseudo-tophus after each MAMAD session to assess PMR. Model 2: Application of seven MAMAD sessions in a closed or open synthetic joint with a pseudo-bursa containing a pseudo-tophus submerged in a solution of Au NPs followed by intermittent dehydration of pseudo-tophus after seven MAMAD sessions to assess PMR. Model 3: Application of 18 MAMAD sessions in a rotated closed synthetic joint (three sides are heated separately) with a pseudo-bursa containing a pseudo-tophus submerged in a solution of Au NPs followed by dehydration after every three MAMAD sessions to assess PMR. After a single MAMAD session, pseudo-tophus exposed to MWH and Au NPs had an average PMR of 8.30% (up to an overall PMR of 15%), and microwave-induced damage to the synthetic skin can be controlled by the use of a sacrificial skin sample and by adjusting the duration and the number of the MAMAD sessions. Computational electromagnetic simulations predict a 10% absorption of electric field by the pseudo-tophus placed in the synthetic joint models, which led us to conclude that a medical microwave source with higher power than 20 W can potentially be used with the MAMAD technique.",Sleep and circadian defects in a Drosophila model of mitochondrial encephalomyopathy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30868108,Neurobiology of sleep and circadian rhythms,2019 03 29,"Mitochondrial encephalomyopathies (ME) are complex, incurable diseases characterized by severe bioenergetic distress that can affect the function of all major organ systems but is especially taxing to neuromuscular tissues. Animal models of MEs are rare, but the Drosophila ATP61 mutant is a stable, well-characterized genetic line that accurately models progressive human mitochondrial diseases such as Maternally-Inherited Leigh Syndrome (MILS), Neuropathy, Ataxia, and Retinitis Pigmentosa (NARP), and Familial Bilateral Striatal Necrosis (FBSN). While it is established that this model exhibits important hallmarks of ME, including excess cellular and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species, shortened lifespan, muscle degeneration, and stress-induced seizures, it is unknown whether it exhibits defects in sleep or circadian function. This is a clinically relevant question, as many neurological and neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by such disturbances, which can exacerbate other symptoms and worsen quality of life. Since Drosophila is highly amenable to sleep and circadian studies, we asked whether we could detect disease phenotypes in the circadian behaviors of ATP61 . Indeed, we found that day-time and night-time activity and sleep are altered through disease progression, and that circadian patterns are disrupted at both the behavioral and neuronal levels. These results establish ATP61 as an important model of sleep and circadian disruption in ME that can be studied mechanistically at the molecular, cellular, and behavioral level to uncover underlying pathophysiology and test novel therapies.",Developing and adopting safe and effective digital biomarkers to improve patient outcomes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30868107,NPJ digital medicine,2019 03 29,"Biomarkers are physiologic, pathologic, or anatomic characteristics that are objectively measured and evaluated as an indicator of normal biologic processes, pathologic processes, or biological responses to therapeutic interventions. Recent advances in the development of mobile digitally connected technologies have led to the emergence of a new class of biomarkers measured across multiple layers of hardware and software. Quantified in ones and zeros, these ""digital"" biomarkers can support continuous measurements outside the physical confines of the clinical environment. The modular software-hardware combination of these products has created new opportunities for patient care and biomedical research, enabling remote monitoring and decentralized clinical trial designs. However, a systematic approach to assessing the quality and utility of digital biomarkers to ensure an appropriate balance between their safety and effectiveness is needed. This paper outlines key considerations for the development and evaluation of digital biomarkers, examining their role in clinical research and routine patient care.",The Thalamus Regulates Retinoic Acid Signaling and Development of Parvalbumin Interneurons in Postnatal Mouse Prefrontal Cortex.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30868103,eNeuro,2019 05 21,"GABAergic inhibitory neurons in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) play crucial roles in higher cognitive functions. Despite the link between aberrant development of PFC interneurons and a number of psychiatric disorders, mechanisms underlying the development of these neurons are poorly understood. Here we show that the retinoic acid (RA)-degrading enzyme CYP26B1 (cytochrome P450 family 26, subfamily B, member 1) is transiently expressed in the mouse frontal cortex during postnatal development, and that medial ganglionic eminence (MGE)-derived interneurons, particularly in parvalbumin (PV)-expressing neurons, are the main cell type that has active RA signaling during this period. We found that frontal cortex-specific Cyp26b1 knock-out mice had an increased density of PV-expressing, but not somatostatin-expressing, interneurons in medial PFC, indicating a novel role of RA signaling in controlling PV neuron development. The initiation of Cyp26b1 expression in neonatal PFC coincides with the establishment of connections between the thalamus and the PFC. We found that these connections are required for the postnatal expression of Cyp26b1 in medial PFC. In addition to this region-specific role in postnatal PFC that regulates RA signaling and PV neuron development, the thalamocortical connectivity had an earlier role in controlling radial dispersion of MGE-derived interneurons throughout embryonic neocortex. In summary, our results suggest that the thalamus plays multiple, temporally separate roles in interneuron development in the PFC.",How Do I Confirm that a New Mutation is Pathogenic?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30868102,Movement disorders clinical practice,2019 03 14,"Whole exome, genome sequencing, and other massive parallel next generation sequencing technologies have increasingly been used as a clinical diagnostic tool in recent years. Although sequencing technologies are becoming more affordable and widely used, the interpretation of variants from these large datasets at the level of personalized medicine is not clear-cut. For example, many rare missense variants identified may or may not have an impact on gene function and can be problematic to interpret in a clinical setting. Thus, there is a need for a systematic approach to applying, reporting, and evaluating variants identified. One important aspect is to determine the pathogenicity of a variant based on scientific literature. This tutorial is meant to serve as an introduction to scoring pathogenicity of variants, enabling movement disorder specialists to familiarize themselves with online tools to independently determine pathogenicity of variants identified in genetic testing reports."

Pathogens are primarily removed by direct opsonisation following the recognition of cell surface carbohydrates and other immunostimulatory molecules or via the activation of the lectin complement pathway, which results in the deposition of C3b and the recruitment of phagocytes. In recent years, there have been a number of studies implicating ficolins in the recognition and removal of numerous bacterial, viral, fungal, and parasitic pathogens. Moreover, there has been expanding evidence highlighting that mutations within these key immune proteins, or the possession of particular haplotypes, enhance susceptibility to colonization by pathogens and dysfunctional immune responses. This review will therefore encompass previous knowledge on the role of ficolins in the recognition of bacterial and viral pathogens, while acknowledging the recent advances in the immune response to fungal and parasitic infections. Additionally, we will explore the various genetic susceptibility factors that predispose individuals to infection.",Inflammation and Kidney Injury in Diabetic African American Men.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30868076,Journal of diabetes research,2019 06 10,"African Americans are disproportionately burdened by diabetic kidney disease (DKD). However, little is known about the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the onset and progression of DKD in this population. The goal of the current study was to determine the association between specific inflammation markers and kidney injury in diabetic African American men. To this end, we recruited diabetic patients either with (n = 20) or without (n = 87) diagnosed kidney disease along with age-matched nondiabetic controls (n = 81). Urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratios (UACRs) and estimated glomerular filtration rates (eGFR) were used for biochemical assessment of kidney function. We then measured plasma and urinary levels of seven inflammatory markers, including adiponectin, C-reactive protein (CRP), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1), TNF receptor 2 (TNFR2), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1). Plasma levels of TNF-α, TNFR1, and TNFR2 were significantly higher in diabetics with macroalbuminuria compared to nondiabetic controls and diabetics with normoalbuminuria or microalbuminuria. Likewise, urinary levels of ICAM-1 were higher in diabetics with macroalbuminuria compared to the other groups. Indeed, urinary ICAM-1, plasma TNF-α, and adiponectin had moderate positive correlations with UACR while plasma TNFR1 and TNFR2 levels were strongly correlated with kidney injury, indicated by multiple biomarkers of kidney injury. In contrast, though plasma CRP was elevated in diabetic subjects relative to nondiabetic controls, its levels did not correlate with kidney injury. Together, these data suggest that inflammation, particularly that mediated by the TNF-α/NF-κB signaling axis, may play a role in the pathogenesis of DKD in African American men.",Accumulation of Astaxanthin Was Improved by the Nonmotile Cells of Haematococcus pluvialis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30868075,BioMed research international,2019 03 29,"The current commercial production of natural astaxanthin is mainly carried out using Haematococcus pluvialis vegetative cells in the ""two-stage"" batch mode.

In this study, we compared the differences between motile cells and nonmotile cells in astaxanthin productivity, morphological changes, the mortality rate, and the diameter of the formed cysts. The experimental design was achieved by two different types H. pluvialis cell under continuous light of 80 μmol photons m-2 s-1 for a 9-day induction period. The highest astaxanthin concentration of 48.42 ± 3.13 mg L-1 was obtained in the nonmotile cell cultures with the highest the productivity of 5.04 ± 0.15 mg L-1 day-1, which was significantly higher than that in the motile cell cultures. The microscopic examination of cell morphological showed a large number of photooxidative damaged cells occurring in the motile cell cultures, resulting in higher cell mortality rate (22.2 ± 3.97%) than nonmotile cell cultures (9.6 ± 0.63%). In addition, the analysis results of cell diameter statistics indicated that nonmotile cells were more conducive to the formation of large astaxanthin-rich cysts than motile cells. In conclusion, the works presented here suggest that the accumulation of astaxanthin was significantly improved by nonmotile cells of H. pluvialis, which provided a possibility of optimizing the existing H. pluvialis cultivation strategy for the industrial production.","Macrophage Migration Inhibitory Factor Levels in Gingival Crevicular Fluid, Saliva, and Serum of Chronic Periodontitis Patients.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30868074,BioMed research international,2019 03 29,"Chronic periodontitis (CP) is an infection that affects the teeth supporting structure. Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is an important effector cytokine of the innate immune system. Due to its functional characteristics, MIF may be involved in the immunopathology of CP. The aim of the present study was to evaluate MIF levels in gingival crevicular fluid (GCF), saliva, and serum of CP patients. A cross-sectional study was conducted on 60 subjects divided into two groups: subjects with CP (n= 30) and periodontally healthy subjects without CP (n=30). MIF was quantified in GCF, saliva, and serum of all participants by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. MIF concentrations were higher in GCF, saliva, and serum in the group with CP compared with the group without CP and a higher MIF concentration was observed in GCF (p=0.001) and saliva (p=0.009) in the group with CP. MIF intragroup comparisons between fluids demonstrated significant high levels of MIF in saliva compared with GCF and serum in both study groups (p<0.05). A positive correlation was found between clinical signs and MIF concentration in GCF (p<0.05). There is an association between the MIF and the clinical signs of the disease. Therefore, MIF could have an important role in the pathology and progression of CP.",Determination of Haematological Reference Ranges in Healthy Adults in Three Regions in Ghana.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30868073,BioMed research international,2019 03 29,"Laboratory results interpretation for diagnostic accuracy and clinical decision-making in this period of evidence-based medicine requires cut-off values or reference ranges that are reflective of the geographical area where the individual resides. Several studies have shown significant differences between and within populations, emphasizing the need for population-specific reference ranges. This cross-sectional experimental study sought to establish the haematological reference values in apparently healthy individuals in three regions in Ghana. Study sites included Nkenkaasu, Winneba, and Nadowli in the Ashanti, Central, and Upper West regions of Ghana, respectively. A total of 488 healthy participants were recruited using the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (United States National Consensus Committee on Laboratory Standards, NCCLS) Guidance Document C28A2. Medians for haematological parameters were calculated and reference values determined at 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles and compared with Caucasian values adopted by our laboratory as reference ranges and values from other African and Western countries. RBC count, haemoglobin, and haematocrit (HCT) were significantly higher in males compared to females. There were significant intraregional and interregional as well as international variations of haematological reference ranges in the populations studied. We conclude that, for each geographical area, there is a need to establish geography-specific reference ranges if accurate diagnosis and concise clinical decisions are to be made.","Synthesis, Characterization, and Application of Poly(4,4'-Cyclohexylidene Bisphenol Oxalate) for Solid-Phase Extraction of DNA.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30868072,BioMed research international,2019 03 29,"The present study has synthesized poly(4,4'-cyclohexylidene bisphenol oxalate) by the condensation of oxalyl chloride with 4,4'-cyclohexylidene bisphenol, where its efficacy was tested for the solid-phase extraction of DNA. The synthesized polymer in the form of a white powder was characterized by FTIR, TGA-DTG, SEM, and BET analysis. The study utilized solid-phase application of the resulting polymer to extract DNA. The analysis of results provided the information that the extraction efficiency is a strong dependent of polymer amount and binding buffer type. Among the three types of buffers tested, the GuHCl buffer produced the most satisfactory results in terms of yield and efficiency of extraction. Moreover, the absorbance ratio of A260/A280 in all of the samples varied from 1.682 to 1.491, thereby confirming the capability of poly(4,4'-cyclohexylidene bisphenol oxalate) to elute pure DNA. The results demonstrated an increased DNA binding capacity with respect to increased percentage of the polymer. The study has concluded that poly(bisphenol Z oxalate) can be applied as one of the potential candidates for the high efficiency extraction of DNA by means of a simple, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly approach compared to the other traditional solid-phase methods.",Secondary Metabolites Profiling of Acinetobacter baumannii Associated with Chili (Capsicum annuum L.)

In the present study, secondary metabolites profiling of an endophytic bacterial strain, Acinetobacter baumannii, were explored using GC-MS study. Presence of antioxidant substances and antioxidant properties in chloroform (CHL), diethyl ether (DEE), and ethyl acetate (EA) crude extracts of the endophytic bacteria were studied. Total phenolic content (TPC), total flavonoid content (TFC), total antioxidant capacity (TAC), 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging activity, and ferrous ion chelating assay were evaluated. A total of 74 compounds were identified from the GC-MS analysis of the EA extract representing mostly alkane compounds followed by phenols, carboxylic acids, aromatic heterocyclic compounds, ketones, aromatic esters, aromatic benzenes, and alkenes. Among the two phenolic compounds, namely, phenol, 2,4-bis(1,1-dimethylethyl)- and phenol, 3,5-bis(1,1-dimethylethyl)-, the former was found in abundance (11.56%) while the latter was found in smaller quantity (0.14%). Moreover, the endophytic bacteria was found to possess a number of metal ions including Fe(II) and Cu(II) as 1307.13 ± 2.35 ppb and 42.38 ± 0.352 ppb, respectively. The extracts exhibited concentration dependent antioxidant and prooxidant properties at high and low concentrations, respectively. The presence of phenolic compounds and metal ions was believed to play an important role in the antioxidant and prooxidant potentials of the extracts. Further studies are suggested for exploring the untapped resource of endophytic bacteria for the development of novel therapeutic agents.","Malnutrition among 6-59-Month-Old Children at District 2 Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam: Prevalence and Associated Factors.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30868070,BioMed research international,2019 03 29,"Childhood malnutrition is major health concern in many low- and middle-income countries, including Vietnam.

Around 50% of human cancer tissues carry p53 mutations, and certain p53 mutations contribute to chemoresistance. In the present study, we found that histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) acts as a co-activator of tumor suppressor p53 and participates in the early molecular events following DNA damage. Anti-cancer drug adriamycin (ADR) treatment induced cell death in p53-wild-type human osteosarcoma U2OS cells, and this was accompanied by a remarkable accumulation of p53 and γH2AX. HDAC2 gene silencing significantly decreased the sensitivity of U2OS cells to ADR and attenuated p53-dependent DNA damage responses, such as ADR-mediated phosphorylation of ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and p53, as well as accumulation of γH2AX and cleaved poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase. However, HDAC2 knockdown had a marginal effect on p53-null human lung cancer H1299 cells following ADR exposure. In contrast, forced expression of HA-HDAC2 promoted cell death and stimulated the transcriptional activity of p53. Moreover, p53 and HDAC2 were found to co-precipitate with ATM. Together, our present results strongly suggest that the p53-HDAC2 axis plays a vital role in the regulation of the DNA damage response and also contributes to chemosensitivity of cancer cells.",Genome-wide profiling of mRNA and lncRNA expression in dengue fever and dengue hemorrhagic fever.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30868055,FEBS open bio,2019 03 29,"Dengue fever (DF) and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) are recurrent diseases that are widespread in the tropics. Here, we identified candidate genes associated with these diseases by performing integrated analyses of DF (GSE51808) and DHF (GSE18090) microarray datasets in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). In all, we identified 7635 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in DF and 8147 DEGs in DHF as compared to healthy controls (P < 0.05). In addition, we discovered 215 differentially expressed long non-coding RNAs (DElncRNAs) in DF and 225 DElncRNAs in DHF. There were 1256 common DEGs and eight common DElncRNAs in DHF vs DF, DHF vs normal control, and DF vs normal control groups. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis revealed that signal transduction (false discovery rate = 8.33E-10), 'toxoplasmosis', and 'protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum' were significantly enriched pathways for common DEGs. We conclude that the MAGED1,STAT1, and IL12A genes may play crucial roles in DF and DHF, and suggest that our findings may facilitate the identification of biomarkers and the development of new drug design strategies for DF and DHF treatment.",Mutations in gliclazide-associated genes may predict poor bladder cancer prognosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30868054,FEBS open bio,2019 03 29,"In recent years, an increasing number of patients have had diabetes and cancer simultaneously; thus, it is crucial for physicians to select hypoglycemic drugs with the lowest risk of inducing cancer. Gliclazide is a widely used sulfonylurea hypoglycemic drug, but its cancer risk remains controversial. Here, we explored the primary targets of gliclazide and its associated genes by querying an available database to construct a biological network. By using DrugBank and STRING, we found two primary targets of gliclazide and 50 gliclazide-associated genes, which were then enrolled for Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis using WebGestalt. From this analysis, we obtained the top 15 KEGG pathways. Accurate analysis of these KEGG pathways revealed that two pathways, one linked to bladder cancer and the other linked to the phosphoinositide 3-kinase-AKT signaling pathway, are functionally associated with gliclazide, and from these we identified four overlapping genes. Finally, genomic analysis using cBioPortal showed that genomic alterations of these four overlapping genes predict poor prognosis for patients with bladder cancer. In conclusion, gliclazide should be used with caution as a hypoglycemic drug for diabetic patients with cancer, especially bladder cancer. In addition, this study provides a functional network analysis to flexibly explore drug interaction systems and estimate their safety.",Macrophages engulf apoptotic and primary necrotic thymocytes through similar phosphatidylserine-dependent mechanisms.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30868053,FEBS open bio,2019 03 29,"One of the major roles of professional phagocytes is the removal of dead cells in the body. We know less about the clearance of necrotic cells than apoptotic cell phagocytosis, despite the fact that both types of dead cells need to be cleared together and necrotic cells appear often in pathological settings. In the present study, we examined phagocytosis of heat- or H2O2-killed necrotic and apoptotic thymocytes by mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) in vitro and found that the two cell types are engulfed at equal efficiency and compete with each other when added together to BMDMs. Phagocytosis of both apoptotic and necrotic thymocytes was decreased by (a) blocking phosphatidylserine on the surface of dying cells; (b) inhibition of Mer tyrosine kinase, Tim-4, integrin β3 receptor signaling, or Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 activity; or (c) using BMDMs deficient for transglutaminase 2. Stimulation of liver X, retinoid X, retinoic acid or glucocorticoid nuclear receptors in BMDMs enhanced not only apoptotic, but also necrotic cell uptake. Electron microscopic analysis of the engulfment process revealed that the morphology of phagosomes and the phagocytic cup formed during the uptake of dying thymocytes is similar for apoptotic and necrotic cells. Our data indicate that apoptotic and necrotic cells are cleared via the same mechanisms, and removal of necrotic cells in vivo can be facilitated by molecules known to enhance the uptake of apoptotic cells.",YAP1 overexpression is associated with poor prognosis of breast cancer patients and induces breast cancer cell growth by inhibiting PTEN.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30868052,FEBS open bio,2019 03 29,"YES-associated protein 1 (YAP1) plays a key role as a transcriptional coactivator in the Hippo tumor suppressor pathway. YAP1 is overexpressed in a variety of cancers and is considered to be encoded by a proto-oncogene. However, the role of YAP1 remains debatable, because both gain and loss of YAP1 expression have both been reported in breast cancer (BC). Here, we found that elevated expression of YAP1 mRNA in BC was negatively correlated with relapse-free, distant metastases-free and overall survival rates. We then knocked down or overexpressed YAP1 in human BC cells, and examined cell proliferation, apoptosis, and tumorigenic ability in vivo. We identified that YAP1 promotes cell growth and inhibits cell apoptosis of BC through the phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10-AKT signaling pathway, and thus suggest that YAP1 might serve as a new target for inhibiting BC progression.",Intact anti-LPS IgY is found in the blood after intragastric administration in mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30868051,FEBS open bio,2019 03 29,"Severe burn injury and cirrhosis often cause the translocation of bacterial endotoxins into blood, leading to systemic damage and even death. Our previous studies have shown that anti-lipopolysaccharide egg yolk antibody (anti-LPS IgY) can neutralize bacterial endotoxins in vitro and in vivo effectively, thereby reducing endotoxin damage. Whether anti-LPS IgY can be absorbed into the blood through the intestinal barrier and neutralize endotoxins in circulation remains unclear. In this study, we used in vivo small animal imaging techniques, protein purification, molecular biology, and mass spectrometry to show that intragastrically administered anti-LPS IgY is detected in the blood of mice as an intact molecule and has the capacity to bind to LPS. Immunohistochemical analysis confirmed that anti-LPS IgY is associated with the intestinal mucosa of mice. However, the route of absorption of this large protein molecule was not determined. This study suggests that anti-LPS IgY can be absorbed into the circulation, with the same molecular mass as purified anti-LPS IgY as a macromolecular protein, suggesting a new strategy for the prevention of damage caused by endotoxins.",Mass spectrometry-based analysis of macromolecular complexes of Staphylococcus aureus uracil-DNA glycosylase and its inhibitor reveals specific variations due to naturally occurring mutations.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30868050,FEBS open bio,2019 03 29,"The base excision repair pathway plays an important role in correcting damage induced by either physiological or external effects. This repair pathway removes incorrect bases from the DNA. The uracil base is among the most frequently occurring erroneous bases in DNA, and is cut out from the phosphodiester backbone via the catalytic action of uracil-DNA glycosylase. Uracil excision repair is an evolutionarily highly conserved pathway and can be specifically inhibited by a protein inhibitor of uracil-DNA glycosylase. Interestingly, both uracil-DNA glycosylase (Staphylococcus aureus uracil-DNA glycosylase; SAUDG) and its inhibitor (S. aureus uracil-DNA glycosylase inhibitor; SAUGI) are present in the staphylococcal cell. The interaction of these two proteins effectively decreases the efficiency of uracil-DNA excision repair. The physiological relevance of this complexation has not yet been addressed in detailed; however, numerous mutations have been identified within SAUGI. Here, we investigated whether these mutations drastically perturb the interaction with SAUDG. To perform quantitative analysis of the macromolecular interactions, we applied native mass spectrometry and demonstrated that this is a highly efficient and specific method for determination of dissociation constants. Our results indicate that several naturally occurring mutations of SAUGI do indeed lead to appreciable changes in the dissociation constants for complex formation. However, all of these Kd values remain in the nanomolar range and therefore the association of these two proteins is preserved. We conclude that complexation is most likely preserved even with the naturally occurring mutant uracil-DNA glycosylase inhibitor proteins.",Simultaneous Occurrence of Nanospheres and Nanofibers Self-Assembled from Achiral Tripeptides.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30868048,ChemistryOpen,2019 04 18,"The achiral tripeptide Boc-Aib-MABA-Aib-OMe has the ability to co-exist as nanospheres and as a network of nanofibers in methanol. Furthermore, AFM and TEM images show the presence of bulges in the network of nanofibers. Interestingly, the formation of nanofibers is seen to emerge from the outer boundary of the spherical structures. Some of the nanofibers curl up at the tip and later result in the formation of hollow nanospheres with thick boundaries. The presence of β-turn-like structures with hydrogen bonding is observed using FT-IR studies. The presence of hydrogen bonding is also demonstrated by using NMR studies.",Oxidation Chemistry of DNA and p53 Tumor Suppressor Gene.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30868047,ChemistryOpen,2019 03 29,"The chemistry of DNA and its repair selectivity control the influence of genomic oxidative stress on the development of serious disorders such as cancer and heart diseases. DNA is oxidized by endogenous reactive oxygen species (ROS) in vivo or in vitro as a result of high energy radiation, non-radiative metabolic processes, and other consequences of oxidative stress. Some oxidations of DNA and tumor suppressor gene p53 are thought to be mutagenic when not repaired. For example, site-specific oxidations of p53 tumor suppressor gene may lead to cancer-related mutations at the oxidation site codon. This review summarizes the research on the primary products of the most easily oxidized nucleobase guanine (G) when different oxidation methods are used. Guanine is by far the most oxidized DNA base. The primary initial oxidation product of guanine for most, but not all, pathways is 8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG). With an oxidation potential much lower than G, 8-oxoG is readily susceptible to further oxidation, and the products often depend on the oxidants. Specific products may control the types of subsequent mutations, but mediated by gene repair success. Site-specific oxidations of p53 tumor suppressor gene have been reported at known mutation hot spots, and the codon sites also depend on the type of oxidants. Modern methodologies using LC-MS/MS for codon specific detection and identification of oxidation sites are summarized. Future work aimed at understanding DNA oxidation in nucleosomes and interactions between DNA damage and repair is needed to provide a better picture of how cancer-related mutations arise.","Metal-Bonded Redox-Active Triarylamines and Their Interactions: Synthesis, Structure, and Redox Properties of Paddle-Wheel Copper Complexes.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30868045,ChemistryOpen,2019 03 14,"Invited for this month's cover picture is the group of Professor Winfried Plass at the Institute of Inorganic and Analytical Chemistry, Friedrich Schiller University, Jena (Germany).

It causes recurrent morbidity, and premature death is a distinct possibility, especially in Nigeria, which bears half the world's burden of SCD patients. Nigeria has yet to establish a newborn screening program; consequently, most affected children are diagnosed between one and three years of age when a health problem arises. Parents are unprepared to identify SCD and seek comprehensive management early enough for the best outcome. Awareness of carrier status and knowledge of SCD would ensure informed reproductive choices. Questionnaires were employed to conduct a prospective, cross-sectional study of the occurrence of missed carrier status of one biological parent of children enrolled at the pediatric sickle cell disease clinic of a teaching hospital. The institution's ethics committee approved the study. Of 133 respondents, 53% of the parents were unaware of being sickle cell carriers and did not expect to have children with SCD. Among families in which one or both parents proactively sought to know their genotype, 35% of all parents received incorrect genotyping results regarding the SCD risk of their offspring. The majority of incorrectly assigned hemoglobin AA results occurred in private laboratories. More than 60% of the respondents reported gaining awareness regarding SCD through antenatal care (51%) and schools (17%), as opposed to public awareness campaigns (8%). Many parents in our study population were unprepared for their children's SCD diagnosis. Awareness campaigns need to be revisited as a major potential modality to increase outreach about SCD.

It is imperative that this is investigated to assess if learning outcomes in trainees are actually improved. Methods The primary objective of this randomized prospective unblinded pilot study was to assess the effect of ARS on long-term learning outcomes, with a secondary objective of understanding perceptions of ARS amongst radiology residents. Twenty-two radiology residents were randomized into two groups of 11 residents each receiving five identical musculoskeletal (MSK) radiology lectures. One group received lectures through ARS and the other through traditional didactics. A pretest and identical posttest were completed by all residents at baseline and eight months later, respectively. Residents also completed a pre and post five-question Likert scale survey designed to measure perceptions of ARS. Results Wilcoxon rank sum tests revealed no statistically significant difference between the two groups of residents on the pretest (p = 0.47) or the posttest (p = 0.41). Of the five questions designed to gauge perceptions of ARS, ""How often do you study radiology outside of work?"" resulted in statistical significance between groups after the lecture series via ordinal logistic regression, with the ARS group six times more likely to study compared to the non-ARS group (Odds ratio = 6.52, P = 0.04, 95% Confidence Interval [1.1, 38.2]). There was no statistical difference in response to this question prior to the lecture series.

Nearly 85% of pancreatic cancer is adenocarcinoma. Given the silent disease progression of pancreatic cancer, identifying at-risk populations will help diagnose these fatal cancers as early as possible. Methods The United States Cancer Statistics (USCS) registry was used to obtain data for pancreatic adenocarcinoma from 2001 to 2015. The incidence analysis was stratified based on sex, race, stage, and US regional location. Results The overall incidence of pancreatic adenocarcinoma from 2001 to 2015 was 5.2 per 100,000 people per year. The overall incidence rates were the greatest for each stratification in males, blacks, distant disease, and in the Northeast. The incidence in blacks continued to rise with an annual percent change (APC) of 2.28 between 2001 and 2015. Between 2001 and 2006, the incidence of distant disease increased at a rapid rate (APC 5.34). However, after 2006, the incidence continued to increase but no longer at the previously rapid rate (APC 1.91). For incidence based on US regional location, the overall incidence was greatest in the Northeast and Midwest. The incidence in the South was increasing at an expeditious rate (APC 2.70). Conclusion In our study, we analyzed the incidence of pancreatic adenocarcinoma using data from all 50 states in the US. Our findings showed that there was a worsening incidence in blacks, those with a distant stage at diagnosis, and those in the North and Midwest. Ultimately our findings help identify at-risk populations and can contribute to improving surveillance of this deadly disease.","Hemodialysis Session Duration, Ultrafiltration Rate, Interdialytic Weight Gain and their Association with Albumin in Patients on Intermittent Hemodialysis in a Regional Dialysis Unit: A Cross-sectional Study.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30868008,Cureus,2019 03 29,"Aim Several studies suggest that a low pre-dialysis serum albumin level (<40g/L) is associated with increased mortality in dialysis patients. The objective of this study was to assess if hemodialysis session duration (HSD), ultrafiltration rate (UFR) and interdialytic weight gain percentage (IDWG%) are associated with pre-dialysis serum albumin levels (markers of all-cause mortality), thus influencing mortality.  Method  This is a cross-sectional analytical study in which data were collected from a regional cohort of 59 prevalent chronic hemodialysis patients using a national electronic database (eMED). Continuous data were analyzed using a regression model to assess for an association between HSD, IDWG% and UFR with albumin levels. Results Fifty-six patients were included in the study. Multiple linear regression models demonstrated a cross-sectional association between longer HSD and higher serum albumin levels and a statistically significant positive correlation (r = 0.353; p < 0.05). No significant association of UFR (p = 0.169) and IDWG% (p = 0.549) with albumin was observed. Mean albumin was 38.07 ± 3.96 g/L in the HSD <240 min group compared to 40.50 ± 2.83g/L in the HSD ≥240 min group which was statistically significant (p < 0.05). Conclusion Longer HSD has a cross-sectional association with higher pre-dialysis serum albumin with patients having HSD ≥240 min demonstrating the highest levels of serum albumin. Our study suggests longer HSD may improve mortality in the dialysis population.",Well-being Assessment of Medical Professionals in Progressive Levels of Training: Derived from the WHO-5 Well-being Index.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30868004,Cureus,2019 03 29,"The provision of quality health care is of utmost importance for a physician. Over the years, there has been much debate regarding work-life imbalance and physician burnout, which may, in turn, have adverse effects on the quality of care. Medical school students, residents, interview candidates for residency, and internal medicine faculty are all under a varying degree of stress, which may impact their personal and professional lives. We distributed questionnaires to investigate our hypothesis: Progression in training years leads to a decline in well-being. The main objective of our assessment was to help devise interventions to improve the quality of training and the productivity of internal medicine physicians. Understanding the emotional functioning of physicians will help us improve the learning environment and, in turn, have a positive impact in the future for medical professionals. Medical students are burdened with excessive loans for undergraduate and graduate studies, which contributes to higher rates of burnout, depression, and suicide among medical professionals, which can lead to a direct and negative impact on quality of care. Our study showed that well-being scores declined with increasing financial stress; they were also affected by the visa status and training background of our subjects as medical students.","Acute Hepatitis in Infections Caused by Dengue Virus in Southern Punjab, Pakistan.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30868002,Cureus,2019 03 29,"Background Dengue is the most common vector-borne disease worldwide. It poses a significant health burden in tropical and subtropical countries. Common clinical presentations include retro-orbital pain, fever, headache, nausea, vomiting and aches and pains in the body. A severe form of dengue fever is known as dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) that includes signs of hemorrhage. Besides the typical signs and symptoms, atypical presentations of dengue include myositis, hepatitis and encephalitis. Hepatic involvement in dengue has varied presentations. This study aims to highlight the importance of acute hepatitis, an atypical presentation in dengue patients. Methods  We conducted a descriptive, cross-sectional study in the Medical Unit-1 of Bahawal Victoria Hospital, Bahawalpur, a tertiary-care hospital serving the area of Southern Punjab, Pakistan. The relevant medical records of 63 patients admitted with dengue-associated hepatitis to the Medical Unit-1 of Bahawal Victoria Hospital, Bahawalpur, between January 1, 2015 and December 1, 2016, were reviewed. Informed consent was given. Information regarding demographic variables and disease course was collected and analyzed. Results  This study included 55 men (87.3%) and eight (12.7%) women. Fifty (79.3%) patients were diagnosed with dengue fever (DF). Thirteen patients were managed on the lines of DHF. Out of the total 63 patients, only six were locals. The common clinical presentations in these patients included high fever, retro-orbital pain, severe headache, rash, dark-colored urine, bleeding problems and hepatomegaly. Higher levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were noted in comparison to alanine transferase (ALT). Despite the complicated clinical course in some patients, all patients were managed successfully and discharged, except one. Conclusion The frequency of acute hepatitis in dengue patients is high, especially in young men. Early diagnosis and prompt treatment are necessary for better prognosis. Although no specific treatment guidelines are available, supportive treatment in a timely fashion can prevent complications. Transfusion with packed cell volume (PCV) and N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) has produced promising results."

It's necessary to distinguish low-grade tumors from high-grade tumors by understanding the molecular basis of different grades of glioma, which is an important step in defining new biomarkers and therapeutic strategies. We have chosen the gene expression profile GSE52009 from gene expression omnibus (GEO) database to detect important differential genes. GSE52009 contains 120 samples, including 60 WHO II samples and 24 WHO IV samples that were selected in our analysis. We used the GEO2R tool to pick out differently expressed genes (DEGs) between low-grade glioma and high-grade glioma, and then we used the database for annotation, visualization and integrated discovery to perform gene ontology analysis and Kyoto encyclopedia of gene and genome pathway analysis. Furthermore, we used the Cytoscape search tool for the retrieval of interacting genes with molecular complex detection plug-in applied to achieve the visualization of protein-protein interaction (PPI). We selected 15 hub genes with higher degrees of connectivity, including tissue inhibitors metalloproteinases-1 and serum amyloid A1; additionally, we used GSE53733 containing 70 glioblastoma samples to conduct Gene Set Enrichment Analysis. In conclusion, our bioinformatics analysis showed that DEGs and hub genes may be defined as new biomarkers for diagnosis and for guiding the therapeutic strategies of glioblastoma.",Transcriptome sequencing and comparative analysis of adult ovary and testis identify potential gonadal maintenance-related genes in Mauremys reevesii with temperature-dependent sex determination.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867990,PeerJ,2019 03 29,"Mauremys reevesii is a classical organism with temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD). Gonad development in early life has recently received considerable attention but gonadal maintenance after sex differentiation in turtles with TSD remains a mystery. In this study, we sequenced the transcriptomes for the adult testis and ovary using RNA-seq, and 36,221 transcripts were identified. In total, 1,594 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified where 756 DEGs were upregulated in the testis and 838 DEGs were upregulated in the ovary. Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis suggested that the TGF-beta signaling pathway and Hedgehog signaling pathway have important roles in testis maintenance and spermatogenesis, whereas the Hippo signaling pathway and Wnt signaling pathway are likely to participate in ovary maintenance. We determined the existence of antagonistic networks containing significant specific-expressed genes and pathways related to gonadal maintenance and gametogenesis in the adult gonads of M. reevesii. The candidate gene Fibronectin type 3 and ankyrin repeat domains 1 (FANK1) might be involved with the regulation of testis spermatogenesis.",Experimental mechanical strain measurement of tissues.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867989,PeerJ,2019 03 29,"Strain, an important biomechanical factor, occurs at different scales from molecules and cells to tissues and organs in physiological conditions. Under mechanical strain, the strength of tissues and their micro- and nanocomponents, the structure, proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis of cells and even the cytokines expressed by cells probably shift. Thus, the measurement of mechanical strain (i.e., relative displacement or deformation) is critical to understand functional changes in tissues, and to elucidate basic relationships between mechanical loading and tissue response. In the last decades, a great number of methods have been developed and applied to measure the deformations and mechanical strains in tissues comprising bone, tendon, ligament, muscle and brain as well as blood vessels. In this article, we have reviewed the mechanical strain measurement from six aspects: electro-based, light-based, ultrasound-based, magnetic resonance-based and computed tomography-based techniques, and the texture correlation-based image processing method. The review may help solving the problems of experimental and mechanical strain measurement of tissues under different measurement environments.",Exotic urban trees conserve similar natural enemy communities to native congeners but have fewer pests.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867988,PeerJ,2019 03 29,"Urban trees serve a critical conservation function by supporting arthropod and vertebrate communities but are often subject to arthropod pest infestations. Native trees are thought to support richer arthropod communities than exotic trees but may also be more susceptible to herbivorous pests. Exotic trees may be less susceptible to herbivores but provide less conservation value as a consequence. We tested the hypotheses that native species in Acer and Quercus would have more herbivorous pests than exotic congeners and different communities of arthropod natural enemies. The density of scale insects, common urban tree pests, was greatest on a native Acer and a native Quercus than exotic congeners in both years of our research (2012 and 2016) and sometimes reached damaging levels. However, differences in predator and parasitoid abundance, diversity, and communities were not consistent between native and exotic species in either genus and were generally similar. For example, in 2012 neither predator nor parasitoid abundance differed among native and exotic Acer congeners but in 2016 a native species, A. saccharum, had the least of both groups. A native, Q. phellos, had significantly more predators and parasitoids in 2012 than its native and exotic congeners but no differences in 2016. Parasitoid communities were significantly different among Acer species and Quercus species due in each case to greater abundance of a single family on one native tree species. These native and exotic tree species could help conserve arthropod natural enemies and achieve pest management goals.",Comparison of laboratory indices of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease for the detection of incipient kidney dysfunction.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867987,PeerJ,2019 03 29,"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is closely linked to insulin resistance and related adverse health outcomes. We investigated the non-invasive index of NAFLD that has the best performance in estimating the renal manifestations of metabolic disturbances. This nation-wide, cross-sectional study included 11,836 subjects, using various non-invasive assessments comprising routinely measured clinical and laboratory variables. The subjects were native Koreans aged 20 years or older and had no diabetes, history of liver or kidney disease. All participants were divided into quintiles according to their fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) results. Participants in the highest quintile were more hypertensive and obese with greater glycemic exposure, poor lipid profiles, and impaired kidney function, than those in the other quintiles. Multiple logistic regression, adjusted for age, sex, smoking, systolic blood pressure, white blood cell, platelet, fasting plasma glucose, and triglyceride, demonstrated that FIB-4, the hepatic steatosis index, the aspartate aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase (AST/ALT) ratio, Gholam's model for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, and the BARD score were independently associated with kidney dysfunction. ROC curve analysis revealed that FIB-4 (AUC = 0.6227, 95% CI [0.5929-0.6526], p = 0.0258) was the most precise in predicting kidney dysfunction. Our findings suggest that FIB-4 may be a favorable screening tool for the renal manifestation of hepatic metabolic disturbances.",cRegulome: an R package for accessing microRNA and transcription factor-gene expression correlations in cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867986,PeerJ,2019 03 29,Transcription factors and microRNAs play a critical role in regulating the gene expression in normal physiology and pathological conditions.

A challenge in community forest (CF) management is to realize their carbon value without compromising their role in the provision of these traditional goods and services. In this study of CF dominated by Pinus roxburghii in the Phalebas region of Nepal, the impacts of stand composition and geographic aspect on aboveground forest carbon is investigated as a means to optimize CF management for both traditional values and for emerging carbon market values. The aboveground carbon of mixed and monospecific stands of Pinus roxburghii was estimated using a combination of destructive sampling and species-specific allometric equations. On average, monospecific stands contained 106.2 Mg C ha-1 in aboveground tree biomass, significantly more than mixed stands at 73.1 Mg C ha-1 (p = 0.022). Similarly, stands growing on northern aspects (northeast 124.8 Mg C ha-1, northwest 100.9 Mg C ha-1) stored significantly more carbon (p = 0.002) than southern aspects (southeast 75.3 Mg C ha-1, southwest 57.6 Mg C ha-1), reflecting the more favorable growing conditions of northern aspects. These results suggest monospecific stands planted on northern aspects may be best suited for management to achieve carbon benefits, whilst mixed-species stands on southern aspects may be better suited for biodiversity conservation and supporting livelihoods. To maintain and increase carbon value, community forestry may need to implement nutrient return practices to limit the impact of sustained nutrient removals on stand productivity.",Modulating pain thresholds through classical conditioning.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867984,PeerJ,2019 03 29,"Classical conditioning has frequently been shown to be capable of evoking fear of pain and avoidance behavior in the context of chronic pain.

Therefore, the present study investigated whether pain threshold ratings can be modified by the presence of conditioned non-nociceptive sensory stimuli in healthy participant.",A multi-year experiment shows that lower precipitation predictability encourages plants' early life stages and enhances population viability.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867983,PeerJ,2019 03 29,"Climate change is a key factor that may cause the extinction of species. The associated reduced weather predictability may alter the survival of plants, especially during their early life stages, when individuals are most fragile. While it is expected that extreme weather events will be highly detrimental for species, the effects of more subtle environmental changes have been little considered. In a four-year experiment on two herbaceous plants, Papaver rhoeas and Onobrychis viciifolia, we manipulated the predictability of precipitation by changing the temporal correlation of precipitation events while maintaining average precipitation constant, leading to more and less predictable treatments. We assessed the effect of predictability on plant viability in terms of seedling emergence, survival, seed production, and population growth rate. We found greater seedling emergence, survival, and population growth for plants experiencing lower intra-seasonal predictability, but more so during early compared to late life stages. Since predictability levels were maintained across four generations, we have also tested whether descendants exhibited transgenerational responses to previous predictability conditions. In P. rhoeas, descendants had increased the seedling emergence compared to ancestors under both treatments, but more so under lower precipitation predictability. However, higher predictability in the late treatment induced higher survival in descendants, showing that these conditions may benefit long-term survival. This experiment highlights the ability of some plants to rapidly exploit environmental resources and increase their survival under less predictable conditions, especially during early life stages. Therefore, this study provides relevant evidence of the survival capacity of some species under current and future short-term environmental alterations.",In vitro observation: the GFP-E. coli adhering to porcine erythrocytes can be removed by porcine alveolar macrophages.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867982,PeerJ,2019 03 29,"Although the activation of pathogen phagocytosis via complement system has been studied, erythrocyte-phagocyte interactions in pigs are not clearly understood. Therefore, we sought to investigate the ability of porcine erythrocytes to clear immune complexes (ICs) by using laser confocal microscopy and flow cytometry to observe the immune adhesion of porcine erythrocytes to fluorescent bacilli and the immune presentation process of transferring fluorescent bacilli to macrophages. Isolated porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs) had uniform morphology and size, and a survival rate of 97.2%. The phagocytosis rate was 98.8%. After WT E. coli was labeled with Fluorescein Isothiocyanate (FITC), the bacteria showed a bright green fluorescence, and the labeling rate was 92.3%. When laser confocal microscopy was utilized to observe the co-incubation system of porcine erythrocytes, PAM, and fluorescent E. coli, the fluorescence intensity of bacilli decreased with increasing observation time and even disappeared. Flow Cytometry examination showed that the average fluorescence intensity of PAMs co-incubated with porcine erythrocytes adhered to WT-E. coli-FITC, was significantly higher than that of normal PAMs. Furthermore, when porcine erythrocytes adhered to WT E. coli were incubated with PAMs, the surface mean fluorescence intensity of porcine erythrocytes was significantly higher than that of the blank control group. This shows that PAMs can competitively bind to the oposinized E. coli adhered to the surface of porcine erythrocytes, and these oposinized pathogens can enter macrophages by the process of phagocytosis, which promoting the internalization of ICs or pathogens. During this process, the physical morphology of porcine erythrocytes was not damaged, but the levels of its main functional protein CR1-like were reduced."

Fetuin-B is a highly selective and potent inhibitor of metallo-peptidases (MPs) of the astacin family, which includes ovastacin in mammals. By inhibiting ovastacin, fetuin-B is essential for female fertility. The crystal structure of fetuin-B was determined unbound and in complex with archetypal astacin, and it was found that the inhibitor has tandem cystatin-type modules (CY1 and CY2). They are connected by an exposed linker with a rigid, disulfide-linked 'CPDCP-trunk', and are followed by a C-terminal region (CTR) with little regular secondary structure. The CPDCP-trunk and a hairpin of CY2 form a bipartite wedge, which slots into the active-site cleft of the MP. These elements occupy the nonprimed and primed sides of the cleft, respectively, but spare the specificity pocket so that the inhibitor is not cleaved. The aspartate in the trunk blocks the catalytic zinc of astacin, while the CY2 hairpin binds through a QWVXGP motif. The CY1 module assists in structural integrity and the CTR is not involved in inhibition, as verified by in vitro studies using a cohort of mutants and variants. Overall, the inhibition conforms to a novel 'raised-elephant-trunk' mechanism for MPs, which is reminiscent of single-domain cystatins that target cysteine peptidases. Over 200 sequences from vertebrates have been annotated as fetuin-B, underpinning its ubiquity and physiological relevance; accordingly, sequences with conserved CPDCP- and QWVXGP-derived motifs have been found from mammals to cartilaginous fishes. Thus, the raised-elephant-trunk mechanism is likely to be generally valid for the inhibition of astacins by orthologs of fetuin-B.",Fixed-target serial oscillation crystallography at room temperature.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867928,IUCrJ,2019 03 29,"A fixed-target approach to high-throughput room-temperature serial synchrotron crystallography with oscillation is described. Patterned silicon chips with microwells provide high crystal-loading density with an extremely high hit rate. The microfocus, undulator-fed beamline at CHESS, which has compound refractive optics and a fast-framing detector, was built and optimized for this experiment. The high-throughput oscillation method described here collects 1-5° of data per crystal at room temperature with fast (10° s-1) oscillation rates and translation times, giving a crystal-data collection rate of 2.5 Hz. Partial datasets collected by the oscillation method at a storage-ring source provide more complete data per crystal than still images, dramatically lowering the total number of crystals needed for a complete dataset suitable for structure solution and refinement - up to two orders of magnitude fewer being required. Thus, this method is particularly well suited to instances where crystal quantities are low. It is demonstrated, through comparison of first and last oscillation images of two systems, that dose and the effects of radiation damage can be minimized through fast rotation and low angular sweeps for each crystal.",Time-resolved grazing-incidence pair distribution functions during deposition by radio-frequency magnetron sputtering.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867927,IUCrJ,2019 03 29,"Characterization of local order in thin films is challenging with pair distribution function (PDF) analysis because of the minute mass of the scattering material. Here, it is demonstrated that reliable high-energy grazing-incidence total X-ray scattering data can be obtained in situ during thin-film deposition by radio-frequency magnetron sputtering. A benchmark system of Pt was investigated in a novel sputtering chamber mounted on beamline P07-EH2 at the PETRA III synchrotron. Robust and high-quality PDFs can be obtained from films as thin as 3 nm and atomistic modelling of the PDFs with a time resolution of 0.5 s is possible. In this way, it was found that a polycrystalline Pt thin film deposits with random orientation at 8 W and 2 × 10-2 mbar at room temperature. From the PDF it was found that the coherent-scattering domains grow with time.

Today, the PDF approach is an integral part of research on amorphous, nanocrystalline and disordered materials from bulk to nanoparticle size. Thin films, however, demand specific experimental strategies for enhanced surface sensitivity and sophisticated data treatment to obtain high-quality PDF data. The approach described here is based on the surface high-energy X-ray diffraction technique applying photon energies above 60 keV at grazing incidence. In this way, reliable PDFs were extracted from films of thicknesses down to a few nanometres. Compared with recently published reports on thin-film PDF analysis from both transmission and grazing-incidence geometries, this work brought the minimum detectable film thickness down by about a factor of ten. Depending on the scattering power of the sample, the data acquisition on such ultrathin films can be completed within fractions of a second. Hence, the rapid-acquisition grazing-incidence PDF method is a major advancement in thin-film technology that opens unprecedented possibilities for in situ and operando PDF studies in complex sample environments. By uncovering how the structure of a layered material on a substrate evolves and transforms in terms of local and average ordering, this technique offers new opportunities for understanding processes such as nucleation, growth, morphology evolution, crystallization and the related kinetics on the atomic level and in real time.",Rigid-body motion is the main source of diffuse scattering in protein crystallography.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867925,IUCrJ,2019 03 29,"The origin of diffuse X-ray scattering from protein crystals has been the subject of debate over the past three decades regarding whether it arises from correlated atomic motions within the molecule or from rigid-body disorder. Here, a supercell approach to modelling diffuse scattering is presented that uses ensembles of molecular models representing rigid-body motions as well as internal motions as obtained from ensemble refinement. This approach allows oversampling of Miller indices and comparison with equally oversampled diffuse data, thus allowing the maximum information to be extracted from experiments. It is found that most of the diffuse scattering comes from correlated motions within the unit cell, with only a minor contribution from longer-range correlated displacements. Rigid-body motions, and in particular rigid-body translations, make by far the most dominant contribution to the diffuse scattering, and internal motions give only a modest addition. This suggests that modelling biologically relevant protein dynamics from diffuse scattering may present an even larger challenge than was thought."

The combination of results from X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs), modern synchrotron crystallographic beamlines and cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) is proving to be particularly powerful. The highly brilliant undulator beamlines at modern synchrotron facilities have empowered the crystallographic revolution of high-throughput structure determination at high resolution. The brilliance of the X-rays at these crystallographic beamlines has enabled this to be achieved using microcrystals, but at the expense of an increased absorbed X-ray dose and a consequent vulnerability to radiation-induced changes. The advent of serial femtosecond crystallography (SFX) with X-ray free-electron lasers provides a new opportunity in which damage-free structures can be obtained from much smaller crystals (2 µm) and more complex macromolecules, including membrane proteins and multi-protein complexes. For redox enzymes, SFX provides a unique opportunity by providing damage-free structures at both cryogenic and ambient temperatures. The promise of being able to visualize macromolecular structures and complexes at high resolution without the need for crystals using X-rays has remained a dream, but recent technological advancements in cryoEM have made this come true and hardly a month goes by when the structure of a new/novel macromolecular assembly is not revealed. The uniqueness of cryoEM in providing structural information for multi-protein complexes, particularly membrane proteins, has been demonstrated by examples such as respirasomes. The synergistic use of cryoEM and crystallography in lead-compound optimization is highlighted by the example of the visualization of antimalarial compounds in cytochrome bc1.

The landmark (non-aromatic) examples include quinoid rings, planar radicals and metal-chelate rings. The results can be summarized as: (i) non-aromatic planar polyenic rings can be stacked, (ii) interactions are more pronounced between systems or rings with little or no π-electron delocalization (e.g. quinones) than those involving delocalized systems (e.g. aromatics), and (iii) the main component of the interaction is electrostatic/multipolar between closed-shell rings, whereas (iv) interactions between radicals involve a significant covalent contribution (multicentric bonding). Thus, stacking covers a wide range of interactions and energies, ranging from weak dispersion to unlocalized two-electron multicentric covalent bonding ('pancake bonding'), allowing a face-to-face stacking arrangement in some chemical species (quinone anions).

This successful outcome results from the efficient combination of high-throughput sequencing technologies together with robust and complementary approaches for functional validation, in vitro, and in vivo using the mouse and unicellular model organisms such as the flagellated parasite T. brucei. Importantly, these genes are distinct from genes responsible for Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (PCD), an autosomal recessive disease associated with both respiratory cilia and sperm flagellum defects, and their mutations therefore exclusively lead to male infertility. In the future, these genetic findings will definitely improve the diagnosis efficiency of male infertility and might provide genotype-phenotype correlations, which could be helpful for the prognosis of intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) performed with sperm from MMAF patients.

Such PPIs are potential drugs targets, leading to the need to inhibit/block specific PPIs. While small molecule inhibitors have had some success and reached clinical trials, they have generally failed to address the flat and large nature of PPI surfaces. As a result, larger biologics were developed for PPI surfaces and they have successfully targeted PPIs located outside the cell. However, biologics have low bioavailability and cannot reach intracellular targets. A novel class -hydrocarbon-stapled α-helical peptides that are synthetic mini-proteins locked into their bioactive structure through site-specific introduction of a chemical linker- has shown promise. Stapled peptides show an ability to inhibit intracellular PPIs that previously have been intractable with traditional small molecule or biologics, suggesting that they offer a novel therapeutic modality. In this review, we highlight what stapling adds to natural-mimicking peptides, describe the revolution of synthetic chemistry techniques and how current drug discovery approaches have been adapted to stabilize active peptide conformations, including ring-closing metathesis (RCM), lactamisation, cycloadditions and reversible reactions.

IKKα is an essential protein for cell survival and differentiation, which expression is enhanced in human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and correlates with poor patient survival, appearing as a relevant molecule in lung cancer progression. However, there are not conclusive results about its role in this type of cancer. We have recently found that IKKα performs different functions and activates different signaling pathways depending on its nuclear or cytoplasmic localization in tumor epidermal cells. In this work, we have studied the involvement of IKKα in lung cancer progression through the generation of lung cancer cell lines expressing exogenous IKKα either in the nucleus or in the cytoplasm. We demonstrate that IKKα signaling promotes increased cell malignancy of NSCLC cells as well as lung tumor progression and metastasis in either subcellular localization, through activation of common protumoral proteins, such as Erk, p38 and mTor. But, additionally, we found that depending on its subcellular localization, IKKα has non-overlapping roles in the activation of other different pathways known for their key implication in lung cancer progression: while cytoplasmic IKKα increases EGFR and NF-κB activities in lung tumor cells, nuclear IKKα causes lung tumor progression through c-Myc, Smad2/3 and Snail activation.

In our model, solute transport results from fluidic forcing driven by the superposition of forward and reverse propagating boundary waves. The aim of this study is to experimentally validate this hydrodynamic reverse transport mechanism in a microfluidic device where reverse transport in a rectangular conduit is driven by applying waveforms along its boundaries. Our results support our theory that while the superimposed boundary waves propagate in the forward direction, a reverse flow in the rectangular conduit can be induced by boundary wave reflections. We quantified the fluid transport velocity and direction under various boundary conditions and analyzed numerical simulations that support our experimental findings. We identified a set of boundary wave parameters that achieved reverse transport, which could be responsible for intramural periarterial drainage of cerebral metabolic waste.",Analytical study of AC electroosmotic mixing in 2-dimensional microchannel with time periodic surface potential.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867886,Biomicrofluidics,2019 03 29,"This work reported an analytic study of AC electroosmotic flows with a view to control the degree of mixing in a rectangular microchannel. Only with spatially non-uniform zeta potential distribution, fluid particles travel back and forth along a vortical flow field developed inside a microchannel. Although complex patterns of electroosmotic vortical flows can be obtained by various types of non-uniform zeta potential distributions, fluid particles always follow regular paths due to a laminar flow limit. To further facilitate the mixing of sample fluid, we propose a scheme that the zeta potential distribution was temporally non-uniform as well. General solutions for both the double layer potential distribution and the AC electroosmotic flow field are analytically determined by solving the unsteady Stokes equation with an electrostatic body force. As an illustrative example, we consider a case where two different types of non-uniform zeta potential distributions alternate with each other and the effects of both the AC frequency and the frequency of the alternation of the two zeta potential distributions on flow characteristics are examined using the Poincaré sections. Conclusively, one can either enhance or prevent mixing compared to a static electroosmotic flow, which is in line with previously demonstrated experimental works. Thus, the results presented would be an effective mean for controllable electroosmotic flow in a microfluidic platform.",Orthogonal co-cultivation of smooth muscle cell and endothelial cell layers to construct in vivo-like vasculature.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867885,Biomicrofluidics,2019 03 29,"Development of a three-dimensional (3D) vascular co-cultivation system is one of the major challenges to provide an advanced analytical platform for studying blood vessel related diseases. To date, however, the in vivo-like vessel system has not been fully realized due to the difficulty of co-cultivation of the cells with orthogonal alignment. In this study, we report the utilization of microfabrication technology to construct biomimetic 3D co-cultured vasculature. First, microwrinkle patterns whose direction was perpendicular to the axis of a circular microfluidic channel were fabricated, and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) were cultured inside the microchannel, leading to an in vivo-like circumferential VSMC layer. Then, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were co-cultured on the circumferentially aligned VSMC, and the success of double layer formation of HUVEC-VSMC in the circular microchannel could be monitored. After HUVEC cultivation, we applied shear flow in order to induce the orientation of HUVEC parallel to the axis, and the analysis of orientation angle and spreading area of HUVECs indicated that they were changed by shear stress to be aligned to the direction of flow. Thus, the HUVEC and VSMC layer could be aligned with a distinct direction. The expression level of VE-Cadherin located at the boundary of HUVECs implies in vivo-like vascular behavior. The proposed in vitro microfluidic vascular assay platform would be valuable for studying vascular diseases with high reliability due to in vivo-likeness.",An automated microfluidic system for selection of aptamer probes against ovarian cancer tissues.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867884,Biomicrofluidics,2019 03 29,"Because of the difficulty of treatment in its latest stages, cancer is among the leading causes of death worldwide.

The integrated microfluidic system consisted of an integrated microfluidic chip, a temperature control module equipped with 12 thermoelectric coolers, and a flow control module for controlling 36 electromagnetic valves such that the entire, tissue-based SELEX process could be fully automated and carried out within 15 h. Highly specific ovarian cancer aptamers with high affinity (dissociation constant of 129 nM) to their cellular targets were screened with this system. Given the comparable specificity to their much more expensive antibody counterparts, these aptamers, when used in conjunction with the developed microfluidic system, may be used to diagnose ovarian cancer in its earliest stages.",Joule heating-induced particle manipulation on a microfluidic chip.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867883,Biomicrofluidics,2019 03 29,"We develop an electrokinetic technique that continuously manipulates colloidal particles to concentrate into patterned particulate groups in an energy efficient way, by exclusive harnessing of the intrinsic Joule heating effects. Our technique exploits the alternating current electrothermal flow phenomenon which is generated due to the interaction between non-uniform electric and thermal fields. Highly non-uniform electric field generates sharp temperature gradients by generating spatially-varying Joule heat that varies along the radial direction from a concentrated point hotspot. Sharp temperature gradients induce a local variation in electric properties which, in turn, generate a strong electrothermal vortex. The imposed fluid flow brings the colloidal particles at the centre of the hotspot and enables particle aggregation. Furthermore, maneuvering structures of the Joule heating spots, different patterns of particle clustering may be formed in a low power budget, thus opening up a new realm of on-chip particle manipulation process without necessitating a highly focused laser beam which is much complicated and demands higher power budget. This technique can find its use in Lab-on-a-chip devices to manipulate particle groups, including biological cells.",Generation of functional hepatocyte 3D discoids in an acoustofluidic bioreactor.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867882,Biomicrofluidics,2019 05 03,"Ultrasonic standing wave systems have previously been used for the generation of 3D constructs for a range of cell types. In the present study, we cultured cells from the human hepatoma Huh7 cell line in a Bulk Acoustic Wave field and studied their viability, their functions, and their response to the anti-cancer drug, 5 Fluorouracil (5FU). We found that cells grown in the acoustofluidic bioreactor (AFB) expressed no reduction in viability up to 6 h of exposure compared to those cultured in a conventional 2D system. In addition, constructs created in the AFB and subsequently cultured outside of it had improved functionality including higher albumin and urea production than 2D or pellet cultures. The viability of Huh7 cells grown in the ultrasound field to 5FU anti-cancer drug was comparable to that of cells cultured in the 2D system, showing rapid diffusion into the aggregate core. We have shown that AFB formed 3D cell constructs have improved functionality over the conventional 2D monolayer and could be a promising model for anti-cancer drug testing.",Microfluidic rectifier for polymer solutions flowing through porous media.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867881,Biomicrofluidics,2019 03 29,"Fluidic rectification refers to anisotropic flow resistance upon changing the flow direction. Polymeric solutions, in contrast to Newtonian fluids, can exhibit an anisotropic flow resistance in microfluidic devices by tuning the channel shape at low Reynolds number. Such a concept has not been investigated in an anisotropic porous medium. We have developed a fluidic rectifier based on an anisotropic porous medium consisting of a periodic array of triangular pillars that can operate at a low Reynolds number. Rectification is achieved, when the type of high Weissenberg number elastic instabilities changes with the flow direction. The flow resistance differs across the two directions of the anisotropic porous medium geometry. We have identified the type of elastic instabilities that appear in both forward and backward directions. Particularly, we found a qualitative relation between the dead-zone instability and the onset of fluidic rectification."

The model uses a continuum Poisson-Nernst-Planck theory including source terms to account for the catalytic second Wien effect between ionogenic groups in the membranes and resolves the Debye layers at interfaces. The resulting electric field at the membrane junction is increased by as much as four orders of magnitude in comparison to the field external to the membrane. This leads to a significant amplification of the second Wien effect, creating an increased ionic flux due to the catalytic decomposition of water. The effect also induces an exaltation effect wherein the salt ion flux undergoes a concomitant increase as well. The interplay of effects results in a unique over-limiting current mechanism due to concentration polarization internal, rather than external, to the membranes. In addition to the case of two equal but oppositely charged membranes under the standard simplifying assumption of equal ionic diffusivities, two variations on this model are studied. Asymmetric diffusivities, representative of the actual mobility difference in dissociated water ions, and the effect of the membrane charge density ratio were also considered. The latter elucidates an overlimiting current shift mechanism for DNA adsorption on anion-selective membranes proposed by Slouka et al. [Langmuir 29, 8275 (2013)]. The former provides more realistic picture of multi-ion transport and demonstrates a surprising steady-state effect due to the asymmetry in the diffusivity of hydroxide and hydronium.",Two-way detection of image features and immunolabeling of lymphoma cells with one-step microarray analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867867,Biomicrofluidics,2019 03 29,"Detecting the number of pathological lymphoma cells and lymphocyte subtypes in blood is helpful for clinical diagnosis and typing of lymphoma. In the current study, cell type is identified by cell morphological features and immunolabeled lymphocyte subtypes. Red blood cells and leukocytes were separated using a microfluidic cell chip based on physical blood cell parameters, and leukocytes were identified using five characteristic parameters: energy variance, entropy variance, moment of inertia variance, color mean, and cell area individually. The number of red blood cells that could come into contact with the leukocyte membrane was ≤2 based on the microfluidic injection flow rate of microfluidic chips. Anti-CD3 and anti-CD19 antibodies were used for immunofluorescence staining of T-lymphocyte and B-lymphocyte surface antigens, respectively. The results suggested that the microfluidic assay could detect lymphocyte surface antigen markers and intact leukocytes. Therefore, we report a one-step microfluidic chip for classifying hematological lymphoma cells based on the physical parameters of cells, which can simultaneously measure the overall morphology of blood cells and immunolabeling of lymphocyte surface antigens in one step, solving the current problem of detecting subtypes of hematological lymphoma cells based on multiple methods and multi-step detection.",Rapid prototyping of fluoropolymer microchannels by xurography for improved solvent resistance.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867866,Biomicrofluidics,2019 03 29,"Microchannels made of fluoropolymers show potential merits due to their excellent solvent resistance, but such channels have not been widely used because of the complexity to fabricate them. This communication describes a method to prototype microfluidic devices using fluoropolymer films. The fabrication requires only two steps; cutting fluoropolymer films with a desktop cutting plotter and applying heat and pressure to laminate them. The method is rapid, simple, and low-cost. The conditions for heat press were identified for two common fluoropolymers: polytetrafluoroethylene and fluorinated ethylene propylene. The laminated films were confirmed to remain sealed with an internal pressure of at least 300 kPa. The fabricated devices were tested for the resistance to a set of organic solvents that would not be compatible with typical devices fabricated in polydimethylsiloxane. To highlight the potential of the fluoropolymer devices fabricated in this method, generation of droplets in a continuous stream of organic solvent using a T-junction channel was demonstrated. Our method offers a simple avenue to prototype microfluidic devices to conduct experiments involving organic solvents such as organic chemistry and in-channel synthesis of microparticles.",Microstencil-based spatial immobilization of individual cells for single cell analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867865,Biomicrofluidics,2019 03 29,"Cells exhibit biologically heterogeneous phenotypes, particularly in pathogenic states. To study cell behavior at the single cell level, a variety of micropatterning techniques have been proposed that allow the spatial organization of cells with great control over cell volume, morphology, and intercellular interactions. Among these strategies, microstencil patterning has traditionally been eschewed due to fragility of membranes and lack of control over cell configurations within patterns. Here, we present a simple and reproducible strategy to create robust microstencils and achieve consistent and efficient cell patterns requiring less than 4 μl of cell solution. Polydimethylsiloxane microstencils fabricated with this technique can be used dozens of times over the course of several months with minimal wear or degradation. Characterization of pattern size, cell suspension density, and droplet volume allows on-demand configurations of singlets, doublets, triplets, or multiple cells per individual space. In addition, a novel technique to suppress evaporative convection provides precise and repeatable results, with a twofold increase in patterning efficacy. Selective dual surface modification to create hydrophilic islands on a hydrophobic substrate facilitates a significantly longer and healthier lifespan of cells without crossover of pattern boundaries. The ability to pattern individual cells with or without an extracellular matrix substrate and to control the magnitude of cell-cell contact as well as spread area provides a powerful approach to monitoring cell functions such as proliferation and intercellular signaling.","Impact of poloxamer 188 (Pluronic F-68) additive on cell mechanical properties, quantification by real-time deformability cytometry.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867863,Biomicrofluidics,2019 03 29,"Advances in cellular therapies have led to the development of new approaches for cell product purification and formulation, e.g., utilizing cell endogenous properties such as size and deformability as a basis for separation from potentially harmful undesirable by-products. However, commonly used additives such as Pluronic F-68 and other poloxamer macromolecules can change the mechanical properties of cells and consequently alter their processing. In this paper, we quantified the short-term effect of Pluronic F-68 on the mechanotype of three different cell types (Jurkat cells, red blood cells, and human embryonic kidney cells) using real-time deformability cytometry. The impact of the additive concentration was assessed in terms of cell size and deformability. We observed that cells respond progressively to the presence of Pluronic F-68 within first 3 h of incubation and become significantly stiffer (p-value < 0.001) in comparison to a serum-free control and a control containing serum. We also observed that the short-term response manifested as cell stiffening is true (p-value < 0.001) for the concentration reaching 1% (w/v) of the poloxamer additive in tested buffers. Additionally, using flow cytometry, we assessed that changes in cell deformability triggered by addition of Pluronic F-68 are not accompanied by size or viability alterations.",High-throughput culture and embedment of spheroid array using droplet contact-based spheroid transfer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867862,Biomicrofluidics,2019 03 29,"Spheroids are one of the most representative models of 3D cell culture, which can be easily formed using conventional hanging drop method. However, medium change and spheroid transferring process are the bottlenecks that reduce the throughput of the entire process in the hanging drop culture. In addition, the embedment of spheroid into hydrogel still depends on the individual pipetting process. To overcome these issues, we present poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS)-based simple devices which can exploit droplet contact-based spheroid transfer using a drop array chip (DAC) having an array of well structures and peripheral rims. When the upper spheroid-containing drops were in contact with the lower liquid drops, the air-liquid interface disappeared at the merged surface and the spheroids settled down due to gravitational force. This method was applied to repetitive medium change and live/dead staining of spheroids cultured with the hanging drop method. To simultaneously embed the spheroids into the corresponding collagen hydrogel drops, a PDMS-based pillar array chip (PAC) was contacted in advance with the spheroid-containing DAC. The contacted PAC then contained the spheroids trapped in small drops of liquid reduced in volume to around 0.5 μl. Consequently, the spheroids were embedded into the collagen drops at once by contacting the spheroid-containing PAC with the collagen-loaded DAC. The embedded spheroids using the DAC-PAC contacting method showed a reliable invasion behavior compared to the embedded spheroids using conventional manual pipetting.",An artificial placenta type microfluidic blood oxygenator with double-sided gas transfer microchannels and its integration as a neonatal lung assist device.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867861,Biomicrofluidics,2019 03 29,"Preterm neonates suffering from respiratory distress syndrome require assistive support in the form of mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, which may lead to long-term complications or even death. Here, we describe a high performance artificial placenta type microfluidic oxygenator, termed as a double-sided single oxygenator unit (dsSOU), which combines microwire stainless-steel mesh reinforced gas permeable membranes on both sides of a microchannel network, thereby significantly reducing the diffusional resistance to oxygen uptake as compared to the previous single-sided oxygenator designs. The new oxygenator is designed to be operated in a pumpless manner, perfused solely due to the arterio-venous pressure difference in a neonate and oxygenate blood through exposure directly to ambient atmosphere without any air or oxygen pumping. The best performing dsSOUs showed up to ∼343% improvement in oxygen transfer compared to a single-sided SOU (ssSOU) with the same height. Later, the dsSOUs were optimized and integrated to build a lung assist device (LAD) that could support the oxygenation needs for a 1-2 kg neonate under clinically relevant conditions for the artificial placenta, namely, flow rates ranging from 10 to 60 ml/min and a pressure drop of 10-60 mmHg. The LAD provided an oxygen uptake of 0.78-2.86 ml/min, which corresponded to the increase in oxygen saturation from 57 ± 1% to 93%-100%, under pure oxygen environment. This microfluidic lung assist device combines elegant design with new microfabrication methods to develop a pumpless, microfluidic blood oxygenator that is capable of supporting 30% of the oxygen needs of a pre-term neonate.",Thermal sensing in fluid at the micro-nano-scales.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867860,Biomicrofluidics,2019 03 29,"Temperature is one of the most fundamental parameters for the characterization of a physical system. With rapid development of lab-on-a-chip and biology at single cell level, a great demand has risen for the temperature sensors with high spatial, temporal, and thermal resolution. Nevertheless, measuring temperature in liquid environment is always a technical challenge. Various factors may affect the sensing results, such as the fabrication parameters of built-in sensors, thermal property of electrical insulating layer, and stability of fluorescent thermometers in liquid environment. In this review, we focused on different kinds of micro/nano-thermometers applied in the thermal sensing for microfluidic systems and cultured cells. We discussed the advantages and limitations of these thermometers in specific applications and the challenges and possible solutions for more accurate temperature measurements in further studies.",Reconfiguring droplet interface bilayer networks through sacrificial membranes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867859,Biomicrofluidics,2019 06 12,"The droplet interface bilayer platform allows for the fabrication of stimuli-responsive microfluidic materials, using phospholipids as an organic surfactant in water-in-oil mixtures. In this approach, lipid-coated droplets are adhered together in arranged networks, forming lipid bilayer membranes with embedded transporters and establishing selective exchange pathways between neighboring aqueous subcompartments. The resulting material is a biologically inspired droplet-based material that exhibits emergent properties wherein different droplets accomplish different functions, similar to multicellular organisms. These networks have been successfully applied towards biomolecular sensing and energy harvesting applications. However, unlike their source of inspiration, these droplet structures are often static. This limitation not only renders the networks unable to adapt or modify their structure and function after formation but also limits their long term use as passive ionic exchange between neighboring droplet pairs may initiate immediately after the membranes are established. This work addresses this shortcoming by rupturing selected sacrificial membranes within the collections of droplets to rearrange the remaining droplets into new configurations, redirecting the droplet-droplet exchange pathways. This is accomplished through electrical shocks applied between selected droplets. Experimental outcomes are compared to predictions provided by a coupled mechanical-electrical model for the droplet networks, and then advanced configurations are proposed using this model.",Membrane isolation of repeated-use sweat stimulants for mitigating both direct dermal contact and sweat dilution.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867858,Biomicrofluidics,2019 05 01,"With the device integration of sweat stimulation, sweat becomes a stronger candidate for non-invasive continuous biochemical sensing. However, sweat stimulants are cholinergenic agents and non-selective to just the sweat glands, and so, direct placement of sweat stimulants poses additional challenges in the possibility for uncontrollable transport of the stimulant into the body and challenges in contamination of the sweat sample. Reported here is membrane isolation of repeated-use sweat stimulants for mitigating direct dermal contact, dilution of the sweat stimulant, and contamination of the sweat sample. The membrane dramatically reduces passive diffusion of the sweat stimulant carbachol by roughly two orders of magnitude, while still allowing repeated sweat stimulation by iontophoretic delivery of the carbachol through the membrane and into the skin. Both in-vivo and in-vitro validation reveal feasibility for reliable integration of sweat stimulants within a wearable device for use periods of 24 h or more. In addition, advanced topics and confounding issues such as stimulant gel design, osmotic pressure, and ionic impurities are speculatively and theoretically discussed."

In the present study we evaluated the utility of targeted imaging of active factor XIII (FXIII) for detection of coronary MVD associated with thrombus. We hypothesized that a high specificity and sensitivity FXIII targeted radiolabeled probe can serve as a biomarker for cross-linked thrombi in the microvasculature, and thus an indicator for underlying coronary MVD. To evaluate this approach, a coronary MVD model was established for local induction of singlet oxygen and reactive oxygen species (ROS) via a photochemical reaction (PCR). Methods: PCR was used to induce endothelial injury and microthrombi via focal over-production of ROS only in the coronary microvasculature. Oxidative stress was initially evaluated in primary coronary endothelial cells to optimize parameters of PCR, which were then translated to in vivo experiments. To develop the coronary MVD model, 64 mice were assigned to one of four groups after thoracotomy: 1) sham control; 2) rose bengal; 3) green light; or 4) their combination. Following interventions, the mice underwent transmission electron microscopy, fluorescent myocardial perfusion, coronary angiography, and immunohistochemical staining. Echocardiography (n = 12) and gene expression (n = 10) studies were also performed after MVD induction to monitor serial changes in cardiac function and explore possible mechanisms. To diagnose early onset MVD, FXIII radioactivity was assessed in 104 mice using ex vivo gamma well counting (GWC) and in 14 mice using in vivo serial single photon emission computed tomography / computed tomography (SPECT/CT) imaging of a FXIII targeted technetium-labeled probe (99mTc-NC100668). Results:In vitro experiments demonstrated that photosensitizer concentration and light illumination time were critical parameters for PCR. In vivo experiments demonstrated manifestations of clinical MVD, including endothelial damage, a ""no flow zone,"" arteriole rarefaction with patent epicardial coronary arteries, infiltration of inflammatory cells in the PCR-treated region, and preserved cardiac function. Gene expression also demonstrated a pro-thrombotic and impaired fibrinolytic status. In the early stages of MVD, enhanced FXIII activity was confirmed within the MVD region using GWC and in vivo SPECT/CT imaging. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that molecular imaging of FXIII activity may allow for early detection of coronary MVD associated with thrombus, in a novel pre-clinical model.",Oncogenic MSH6-CXCR4-TGFB1 Feedback Loop: A Novel Therapeutic Target of Photothermal Therapy in Glioblastoma Multiforme.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867843,Theranostics,2019 03 29,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) has been considered the most aggressive glioma type. Temozolomide (TMZ) is the main first-line chemotherapeutic agent for GBM. Decreased mutS homolog 6 (MSH6) expression is clinically recognized as one of the principal reasons for GBM resistance to TMZ. However, the specific functions of MSH6 in GBM, in addition to its role in mismatch repair, remain unknown. Methods: Bioinformatics were employed to analyze MSH6 mRNA and protein levels in GBM clinical samples and to predict the potential cancer-promoting functions and mechanisms of MSH6. MSH6 levels were silenced or overexpressed in GBM cells to assess its functional effects in vitro and in vivo. Western blot, qRT-PCR, and immunofluorescence assays were used to explore the relevant molecular mechanisms. Cu2(OH)PO4@PAA nanoparticles were fabricated through a hydrothermal method. Their MRI and photothermal effects as well as their effect on restraining the MSH6-CXCR4-TGFB1 feedback loop were investigated in vitro and in vivo. Results: We demonstrated that MSH6 is an overexpressed oncogene in human GBM tissues. MSH6, CXCR4 and TGFB1 formed a triangular MSH6-CXCR4-TGFB1 feedback loop that accelerated gliomagenesis, proliferation (G1 phase), migration and invasion (epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition; EMT), stemness, angiogenesis and antiapoptotic effects by regulating the p-STAT3/Slug and p-Smad2/3/ZEB2 signaling pathways in GBM. In addition, the MSH6-CXCR4-TGFB1 feedback loop was a vital marker of GBM, making it a promising therapeutic target. Notably, photothermal therapy (PTT) mediated by Cu2(OH)PO4@PAA + near infrared (NIR) irradiation showed outstanding therapeutic effects, which might be associated with a repressed MSH6-CXCR4-TGFB1 feedback loop and its downstream factors in GBM. Simultaneously, the prominent MR imaging (T1WI) ability of Cu2(OH)PO4@PAA could provide visual guidance for PTT. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that the oncogenic MSH6-CXCR4-TGFB1 feedback loop is a novel therapeutic target for GBM and that PTT is associated with the inhibition of the MSH6-CXCR4-TGFB1 loop.",Evaluation of Polymer Nanoformulations in Hepatoma Therapy by Established Rodent Models.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867842,Theranostics,2019 03 29,"Hepatoma is one of the most severe malignancies usually with poor prognosis, and many patients are insensitive to the existing therapeutic agents, including the drugs for chemotherapy and molecular targeted therapy. Currently, researchers are committed to developing the advanced formulations with controlled drug delivery to improve the efficacy of hepatoma therapy. Numerous inoculated, induced, and genetically engineered hepatoma rodent models are now available for formulation screening. However, animal models of hepatoma cannot accurately represent human hepatoma in terms of histological characteristics, metastatic pathways, and post-treatment responses. Therefore, advanced animal hepatoma models with comparable pathogenesis and pathological features are in urgent need in the further studies. Moreover, the development of nanomedicines has renewed hope for chemotherapy and molecular targeted therapy of advanced hepatoma. As one kind of advanced formulations, the polymer-based nanoformulated drugs have many advantages over the traditional ones, such as improved tumor selectivity and treatment efficacy, and reduced systemic side effects. In this article, the construction of rodent hepatoma model and much information about the current development of polymer nanomedicines were reviewed in order to provide a basis for the development of advanced formulations with clinical therapeutic potential for hepatoma.",Microfluidic Isolation of Circulating Tumor Cells and Cancer Stem-Like Cells from Patients with Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867841,Theranostics,2019 03 29,"Background: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) requires multimodal therapeutic approaches and disease monitoring for effective treatment. Liquid biopsy biomarkers, including circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and cancer stem-like cells (CSCs), hold promise for evaluating treatment response promptly and guiding therapeutic modifications. Methods: From 24 patients with metastatic PDAC (stage IV, M1) undergoing active systemic treatment, we collected 78 blood samples at different time points for CTC and CSC isolation using a microfluidic platform functionalized with antibodies against a CTC biomarker, epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM), or a CSC biomarker, CD133. These isolated cells were further verified, via fluorescent staining and imaging, using cytokeratin (CK), CD45, and nucleic acid stain 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). Results: The majority (84.4%) of patient blood samples were positive for CTCs (EpCAM+CK+CD45-DAPI+) and 70.8% of patient blood samples were positive for CSCs (CD133+CK+CD45-DAPI+), using the highest baseline value of healthy samples as threshold. The CTC subtypes (EpCAM+CK+CD45-DAPI+CD133+ and EpCAM+CK+CD45-DAPI+CD133-) and CSC subtypes (CD133+CK+CD45-DAPI+EpCAM+ and CD133+CK+CD45-DAPI+EpCAM-) were also analyzed using immunochemical methods. In several cases, CSCs exhibited cytokeratin expression that did not express EpCAM, indicating that they will not be detected using EpCAM-based isolation. Conclusion: The microfluidic platform enabled the reliable isolation of CTCs and CSCs from PDAC patient samples, as well as their subtypes. Complementary assessment of both CTCs and CSCs appears advantageous to assess the profile of tumor progressing in some cases. This research has important implications for the application and interpretation of approved methods to detect CTCs.",Transcriptional Downregulation of miR-4306 serves as a New Therapeutic Target for Triple Negative Breast Cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867840,Theranostics,2019 03 29,"Rationale: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is characterized by the absence of estrogen receptor alpha (ER-α), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) and progesterone receptor (PR) expression, but the effect of lacking the three factors on TNBC is unclear. Whether loss of the three factors contributes to deregulate genes that participate in the progress of TNBC remains unknown. Methods: We performed microRNA arrays and comprehensive analysis to screen for miRNAs that are transcriptionally regulated by ER-α, HER2 and PR. Functional assays and molecular mechanism studies were used to investigate the role of miR-4306 in TNBC. An orthotopic mouse model of TNBC was used to evaluate the therapeutic potential of a cholesterol-conjugated miR-4306 mimic. Results: We found that miR-4306 is transcriptionally regulated by ER-α, HER2 and PR, and the downregulation of miR-4306 in TNBC is caused by the loss of ER-α, HER2 and PR. Clinically, low miR-4306 expression is strongly associated with lymph node metastasis and poor survival for TNBC. Upregulation of miR-4306 greatly suppresses TNBC cell proliferation, migration and invasion and abrogates angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis in vitro. According to in vivo models, miR-4306 overexpression considerably inhibits TNBC growth, lung metastasis, angiogenesis and lymph node metastasis. Mechanistic analyses indicate that miR-4306 directly targets SIX1/Cdc42/VEGFA to inactivate the signaling pathways mediated by SIX1/Cdc42/VEGFA. Finally, the orthotopic mouse model of TNBC reveals that miR-4306 mimic can be used for TNBC treatment in combination with cisplatin. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that miR-4306 acts as a tumor suppressor in TNBC and is a potential therapeutic target for TNBC treatment.",ClC-7 Regulates the Pattern and Early Development of Craniofacial Bone and Tooth.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867839,Theranostics,2019 03 29,"Human CLCN7 encodes voltage-gated chloride channel 7 (ClC-7); mutations of CLCN7 lead to osteopetrosis which is characterized by increased bone mass and impaired osteoclast function. In our previous clinical practice, we noticed that osteopetrosis patients with CLCN7 mutations had some special deformities in craniofacial morphology and tooth dysplasia. It is unclear whether these phenotypes are the typical features of CLCN7 involved osteopetrosis and whether ClC-7 could regulate the development of craniofacial bone and tooth in some signaling pathways. Methods: First, we collected 80 osteopetrosis cases from the literature and compared their craniofacial and dental phenotypes. Second, four osteopetrosis pedigrees with CLCN7 mutations were recruited from our clinic for gene testing and clinical analysis of their craniofacial and dental phenotypes. Third, we used a zebrafish model with clcn7 morpholino treatment to detect the effects of ClC-7 deficiency on the development of craniofacial and dental phenotypes. General observation, whole mount alcian blue and alizarin red staining, whole mount in situ hybridization, scanning electron microscope observation, lysoSensor staining, Q-PCR and western blotting were performed to observe the in vivo characteristics of craniofacial bone and tooth changes. Fourth, mouse marrow stromal cells were further primarily cultured to detect ClC-7 related mRNA and protein changes using siRNA, Q-PCR and western blotting. Results: Over 84% of osteopetrosis patients in the literature had some typical craniofacial and tooth phenotypes, including macrocephaly, frontal bossing, and changes in shape and proportions of facial skeleton, and these unique features are more severe and frequent in autosomal recessive osteopetrosis than in autosomal dominant osteopetrosis patients. Our four pedigrees with CLCN7 mutations confirmed the aforementioned clinical features. clcn7 knockdown in zebrafish reproduced the craniofacial cartilage defects and various dental malformations combined the decreased levels of col10a1, sp7, dlx2b, eve1, and cx43. Loss of clcn7 function resulted in lysosomal storage in the brain and jaw as well as downregulated cathepsin K (CTSK). The craniofacial phenotype severity also presented a dose-dependent relationship with the levels of ClC-7 and CTSK. ClC-7/CTSK further altered the balance of TGF-β/BMP signaling pathway, causing elevated TGF-β-like Smad2 signals and reduced BMP-like Smad1/5/8 signals in clcn7 morphants. SB431542 inhibitor of TGF-β pathway partially rescued the aforementioned craniofacial bone and tooth defects of clcn7 morphants. The ClC-7 involved CTSK/BMP and SMAD changes were also confirmed in mouse bone marrow stromal cells. Conclusion: These findings highlighted the vital role of clcn7 in zebrafish craniofacial bone and tooth development and mineralization, revealing novel insights for the causation of osteopetrosis with CLCN7 mutations. The mechanism chain of ClC-7/CTSK/ TGF-β/BMP/SMAD might explain the typical craniofacial bone and tooth changes in osteopetrosis as well as pycnodysostosis patients.",Absence of GdX/UBL4A Protects against Inflammatory Diseases by Regulating NF-кB Signaling in Macrophages and Dendritic Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867837,Theranostics,2019 03 29,"Nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) activation is critical for innate immune responses. However, cellular-intrinsic regulation of NF-κB activity during inflammatory diseases remains incompletely understood. Ubiquitin-like protein 4A (UBL4A, GdX) is a small adaptor protein involved in protein folding, biogenesis and transcription. Yet, whether GdX has a role during innate immune response is largely unknown. Methods: To investigate the involvement of GdX in innate immunity, we challenged GdX-deficient mice with lipopolysaccharides (LPS). To investigate the underlying mechanism, we performed RNA sequencing, real-time PCR, ELISA, luciferase reporter assay, immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analyses, flow cytometry, and structure analyses. To investigate whether GdX functions in inflammatory bowel disease, we generated dendritic cell (DC), macrophage (Mφ), epithelial-cell specific GdX-deficient mice and induced colitis with dextran sulfate sodium. Results: GdX enhances DC and Mφ-mediated innate immune defenses by positively regulating NF-κB signaling. GdX-deficient mice were resistant to LPS-induced endotoxin shock and DSS-induced colitis. DC- or Mφ- specific GdX-deficient mice displayed alleviated mucosal inflammation. The production of pro-inflammatory cytokines by GdX-deficient DCs and Mφ was reduced. Mechanistically, we found that tyrosine-protein phosphatase non-receptor type 2 (PTPN2, TC45) and protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) form a complex with RelA (p65) to mediate its dephosphorylation whereas GdX interrupts the TC45/PP2A/p65 complex formation and restrict p65 dephosphorylation by trapping TC45. Conclusion: Our study provides a mechanism by which NF-κB signaling is positively regulated by an adaptor protein GdX in DC or Mφ to maintain the innate immune response. Targeting GdX could be a strategy to reduce over-activated immune response in inflammatory diseases.",A Logic-Gated Modular Nanovesicle Enables Programmable Drug Release for On-Demand Chemotherapy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867836,Theranostics,2019 03 29,"It remains a major challenge to achieve precise on-demand drug release. Here, we developed a modular nanomedicine integrated with logic-gated system enabling programmable drug release for on-demand chemotherapy. Methods: We employed two different logical AND gates consisting of four interrelated moieties to construct the nanovesicles, denoted as v-A-CED2, containing oxidation-responsive nanovesicles (v), radical generators (A), and Edman linker conjugated prodrugs (CED2). The first AND logic gate is connected in parallel by mild hyperthermia ( 
I
 ) and acidic pH ( 
II
 ), which executes NIR laser triggered prodrug-to-drug transformation through Edman degradation. Meanwhile, the mild hyperthermia effect triggers alkyl radical generation ( 
III
 ) which contributes to internal oxidation and degradation of nanovesicles ( 
IV
 ). The second AND logic gate is therefore formed by the combination of 
I-IV
 to achieve programmable drug release by a single stimulus input NIR laser. The biodistribution of the nanovesicles was monitored by positron emission tomography (PET), photoacoustic, and fluorescence imaging. Results: The developed modular nanovesicles exhibited high tumor accumulation and effective anticancer effects both in vitro and in vivo. Conclusions: This study provides a novel paradigm of logic-gated programmable drug release system by a modular nanovesicle, which may shed light on innovation of anticancer agents and strategies.",Real-Time Monitoring of Pharmacokinetics of Antibiotics in Biofilms with Raman-Tagged Hyperspectral Stimulated Raman Scattering Microscopy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867835,Theranostics,2019 03 29,"Antibiotics resistance developed by biofilms has posed a clinical challenge in the effective treatment of bacterial infections. However, the resistance mechanisms have not been well understood due to a lack of suitable tools for dynamic observation of the interplay between antibiotics and biofilm. In this work, with the use of rapid hyperspectral stimulated Raman scattering microscopy associated with an aryl-alkyne-based Raman tag synthesized, we investigate dynamic interactions between vancomycin and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) biofilm to gain new insights into the resistance mechanisms of the biofilm. Methods: We utilize spectral focusing hyperspectral stimulated Raman scattering microscopy ensued with multivariate curve resolution analysis to spectrally decompose S. aureus biofilm into its major components (i.e., bacteria and extracellular polymeric substances). Concurrently, vancomycin is conjugated with aryl-alkyne Raman tag (Raman peak at 2218 cm-1) for in vivo tracking of its uptake into biofilm without tissue interference. Results: We find that vancomycin penetration is a non-uniform diffusion process with penetration depths limited by the preferential affinity to the cell clusters. Semi-quantitative analysis shows that the majority of vancomycin binds to the bacteria, achieving intracellular concentrations of up to 4- to 10- fold higher than the administered dosage. The diffusion constant of ~3.16 µm2/min based on the diffusion and antibiotic binding equations is obtained that well accounts for the antibiotic penetration into the biofilm. SRS longitudinal monitoring of antibiotic effect on the growth of biofilms shows that the antibiotics can eradicate the upper layer of the biofilm exposed to sufficient dosages, while the lower layer of the biofilm at a sub-inhibitory dose remains viable, eventually re-growing to significant bio-volume. Conclusion: The Raman-tagged hyperspectral SRS microscopy developed is a powerful imaging tool for dynamic monitoring of inhibitory effects of antibiotics on the growing biofilm in vivo, which would facilitate the formulation of new antibiotics for more effective treatments of bacterial infections in near future.","Nanoliposomes Co-Encapsulating CT Imaging Contrast Agent and Photosensitizer for Enhanced, Imaging Guided Photodynamic Therapy of Cancer.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867833,Theranostics,2019 03 29,"Fluorescence (FL) and X-ray computed tomography (CT) imaging-guided photodynamic therapy (PDT) can provide a powerful theranostic tool to visualize, monitor, and treat cancer and other diseases with enhanced accuracy and efficacy. Methods: In this study, clinically approved iodinated CT imaging contrast agent (CTIA) iodixanol and commercially available photosensitizer (PS) meso-tetrakis (4-sulphonatophenyl) porphine (TPPS4) were co-encapsulated in biocompatible PEGylated nanoliposomes (NL) for enhanced anticancer PDT guided by bimodal (FL and CT) imaging. Results: The NL co-encapsulation of iodixanol and TPPS4 (LIT) lead to an increase in singlet oxygen generation by PS via the intraparticle heavy-atom (iodine) effect on PS molecules, as it was confirmed by both direct and indirect measurements of singlet oxygen production. The confocal imaging and PDT of cancer cells were performed in vitro, exhibiting the cellular uptake of TPPS4 formulations and enhanced PDT efficacy of LIT. Meanwhile, bimodal (FL and CT) imaging was also conducted with tumor-bearing mice and the imaging results manifested high-efficient accumulation and retention of LIT in tumors. Moreover, PDT of tumor in vivo was shown to be drastically more efficient with LIT than with other formulations of TPPS4. Conclusion: This study demonstrated that LIT can serve as a highly efficient theranostic nanoplatform for enhanced anticancer PDT guided by bimodal (FL and CT) imaging."

Hypothesizing that activated platelets in the tumor microenvironment provide a targeting epitope for tumor-directed chemotherapy, we developed an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC), comprised of a single-chain antibody (scFv) against the platelet integrin GPIIb/IIIa (scFvGPIIb/IIIa) linked to the potent chemotherapeutic microtubule inhibitor, monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE). Methods: We developed an ADC comprised of three components: 1) A scFv which specifically binds to the high affinity, activated integrin GPIIb/IIIa on activated platelets. 2) A highly potent microtubule inhibitor, monomethyl auristatin E. 3) A drug activation/release mechanism using a linker cleavable by cathepsin B, which we demonstrate to be abundant in the tumor microenvironment. The scFvGPIIb/IIIa-MMAE was first conjugated with Cyanine7 for in vivo imaging. The therapeutic efficacy of the scFvGPIIb/IIIa-MMAE was then tested in a mouse metastasis model of triple negative breast cancer. Results: In vitro studies confirmed that this ADC specifically binds to activated GPIIb/IIIa, and cathepsin B-mediated drug release/activation resulted in tumor cytotoxicity. In vivo fluorescence imaging demonstrated that the newly generated ADC localized to primary tumors and metastases in a mouse xenograft model of triple negative breast cancer, a difficult to treat tumor for which a selective tumor-targeting therapy remains to be clinically established. Importantly, we demonstrated that the scFvGPIIb/IIIa-MMAE displays marked efficacy as an anti-cancer agent, reducing tumor growth and preventing metastatic disease, without any discernible toxic effects. Conclusion: Here, we demonstrate the utility of a novel ADC that targets a potent cytotoxic drug to activated platelets and specifically releases the cytotoxic agent within the confines of the tumor. This unique targeting mechanism, specific to the tumor microenvironment, holds promise as a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of a broad range of primary tumors and metastatic disease, particularly for tumors that lack specific molecular epitopes for drug targeting.",Microporous polysaccharide multilayer coated BCP composite scaffolds with immobilised calcitriol promote osteoporotic bone regeneration both in vitro and in vivo.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867820,Theranostics,2019 03 29,"Incorporating a biomimetic coating and integrating osteoinductive biomolecules into basic bone substitutes are two common strategies to improve osteogenic capabilities in bone tissue engineering. Currently, the underlying mechanism of osteoporosis (OP)-related deficiency of osteogenesis remains unclear, and few treatments target at OP-related bone regeneration. Herein, we describe a self-assembling polyelectrolyte multilayered (PEM) film coating with local immobilisation of calcitriol (Cal) in biphasic calcium phosphate (BCP) scaffolds to promote osteoporotic bone regeneration by targeting the calcium sensing receptor (CaSR). Methods: The ovariectomy-induced functional changes in bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs), protective effects of Cal, and the potential mechanism were all verified. A PEM film composed of hyaluronic acid (HA) and chitosan (Chi) was prepared through layer-by-layer self-assembly. The morphology, growth behaviour, and drug retention capability of the composite scaffolds were characterised, and their biocompatibility and therapeutic efficacy for bone regeneration were systematically explored in vitro and in vivo.Results: The osteogenic differentiation, adhesion, and proliferation abilities of ovariectomised rat BMSCs (OVX-rBMSCs) decreased, in accordance with the deficiency of CaSR. Cal effectively activated osteogenesis in these OVX-rBMSCs by binding specifically to the active pocket of the CaSR structure, while the biomimetic PEM coating augmented OVX-rBMSCs proliferation and adhesion due to its porous surface structure. The PEM-coated scaffolds showed advantages in Cal loading and retention, especially at lower drug concentrations. HA/Chi PEM synergised with Cal to improve the proliferation, adhesion, and osteogenesis of OVX-rBMSCs and promote bone regeneration and BCP degradation in the critical-size calvarial bone defect model of OVX rats. Conclusion: A composite scaffold based on BCP, created by simply combining a biomimetic PEM coating and Cal immobilisation, could be clinically useful and has marked advantages as a targeted, off-the-shelf, cell-free treatment option for osteoporotic bone regeneration.",Genome-wide profiling of Epstein-Barr virus integration by targeted sequencing in Epstein-Barr virus associated malignancies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867819,Theranostics,2019 03 29,"Rationale: Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is associated with multiple malignancies with expression of viral oncogenic proteins and chronic inflammation as major mechanisms contributing to tumor development. A less well-studied mechanism is the integration of EBV into the human genome possibly at sites which may disrupt gene expression or genome stability. Methods: We sequenced tumor DNA to profile the EBV sequences by hybridization-based enrichment. Bioinformatic analysis was used to detect the breakpoints of EBV integrations in the genome of cancer cells. Results: We identified 197 breakpoints in nasopharyngeal carcinomas and other EBV-associated malignancies. EBV integrations were enriched at vulnerable regions of the human genome and were close to tumor suppressor and inflammation-related genes. We found that EBV integrations into the introns could decrease the expression of the inflammation-related genes, TNFAIP3, PARK2, and CDK15, in NPC tumors. In the EBV genome, the breakpoints were frequently at oriP or terminal repeats. These breakpoints were surrounded by microhomology sequences, consistent with a mechanism for integration involving viral genome replication and microhomology-mediated recombination. Conclusion: Our finding provides insight into the potential of EBV integration as an additional mechanism mediating tumorigenesis in EBV associated malignancies.",Interaction between p53 and Ras signaling controls cisplatin resistance via HDAC4- and HIF-1α-mediated regulation of apoptosis and autophagy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867818,Theranostics,2019 03 29,"The interplay between p53 and RAS signaling regulates cancer chemoresistance, but the detailed mechanism is unclear. In this study, we investigated the interactive effects of p53 and RAS on ovarian cancer cisplatin resistance to explore the potential therapeutic targets. Methods: An inducible p53 and RAS mutants active in either MAPK/ERK (S35 and E38) or PI3K/AKT (C40) or both (V12) were sequentially introduced into a p53-null ovarian cancer cell line-SKOV3. Comparative microarray analysis was performed using Gene Chip Prime View Human Gene Expression arrays (Affymetrix). In vitro assays of autophagy and apoptosis and in vivo animal experiments were performed by p53 induction and/or cisplatin treatment using the established cell lines. The correlation between HDAC4 and HIF-1α or CREBZF and the association of HDAC4, HIF-1α, CREBZF, ERK, AKT, and p53 mRNA levels with patient survival in 523 serous ovarian cancer cases from TCGA was assessed. Results: We show that p53 and RAS mutants differentially control cellular apoptosis and autophagy to inhibit or to promote chemoresistance through dysregulation of Bax, Bcl2, ATG3, and ATG12. ERK and AKT active RAS mutants are mutually suppressive to confer or to deprive cisplatin resistance. Further studies demonstrate that p53 induces HIF-1α degradation and HDAC4 cytoplasmic translocation and phosphorylation. S35, E38, and V12 but not C40 promote HDAC4 phosphorylation and its cytoplasmic translocation along with HIF-1α. Wild-type p53 expression in RAS mutant cells enhances HIF-1α turnover in ovarian and lung cancer cells. Autophagy and anti-apoptotic processes can be promoted by the overexpression and cytoplasmic translocation of HDAC4 and HIF1-α. Moreover, the phosphorylation and cytoplasmic translocation of HDAC4 activate the transcription factor CREBZF to promote ATG3 transcription. High HDAC4 or CREBZF expression predicted poor overall survival (OS) and/or progression-free survival (PFS) in ovarian cancer patients, whereas high HIF-1α expression was statistically correlated with poor or good OS depending on p53 status. Conclusion: HIF-1α and HDAC4 may mediate the interaction between p53 and RAS signaling to actively control ovarian cancer cisplatin resistance through dysregulation of apoptosis and autophagy. Targeting HDAC4, HIF-1α and CREBZF may be considered in treatment of ovarian cancer with p53 and RAS mutations.","Zwitterionic near-infrared fluorophore-conjugated epidermal growth factor for fast, real-time, and target-cell-specific cancer imaging.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867817,Theranostics,2019 03 29,"Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is overexpressed in many types of cancers, which is associated with metastatic potential and poor prognosis in cancer patients. Therefore, development of EGFR-targeted sensitive imaging probes has been a challenge in tumor targeting, image-guided cancer surgery, patient-selective anti-EGFR therapy, and efficient targeted therapies. Methods: We synthesized a zwitterionic near-infrared fluorophore (ATTO655)-conjugated epidermal growth factor (EGF) as a novel activatable molecular probe. Fluorescence OFF/ON property and EGFR-targeting specificity of EGF-ATTO655 as well as its utility in real-time near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence imaging of EGFR-positive cancers were evaluated using in vitro and in vivo studies. Results: When conjugated to EGF, the fluorescence of ATTO655 quenched efficiently by photo-induced electron transfer (PET) mechanism between the conjugated dyes and nearby amino acid quenchers (tryptophan/tyrosine residues), which was stably maintained at physiological pH and in the presence of serum for at least 17 h. The fluorescence of EGF-ATTO655 turned on by receptor-mediated endocytosis and subsequent disintegration of EGF in EGFR-positive A431 cancer cells, thereby enabling specific and real-time fluorescence imaging of EGFR-positive cancer cells. Consequently, EGFR-positive tumors could be clearly visualized 3 h post-injection with a significantly high tumor-to-background ratio (TBR = 6.37). Conclusion: This PET mechanism-based OFF/ON type of EGF probe showed great potential for rapid, real-time, and target-cell-specific imaging of EGFR-overexpressing cancers in vitro and in vivo.",Nrf2 signaling and inflammation are key events in physical plasma-spurred wound healing.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867816,Theranostics,2019 03 29,"Wound healing is strongly associated with the presence of a balanced content of reactive species in which oxygen-dependent, redox-sensitive signaling represents an essential step in the healing cascade. Numerous studies have demonstrated that cold physical plasma supports wound healing due to its ability to deliver a beneficial mixture of reactive species directly to the cells. Methods: We described a preclinical proof-of-principle-concept of cold plasma use in a dermal, full-thickness wound model in immunocompetent SKH1 mice. Quantitative PCR, Western blot analysis, immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence were perfomed to evaluate the expression and cellular translocation of essential targets of Nrf2 and p53 signaling as well as immunomodulatory and angiogenetic factors. Apoptosis and proliferation were detected using TUNEL assay and Ki67 staining, respectively. Cytokine levels in serum were measured using bead-based multiplex cytokine analysis. Epidermal keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts were isolated from mouse skin to perform functional knockdown experiments. Intravital fluorescence analysis was used to illustrate and quantified microvascular features. Results: Plasma exerted significant effects on wound healing in mice, including the promotion of granulation and reepithelialization as a consequence of the migration of skin cells, the balance of antioxidant and inflammatory response, and the early induction of macrophage and neutrophil recruitment to the wound sites. Moreover, through an early and local plasma-induced p53 inhibition with a concomitant stimulation of proliferation, the upregulation of angiogenetic factors, and an increased outgrowth of new vessels, our findings explain why dermal skin repair is accelerated. The cellular redox homeostasis was maintained and cells were defended from damage by a strong modulation of the nuclear E2-related factor (Nrf2) pathway and redox-sensitive p53 signaling. Conclusions: Although acute wound healing is non-problematic, the pathways highlighted that mainly the activation of Nrf2 signaling is a promising strategy for the clinical use of cold plasma in chronic wound healing.",GSH-sensitive Pt(IV) prodrug-loaded phase-transitional nanoparticles with a hybrid lipid-polymer shell for precise theranostics against ovarian cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867815,Theranostics,2019 03 29,"Background: Platinum (II) (Pt(II))-based anticancer drugs dominate the chemotherapy field of ovarian cancer. However, the patient's quality of life has severely limited owing to dose-limiting toxicities and the advanced disease at the time of diagnosis. Multifunctional tumor-targeted nanosized ultrasound contrast agents (glutathione (GSH)-sensitive platinum (IV) (Pt(IV)) prodrug-loaded phase-transitional nanoparticles, Pt(IV) NP-cRGD) were developed for precise theranostics against ovarian cancer. Methods: Pt(IV) NP-cRGD were composed of a perfluorohexane (PFH) liquid core, a hybrid lipid-polymer shell with PLGA12k-PEG2k and DSPE-PEG1k-Pt(IV), and an active targeting ligand, the cRGD peptide (PLGA: poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid), PEG: polyethylene glycol, DSPE: 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine, cRGD: cyclic Arg-Gly-Asp). Pt(IV), a popular alternative to Pt(II), was covalently attached to DSPE-PEG1k to form the prodrug, which fine-tuned lipophilicity and improved cellular uptake. The potential of Pt(IV) NP-cRGD as contrast agents for ultrasound (US) imaging was assessed in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, studies on the antitumor efficiency and antitumor mechanism of Pt(IV) NP-cRGD assisted by US were carried out. Results: Pt(IV) NP-cRGD exhibited strong echogenic signals and excellent echo persistence under an US field. In addition, the GSH-sensitive and US-triggered drug delivery system maximized the therapeutic effect while reducing the toxicity of chemotherapy. The mechanistic studies confirmed that Pt(IV) NP-cRGD with US consumed GSH and enhanced reactive oxy gen species (ROS) levels, which further causes mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. Conclusion: A multifunctional nanoplatform based on phase-transitional Pt(IV) NP-cRGD with US exhibited excellent echogenic signals, brilliant therapeutic efficacy and limited side effect, suggesting precise theranostics against ovarian cancer.",Human parthenogenetic neural stem cell grafts promote multiple regenerative processes in a traumatic brain injury model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867814,Theranostics,2019 03 29,"International Stem Cell Corporation human parthenogenetic neural stem cells (ISC-hpNSC) have potential therapeutic value for patients suffering from traumatic brain injury (TBI). Here, we demonstrate the behavioral and histological effects of transplanting ISC-hpNSC intracerebrally in an animal model of TBI. Methods: Sprague-Dawley rats underwent a moderate controlled cortical impact TBI surgery. Transplantation occurred at 72 h post-TBI with functional readouts of behavioral and histological deficits conducted during the subsequent 3-month period after TBI. We characterized locomotor, neurological, and cognitive performance at baseline (before TBI), then on days 0, 1, 7, 14, 30, 60, and 90 (locomotor and neurological), and on days 28-30, 58-60, and 88-90 (cognitive) after TBI. Following completion of behavioral testing at 3 months post-TBI, animals were euthanized by transcardial perfusion and brains harvested to histologically characterize the extent of brain damage. Neuronal survival was revealed by Nissl staining, and stem cell engraftment and host tissue repair mechanisms such as the anti-inflammatory response in peri-TBI lesion areas were examined by immunohistochemical analyses. Results: We observed that TBI groups given high and moderate doses of ISC-hpNSC had an improved swing bias on an elevated body swing test for motor function, increased scores on forelimb akinesia and paw grasp neurological tests, and committed significantly fewer errors on a radial arm water maze test for cognition. Furthermore, histological analyses indicated that high and moderate doses of stem cells increased the expression of phenotypic markers related to the neural lineage and myelination and decreased reactive gliosis and inflammation in the brain, increased neuronal survival in the peri-impact area of the cortex, and decreased inflammation in the spleen at 90 days post-TBI. Conclusion: These results provide evidence that high and moderate doses of ISC-hpNSC ameliorate TBI-associated histological alterations and motor, neurological, and cognitive deficits.",Design strategies and application progress of therapeutic exosomes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867813,Theranostics,2019 03 29,"Exosomes have great potential to be drug delivery vehicles due to their natural material transportation properties, intrinsic long-term circulatory capability, and excellent biocompatibility, which are suitable for delivering a variety of chemicals, proteins, nucleic acids, and gene therapeutic agents. However, an effective method of loading specific protein agents into exosomes for absorption by target cells is still lacking. The application potential of exosome is still limited. In this review, we discussed the methods for loading specific treating molecules (proteins, nucleic acids and small chemicals) into exosomes, the design strategies for cell and tissue targeting, and the factors for exosome formation. This review can be used as a reference for further research as well as for the development of therapeutic exosomes.",Tumor-secreted dickkopf2 accelerates aerobic glycolysis and promotes angiogenesis in colorectal cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867812,Theranostics,2019 03 29,"Angiogenesis is a fundamental process that involves in tumor progression and metastasis. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family and their receptors are identified as the most prominent regulators of angiogenesis. However, the clinical efficacy of anti-VEGF/VEGFR therapy is not ideal, prompting the needs to further understand mechanisms behind tumor angiogenesis. Here, we found that Dickkopf associated protein 2 (DKK2), a secretory protein highly expressed in metastatic colorectal cancer tissues, could stimulate angiogenesis via a classic VEGF/VEGFR independent pathway. Methods: DKK2 was screened out from microarray data analyzing gene expression profiles of eight pairs of non-metastatic and metastatic human colorectal cancer (CRC) tissues. Immunofluorescence histochemical staining (IHC) was used to detect the expression of DKK2 and angiogenesis in CRC tissues. Chicken chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay and Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) tubule formation assay was used for in vitro and in vivo angiogenesis study, respectively. Lactate and glucose concentration in the culture medium was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Luciferase reporter assay was used to verify the interaction between miR-493-5p and the 3'UTR of DKK2. Results: DKK2 could stimulate angiogenesis via accelerating the aerobic glycolysis of CRC cells, through which lactate is produced from glucose and accumulated in tumor microenvironment. Lactate functions as the final executor of DDK2 to stimulate tube formation of endothelial cells, and blockage of lactate secretion by lactate transporter (MCT) inhibitors dramatically neutralize the progression and metastasis of CRC both in vitro and in vivo. DKK2 could cooperate with lipoprotein receptor-related protein 6, which is required for glucose uptake, and activated the downstream mTOR signal pathway to accelerate lactate secretion. In addition, the expression of DKK2 is switched on via the demethylation of miR-493-5p, which allows the dissociated of miR-493-5p from the 3'-UTRs of DKK2 and initiates its stimulatory role on CRC progression in an autocrine or paracrine manner. Conclusion: DKK2 promotes tumor metastasis and angiogenesis through a novel VEGF-independent, but energy metabolism related pathway. DKK2 might be a potential anti-angiogenic target in clinical treatment for the advanced CRC patients."

We report a case of one patient, who was successfully treated with gemcitabine-platin based chemotherapy for polymetastatic renal CDC, and experienced a late and prolonged complete remission. In June 2014, a 69-year-old male patient was diagnosed with non-metastatic renal CDC. Nephrouretectomy was firstly performed. In December 2014, he developed a loco-regional recurrence with bilateral lung metastases. The patient started a course of gemcitabine-carboplatin (GC)-based first-line chemotherapy and received 6 cycles, which ended in May 2015. Computed tomography (CT) scan evaluation displayed an objective response according to RECIST 1.1 criteria and a follow-up of the patient was conducted. In August 2015, he had a second local relapse with new lung metastases. Despite a short disease-free interval, 6 cycles of the same GC regimen were required, which ended in February 2016. The patient firstly exhibited a partial objective response after the first 3 cycles and a stable disease at the end of chemotherapy. During the follow-up, a CT scan of his chest, abdomen and pelvis was performed every 3 months. From September 2016 to May 2017, despite no new specific treatments for his metastatic disease, the patient again experienced an objective and confirmed response on each CT-scan evaluation until complete remission in May 2017. This case report highlights the efficacy of GC-based chemotherapy, which is able to provide a durable and sometimes complete response in metastatic renal CDC, and suggests the potential of rechallenging with the same chemotherapy regimen, despite a short disease-free interval. The originality of this case was demonstrated by the delayed complete response more than one year after the end of GC-based second line chemotherapy. The patient remained disease-free at his last CT-scan evaluation in April 2018.",Dual inhibition of MEK and p38 impairs tumor growth in KRAS-mutated non-small cell lung cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867799,Oncology letters,2019 03 29,"Despite the high frequency of KRAS mutations in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), therapeutic modalities targeting KRAS-mutated NSCLC have not been established. Based on our previous findings that mutant KRAS knockdown sensitized NSCLC cells to a p38 inhibitor, the growth-inhibitory effect of dual MEK and p38 inhibition on tumor growth in NSCLC cells harboring KRAS mutations was investigated. In KRAS-mutated NSCLC cells, the MEK inhibitor, selumetinib, inhibited cell growth in a dose-dependent manner, and its growth-inhibitory effect was enhanced by combined treatment with the p38 inhibitor LY2228820. Similarly, another pair of MEK and p38 inhibitors also exhibited antitumor activity. Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) against MAPK14, which encodes p38α MAPK, enhanced the growth-inhibitory effect of the MEK inhibitors in NSCLC cells with KRAS mutations. Notably, MEK inhibitors reduced p38 expression levels but increased p38 phosphorylation levels, resulting in sensitization to p38 inhibitors in KRAS-mutated NSCLC cells. These results provide evidence that dual MEK and p38 inhibition could be a potent therapeutic strategy against oncogenic KRAS-driven NSCLC.",Molecular association of functioning stroma with carcinoma cells in the ovary: A preliminary study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867798,Oncology letters,2019 03 29,"The cancer stroma serves an important role in tumour behaviours, including invasion, metastasis, and response to chemotherapy. The stroma of ovarian carcinoma is sometimes specialized, with luteinisation and/or hyperthecosis, and is designated as the 'functioning stroma' because it exerts endocrine function and produces sex steroid hormones. In the present study, 14 ovarian cancers with functioning stroma, comprising 7 endometrioid carcinomas and 7 clear cell carcinomas, were analysed to evaluate the molecular association of the functioning stroma with carcinoma cells. The median age of the patients was 67 years (range, 52-85 years); 13 patients were postmenopausal, and one was in perimenopause. Serum oestrogen values ranged from 10 to 129 ng/ml, with a median of 51 ng/ml. Sequence abnormalities in AT-rich interaction domain 1A (ARID1A), phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit α (PIK3CA), Kirsten rat sarcoma viral proto-oncogene (KRAS) and phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) were examined in whole tumours. For cancers positive for sequence abnormalities, their localization in carcinoma cells and/or stromal cells was examined. A total of 8 mutations - ARID1A (L2155L), PIK3CA (H1047R), KRAS (Q12V, E31K, Q61L), and PTEN (C105fs*8) - were identified in the whole tumours of 5 patients. Seven of these eight mutations were detected only in carcinoma cells. However, one case of endometrioid carcinoma had a KRAS (E31K) mutation in both carcinoma and stromal cells. In conclusion, although functioning stromal cells of ovarian cancer are usually thought to be non-neoplastic, some may share an origin with carcinoma cells.",Regulation of radiosensitivity by 4-methylumbelliferone via the suppression of interleukin-1 in fibrosarcoma cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867797,Oncology letters,2019 03 29,"Tumor recurrence and distant metastasis following radiotherapy, which can lead to poor prognosis, are caused by residual cancer cells that acquire radioresistance. Chemotherapy or a combination of targeted inhibitors can potentially enhance radiation sensitivity and prevent metastasis. It was previously reported that co-administration of the hyaluronan synthesis inhibitor 4-methylumbelliferone (4-MU) enhanced the lethality of X-ray irradiation in HT1080 human fibrosarcoma cells and decreased their invasiveness to a greater extent than either treatment alone. To clarify the molecular basis of these effects, the present study conducted mRNA expression profiling by cDNA microarray to identify the signaling pathways that are altered under this combination treatment. The activation state of the signaling pathways was classified by z-scores in the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. The results revealed that the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8 were activated by 2 Gy X-ray irradiation, an effect that was abolished by co-administration of 4-MU. Similar trends were observed for the upstream signaling component IL-1. These results indicate that the radiosensitivity of fibrosarcoma cells is improved by suppressing inflammation through the administration of 4-MU.",Association of estradiol and HPV/HPV16 infection with the occurrence of cervical squamous cell carcinoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867796,Oncology letters,2019 03 29,"The associations between human papillomavirus (HPV) infection or hormonal exposure and cervical cancer risk are well established. However, to the best of our knowledge, the association between high endogenous estradiol levels in conjunction with HPV/HPV16 infection and the risk of cervical squamous cell carcinoma remains unknown. To investigate this, the current study conducted a matched case-control study in Shanxi Province, China, in which clinical samples were obtained from 74 females with newly diagnosed uterine cervix squamous cell carcinoma and 74 matched healthy females who were selected from 582 healthy females according to age, place of residence, marital status and menopausal status. From all participants, DNA was extracted from cells obtained from a cervical smear and serum was separated from venous blood withdrawn during days 5-8 of the menstrual cycle. HPV/HPV16 DNA and estradiol expression levels in the serum were measured by general polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, respectively. Significant differences were identified in the positive HPV and HPV16 DNA expression rates between patients and controls, with odds ratios (95% confidence interval) of 3.74 (1.84-7.59) and 4.04 (1.97-8.28), respectively. Expression levels of estradiol in patients were significantly higher compared with the controls (P<0.001), however, this was only identified when the HPV16 E2 or E6 oncogene status was negative. Considering 40 ng/ml as the cut-off estradiol level, 78.38% of patients exhibited high estradiol levels, which was significantly higher than the percentage of controls (P<0.001). An additive interaction pattern was revealed between estradiol expression levels and HPV/HPV16 infection. The results suggest that among the various types of HPV, HPV16 may be most likely to cause uterine cervix squamous cell carcinoma and an abnormally high level of endogenous estradiol may further increase this risk. Therefore, estradiol therapy may represent a new treatment strategy for cases of cervical cancer associated with HPV infection.","Therapeutic efficacy of intra-tumor AvidinOX and low systemic dose biotinylated cetuximab, with and without cisplatin, in an orthotopic model of head and neck cancer.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867794,Oncology letters,2019 03 29,"In a previous study, the efficacy of low intraperitoneal doses of biotinylated cetuximab (bCet) in mice with subcutaneous tumor xenografts of human head and neck cancer (HNC) treated intra-tumors with AvidinOX was reported. Taking into account that the current standard treatment for HNC is the combination of cetuximab and cisplatin, the present study investigated the activity of AvidinOX-targeted bCet with and without cisplatin in an orthotopic model. The results confirmed that administration of intra-tumor AvidinOX makes an otherwise inactive dose of bCet effective in reducing tumor growth, and the addition of a low dose of cisplatin further improved tumor growth inhibition. Supporting the in vivo data, immunohistochemical staining of tumor masses from mice treated with AvidinOX, bCet and cisplatin exhibited the highest tumor cell damage and the lowest angiogenic activity among all treatment groups, measured as the number of γ-H2A.X and cleaved caspase-3-positive cells, and vascular endothelial growth factor-C and platelet and endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1-positive cells, respectively. AvidinOX is currently under clinical investigation to assess its use in delivering radioactive biotin to inoperable tumor lesions (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02053324 and NCT03188328). The present study further supported the potential clinical use of AvidinOX to target low bCet doses to inoperable tumor lesions, with or without an additional low dose of cisplatin. Since low doses of highly expensive monoclonal antibodies become effective with AvidinOX and low dose cisplatin, such therapies promise to be cheaper and less toxic than current treatments.",Glypican-3 expression in malignant small round cell tumors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867793,Oncology letters,2019 03 29,"Malignant small round cell tumors usually progress rapidly and show resistance to chemotherapy, and it is often difficult to make a definitive diagnosis based on their histological morphology. Glypican-3 (GPC3) is a highly tumor-specific antigen, and the overexpression of GPC3 was reported in many pediatric and adult malignancies. In the present study, we investigated the GPC3 expression in pediatric malignant small round cell tumors to assess its role in the differential diagnosis of the tumors. Immunohistochemistry was performed to assess the expression of GPC3 in samples from 84 rhabdomyosarcomas (RMSs; 44 alveolar and 40 embryonal RMSs), 62 Ewing sarcomas (EWSs), 35 neuroblastomas (NBs) and two desmoplastic small round cell tumors (DSRCTs). We performed a reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction for GPC3 to determine the GPC3 mRNA expression in samples from 66 frozen tumors (23 RMSs, 28 EWSs and 15 NBs). The serum expression levels of GPC3 were analyzed in pre-operative blood samples from two RMS and eight NB patients. In total, 25% (21/84) of the RMSs and 3% (1/35) of the NBs exhibited a focal expression of GPC3, whereas, the other specimens showed no GPC3 expression. The GPC3 mRNA expression level of the RMSs with positive GPC3 expression (n=6) was significantly higher compared with the RMSs without such expression (n=17). A total of two cases of NB showed high serum levels of GPC3, but neither tumor showed immunoreactivity for GPC3. The immunohistochemical overexpression of GPC3 may be a candidate ancillary parameter in the differential diagnosis of RMS from EWS and DSRCT.",Knockdown of pseudogene DUXAP8 expression in glioma suppresses tumor cell proliferation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867791,Oncology letters,2019 03 29,"A large number of pseudogenes as well as long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been identified as important regulators in human tumors. However, the clinical role and potential functional effects of the double homeobox A pseudogene 8 (DUXAP8) in glioma remains unknown. In the present study, it was revealed that pseudogene DUXAP8 is significantly upregulated in glioma tissues, compared with adjacent normal tissues. Patients with increased DUXAP8 expression were associated with higher Karnofsky Performance Status, advanced World Health Organization grade, poor disease-free survival and overall survival rates of patients with glioma. Furthermore, in vitro assays, Cell-Counting Kit-8 cell viability and cell colony forming assays demonstrated that reduced DUXAP8 expression significantly suppressed proliferation capacity. Therefore, the results of the present study indicate that pseudogene DUXAP8 is an oncogenic lncRNA and may serve as a potentially prognostic biomarker and novel target of glioma treatment.",Hydroxyl safflower yellow A regulates the tumor immune microenvironment to produce an anticancer effect in a mouse model of hepatocellular carcinoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867790,Oncology letters,2019 03 29,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a serious threat to human health. Chemotherapy drugs such as cisplatin are widely used in cancer treatment, but can cause severe side effects. Hydroxyl safflower yellow A (HSYA) is a water-soluble chalcone glycoside substance extracted from safflowers (Carthamus tinctorius L.) that has been reported to inhibit tumor growth with few side effects. The tumor immune microenvironment is crucial for the proliferation and invasiveness of tumor cells, and it is mediated by forkhead box P3-positive (FOXP3+) regulatory T cells (Tregs) and retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor-γ (RORγ)-expressing Th17 cells. FOXP3+ Tregs inhibit immunoreaction and FOXP3 is a key indicator of Tregs. RORγ isoform 2, also known as RORγt, is an important transcription factor in Th17 cells that may promote cancer progression. In the present study, the antitumor effect of HSYA on HCC was investigated, as well as its impact on the tumor immune microenvironment. Following the establishment of a mouse model for HCC, hematoxylin and eosin staining were performed to observe histological changes in liver tumors, and the spleen and thymus were weighed to calculate the spleen and thymus indexes. The proportion of FOXP3+ Tregs in the spleen was determined by flow cytometry, and expression levels of Foxp3 and Rorγt were examined by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis. The results of the present study showed that cisplatin inhibited tumor growth, caused weight loss and reduced the immunoreactivity of the mice. HSYA inhibited tumor growth without causing significant weight loss. The proportion of FOXP3-expressing Tregs in the spleen and the expression of Foxp3 and Rorγt mRNA decreased following treatment with certain doses of HSYA. In conclusion, HSYA inhibited tumor growth without detrimental effects on the weight of the mice, indicating that HSYA may be suitable as a novel therapy for HCC patients.","MEG3 is associated with gsp oncogene regulation of growth hormone hypersecretion, proliferation and invasiveness of human GH-secreting adenomas.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867789,Oncology letters,2019 03 29,"Overactivation of the Gs-mediated pathway by mutations of the G-protein α subunit (Gsα), a gsp oncogene, results in increased growth hormone (GH) hypersecretion and reduced tumor volume in patients with GH-secreting pituitary tumors. However, the mechanism underlying the clinical characteristics of gsp oncogene requires further investigation. Cyclic adenosine monophosphate-responsive element binding (CREB), as a downstream target gene of gsp oncogene, is implicated in activating maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3). The present study proposes that gsp oncogene mediates MEG3-regulating GH hypersecretion, resulting in the small tumor size of GH-secreting tumors. Therefore, the present study detected Gsα mutations by polymerase chain reaction in GH-secreting tumors, and revealed that Gsα mutations were observed in 7/25 (28%) GH-secreting tumors. Gsp-positive tumors indicated significantly increased levels of phosphorylated p-CREB (P<0.0001) and MEG3 (P=0.039), compared with gsp-negative tumors. The results indicated that MEG3 levels were positively correlated with GH and IGF-1 levels, and negatively correlated with the tumor volume of GH-secreting tumors. The group with gsp-positive or with high MEG3 expression indicated a significantly reduced proportion of invasiveness and lower Ki-67 index, compared with the gsp-negative or low MEG3 expression group. In conclusion, gsp oncogene may mediate MEG3 by promoting GH hypersecretion, resulting in smaller tumors, as well as suppressing proliferation and invasiveness of GH-secreting pituitary tumors."

Retrospective method was used to analyze 58 cases of lung cancer patients treated by simple resection of lower lobe of left lung in the Second Hospital of Dalian Medical University from October 2016 to October 2017, and they were divided into two groups: Sevoflurane group (n=32) with sevoflurane anesthesia and propofol group (n=26) with propofol anesthesia. In the present study, the moment before induction of anesthesia (T1), before the start of one-lung ventilation (T2), before the end of one-lung ventilation (T3), after closed chest surgery (T4), 24 h after surgery (T5), calculate alveolar-arterial oxygen difference (A-aDO2), respiratory index (RI) and intrapulmonary shunt ratio (Qs/Qt), were compared between the two groups. The serum MMP-9 concentration at T1, T4 and T5 were detected by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. The cognitive function of two groups was assessed by Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) 1 day before surgery and 1 and 10 days after surgery. The A-aDO2 level at T4 in sevoflurane group was significantly higher than that in propofol group (P<0.05). The RI level at T3, T4, the Qs/Qt and the MMP-9 level at T4 in the sevoflurane group was significantly higher than that in the propofol group (P<0.05). The MMSE score in sevoflurane group was significantly lower than that in propofol group 1 and 10 days after surgery (P<0.05). Propofol has little effect on pulmonary function and can decrease inflammatory factor MMP-9. Both sevoflurane and propofol have an effect on cognitive function after lung cancer resection, but propofol can reduce cognitive impairment in patients with lung cancer.","Effects of dezocine and sufentanyl for postoperative analgesia on activity of NK, CD4+ and CD8+ cells in patients with breast cancer.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867775,Oncology letters,2019 03 29,"The effects of dezocine and sufentanyl on the activity of natural killer (NK), CD4+ and CD8+ cells in patients with breast cancer undergoing postoperative analgesia after radical mastectomy were compared.

A retrospective analysis of 70 cervical cancer patients treated in the The Third Affiliated Hospital of Kunming Medical University and Yunnan Cancer Hospital from October 2015 to December 2017 was performed, and the lesion tissues were used as the experimental group. Normal cervical tissues from another 67 healthy females confirmed by physical examination at the same period were selected as the control group. The FIGO staging criteria were used for staging of the cervical cancer patients, reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) method was used for the detection of the expression of miR-1202 and miR-195 in different tissues, and the receiver operating curve (ROC) was used for the analysis of the application values of miR-1202 and miR-195 diagnosis alone and their combined diagnosis in early cervical cancer patients. The levels of miR-1202 and miR-195 in the experimental group were lower than those in the control group (P<0.05). The differences were significant in the different stages of cervical cancer tissues (P<0.05). The later the staging of cervical cancer tissues were, the lower the levels of miR-1202 and miR-195 were. The sensitivities and area under the curve (AUC) values of miR-1202 and miR-195 in the combined diagnosis of early cervical cancer were significantly higher than those of miR-1202 and miR-195 alone. The expression levels of miR-1202 and miR-195 in the cervical cancer patients are different in different stages.

Plasma levels of PD-L1 before treatment and at 5, 10, and 15 days after treatment were measured by ELISA. Correlation between PD-L1 expression levels and treatment time was analyzed. Levels of PD-L1 in different pathological types were compared. ROC curve was used to analyze the efficacy of PD-L1 in the treatment of B-cell lymphoma. The expression level of PD-L1 in experimental group was 272.86±48.21 pg/ml, significantly higher than that in control group (18.24±3.62 pg/ml) (P<0.01). In patients with B-cell lymphoma, PD-L1 expression was highest in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, followed by small lymphocyte lymphoma, mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma, and the lowest PD-L1 expression level was observed in follicular lymphoma (P<0.05). Linear correlation analysis showed that the expression level of PD-L1 was negatively correlated with treatment time (r=-0.683, P<0.01). The highest Youden index (51.24) was set as cut-off score, the sensitivity of the diagnosis of B-cell lymphoma was 81.66%, and the specificity was 90.24%.

A frequent clinical challenge in patients with relapsing and/or metastatic disease is de novo or acquired trastuzumab resistance, and to date no predictive biomarkers for palliative trastuzumab have been established. In the present study, the prognostic values of factors involved in the HER2-associated PI3K/Akt signalling pathway were explored. The first 46 consecutive patients treated at the Department of Oncology, Linköping University Hospital between 2000 and 2007 with trastuzumab for HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer were retrospectively included. The gene copy number variation and protein expression of several components of the PI3K/Akt pathway were assessed in the tumour tissue and biopsy samples using droplet digital polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry. Patients with tumours displaying a high-grade ERBB2 (HER2) amplification level of ≥6 copies had a significantly improved overall survival hazard ratio [(HR)=0.4; 95%, confidence interval (CI): 0.2-0.9] and progression-free survival (HR=0.3; 95% CI: 0.1-0.7) compared with patients with tumours harbouring fewer ERBB2 copies. High-grade ERBB2 amplification was significantly associated with the development of central nervous system metastases during palliative treatment. Copy gain (≥3 copies) of the gene encoding the tyrosine phosphatase PTPN2 was associated with a shorter overall survival (HR=2.0; 95% CI: 1.0-4.0) and shorter progression-free survival (HR=2.1; 95% CI: 1.0-4.1). In conclusion, high ERBB2 amplification level is a potential positive prognostic factor in trastuzumab-treated HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer, whereas PTPN2 gain is a potential negative prognostic factor. Further studies are warranted on the role of PTPN2 in HER2 signalling.",Pain prevalence and treatment in patients with metastatic bone disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867771,Oncology letters,2019 03 29,"The accomplishment of successful pain treatment requires evaluation, characterization and quantification. The present study characterized pain and survival in a cohort of patients with cancer with bone metastasis who were treated with intravenous bisphosphonates. A total of 84 patients self-completed the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) and 36-Item Short Form Survey (SF-36), between November 2010 and March 2011 with a 5-year survival follow-up as a surrogate marker of cancer burden. The median age was 62 years old (34-85), 64% of patients were female and 58% of these females had breast cancer. In the population, self-reported pain was 91.6%, with 29 patients (34.5%) reporting severe pain (score 7-10). Among these patients, only 13 (44.8%) presented a similar report to that of their clinical files and 5 were undergoing treatment with strong opioids (17.2%). A total of 45 patients (46%) had not been prescribed analgesic drugs, of these patients, 32 were treated with a weak opioid, and 13 with a strong opioid. An association was observed between pain records and the prescribed analgesic (P=0.031). BPI maximum pain and overall survival data were analyzed, and a significant association was identified between male patients presenting severe pain and decreased survival (P=0.004). Male survival was associated with severe pain, which is consistent with other data. The results revealed a skeletal-related events (SRE)-free survival (time elapsed from diagnosis of the first bone metastasis to the first SRE) of 9 months (4.39-13.73, 95% CI) with a statistically significant difference between subgroups of time since diagnosis of bone metastasis (P=0.005). The added value of the present study is the suggestion that complete and accurate pain narratives are mandatory and may contribute to the optimization of analgesia, and may help to increase survival rates. Optimal pain management for patients with cancer remains an urgent requirement.",Serum miR-22 may be a biomarker for papillary thyroid cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867770,Oncology letters,2019 03 29,"The present study aimed to examine whether serum microRNA (miR)-22 may be considered a potential biomarker to differentiate patients with papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) from healthy controls. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction demonstrated that serum miR-22 expression was significantly enhanced in patients with PTC compared with in patients with benign thyroid nodules (BTN) and healthy controls. The expression levels of miR-22 were also increased in the thyroid tissue of patients with PTC compared with in patients with BTN. In addition, increased miR-22 in the serum of patients with PTC was positively associated with metastasis. Furthermore, miR-22 serum levels were increased in patients with PTC and the B-Raf proto-oncogene, serine/threonine kinase V600E mutation. Meanwhile, compared with patients with PTC and ≤1 ng/ml thyroglobulin (Tg)-fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB), serum miR-22 was significantly enhanced in patients with PTC and 1-10 ng/ml Tg-FNAB and >10 ng/ml Tg-FNAB. A receiver operating characteristic analysis demonstrated that serum miR-22 distinguished patients with PTC from patients with BTN and healthy controls. In conclusion, to the best of our knowledge, the present study was the first to demonstrate that upregulation of serum miR-22 may be used as a potential biomarker to distinguish patients with PTC from healthy controls.",Novel loss-of-function mutation in BRCA2 gene identified in a Chinese female with a family history of ovarian cancer: A case report.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867769,Oncology letters,2019 03 29,"Inherited loss-of-function mutations in the tumor suppressor BRCA2 gene are associated with a high risk of ovarian cancer in the Chinese population. The current case report discusses a novel heterozygous insertion in BRCA2 gene, c.3195_3196insA, in a 54-year-old Chinese female with hereditary ovarian cancer. This frameshift mutation generates a premature stop codon at amino acid 1,076, which leads to a truncated BRCA2 protein instead of a wild-type BRCA2 protein with 3,418 amino acids. According to the Breast Cancer Information Core database, this mutation has not been previously reported. However, germline mutations of BRCA2 are a more prevalent cause of ovarian cancer in Chinese females compared with females in Western populations.

Despite advances in cervical cancer therapy, tumor recurrence and metastasis remain the leading cause of mortality for patients with cervical cancer. Therefore, the investigation of tumorigenesis and progression, and the search for novel therapeutic targets, has been the primary focus in cervical cancer research. The aims of the present study were: i) To analyze the alterations in c-Met, E-cadherin and microRNA (miRNA)-1 expression levels in cervical cancer tissues; ii) to assess the correlation between the above genes and the pathological characteristics of the cancer tissues; and iii) to examine the potential mechanism through which miRNA-1 may regulate c-Met-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition to promote the development of cervical cancer. In cervical cancer tissues, c-Met was more highly expressed, while E-cadherin exhibited lower expression levels compared with the adjacent tissues. The 24-month follow-up reported that a lower c-Met expression level was correlated with higher E-cadherin expression levels and a longer survival rate. The miRNA-1 expression level in cancer tissues was 0.41±0.07 times lower compared with the adjacent tissues (P<0.01). A low miRNA expression level was correlated with a low survival rate of patients. In vitro, miRNA-1 inhibited the proliferation and migration of cervical cancer cell lines by downregulating c-Met mRNA. When miRNA-1 expression was downregulated in cervical cancer tissues, the inhibition of c-Met expression was reversed. The upregulation of c-Met expression levels was able to inhibit E-cadherin expression, which triggered the proliferation, migration and infiltration of cancer cells, and thus reduced patient survival rates.","Long non-coding RNA CRNDE regulates cell proliferation, migration, invasion, epithelial-mesenchymal transition and apoptosis in oral squamous cell carcinoma.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867767,Oncology letters,2019 03 29,"The present study aimed to investigate whether the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) colorectal neoplasia differentially expressed (CRNDE) can promote the migration and invasion of human oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cells via the regulation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT).

The expression of CRNDE in OSCC tissues and cell lines was detected by in situ hybridization (ISH) and reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. An MTT assay was used to detect cell proliferation, flow cytometry was performed to determine cell apoptosis, wound-healing and Transwell assays were conducted to evaluate cell metastasis, and immunofluorescence staining and western blotting were performed to measure the expression of proteins associated with EMT. Tumor-bearing mouse models were established, and the tumor volumes were recorded. An immunohistochemical assay was performed to determine the expression of EMT-related proteins. CRNDE expression was increased in OSCC tissues and cell lines compared with that in normal tissues and cell lines. Compared with the control group, the si-CRNDE group displayed a reduction in the expression of CRNDE, in the proliferation, migration and invasion of cells, in the protein expression of N-cadherin, vimentin and Snail, and in the expression of proteins in the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. However, an increase was displayed in the apoptosis of cells and the expression of E-cadherin. Compared with the control group of tumor-bearing nude mice, the sh-CRNDE group demonstrated slowed tumor growth, reduced tumor weight and elevated E-cadherin, as well as reduced expression of N-cadherin, vimentin and Snail. In conclusion, silencing CRNDE may inhibit EMT, thus decreasing the migration and invasion of human OSCC cells by repressing the activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, thereby restricting cell growth and promoting cell apoptosis."

Seventy-six patients with NSCLC admitted to Jimo Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine from July 2016 to March 2018 were enrolled in group A, while 60 healthy who received health examinations during the same period were enrolled in group B. The relative expression levels of serum miR-197 and miR-145 were detected by RT-qPCR. The relative expression of serum miR-197 in group A was significantly higher than that in group B (P<0.001); the relative expression of serum miR-145 in group A was significantly lower than that in group B (P<0.001); serum miR-197 in group A showed association with the clinical stage of NSCLC patients (P<0.001); serum miR-145 in group A was associated with the clinical stage and pathological differentiation of patients with NSCLC (P<0.001). The AUC of serum miR-197 diagnosis of NSCLC was 0.864 (95% CI: 0.804-0.924), with a diagnostic sensitivity of 73.68% and a specificity of 85.00%; the AUC of serum miR-145 diagnosis of NSCLC was 0.879 (95% CI: 0.824-0.934), with a diagnostic sensitivity of 84.21% and a specificity of 71.67%; the AUC of the diagnosis of the combination of serum miR-197 and miR-145 for NSCLC was 0.952 (95% CI: 0.919-0.984), with a diagnostic sensitivity of 92.10% and a specificity of 78.33%. miR-197 and miR-145 are potential new biomarkers in the diagnosis of NSCLC due to their possible involvement in the occurrence and development of NSCLC. With good sensitivity and specificity of single miR-197 and single miR-145 for the diagnosis of NSCLC, the combined detection of miR-197 and miR-145 can achieve a better sensitivity in the diagnosis of NSCLC.",miR-7-5p regulates the proliferation and migration of colorectal cancer cells by negatively regulating the expression of Krüppel-like factor 4.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867755,Oncology letters,2019 03 29,"Previous studies have demonstrated that microRNA-7-5p (miR-7-5p) functions as a tumor suppressor in certain types of human cancer. However, the role of miR-7-5p in colorectal cancer (CRC) remains to be investigated. Using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), the present study demonstrated that miR-7-5p was downregulated in CRC tissues and cell lines. In addition, low miR-7-5p expression is able to predict a poor 5-year overall survival rate for patients with CRC. In vitro studies revealed that miR-7-5p overexpression inhibits cell proliferation and migration. Furthermore, Krüppel-like factor 4 (KLF4), an oncogene in CRC, was validated as a direct target of miR-7-5p. KLF4 expression was negatively correlated with miR-7-5p expression in CRC tissues. Notably, KLF4 overexpression rescued the suppressive effects of miR-7-5p on CRC cell proliferation and migration. In summary, the results of this study demonstrated that miR-7-5p inhibits CRC proliferation and migration by targeting KLF4, which suggests that miR-7-5p is a potential molecular target for the treatment of human CRC.",Prognostic value of KRAS/TP53/PIK3CA in non-small cell lung cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867754,Oncology letters,2019 03 29,"The present study explored the association between KRAS proto-oncogene GTPase (KRAS), phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit α (PIK3CA) and tumor protein p53 (TP53) mutations, and the clinical features and survival prognosis in 50 patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The most common concurrent single gene mutation was TP53, followed by KRAS and PIK3CA. Co-existing mutations were found in 17 patients. KRAS, PIK3CA and TP53 mutations were associated with carbohydrate antigen 19-9 expression, invasive growth, vacuolar signs and margin lobulation on chest CT. The incidence of distant metastasis (bone and adrenal) with KRAS and TP53 mutations was greater than that of local metastasis (pleura). Patients with the wild-type genes experienced longer progression-free survival (PFS) times than those with KRAS, TP53, KRAS/TP53 or PIK3CA/TP53 mutations. Patients with KRAS/TP53 or PIK3CA/TP53 mutations experienced shorter PFS times than those with a single KRAS or TP53 mutation. KRAS, PIK3CA and TP53 mutations were associated with distant metastases and a poor prognosis. Patients with NSCLC should receive routine KRAS, PIK3CA and TP53 gene sequencing to determine mutations for the analysis of clinical characteristics and prognosis.","Diagnostic value of apolipoprotein C-I, transthyretin and apolipoprotein C-III in gastric cancer.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867753,Oncology letters,2019 03 29,"Diagnostic value of apolipoprotein C-I (ApoC-I), transthyretin (TTR) and ApoC-III in gastric cancer were evaluated. Retrospective analysis methods were used to collect 60 patients with gastric cancer first diagnosed in The First Affiliated Hospital of Jiaxing University. There were 60 patients with chronic atrophic gastritis in the benign lesion group and 60 healthy individuals in the control group. The expression levels of serum ApoC-I, TTR and ApoC-III was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Differences existed in the expression levels of ApoC-I, TTR and ApoC-III in the gastric cancer group, benign lesion group and control group (P<0.001), with the expression levels of ApoC-I, TTR and ApoC-III in the gastric cancer group being lower than that of the benign lesion group (P<0.05), and the expression levels of ApoC-I, TTR and ApoC-III in the benign lesion group being lower than that of the control group (P<0.05). The expression levels of ApoC-I, TTR and ApoC-III in the gastric cancer group were to a certain degree correlated with the clinical stage, lymph node metastasis and differentiation of patients in the gastric cancer group (P<0.05). The specificity and negative predictive value of combined detection were proven to be higher than the separate detection of the three factors (P<0.05). The detection of serum ApoC-I, TTR and ApoC-III was of great significance in the diagnosis of gastric cancer and the estimation of its severity. The method of combined detection is worth a further in-depth study as it could improve the specificity of diagnosis and have a higher negative predictive value.",miR-127 suppresses gastric cancer cell migration and invasion via targeting Wnt7a.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867752,Oncology letters,2019 03 29,"Gastric cancer (GC) is a malignant tumor originating from the mucosal epithelium of the stomach. Patients suffering from this disease may have occurrence of residual GC due to delay in diagnosis and treatment. In addition, abnormal expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) is involved in GC progression. Therefore, we examined the underlying mechanism of miR-127 in GC. The expression of miR-127 and Wnt7a was examined in GC using RT-qPCR and western blot analysis. A Transwell assay was used to assess the ability of GC cell migration and invasion. Luciferase reporter assay was used to verify the specific target of miR-127 in GC. The results showed miR-127 expression was lower in GC than normal samples, while Wnt7a expression was detected at a higher level in GC than normal samples. The association between miR-127 and Wnt7a expression was negatively correlated in GC tissues. miR-127 mimic in the two GC cell lines markedly curbed cell migration and invasion, while inhibition of miR-127 showed the opposite effect. In addition, Wnt7a siRNA significantly inhibited GC cell migration and invasion and Wnt7a was verified as a specific target of miR-127 in GC cells. Wnt7a reversed the ability of GC cell migration and invasion regulated by miR-127. In conclusion, miR-127 could curb GC cell migration and invasion by upregulating Wnt7a, indicating its potential application in GC diagnosis and therapy.",MicroRNA-218 inhibits the cell proliferation and migration in clear cell renal cell carcinoma through targeting cancerous inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2A.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867751,Oncology letters,2019 03 29,"MicroRNAs (miRs) have emerged as critical modulators of tumor initiation and progression in numerous types of human cancer, including clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), which is the most common subtype of renal cell carcinoma. Cancerous inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2A (CIP2A) is a newly characterized oncoprotein and its overexpression has been reported to promote cellular epithelial-mesenchymal transition and the tumor progression of ccRCC. The present study examined the effects of miR-218 on CIP2A expression in ccRCC cells. The results demonstrated that the expression level of miR-218 was lower in ccRCC tissues compared with that in adjacent non-tumor renal tissues. In addition, it was identified that miR-128 could directly bind to the 3'-untranslated region of CIP2A. Furthermore, a negative correlation between the expression levels of miR-218 and CIP2A was detected in ccRCC. Additionally, the downregulation of CIP2A or overexpression of miR-218 in ccRCC cells was revealed to inhibit cell proliferation and migration. In summary, these data suggest that miR-218 serves a role in the regulation of CIP2A and elucidate its consequences on tumor progression, tumor cell proliferation and migration. These results indicate that miR-218 may exhibit potential as a molecular target for the treatment of ccRCC.",Effect of brown adipose tissue/cells on the growth of mouse hepatocellular carcinoma in vitro and in vivo.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867750,Oncology letters,2019 03 29,"Activation of brown adipose tissue (BAT) is an effective strategy for treating obesity. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a life-threatening hepatic malignancy with a high mortality rate. Considering that obesity is a risk factor for HCC, the aim of the present study was to investigate the association between HCC and BAT. Using a mouse model, H22 transplantation led to an increase in liver weight, a decrease in the weight of BAT and white adipose tissue, and an increase in the serum level of triacylglycerol (TG). In the in vivo BAT excision model, the removal of BAT led to increased growth of H22 tumors, which was accompanied by a more marked increase in liver weight and in the serum level of TG. The in vitro and in vivo intervention models with primary brown adipose cells (BACs) indicated that primary BACs can directly decrease the viability of H22 cells and the growth of tumors. In conclusion, BAT is a protective organ or tissue against HCC, and BACs may be a potential therapeutic tool for the treatment of HCC.","Differentially expressed genes ASPN, COL1A1, FN1, VCAN and MUC5AC are potential prognostic biomarkers for gastric cancer.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867749,Oncology letters,2019 03 29,"Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the most common malignancies worldwide. To the best of our knowledge, no biomarkers have been widely accepted for the early diagnosis and prognostic prediction of GC. This study aimed to identify potential novel prognostic biomarkers for GC. The dataset GSE29272, which originates from the public database Gene Expression Omnibus, was employed in the present study. The online tool GEO2R was used to calculate the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in GSE29272 between tumour tissues and adjacent tissues. CytoHubba and MCODE plugins of Cytoscape software were used to obtain hub genes and modules of DEGs. The online tools Database for Annotation, Visualisation and Integrated Discovery and Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes were employed to conduct Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis, and to construct protein-protein interaction networks. A total of 117 DEGs were extracted from GSE29272. In addition, 15 hub genes and seven modules were identified in the 117 DEGs. The enrichment analysis revealed that they were mainly enriched in GO biological process and cellular component domains, and the 'ECM-receptor interaction', 'focal adhesion', 'metabolism of xenobiotics by cytochrome P450' and 'drug metabolism' pathways. The hub genes asporin (ASPN), collagen type I α1 chain (COL1A1), fibronectin 1 (FN1), versican (VCAN) and mucin 5AC (MUC5AC) were demonstrated to have prognostic value for patients with GC. The ASPN and VCAN genes were significantly associated with overall survival and disease-free survival (log-rank P=0.025, 0.038, 0.0014 and 0.015, respectively). COL1A1 and FN1 were significantly associated with overall survival (log-rank P=0.013 and 0.05, respectively), and MUC5AC was significantly associated with disease-free survival (log-rank P=0.027). Results from the present study suggested that ASPN, COL1A1, FN1, VCAN and MUC5AC may represent novel prognostic biomarkers for GC.",Differential effects of ginkgol C17:1 on cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity: Protecting human normal L02 hepatocytes versus sensitizing human hepatoma HepG2 cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867748,Oncology letters,2019 03 29,"Liver cancer is a major healthcare problem and one of the leading causes of cancer-associated mortality in the world. To date, chemotherapy remains a common method for treating cancer and cisplatin is one of the most widely used chemotherapeutics. However, owing to drug resistance and side effects, it is imperative to identify a novel approach to improve the anticancer effect of cisplatin. Auxiliary chemotherapy drugs with minor toxicity to normal cells may represent a novel strategy for cancer therapy. Previous studies have indicated that ginkgol C17:1 exhibits anticancer effects in liver cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. The antitumor activity of ginkgol C17:1 has been reported in combination with cisplatin in human liver cancer cells. Owing to the route of systemic administration, liver cancer cells and normal hepatocytes were exposed to chemotherapeutics and auxiliary chemotherapy drugs. However, the effects of ginkgol C17:1 in normal hepatocytes remain unclear. In the present study, the biological effects of ginkgol C17:1 alone and as co-treatment with cisplatin were compared in human hepatoma cells and normal hepatocytes. Consistently, the results confirmed that in human hepatoma HepG2 cells, ginkgol C17:1 or cisplatin alone induced autophagy and apoptosis. The co-treatment increased cisplatin-induced apoptosis and inhibited cisplatin-induced autophagy. In comparison, the treatments in human normal L02 hepatocytes indicated that ginkgol C17:1 alone induced autophagy, whereas cisplatin alone induced apoptosis. The co-treatment inhibited cisplatin-induced apoptosis, but enhanced autophagy in L02 cells. Further investigation revealed that the AMP-activated protein kinase/serine/threonine protein kinase ULK1 and phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B/mammalian target of rapamycin signaling pathways were involved in the underlying regulatory mechanisms. Taken together, the results of the present study provide the first evidence that ginkgol C17:1 protects normal hepatocytes against cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity while potentiating the anticancer effect of cisplatin chemotherapy. The differential effects on normal and cancer cells suggest that ginkgol C17:1 is a promising candidate for auxiliary chemotherapy.",Silencing of the long non-coding RNA GHET1 inhibits cell proliferation and migration of renal cell carcinoma through epithelial-mesenchymal transition.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867747,Oncology letters,2019 03 29,"Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been demonstrated to serve vital roles in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) development. Gastric carcinoma high expressed transcript 1 (GHET1) regulates numerous biological processes in cancer cells. However, the biological role of GHET1 in RCC has not yet been identified. This study aimed to investigate the role of GHET1 in RCC. In the present study, the expression of GHET1 in RCC tissues and the 786-O, A498 and 293 cell lines was assessed by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Cell Counting Kit-8, colony formation and cell scratch assays were used to determine the effects of GHET1 on tumorigenesis. Western blotting was performed to examine the effect of GHET1 on epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in RCC cells. GHET1 expression was significantly increased in the RCC samples in comparison with adjacent tissues. High expression levels of GHET1 were associated with distant metastasis and clinical stage severity, thus, high GHET1 expression may serve as a predictor for a poor prognosis. In addition, RCC cells presented higher GHET1 mRNA and protein expression levels compared with in 293 cells. Furthermore, silencing GHET1 suppressed cell growth, weakened cell migration and inhibited EMT of RCC cells in vitro. In conclusion, the present study suggested that GHET1 may be considered a therapeutic target for the treatment or prevention of RCC."

The presence of the 4q12 amplicon causes the activation of downstream mast/stem cell growth factor receptor Kit (c-Kit) or platelet-derived growth factor receptor α (PDGFRA) signaling pathways. Therefore, in the present study, the association between the functional proteins phosphorylated c-Kit (p-c-Kit) and phosphorylated PDGFRA (p-PDGFRA) and the prognosis of ALK fusion NSCLC was investigated. Advanced stage NSCLC samples with ALK fusion were tested for their p-c-Kit and p-PDGFRA content by immunohistochemical staining, and for its association with crizotinib efficacy and the survival of the patients. Of 64 eligible ALK-positive patients with NSCLC, 30 (46.9%) were p-c-Kit-positive and 10 (15.7%) were p-PDGFRA-positive. Brain metastases were more common in ALK-positive cases that were p-PDGFRA-positive compared with those who were p-PDGFRA-negative. ALK-positive patients treated with crizotinib, who exhibited high levels of p-c-Kit had significantly lower progression-free survival times than those with low levels. In addition, the patients with high levels of p-c-Kit exhibited lower overall survival times than those with low levels. Furthermore, multivariate analysis indicated that high levels of p-c-Kit in patients with ALK fusion was the only significant predictive factor for crizotinib efficacy and was a prognostic factor for poor overall survival time. However, no statistically significant difference was observed in the survival of patients with different p-PDGFRA levels. p-PDGFRA was more frequently expressed in the ALK-positive cases with brain metastasis. c-Kit signaling activation may be associated with poor efficacy of crizotinib and poor prognosis in advanced ALK fusion NSCLC.",MicroRNA-21 and its impact on signaling pathways in cervical cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867735,Oncology letters,2019 03 29,"Oncogenic microRNA-21 (miR-21/miRNA-21) is a stable inhibitor of gene expression that is often upregulated in cervical cancer, a disease that affects the health of women and tends to transform and spread. Previous studies investigating miR-21 in biopsies and cells from cervical cancer patients have identified that miR-21 binds target mRNAs in signaling pathways or long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA). Furthermore, studies have elucidated the molecular mechanisms of two tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) signaling pathways that promote cell proliferation and inhibit cell apoptosis. miR-21 inhibits the TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1) signaling pathway and activates the TNFR2 signaling pathway. Moreover, miR-21 enhances cervical cancer cell proliferation by influencing the protein kinase B/mammalian target of rapamycin and RAS p21 protein activator 1 signaling pathways. The present review discusses the evidence that miR-21 may impact cervical cancer through inhibiting apoptosis and enhancing proliferation, and may therefore be a target for clinical intervention.",Cancer-associated fibroblast regulation of tumor neo-angiogenesis as a therapeutic target in cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867734,Oncology letters,2019 03 29,"Adequate blood supply is essential for tumor survival, growth and metastasis. The tumor microenvironment (TME) is dynamic and complex, comprising cancer cells, cancer-associated stromal cells and their extracellular products. The TME serves an important role in tumor progression. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are the principal component of stromal cells within the TME, and contribute to tumor neo-angiogenesis by altering the proteome and degradome. The present paper reviews previous studies of the molecular signaling pathways by which CAFs promote tumor neo-angiogenesis and highlights therapeutic response targets.

The carriers of pathogenic mutations in these genes have an increased risk of developing a colorectal cancer and/or LS-associated cancer. The LS-associated cancer types include carcinomas of the endometrium, small intestine, stomach, pancreas and biliary tract, ovary, brain, upper urinary tract and skin. The criteria for the clinical diagnosis of LS and the procedures of the genetic testing for identification of pathogenetic mutations carriers in MMR genes have long been known. A crucial point in the mutation detection analysis is the correct definition of the pathogenecity associated with MMR genetic variants, especially in order to include the mutation carriers in the endoscopy surveillance programs more suited to them. Therefore, this may help to improve the LS-associated cancer prevention programs. In the present review, we also report the recent discoveries in molecular genetics of LS, such as the new roles of MMR protein and immune response of MMR repair deficiency in colorectal cancer. Finally, we discuss the main therapeutic approaches, including immunotherapy, which represent a valid alternative to traditional therapeutic methods and extend the life expectancy of patients that have already developed LS-associated colorectal cancer.",Primary cilia and their role in cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867732,Oncology letters,2019 03 29,"Primary cilia are microtubule-based organelles that are expressed on almost all mammalian cells. It has become apparent that these structures are important signaling hubs that serve crucial roles in Wnt, hedgehog, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and Notch signaling pathways. A number of diseases have been found to involve dysfunctional primary cilia; collectively these diseases are called ciliopathies. In recent years, there has been more focus on the association between primary cilia and cancer, including renal, pancreatic and breast cancer. Numerous studies have demonstrated that various types of cancer cells fail to express cilia. Notably, it has also been indicated that a number of renal carcinogens induce a significant loss of cilia in renal epithelial cells. The present review focuses on the existing literature regarding primary cilia and their involvement with cancer signaling pathways, providing a brief overview of the structural features and functions of primary cilia, then discussing the evidence associating primary cilia with cancer, and presenting the available information on the ERK/MAPK, hedgehog and Wnt signaling pathways, and their involvement in primary cilia in association with cancer.",NDNF inhibits the migration and invasion of human renal cancer cells through epithelial-mesenchymal transition.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867731,Oncology letters,2019 03 29,"Neuron-derived neurotrophic factor (NDNF) is a glycosylated, disulfide-bonded secretory protein that contains a fibronectin type III domain. NDNF has been identified as a neurotrophic factor; however, its role in carcinogenesis has not yet been identified. To investigate the expression and role of NDNF in carcinogenesis, the expression of NDNF in human Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) cell lines and tissues was detected by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and western blot analysis. Cell proliferation was investigated using CCK-8 and colony formation assays, and the cell invasion and immigration capacity was evaluated using the transwell assay. The results demonstrated that NDNF expression was downregulated in RCC cell lines and RCC tissues. Restoring NDNF expression significantly inhibited the proliferation, migration and invasion of RCC cells. The study also demonstrated that the inhibitory effect of NDNF on invasive ability was mediated by suppressing the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in RCC cells. NDNF may therefore be considered an important regulator of EMT in RCC progression and may represent a novel promising target for antimetastatic therapy.",Effect of dexmedetomidine anesthesia on respiratory function in pediatric patients undergoing retinoblastoma resection.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867730,Oncology letters,2019 03 29,"The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of dexmedetomidine (Dex) on the respiratory function during anesthesia induction in pediatric patients undergoing retinoblastoma (RB) resection.

General anesthesia was first induced for all patients, of which 45 were randomly assigned to the experimental group and received Dex through an intravenous infusion pump to maintain general anesthesia. The remaining 42 patients were assigned to the control group and received saline through an intravenous infusion pump.

Incidence of perioperative cardiac and respiratory adverse events was counted in both groups, and post-anesthesia resuscitation was evaluated and compared. Compared with T0, the respiratory rate (R) of the experimental group was lower at T1-T4, but there was no statistical difference (P<0.05). Compared with T0, the control group had a higher R at T2, lower R at T3 and T4 (P<0.05), and there was no significant difference in R between T0 and T1 (P>0.05).

Compared with the experimental group at the same time-point, SpO2 of the control group at T1-T4 decreased significantly (P<0.05). The heart rate (HR) of the experimental and control groups was lower at T1-T4 than that at T0 (P<0.05). The HR of the experimental group was higher than that of the control group at T1-T4 (P<0.05). Mean arterial pressure (MAP) of the experimental and control groups was lower at T1-T4 than that at T0 (P<0.05). MAP of the control group was higher than that of the experimental group at T2 but lower than that at T0 of the control group. MAP of the control group was lower than that of the experimental group at T1-T4. There was no significant difference in incidence of tachycardia, bradycardia, vomiting, hypoxia and laryngism between the two groups (P>0.05). There was no difference in resuscitation and extubation time between the two groups (P>0.05). Finally, agitation of the control group was more severe than that of the experimental group (P<0.05). Therefore, Dex can improve the respiratory function and hemodynamic stability during anesthesia induction in children with RB resection.",Association between digital breast tomosynthesis and molecular subtypes of breast cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867729,Oncology letters,2019 03 29,"In recent years, with increasing prevalence, particularly in young patients, breast cancer is considered to be one of the most common malignancies. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the clinical value of digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) in diagnosing molecular subtypes of breast cancer. The present study retrospectively analyzed 134 cases of breast cancer with data regarding surgery, complete pathology and immunohistochemistry, which were collected at The Second Clinical College of Fujian Medical University (Quanzhou, China) between May 2013 and October 2014. The patients were divided into the four following molecular subtypes: Luminal A, luminal B, triple-negative and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2) overexpression, according to the expression of estrogen receptor, progesterone hormone receptor, HER-2 and Ki67. The association between clinical characteristics of each molecular subtype and characteristics of DBT were assessed. Calcification scores and lymph node size were the indicators that exhibited a significant difference following comparison between the four molecular subtypes. The subgroup analysis based on tumor size, calcification scores and lymph node size identified a significant difference in the distribution between patients with breast cancer with lymph node size of ≥1.5 and <1.5 cm. The analysis also revealed that the molecular subtypes of breast cancer were significantly associated with variables of calcification scores and lymph node size. In conclusion, the diagnostic imaging features, including calcification score and lymph node size, determined using DBT could be used as assistant diagnostic markers of breast cancer molecular subtypes.",Prognostic significance of tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes for oestrogen receptor-negative breast cancer without lymph node metastasis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867728,Oncology letters,2019 03 29,"Tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) are regarded as significant prognostic markers in patients with breast cancer. However, the prognostic utility of TIL expression based on the intrinsic subtypes has just been identified. The present study investigated the relationship between TIL grades and prognosis in 294 Japanese paitents with breast cancer stratified based on the intrinsic subtypes and clinicopathological characteristics. Stromal TIL status was evaluated using haematoxylin and eosin staining, and TIL grades were categorised into low (<10%), intermediate (≥10 and ≤40%) and high (>40%) groups. The relationship between TIL expression and the intrinsic subtypes, clinicopathological characteristics and patient prognosis was analyzed. It was revealed that high TIL expression was correlated with negative oestrogen receptor (ER) expression and high histological grade (P<0.001). Among the ER-negative patients, the relapse-free survival (RFS) rate of the high-grade TIL group was significantly higher than that of the low-grade TIL group (P=0.04). Among the ER-negative patients without lymph node metastasis, RFS and cancer-specific survival (CSS) rates of patients with high-grade TILs were significantly higher than the RFS and CSS rates of patients with low-grade TILs (P=0.01). However, among ER-positive patients, RFS was significantly higher in the low-grade TIL group than in the high-grade TIL group (P=0.02). In conclusion, TIL expression correlated with ER status and tumour proliferation. High TIL expression was a poor prognostic marker in ER-positive patients but was a good prognostic marker in ER-negative patients. Therefore, the biological association between TILs and primary breast tumours may differ between ER-positive and ER-negative breast cancer.",Classification of breast mass lesions on dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging by a computer-assisted diagnosis system based on quantitative analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867727,Oncology letters,2019 03 29,"The aim of the current study was to develop a semi-automatic and quantitative method for the analysis of a time-intensity curve (TIC) from breast dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging. The performance of the proposed method, based on the level set segmentation algorithm, was evaluated by comparison with the traditional method. In the traditional method, the lesion area is delineated manually and the corresponding mean TIC is classified subjectively as one of three washout patterns. In addition, only one quantitative parameter, the maximum slope of increase (MSI), is calculated. In the proposed method, the lesion region was determined semi-automatically and the corresponding mean TIC was categorized quantitatively. In addition to MSI, a number of quantitative parameters were derived from the mean TIC and lesion area, including signal intensity slope (SIslope), initial percentage of enhancement (Einitial), percentage of peak enhancement (Epeak), early signal enhancement ratio (ESER) and second enhancement percentage (SEP). Wilcoxon signed-rank test and receiver operating characteristic analyses were performed for statistical analysis. For TIC categorization the accuracy was 61.54% for the traditional method and 82.05% for the proposed method. Using the proposed method, mean curve accuracies were 84.0% for SIslope, 66.7% for MSI, 66.0% for Einitial, 66.0% for Epeak, 68.0% for ESER and 44.9% for SEP. In the lesion region, the accuracies for the aforementioned parameters were 80.8, 65.4, 66.7, 62.2, 69.2 and 57.1%, respectively. Accuracy of the MSI value derived from the traditional method was 63.4%. Compared with the traditional method, the proposed semi-automatic method in the current study may provide results with a higher accuracy to differentiate benign and malignant lesions. Therefore, the proposed method should be considered as a supplementary tool for the diagnosis of breast lesions."

C57BL/6 mice were subjected to TAC or sham operation and then were orally gavaged with acetazolamide (20 mg/kg/day). After 4 weeks of operation, cardiac function was detected by echocardiography. Interstitial fibrosis was stained with Masson's trichrome. The expression of α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), collagen I, transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) and Smad2 were measured by western blotting. The TAC mice displayed significant cardiac dysfunction and fibrosis. The expression of α-SMA, collagen I, TGF-β1 and p-Smad2 in the TAC group was higher than those in the sham group. By contrast, acetazolamide administration inhibited interstitial fibrosis, as well as improved cardiac dysfunction induced by TAC. Acetazolamide also reduced the expression of α-SMA, collagen I, TGF-β1 and p-Smad2 in the TAC mice. Acetazolamide was able to attenuate cardiac fibrosis and improve cardiac dysfunction. The molecular mechanism involved in the anti-fibrotic effect of acetazolamide possibly was through inhibiting TGF-β1/Smad2 signaling pathway.",Microvesicles containing miR-34a induce apoptosis of proximal tubular epithelial cells and participate in renal interstitial fibrosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867715,Experimental and therapeutic medicine,2019 03 29,"Function and potential mechanism of microvesicles (MVs) containing microRNA34a in renal interstitial fibrosis were investigated. A rat model of renal interstitial fibrosis was established by unilateral ureteral ligation (UUO). Rat proximal tubular epithelial cell line (NRK-52E) was used to explore the effect of MVs containing microRNA-34a on tubular epithelial cells during fibrosis, which were secreted by tubulointerstitial fibroblasts. Regardless of the UUO renal interstitial fibrosis model, or the TGF-β1-treated renal tubular epithelial cells, microRNA-34a was increased in the MVs secreted by tubulointerstitial fibroblasts. miR-34a could be transmitted through the damaged tubule basement membrane to proximal tubular epithelial cells, where it induced apoptosis of renal tubular epithelial cells by inhibiting the expression of Bcl-2, further aggravating renal interstitial fibrosis. MicroRNA-34a secreted by damaged renal interstitial fibroblasts can promote renal tubular epithelial cell apoptosis and participate in renal interstitial fibrosis by inhibiting Bcl-2.",Crosstalk analysis of dysregulated pathways in preeclampsia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867714,Experimental and therapeutic medicine,2019 03 29,"A crosstalk between multiple biological pathways has been proposed in biological processes. However, the existence and degree of this phenomenon in patients with preeclampsia (PE) have not been strictly investigated. Thus, this study explored an dysregulated pathway set (DPS) for PE based on pathway crosstalk network (PCN) related analysis. In the present study, four steps were performed in the inference of DPS: acquiring data of gene expression, pathway and protein-protein interaction (PPI) construction; building a PCN through integrating the information in these datasets and Pearson's correlation coefficient (PCC). A principal component analysis (PCA) approach was used to compute the activity of every pathway for selecting seed pathway of PCN. DPS was evaluated by measuring of an area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) and seed pathway from PCN. Consequently, a total of 420 pathways and 6,032 crosstalks were mapped to the PCN, in which RIG-I/MDA5-mediated induction of IFN-α/β pathways was identified as the seed pathway that had the greatest changes in activity scores across PE patients and normal controls. DPS was composed of 15 dysregulated pathways and 46 crosstalks, in which CLEC7A (Dectin-1) signaling possessed the highest degree of 12, which indicated it exerted an important role in the DPS. Our results revealed crosstalk between pathways and the DPS crucial for PE pathogenesis, which aid in excavating potential biomarkers of PE therapy and unveil the underlying pathological mechanism of this disease.",Effect of HIFU on endometrial receptivity and sex hormone level in uterine fibroid patients and analysis of influencing factors for its treatment rate.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867713,Experimental and therapeutic medicine,2019 03 29,"Effect of high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) uterine fibroid ablation on the endometrial receptivity and sex hormone level in uterine fibroid patients and the influencing factors for treatment rate were investigated. A retrospective analysis of 266 uterine fibroid patients admitted to the Department of Gynaecology in the Jining Maternity and Child Care Hospital from October 2013 to October 2016 was performed. Among them, observation group was treated with HIFU ablation (n=143), control group with myomectomy (n=123). The pulsatility index (PI) and the resistance index (RI) of the uterine arterial blood flow were measured during the luteal phase of menstruation by transvaginal ultrasonography. The serum luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and estradiol (E2) were detected by chemical immunofluorescence. The relationship between HIFU treatment rate and clinical pathology of uterine fibroid patients was analyzed, and univariate/multivariate regression analysis was used to analyze the influencing factors for HIFU treatment rate. There was no significant difference in preoperative and postoperative PI and RI between the two groups (P>0.05); no significant difference between preoperative and postoperative PI/RI in the same group (P>0.05). There was no significant difference in preoperative and postoperative LH, FSH and E2 between the two groups (P>0.05); no significant difference between preoperative LH and postoperative LH in the same group (P>0.05), neither FSH or E2 (P>0.05). Results of multivariate analysis showed that fibroid location and ultrasound contrast intensity were independent influencing factors for HIFU treatment rate (P<0.05). Treatment of uterine fibroid with HIFU has no effect on the patient's endometrial receptivity and sex hormone level. Fibroid location and ultrasound contrast intensity are independent risk factors for HIFU treatment rate. This study provides guidance for the clinical optimization of treatment methods and is more conducive to the promotion of HIFU ablation therapy.",MicroRNA-205-5p regulates extracellular matrix production in hyperplastic scars by targeting Smad2.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867712,Experimental and therapeutic medicine,2019 03 29,"Hypertrophic scar (HS) formation is the result of poor skin-wound healing. At present, the pathogenesis of HS formation is largely unclear. Micro (miR)RNAs have important effects on a variety of biological and pathological processes. The role of miRNA in HS formation remains largely unclear. The present study aimed to investigate the role of miR-205-5p in HS, and explore the underlying molecular mechanism. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was used to determine the expression of miR-205-5p in HS. Western blot assay and RT-qPCR were performed to assess the expression of associated proteins and genes, respectively. TargetScan was performed to predict the target gene of miR-205-5p, and the luciferase reporter assay was applied to verify the prediction. The function of miR-205-5p on cell proliferation was detected using Cell Counting Kit-8 assay, and cell apoptosis was detected via flow cytometry. miR-205-5p expression was decreased in HS tissues and human hypertrophic scar fibroblasts (hHSFs). Mothers against decapentaplegic homolog (Smad)2 was significantly increased in HS tissues and HSFs, and it was directly targeted by miR-205-5p. Restoration of miR-205-5p suppressed HSF cell proliferation and induced cell apoptosis. It was also demonstrated that RAC-Alpha Serine/Threonine-Protein Kinase (AKT) phosphorylation and the expression of α-smooth muscle actin, collagen I and collagen III were inhibited by miR-205-5p. In addition, Smad2 weakened the effects of miR-205-5p on HSFs. In conclusion, miR-205-5p exhibited an important role in HS by targeting smad2 and suppressing the AKT pathway. These findings provide a clearer understanding of the mechanism for HS that may be used to develop novel treatments for HS.","Differential composition of gut microbiota among healthy volunteers, morbidly obese patients and post-bariatric surgery patients.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867711,Experimental and therapeutic medicine,2019 03 29,"The modulation of the gut microbiota was recently deemed one of the mechanisms responsible for the excellent outcomes of bariatric surgery. However, to date, only few studies have assessed this, and they have high heterogeneity. In the present study, next-generation 16S ribosomal DNA amplicon sequencing was used to characterize the gut microbiota of healthy volunteers, as well as patients prior to and after sleeve gastrectomy (SG) or Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). Significant differences in α diversity, β diversity and species were identified between the different groups/time-points. The results demonstrated excellent outcomes of SG and RYGB. The β diversity was lower in healthy volunteers compared with that in morbidly obese patients with or without type 2 diabetes mellitus. At 3 months after SG, the α diversity was increased and the β diversity was decreased. The abundance of certain species changed significantly after SG and RYGB. It was also revealed that the abundance of certain microbes was significantly correlated with the body mass index, fasting blood glucose and glycosylated haemoglobin. It may be concluded that bariatric surgery may cause obvious alterations in the gut microbiota and compared with healthy volunteers and obese patients without bariatric surgery, the microbiota composition of post-bariatric surgery has unique characteristics. However, studies with a larger cohort and longer follow-up may be required to confirm these results.",Chrysin protects against renal ischemia reperfusion induced tubular cell apoptosis and inflammation in mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867710,Experimental and therapeutic medicine,2019 03 29,"Renal ischemia reperfusion (IR) is a major cause of acute kidney injury with no effective treatment. Chrysin is an anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant and anti-cancer agent. However, the effect of chrysin on renal IR injury remains unknown. In this study, sham operation, IR and IR+chrysin group mice were treated with or without renal IR injury. For renal IR, bilateral renal pedicles were clamped for 30 min and then released for 48 h of reperfusion. Blood and kidney samples were collected for analysis. Results demonstrated that chrysin pretreatment remarkably decreased the levels of serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen and attenuated morphological abnormalities in renal IR injury. Consistently, tubular cell apoptosis and inflammation were more attenuated in the chrysin pretreatment group compared with the IR group. Chrysin pretreatment decreased the expression of Bax and cleaved caspase-3 and increased the expression of Bcl-2 in renal IR injury. Furthermore, chrysin administration decreased the mRNA and protein levels of tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, and IL-6. Furthermore, the IκBα/nuclear factor-κB signaling pathway was more suppressed in the chrysin pretreatment group compared with the IR group. In conclusion, chrysin protects against tubular cell apoptosis and inflammation in renal IR injury.",Efficacy of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell transplantation in animal models of pulmonary fibrosis after exposure to bleomycin: A meta-analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867709,Experimental and therapeutic medicine,2019 03 29,"Previous studies have demonstrated that bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell (BMSC) transplantation is a promising treatment strategy for pulmonary fibrosis. Although encouraging results have been obtained using animal models of bleomycin (BLM)-induced pulmonary fibrosis, it is evident that transplantation of BMSCs at various time-points after BLM administration has produced different results in terms of treatment efficacy. To shed light on the potential utility of BMSCs for the treatment of lung disease, the present study performed a meta-analysis to estimate the efficacy of BMSCs in animal models of BLM-induced pulmonary fibrosis, and compare early transplantation (BMSCs injected on the same day after administration of BLM) with late transplantation (BMSCs injected on the 14th day after administration of BLM). Relevant studies were retrieved from the MEDLINE, PubMed, Chinese Knowledge Infrastructure and WanFang databases using a comprehensive search approach. A total of 6 studies involving 228 model rats were included. Meta-analysis indicated that early BMSC transplantation was able to prevent or reduce BLM-induced alveolitis and pulmonary fibrosis, while late BMSC transplantation was able to reduce alveolitis, but there was no significant evidence regarding improvement of pulmonary fibrosis. Although BMSC therapy was identified to be generally beneficial in rodent models of BLM-induced pulmonary fibrosis, the efficacy of early transplantation appears to be more satisfactory; overall, the efficacy of transplantation of BMSCs at the acute inflammatory phase was more effective compared with that at the chronic fibrosis stage. Of note, regarding alveolitis and pulmonary fibrosis scores after late transplantation of BMSCs, the sensitivity analysis revealed that the scores were less stable; thus, this result must be interpreted with caution. Furthermore, the quality and methodology of the included studies was comparatively low. Therefore, higher-quality and more rigorous studies are required to validate the results of the present meta-analysis in the future.",Resveratrol suppresses proliferation and induces apoptosis of uterine sarcoma cells by inhibiting the Wnt signaling pathway.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867708,Experimental and therapeutic medicine,2019 03 29,"Resveratrol, a natural product and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) agonist, has been reported to exert anti-cancer effects in several tumor models. A previous study by our group reported that prostaglandin J2, a PPARγ ligand, inhibited cell proliferation in a uterine sarcoma cell line. The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of the Wnt signaling pathway in resveratrol-induced apoptosis and inhibition of cell proliferation in the MES-SA human uterine sarcoma cell line. A WST-1 assay demonstrated that resveratrol inhibited cell proliferation in the MES-SA cell line, and flow cytometry revealed that the number of apoptotic cells increased in a resveratrol dose-dependent manner. The mechanisms underlying these effects of resveratrol were speculated to involve the expression of β-catenin and its target gene, c-myc, which were examined using western blot analysis. The results revealed a dose-dependent downregulation of this β-catenin and c-myc. This effect was blunted by a pharmacological inhibitor of glycogen synthase kinase 3β. Therefore, it is likely that resveratrol inhibited the cell proliferation and increased the number of apoptotic cells, at least partially, via the Wnt signaling pathway. The present results suggest that resveratrol is a potential candidate for the treatment of uterine sarcoma.",Role of microRNA-150-5p/SRCIN1 axis in the progression of breast cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867707,Experimental and therapeutic medicine,2019 03 29,"In China, breast cancer is the most commonly occurring cancer in women. MicroRNAs (miRs) are a group of endogenous small non-coding RNAs, which serve a role in many biological processes through the regulation of target genes. In the current study, miR-150-5p expression was significantly up-regulated in breast cancer tissues and cell lines. To investigate the cellular function and underlying molecular mechanism of miR-150-5p in breast cancer, TargetScan7.2 was used to identify miR-150-5p target genes. SRC kinase signaling inhibitor 1 (SRCIN1) was identified as a direct target gene of miR-150-5p and the current study demonstrated that SRCIN1 was negatively regulated by miR-150-5p in breast cancer cells. Furthermore, SRCIN1 expression was significantly down-regulated in breast cancer tissues and cell lines. Taken together, these results demonstrated that there was a negative association between miR-150-5p and SRCIN1 in breast cancer. The CCK-8 and Transwell assays were used to examine breast cancer cell viability, invasion and migration ability. The current study demonstrated that over-expression of miR-150-5p enhanced breast cancer cell proliferation, invasion and migration. In addition, miR-150-5p over-expression increased the expression of mesenchymal cell markers (vimentin, N-cadherin and β-catenin) and decreased the expression of epithelial cell markers (E-cadherin and zonula occludens-1). By contrast, miR-150-5p knockdown inhibited breast cancer cell viability, invasion and migration. Additionally, miR-150-5p knockdown decreased the expression of mesenchymal cell markers and increased the expression of epithelial cell markers. Taken together, these results suggest that the miR-150-5p/SRCIN1 axis may be a potential target in the treatment of breast cancer."

In order to reduce the mortality of newborns, we need to find the target genes which affect the preterm and understand their mechanism. It has been verified that microRNA (miRNA)-200 and miRNA-182 are closely related to the incidence of preterm. Therefore, it is significant to predict the target genes which are regulated by them for further understanding the mechanism of preterm. We chose the targetscore method for calculating the variational Bayesian-Gaussian mixture model (VB-GMM) as the target genes prediction method. It is designed for condition-specific target predictions and not limited to predict conserved genes, so the results are more accurate than previous sequence-based target prediction algorithms. In this study, our major contribution is to predict the target mRNAs of the chosen miRNAs with the gene expression profiles and a new method, which can effectively improve the accuracy of the prediction.",Downregulation of microRNA-374a predicts poor prognosis in human glioma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867694,Experimental and therapeutic medicine,2019 03 29,"Certain microRNAs (miRNAs/miRs) may be used as prognostic biomarkers in various types of cancer. The purpose of the present study was to identify miRNAs that were abnormally expressed in glioma of different grades, and to evaluate their clinical implications in patients with glioma. The differentially expressed miRNAs were evaluated from the expression profiles of six glioma tissues (three low-grade and three high-grade gliomas) determined using a microarray platform. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis was used to further verify the aberrant expression of the candidate miRNA in a set of 42 patients and 5 healthy controls. The miRNA target genes were predicted and the protein-protein interaction network was generated; furthermore, functional enrichment analysis of the target genes in Gene Ontology (GO) terms and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways was performed. Kaplan-Meier curves and Log-rank analysis, as well as multivariate Cox regression analysis were performed to assess the association of the candidate miRNA with patient survival. A total of 15 differentially expressed miRNAs, including 13 downregulated and 2 upregulated miRNAs, were identified by comparison of low-grade and high-grade glioma tissues. The miR-374a expression of high-grade gliomas was significantly lower than that of low-grade gliomas (fold change, -4.43; P=0.027). The expression levels of miR-374a gradually decreased with the increase of the pathological grade of glioma. Pearson's Chi-square test was used to determine the association of miR-374a expression with several clinicopathological factors. Furthermore, low expression of miR-374a was determined to be an independent prognostic marker and that it was significantly associated with overall survival (P=0.0213). GO and KEGG pathway analysis revealed that the target genes of miR-374a may be involved in the regulation of the RNA polymerase II promoter and mTOR signaling pathway. The four hub genes (CCND1, SP1, CDK4, CDK6) were also identified by PPI network analysis. In conclusion, the present study indicated that miR-374a may be used as a promising prognostic biomarker for the screening of high-risk populations and for the assessment of the prognosis of patients with glioma.",Effect of baicalin on renal function in patients with diabetic nephropathy and its therapeutic mechanism.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867693,Experimental and therapeutic medicine,2019 03 29,"The present study observed the effect of baicalin on blood glucose and renal function in patients with diabetic nephropathy and explored its mechanism of action. A total of 95 patients diagnosed with diabetic nephropathy by clinical and laboratory examinations were selected and randomly divided into a control and treatment group. The control group included 45 patients who were treated with routine symptomatic treatment. The remaining 50 patients in the treatment group received baicalin, in addition to routine symptomatic treatment. The treatment course was 6 months. Following this, the changes of indicators such as fasting plasma glucose (FPG), glycosylated hemoglobin (HBA1c), aldose reductase (AR) activity, 24-h urinary microalbumin, urinary β2-microglobulin (β2-MG) and urinary albumin excretion rate (UAER) were compared before and after treatment; at the same time, the variations of indexes, including superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-px), nuclear factor κ-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB), transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were detected. Compared with those in the control group, baicalin had little effect on the treatment group's FPG and HBA1c, but it clearly reduced the AR activity and the difference was significant (P<0.05). Baicalin visibly decreased the 24-h urinary microalbumin, urinary β2-MG and UAER (P<0.05) and had notable effect on improving renal function. Following treatment, compared with those in the control group, baicalin distinctly increased the levels of SOD and GSH-px (P<0.05) and decreased the content of NF-κB and VEGF (P<0.05), however, its impact on the expression of TGF-β1 was not statistically significant (P>0.05). The results showed that baicalin may improve the renal function in patients with diabetic nephropathy and delay the progression of diabetic nephropathy through various ways, including anti-inflammation and anti-oxidation.",Anti-bacterial activity of mutant chensinin-1 peptide against multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and its effects on biofilm-associated gene expression.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867692,Experimental and therapeutic medicine,2019 03 29,"Nosocomial infections with Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) are difficult to treat due to the low outer membrane permeability of the bacterium and the development of resistance. In the present study, the anti-microbial peptide (AMP) mutant chensinin-1 (MC1) was revealed to exhibit anti-bacterial activity against a multidrug-resistant PA (MRPA) strain in vitro, and the minimum inhibitory concentration was 25 µM, which was 4-fold higher than that of the native strain. MC1 was able to disrupt the integrity of the cytoplasmic membrane in the native PA strain and MRPA and had a similar membrane depolarization ability in these strains, but the outer membrane permeability of MRPA cells was lower than that of native PA cells, as determined by a 1-N-phenylnaphthylamine assay. In addition, the abundance of the gene Psl encoding for biofilm-associated polysaccharides was detected using Congo red, and a high concentration of MC1 inhibited the formation of MRPA biofilms. Furthermore, the expression levels of biofilm-associated genes affected by the AMP, MC1, were quantified by polymerase chain reaction analysis. The results indicated that MC1 induced biofilm inhibition by downregulating the relative expression of specific biofilm polysaccharide-associated genes, including pelA, algD and pslA. The present results indicated that the AMP MC1 may be an effective antibiotic against MRPA strains.",Evaluation of complications of totally implantable central venous port system insertion.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867691,Experimental and therapeutic medicine,2019 03 29,"The aim of the present study was to describe the procedure of totally implantable central venous port system (TICVPS) insertion performed at our center and investigate associated complications. The study retrospectively evaluated 827 patients who underwent a single-type TICVPS insertion from January 2013 to July 2015. The length of the procedure, long-term device function, angle (chamber-to-tip) and complications of TICVPS, including infection, skin erosion, occlusion, malposition and thrombosis, were analyzed from the patients' medical records. A total of 843 TICVPS insertions were performed in 827 patients. The TICVPS implantation was successful in all cases (100%). A total of 34 cases (4.0%) with complications were recorded. Complications at the chamber insertion site occurred in 11 patients (1.3%), including 5 infection (0.6%) and 6 erosion cases (0.7%). All patients with chamber insertion site infection were treated by administration of antibiotics and dressing. Of the patients in which chamber insertion site erosion occurred, 2 were subjected to TICVPS removal and reinsertion and 4 were treated with debridement, irrigation and resuture. The most common type of complication was catheter-associated (2.3%; n=19). Among these cases, 7 had catheter-associated infection (0.8%), 8 had catheter migration (1.0%) confirmed by chest radiography, 4 had catheter-associated thrombosis (0.5%) and 2 had chamber malposition (0.3%). The present retrospective study on TICVPS, which used a relatively large cohort, demonstrated a low complication rate (4.0%) compared with that reported in previous studies (5-20%). A well-designed procedure, experienced vascular surgeons, an aseptic operating room environment, ultrasound-guided puncture, a wide angle (chamber-to-tip) and the use of fluoroscopy with contrast agent may reduce the complication rate of TICVPS insertion.","Epidemiology, diagnosis and treatment of moyamoya disease.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867689,Experimental and therapeutic medicine,2019 03 29,"Moyamoya disease (MMD) is a type of chronic cerebrovascular occlusion disease, which frequently occurs in East Asian populations, including pediatric and adult patients, and may lead to ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, headache, epilepsy or transient ischemic attack. To date, the underlying mechanisms of MMD have remained to be fully elucidated, but certain studies have indicated that genetic factors may be an important component of its development. Cerebral angiography is the best approach for diagnosing MMD. However, with technological advances, non-invasive techniques are increasingly used to accurately evaluate MMD. MMD is commonly treated via surgery, and an increasing number of patients are benefitting from the intra- and extra-cranial revascularization. The present article provides a comprehensive review of MMD on the basis of previous research.",MicroRNA-186 promotes cell proliferation and inhibits cell apoptosis in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma by targeting RETREG1.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867688,Experimental and therapeutic medicine,2019 03 29,"MicroRNAs (miRs), a class of small non-coding RNAs, have been demonstrated to be involved in the development and progression of human malignancies, including cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC). miR-186 serves a suppressive role in certain common types of human cancer; however, its exact function in CSCC has not been reported previously. In the present study, the expression of miR-186 was significantly increased in CSCC tissues compared with adjacent non-tumour tissues. Overexpression of miR-186 significantly promoted CSCC cell proliferation while inhibiting cell apoptosis. Reticulophagy regulator 1 (RETREG1), a gene that is significantly downregulated in CSCC tissues and cell lines, was identified as a novel target of miR-186. In addition, the expression of RETREG1 was inversely correlated with miR-186 expression in CSCC tissues. Furthermore, the expression of RETREG1 was negatively regulated by miR-186 in CSCC cells, and restoration of RETREG1 attenuated the effects of miR-186 on CSCC cells. Taken together, the results of the current study suggest that miR-186 serves an oncogenic role in CSCC and may be used as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of this disease.",Long non-coding RNA HIF1A-AS1 is upregulated in intracranial aneurysms and participates in the regulation of proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells by upregulating TGF-β1.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867687,Experimental and therapeutic medicine,2019 03 29,"Long non-coding (lnc)RNA hypoxia inducible factor 1α-antisense RNA 1 (HIF1A-AS1) not only participates in different types of malignancies, but also serves pivotal roles in thoracic aortic aneurysms, which suggests its possible involvement in intracranial aneurysms. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate its involvement in intracranial aneurysms. Expression levels of HIF1A-AS1 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 in the blood of patients with intracranial aneurysms and healthy controls were detected using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The diagnostic value of blood HIF1A-AS1 for intracranial aneurysms was analyzed using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. A HIF1A-AS1 expression vector was constructed and transfected into human vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and the effects on cell proliferation and TGF-β1 expression were explored using the Cell Counting kit-8 assay and western blot analysis, respectively. Upregulated HIF1A-AS1 expression levels in blood were observed in patients with intracranial aneurysms when compared with controls. Notably, upregulated HIF1A-AS1 expression effectively distinguished patients with intracranial aneurysms from healthy controls. Furthermore, HIF1A-AS1 and TGF-β1 expression levels were positively correlated with intracranial aneurysms. HIF1A-AS1 overexpression also upregulated TGF-β1 expression and inhibited VSMC proliferation. Although TGF-β1 treatment had no significant effect on HIF1A-AS1 expression, TGF-β inhibitor significantly reduced the effects of HIF1A-AS1 overexpression on cell proliferation. It was therefore concluded that HIF1A-AS1 may participate in intracranial aneurysms by regulating VSMC proliferation through the upregulation of TGF-β1.",Insulin-like growth factor 2 promotes the adipogenesis of hemangioma-derived stem cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867686,Experimental and therapeutic medicine,2019 03 29,"Infantile hemangioma (IH), which is the most common tumor in infants, is characterized by rapid proliferation followed by spontaneous regression into fibro-fatty tissue in childhood. However, its specific mechanism has not been clarified. Our previous studies showed that insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF-2) is increased in the proliferative phase of IH, which is deemed to form from hemangioma-derived stem cells (HemSC). However, it remains unclear whether IGF-2 can promote the adipogenic differentiation of HemSCs and the signaling mechanisms involved require further elucidation. In the present study, CCK-8 assay was used to detect the effect of different concentrations of IGF-2 on the proliferation of HemSCs. Immunohistochemistry was applied to observe the expression of IGF-2 and its receptors in cells. Oil red o-staining of adipogenesis was conducted after cells recevied no treatment or were induced with IGF-2 or IGF-2 plus OSI-906 for 10 days. Cells were cultured in EGM-2/FBS-10% alone or containing IGF-2, IGF-2 plus OSI-906 or IGF-2 plus LY294002 and the protein expression of C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, PPARγ, adiponectin, p-AKT and total AKT was determined using western blot analysis. In another experiment, cells were treated with 25, 50 or 100 μM propranolol, or vehicle. C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, PPARγ and IGF-2 were analyzed using western blot analysis or reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Results indicated that IGF-2 significantly promoted the cell proliferation and lipid accumulation of HemSCs. The expression of phosphorylated AKT (p-AKT), C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, PPARγ and adiponectin was increased in IGF-2-treated HemSCs culture, whereas these changes were repressed by the inhibition of either the IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) or phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K). Our previous research showed that propranolol accelerated adipogenesis in HemSCs and induced the upregulation of IGF-2. The results of the present study indicate that IGF-2 is able to accelerate adipogenesis, and the propranolol-induced promotion of dysregulated adipogenesis may be mediated by the IGF-2 via IGF-1R and PI3K pathways.",MicroRNA-375 inhibits esophageal squamous cell carcinoma proliferation through direct targeting of SP1.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867685,Experimental and therapeutic medicine,2019 03 29,"Several studies have shown that microRNA-375 (miR-375) is frequently downregulated in several types of human cancer including gastric cancer, colorectal cancer and oral squamous cell carcinoma. However, the role of miR-375 in human esophageal cancer remains unknown. In the current study, the expression level of miR-375 was analyzed in 43 esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) tissue and matched adjacent normal tissue samples from patients with ESCC by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. In addition, the expression level of miR-375 was analyzed in ESCC cell lines (KYSE450 and KYSE150) and the human esophageal epithelial cell line Het-1A by the same method. The expression level of miR-375 was significantly downregulated in ESCC tissue samples and cell lines compared with adjacent normal tissue samples and the human esophageal epithelial cell line, respectively. The effect of miR-375 on ESCC cell proliferation was detected by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) and colony formation assays. miR-375 overexpression significantly decreased ESCC cell proliferation and colony formation. Bioinformatics analysis was used to predict specificity protein 1 (SP1) as a target gene of miR-375 in ESCC, and this was verified by dual-luciferase assay. The present study demonstrated that SP1 regulates ESCC cell proliferation and colony formation through direct interaction with miR-375. In addition, the overall survival of patients with ESCC was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test. The results indicated that patients with ESCC with high miR-375 expression had a better survival rate compared with patients with ESCC with low miR-375 expression. Taken together, these results suggest that downregulated miR-375 promotes ESCC cell proliferation and colony formation via direct targeting of SP1, and this association may contribute to ESCC progression."

Previous evidence has indicated that dysbiosis of the gut microbiota occurs after environmental dust exposure and is associated with certain diseases. The aims of this study are to elucidate the compositional and functional characteristics of the gut microbiota in early-stage silicosis and to understand their influence on pulmonary fibrosis. We investigated the gut microbial composition of fecal samples from 18 patients and 21 healthy subjects using 16S rRNA gene sequencing technology. Compared with the healthy subjects, reductions in the levels of Firmicutes and Actinobacteria were noted in patients with silicosis and progressive pulmonary fibrosis, as well as lower levels of Devosia, Clostridiales, AlloprevotellaandRikenellaceae_RC9. Lachnospiraceae and Lachnoclostridium levels were increased in patients with silicosis. GOC and KEGG analyses were used to predict that certain bacteria taxa play critical roles in the development of pulmonary fibrosis, including posttranslational modification, amino acid transport and metabolism, nucleotide transport and metabolism, and ribosomal structure and biogenesis. KEGG analysis showed that certain taxa participate in various roles including cancer, endocrine metabolism, immune system, signaling molecules and interaction, and transcription. Collectively, in this pilot study, microbiota changes have been represented in the gut of patients with silicosis. Although this change in gut microbiota have been represented, caution is needed when interpreting the findings since this is observational finding, not necessarily causative. More studies should be performed in the expanding population to be verified and more studies underlying biological mechanisms for better understanding the relationship between gut microbiota and development of pulmonary fibrosis in patients with silicosis.",Ethnopharmacology Study of Plants from Atlantic Forest with Leishmanicidal Activity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867670,Evidence-based complementary and alternative medicine : eCAM,2019 03 29,"Leishmaniasis is an infectious disease caused by a protozoan belonging to Leishmania genus. Different clinical outcomes can be observed depending on the parasite species and patient's health condition. The outcomes can range from single cutaneous lesions to lethal visceral form. The treatment of all forms of leishmaniasis is based on pentavalent antimonials, and, in some cases, the second-line drug, amphotericin B, is used. Beside the toxicity of both classes of drugs, in some areas of the world, parasites are resistant to antimonial. These detrimental features make fundamental the discovery and characterization of new drugs or plant extracts with leishmanicidal effects. Brazil is a well-known country for its biodiversity. Additionally, the common knowledge inherited for generations in small villages makes Brazil a source of new information and resources for the discovery and development of new drugs. Based on ethnopharmacology, elderlies were interviewed about plants they commonly used for skin diseases and infections. Five native plants from Atlantic forest were indicated; EtOH and n-hexane extracts were prepared with the vegetative organs of the plants and assayed against promastigote and amastigote forms of L. (L.) amazonensis. The major molecules of each extract were detected using qualitative nuclear magnetic resonance. Among all tested extracts, the n-hexane extract from the leave of Eugenia uniflora (Myrtaceae), enriched in myricitrin and quercitrin flavonoids, was the most effective against L. (L.) amazonensis amastigotes. This data supports the ethnopharmacology approach as a successful tool for the discovery of new drugs with leishmanicidal effects.",Naomaitai Ameliorated Brain Damage in Rats with Vascular Dementia by PI3K/PDK1/AKT Signaling Pathway.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867669,Evidence-based complementary and alternative medicine : eCAM,2019 03 29,Naomaitai can improve blood perfusion and ameliorate the damage in the paraventricular white matter.

Contra- and ipsilateral moxibustion were separately applied to Zusanli (ST36) acupoints of inflammatory pain mice. The analgesic effect was evaluated, respectively, by licking/biting time (LBT) of formalin-induced inflammatory pain and thermal withdrawal latency (TWL) of complete Freund's adjuvant- (CFA-) induced inflammatory pain. For formalin-induced pain, compared with formalin group, the total LBT of ipsi- and contralateral moxibustion reduced in both phase I and phase II, but there was no significant difference between ipsi- and contralateral moxibustion. For CFA-induced inflammatory pain, compared with CFA group, TWL of ipsi- and contra-Moxi groups increased immediately after moxibustion intervention; however there was no obvious difference between ipsi- and contralateral moxibustion at any timepoint. It indicated that contralateral moxibustion had a similar analgesic effect with ipsilateral moxibustion in both formalin- and CFA-induced pain. These results suggest that both ipsi- and contralateral moxibustion could be applied for pain relief.",CXCR4-Overexpressing Umbilical Cord Mesenchymal Stem Cells Enhance Protection against Radiation-Induced Lung Injury.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867667,Stem cells international,2019 03 29,"Less quantity of transplanted mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) influences the therapeutic effects on radiation-induced lung injury (RILI). Previous studies have demonstrated that MSCs overexpressing Chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor 4 (CXCR4) could increase the quantity of transplanted cells to local tissues. In the present study, we conducted overexpressing CXCR4 human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell (HUMSC) therapy for RILI. C57BL mice received single dose of thoracic irradiation with 13 Gy of X-rays and then were administered saline, control HUMSCs, or CXCR4-overexpressing HUMSCs via tail vein. Transfection with CXCR4 enhanced the quantity of transplanted HUMSCs in the radiation-induced injured lung tissues. CXCR4-overexpressing HUMSCs not only improved histopathological changes but also decreased the radiation-induced expression of SDF-1, TGF-β1, α-SMA, and collagen I and inhibited the radiation-induced decreased expression of E-cadherin. Transplanted CXCR4-overexpressing HUMSCs also could express pro-SP-C, indicated adopting the feature of ATII.

This sensitivity has been exploited successfully for chemical and biological assays. In these systems, a surface plasmon resonance (SPR)-based sensor detects temporal variations in the refractive index at a point. SPR has also been used in imaging systems where the spatial variations of refractive index in the sample provide the contrast mechanism. SPR imaging systems using high numerical aperture (NA) objective lenses have been designed to image adherent live cells with high magnification and near-diffraction limited spatial resolution. Addressing research questions in cell physiology and pharmacology often requires the development of a multimodal microscope where complementary information can be obtained. In this paper, we present the development of a multimodal microscope that combines SPR imaging with a number of additional imaging modalities including bright-field, epifluorescence, total internal reflection microscopy and SPR fluorescence microscopy. We used a high NA objective lens for SPR and TIR microscopy and the platform has been used to image live cell cultures demonstrating both fluorescent and label-free techniques. Both the SPR and TIR imaging systems feature a wide field of view (~300 µm) that allows measurements from multiple cells whilst maintaining a resolution sufficient to image fine cellular processes. The capability of the platform to perform label-free functional imaging of living cells was demonstrated by imaging the spatial variations in contractions from stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes. This technique shows promise for non-invasive imaging of cultured cells over very long periods of time during development.",A distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud that is precise to one per cent.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867610,Nature,2019 03 14,"In the era of precision cosmology, it is essential to determine the Hubble constant empirically with an accuracy of one per cent or better1. At present, the uncertainty on this constant is dominated by the uncertainty in the calibration of the Cepheid period-luminosity relationship2,3 (also known as the Leavitt law). The Large Magellanic Cloud has traditionally served as the best galaxy with which to calibrate Cepheid period-luminosity relations, and as a result has become the best anchor point for the cosmic distance scale4,5. Eclipsing binary systems composed of late-type stars offer the most precise and accurate way to measure the distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud. Currently the limit of the precision attainable with this technique is about two per cent, and is set by the precision of the existing calibrations of the surface brightness-colour relation5,6. Here we report a calibration of the surface brightness-colour relation with a precision of 0.8 per cent. We use this calibration to determine a geometrical distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud that is precise to 1 per cent based on 20 eclipsing binary systems.

Kernel methods for machine learning are ubiquitous in pattern recognition, with support vector machines (SVMs) being the best known method for classification problems. However, there are limitations to the successful solution to such classification problems when the feature space becomes large, and the kernel functions become computationally expensive to estimate. A core element in the computational speed-ups enabled by quantum algorithms is the exploitation of an exponentially large quantum state space through controllable entanglement and interference. Here we propose and experimentally implement two quantum algorithms on a superconducting processor. A key component in both methods is the use of the quantum state space as feature space. The use of a quantum-enhanced feature space that is only efficiently accessible on a quantum computer provides a possible path to quantum advantage. The algorithms solve a problem of supervised learning: the construction of a classifier. One method, the quantum variational classifier, uses a variational quantum circuit1,2 to classify the data in a way similar to the method of conventional SVMs. The other method, a quantum kernel estimator, estimates the kernel function on the quantum computer and optimizes a classical SVM. The two methods provide tools for exploring the applications of noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers3 to machine learning.",Self-formed bedrock waterfalls.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867607,Nature,2019 03 14,"Waterfalls are inspiring landforms that set the pace of landscape evolution as a result of bedrock incision1-3. They communicate changes in sea level or tectonic uplift throughout landscapes2,4 or stall river incision, disconnecting landscapes from downstream perturbations3,5. Here we use a flume experiment with constant water discharge and sediment feed to show that waterfalls can form from a planar, homogeneous bedrock bed in the absence of external perturbations. In our experiment, instabilities between flow hydraulics, sediment transport and bedrock erosion lead to undulating bedforms, which grow to become waterfalls. We propose that it is plausible that the origin of some waterfalls in natural systems can be attributed to this intrinsic formation process and we suggest that investigations to distinguish self-formed from externally forced waterfalls may help to improve the reconstruction of Earth history from landscapes.",Site-selective and versatile aromatic C-H functionalization by thianthrenation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867606,Nature,2019 03 14,"Direct C-H functionalization can quickly increase useful structural and functional molecular complexity1-3. Site selectivity can sometimes be achieved through appropriate directing groups or substitution patterns1-4-in the absence of such functionality, most aromatic C-H functionalization reactions provide more than one product isomer for most substrates1,4,5. Development of a C-H functionalization reaction that proceeds with high positional selectivity and installs a functional group that can serve as a synthetic linchpin for further functionalization would provide access to a large variety of well-defined arene derivatives. Here we report a highly selective aromatic C-H functionalization reaction that does not require a particular directing group or substitution pattern to achieve selectivity, and provides functionalized arenes that can participate in various transformations. We introduce a persistent sulfur-based radical to functionalize complex arenes with high selectivity and obtain thianthrenium salts that are ready to engage in different transformations, via both transition-metal and photoredox catalysis. This transformation differs fundamentally from all previous aromatic C-H functionalization reactions in that it provides direct access to a large number of derivatives of complex small molecules, quickly generating functional diversity with selectivity that is not achievable by other methods.",AMP-activated protein kinase: the current landscape for drug development.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867601,Nature reviews.

While exercise, caloric restriction, metformin and many natural products increase AMPK activity and exert a multitude of health benefits, developing direct activators of AMPK to elicit beneficial effects has been challenging. However, in recent years, direct AMPK activators have been identified and tested in preclinical models, and a small number have entered clinical trials. Despite these advances, which disease(s) represent the best indications for therapeutic AMPK activation and the long-term safety of such approaches remain to be established.",Feature-selective encoding of substrate vibrations in the forelimb somatosensory cortex.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867600,Nature,2019 03 20,"The spectral content of skin vibrations, produced by either displacing the finger across a surface texture1 or passively sensing external movements through the solid substrate2,3, provides fundamental information about our environment. Low-frequency flutter (below 50 Hz) applied locally to the primate fingertip evokes cyclically entrained spiking in neurons of the primary somatosensory cortex (S1), and thus spike rates in these neurons increase linearly with frequency4,5. However, the same local vibrations at high frequencies (over 100 Hz) cannot be discriminated on the basis of differences in discharge rates of S1 neurons4,6, because spiking is only partially entrained at these frequencies6. Here we investigated whether high-frequency substrate vibrations applied broadly to the mouse forelimb rely on a different cortical coding scheme. We found that forelimb S1 neurons encode vibration frequency similarly to sound pitch representation in the auditory cortex7,8: their spike rates are selectively tuned to a preferred value of a low-level stimulus feature without any temporal entrainment. This feature, identified as the product of frequency and a power function of amplitude, was also found to be perceptually relevant as it predicted behaviour in a frequency discrimination task. Using histology, peripheral deafferentation and optogenetic receptor tagging, we show that these selective responses are inherited from deep Pacinian corpuscles located adjacent to bones, most densely around the ulna and radius and only sparsely along phalanges. This mechanoreceptor arrangement and the tuned cortical rate code suggest that the mouse forelimb constitutes a sensory channel best adapted for passive 'listening' to substrate vibrations, rather than for active texture exploration."

Current treatments cause undesirable adverse effects, and a large unmet clinical need remains for treatments that offer disease modification and that address symptoms resistant to levodopa. Advances in high-throughput drug screening methods for small molecules, developments in disease modelling and improvements in analytical technologies have collectively contributed to the emergence of novel compounds, repurposed drugs and new technologies. In this Review, we focus on disease-modifying and symptomatic therapies under development for PD. We review cellular therapies and repurposed drugs, such as nilotinib, inosine, isradipine, iron chelators and anti-inflammatories, and discuss how their success in preclinical models has paved the way for clinical trials. We provide an update on immunotherapies and vaccines. In addition, we review non-pharmacological interventions targeting motor symptoms, including gene therapy, adaptive deep brain stimulation (DBS) and optogenetically inspired DBS.

Here we address this problem by reconstructing 60,664 draft prokaryotic genomes from 3,810 faecal metagenomes, from geographically and phenotypically diverse humans. These genomes provide reference points for 2,058 newly identified species-level operational taxonomic units (OTUs), which represents a 50% increase over the previously known phylogenetic diversity of sequenced gut bacteria. On average, the newly identified OTUs comprise 33% of richness and 28% of species abundance per individual, and are enriched in humans from rural populations. A meta-analysis of clinical gut-microbiome studies pinpointed numerous disease associations for the newly identified OTUs, which have the potential to improve predictive models. Finally, our analysis revealed that uncultured gut species have undergone genome reduction that has resulted in the loss of certain biosynthetic pathways, which may offer clues for improving cultivation strategies in the future.",A novel approach for assessment of prostate cancer aggressiveness using survivin-driven tumour-activatable minicircles.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867586,Gene therapy,2019 05 24,"Early and accurate detection of cancer is essential to optimising patient outcomes. Of particular importance to prostate cancer is the ability to determine the aggressiveness of a primary tumour, which allows for effective management of patient care. In this work, we propose using gene vectors called tumour-activatable minicircles which deliver an exogenously encoded reporter gene into cancer cells, forcing them to produce a unique and sensitive biomarker. These minicircles express a blood reporter protein called secreted embryonic alkaline phosphatase mediated by the tumour-specific survivin promoter, which exhibits activity graded to prostate cancer aggressiveness. Together, these components underlie a detection system where levels of blood reporter are indicative of not only the presence, but also the metastatic potential of a tumour. Our goal was to assess the ability of tumour-activatable minicircles to detect and characterise primary prostate lesions. Our minicircles produced reporter levels related to survivin expression across a range of prostate cancer cell lines. When survivin-driven minicircles were administered intratumourally into mice, reporter levels in blood samples were significantly higher (p < 0.05) in mice carrying prostate tumours of high versus low-aggressiveness. Continued development of this gene-based system could provide clinicians with a powerful tool to evaluate prostate cancer aggressiveness using a sensitive and affordable blood assay.","The microbiomes of deep-sea hydrothermal vents: distributed globally, shaped locally.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867583,Nature reviews. Microbiology,2019 04 13,"The discovery of chemosynthetic ecosystems at deep-sea hydrothermal vents in 1977 changed our view of biology. Chemosynthetic bacteria and archaea form the foundation of vent ecosystems by exploiting the chemical disequilibrium between reducing hydrothermal fluids and oxidizing seawater, harnessing this energy to fix inorganic carbon into biomass. Recent research has uncovered fundamental aspects of these microbial communities, including their relationships with underlying geology and hydrothermal geochemistry, interactions with animals via symbiosis and distribution both locally in various habitats within vent fields and globally across hydrothermal systems in diverse settings. Although 'black smokers' and symbioses between microorganisms and macrofauna attract much attention owing to their novelty and the insights they provide into life under extreme conditions, habitats such as regions of diffuse flow, subseafloor aquifers and hydrothermal plumes have important roles in the global cycling of elements through hydrothermal systems. Owing to sharp contrasts in physical and chemical conditions between these various habitats and their dynamic, extreme and geographically isolated nature, hydrothermal vents provide a valuable window into the environmental and ecological forces that shape microbial communities and insights into the limits, origins and evolution of microbial life.",Helper T cell differentiation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867582,Cellular & molecular immunology,2019 03 20,"CD4+ T helper cells are key regulators of host health and disease.

We next describe the mechanisms underlying CD4+ T-cell differentiation, including cytokine-induced signaling and transcriptional networks. We then review current and emerging topics of differentiation, including the plasticity and heterogeneity of T cells, the tissue-specific effects, and the influence of cellular metabolism on cell fate decisions. Importantly, recent advances in cutting-edge approaches, especially systems biology tools, have contributed to new concepts and mechanisms underlying T-cell differentiation and will likely continue to advance this important research area of adaptive immunity.",Host tissue determinants of tumour immunity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867580,Nature reviews.

Cardiology,2019 03 20,"Cardiovascular disease is a major contributor to global morbidity and mortality and is the common end point of many chronic diseases. The endothelins comprise three structurally similar peptides of 21 amino acids in length. Endothelin 1 (ET-1) and ET-2 activate two G protein-coupled receptors - endothelin receptor type A (ETA) and endothelin receptor type B (ETB) - with equal affinity, whereas ET-3 has a lower affinity for ETA. ET-1 is the most potent vasoconstrictor in the human cardiovascular system and has remarkably long-lasting actions. ET-1 contributes to vasoconstriction, vascular and cardiac hypertrophy, inflammation, and to the development and progression of cardiovascular disease. Endothelin receptor antagonists have revolutionized the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension. Clinical trials continue to explore new applications of endothelin receptor antagonists, particularly in treatment-resistant hypertension, chronic kidney disease and patients receiving antiangiogenic therapies. Translational studies have identified important roles for the endothelin isoforms and new therapeutic targets during development, in fluid-electrolyte homeostasis, and in cardiovascular and neuronal function. Novel pharmacological strategies are emerging in the form of small-molecule epigenetic modulators, biologics (such as monoclonal antibodies for ETB) and possibly signalling pathway-biased agonists and antagonists.",Epigenetic modification: a regulatory mechanism in essential hypertension.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867575,Hypertension research : official journal of the Japanese Society of Hypertension,2019 03 20,"Essential hypertension (EH) is a multifactorial disease of the cardiovascular system that is influenced by the interplay of genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors. The molecular dynamics underlying EH etiopathogenesis is unknown; however, earlier studies have revealed EH-associated genetic variants. Nevertheless, this finding alone is not sufficient to explain the variability in blood pressure, suggesting that other risk factors are involved, such as epigenetic modifications. Therefore, this review highlights the potential contribution of well-defined epigenetic mechanisms in EH, specifically, DNA methylation, post-translational histone modifications, and microRNAs. We further emphasize global and gene-specific DNA methylation as one of the most well-studied hallmarks among all epigenetic modifications in EH. In addition, post-translational histone modifications, such as methylation, acetylation, and phosphorylation, are described as important epigenetic markers associated with EH. Finally, we discuss microRNAs that affect blood pressure by regulating master genes such as those implicated in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. These epigenetic modifications, which appear to contribute to various cardiovascular diseases, including EH, may be a promising research area for the development of novel future strategies for EH prevention and therapeutics.",Paraneoplastic neurological syndromes in the era of immune-checkpoint inhibitors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867573,Nature reviews. Clinical oncology,2019 03 20,"Paraneoplastic neurological syndromes (PNSs) comprise a group of disorders that can affect any part of the nervous system in patients with cancer and frequently result from autoimmune responses triggered by the ectopic expression of neuronal proteins in cancer cells. These disorders are rare, although the introduction of immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) into cancer treatment algorithms has renewed interest in PNSs. ICIs are associated with a considerably increased incidence of immunological toxicities compared with traditional anticancer therapies, including neurological immune-related adverse effects (nirAEs) that can manifest as PNSs. Theoretically, the use of ICIs might increase the risk of PNSs, in particular, in patients with the types of cancer that are most frequently associated with these disorders (such as small-cell lung cancer), emphasizing the importance of their prompt diagnosis and treatment to prevent irreversible neurological deficits. To facilitate the recognition of these disorders in the context of immune-checkpoint inhibition, we provide an overview of PNSs, including the main syndromes, types of neuronal autoantibodies and associated immunological mechanisms. We also review the scenarios in which nirAEs fulfil the criteria for PNSs and examine their frequency and clinical presentations.

Chemical modification of DNA is a commonly used strategy to achieve this, and it has long been argued that the emergence of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) in many species was driven by the requirement to silence TEs. Potential roles in TE regulation have also been suggested for other DNA modifications, such as N6-methyladenine and oxidation derivatives of 5mC, although the underlying mechanistic relationships are poorly understood. Here, we discuss current evidence implicating DNA modifications and DNA-modifying enzymes in TE regulation across different species."

For two stimulation targets, pivotal randomized trials have been conducted; both failed a futility analysis. We assessed efficacy and safety of DBS of the supero-lateral branch of the medial forebrain bundle (slMFB) in a small Phase I clinical study with a randomized-controlled onset of stimulation in order to obtain data for the planning of a large RCT. Sixteen patients suffering from TRD received DBS of the slMFB and were randomized to sham or real stimulation for the duration of 2 months after implantation. Primary outcome measure was mean reduction in Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) during 12 months of DBS (timeline analysis). Secondary outcomes were the difference in several clinical measures between sham and real stimulation at 8 weeks and during stimulation phases. MADRS ratings decreased significantly from 29.6 (SD +/- 4) at baseline to 12.9 (SD +/- 9) during 12 months of DBS (mean MADRS, n = 16). All patients reached the response criterion, most patients (n = 10) responded within a week; 50% of patients were classified as remitters after 1 year of stimulation. The most frequent side effect was transient strabismus. Both groups (active/sham) demonstrated an antidepressant micro-lesioning effect but patients had an additional antidepressant effect after initiation of stimulation. Both rapid onset and stability of the antidepressant effects of slMFB-DBS were demonstrated as in our previous pilot study. Given recent experiences from pivotal trials in DBS for MDD, we believe that slow, careful, and adaptive study development is germane. After our exploratory study and a large-scale study, we conducted this gateway trial in order to better inform planning of the latter. Important aspects for the planning of RCTs in the field of DBS for severe and chronic diseases are discussed including meaningful phases of intra-individual and between-group comparisons and timeline instead of single endpoint analyses.",Multimodal neurocognitive markers of interoceptive tuning in smoked cocaine.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867552,Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology,2019 06 13,"Contemporary neurocognitive models of drug addiction have associated this condition with changes in interoception -namely, the sensing and processing of body signals that fulfill homeostatic functions relevant for the onset and maintenance of addictive behavior. However, most previous evidence is inconsistent, behaviorally unspecific, and virtually null in terms of direct electrophysiological and multimodal markers. To circumvent these limitations, we conducted the first assessment of the relation between cardiac interoception and smoked cocaine dependence (SCD) in a sample of (a) 25 participants who fulfilled criteria for dependence on such a drug, (b) 22 participants addicted to insufflated clorhidrate cocaine (only for behavioral assessment), and (c) 25 healthy controls matched by age, gender, education, and socioeconomic status. We use a validated heartbeat-detection (HBD) task and measured modulations of the heart-evoked potential (HEP) during interoceptive accuracy and interoceptive learning conditions. We complemented this behavioral and electrophysiological data with offline structural (MRI) and functional connectivity (fMRI) analysis of the main interoceptive hubs. HBD and HEP results convergently showed that SCD subjects presented ongoing psychophysiological measures of enhanced interoceptive accuracy. This pattern was associated with a structural and functional tuning of interoceptive networks (reduced volume and specialized network segregation). Taken together, our findings provide the first evidence of an association between cardiac interoception and smoked cocaine, partially supporting models that propose hyper-interoception as a key aspect of addiction. More generally, our study shows that multimodal assessments of interoception could substantially inform the clinical and neurocognitive characterization of psychophysiological and neurocognitive adaptations triggered by addiction.",Intranasal naloxone rapidly occupies brain mu-opioid receptors in human subjects.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867551,Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology,2019 03 23,"Nasal spray formulations of naloxone, a mu-opioid receptor (MOR) antagonist, are currently used for the treatment of opioid overdose. They may have additional therapeutic utility also in the absence of opioid agonist drugs, but the onset and duration of action at brain MORs have been inadequately characterized to allow such projections. This study provides initial characterization of brain MOR availability at high temporal resolution following intranasal (IN) naloxone administration to healthy volunteers in the absence of a competing opioid agonist. Fourteen participants were scanned twice using positron emission tomography (PET) and [11C]carfentanil, a selective MOR agonist radioligand. Concentrations of naloxone in plasma and MOR availability (relative to placebo) were monitored from 0 to 60 min and at 300-360 min post naloxone. Naloxone plasma concentrations peaked at ~20 min post naloxone, associated with slightly delayed development of brain MOR occupancy (half of peak occupancy reached at ~10 min). Estimated peak occupancies were 67 and 85% following 2 and 4 mg IN doses, respectively. The estimated half-life of occupancy disappearance was ~100 min. The rapid onset of brain MOR occupancy by IN naloxone, evidenced by the rapid onset of its action in opioid overdose victims, was directly documented in humans for the first time. The employed high temporal-resolution PET method establishes a model that can be used to predict brain MOR occupancy from plasma naloxone concentrations. IN naloxone may have therapeutic utility in various addictions where brain opioid receptors are implicated, such as gambling disorder and alcohol use disorder.",Non-Invasive Monitoring of Functional State of Articular Cartilage Tissue with Label-Free Unsupervised Hyperspectral Imaging.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867549,Scientific reports,2019 03 29,"Damage and degradation of articular cartilage leads to severe pain and loss of mobility. The development of new therapies for cartilage regeneration for monitoring their effect requires further study of cartilage, ideally at a molecular level and in a minimally invasive way. Hyperspectral microscopy is a novel technology which utilises endogenous fluorophores to non-invasively assess the molecular composition of cells and tissue. In this study, we applied hyperspectral microscopy to healthy bovine articular cartilage and osteoarthritic human articular cartilage to investigate its capacity to generate informative molecular data and characterise disease state and treatment effects. We successfully demonstrated label-free fluorescence identification of collagen type I and II - isolated in cartilage here for the first time and the co-enzymes free NADH and FAD which together give the optical redox ratio that is an important measure of metabolic activity. The intracellular composition of chondrocytes was also examined. Differences were observed in the molecular ratios within the superficial and transitional zones of the articular cartilage which appeared to be influenced by disease state and treatment. These findings show that hyperspectral microscopy could be useful for investigating the molecular underpinnings of articular cartilage degradation and repair. As it is non-invasive and non-destructive, samples can be repeatedly assessed over time, enabling true time-course experiments with in-depth molecular data. Additionally, there is potential for the hyperspectral approach to be adapted for patient examination to allow the investigation of cartilage state. This could be of advantage for assessment and diagnosis as well as treatment monitoring.",Investigating the role of genetic counseling in neuromuscular disease considering life events.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867548,Journal of human genetics,2019 05 12,"Genetic diagnoses are becoming a routine in the medical practice of neuromuscular diseases.

Disease explanation was the most common reason for attending GC (29.4%), followed by prenatal diagnosis (25.5%), pre-symptomatic diagnosis (17.6%), and carrier diagnosis (14.7%). Clients typically visited the hospital for GC when some kind of life event occurred, such as marriage, had a desire to bear a child, or a change in the condition of the proband. Clinicians should be conscious of such life events from the perspective of both the client and their relatives, and guide the GC at an appropriate time. Overall, the degree of recognition of genetic risk by clients differed; thus, it is important for GC to determine the status of each unique situation and respond individually.","TiO2 decorated functionalized halloysite nanotubes (TiO2@HNTs) and photocatalytic PVC membranes synthesis, characterization and its application in water treatment.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867547,Scientific reports,2019 03 29,"In this study photocatalyst, TiO2@HNTs were prepared by  synthesizing TiO2 nanoparticles in situ on the  functionalized halloysite nanotubes (HNTs) surface. Photocatalytic PVC membrane TiO2@HNTs M2 (2 wt.%) and TiO2@HNTs M3 (3 wt.%) were also prepared. Photocatalyst TiO2@HNTs and photocatalytic PVC membranes were used to study the photocatalytic activity against the methylene blue (MB) and rhodamine B (RB) dyes in UV batch reactor. The structure and morphology of photocatalyst and photocatalytic PVC membrane were characterized by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray (EDX), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), UV-Vis spectrophotometer and photoluminescence (PL). The PL study showed that the oxygen vacancies and surface hydroxyl groups present on the surface of TiO2@HNTs act as excellent traps for charge carrier, reducing the electron-hole recombination rate.TiO2@HNTs 2 (2 wt.%) and TiO2@HNTs 3 (3 wt.%) degraded MB dye up to 83.21%, 87.47% and RB dye up to 96.84% and 96.87%, respectively. TiO2@HNT photocatalyst proved to be stable during the three consecutive cycle of photocatalytic degradation of the RB dye. TiO2@HNTs M2 and TiO2@HNTs M3 degraded MB dye up to 27.19%, 42.37% and RB dye up to 30.78%, 32.76%, respectively. Photocatalytic degradation of both the dyes followed the first-order kinetic model. Degradation product analysis was done using the liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and the results showed that the dye degradation was initiated by demethylation of the molecule. MB and RB dye degradation reaction were tested by TBA and IPA as OH* and H+ scavengers respectively. Mechanism of photocatalytic activity of TiO2@HNTs and photocatalytic PVC membrane were also explained.",Carbon fixation and energy metabolisms of a subseafloor olivine biofilm.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867546,The ISME journal,2019 03 14,"Earth's largest aquifer ecosystem resides in igneous oceanic crust, where chemosynthesis and water-rock reactions provide the carbon and energy that support an active deep biosphere. The Calvin Cycle is the predominant carbon fixation pathway in cool, oxic, crust; however, the energy and carbon metabolisms in the deep thermal basaltic aquifer are poorly understood. Anaerobic carbon fixation pathways such as the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway, which uses hydrogen (H2) and CO2, may be common in thermal aquifers since water-rock reactions can produce H2 in hydrothermal environments and bicarbonate is abundant in seawater. To test this, we reconstructed the metabolisms of eleven bacterial and archaeal metagenome-assembled genomes from an olivine biofilm obtained from a Juan de Fuca Ridge basaltic aquifer. We found that the dominant carbon fixation pathway was the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway, which was present in seven of the eight bacterial genomes. Anaerobic respiration appears to be driven by sulfate reduction, and one bacterial genome contained a complete nitrogen fixation pathway. This study reveals the potential pathways for carbon and energy flux in the deep anoxic thermal aquifer ecosystem, and suggests that ancient H2-based chemolithoautotrophy, which once dominated Earth's early biosphere, may thus remain one of the dominant metabolisms in the suboceanic aquifer today.",Integrating the role of antifungal bacteria into skin symbiotic communities of three Neotropical frog species.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867545,The ISME journal,2019 03 14,"Chytridiomycosis, caused by the pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), has led to population declines and extinctions of frog species around the world. While it is known that symbiotic skin bacteria can play a protective role against pathogens, it is not known how these defensive bacteria are integrated into the bacterial community on amphibian skin. In this study, we used 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, culturing and Bd inhibition bioassays to characterize the communities of skin bacteria on three Neotropical frog species that persist in a Bd-infected area in Panama and determined the abundance and integration of anti-Bd bacteria into the community. We found that the two treefrog species had a similar bacterial community structure, which differed from the more diverse community found on the terrestrial frog. Co-occurrence networks also revealed differences between frog species such that the treefrogs had a significantly higher number of culturable Bd-inhibitory OTUs with high centrality scores compared with the terrestrial frog. We found that culture-dependent OTUs captured between 21 and 39% of the total relative abundance revealed in culture-independent communities. Our results suggest different ecological strategies occurring within skin antifungal communities on host species that have not succumbed to Bd infections in the wild.",Diabetes inhibits corneal epithelial cell migration and tight junction formation in mice and human via increasing ROS and impairing Akt signaling.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867543,Acta pharmacologica Sinica,2019 03 14,"Corneal wounds usually heal quickly; but diabetic patients have more fragile corneas and experience delayed and painful healing. In the present study, we compared the healing capacity of corneal epithelial cells (CECs) between normal and diabetic conditions and the potential mechanisms. Primary murine CEC derived from wild-type and diabetic (db/db) mice, as well as primary human CEC were prepared. Human CEC were exposed to high glucose (30 mM) to mimic diabetic conditions. Cell migration and proliferation were assessed using Scratch test and MTT assays, respectively. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in the cells was measured using dichlorofluorescein reagent. Western blot was used to evaluate the expression levels of Akt. Transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) expression were used to determine tight junction integrity. We found that the diabetic CEC displayed significantly slower cell proliferation and migration compared with the normal CEC from both mice and humans. Furthermore, ROS production was markedly increased in CEC grown under diabetic conditions. Treatment with an antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine (NAC, 100 μM) significantly decreased ROS production and increased wound healing in diabetic CEC. Barrier function was significantly reduced in both diabetic mouse and human CEC, while NAC treatment mitigated these effects. We further showed that Akt signaling was impaired in diabetic CEC, which was partially improved by NAC treatment. These results show that diabetic conditions lead to delayed wound-healing capacity of CEC and impaired tight junction formation in both mice and human. Increased ROS production and inhibited Akt signaling may contribute to this outcome, implicating these as potential targets for treating corneal wounds in diabetic patients.",Metatranscriptomic exploration of microbial functioning in clouds.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867542,Scientific reports,2019 03 29,"Clouds constitute the uppermost layer of the biosphere. They host diverse communities whose functioning remains obscure, although biological activity potentially participates to atmospheric chemical and physical processes. In order to gain information on the metabolic functioning of microbial communities in clouds, we conducted coordinated metagenomics/metatranscriptomics profiling of cloud water microbial communities. Samples were collected from a high altitude atmospheric station in France and examined for biological content after untargeted amplification of nucleic acids. Living microorganisms, essentially bacteria, maintained transcriptional and translational activities and expressed many known complementary physiological responses intended to fight oxidants, osmotic variations and cold. These included activities of oxidant detoxification and regulation, synthesis of osmoprotectants/cryoprotectants, modifications of membranes, iron uptake. Consistently these energy-demanding processes were fueled by central metabolic routes involved in oxidative stress response and redox homeostasis management, such as pentose phosphate and glyoxylate pathways. Elevated binding and transmembrane ion transports demonstrated important interactions between cells and their cloud droplet chemical environments. In addition, polysaccharides, potentially beneficial for survival like exopolysaccharides, biosurfactants and adhesins, were synthesized. Our results support a biological influence on cloud physical and chemical processes, acting notably on the oxidant capacity, iron speciation and availability, amino-acids distribution and carbon and nitrogen fates."

High-throughput production of flexible TEGs is currently dominated by printing techniques, limiting material choices and performance. This work investigates the compatibility of physical vapour deposition (PVD) techniques with a flexible commercial process, roll-to-roll (R2R), for thermoelectric applications. We demonstrate, on a flexible polyimide substrate, a sputtered Bi2Te3/GeTe TEG with Seebeck coefficient (S) of 140 μV/K per pair and output power (P) of 0.4 nW per pair for a 20 °C temperature difference. For the first time, thermoelectric properties of R2R sputtered Bi2Te3 films are reported and we demonstrate the ability to tune the power factor by lowering run times, lending itself to a high-speed low-cost process. To further illustrate this high-rate PVD/R2R compatibility, we fabricate a TEG using Virtual Cathode Deposition (VCD), a novel high deposition rate PVD tool, for the first time. This Bi2Te3/Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3 TEG exhibits S = 250 μV/K per pair and P = 0.2 nW per pair for a 20 °C temperature difference.",Mesolimbic white matter connectivity mediates the preference for sweet food.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867529,Scientific reports,2019 03 29,"Dopaminergic brain structures like the nucleus accumbens (NAc) are thought to encode the incentive salience of palatable foods motivating appetitive behaviour. Animal studies have identified neural networks mediating the regulation of hedonic feeding that comprise connections of the NAc with the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and the lateral hypothalamus (LH). Here, we investigated how structural connectivity of these pathways relates to individual variability in decisions on sweet food consumption in humans. We therefore combined probabilistic tractography on diffusion imaging data from 45 overnight fasted lean to overweight participants with real decisions about high and low sugar food consumption. Across all individuals, sugar preference and connectivity strength were not directly related, however, multiple regression analysis revealed interaction of mesolimbic structure and sugar preference to depend on individuals' BMI score. In overweight individuals (BMI: ≥25 kg/m², N = 22) higher sugar preference was thereby specifically related to stronger connectivity within the VTA-NAc pathway while the opposite pattern emerged in participants with normal BMI (BMI: <25 kg/m², N = 23). Our structural results complement previous functional findings on the critical role of the human mesolimbic system for regulating hedonic eating in overweight individuals.",Loss of the Polycomb group protein Rnf2 results in derepression of tbx-transcription factors and defects in embryonic and cardiac development.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867528,Scientific reports,2019 03 29,"The Polycomb group (PcG) protein family is a well-known group of epigenetic modifiers. We used zebrafish to investigate the role of Rnf2, the enzymatic subunit of PRC1. We found a positive correlation between loss of Rnf2 and upregulation of genes, especially of those whose promoter is normally bound by Rnf2. The heart of rnf2 mutants shows a tubular shaped morphology and to further understand the underlying mechanism, we studied gene expression of single wildtype and rnf2 mutant hearts. We detected the most pronounced differences at 3 dpf, including upregulation of heart transcription factors, such as tbx2a, tbx2b, and tbx3a. These tbx genes were decorated by broad PcG domains in wildtype whole embryo lysates. Chamber specific genes such as vmhc, myh6, and nppa showed downregulation in rnf2 mutant hearts. The marker of the working myocard, nppa, is negatively regulated by Tbx2 and Tbx3. Based on our findings and literature we postulate that loss of Rnf2-mediated repression results in upregulation and ectopic expression of tbx2/3, whose expression is normally restricted to the cardiac conductive system. This could lead to repression of chamber specific gene expression, a misbalance in cardiac cell types, and thereby to cardiac defects observed in rnf2 mutants.",Sustained response to symmetry in extrastriate areas after stimulus offset: An EEG study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867527,Scientific reports,2019 03 29,"Electrophysiological (EEG) studies of human perception have found that amplitude at posterior electrodes is more negative for symmetrical patterns compared to asymmetrical patterns. This negativity lasts for hundreds of milliseconds and it has been called sustained posterior negativity (SPN). Symmetry activates a network of visual areas, including the lateral occipital complex (LOC). The SPN is a response to presence of symmetry in the image. Given the sustained nature of this activation, in this study we tested the persistence of the SPN after stimulus offset. Two shapes were presented (for 0.5 s each) with a 1 s blank interval in between. We observed a sustained response after stimulus offset, irrespective of whether the task required processing of shape information. This supports the idea that the response to symmetry is generated by information in the image, independently of task, and that it is sustained over approximately one second post stimulus onset.","Corosolic acid isolated from Eriobotrya japonica leaves reduces glucose level in human hepatocellular carcinoma cells, zebrafish and rats.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867526,Scientific reports,2019 03 29,"Type 2 diabetes (T2D) with high morbidity and mortality is characterized by abnormal glucose and lipid metabolism due in part to insulin resistance in liver, which lead to elevated hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia. This study sough to explore the effects of corosolic acid (CA) in different T2D models and explored the underlying mechanism. Separated from Eriobotrya japonica leaves, CA purity was above 95% measured by a HPLC method. Compared with cAMP and DEX induced T2D HepG2 model, CA significantly stimulated glucose consumption and improved glycogen accumulation by inhibiting PEPCK mRNA expression. And in cAMP and DEX induced T2D zebrafish model, CA reduced glycogen degradation and increased glucose consumption by regulating some key enzymes in carbon metabolism including GLUT1, GLUT2, GLUT3, LDHA, LDHB, GP, G6Pase, GYS1, and PFKFB3. In addition, insulin receptor signals were also involved in CA-regulated hypoglycemic action. Furthermore, in STZ-induced T2D rat model, compared with diabetic control groups, CA remarkably downregulated the levels of serum lipid, blood glucose, ICAM-1, malonaldehyde and insulin resistance index, while upregulated SOD activity and impaired glucose tolerance. In a conclusion, CA can regulate glucose and lipid metabolic adaptation in T2D like HepG2, zebrafish and rat models partly through reducing inflammation and oxidative stress and suppressing PEPCK.",Movement-Contingent Time Flow in Virtual Reality Causes Temporal Recalibration.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867525,Scientific reports,2019 03 29,"Virtual reality (VR) provides a valuable research tool for studying what occurs when sensorimotor feedback loops are manipulated. Here we measured whether exposure to a novel temporal relationship between action and sensory reaction in VR causes recalibration of time perception. We asked 31 participants to perform time perception tasks where the interval of a moving probe was reproduced using continuous or discrete motor methods. These time perception tasks were completed pre- and post-exposure to dynamic VR content in a block-counterbalanced order. One group of participants experienced a standard VR task (""normal-time""), while another group had their real-world movements coupled to the flow of time in the virtual space (""movement contingent time-flow; MCTF""). We expected this novel action-perception relationship to affect continuous motor time perception performance, but not discrete motor time perception. The results indicated duration-dependent recalibration specific to a motor task involving continuous movement such that the probe intervals were under-estimated by approximately 15% following exposure to VR with the MCTF manipulation. Control tasks in VR and non-VR settings produced similar results to those of the normal-time VR group, confirming the specificity of the MCTF manipulation. The findings provide valuable insights into the potential impact of VR on sensorimotor recalibration. Understanding this process will be valuable for the development and implementation of rehabilitation practices.",Impact of a bathing tradition on shared gut microbe among Japanese families.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867524,Scientific reports,2019 03 29,"Sharing of Bifidobacterium longum strains had recently been shown to occur among Japanese family members, a phenomenon that is not confined to mother-infant pairs. In the current study, we investigated if bathtub water is a possible vehicle for the exchange of strains as a consequence of a Japanese custom to share bathtub water by family members during bathing practices. A total of twenty-one subjects from five Japanese families, each consisting of parents with either 2 or 3 children, were enrolled in this study and the fecal microbiota of all participants was determined. Viable bifidobacterial strains were isolated from all bathtub water samples. A subsequent comparative genome analysis using ninety-eight strains indicated that certain strain-sets, which were isolated from feces and bathtub water, share near identical genome sequences, including CRISPR/Cas protospacers. By means of unweighted UniFrac distance analysis based on 16S rRNA gene analysis of 59 subjects from sixteen Japanese families, we showed that the fecal microbiota composition among family members that share bathtub water is significantly closer than that between family members that do not engage in this practice. Our results indicate that bathtub water represents a vehicle for the transmission of gut bacteria, and that the Japanese custom of sharing bathtub water contributes to the exchange of gut microbes, in particular bifidobacteria, among family members.",Integrative approach detects natural hybridization of sympatric lambaris species and emergence of infertile hybrids.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867523,Scientific reports,2019 03 29,"Despite its relevance for ecology, evolution and conservation of species, natural hybridization and hybrids biology are still poorly studied in freshwater fish. Here, we tested the hypothesis that sympatric species Astyanax paranae and A. fasciatus are able to interbreed in the natural environment and presented evidence for the first record of hybridization between these species. We analyzed anatomical traits, gametogenesis, reproductive biology, and genetic variations of the COI and S7 genes of both species and putative hybrids. Intermediate morphometric and meristic features were observed in hybrids when compared to A. paranae and A. fasciatus. Overlap in reproductive season was showed for these species, with greater reproductive activity from August to January, but hybrids did not present any sign of gonadal maturation. Oogonia and perinucleolar follicles as well as spermatogonia and primary spermatocytes were found in hybrids, but previtellogenic and vitellogenic follicles, spermatids, and spermatozoa were absent. Moreover, several alterations in gametogenesis were detected, such as interrupted meiosis in both males and females, vacuolated and degenerated germ cells, increased interstitial tissue, and presence of immune cells. Molecular analyses supported the hypothesis of hybridization between A. paranae and A. fasciatus. Overall, our multidisciplinary approach also provides strong evidence that hybrids are infertile.",Upfront Surgery versus Neoadjuvant Therapy for Resectable Pancreatic Cancer: Systematic Review and Bayesian Network Meta-analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867522,Scientific reports,2019 03 29,"Current treatment recommendations for resectable pancreatic cancer support upfront resection and adjuvant therapy. Randomized controlled trials offering comparison with the emerging neoadjuvant approach are lacking. This review aims to compare both treatment strategies for resectable pancreatic cancer.

A Bayesian network meta-analysis was conducted using the Markov chain Monte Carlo method. Cochrane Collaboration's risk of bias, ROBINS-I and GRADE tools were used to assess quality and risk of bias of included trials. 9 studies compared neoadjuvant therapy and surgery-first with adjuvant therapy (n = 22,285). Aggregate rate (AR) of R0 resection for neoadjuvant therapy was 0.8008 (0.3636-0.9144) versus 0.7515 (0.2026-0.8611) odds ratio (O.R.) 1.27 (95% CI 0.60-1.96). 1-year survival AR for neoadjuvant therapy was 0.7969 (0.6061-0.9500) versus 0.7481 (0.4848-0.8500) O.R. 1.38 (95% CI 0.69-2.96). 2-year survival AR for neoadjuvant therapy was 0.5178 (0.3000-0.5970) versus 0.5131 (0.2727-0.5346) O.R. 1.26 (95% CI 0.94-1.74). 5-year AR survival for neoadjuvant therapy was 0.2069 (0.0323-0.3300) versus 0.1783 (0.0606-0.2300) O.R. 1.19 (95% CI 0.65-1.73).

We systematically analysed genomic location of transposable elements (TEs) in 625 publicly available fungal genomes from the NCBI database in order to explore their potential roles in genome evolution and correlation with species' lifestyle. We found that non-autonomous TEs and remnant copies are evenly distributed across genomes. In consequence, they also massively overlap with regions annotated as genes, which suggests a great contribution of TE-derived sequences to host's coding genome. Younger and potentially active TEs cluster with one another away from genic regions. This non-randomness is a sign of either selection against insertion of TEs in gene proximity or target site preference among some types of TEs. Proteins encoded by genes with old transposable elements insertions have significantly less repeat and protein-protein interaction motifs but are richer in enzymatic domains. However, genes only proximal to TEs do not display any functional enrichment. Our findings show that adaptive cases of TE insertion remain a marginal phenomenon, and the overwhelming majority of TEs are evolving neutrally. Eventually, animal-related and pathogenic fungi have more TEs inserted into genes than fungi with other lifestyles. This is the first systematic, kingdom-wide study concerning mobile elements and their genomic neighbourhood. The obtained results should inspire further research concerning the roles TEs played in evolution and how they shape the life we know today."

In this work, poly(styrene-b-2-hydroxyethyl acrylate) called PS-b-PHEA was synthesized by a nitroxide meditated polymerization method. Owing to the use of a specific polystyrene macroinitiator (SG1), a suitable TPE copolymer with long hydroxyethyl acrylate blocks to ensure good mechanical properties is obtained for the first time. We show that the electrochemical properties of the PS-b-PHEA-coated SnSb anode are drastically improved by suppressing the crack formation at the surface of the electrode. Indeed, electrochemical characterization revealed that a high and stable gravimetric capacity over 100 cycles could be achieved. Moreover, excellent capacity reversibility was achieved when cycled at multiple C-rates and fast kinetics confirming the strong protection role of the polymer. The advanced chemical and mechanical properties of PS-b-PHEA open up promising perspectives to significantly improve the electrochemical performance of all electrodes that are known to suffer from large volume variations.",Combined congenic mapping and nuclease-based gene targeting for studying allele-specific effects of Tnfrsf9 within the Idd9.3 autoimmune diabetes locus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867509,Scientific reports,2019 04 26,"Rodent complex trait genetic studies involving a cross between two inbred strains are usually followed by congenic mapping to refine the loci responsible for the phenotype. However, progressing from a chromosomal region to the actual causal gene remains challenging because multiple polymorphic genes are often closely linked. The goal of this study was to develop a strategy that allows candidate gene testing by allele-specific expression without prior knowledge of the credible causal variant. Tnfrsf9 (encoding CD137) is a candidate gene for the Idd9.3 type 1 diabetes (T1D) susceptibility locus in the nonobese diabetic (NOD) mouse model. A C57BL/10Sn (B10)-derived diabetes resistance Idd9.3 congenic region has been shown to enhance accumulation of CD137+ regulatory T cells and serum soluble CD137 in NOD mice. By combining the power of congenic mapping and nuclease-based gene targeting, we established a system where a pair of F1 hybrids expressed either the B10 or NOD Tnfrsf9 allele mimicking coisogenic strains. Using this approach, we demonstrated that the allelic difference in B10 and NOD Tnfrsf9 alone was sufficient to cause differential accumulation of CD137+ regulatory T cells and serum soluble CD137 levels. This strategy can be broadly applied to other rodent genetic mapping studies.",Hexamethylene bisacetamide impairs NK cell-mediated clearance of acute T lymphoblastic leukemia cells and HIV-1-infected T cells that exit viral latency.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867508,Scientific reports,2019 03 29,"The hexamethylene bisacetamide (HMBA) anticancer drug was dismissed due to limited efficacy in leukemic patients but it may re-enter into the clinics in HIV-1 eradication strategies because of its recently disclosed capacity to reactivate latent virus. Here, we investigated the impact of HMBA on the cytotoxicity of natural killer (NK) cells against acute T lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) cells or HIV-1-infected T cells that exit from latency. We show that in T-ALL cells HMBA upmodulated MICB and ULBP2 ligands for the NKG2D activating receptor. In a primary CD4+ T cell-based latency model, HMBA did not reactivate HIV-1, yet enhanced ULBP2 expression on cells harboring virus reactivated by prostratin (PRO). However, HMBA reduced the expression of NKG2D and its DAP10 adaptor in NK cells, hence impairing NKG2D-mediated cytotoxicity and DAP10-dependent response to IL-15 stimulation. Alongside, HMBA dampened killing of T-ALL targets by IL-15-activated NK cells and impaired NK cell-mediated clearance of PRO-reactivated HIV-1+ cells. Overall, our results demonstrate a dominant detrimental effect of HMBA on the NKG2D pathway that crucially controls NK cell-mediated killing of tumors and virus-infected cells, providing one possible explanation for poor clinical outcome in HMBA-treated cancer patients and raising concerns for future therapeutic application of this drug.",Photoacoustic Wavefront Shaping with High Signal to Noise Ratio for Light Focusing Through Scattering Media.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867506,Scientific reports,2019 03 29,"Noninvasive light focusing and imaging through a scattering medium can be achieved by wavefront shaping using the photoacoustic signal as feedback. Unfortunately, the signal to noise ratio (SNR) of the traditional photoacoustic method is very low, which limits the wavefront shaping focusing speed and intensity. In this paper, we propose a completely new photoacoustic-signal-extraction method which combines wavelet denoising and correlation detection. With this method, the SNR of the photoacoustic signal reaches 25.2, 6.5 times higher than that of the unprocessed photoacoustic signal. Moreover, we achieve the simultaneous multipoint focusing, which is crucial for improving the speed of scanning imaging. The superior performance of the proposed method was experimentally demonstrated in extracting and denoising the photoacoustic signals deeply buried in noise, one critical step in in vivo photoacoustic imaging.",Thermodynamic and structural contributions of the 6-thioguanosine residue to helical properties of RNA.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867505,Scientific reports,2019 03 29,"Thionucleotides, especially 4-thiouridine and 6-thioguanosine, are photosensitive molecules that photocrosslink to both proteins and nucleic acids, and this feature is a major reason for their application in various investigations. To get insight into the thermodynamic and structural contributions of 6-thioguanosine to the properties of RNA duplexes a systematic study was performed. In a series of RNA duplexes, selected guanosine residues located in G-C base pairs, mismatches (G-G, G-U, and G-A), or 5' and 3'-dangling ends were replaced with 6-thioguanosine. Generally, the presence of 6-thioguanosine diminishes the thermodynamic stability of RNA duplexes. This effect depends on its position within duplexes and the sequence of adjacent base pairs. However, when placed at a dangling end a 6-thioguanosine residue actually exerts a weak stabilizing effect.

While our understanding of the effect of environmental changes on the survival, growth, and movement of spiny lobsters is growing, the effect on their chemosensory abilities has not yet been investigated. Lobsters rely heavily on chemical cues for many biological and ecological activities, and here we report on the effect of extreme environmental events in temperature (32 °C), salinity (45ppt), and pH (7.65 pH) on social behavior and sheltering preference in P. argus. Under normal conditions, chemical cues from conspecifics are used by spiny lobsters to identify suitable shelter and cues from stone crabs and diseased individuals are used to determine shelters to be avoided. In all altered conditions, lobsters lost the ability to aggregate with conspecifics and avoid stone crabs and diseased conspecifics. Thus, seasonal extreme events, and potentially future climate change conditions, alter the chemosensory-driven behavior of P. argus and may result in decreased survivorship due to impaired shelter selection or other behaviors.",Histone acetylation determines transcription of atypical protein kinases in rat neurons.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867503,Scientific reports,2019 03 29,"It is widely accepted that memory consolidation requires de-novo transcription of memory-related genes. Epigenetic modifications, particularly histone acetylation, may facilitate gene transcription, but their potential molecular targets are poorly characterized. In the current study, we addressed the question of epigenetic control of atypical protein kinases (aPKC) that are critically involved in memory consolidation and maintenance. We examined the patterns of expression of two aPKC genes (Prkci and Prkcz) in rat cultured cortical neurons treated with histone deacetylase inhibitors. Histone hyperacetylation in the promoter region of Prkci gene elicited direct activation of transcriptional machinery, resulting in increased production of PKCλ mRNA. In parallel, histone hyperacetylation in the upstream promoter of Prkcz gene led to appearance of the corresponding PKCζ transcripts that are almost absent in the brain in resting conditions. In contrast, histone hyperacetylation in the downstream promoter of Prkcz gene was accompanied by a decreased expression of the brain-specific PKMζ products. We showed that epigenetically-triggered differential expression of PKMζ and PKCζ mRNA depended on protein synthesis. Summarizing, our results suggest that genes, encoding memory-related aPKC, may represent the molecular targets for epigenetic regulation through posttranslational histone modifications.",Profibrotic epithelial phenotype: a central role for MRTF and TAZ.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867502,Scientific reports,2019 03 29,"Epithelial injury is a key initiator of fibrosis but - in contrast to the previous paradigm - the epithelium in situ does not undergo wide-spread epithelial-mesenchymal/myofibroblast transition (EMT/EMyT). Instead, it assumes a Profibrotic Epithelial Phenotype (PEP) characterized by fibrogenic cytokine production. The transcriptional mechanisms underlying PEP are undefined. As we have shown that two RhoA/cytoskeleton-regulated transcriptional coactivators, Myocardin-related transcription factor (MRTF) and TAZ, are indispensable for EMyT, we asked if they might mediate PEP as well. Here we show that mechanical stress (cyclic stretch) increased the expression of transforming growth factor-β1 (TGFβ1), connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), platelet-derived growth factor and Indian Hedgehog mRNA in LLC-PK1 tubular cells. These responses were mitigated by siRNA-mediated silencing or pharmacological inhibition of MRTF (CCG-1423) or TAZ (verteporfin). RhoA inhibition exerted similar effects. Unilateral ureteral obstruction, a murine model of mechanically-triggered kidney fibrosis, induced tubular RhoA activation along with overexpression/nuclear accumulation of MRTF and TAZ, and increased transcription of the above-mentioned cytokines. Laser capture microdissection revealed TAZ, TGFβ1 and CTGF induction specifically in the tubular epithelium. CCG-1423 suppressed total renal and tubular expression of these proteins. Thus, MRTF regulates epithelial TAZ expression, and both MRTF and TAZ are critical mediators of PEP-related epithelial cytokine production.",Reduced sperm telomere length in individuals with varicocele is associated with reduced genomic integrity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867501,Scientific reports,2019 03 29,"Varicocele, defined as enlarged varicose veins in the scrotum, is the most common identifiable cause of male infertility. There are significant correlations between oxidative stress and varicocele-related infertility due to testicular hyperthermia, which can result in low sperm function. In addition, recent excessive oxidative stress can affect sperm telomere length and integrity of sperm DNA. Therefore, we assessed sperm telomere length as a potential marker of paternal genome integrity and leukocyte telomere length as an internal control (real-time PCR), along with sperm chromatin status (TUNEL and chromomycin A3 assay), and lipid peroxidation (Bodipy probe) in 18 infertile men with grade II or III varicocele, and 20 fertile men. Means of sperm parameters, sperm and leukocyte telomere length were significantly lower, while means of sperm DNA fragmentation, protamine deficiency, and lipid peroxidation were significantly higher in infertile men with varicocele compared to fertile men. Therefore, shortened telomere length in sperm and leukocytes is likely associated with increased oxidative stress related to the state of varicocele, which also accounts for increase in sperm DNA fragmentation. Thus, assessment of leukocyte telomere length could be taken as an indicator of antioxidant capacity in an individual, which also affects sperm function.",Adhesive protein-mediated cross-talk between Candida albicans and Porphyromonas gingivalis in dual species biofilm protects the anaerobic bacterium in unfavorable oxic environment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867500,Scientific reports,2019 03 29,"The oral cavity contains different types of microbial species that colonize human host via extensive cell-to-cell interactions and biofilm formation. Candida albicans-a yeast-like fungus that inhabits mucosal surfaces-is also a significant colonizer of subgingival sites in patients with chronic periodontitis. It is notable however that one of the main infectious agents that causes periodontal disease is an anaerobic bacterium-Porphyromonas gingivalis. In our study, we evaluated the different strategies of both pathogens in the mutual colonization of an artificial surface and confirmed that a protective environment existed for P. gingivalis within developed fungal biofilm formed under oxic conditions where fungal cells grow mainly in their filamentous form i.e. hyphae. A direct physical contact between fungi and P. gingivalis was initiated via a modulation of gene expression for the major fungal cell surface adhesin Als3 and the aspartic proteases Sap6 and Sap9. Proteomic identification of the fungal surfaceome suggested also an involvement of the Mp65 adhesin and a ""moonlighting"" protein, enolase, as partners for the interaction with P. gingivalis. Using mutant strains of these bacteria that are defective in the production of the gingipains-the proteolytic enzymes that also harbor hemagglutinin domains-significant roles of these proteins in the formation of bacteria-protecting biofilm were clearly demonstrated."

Here, we investigate the role of the gut microbiome and TGR5 bile acid receptors in MDMA-mediated hyperthermia. Fourteen days prior to treatment with MDMA, male Sprague-Dawley rats were provided water or water treated with antibiotics. Animals that had received antibiotics displayed a reduction in gut bacteria and an attenuated hyperthermic response to MDMA. MDMA treated animals showed increased uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) and TGR5 expression levels in brown adipose tissue and skeletal muscle while increased expression of UCP3 was observed only in skeletal muscle. Antibiotics prior to MDMA administration significantly blunted these increases in gene expression. Furthermore, inhibition of the TGR5 receptor with triamterene or of deiodinase II downstream of the TGR5 receptor with iopanoic acid also resulted in the attenuation of MDMA-induced hyperthermia. MDMA-treatment enriched the relative proportion of a Proteus mirabilis strain in the ceca of animals not pre-treated with antibiotics. These findings suggest a contributing role for the gut microbiota in MDMA-mediated hyperthermia and that MDMA treatment can trigger a rapid remodeling of the composition of the gut microbiome.",Conditional knockout of UBC13 produces disturbances in gait and spontaneous locomotion and exploration in mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867488,Scientific reports,2019 03 29,"Here we have characterized the functional impairments resulting from conditional knockout of the ubiquitin-conjugating E2 enzyme (UBC13) in rodent cerebellar granule neurons, which greatly increases the parallel fiber presynaptic boutons and functional parallel fiber/Purkinje cell synapses. We report that conditional UBC13 knockout mice exhibit reliable deficits on several gait-related variables when their velocity of ambulation is tightly controlled by a moving treadmill and by restricting space for movement. Selected gait parameters and movement patterns related to spontaneous exploration in an open field may also be affected in conditional UBC13 knockout mice. Analysis of open-field data as a function of test session half using force-plate actometer instrumentation suggest that conditional UBC13 knockout mice have alterations in emotionality, possibly affecting gait and movement variables. These findings suggest that conditional UBC13 knockout mice represent a valuable platform for assessing the effects of disturbances in cerebellar granule cell circuitry on gait and other aspects of locomotion. Also, the possibility that psychological factors such as altered emotionality may impact gait and movement patterns in these mice suggest that these mice may provide a useful model for evaluating analogous behavioral impairments in autism spectrum disorders and other neurodevelopmental syndromes associated with deregulation of ubiquitin signaling.",Adverse effects of routine bovine health treatments containing triclabendazole and synthetic pyrethroids on the abundance of dipteran larvae in bovine faeces.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867487,Scientific reports,2019 03 29,"Macrocyclic lactone treatments for livestock can have detrimental effects on the arthropod populations in livestock faeces. For the last twenty years, avoidance of these products has been a standard recommendation on livestock farms that are managed for wildlife by the Royal Society for Protection of Birds (RSPB). However, the continued decline in the populations of birds (in particular the red-billed chough Pyrrhocorax pyrrhocorax) that are dependent on dung invertebrates on islands in the Inner Hebrides of Scotland prompted us to investigate the effects of livestock treatments that are commonly used on these islands. We conducted a replicated field plot study over two years to quantify the effects of livestock treatments containing copper, deltamethrin and triclabendazole on invertebrate density in pooled, artificial faecal pats on the island of Islay. We found that the density of arthropod larvae was significantly reduced by the triclabendazole and deltamethrin treatments in both years and by as much as 86% when the treatments were combined. Copper-containing boluses did not consistently affect abundance of arthropod larvae. These results suggest that veterinary treatment of livestock might contribute to a reduction in the food supply of chough.",Quantitative proteomic changes in LPS-activated monocyte-derived dendritic cells: A SWATH-MS study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867486,Scientific reports,2019 03 29,"Dendritic cells are key immune cells that respond to pathogens and co-ordinate many innate and adaptive immune responses. Quantitative mass spectrometry using Sequential Window Acquisition of all THeoretical fragment-ion spectra-Mass Spectrometry (SWATH-MS) was performed here to determine the global alterations in monocyte-derived dendritic cells (moDCs) in response to stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). A moDC library of 4,666 proteins was generated and proteins were quantified at 0, 6 and 24 h post-LPS stimulation using SWATH-MS. At 6 h and 24 h post-LPS exposure, the relative abundance of 227 and 282 proteins was statistically significantly altered (p-value ≤ 0.05), respectively. Functional annotation of proteins exhibiting significant changes in expression between the various time points led to the identification of clusters of proteins implicated in distinct cellular processes including interferon and interleukin signalling, endocytosis, the ER-phagosome pathway and antigen-presentation. In SWATH-MS major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I proteins were highly upregulated at 24 h, whilst MHC class II proteins exhibited comparatively fewer changes over this period. This study provides new detailed insight into the global proteomic changes that occur in moDCs during antigen processing and presentation and further demonstrates the potential of SWATH-MS for the quantitative study of proteins involved in cellular processes.",Low-dose pioglitazone can ameliorate learning and memory impairment in a mouse model of dementia by increasing LRP1 expression in the hippocampus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867485,Scientific reports,2019 03 29,"Amyloid-β (Aβ) accumulation in the brain is a pathological feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and enhancing Aβ clearance is a potential therapeutic strategy. Pioglitazone is a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPAR-γ) agonist and is widely used to treat type 2 diabetes. We previously reported that low-dose pioglitazone increased the expression of low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1), which upregulates the clearance of Aβ, using human brain microvascular endothelial cells. We investigated whether low-dose pioglitazone can rescue the pathological phenotype and memory impairment in senescence-accelerated mouse prone-8 (SAMP8) mice by increasing LRP1 levels. SAMP8 mice were treated with vehicle or pioglitazone in dosages of 2 or 5 mg/kg/day for 7 weeks. In the water maze test, 2 mg/kg/day of pioglitazone significantly attenuated the increased escape latency in SAMP8 mice (p = 0.026), while 5 mg/kg/day of treatment did not. Compared with vehicle treatment, the hippocampi of SAMP8 mice with 2 mg/kg/day of pioglitazone exhibited fewer Aβ deposits and reduced Aβ1-40 levels, along with elevated LRP1 expression (p = 0.005). Collectively, our results proposed that a new therapeutic application of the PPAR-γ agonist for AD treatment should be considered at a lower dose than the conventional dose used to treat diabetes.",Growth of Plasma-Treated Corn Seeds under Realistic Conditions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867484,Scientific reports,2019 03 29,"In this study, the effect of the plasma treatment on corn seeds is investigated. Corn seeds were treated uniformly without burning or blackening by three kinds of plasma apparatus: RF plasma in vacuum, microwave-driven atmospheric-pressure plasma, DBD atmospheric-pressure plasma, and two other treatments: vacuum exposure only, and using plasma-activated water in the seed coating process, to investigate growth rate changes under realistic conditions. Each treatment was performed on a total of 1512 corn seeds. Seeds from each experimental condition were treated with the recommended rate of Poncho/VOTiVO with Acceleron, a commercial biological seed treatment that helps to protect the seeds from fungus, insects, and nematodes after planting. The 1512 seeds were divided evenly into three replications with 84 seeds planted for each replication at six unique locations across central Illinois. The results for germination, growth, and product yield over the 2017 growing season is presented. Overall no statistically significant difference in the yield of corn harvested was found between the control and any of the five treatments. This is likely due to the already near-100% germination rate of the corn hybrid used in the study and the use of the Poncho/VOTiVO protective coating on every sample.",Tsunamigenic potential of crustal faults and subduction zones in the Mediterranean.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867483,Scientific reports,2019 03 29,"We compiled a database and systematically evaluated tsunamigenic potential of all up-to-date known crustal fault systems and subduction zones in the entire Mediterranean region that has experienced several catastrophic tsunamis in historical times. The task is accomplished by means of numerical modeling of tsunami generation and propagation. We have systematically simulated all representative ruptures populating known crustal faults and subduction interfaces with magnitudes ranging from 6.1 up to expected Mwmax. Maximum tsunami heights calculated everywhere along the coasts allowed us to classify the sources in terms of their tsunamigenic potential and to estimate their minimum tsunamigenic magnitude. Almost every source in the Mediterranean, starting from Mw = 6.5, is capable to produce local tsunami at the advisory level (wave height >20 cm and ≤50 cm). In respect to the watch level (wave height >50 cm) larger magnitudes are needed (Mw ≥ 6.9). Faults behave more heterogeneously in the context of far field early warning. De-aggregation of the database at any selected coastal location can reveal relevant sources of tsunami hazard for this location. Our compilation blueprints methodology that, if completed with source recurrence rates and site-specific amplification factors, can be considered as a backbone for development of optimal early warning strategies by Mediterranean tsunami warning providers.","Rg6, a rare ginsenoside, inhibits systemic inflammation through the induction of interleukin-10 and microRNA-146a.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867482,Scientific reports,2019 03 29,"The immunobiological functions of Rg6, a rare ginsenoside from ginseng, have been largely unreported. In this paper, we demonstrate that Rg6 has a significant immunosuppressive function on Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4-induced systemic inflammatory responses. Rg6 was found to negatively regulate pro-inflammatory responses and severity in vivo, and thus induced recovery in mice with lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced septic shock and cecal ligation and puncture (CLP)-induced sepsis. Rg6 treatment also facilitated recovery in mice with LPS-induced lung damage via reduced neutrophil infiltration and tumor necrosis factor-α expression in lung tissues. Rg6 injection also downregulated pro-inflammatory cytokines and increased the levels of interleukin (IL)-10 in the serum of septic mice. Mechanistically, Rg6 did not induce TLR negative regulators, such as A20 and IRAK-M, in bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs). Instead, addition of Rg6 to LPS-activated BMDMs augmented IL-10 expression, whereas it inhibited inflammatory signaling, such as by nuclear factor κB activation and mitogen-activated protein kinases. Furthermore, Rg6 significantly induced miR-146a, an operator miRNA for anti-inflammation, in BMDMs. Collectively, these data indicate that Rg6 inhibits inflammatory responses through the induction of IL-10 and miR-146a.",Meta-analysis suggests evidence of novel stress-related pathway components in Orsay virus - Caenorhabditis elegans viral model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867481,Scientific reports,2019 03 29,"The genetic model organism, Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans), shares many genes with humans and is the best-annotated of the eukaryotic genome. Therefore, the identification of new genes and pathways is unlikely. Nevertheless, host-pathogen interaction studies from viruses, recently discovered in the environment, has created new opportunity to discover these pathways. For example, the exogenous RNAi response in C. elegans by the Orsay virus as seen in plants and other eukaryotes is not systemic and transgenerational, suggesting different RNAi pathways between these organisms. Using a bioinformatics meta-analysis approach, we show that the top 17 genes differentially-expressed during C. elegans infection by Orsay virus are functionally uncharacterized genes. Furthermore, functional annotation using similarity search and comparative modeling, was able to predict folds correctly, but could not assign easily function to the majority. However, we could identify gene expression studies that showed a similar pattern of gene expression related to toxicity, stress and immune response. Those results were strengthened using protein-protein interaction network analysis. This study shows that novel molecular pathway components, of viral innate immune response, can be identified and provides models that can be further used as a framework for experimental studies. Whether these features are reminiscent of an ancient mechanism evolutionarily conserved, or part of a novel pathway, remain to be established. These results reaffirm the tremendous value of this approach to broaden our understanding of viral immunity in C. elegans.",A comparison study of radiation effective dose in ECG-Gated Coronary CT Angiography and calcium scoring examinations performed with a dual-source CT scanner.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867480,Scientific reports,2019 03 29,"In this report we have evaluated radiation effective dose received by patients during ECG-gated CCTA examinations based on gender, heart rate, tube voltage protocol and body mass index (BMI). A total of 1,824 patients were retrospectively recruited (1,139 men and 685 women) and they were divided into Group 1 (CCTA with calcium scoring), Group 2 (CCTA without calcium scoring) and Group 3 (only calcium scoring), where the association between gender, heart rate, tube voltage protocol and body mass index (BMI) were analysed. Examinations were performed using a retrospective ECG-gated CCTA protocol and the effective doses were calculated from the dose length product with a conversion coefficient of 0.026 mSv.mGy-1cm-1. No significant differences were observed in the mean effective dose between gender in all groups. The mean estimated dose was significantly higher when the heart rate was lower in Group 1 (p < 0.001) and Group 2 (p = 0.002). There were also significant differences between the mean effective dose in tube voltage protocol and BMI among the three groups. The mean effective dose was positively correlated with BMI (p < 0.001), but inversely related to the heart rate. This study supported the theory that a high heart rate, low tube voltage and low BMI could significantly reduce radiation dose exposure."

Recently, copy number variants (CNVs) in the STRC gene have also been recognized as a major cause of genetic hearing loss. We investigated the frequency of STRC deletions in the Japanese population and the characteristics of associated hearing loss. For CNV analysis, we employed a specialized method of Ion AmpliSeqTM sequencing, and confirmed the CNV results via custom array comparative genomic hybridization. We identified 17 probands with STRC homozygous deletions. The prevalence of STRC homozygous deletions was 1.7% in the hearing loss population overall, and 4.3% among mild-to-moderate hearing loss patients. A 2.63% carrier deletion rate was identified in both the hearing loss and the control population with normal hearing. In conclusion, our results show that STRC deletions are the second most common cause of mild-to-moderate hearing loss after the GJB2 gene, which accounts for the majority of genetic hearing loss. The phenotype of hearing loss is congenital and appears to be moderate, and is most likely to be stable without deterioration even after the age of 50. The present study highlights the importance of the STRC gene as a major cause of mild-to-moderate hearing loss.",Ectopic expression of a bacterial mercury transporter MerC in root epidermis for efficient mercury accumulation in shoots of Arabidopsis plants.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867467,Scientific reports,2019 03 29,"For mercury phytoextraction, we previously demonstrated in Arabidopsis thaliana that a constitutive and ubiquitous promoter-driven expression of a bacterial mercury transporter MerC fused with SYP121, a plant SNARE for plasma membrane protein trafficking increases plant mercury accumulation. To advance regulation of ectopic expression of the bacterial transporter in the plant system, the present study examined whether merC-SYP121 expression driven by a root epidermis specific promoter (pEpi) is sufficient to enhance mercury accumulation in plant tissues. We generated five independent transgenic Arabidopsis plant lines (hereafter pEpi lines) expressing a transgene encoding MerC-SYP121 N-terminally tagged with a fluorescent protein mTRQ2 under the control of pEpi, a root epidermal promoter. Confocal microscopy analysis of the pEpi lines showed that mTRQ2-MerC-SYP121 was preferentially expressed in lateral root cap in the root meristematic zone and epidermal cells in the elongation zone of the roots. Mercury accumulation in shoots of the pEpi lines exposed to inorganic mercury was overall higher than the wild-type and comparable to the over-expressing line. The results suggest that cell-type specific expression of the bacterial transporter MerC in plant roots sufficiently enhances mercury accumulation in shoots, which could be a useful phenotype for improving efficiency of mercury phytoremediation.","A Nationwide, Population-based Cohort Study on Potential Autoimmune Association of Ménière Disease to Atopy and Vitiligo.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867466,Scientific reports,2019 03 29,"Ménière disease (MD), an idiopathic disorder of sensorineural hearing loss and vertigo, shares many similarities with two common skin conditions, atopic dermatitis (AD) and vitiligo. Recent studies have suggested that MD may be related to or triggered by autoimmune conditions, notably Hashimoto thyroiditis and alopecia areata. These evidences led to the authors contemplating the possibility of immunological bridge between MD and the two skin conditions. The authors have tested this hypothesis with population-based cohort from the National Health Insurance Service Database of Korea. A cohort of 1.1 million patients was extracted from the database. Using χ2 tests, prevalence of the two skin disorders in relation to MD status was analysed. In MD patients, the odds ratios for having concurrent AD and vitiligo were 0.717 (95% CI, 0.535-0.962, p = 0.026) and 2.149 (95% CI, 1.396-3.308, p = 0.001), respectively. Females and older patients were more than twice likely to be affected by the two skin conditions. The relationship between vitiligo and MD was significant in younger subgroup only. Socio-economic subgroup analysis revealed the observed patterns are primarily a middle-upper class phenomenon. Uncertainty regarding temporal sequence of onset, and lack of detail on disease severity and subtype kept the study from more refined conclusion. In concluding, AD and vitiligo might be linked to MD through Treg-driven action of cellular immunity, but further big data-based investigations must follow.",Robust optomechanical state transfer under composite phase driving.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867465,Scientific reports,2019 03 29,"We propose a technique for robust optomechanical state transfer using phase-tailored composite pulse driving with constant amplitude. Our proposal is inspired by coherent control techniques in lossless driven qubits. We demonstrate that there exist optimal phases for maximally robust excitation exchange in lossy strongly-driven optomechanical state transfer. In addition, our proposed composite phase driving also protects against random variations in the parameters of the system. However, this driving can take the system out of its steady state. For this reason, we use the ideal optimal phases to produce smooth sequences that both maintain the system close to its steady state and optimize the robustness of optomechanical state transfer.",Learning Unicycling Evokes Manifold Changes in Gray and White Matter Networks Related to Motor and Cognitive Functions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867464,Scientific reports,2019 03 29,"A three-week unicycling training was associated with (1) reductions of gray matter volume in regions closely linked to visuospatial processes such as spatial awareness, (2) increases in fractional anisotropy primarily in the right corticospinal tract and in the right forceps major of the corpus callosum, and (3) a slowly evolving increase in cortical thickness in the left motor cortex. Intriguingly, five weeks later, during which participants were no longer regularly engaged in unicycling, a re-increase in gray matter was found in the very same region of the rSTG. These changes in gray and white matter morphology were paralleled by increases in unicycling performance, and by improvements in postural control, which diminished until the follow-up assessments. Learning to ride a unicycle results in reorganization of different types of brain tissue facilitating more automated postural control, clearly demonstrating that learning a complex balance task modulates brain structure in manifold and highly dynamic ways.",Growth in syphilis-exposed and -unexposed uninfected children from birth to 18 months of age in China: a longitudinal study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867463,Scientific reports,2019 03 29,"Early infant growth and development has attracted worldwide attention. Although numerous studies have demonstrated that maternal syphilis increases the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes and congenital syphilis, the subsequent growth pattern and morbidity of syphilis-exposed uninfected infants are less understood. We conducted a longitudinal study to compare the growth pattern and disease distribution of syphilis-exposed and syphilis-unexposed uninfected children, and World Health Organization (WHO) reference standards from birth to 18 months of age. We obtained data from a prospective cohort study in three representative regions of Zhejiang Province in China. A total of 333 syphilis-uninfected children born to women with syphilis were recruited at birth and matched with 333 syphilis-uninfected children born to women without syphilis during pregnancy. Children were followed-up by medical staff every 3 months until 18 months of age. The mixed-effects model was used to compare changes in growth patterns and influencing factors between the two groups. Mean weight, length, and head circumference of children, as well as disease prevalence, were similar between the groups. Multilevel analysis indicated that, after controlling confounders, growth velocities were comparable in both weight and length measures from birth to 18 months old between the two groups; however, low birth weight had a negative impact on weight gain in both groups. There was no significant negative association between syphilis exposure and early growth and health in children, under 18 months in a setting with universal coverage of therapeutic interventions for maternal syphilis. These findings may contribute to improving prevention efforts for mother-to-child transmission of syphilis, such as early screening for syphilis in pregnant women, universal coverage of treatment, and interventions for exposed children. Children with low birth weight should be given priority as this is a risk factor for weight gain.",B1.12: a novel peptide interacting with the extracellular loop of the EBV oncoprotein LMP1.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867462,Scientific reports,2019 03 29,"Latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) encoded by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) plays an important role in EBV-induced cell transformation.

In this study, we identified by Phage display a novel peptide called B1.12 (ACPLDLRSPCG) which selectively binds to the extracellular loop (B1) of the LMP1 oncoprotein as demonstrated by molecular docking, NMR and ITC. Using an LMP1 expressing cell line, we showed that B1.12 decreased cell viability, and induced G0/G1 cell cycle arrest. In addition, the expression of A20, pAkt, and pNFkb (pRelA536) in C666-1 cells treated with B1.12 decreased compared to the untreated cells. In conclusion, we selected a novel peptide able to bind specifically to the extracellular loop of LMP1 and thus modulate its oncogenic properties.",Crystal structures of thiamine monophosphate kinase from Acinetobacter baumannii in complex with substrates and products.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867460,Scientific reports,2019 03 29,"Thiamine monophosphate kinase (ThiL) catalyzes the last step of thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) synthesis, the ATP-dependent phosphorylation of thiamine monophosphate (TMP) to thiamine pyrophosphate. We solved the structure of ThiL from the human pathogen A. baumanii in complex with a pair of substrates TMP and a non-hydrolyzable adenosine triphosphate analog, and in complex with a pair of products TPP and adenosine diphosphate. High resolution of the data and anomalous diffraction allows for a detailed description of the binding mode of substrates and products, and their metal environment. The structures further support a previously proposed in-line attack reaction mechanism and show a distinct variability of metal content of the active site.",Community-Based Event Detection in Temporal Networks.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867459,Scientific reports,2019 03 29,"We propose a method for detecting large events based on the structure of temporal communication networks. Our method is motivated by findings that viral information spreading has distinct diffusion patterns with respect to community structure. Namely, we hypothesize that global events trigger viral information cascades that easily cross community boundaries and can thus be detected by monitoring intra- and inter-community communications. By comparing the amount of communication within and across communities, we show that it is possible to detect events, even when they do not trigger a significantly larger communication volume. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method using two examples-the email communication network of Enron and the Twitter communication network during the Boston Marathon bombing.","Metabolic syndrome alters relationships between cardiometabolic variables, cognition and white matter hyperintensity load.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867458,Scientific reports,2019 03 29,"Cardiometabolic risk factors influence white matter hyperintensity (WMH) development: in metabolic syndrome (MetS), higher WMH load is often reported but the relationships between specific cardiometabolic variables, WMH load and cognitive performance are uncertain. We investigated these in a Brazilian sample (aged 50-85) with (N = 61) and without (N = 103) MetS. Stepwise regression models identified effects of cardiometabolic and demographic variables on WMH load (from FLAIR MRI) and verbal recall performance. WMH volume was greater in MetS, but verbal recall performance was not impaired. Age showed the strongest relationship with WMH load. Across all participants, systolic blood pressure (SBP) and fasting blood glucose were also contributors, and WMH volume was negatively associated with verbal recall performance. In non-MetS, higher HbA1c, SBP, and number of MetS components were linked to poorer recall performance while higher triglyceride levels appeared to be protective. In MetS only, these relationships were absent but education exerted a strongly protective effect on recall performance. Thus, results support MetS as a construct: the clustering of cardiometabolic variables in MetS alters their individual relationships with cognition; instead, MetS is characterised by a greater reliance on cognitive reserve mechanisms. In non-MetS, strategies to control HbA1c and SBP should be prioritised as these have the largest impact on cognition."

In this study, a hydrogen-free high-density energetic 3,4-bis(3-nitrofuroxan-4-yl)furoxan (BNTFO-I) was designed and synthesized in a simple, and straightforward manner. Its isomer, 3,4-bis(4-nitrofuroxan-3-yl)furoxan (BNTFO-IV), was also obtained by isomerization. The structures of BNTFO-I and BNTFO-IV were confirmed by single-crystal X-ray analysis for the first time. Surprisingly, BNTFO-I has a remarkable calculated crystal density of 1983 g cm-3 at 296 K, which is distinctly higher than BNTFO-IV (1.936 g cm-3, 296 K), and ranks highest among azole-based CNO compounds yet reported. It is noteworthy that BNTFO-I exhibits excellent calculated detonation properties (vD, 9867 m s-1, P, 45.0 GPa). The interesting configuration differences of BNTFO-I and BNTFO-IV provide insight into the design of new advanced energetic materials.",Crystal structures of multidrug efflux pump MexB bound with high-molecular-mass compounds.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867446,Scientific reports,2019 03 29,"RND-type multidrug efflux pumps have two voluminous multisite drug-binding pockets named the proximal and distal binding pocket. High- and low-molecular-mass drugs bind to these proximal and distal pocket, respectively. Here, we report the crystal structures of MexB of Pseudomonas aeruginosa bound with high-molecular-mass compounds. Contrary to the expectations, lauryl maltose neopentyl glycol (LMNG, MW 1,005), which is a surfactant larger than the proximal pocket-binding drugs, was found to bind to the distal pocket: one of the two hydrophobic alkyl chains was inserted into the hydrophobic pit, which is the binding site of the efflux pump inhibitor ABI-PP. LMNG is a substrate of the MexAB-OprM system and competitively inhibits the export of other substrates by this system. However, LMNG does not inhibit the export of other substrates by the inhibitor-binding-pit mutant F178W, which retains the export activity of LMNG. The crystal structure of this mutant suggested that the alkyl chain of LMNG could no longer be inserted into the pit because of steric hindrance. We also determined the crystal structure of MexB containing the high-molecular-mass compound neopentyl glycol derivative C7NG (MW 1,028), the binding site of which overlapped with LMNG in the distal pocket, indicating that whether a substrate binds to the distal or proximal pockets is controlled not only by its molecular weight but also by its individual molecular characteristic.",DNA damage signalling from the placenta to foetal blood as a potential mechanism for childhood leukaemia initiation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867444,Scientific reports,2019 03 29,"For many diseases with a foetal origin, the cause for the disease initiation remains unknown. Common childhood acute leukaemia is thought to be caused by two hits, the first in utero and the second in childhood in response to infection. The mechanism for the initial DNA damaging event are unknown. Here we have used in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo models to show that a placental barrier will respond to agents that are suspected of initiating childhood leukaemia by releasing factors that cause DNA damage in cord blood and bone marrow cells, including stem cells. We show that DNA damage caused by in utero exposure can reappear postnatally after an immune challenge. Furthermore, both foetal and postnatal DNA damage are prevented by prenatal exposure of the placenta to a mitochondrially-targeted antioxidant. We conclude that the placenta might contribute to the first hit towards leukaemia initiation by bystander-like signalling to foetal haematopoietic cells.","The complexity of tumor shape, spiculatedness, correlates with tumor radiomic shape features.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867443,Scientific reports,2019 03 29,"Radiomics extracts high-throughput quantitative data from medical images to contribute to precision medicine. Radiomic shape features have been shown to correlate with patient outcomes. However, how radiomic shape features vary in function of tumor complexity and tumor volume, as well as with method used for meshing and voxel resampling, remains unknown. The aims of this study are to create tumor models with varying degrees of complexity, or spiculatedness, and evaluate their relationship with quantitatively extracted shape features. Twenty-eight tumor models were mathematically created using spherical harmonics with the spiculatedness degree d being increased by increments of 3 (d = 11 to d = 92). Models were 3D printed with identical bases of 5 cm, imaged with a CT scanner with two different slice thicknesses, and semi-automatically delineated. Resampling of the resulting masks on a 1 × 1 × 1 mm3 grid was performed, and the voxel size of each model was then calculated to eliminate volume differences. Four MATLAB-based algorithms (isosurface (M1), isosurface filter (M2), isosurface remeshing (M3), and boundary (M4)) were used to extract nine 3D features (Volume, Surface area, Surface-to-volume, Compactness1, Compactness2, Compactness3, Spherical Disproportion, Sphericity and Fractional Concavity). To quantify the impact of 3D printing, acquisition, segmentation and meshing, features were computed directly from the stereolithography (STL) file format that was used for 3D printing, and compared to those computed. Changes in feature values between 0.6 and 2 mm slice acquisitions were also compared. Spearman's rank-order correlation coefficients were computed to determine the relationship of each shape feature with spiculatedness for each of the four meshing algorithms. Percent changes were calculated between shape features extracted from the original and resampled contoured images to evaluate the influence of spatial resampling. Finally, the percent change in shape features when the volume was changed from 25% to 150% of their original volume was quantified for three distinct tumor models and compared to the percent change observed when modifying the spiculatedness of the model from d = 11 to d = 92. Values extracted using isosurface remeshing method are the closest to the STL reference ones, with mean differences less than 10.8% (Compactness2) for all features. Seven of the eight features had strong significant correlations with tumor model complexity irrespective of the meshing algorithm (r > 0.98, p < 10-4), with fractional concavity having the lowest correlation coefficient (r = 0.83, p < 10-4, M2). Comparisons of features extracted from the 0.6 and 2 mm slice thicknesses showed that mean differences were from 2.1% (Compactness3) to 12.7% (Compactness2) for the isosurface remeshing method. Resampling on a 1 × 1 × 1 mm3 grid resulted in between 1.3% (Compactness3) to 9.5% (Fractional Concavity) mean changes in feature values. Compactness2, Compactness3, Spherical Disproportion, Sphericity and Fractional Concavity were the features least affected by volume changes. Compactness1 had a 90.4% change with volume, which was greater than the change between the least and most spiculated models. This is the first methodological study that directly demonstrates the relationship of tumor spiculatedness with radiomic shape features, that also produced 3D tumor models, which may serve as reference phantoms for future radiomic studies. Surface Area, Surface-to-volume, and Spherical Disproportion had direct relationships with spiculatedness while the three formulas for Compactness, Sphericity and Fractional Concavity had inverse relationships. The features Compactness2, Compactness3, Spherical Disproportion, and Sphericity should be prioritized as these have minimal variations with volume changes, slice thickness and resampling.",Matrix effect on surface-catalyzed photolysis of nitric acid.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867442,Scientific reports,2019 03 29,"Photolysis rate constant of HNO3 on the surface (HNO3(s)) has been found to be enhanced by 1-4 orders of magnitude from that of gaseous HNO3, with HONO and NO2 as the main products. Such Re-NOx-ification pathway extends the apparent lifetime of reactive nitrogen species and modifies the atmospheric oxidative capacity along its long-rang transport. Despite of its importance, the detailed kinetics and mechanisms of HNO3(s) photolysis are still not clear. Surface film of HNO3 and organic compounds is ubiquitous in the environment and imposes matrix effect on HNO3(s) photolysis. Here we studied photolysis of HNO3 on Pyrex glass in a photochemical flow reactor over a wide range of HNO3 surface density (DHNO3) with or without the presence of model organic compounds. The photolysis rate constant of HNO3(s) varied with DHNO3 and surface-catalysis mechanism was proposed. Organic compounds further enhance the photolysis rate constant by up to one order of magnitude via both photosensitization and H-donating reaction. The H-donating reaction enhances as well the secondary HONO yield from reaction between the primary product NO2 and adjacent H-donor, and thus increases the HONO/NO2 production ratio. Finally, detailed mechanisms involving surface-catalyisis, photosensitization and H-donating reactions was integrated.",Small-molecule inhibitor of HlyU attenuates virulence of Vibrio species.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867441,Scientific reports,2019 03 29,"Increasing antibiotic resistance has led to the development of new strategies to combat bacterial infection. Anti-virulence strategies that impair virulence of bacterial pathogens are one of the novel approaches with less selective pressure for developing resistance than traditional strategies that impede viability. In this study, a small molecule CM14 [N-(4-oxo-4H-thieno[3,4-c]chromen-3-yl)-3-phenylprop-2-ynamide] that inhibits the activity of HlyU, a transcriptional regulator essential for the virulence of the fulminating human pathogen Vibrio vulnificus, has been identified. Without affecting bacterial growth or triggering the host cell death, CM14 reduces HlyU-dependent expression of virulence genes in V. vulnificus. In addition to the decreased hemolysis of human erythrocytes, CM14 impedes host cell rounding and lysis caused by V. vulnificus. Notably, CM14 significantly enhances survival of mice infected with V. vulnificus by alleviating hepatic and renal dysfunction and systemic inflammation. Biochemical, mass spectrometric, and mutational analyses revealed that CM14 inhibits HlyU from binding to target DNA by covalently modifying Cys30. Remarkably, CM14 decreases the expression of various virulence genes of other Vibrio species and thus attenuates their virulence phenotypes. Together, this molecule could be an anti-virulence agent against HlyU-harboring Vibrio species with a low selective pressure for the emergence of resistance.",Effects of Black Raspberries and Their Ellagic Acid and Anthocyanin Constituents on Taxane Chemotherapy of Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867440,Scientific reports,2019 03 29,"Cancer patients often use dietary supplements while on therapy, but little is known about interactions of supplements with cancer chemotherapy. Black raspberries (BRB) have anti-cancer effects, but have not been evaluated for interference with chemotherapy for castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Here we studied whether BRB and some of their constituents interact with docetaxel and cabazitaxel on CRPC cells in culture and implanted into nude mice. Ellagic acid increased, but BRB extract inhibited, microtubule assembly. Ellagic acid decreased tubulin polymerization by cabazitaxel and bound to tubulin. Ellagic acid, its metabolite urolithin A, BRB extract, and the anthocyanin metabolite protocatechuic acid (PCA) did not alter cytotoxicity of taxanes. Ellagic acid inhibited drug efflux in CRPC cells, but BRB extract and PCA did not. None of these compounds altered CYP3A4 activity. Although dietary ellagic acid did not alter the tumor growth inhibition by docetaxel of xenografted 22Rv1 cells, ellagic acid has the potential to interfere with taxane chemotherapy by reducing tubulin polymerization while inhibiting P-glycoprotein drug efflux. These data are cause for concern of consuming ellagic acid during treatment for CRPC and indicate need for further research, but BRB consumption appears safe.",A core-scale reconstructing method for shale.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867439,Scientific reports,2019 03 29,"Characterization of shale cores with low and anisotropic permeability is complicated, due to the presence of multiscale pore structure and thin layers, and defies conventional methods. To accurately reproduce the morphology of multiscale pore structure of the shale core, a novel core-scale reconstructing method is proposed to reconstruct 3D digital-experimental models by means of the combination of SEM, EDS images, nitrogen adsorption and pressure pulse decay experiment result. In this method, the multiscale and multicomponent reconstructing algorithm is introduced to build the representative multiscale model for each layer, which can describe the complex 3D structures of nano organic pores, micro-nano inorganic pores, micro slits and several typical minerals. Especially, to reproduce the realistic morphology for shale, the optimization algorithm based on simulated annealing algorithm uses the experimental data as constrain conditions to adjust and optimize the model for each layer. To describe the bedding characteristics of the shale core, bedding fractures are constructed by analysis of the mineral distribution in the interface of two layers, and then the representative models for different layers are integrated together to obtain the final core-scale digital-experimental model. Finally, the model is validated by computing its morphological and flow properties and comparing them with those of the actual 3D shale sample. This method provide a way for systematically and continuously describe the multiscale and anisotropic pore structure (from nm-cm) of the shale core, and will be helpful for understanding the quality of the shale reservoir.",The immunosuppressant drug azathioprine restrains adipogenesis of muscle Fibro/Adipogenic Progenitors from dystrophic mice by affecting AKT signaling.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867438,Scientific reports,2019 03 29,"Fibro/Adipogenic Progenitors (FAPs) define a stem cell population playing a pro-regenerative role after muscle damage. When removed from their natural niche, FAPs readily differentiate into adipocytes or fibroblasts. This digressive differentiation potential, which is kept under tight control in the healthy muscle niche, contributes to fat and scar infiltrations in degenerative myopathies, such as in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD). Controlling FAP differentiation by means of small molecules may contribute to delay the adverse consequences of the progressive pathological degeneration while offering, at the same time, a wider temporal window for gene therapy and cell-based strategies. In a high content phenotypic screening, we identified the immunosuppressant, azathioprine (AZA) as a negative modulator of FAP adipogenesis. We show here that AZA negatively affects the adipogenic propensity of FAPs purified from wild type and mdx mice by impairing the expression of the master adipogenic regulator, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ). We show that this inhibition correlates with a decline in the activation of the AKT-mTOR axis, the main pathway that transduces the pro-adipogenic stimulus triggered by insulin. In addition, AZA exerts a cytostatic effect that has a negative impact on the mitotic clonal process that is required for the terminal differentiation of the preadipocyte-committed cells.","Sedimentary record from Patagonia, southern Chile supports cosmic-impact triggering of biomass burning, climate change, and megafaunal extinctions at 12.8 ka.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867437,Scientific reports,2019 03 29,"The Younger Dryas (YD) impact hypothesis posits that fragments of a large, disintegrating asteroid/comet struck North America, South America, Europe, and western Asia ~12,800 years ago. Multiple airbursts/impacts produced the YD boundary layer (YDB), depositing peak concentrations of platinum, high-temperature spherules, meltglass, and nanodiamonds, forming an isochronous datum at >50 sites across ~50 million km² of Earth's surface. This proposed event triggered extensive biomass burning, brief impact winter, YD climate change, and contributed to extinctions of late Pleistocene megafauna. In the most extensive investigation south of the equator, we report on a ~12,800-year-old sequence at Pilauco, Chile (~40°S), that exhibits peak YD boundary concentrations of platinum, gold, high-temperature iron- and chromium-rich spherules, and native iron particles rarely found in nature. A major peak in charcoal abundance marks an intense biomass-burning episode, synchronous with dramatic changes in vegetation, including a high-disturbance regime, seasonality in precipitation, and warmer conditions. This is anti-phased with northern-hemispheric cooling at the YD onset, whose rapidity suggests atmospheric linkage. The sudden disappearance of megafaunal remains and dung fungi in the YDB layer at Pilauco correlates with megafaunal extinctions across the Americas. The Pilauco record appears consistent with YDB impact evidence found at sites on four continents."

Yet, our ability to identify and validate effective combinations is limited by a combinatorial explosion, driven by both the large number of drug pairs as well as dosage combinations. Here we propose a network-based methodology to identify clinically efficacious drug combinations for specific diseases. By quantifying the network-based relationship between drug targets and disease proteins in the human protein-protein interactome, we show the existence of six distinct classes of drug-drug-disease combinations. Relying on approved drug combinations for hypertension and cancer, we find that only one of the six classes correlates with therapeutic effects: if the targets of the drugs both hit disease module, but target separate neighborhoods. This finding allows us to identify and validate antihypertensive combinations, offering a generic, powerful network methodology to identify efficacious combination therapies in drug development.",A Hox-TALE regulatory circuit for neural crest patterning is conserved across vertebrates.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867425,Nature communications,2019 04 05,"In jawed vertebrates (gnathostomes), Hox genes play an important role in patterning head and jaw formation, but mechanisms coupling Hox genes to neural crest (NC) are unknown. Here we use cross-species regulatory comparisons between gnathostomes and lamprey, a jawless extant vertebrate, to investigate conserved ancestral mechanisms regulating Hox2 genes in NC. Gnathostome Hoxa2 and Hoxb2 NC enhancers mediate equivalent NC expression in lamprey and gnathostomes, revealing ancient conservation of Hox upstream regulatory components in NC. In characterizing a lamprey hoxα2 NC/hindbrain enhancer, we identify essential Meis, Pbx, and Hox binding sites that are functionally conserved within Hoxa2/Hoxb2 NC enhancers. This suggests that the lamprey hoxα2 enhancer retains ancestral activity and that Hoxa2/Hoxb2 NC enhancers are ancient paralogues, which diverged in hindbrain and NC activities. This identifies an ancestral mechanism for Hox2 NC regulation involving a Hox-TALE regulatory circuit, potentiated by inputs from Meis and Pbx proteins and Hox auto-/cross-regulatory interactions.",Transcriptional profiling of human microglia reveals grey-white matter heterogeneity and multiple sclerosis-associated changes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867424,Nature communications,2019 04 05,"Here we report the transcriptional profile of human microglia, isolated from normal-appearing grey matter (GM) and white matter (WM) of multiple sclerosis (MS) and non-neurological control donors, to find possible early changes related to MS pathology. Microglia show a clear region-specific profile, indicated by higher expression of type-I interferon genes in GM and higher expression of NF-κB pathway genes in WM. Transcriptional changes in MS microglia also differ between GM and WM. MS WM microglia show increased lipid metabolism gene expression, which relates to MS pathology since active MS lesion-derived microglial nuclei show similar altered gene expression. Microglia from MS GM show increased expression of genes associated with glycolysis and iron homeostasis, possibly reflecting microglia reacting to iron depositions. Except for ADGRG1/GPR56, expression of homeostatic genes, such as P2RY12 and TMEM119, is unaltered in normal-appearing MS tissue, demonstrating overall preservation of microglia homeostatic functions in the initiation phase of MS.",Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 accelerates vascular calcification by upregulating Runx2.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867423,Nature communications,2019 04 05,"Vascular calcification is highly prevalent in end-stage renal diseases and is predictive of cardiovascular events and mortality. Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) inhibition or deletion is vasoprotective in several disease models. Here we show that PARP activity is increased in radial artery samples from patients with chronic renal failure, in arteries from uraemic rats, and in calcified vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) in vitro. PARP1 deficiency blocks, whereas PARP1 overexpression exacerbates, the transdifferentiation of VSMCs from a contractile to an osteogenic phenotype, the expression of mineralization-regulating proteins, and calcium deposition. PARP1 promotes Runx2 expression, and Runx2 deficiency offsets the pro-calcifying effects of PARP1. Activated PARP1 suppresses miRNA-204 expression via the IL-6/STAT3 pathway and thus relieves the repression of its target, Runx2, resulting in increased Runx2 protein. Together, these results suggest that PARP1 counteracts vascular calcification and that therapeutic agents that influence PARP1 activity may be of benefit to treat vascular calcification.",The development of synaptic transmission is time-locked to early social behaviors in rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867422,Nature communications,2019 04 05,"The development of functional synapses is a sequential process preserved across many brain areas. Here, we show that glutamatergic postsynaptic currents anticipated GABAergic currents in Layer II/III of the rat neocortex, in contrast to the pattern described for other brain areas. The frequencies of both glutamatergic and GABAergic currents increased abruptly at the beginning of the second postnatal week, supported by a serotonin upsurge. Integrative behaviors arose on postnatal day (P)9, while most motor and sensory behaviors, which are fundamental for pup survival, were already in place at approximately P7. A reduction in serotonin reuptake accelerated the development of functional synapses and integrative huddling behavior, while sparing motor and sensory function development. A decrease in synaptic transmission in Layer II/III induced by a chemogenetic approach only inhibited huddling. Thus, precise developmental sequences mediate early, socially directed behaviors for which neurotransmission and its modulation in supragranular cortical layers play key roles.",Calcium-activated 14-3-3 proteins as a molecular switch in salt stress tolerance.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867421,Nature communications,2019 04 05,"Calcium is a universal secondary messenger that triggers many cellular responses. However, it is unclear how a calcium signal is coordinately decoded by different calcium sensors, which in turn regulate downstream targets to fulfill a specific physiological function. Here we show that SOS2-LIKE PROTEIN KINASE5 (PKS5) can negatively regulate the Salt-Overly-Sensitive signaling pathway in Arabidopsis. PKS5 can interact with and phosphorylate SOS2 at Ser294, promote the interaction between SOS2 and 14-3-3 proteins, and repress SOS2 activity. However, salt stress promotes an interaction between 14-3-3 proteins and PKS5, repressing its kinase activity and releasing inhibition of SOS2. We provide evidence that 14-3-3 proteins bind to Ca2+, and that Ca2+ modulates 14-3-3-dependent regulation of SOS2 and PKS5 kinase activity. Our results suggest that a salt-induced calcium signal is decoded by 14-3-3 and SOS3/SCaBP8 proteins, which selectively activate/inactivate the downstream protein kinases SOS2 and PKS5 to regulate Na+ homeostasis by coordinately mediating plasma membrane Na+/H+ antiporter and H+-ATPase activity.","Amyloid β oligomers suppress excitatory transmitter release via presynaptic depletion of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867420,Nature communications,2019 04 05,"Amyloid β (Aβ) oligomer-induced aberrant neurotransmitter release is proposed to be a crucial early event leading to synapse dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease (AD). In the present study, we report that the release probability (Pr) at the synapse between the Schaffer collateral (SC) and CA1 pyramidal neurons is significantly reduced at an early stage in mouse models of AD with elevated Aβ production. High nanomolar synthetic oligomeric Aβ42 also suppresses Pr at the SC-CA1 synapse in wild-type mice. This Aβ-induced suppression of Pr is mainly due to an mGluR5-mediated depletion of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) in axons. Selectively inhibiting Aβ-induced PIP2 hydrolysis in the CA3 region of the hippocampus strongly prevents oligomeric Aβ-induced suppression of Pr at the SC-CA1 synapse and rescues synaptic and spatial learning and memory deficits in APP/PS1 mice. These results first reveal the presynaptic mGluR5-PIP2 pathway whereby oligomeric Aβ induces early synaptic deficits in AD.",Contractile forces in platelet aggregates under microfluidic shear gradients reflect platelet inhibition and bleeding risk.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867419,Nature communications,2019 04 05,"Platelets contract forcefully after their activation, contributing to the strength and stability of platelet aggregates and fibrin clots during blood coagulation. Viscoelastic approaches can be used to assess platelet-induced clot strengthening, but they require thrombin and fibrin generation and are unable to measure platelet forces directly. Here, we report a rapid, microfluidic approach for measuring the contractile force of platelet aggregates for the detection of platelet dysfunction. We find that platelet forces are significantly reduced when blood samples are treated with inhibitors of myosin, GPIb-IX-V, integrin αIIbβ3, P2Y12, or thromboxane generation. Clinically, we find that platelet forces are measurably lower in cardiology patients taking aspirin. We also find that measuring platelet forces can identify Emergency Department trauma patients who subsequently require blood transfusions. Together, these findings indicate that microfluidic quantification of platelet forces may be a rapid and useful approach for monitoring both antiplatelet therapy and traumatic bleeding risk.",Conformal hexagonal-boron nitride dielectric interface for tungsten diselenide devices with improved mobility and thermal dissipation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867418,Nature communications,2019 03 29,"Relatively low mobility and thermal conductance create challenges for application of tungsten diselenide (WSe2) in high performance devices. Dielectric interface is of extremely importance for improving carrier transport and heat spreading in a semiconductor device. Here, by near-equilibrium plasma-enhanced chemical vapour deposition, we realize catalyst-free growth of poly-crystalline two-dimensional hexagonal-boron nitride (2D-BN) with domains around 20~ 200 nm directly on SiO2/Si, quartz, sapphire, silicon or SiO2/Si with three-dimensional patterns at 300 °C. Owing to the atomically-clean van-der-Walls conformal interface and the fact that 2D-BN can better bridge the vibrational spectrum across the interface and protect interfacial heat conduction against substrate roughness, both improved performance and thermal dissipation of WSe2 field-effect transistor are realized with mobility around 56~ 121 cm2 V-1 s-1 and saturated power intensity up to 4.23 × 103 W cm-2. Owing to its simplicity, conformal growth on three-dimensional surface, compatibility with microelectronic process, it has potential for application in future two-dimensional electronics.",Dietary fatty acids fine-tune Piezo1 mechanical response.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867417,Nature communications,2019 04 20,"Mechanosensitive ion channels rely on membrane composition to transduce physical stimuli into electrical signals. The Piezo1 channel mediates mechanoelectrical transduction and regulates crucial physiological processes, including vascular architecture and remodeling, cell migration, and erythrocyte volume. The identity of the membrane components that modulate Piezo1 function remain largely unknown. Using lipid profiling analyses, we here identify dietary fatty acids that tune Piezo1 mechanical response. We find that margaric acid, a saturated fatty acid present in dairy products and fish, inhibits Piezo1 activation and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), present in fish oils, modulate channel inactivation. Force measurements reveal that margaric acid increases membrane bending stiffness, whereas PUFAs decrease it. We use fatty acid supplementation to abrogate the phenotype of gain-of-function Piezo1 mutations causing human dehydrated hereditary stomatocytosis. Beyond Piezo1, our findings demonstrate that cell-intrinsic lipid profile and changes in the fatty acid metabolism can dictate the cell's response to mechanical cues."

The flora of Lebanon includes many plants that have already been demonstrated to have medicinal value, and other species, such as Pentapera sicula libanotica, that are yet to be characterized. The present study characterized the chemical composition, anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-proliferative potential of aqueous, ethanol, and methanol extracts derived from the leaves of the Lebanese Pentapera plant. MATERIAL AND METHODS High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was used to determine the chemical composition. Gas chromatography (GC) coupled with mass spectrometry (MS) was applied to determine the content of essential oil. DPPH radical scavenging assay was performed to evaluate the anti-oxidant potential. The anti-inflammatory potential was assessed using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) by measuring TNF-alpha, IL-6, and CCL4 mRNA levels, and we assessed Cox-2 and iNOS proteins levels using Western blot (WB) analysis. MTT assay was carried out to determine the anti-proliferative potential. RESULTS We identified, mainly in the alcoholic (methanol and ethanol) extracts, distinct bioactive compounds with pharmacological relevance. In parallel, with their phytochemical content, these 2 extracts showed significant anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-proliferative capacities. CONCLUSIONS Pentapera sicula libanotica appears to be a promising pharmacological tool.","Costs of pharmacotherapy of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in relation to changing Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease guidelines (2007, 2011, and 2017 updates).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867403,Polish archives of internal medicine,2019 06 04,"INTRODUCTION Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is one of the most common chronic noninfectious diseases. The clinical management is determined by patient assignment to the severity stage of the disease in accordance with the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) guidelines. OBJECTIVES Our aim was to determine the economic implications of changing GOLD guidelines (2007, 2011, and 2017 updates) and their impact on the direct costs of pharmacological treatment of patients diagnosed with COPD. PATIENTS AND METHODS This analysis was based on data provided by a group of 298 out of 500 randomly selected primary care physicians in Poland (response rate, 59.6%). Each primary care physician provided information on 10 consecutive patients with COPD. These data were used to simulate the economic consequences of the 2007, 2011, and 2017 GOLD guideline updates. RESULTS Regardless of the GOLD guidelines used, pharmacotherapy of patients with a very severe form of COPD was most expensive. Pharmacotherapy costs would be reduced with each subsequent guideline. In the same group of 2597 COPD patients, the average monthly cost of the first‑line pharmacotherapy as well as the overall costs of pharmacotherapy (first- and second‑line) per patient would be the lowest when applying the therapeutic regimen in accordance with the 2017 GOLD guidelines. CONCLUSIONS Implementation of 2011 and 2017 GOLD guidelines, as compared with the 2007 update, would result in a reduction of direct costs of COPD treatment.",[An Experience of Using a Distraction Plate for an Elderly Patient with a Highly Communited Intraarticular Distal Radius Fracture].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867401,Journal of UOEH,2019 04 24,"We performed open reduction and internal fixation using a distraction plate in two cases of elderly patients with highly communited intraarticular open distal radius fractures. There was no corrective loss of intraarticular fracture fragment in either case. The implant was removed in one case because bone union was achieved. The plate was retained in the other case, without the hope of implant removal. Neither case complained of any marked disturbance of activities of daily living (ADL), and there was no pain at the time of the final follow up period. However, there is a high possibility of limitation of the range of motion (ROM) of the wrist after implant removal, therefore we need to judge the indications carefully.",[Cancer Family Care Learning Materials for Japanese General Ward Nurses].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867399,Journal of UOEH,2019 04 24,"Families of cancer patients are also subject to care, and early intervention is necessary. In general hospital wards, nurses have difficulty in performing satisfactory nursing care for families of cancer patients due to limited time to get involved. Their priority is to provide essential care for patients, thus it is inevitable that they cannot offer intervention for patients' families. In recent years, overtime work by nurses has been regarded as a problem, and implementation of in-service education within the working hours is recommended. Based on these backgrounds, we developed ""Learning materials for nurses, with a view to standardized care for the families of cancer patients hospitalized in general wards"".

Complications related to needle malfunction during the EBUS-TBNA procedure have recently been reported. We herein describe a rare case involving the successful management of a needle breakage that occurred as an unusual complication of EBUS-TBNA. An 81-year-old male patient with a medical history of myocardial infarction was introduced to our institution to undergo an evaluation for mediastinal and right hilar lymphadenopathy on chest computed tomography (CT). We performed EBUS-TBNA in a 14×10 mm subcarinal lymph node station using a 22 G aspiration needle (NA-201SX-4022, Vizishot®, Olympus, Japan) for diagnosing and staging of the patient's lung cancer. After the second aspiration, we noticed that the needle tip was broken and that it was stuck in the right main bronchus. We immediately removed the broken needle tip from the right main bronchus by flexible bronchoscopy using an ID 8.5 mm tracheal tube without cuff inflation. The length of the needle tip was 13 mm and it was considerably bent. The EBUS scope did not suffer any apparent damage. The patient did not have any other procedure-related complications. Needle breakage during EBUS-TBNA is rare; however, inhaling or swallowing of a broken needle tip has the potential to cause serious complications. Bronchoscopists should therefore be aware of the possibility of needle breakage, which is an important complication during EBUS-TBNA.",Relationships Between Chronic Musculoskeletal Pain and Working Hours and Sleeping Hours: A Cross-sectional Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867397,Journal of UOEH,2019 04 24,"Ten to twenty percent of the population of Japan has chronic pain. Although studies have confirmed a relationship between sleeping hours and chronic pain, it remains unclear whether there is an association between working hours and chronic pain, especially chronic musculoskeletal pain (CMP), in workers. A self-administered questionnaire that sought information regarding background characteristics and work-related factors was sent to 118 enterprises; finally, 1,747 participants were included in the analysis and were classified into CMP (n = 448) and non-CMP (n = 1299) groups. Logistic regression analysis revealed that age (odds ratio [OR] = 1.02, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.01-1.03), sex (reference: female, OR = 0.68, 95% CI: 0.52-0.88), working hours (OR = 1.11, 95% CI: 1.03-1.20), and sleeping hours (OR = 0.84, 95% CI: 0.75-0.95) were significantly associated with CMP. Participants were categorized into four groups according to working hours (long: ≥ 9 hours/day [long-work], short: < 9 hours/day [short-work]) and sleeping hours (long: ≥ 7 hours/day [long-sleep], short: < 7 hours/day [short-sleep]). Furthermore, logistic regression analysis showed that the CMP OR was 2.02 (95% CI: 1.46-2.78) times higher in 'long-work plus short-sleep workers' and 1.47 (95% CI: 0.94-2.30) times higher in 'long-work plus long-sleep workers' than in 'short-work plus long-sleep workers'. Thus, working hours are associated with CMP frequency, but sleeping sufficiently may prevent CMP in workers even if they work for long hours. In conclusion, adequate instructions on sleeping hours should be provided by occupational health staff, as this may be effective in preventing CMP.",Frequency of Exposure to Secondhand Smoke Outside the Home Is Associated with a Lower FEV1/FVC in Male Workers Regardless of Smoking Status.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867396,Journal of UOEH,2019 04 24,"Decreased respiratory function associated with aging leads to the onset of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and increased risk of death in the elderly. Prevention of a decline in respiratory function from a young age is important. This study aimed to clarify the factors that affect decreased forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1)/forced vital capacity (FVC), an index of obstructive respiratory disorder caused by airway obstruction, by considering the influence of body composition and lifestyle. We recruited 262 employed adult men and determined their lifestyle-related factors, including smoking status, past or current secondhand smoke (SHS) exposure, exposure to SHS outside the home, and physical activity (PA). Body composition and respiratory function were also measured. The data were then compared with those of non-smokers using logistic regression analysis, adjusting for age. We also investigated factors influencing FEV1/FVC using multiple regression analysis, adjusting for age, height, smoking status, and lifestyle. Current smokers and heavy smokers exhibited significantly lower amounts of PA and had a higher body fat%, visceral fat area, prevalence of cohabitation with smokers, and frequency of SHS exposure outside the home, and FEV1/FVC was significantly lower in heavy smokers. A multiple regression analysis revealed that FEV1/FVC was associated only with the frequency of SHS exposure outside the home. It is important for occupational health personnel of a company to advise both non-smokers and smokers to avoid SHS to prevent chronic obstructive pulmonary disease onset. This needs to be coupled with encouragement to quit smoking, especially for heavy smokers.",Chemical Composition and in vivo Efficacy of the Essential Oil of Mentha piperita L. in the Suppression of Crown Gall Disease on Tomato Plants.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867394,Journal of oleo science,2019 05 07,"This study was undertaken to determine the antibacterial efficacy of the essential oil (EO) of peppermint (Mentha piperita L.), in vitro and in vivo, against the phytopathogenic bacteria Agrobacterium tumefaciens (A. tumefaciens).

The major constituents were menthol (33.59%) and iso-menthone (33.00%). This EO exerted a bactericidal activity against multiple strains of Agrobacterium species with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values ranged from 0.01 to 12.50 mg/mL. In planta experiments, M. piperita EO, tested at concentration of 200 mg/mL, completely inhibited the formation of tumors on tomato plants inoculated with pathogenic strain A. tumefaciens ATCC 23308T.

Elobixibat selectively inhibited IBAT in vitro, and dose-dependently inhibited the absorption of bile acids in vivo. Also, elobixibat dose-dependently increased wet fecal weight in a rat loperamide-induced constipation model. The drug-drug interaction study suggested that elobixibat may have a clinically slight inhibitory effect on P-glycoprotein. In a phase II study with chronic constipation, the recommended dosage for oral administration of elobixibat once daily was estimated to be 10 mg. In a phase 3 study with chronic constipation, the superiority of the elobixibat 10 mg group to the placebo group was demonstrated in the change from baseline (ie, the last week of the 2-week run-in period) in the frequency of spontaneous bowel movements per week during the first week of treatment set as the primary endpoint. In a long-term study in which elobixibat was administered to patients with chronic constipation for 52 weeks, the ameliorating effects of elobixibat on constipation were observed from the first week of treatment and maintained well until week 52. In addition, the safety/tolerability of elobixibat administered once daily for 52 weeks was considered to be acceptable. Therefore, elobixibat has a mechanism of action that differs from any of the existing therapeutic agents for constipation and is expected to become one of the new treatment options for chronic constipation.",[Estimation of mechanism-of-action of pharmaceutical compounds based on quantitative systems pharmacology].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867381,Nihon yakurigaku zasshi.

Folia pharmacologica Japonica,2019 05 02,"Primary cilium is a membrane-protruding immotile sensory organelle. It had been supposed that the cilium was a static organelle for long periods. However, recent studies have uncovered that the cilium is dynamically organized organelle in a cell cycle-dependent manner; it is formed during G0/G1 phase and resorbed when the cells enter cell division cycle. Despite the primary cilium is very short and its surface area is extremely small, the cilium possesses a few kinds of G protein-coupled receptors, growth factor receptors and ion channels. Therefore, it can function as a signaling receptor for selective bioactive ligands and mechanical stresses. Dysregulation of the ciliary dynamics is linked with hereditary disorders, so called ""ciliopathy"", with clinical manifestations of microcephaly, polycystic kidney, situs inversus, polydactyly, and so on. No effective medical treatment for the ciliopathies has been available. Increasing evidences about the molecular mechanisms of ciliary dynamics and ciliary functions have revealed that enormous number of molecules regulate a cycle of ciliogenesis, cilium-derived signaling, ciliary resorption and elimination. However, it is a fact that research progress is far inferior to the full disclosure of the molecular mechanisms. Further studies are required to clarify the pathogenesis of the cilipathies. Moreover, efficient medical treatments are expected to be developed by pharmacological approaches.",[Pharmacotherapy from the viewpoint of nursing: pharmacology education for nurses as a practitioner of medication].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867379,Nihon yakurigaku zasshi.

In addition, it is also important to understand how medicine is used in clinical practice and what side effects should be expected from a pharmacological viewpoint. For this purpose, it is necessary for a pharmacologist to grasp the trend of drug therapy in clinical practice and learn it from the viewpoint of pharmacology by students. As a future task, it is necessary to strengthen cooperation with other fields, especially pharmacotherapeutics, and to make appropriate cooperation with human resources who can feed back the latest drug treatment on actual clinical sites to university education.

This is symbolized by JACME (Japan Accreditation Council for Medical Education), aiming to strengthen and advance medical education in Japan from an international standpoint. This movement was partly because ECFMG (Education Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates) that issues a certificate for post-graduate clinical training in US to graduates of non-US medical schools, made an announcement that only graduates from medical schools accredited based on the global standards would be eligible for taking the ECFMG examination after 2023.

The relationship between those results and the histological sub-classification of the Laennec liver fibrosis scoring system was analyzed. The calculated value of R from this formula will indicate the differing degree of liver fibrosis in a patient: i) the value of 0.802 ≤ R < 1 indicates the early stage of liver cirrhosis, which corresponds to Laennec stages 0-3; ii) the value of 0.752 ≤ R < 0.802 indicates the mild stage of liver cirrhosis, which corresponds to Laennec stage 4A; iii) the value of 0.698 ≤ R < 0.752 indicates the moderate stage of liver cirrhosis, which corresponds to Laennec stage 4B; and iv) the value of 0.444 ≤ R < 0.698 indicates the severe stage of liver cirrhosis, which corresponds to Laennec stage 4C. The hope is that this formula for preoperative evaluation of the degree of liver fibrosis using non-invasive methods would be useful in the clinical diagnosis and treatment of patients with HCC in the future."

We genotyped 32 microsatellites and a mitochondrial D-loop region in 77 Misaki horses (80.2% of the population). The average number of alleles, observed heterozygosity, and expected heterozygosity were 3.4, 0.509, and 0.497, respectively. A neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree of individuals was constructed. Moreover, the results suggested that Misaki horses experienced a bottleneck, but it was neither severe nor recent. In addition, three mitochondrial haplotypes were confirmed. Consequently, we clarified the genetic background of Misaki horses that have been resident at Cape Toi for a long time.",Memory immune responses and protection of chickens against a nephropathogenic infectious bronchitis virus strain by combining live heterologous and inactivated homologous vaccines.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867350,The Journal of veterinary medical science,2019 05 07,"In this study, we evaluated antibody and cell-mediated immune (CMI) responses in the mucosal and systemic compartments and protection against challenge with a nephropathogenic Brazilian (BR-I) strain of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) in chickens submitted to a vaccination regime comprising a priming dose of heterologous live attenuated Massachusetts vaccine followed by a booster dose of an experimental homologous inactivated vaccine two weeks later. This immunization protocol elicited significant increases in serum and lachrymal levels of anti-IBV IgG antibodies and upregulated the expression of CMI response genes, such as those encoding CD8β chain and Granzyme homolog A in tracheal and kidney tissues at 3, 7, and 11 days post-infection in the vaccinated chickens. Additionally, vaccinated and challenged chickens showed reduced viral loads and microscopic lesion counts in tracheal and kidney tissues, and their antibody and CMI responses were negatively correlated with viral loads in the trachea and kidney. In conclusion, the combination of live attenuated vaccine containing the Massachusetts strain with a booster dose of an inactivated vaccine, containing a BR-I IBV strain, confers effective protection against infection with nephropathogenic homologous IBV strain because of the induction of consistent memory immune responses mediated by IgG antibodies and TCD8 cells in the mucosal and systemic compartments of chickens submitted to this vaccination regime.",Surface wettability and nano roughness at different grit blasting operational pressures and their effects on resin cement to zirconia adhesion.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867349,Dental materials journal,2019 06 03,"This study analyzed the effect of grit blasting pressures on resin cement to zirconia (ZrO2) adhesion using enclosed mold shear bond test (EM-SBS). ZrO2 blanks were pre-treated with Rocatec™ Soft as follows: group 1: control, group 2: specimens treated at 80 kPa, group 3: at 180 kPa, group 4: at 280 kPa, and group 5: at 380 kPa. Monobond® N and Multilink® Speed were used as the silane and resin cement, respectively. Next, the blanks were assigned into three sub-groups (n=8, N=108) according to storage conditions. A non-linear relation was observed between EM-SBS and contact angle versus grit blasting pressure (r=-0.542, p=0.01). According to ANOVA (p<0.05), the EM-SBS values with both 180 kPa (17.4±6.7 MPa) and 280 kPa (19.4±4.8 MPa) were statistically higher after 12,000 thermo-cycles. Relatively equal thermo-cycled bond strength might also be achieved with intermediate (180 kPa) grit blasting pressure instead of the recommended 280 kPa.",Fracture toughness of experimental mica-based glass-ceramics and four commercial glass-ceramics restorative dental materials.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867348,Dental materials journal,2019 06 03,"The mica-based glass-ceramics were prepared in the SiO2-Al2O3-MgO-MgF2-SrCO3-CaCO3-CaF2-P2O5 glass system. There were four mica-based glass-ceramics produced in this study according to the pigment added (CeO2 or Pr-ZrSiO4/Fe-ZrSiO4) and crystallization time (5-35 min). Four dental glass-ceramics, which were leucite-based, lithium disilicate-based and two zirconia reinforced lithium silicate ceramics, were also tested. The phase identification of mica-based glass-ceramics was performed using an X-ray diffractometer. The fracture toughness (KIC) was determined using the fractographic analysis approach. The one-way ANOVA was used to analyze the significant differences among the obtained KIC values at a=0.05. The results from the phase analysis showed that the mica glassceramics consisted of calcium-mica, fluorapatite and strontiumapatite. The KIC of mica-based glass-ceramics ranged between 1.36 to 1.53 MPa•m1/2 which were superior to only that of a leucite-based glass-ceramic.

Syneresis & imbibition did not change over time for both groups, but EG showed lower values at days 7th and 30th. The control group (CG)'s and the experimental group (EG)'s weights were similar before the solubility assay, but after seven days, CG exhibited weight gain in comparison to EG. The elasticity module had no significant differences between groups. The CG showed lower surface microhardness compared to the EG. CG and EG had similar behaviors regarding fluoride release.

Specimens with 5×5mm were prepared from extracted bovine teeth. Staining with tea and exposure by NADC were repeated for five times and color was measured at each step. Other specimens were prepared and surface roughness (Ra) and microhardness (Vickers hardness) were measured after exposure by NADC. The repeated NADC exposure without peroxide or water showed bleaching effect for stained bovine teeth. The surface roughness was not changed by NADC exposure.

Cytological findings of invasive FVPTC and NIFTP were very similar to each other but differed from those of conventional PTC. Intranuclear cytoplasmic inclusions, true papillary cell clusters, monolayered cell sheets, ropy colloids, multinucleate giant cells, psammoma bodies, and cystic background were the observed characteristic features of conventional PTC. Microfollicular cell clusters and dense globules of colloids were characteristic features of invasive FVPTC and NIFTP. Scoring the eight parameters (intranuclear cytoplasmic inclusions, nuclear grooves, powdery chromatin, true papillary cell clusters, ropy colloids, multinucleate giant cells, psammoma bodies, and cystic background) readily distinguished NIFTP from conventional PTC, but could not distinguish NIFTP from invasive FVPTC. The average total score of NIFTP, invasive FVPTC, and conventional PTC were 2.60 ± 0.55, 2.63 ± 0.62, and 4.57 ± 0.99, respectively. The difference between conventional PTC and NIFTP or invasive FVPTC was statistically significant (p < 0.001, Student's t-test). Individuals with more than three of the identified parameters likely harbor conventional PTC, rather than NIFTP. In this way, 87.5% (112/128) of conventional PTCs could be differentiated from NIFTP, and definitively diagnosed as malignant by cytology.",Effects of tetrahydrobiopterin combined with nebivolol on cardiac diastolic function in SHRs.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867344,Biological & pharmaceutical bulletin,2019 03 14,"This study aimed to evaluate the effects of combined use of BH4 and nebivolol on cardiac diastolic dysfunction in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). Twelve-week-old male SHRs were treated with tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), nebivolol, or a combination of both. Left ventricle function was evaluated, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production [including dihydroethidium (DHE) and 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT)], NO synthase (NOS) activity and the level of nitric oxide (NO) in myocardial tissue were determined. The expression levels of endothelial NOS (eNOS), phospholamban (PLN), sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA2a), β3-adrenoceptor, cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), and protein kinase G (PKG) were assayed. Treatment with BH4, nebivolol, or both reversed the noninvasive indexes of diastolic function, including E/E' and E'/A', and the invasive indexes, including tau, -dP/dtmin, -dP/dtmin/LVSP, and LVEDP in SHRs. mRNA and protein expression levels of eNOS dimer, phosphorylated PLN, SERCA2a, cGMP, and PKG in the myocardium of treated SHRs were significantly up-regulated compared with those in control rats (P<0.05 or P<0.01). The expression levels of 3-NT and DHE were reduced in all treated groups (P<0.05 or P<0.01). Notably, combined use of BH4 and nebivolol had better cardioprotective effects than monotherapies. BH4 or nebivolol has a protective effect on diastolic dysfunction in SHRs, and BH4 combined with nebivolol may exert a synergistically cardioprotective effect through activation of β3-adrenoceptor and the NO/cGMP/PKG signaling pathway.",Astragaloside IV Regulates the PI3K/Akt/HO-1 Signaling Pathway and Inhibits H9c2 Cardiomyocyte Injury Induced by Hypoxia-Reoxygenation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867343,Biological & pharmaceutical bulletin,2019 05 07,"Astragaloside IV (AS-IV) is one of the main pharmacologically active compounds found in Astragalus membranaceus. AS-IV has protective effects against ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI), but its mechanism of action has not yet been determined. This study aims to investigate the effect of AS-IV on IRI and its effect on the phosphadylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/heme oxygenase (HO-1) signaling pathway through in vitro experiments. Firstly, a cell culture model of myocardiocyte hypoxia-reoxygenation (H/R) injury was replicated. After AS-IV treatment, cell viability, reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, as well as the content or activity of the cellular factors lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde (MDA), interleukin 6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), were measured to evaluate the effect of treatment with AS-IV. The effect of AS-IV on HO-1 protein expression and nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and Bach1 protein expression was determined by Western blotting. Finally, a reversal of the effect of AS-IV treatment was observed following co-incubation with a PI3K inhibitor. Our results show that AS-IV has good protective effect on H/R injury and has anti-oxidative stress and anti-inflammatory effects. It can regulate the expression of Nrf2 and Bach1 proteins in the nucleus and promote the expression of HO-1 protein, while a PI3K inhibitor can partially reverse the above effects. This study suggests that the PI3K/Akt/HO-1 signaling pathway may be a key signaling pathway for the anti-IRI effect of AS-IV.",Infection Control in Nursery Schools and Schools Using a School Absenteeism Surveillance System.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867342,The Tohoku journal of experimental medicine,2019 06 07,"Infection control in nursery schools and schools is important for community health and the health of children. In Japan, caregivers of children or students usually report the absence due to illness to their attending nurseries or schools, including symptoms and diagnosed diseases. The (Nursery) School Absenteeism Surveillance System, (N)SASSy, covers about 60% of schools and 40% of nurseries in Japan. In this paper, we evaluated the benefits of (N)SASSy as an infection control measure by a public health center. Mito Public Health Center (MPHC) covers 58 nurseries and 186 schools, as of May 2015, and called the nurseries and/or schools to confirm the situation, in case of aberration detected through (N)SASSy. The outcome was defined as the proportion of cluster avoidance by advice from MPHC. A cluster was identified, when the number of patients at the same facility with the same symptom or diagnosed disease was greater than ten during the prior seven days. During the study period (April 2015-March 2016), MPHC advised 85 times, and clusters were avoided 82 times (96.5%). The proportion of cluster avoidance was 100% for fever, enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli infection, respiratory syncytial virus infection, or streptococcal pharyngitis infection. The proportion of cluster avoidance for diarrhea, vomiting or gastroenteritis infection, mumps, hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD), and influenza was 78.8, 50.0, 20.0, and 6.7%, respectively. In conclusion, advice from a public health center given by phone based on information from (N)SASSy will be helpful for reducing the number of clusters of infectious diseases, except for HFMD and influenza."

Initial preclinical safety and drug release were demonstrated in a swine model with a panel of TB antibiotics. We anticipate multiple applications in the field of infectious diseases, as well as for other indications where multigram depots could impart meaningful benefits to patients, helping maximize adherence to their medication.",Preclinical development of an oral anti-Wolbachia macrolide drug for the treatment of lymphatic filariasis and onchocerciasis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867321,Science translational medicine,2019 05 15,"There is an urgent global need for a safe macrofilaricide drug to accelerate elimination of the neglected tropical diseases onchocerciasis and lymphatic filariasis. From an anti-infective compound library, the macrolide veterinary antibiotic, tylosin A, was identified as a hit against Wolbachia This bacterial endosymbiont is required for filarial worm viability and fertility and is a validated target for macrofilaricidal drugs. Medicinal chemistry was undertaken to develop tylosin A analogs with improved oral bioavailability. Two analogs, A-1535469 and A-1574083, were selected. Their efficacy was tested against the gold-standard second-generation tetracycline antibiotics, doxycycline and minocycline, in mouse and gerbil infection models of lymphatic filariasis (Brugia malayi and Litomosoides sigmodontis) and onchocerciasis (Onchocerca ochengi). A 1- or 2-week course of oral A-1535469 or A-1574083 provided >90% Wolbachia depletion from nematodes in infected animals, resulting in a block in embryogenesis and depletion of microfilarial worm loads. The two analogs delivered comparative or superior efficacy compared to a 3- to 4-week course of doxycycline or minocycline. A-1574083 (now called ABBV-4083) was selected for further preclinical testing. Cardiovascular studies in dogs and toxicology studies in rats and dogs revealed no adverse effects at doses (50 mg/kg) that achieved plasma concentrations >10-fold above the efficacious concentration. A-1574083 (ABBV-4083) shows potential as an anti-Wolbachia macrolide with an efficacy, pharmacology, and safety profile that is compatible with a short-term oral drug course for treating lymphatic filariasis and onchocerciasis.",Noninvasive high-resolution electromyometrial imaging of uterine contractions in a translational sheep model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867320,Science translational medicine,2019 03 26,"In current clinical practice, uterine contractions are monitored via a tocodynamometer or an intrauterine pressure catheter, both of which provide crude information about contractions. Although electrohysterography/electromyography can measure uterine electrical activity, this method lacks spatial specificity and thus cannot accurately measure the exact location of electrical initiation and location-specific propagation patterns of uterine contractions. To comprehensively evaluate three-dimensional uterine electrical activation patterns, we describe here the development of electromyometrial imaging (EMMI) to display the three-dimensional uterine contractions at high spatial and temporal resolution. EMMI combines detailed body surface electrical recording with body-uterus geometry derived from magnetic resonance images. We used a sheep model to show that EMMI can reconstruct uterine electrical activation patterns from electrodes placed on the abdomen. These patterns closely match those measured with electrodes placed directly on the uterine surface. In addition, modeling experiments showed that EMMI reconstructions are minimally affected by noise and geometrical deformation. Last, we show that EMMI can be used to noninvasively measure uterine contractions in sheep in the same setup as would be used in humans. Our results indicate that EMMI can noninvasively, safely, accurately, robustly, and feasibly image three-dimensional uterine electrical activation during contractions in sheep and suggest that similar results might be obtained in clinical setting.",ZEB1 suppression sensitizes KRAS mutant cancers to MEK inhibition by an IL17RD-dependent mechanism.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867319,Science translational medicine,2019 03 14,"Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase (MEK) inhibitors have failed to show clinical benefit in Kirsten rat sarcoma (KRAS) mutant lung cancer due to various resistance mechanisms. To identify differential therapeutic sensitivities between epithelial and mesenchymal lung tumors, we performed in vivo small hairpin RNA screens, proteomic profiling, and analysis of patient tumor datasets, which revealed an inverse correlation between mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling dependency and a zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1)-regulated epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Mechanistic studies determined that MAPK signaling dependency in epithelial lung cancer cells is due to the scaffold protein interleukin-17 receptor D (IL17RD), which is directly repressed by ZEB1. Lung tumors in multiple Kras mutant murine models with increased ZEB1 displayed low IL17RD expression, accompanied by MAPK-independent tumor growth and therapeutic resistance to MEK inhibition. Suppression of ZEB1 function with miR-200 expression or the histone deacetylase inhibitor mocetinostat sensitized resistant cancer cells to MEK inhibition and markedly reduced in vivo tumor growth, showing a promising combinatorial treatment strategy for KRAS mutant cancers. In human lung tumor samples, high ZEB1 and low IL17RD expression correlated with low MAPK signaling, presenting potential markers that predict patient response to MEK inhibitors.",Contribution of the Cytoplasmic Determinants of Vpu to the Expansion of Virus-Containing Compartments in HIV-1-Infected Macrophages.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867316,Journal of virology,2019 06 10,"HIV-1 infection of macrophages leads to the sequestration of newly formed viruses in intracellular plasma membrane-connected structures termed virus-containing compartments (VCCs), where virions remain infectious and hidden from immune surveillance. The cellular restriction factor bone marrow stromal cell antigen 2 (BST2), which prevents HIV-1 dissemination by tethering budding viral particles at the plasma membrane, can be found in VCCs. The HIV-1 accessory protein Vpu counteracts the restriction factor BST2 by downregulating its expression and removing it from viral budding sites. Numerous studies described these Vpu countermeasures in CD4+ T cells or model cell lines, but the interplay between Vpu and BST2 in VCC formation and HIV-1 production in macrophages is less explored. Here, we show that Vpu expression in HIV-1-infected macrophages enhances viral release. This effect is related to Vpu's ability to circumvent BST2 antiviral activity. We show that in absence of Vpu, BST2 is enriched in VCCs and colocalizes with capsid p24, whereas Vpu expression significantly reduces the presence of BST2 in these compartments. Furthermore, our data reveal that BST2 is dispensable for the formation of VCCs and that Vpu expression impacts the volume of these compartments. This Vpu activity partly depends on BST2 expression and requires the integrity of the Vpu transmembrane domain, the dileucine-like motif E59XXXLV64 and phosphoserines 52 and 56 of Vpu. Altogether, these results highlight that Vpu controls the volume of VCCs and promotes HIV-1 release from infected macrophages.IMPORTANCE HIV-1 infection of macrophages leads to the sequestration of newly formed viruses in virus-containing compartments (VCCs), where virions remain infectious and hidden from immune surveillance. The restriction factor BST2, which prevents HIV-1 dissemination by tethering budding viral particles, can be found in VCCs. The HIV-1 Vpu protein counteracts BST2. This study explores the interplay between Vpu and BST2 in the viral protein functions on HIV-1 release and viral particle sequestration in VCCs in macrophages. The results show that Vpu controls the volume of VCCs and favors viral particle release. These Vpu functions partly depend on Vpu's ability to antagonize BST2. This study highlights that the transmembrane domain of Vpu and two motifs of the Vpu cytoplasmic domain are required for these functions. These motifs were notably involved in the control of the volume of VCCs by Vpu but were dispensable for the prevention of the specific accumulation of BST2 in these structures.",Kinetics of Early Innate Immune Activation during HIV-1 Infection of Humanized Mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867315,Journal of virology,2019 06 10,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection is associated with aberrant immune activation; however, most model systems for HIV-1 have been used during established infection. Here, we utilize ultrasensitive HIV-1 quantification to delineate early events during the eclipse, burst, and chronic phases of HIV-1 infection in humanized mice. We show that very early in infection, HIV-1 suppresses peripheral type I interferon (IFN) and interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) responses, including the HIV-1 restriction factor IFI44. At the peak of innate immune activation, prior to CD4 T cell loss, HIV-1 infection differentially affects peripheral and lymphoid Toll-like receptor (TLR) expression profiles in T cells and macrophages. This results in a trend toward an altered activation of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), and interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3). The subsequent type I and III IFN responses result in preferential induction of peripheral ISG responses. Following this initial innate immune activation, peripheral expression of the HIV-1 restriction factor SAM domain- and HD domain-containing protein 1 (SAMHD1) returns to levels below those observed in uninfected mice, suggesting that HIV-1 interferes with their basal expression. However, peripheral cells still retain their responsiveness to exogenous type I IFN, whereas splenic cells show a reduction in select ISGs in response to IFN. This demonstrates the highly dynamic nature of very early HIV-1 infection and suggests that blocks to the induction of HIV-1 restriction factors contribute to the establishment of viral persistence.IMPORTANCE Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection is restricted to humans and some nonhuman primates (e.g., chimpanzee and gorilla). Alternative model systems based on simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection of macaques are available but do not recapitulate all aspects of HIV-1 infection and disease. Humanized mice, which contain a human immune system, can be used to study HIV-1, but only limited information on early events and immune responses is available to date. Here, we describe very early immune responses to HIV-1 and demonstrate a suppression of cell-intrinsic innate immunity. Furthermore, we show that HIV-1 infection interacts differently with innate immune responses in blood and lymphoid organs.",The Infectious Bronchitis Coronavirus Envelope Protein Alters Golgi pH To Protect the Spike Protein and Promote the Release of Infectious Virus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867314,Journal of virology,2019 06 10,"Coronaviruses (CoVs) assemble by budding into the lumen of the early Golgi complex prior to exocytosis. The small CoV envelope (E) protein plays roles in assembly, virion release, and pathogenesis. CoV E has a single hydrophobic domain (HD), is targeted to Golgi membranes, and has cation channel activity in vitro The E protein from avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) has dramatic effects on the secretory system, which require residues in the HD. Mutation of the HD of IBV E in a recombinant virus background results in impaired growth kinetics, impaired release of infectious virions, accumulation of IBV spike (S) protein on the plasma membrane compared to wild-type (WT) IBV-infected cells, and aberrant cleavage of IBV S on virions. We previously reported the formation of two distinct oligomeric pools of IBV E in transfected and infected cells. Disruption of the secretory pathway by IBV E correlates with a form that is likely monomeric, suggesting that the effects on the secretory pathway are independent of E ion channel activity. Here, we present evidence suggesting that the monomeric form of IBV E correlates with an increased Golgi luminal pH. Infection with IBV or expression of IBV E induces neutralization of Golgi pH, promoting a model in which IBV E alters the secretory pathway through interaction with host cell factors, protecting IBV S from premature cleavage and leading to the efficient release of infectious virus from the cells. This is the first demonstration of a coronavirus-induced alteration in the microenvironment of the secretory pathway.IMPORTANCE Coronaviruses are important human pathogens with significant zoonotic potential. Progress has been made toward identifying potential vaccine candidates for highly pathogenic human CoVs, including the use of attenuated viruses that lack the CoV E protein or express E mutants. However, no approved vaccines or antiviral therapeutics exist. Understanding the role of the CoV E protein in virus assembly and release is thus an important prerequisite for potential vaccines as well as in identifying novel antiviral therapeutics.",The Transcriptome of Latent Human Cytomegalovirus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867313,Journal of virology,2019 06 10,"The latent human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) transcriptome has been extremely difficult to define due to the scarcity of naturally latent cells and the complexity of available models. The genomic era offers many approaches to transcriptome profiling that hold great potential for elucidating this challenging issue.

Instead, they portray the hallmark of HCMV latent infection as low-level expression of a broad spectrum of canonical viral lytic genes.",Human Cytomegalovirus DNA Polymerase Subunit UL44 Antagonizes Antiviral Immune Responses by Suppressing IRF3- and NF-κB-Mediated Transcription.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867312,Journal of virology,2019 06 10,"Innate immunity is the first line of host defense against viral invasion. The induction of type I interferons (IFNs) and inflammatory cytokines is essential to host antiviral immune responses, which are also key targets of viral immune evasion. Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) can establish long-term latent infections, in which immune evasion is a pivotal step. In this study, we identified HCMV protein UL44, a DNA polymerase processivity factor, as an inhibitor of the interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3)- and NF-κB-dependent antiviral response. Ectopic expression of UL44 inhibited HCMV-triggered induction of downstream effector genes and enhanced viral replication. Conversely, knockdown of UL44 potentiated HCMV-triggered induction of downstream antiviral genes. UL44 interacted with IRF3 and p65, and it inhibited the binding of IRF3 and NF-κB to the promoters of their downstream antiviral genes. These findings reveal an important mechanism of immune evasion by HCMV at the transcriptional level.IMPORTANCE Induction of type I IFNs and inflammatory cytokines plays pivotal roles in host antiviral innate immune responses. Viruses have evolved various mechanisms to interfere with these processes. HCMV causes severe ailments in immunodeficient populations and is a major cause of birth defects. It has been shown that HCMV antagonizes host innate immune defenses, which is important for establishing immune evasion and latent infection. In this study, we identified the HCMV DNA polymerase subunit UL44 as a suppressor of antiviral innate immune responses. Overexpression of UL44 impaired HCMV-triggered induction of type I IFNs and other antiviral genes and thus potentiated viral replication, whereas UL44 deficiency showed opposite effects. Mechanistic studies indicated that UL44 acts by inhibiting the binding of IRF3 and NF-κB to the promoters of downstream antiviral genes. These findings defined an important mechanism of HCMV immune evasion at the transcriptional level, which may provide a therapeutic target for the treatment of HCMV infection."

This study investigated biologically and biotechnologically relevant aspects of the relationship in foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) between capsid structure and thermostability and between thermostability and infectivity. In the FMDV capsid, a substantial number of amino acid side chains at the interfaces between pentameric subunits are charged at neutral pH. Here a mutational analysis revealed that the essential role for virus infection of most of the 8 tested charged groups is not related to substantial changes in capsid protein expression or processing or in capsid assembly or stability against a thermally induced dissociation into pentamers. However, the positively charged side chains of R2018 and H3141, located at the interpentamer interfaces close to the capsid 2-fold symmetry axes, were found to be critical both for virus infectivity and for keeping the capsid in a state of weak thermostability. A charge-restoring substitution (N2019H) that was repeatedly fixed during amplification of viral genomes carrying deleterious mutations reverted both the lethal and capsid-stabilizing effects of the substitution H3141A, leading to a double mutant virus with close to normal infectivity and thermolability. H3141A and other thermostabilizing substitutions had no detectable effect on capsid resistance to acid-induced dissociation into pentamers. The results suggest that FMDV infectivity requires limited local stability around the 2-fold axes at the interpentamer interfaces of the capsid. The implications for the mechanism of genome uncoating in FMDV and the development of thermostabilized vaccines against foot-and-mouth disease are discussed.IMPORTANCE This study provides novel insights into the little-known structural determinants of the balance between thermal stability and instability in the capsid of foot-and-mouth disease virus and into the relationship between capsid stability and virus infectivity. The results provide new guidelines for the development of thermostabilized empty capsid-based recombinant vaccines against foot-and-mouth disease, one of the economically most important animal diseases worldwide.",Essential Role of Enterovirus 2A Protease in Counteracting Stress Granule Formation and the Induction of Type I Interferon.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867299,Journal of virology,2019 06 10,"Most viruses have acquired mechanisms to suppress antiviral alpha/beta interferon (IFN-α/β) and stress responses. Enteroviruses (EVs) actively counteract the induction of IFN-α/β gene transcription and stress granule (SG) formation, which are increasingly implicated as a platform for antiviral signaling, but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Both viral proteases (2Apro and 3Cpro) have been implicated in the suppression of these responses, but these conclusions predominantly rely on ectopic overexpression of viral proteases or addition of purified viral proteases to cell lysates. Here, we present a detailed and comprehensive comparison of the effect of individual enterovirus proteases on the formation of SGs and the induction of IFN-α/β gene expression in infected cells for representative members of the enterovirus species EV-A to EV-D. First, we show that SG formation and IFN-β induction are suppressed in cells infected with EV-A71, coxsackie B3 virus (CV-B3), CV-A21, and EV-D68. By introducing genes encoding CV-B3 proteases in a recombinant encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) that was designed to efficiently activate antiviral responses, we show that CV-B3 2Apro, but not 3Cpro, is the major antagonist that counters SG formation and IFN-β gene transcription and that 2Apro's proteolytic activity is essential for both functions. 2Apro efficiently suppressed SG formation despite protein kinase R (PKR) activation and α subunit of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 phosphorylation, suggesting that 2Apro antagonizes SG assembly or promotes its disassembly. Finally, we show that the ability to suppress SG formation and IFN-β gene transcription is conserved in the 2Apro of EV-A71, CV-A21, and EV-D68. Collectively, our results indicate that enterovirus 2Apro plays a key role in inhibiting innate antiviral cellular responses.IMPORTANCE Enteroviruses are important pathogens that can cause a variety of diseases in humans, including aseptic meningitis, myocarditis, hand-foot-and-mouth disease, conjunctivitis, and acute flaccid paralysis. Like many other viruses, enteroviruses must counteract antiviral cellular responses to establish an infection. It has been suggested that enterovirus proteases cleave cellular factors to perturb antiviral pathways, but the exact contribution of viral proteases 2Apro and 3Cpro remains elusive. Here, we show that 2Apro, but not 3Cpro, of all four human EV species (EV-A to EV-D) inhibits SG formation and IFN-β gene transcription. Our observations suggest that enterovirus 2Apro has a conserved function in counteracting antiviral host responses and thereby is the main enterovirus ""security protein."" Understanding the molecular mechanisms of enterovirus immune evasion strategies may help to develop countermeasures to control infections with these viruses.",A Novel Fluorescent and Bioluminescent Bireporter Influenza A Virus To Evaluate Viral Infections.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867298,Journal of virology,2019 06 10,"Studying influenza A virus (IAV) requires the use of secondary approaches to detect the presence of virus in infected cells. To overcome this problem, we and others have generated recombinant IAV expressing fluorescent or luciferase reporter genes. These foreign reporter genes can be used as valid surrogates to track the presence of virus. However, the limited capacity for incorporating foreign sequences in the viral genome forced researchers to select a fluorescent or a luciferase reporter gene, depending on the type of study. To circumvent this limitation, we engineered a novel recombinant replication-competent bireporter IAV (BIRFLU) expressing both fluorescent and luciferase reporter genes. In cultured cells, BIRFLU displayed growth kinetics comparable to those of wild-type (WT) virus and was used to screen neutralizing antibodies or compounds with antiviral activity. The expression of two reporter genes allows monitoring of viral inhibition by fluorescence or bioluminescence, overcoming the limitations associated with the use of one reporter gene as a readout. In vivo, BIRFLU effectively infected mice, and both reporter genes were detected using in vivo imaging systems (IVIS). The ability to generate recombinant IAV harboring multiple foreign genes opens unique possibilities for studying virus-host interactions and for using IAV in high-throughput screenings (HTS) to identify novel antivirals that can be incorporated into the therapeutic armamentarium to control IAV infections. Moreover, the ability to genetically manipulate the viral genome to express two foreign genes offers the possibility of developing novel influenza vaccines and the feasibility for using recombinant IAV as vaccine vectors to treat other pathogen infections.IMPORTANCE Influenza A virus (IAV) causes a human respiratory disease that is associated with significant health and economic consequences. In recent years, the use of replication-competent IAV expressing an easily traceable fluorescent or luciferase reporter protein has significantly contributed to progress in influenza research. However, researchers have been forced to select a fluorescent or a luciferase reporter gene due to the restricted capacity of the influenza viral genome for including foreign sequences. To overcome this limitation, we generated, for the first time, a recombinant replication-competent bireporter IAV (BIRFLU) that stably expresses two reporter genes (one fluorescent and one luciferase) to track IAV infections in vitro and in vivo The combination of cutting-edge techniques from molecular biology, animal research, and imaging technologies brings researchers the unique opportunity to use this new generation of reporter-expressing IAV to study viral infection dynamics in both cultured cells and animal models of viral infection.",Unique Interferon Pathway Regulation by the Andes Virus Nucleocapsid Protein Is Conferred by Phosphorylation of Serine 386.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867297,Journal of virology,2019 06 10,"Andes virus (ANDV) causes hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) and is the only hantavirus shown to spread person to person and cause a highly lethal HPS-like disease in Syrian hamsters. The unique ability of ANDV N protein to inhibit beta interferon (IFNβ) induction may contribute to its virulence and spread. Here we analyzed IFNβ regulation by ANDV N protein substituted with divergent residues from the nearly identical Maporal virus (MAPV) N protein. We found that MAPV N fails to inhibit IFNβ signaling and that replacing ANDV residues 252 to 296 with a hypervariable domain (HVD) from MAPV N prevents IFNβ regulation. In addition, changing ANDV residue S386 to the histidine present in MAPV N or the alanine present in other hantaviruses prevented ANDV N from regulating IFNβ induction. In contrast, replacing serine with phosphoserine-mimetic aspartic acid (S386D) in ANDV N robustly inhibited interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) phosphorylation and IFNβ induction. Additionally, the MAPV N protein gained the ability to inhibit IRF3 phosphorylation and IFNβ induction when ANDV HVD and H386D replaced MAPV residues. Mass spectroscopy analysis of N protein from ANDV-infected cells revealed that S386 is phosphorylated, newly classifying ANDV N as a phosphoprotein and phosphorylated S386 as a unique determinant of IFN regulation. In this context, the finding that the ANDV HVD is required for IFN regulation by S386 but dispensable for IFN regulation by D386 suggests a role for HVD in kinase recruitment and S386 phosphorylation. These findings delineate elements within the ANDV N protein that can be targeted to attenuate ANDV and suggest targeting cellular kinases as potential ANDV therapeutics.IMPORTANCE ANDV contains virulence determinants that uniquely permit it to spread person to person and cause highly lethal HPS in immunocompetent hamsters. We discovered that ANDV S386 and an ANDV-specific hypervariable domain permit ANDV N to inhibit IFN induction and that IFN regulation is directed by phosphomimetic S386D substitutions in ANDV N. In addition, MAPV N proteins containing D386 and ANDV HVD gained the ability to inhibit IFN induction. Validating these findings, mass spectroscopy analysis revealed that S386 of ANDV N protein is uniquely phosphorylated during ANDV infection. Collectively, these findings reveal new paradigms for ANDV N protein as a phosphoprotein and IFN pathway regulator and suggest new mechanisms for hantavirus regulation of cellular kinases and signaling pathways. Our findings define novel IFN-regulating virulence determinants of ANDV, identify residues that can be modified to attenuate ANDV for vaccine development, and suggest the potential for kinase inhibitors to therapeutically restrict ANDV replication.",Genomic plasticity associated with antimicrobial resistance in Vibrio cholerae.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867296,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2019 05 20,"The Bay of Bengal is known as the epicenter for seeding several devastating cholera outbreaks across the globe. Vibrio cholerae, the etiological agent of cholera, has extraordinary competency to acquire exogenous DNA by horizontal gene transfer (HGT) and adapt them into its genome for structuring metabolic processes, developing drug resistance, and colonizing the human intestine. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in V. cholerae has become a global concern. However, little is known about the identity of the resistance traits, source of AMR genes, acquisition process, and stability of the genetic elements linked with resistance genes in V. cholerae Here we present details of AMR profiles of 443 V. cholerae strains isolated from the stool samples of diarrheal patients from two regions of India. We sequenced the whole genome of multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) V. cholerae to identify AMR genes and genomic elements that harbor the resistance traits. Our genomic findings were further confirmed by proteome analysis. We also engineered the genome of V. cholerae to monitor the importance of the autonomously replicating plasmid and core genome in the resistance profile. Our findings provided insights into the genomes of recent cholera isolates and identified several acquired traits including plasmids, transposons, integrative conjugative elements (ICEs), pathogenicity islands (PIs), prophages, and gene cassettes that confer fitness to the pathogen. The knowledge generated from this study would help in better understanding of V. cholerae evolution and management of cholera disease by providing clinical guidance on preferred treatment regimens.",Using a system's equilibrium behavior to reduce its energy dissipation in nonequilibrium processes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867295,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2019 05 16,"Cells must operate far from equilibrium, utilizing and dissipating energy continuously to maintain their organization and to avoid stasis and death. However, they must also avoid unnecessary waste of energy. Recent studies have revealed that molecular machines are extremely efficient thermodynamically compared with their macroscopic counterparts. However, the principles governing the efficient out-of-equilibrium operation of molecular machines remain a mystery. A theoretical framework has been recently formulated in which a generalized friction coefficient quantifies the energetic efficiency in nonequilibrium processes. Moreover, it posits that, to minimize energy dissipation, external control should drive the system along the reaction coordinate with a speed inversely proportional to the square root of that friction coefficient. Here, we demonstrate the utility of this theory for designing and understanding energetically efficient nonequilibrium processes through the unfolding and folding of single DNA hairpins.",Defining a new nomenclature for the structures of active and inactive kinases.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867294,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2019 05 21,"Targeting protein kinases is an important strategy for intervention in cancer. Inhibitors are directed at the active conformation or a variety of inactive conformations. While attempts have been made to classify these conformations, a structurally rigorous catalog of states has not been achieved. The kinase activation loop is crucial for catalysis and begins with the conserved DFGmotif. This motif is observed in two major classes of conformations, DFGin-a set of active and inactive conformations where the Phe residue is in contact with the C-helix of the N-terminal lobe-and DFGout-an inactive form where Phe occupies the ATP site exposing the C-helix pocket. We have developed a clustering of kinase conformations based on the location of the Phe side chain (DFGin, DFGout, and DFGinter or intermediate) and the backbone dihedral angles of the sequence X-D-F, where X is the residue before the DFGmotif, and the DFG-Phe side-chain rotamer, utilizing a density-based clustering algorithm. We have identified eight distinct conformations and labeled them based on the Ramachandran regions (A, alpha; B, beta; L, left) of the XDF motif and the Phe rotamer (minus, plus, trans). Our clustering divides the DFGin group into six clusters including BLAminus, which contains active structures, and two common inactive forms, BLBplus and ABAminus. DFGout structures are predominantly in the BBAminus conformation, which is essentially required for binding type II inhibitors. The inactive conformations have specific features that make them unable to bind ATP, magnesium, and/or substrates. Our structurally intuitive nomenclature will aid in understanding the conformational dynamics of kinases and structure-based development of kinase drugs.","Diverse fate of ubiquitin chain moieties: The proximal is degraded with the target, and the distal protects the proximal from removal and recycles.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867293,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2019 04 26,"One of the enigmas in the ubiquitin (Ub) field is the requirement for a poly-Ub chain as a proteasomal targeting signal. The canonical chain appears to be longer than the distance between the two Ub-binding proteasomal receptors. Furthermore, genetic manipulation has shown that one receptor subunit is sufficient, which suggests that a single Ub can serve as a degradation signal. To shed light on this mystery, we chemically synthesized tetra-Ub, di-Ub (K48-based), and mono-Ub adducts of HA-α-globin, where the distal or proximal Ub moieties were tagged differentially with either Myc or Flag. When incubated in a crude cell extract, the distal Ub moiety in the tetra-Ub adduct was mostly removed by deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) and reconjugated to other substrates in the extract. In contrast, the proximal moiety was most likely degraded with the substrate. The efficacy of degradation was proportionate to the chain length; while tetra-Ub globin was an efficient substrate, with mono-Ub globin, we observed rapid removal of the Ub moiety with almost no degradation of the free globin. Taken together, these findings suggest that the proximal moieties are necessary for securing the association of the substrate with the proteasome along the proteolytic process, whereas the distal moieties are important in protecting the proximal moieties from premature deubiquitination. Interestingly, when the same experiment was carried out using purified 26S proteasome, mono- and tetra-Ub globin were similarly degraded, highlighting the roles of the entire repertoire of cellular DUBs in regulating the degradation of proteasomal substrates.",Growth and morphogenesis of the gastropod shell.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867292,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2019 05 21,"Gastropod shell morphologies are famously diverse but generally share a common geometry, the logarithmic coil. Variations on this morphology have been modeled mathematically and computationally but the developmental biology of shell morphogenesis remains poorly understood. Here we characterize the organization and growth patterns of the shell-secreting epithelium of the larval shell of the basket whelk Tritia (also known as Ilyanassa). Despite the larval shell's relative simplicity, we find a surprisingly complex organization of the shell margin in terms of rows and zones of cells. We examined cell division patterns with EdU incorporation assays and found two growth zones within the shell margin. In the more anterior aperture growth zone, we find that inferred division angles are biased to lie parallel to the shell edge, and these divisions occur more on the margin's left side. In the more posterior mantle epithelium growth zone, inferred divisions are significantly biased to the right, relative to the anterior-posterior axis. These growth zones, and the left-right asymmetries in cleavage patterns they display, can explain the major modes of shell morphogenesis at the level of cellular behavior. In a gastropod with a different coiling geometry, Planorbella sp., we find similar shell margin organization and growth zones as Tritia, but different left-right asymmetries than we observed in the helically coiled shell of Tritia These results indicate that differential growth patterns in the mantle edge epithelium contribute to shell shape in gastropod shells and identify cellular mechanisms that may vary to generate shell diversity in evolution.","Molecular basis of chromatin remodeling by Rhp26, a yeast CSB ortholog.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867290,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2019 06 10,"CSB/ERCC6 belongs to an orphan subfamily of SWI2/SNF2-related chromatin remodelers and plays crucial roles in gene expression, DNA damage repair, and the maintenance of genome integrity. The molecular basis of chromatin remodeling by Cockayne syndrome B protein (CSB) is not well understood. Here we investigate the molecular mechanism of chromatin remodeling by Rhp26, a Schizosaccharomyces pombe CSB ortholog. The molecular basis of chromatin remodeling and nucleosomal epitope recognition by Rhp26 is distinct from that of canonical chromatin remodelers, such as imitation switch protein (ISWI). We reveal that the remodeling activities are bidirectionally regulated by CSB-specific motifs: the N-terminal leucine-latch motif and the C-terminal coupling motif. Rhp26 remodeling activities depend mainly on H4 tails and to a lesser extent on H3 tails, but not on H2A and H2B tails. Rhp26 promotes the disruption of histone cores and the release of free DNA. Finally, we dissected the distinct contributions of two Rhp26 C-terminal regions to chromatin remodeling and DNA damage repair."

Identification of receptor and/or neurophysiological mechanisms underlying this sensitization is important, as it could promote novel therapeutic strategies to reduce tobacco use. Using an approach involving photoactivatable nicotine, we previously demonstrated that chronic nicotine (cNIC) potently enhances nAChR function in dendrites of MHb neurons. However, whether cNIC modulates downstream components of the habenulo-interpeduncular (Hb-IP) circuit is unknown. In this study, cNIC-mediated changes to Hb-IP nAChR function were examined in mouse (male and female) brain slices using molecular, electrophysiological, and optical techniques. cNIC enhanced action potential firing and modified spike waveform characteristics in MHb neurons. Nicotine uncaging revealed nAChR functional enhancement by cNIC on proximal axonal membranes. Similarly, nAChR-driven glutamate release from MHb axons was enhanced by cNIC. In IPN, the target structure of MHb axons, neuronal morphology, and nAChR expression is complex, with stronger nAChR function in the rostral subnucleus [rostral IPN (IPR)]. As in MHb, cNIC induced strong upregulation of nAChR function in IPN neurons. This, coupled with cNIC-enhanced nicotine-stimulated glutamate release, was associated with stronger depolarization responses to brief (1 ms) nicotine uncaging adjacent to IPR neurons. Together, these results indicate that chronic exposure to nicotine dramatically alters nicotinic cholinergic signaling and cell excitability in Hb-IP circuits, a key pathway involved in nicotine dependence.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT This study uncovers several neuropharmacological alterations following chronic exposure to nicotine in a key brain circuit involved in nicotine dependence. These results suggest that smokers or regular users of electronic nicotine delivery systems (i.e., ""e-cigarettes"") likely undergo sensitization of cholinergic circuitry in the Hb-IP system. Reducing the activity of Hb-IP nAChRs, either volitionally during smoking cessation or inadvertently via receptor desensitization during nicotine intake, may be a key trigger of withdrawal in nicotine dependence. Escalation of nicotine intake in smokers, or tolerance, may involve stimulation of these sensitized cholinergic pathways. Smoking cessation therapeutics are only marginally effective, and by identifying cellular/receptor mechanisms of nicotine dependence, our results take a step toward improved therapeutic approaches for this disorder.",Neural Representations of Faces Are Tuned to Eye Movements.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867260,The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,2019 06 10,"Eye movements provide a functional signature of how human vision is achieved. Many recent studies have consistently reported robust idiosyncratic visual sampling strategies during face recognition. Whether these interindividual differences are mirrored by idiosyncratic neural responses remains unknown. To this aim, we first tracked eye movements of male and female observers during face recognition. Additionally, for every observer we obtained an objective index of neural face discrimination through EEG that was recorded while they fixated different facial information. We found that foveation of facial features fixated longer during face recognition elicited stronger neural face discrimination responses across all observers. This relationship occurred independently of interindividual differences in preferential facial information sampling (e.g., eye vs mouth lookers), and started as early as the first fixation. Our data show that eye movements play a functional role during face processing by providing the neural system with the information that is diagnostic to a specific observer. The effective processing of identity involves idiosyncratic, rather than universal face representations.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT When engaging in face recognition, observers deploy idiosyncratic fixation patterns to sample facial information. Whether these individual differences concur with idiosyncratic face-sensitive neural responses remains unclear. To address this issue, we recorded observers' fixation patterns, as well as their neural face discrimination responses elicited during fixation of 10 different locations on the face, corresponding to different types of facial information. Our data reveal a clear interplay between individuals' face-sensitive neural responses and their idiosyncratic eye-movement patterns during identity processing, which emerges as early as the first fixation. Collectively, our findings favor the existence of idiosyncratic, rather than universal face representations."

In this study, we report that in both the cell types, OmpU-induced proinflammatory responses involve activation of MAPKs (p38 and JNK). Interestingly, we observed that in OmpU-treated macrophages, p38 activation is TLR2 dependent, but JNK activation happens through a separate pathway involving reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation by NADPH oxidase complex and mitochondrial ROS. Further, we observed that OmpU-mediated mitochondrial ROS generation probably depends on OmpU translocation to mitochondria and NADPH oxidase-mediated ROS production is due to activation of scavenger receptor CD36. For the first time, to our knowledge, we are reporting that a Gram-negative bacterial protein can activate CD36 as a pattern recognition receptor. Additionally, we found that in OmpU-treated monocytes, both JNK and p38 activation is linked to the TLR2 activation only. Therefore, the ability of macrophages to employ multiple receptors such as TLR2 and CD36 to recognize a single ligand, as in this case OmpU, probably explains the very basic nature of macrophages being more proinflammatory than monocytes.",Distinctive Effects of GM-CSF and M-CSF on Proliferation and Polarization of Two Major Pulmonary Macrophage Populations.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867240,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2019 04 26,"GM-CSF is required for alveolar macrophage (AM) development shortly after birth and for maintenance of AM functions throughout life, whereas M-CSF is broadly important for macrophage differentiation and self-renewal. However, the comparative actions of GM-CSF and M-CSF on AMs are incompletely understood. Interstitial macrophages (IMs) constitute a second major pulmonary macrophage population. However, unlike AMs, IM responses to CSFs are largely unknown. Proliferation, phenotypic identity, and M1/M2 polarization are important attributes of all macrophage populations, and in this study, we compared their modulation by GM-CSF and M-CSF in murine primary AMs and IMs. CSFs increased the proliferation capacity and upregulated antiapoptotic gene expression in AMs but not IMs. GM-CSF, but not M-CSF, reinforced the cellular identity, as identified by surface markers, of both cell types. GM-CSF, but not M-CSF, increased the expression of both M1 and M2 markers exclusively in AMs. Finally, CSFs enhanced the IFN-γ- and IL-4-induced polarization ability of AMs but not IMs. These first (to our knowledge) data comparing effects on the two pulmonary macrophage populations demonstrate that the activating actions of GM-CSF and M-CSF on primary AMs are not conserved in primary IMs.","4-1BB Regulates Effector CD8 T Cell Accumulation in the Lung Tissue through a TRAF1-, mTOR-, and Antigen-Dependent Mechanism to Enhance Tissue-Resident Memory T Cell Formation during Respiratory Influenza Infection.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867239,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2019 04 09,"The TNFR superfamily member 4-1BB is important in the establishment of tissue-resident memory T cells (Trm) in the lung tissue following influenza infection. Moreover, supraphysiological boosting of 4-1BB in the airways during the boost phase of a prime-boost immunization regimen increases the long-lived Trm population, correlating with increased protection against heterotypic challenge. However, little is known about how 4-1BB contributes to the establishment of the lung Trm population. In this study, we show that effects of 4-1BB on lung Trm accumulation are already apparent at the effector stage, suggesting that the major role of 4-1BB in Trm formation is to allow persistence of CD8 T effector cells in the lung as they transition to Trm. Using supraphysiological stimulation of 4-1BB in the boost phase of a prime-boost immunization, we show that the effect of 4-1BB on Trm generation requires local delivery of both Ag and costimulation, is inhibited by rapamycin treatment during secondary CD8 effector T cell expansion, and is dependent on the signaling adaptor TRAF1. The decrease in lung Trm following early rapamycin treatment is accompanied by increased circulating memory T cells, as well as fewer effectors, suggesting a role for mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) in the formation of Trm through effects on the accumulation of effector precursors. Taken together, these data point to an important role for 4-1BB, TRAF1, and mTOR in the persistence of CD8 effector T cells in the lung parenchyma, thereby allowing the transition to Trm.",Essential Role of NADPH Oxidase-Dependent Production of Reactive Oxygen Species in Maintenance of Sustained B Cell Receptor Signaling and B Cell Proliferation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867238,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2019 04 23,"Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are not only toxic substances inducing oxidative stress but also play a role as a second messenger in signal transduction through various receptors. Previously, B cell activation was shown to involve prolonged ROS production induced by ligation of BCR. However, the mechanisms for ROS production and ROS-mediated activation in B cells are still poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrate that BCR ligation induces biphasic ROS production in both mouse spleen B cells and the mouse B cell line BAL17; transient and modest ROS production is followed by sustained and robust ROS production at 2-6 h after BCR ligation. ROS production in the late phase but not in the early phase augments activation of signaling pathways, such as the NF-κB and PI3K pathways, and is essential for B cell proliferation. ROS production in the late phase appears to be mediated by NADPH oxidases (NOXes) because prolonged ROS production is inhibited by various NOX inhibitors, including the specific inhibitor VAS2870. BCR ligation-induced ROS production is also inhibited by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated deletion of either the Cyba gene encoding p22phox, the regulator of NOX1-4 required for their activation, or NOX3, whereas ROS production is not affected by double deficiency of the DUOXA1 and DUOXA2 genes essential for the activation of the NOX isoforms DUOX1 and DUOX2. These results indicate that NOXes play a crucial role in sustained but not early BCR signaling and suggest an essential role of NOX-dependent sustained BCR signaling in B cell activation.",Candida auris Isolates of the Southern Asian and South African Lineages Exhibit Different Phenotypic and Antifungal Susceptibility Profiles In Vitro.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867237,Journal of clinical microbiology,2019 06 10,"Candida auris is a serious nosocomial health risk, with widespread outbreaks occurring in hospitals worldwide. Sequence analyses of outbreak isolates revealed that C. auris has simultaneously emerged as four distinct continentally restricted clonal lineages. We previously reported multiple independent introductions of C. auris isolates from at least three of these lineages (the Southern Asia, South African, and Japanese/Korean lineages) into hospitals across the United Kingdom and that isolates circulating in the United Kingdom displayed two different cell phenotypes which correlated with differences in virulence in Galleria mellonella wax moths. Here, we compared the phenotypic characteristics and antifungal susceptibilities of isolates representative of the three geographic clades circulating in the United Kingdom. Isolates of the South African and Japanese/Korean lineages, but not those of the Southern Asian lineage, grew well on media containing actidione. However, unlike Southern Asian lineage isolates, they were unable to produce even rudimentary pseudohyphae in culture. Importantly, although all isolates were fluconazole resistant in vitro, fluconazole and voriconazole exhibited significantly higher MICs against isolates of the South African lineage than against isolates of the Southern Asian lineage. A similar trend was seen with minimum fungicidal concentrations (MFCs), with higher MFCs of the triazole antifungal agents being seen for the South African lineage isolates. Finally, the formation of large cellular aggregates was seen only with isolates of the South African and Japanese/Korean lineages, which correlates with the reduced virulence observed previously in Galleria wax moths inoculated with such isolates. Intriguingly, aggregation could be reversibly induced in isolates of the Southern Asian lineage by exposure to triazole and echinocandin antifungals but not by exposure to amphotericin B or flucytosine.",To Lump or To Split: Does Strain Lineage for Clostridioides difficile Matter?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867236,Journal of clinical microbiology,2019 06 10,"Since 2001, numerous descriptive ecological studies of Clostridioides difficile infections (CDI) have identified a single lineage (BI/NAP1/027) associated with the epidemics of CDI, increased severity of CDI, and increased likelihood of incident CDI to become recurrent. Establishing causality between the clinical severity and outcomes for CDI and the lineages of the infecting strains, however, has proved elusive, with many conflicting results in previous observational studies. In this issue of the Journal of Clinical Microbiology, J. R. Garneau, C. N. Abou Chakra, L.-C. Fortier, A.-C. Labbé, et al. (J Clin Microbiol 57:e01724-18, 2019, https://doi.org/10.1128/JCM.01724-18) performed multilocus variable-number tandem-repeat analysis (MLVA) on 450 isolates from epidemic strain CDI arising in 10 Canadian centers during a previously well-described epidemic to assess the hypothesis that subpopulations of this lineage are associated with adverse clinical outcomes. The authors' key finding, however, was that MLVA genotyping grouped infections closely with associated hospital centers; CDI severity was not associated with any particular sublineage by MLVA. While the study does not support any causal inferences about strain-specific virulence of CDI, it does highlight the power of MLVA, a genotyping tool that remains valuable in tracking the geospatial transmission dynamics of CDI.",EDTA-Modified Carbapenem Inactivation Method: a Phenotypic Method for Detecting Metallo-β-Lactamase-Producing Enterobacteriaceae.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867235,Journal of clinical microbiology,2019 06 10,"The increase in the prevalence and impact of infections caused by carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae is a global health concern.

Here, we describe the development and evaluation of the EDTA-modified carbapenem inactivation method (eCIM), an assay for discriminating between serine- and metal-dependent (i.e., metallo-β-lactamases [MBLs]) carbapenemases when used in conjunction with the modified carbapenem inactivation method (mCIM).

Genome-wide analysis of GR binding and gene regulation has shown that the likelihood of GR-dependent regulation increases with decreased distance of its binding to the transcriptional start site of a gene. To test if we can adopt this knowledge to expand the repertoire of GR target genes, we used CRISPR/Cas-mediated homology-directed repair to add a single GR-binding site directly upstream of the transcriptional start site of each of four genes. To our surprise, we found that the addition of a single GR-binding site can be enough to convert a gene into a GR target. The gain of GR-dependent regulation was observed for two of four genes analyzed and coincided with acquired GR binding at the introduced binding site. However, the gene-specific gain of GR-dependent regulation could not be explained by obvious differences in chromatin accessibility between converted genes and their non-converted counterparts. Furthermore, by introducing GR-binding sequences with different nucleotide compositions, we show that activation can be facilitated by distinct sequences without obvious differences in activity between the GR-binding sequence variants we tested. The approach to use genome engineering to build genomic response elements facilitates the generation of cell lines with tailored repertoires of GR-responsive genes and a framework to test and refine our understanding of the cis-regulatory logic of gene regulation by testing if engineered response elements behave as predicted.",Breastfeeding initiation and duration in Chile: understanding the social and health determinants.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867222,Journal of epidemiology and community health,2019 06 11,"Given the support for the numerous benefits of breastfeeding, a better understanding of social and health determinants is necessary, particularly in under-researched populations.

Some of these exchanges depend on expression of the primary cilium on nontransformed cell populations, as extracellular ligands including Sonic Hedgehog (SHH), PDGFRα, and others function through receptors spatially localized to cilia. Cell ciliation is regulated by proteins that are themselves therapeutic targets. We investigated whether kinase inhibitors of clinical interest influence ciliation and signaling by proteins with ciliary receptors in cancer and other cilia-relevant disorders, such as polycystic kidney disease (PKD).Experimental Design: We screened a library of clinical and preclinical kinase inhibitors, identifying drugs that either prevented or induced ciliary disassembly. Specific bioactive protein targets of the drugs were identified by mRNA depletion. Mechanism of action was defined, and activity of select compounds investigated.Results: We identified multiple kinase inhibitors not previously linked to control of ciliation, including sunitinib, erlotinib, and an inhibitor of the innate immune pathway kinase, IRAK4. For all compounds, activity was mediated through regulation of Aurora-A (AURKA) activity. Drugs targeting cilia influenced proximal cellular responses to SHH and PDGFRα. In vivo, sunitinib durably limited ciliation and cilia-related biological activities in renal cells, renal carcinoma cells, and PKD cysts. Extended analysis of IRAK4 defined a subset of innate immune signaling effectors potently affecting ciliation.Conclusions: These results suggest a paradigm by which targeted drugs may have unexpected off-target effects in heterogeneous cell populations in vivo via control of a physical platform for receipt of extracellular ligands.",Combined Inhibition of STAT3 and DNA Repair in Palbociclib-Resistant ER-Positive Breast Cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867218,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,2019 05 22,"Purpose: Cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6) inhibitors are currently used in combination with endocrine therapy to treat advanced hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer. Although this treatment doubles time to progression compared with endocrine therapy alone, about 25%-35% of patients do not respond, and almost all patients eventually acquire resistance. Discerning the mechanisms of resistance to CDK4/6 inhibition is crucial in devising alternative treatment strategies.Experimental Design: Palbociclib-resistant cells (MCF-7 and T47D) were generated in a step-wise dose-escalading fashion. Whole-exome sequencing, genome-wide expression analysis, and proteomic analysis were performed in both resistant and parental (sensitive) cells. Pathway alteration was assessed mechanistically and pharmacologically. Biomarkers of altered pathways were examined in tumor samples from patients with palbociclib-treated breast cancer whose disease progressed while on treatment.Results: Palbociclib-resistant cells are cross-resistant to other CDK4/6 inhibitors and are also resistant to endocrine therapy (estrogen receptor downregulation). IL6/STAT3 pathway is induced, whereas DNA repair and estrogen receptor pathways are downregulated in the resistant cells. Combined inhibition of STAT3 and PARP significantly increased cell death in the resistant cells. Matched tumor samples from patients with breast cancer who progressed on palbociclib were examined for deregulation of estrogen receptor, DNA repair, and IL6/STAT3 signaling, and results revealed that these pathways are all altered as compared with the pretreatment tumor samples.Conclusions: Palbociclib resistance induces endocrine resistance, estrogen receptor downregulation, and alteration of IL6/STAT3 and DNA damage response pathways in cell lines and patient samples. Targeting IL6/STAT3 activity and DNA repair deficiency using a specific STAT3 inhibitor combined with a PARP inhibitor could effectively treat acquired resistance to palbociclib.","Sustainability and Scale of the Saving Mothers, Giving Life Approach in Uganda and Zambia.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867217,"Global health, science and practice",2019 06 10,"Saving Mothers, Giving Life (SMGL) significantly reduced maternal and perinatal mortality in Uganda and Zambia by using a district health systems strengthening approach to address the key delays women and newborns face in receiving quality, timely, and appropriate medical care.

Loss of centrosomes can impair the ability of some cells to properly conduct mitotic division, leading to chromosomal instability, cell stress, and aneuploidy. Multiple aspects of the cellular response to mitotic error associated with centrosome loss appear to involve activation of JNK signaling. To further characterize the transcriptional effects of centrosome loss, we compared gene expression profiles of wild-type and acentrosomal cells from Drosophila wing imaginal discs. We found elevation of expression of JNK target genes, which we verified at the protein level. Consistent with this, the upregulated gene set showed significant enrichment for the AP-1 consensus DNA-binding sequence. We also found significant elevation in expression of genes regulating redox balance. Based on those findings, we examined oxidative stress after centrosome loss, revealing that acentrosomal wing cells have significant increases in reactive oxygen species (ROS). We then performed a candidate genetic screen and found that one of the genes upregulated in acentrosomal cells, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, plays an important role in buffering acentrosomal cells against increased ROS and helps protect those cells from cell death. Our data and other recent studies have revealed a complex network of signaling pathways, transcriptional programs, and cellular processes that epithelial cells use to respond to stressors, like mitotic errors, to help limit cell damage and maintain normal tissue development.",Progression of Meiosis Is Coordinated by the Level and Location of MAPK Activation Via OGR-2 in Caenorhabditis elegans.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867196,Genetics,2019 06 10,"During meiosis, a series of evolutionarily conserved events allow for reductional chromosome division, which is required for sexual reproduction. Although individual meiotic processes have been extensively studied, we currently know far less about how meiosis is regulated and coordinated. In the Caenorhabditis elegans gonad, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling drives oogenesis while undergoing spatial activation and deactivation waves. However, it is currently unclear how MAPK activation is governed and how it facilitates the progression of oogenesis. Here, we show that the oocyte and germline-related 2 (ogr-2) gene affects proper progression of oogenesis. Complete deletion of ogr-2 results in delayed meiotic entry and late spatial onset of double-strand break repair. Elevated levels of apoptosis are observed in this mutant, independent of the meiotic canonical checkpoints; however, they are dependent on the MAPK terminal member MPK-1/ERK. MPK-1 activation is elevated in diplotene in ogr-2 mutants and its aberrant spatial activation correlates with stages where meiotic progression defects are evident. Deletion of ogr-2 significantly reduces the expression of lip-1, a phosphatase reported to repress MPK-1, which is consistent with OGR-2 localization at chromatin in germ cells. We suggest that OGR-2 modulates the expression of lip-1 to promote the timely progression of meiosis through MPK-1 spatial deactivation.",NMR- and MD simulation-based structural characterization of the membrane-associating FATC domain of ataxia telangiectasia mutated.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867195,The Journal of biological chemistry,2019 05 07,"The Ser/Thr protein kinase ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) plays an important role in the DNA damage response, signaling in response to redox signals, the control of metabolic processes, and mitochondrial homeostasis. ATM localizes to the nucleus and at the plasma membrane, mitochondria, peroxisomes, and other cytoplasmic vesicular structures. It has been shown that the C-terminal FATC domain of human ATM (hATMfatc) can interact with a range of membrane mimetics and may thereby act as a membrane-anchoring unit. Here, NMR structural and 15N relaxation data, NMR data using spin-labeled micelles, and MD simulations of micelle-associated hATMfatc revealed that it binds the micelle by a dynamic assembly of three helices with many residues of hATMfatc located in the headgroup region. We observed that none of the three helices penetrates the micelle deeply or makes significant tertiary contacts to the other helices. NMR-monitored interaction experiments with hATMfatc variants in which two conserved aromatic residues (Phe3049 and Trp3052) were either individually or both replaced by alanine disclosed that the double substitution does not abrogate the interaction with micelles and bicelles at the high concentrations at which these aggregates are typically used, but impairs interactions with small unilamellar vesicles, usually used at much lower lipid concentrations and considered a better mimetic for natural membranes. We conclude that the observed dynamic structure of micelle-associated hATMfatc may enable it to interact with differently composed membranes or membrane-associated interaction partners and thereby regulate ATM's kinase activity. Moreover, the FATC domain of ATM may function as a membrane-anchoring unit for other biomolecules.",The hepatitis C virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase directs incoming nucleotides to its active site through magnesium-dependent dynamics within its F motif.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867194,The Journal of biological chemistry,2019 05 16,"RNA viruses synthesize new genomes in the infected host thanks to dedicated, virally-encoded RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRps). As such, these enzymes are prime targets for antiviral therapy, as has recently been demonstrated for hepatitis C virus (HCV). However, peculiarities in the architecture and dynamics of RdRps raise fundamental questions about access to their active site during RNA polymerization. Here, we used molecular modeling and molecular dynamics simulations, starting from the available crystal structures of HCV NS5B in ternary complex with template-primer duplexes and nucleotides, to address the question of ribonucleotide entry into the active site of viral RdRp. Tracing the possible passage of incoming UTP or GTP through the RdRp-specific entry tunnel, we found two successive checkpoints that regulate nucleotide traffic to the active site. We observed that a magnesium-bound nucleotide first binds next to the tunnel entry, and interactions with the triphosphate moiety orient it such that its base moiety enters first. Dynamics of RdRp motifs F1 + F3 then allow the nucleotide to interrogate the RNA template base prior to nucleotide insertion into the active site. These dynamics are finely regulated by a second magnesium dication, thus coordinating the entry of a magnesium-bound nucleotide with shuttling of the second magnesium necessary for the two-metal ion catalysis. The findings of our work suggest that at least some of these features are general to viral RdRps and provide further details on the original nucleotide selection mechanism operating in RdRps of RNA viruses.",Readmissions to the ICU Among Children With Tracheostomies Placed After Cardiac Arrest.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867193,Hospital pediatrics,2019 04 02,Describe clinical outcomes and risk factors for ICU readmissions in a cohort of children who underwent tracheostomy placement after cardiac arrest.

In this review, we provide an overview of the plethora of studies that have investigated factors that influence humoral and cellular vaccine responses in humans. These include intrinsic host factors (such as age, sex, genetics, and comorbidities), perinatal factors (such as gestational age, birth weight, feeding method, and maternal factors), and extrinsic factors (such as preexisting immunity, microbiota, infections, and antibiotics). Further, environmental factors (such as geographic location, season, family size, and toxins), behavioral factors (such as smoking, alcohol consumption, exercise, and sleep), and nutritional factors (such as body mass index, micronutrients, and enteropathy) also influence how individuals respond to vaccines. Moreover, vaccine factors (such as vaccine type, product, adjuvant, and dose) and administration factors (schedule, site, route, time of vaccination, and coadministered vaccines and other drugs) are also important. An understanding of all these factors and their impacts in the design of vaccine studies and decisions on vaccination schedules offers ways to improve vaccine immunogenicity and efficacy.",Challenges for the Clinical Development of PI3K Inhibitors: Strategies to Improve Their Impact in Solid Tumors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867161,Cancer discovery,2019 04 04,"The PI3K pathway is mutated and aberrantly activated in many cancers and plays a central role in tumor cell proliferation and survival, making it a rational therapeutic target. Until recently, however, results from clinical trials with PI3K inhibitors in solid tumors have been largely disappointing. Here, we describe several factors that have limited the success of these agents, including the weak driver oncogenic activity of mutant PI3K, suboptimal patient selection in trials, drug-related toxicities, feedback upregulation of compensatory mechanisms when PI3K is blocked, increased insulin production upon PI3Kα inhibition, lack of mutant-specific inhibitors, and a relative scarcity of studies using combinations with PI3K antagonists. We also suggest strategies to improve the impact of these agents in solid tumors. Despite these challenges, we are optimistic that isoform-specific PI3K inhibitors, particularly in combination with other agents, may be valuable in treating appropriately selected patients with PI3K-dependent tumors. SIGNIFICANCE: Despite the modest clinical activity of PI3K inhibitors in solid tumors, there is an increasing understanding of the factors that may have limited their success. Strategies to ameliorate drug-related toxicities, use of rational combinations with PI3K antagonists, development of mutant-selective PI3K inhibitors, and better patient selection should improve the success of these targeted agents against solid tumors.",ADC Could Benefit Some with Breast Cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867160,Cancer discovery,2019 05 02,"Results from a phase I/II trial suggest that an antibody-drug conjugate, sacituzumab govitecan, is active against refractory, metastatic triple-negative breast cancer.

In the absence of large randomised clinical trials, clinical practice is leaning towards evidence reported in other populations. Due to the greater risk of major bleeding associated with oral anticoagulation using a vitamin-K antagonist (VKA), antiplatelet therapy (APT) may be considered as the first-line treatment of patients undergoing TAVI. Overall, single rather than dual APT is preferred. However, dual APT should be considered in patients with a recent acute coronary syndrome (ie, within 6 months), complex coronary stenting, large aortic arch atheromas or previous non-cardioembolic stroke. Monotherapy with VKA should be considered if concomitant atrial fibrillation or any other indication for long-term oral anticoagulation is present. APT on top of VKA seems only reasonable in patients with recent acute coronary syndrome, extensive or recent coronary stenting or large aortic arch atheromas. A direct-acting oral anticoagulant may be considered if oral anticoagulation is indicated in the absence of contraindications. Initiation of VKA is indicated in clinical valve thrombosis, for example, with high transvalvular gradient, whereas the role of VKA in the case of subclinical leaflet thrombosis is currently uncertain.",Joint association of urinary sodium and potassium excretion with cardiovascular events and mortality: prospective cohort study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867146,BMJ (Clinical research ed.),2019 04 22,"To evaluate the joint association of sodium and potassium urinary excretion (as surrogate measures of intake) with cardiovascular events and mortality, in the context of current World Health Organization recommendations for daily intake (<2.0 g sodium, >3.5 g potassium) in adults.",Benefits and harms of spinal manipulative therapy for the treatment of chronic low back pain: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867144,BMJ (Clinical research ed.),2019 04 16,To assess the benefits and harms of spinal manipulative therapy (SMT) for the treatment of chronic low back pain.,Modulation of TAP-dependent antigen compartmentalization during human monocyte-to-DC differentiation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867143,Blood advances,2019 03 29,"Dendritic cells (DCs) take up antigen in the periphery, migrate to secondary lymphoid organs, and present processed antigen fragments to adaptive immune cells and thus prime antigen-specific immunity. During local inflammation, recirculating monocytes are recruited from blood to the inflamed tissue, where they differentiate to macrophages and DCs. In this study, we found that monocytes showed high transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP)-dependent peptide compartmentalization and that after antigen pulsing, they were not able to efficiently stimulate antigen-specific T lymphocytes. Nevertheless, upon in vitro differentiation to monocyte-derived DCs, TAP-dependent peptide compartmentalization as well as surface major histocompatibility complex I turnover decreased and the cells efficiently restimulated T lymphocytes. Although TAP-dependent peptide compartmentalization decreased during DC differentiation, TAP expression levels increased. Furthermore, TAP relocated from early endosomes in monocytes to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and lysosomal compartments in DCs. Collectively, these data are compatible with the model that during monocyte-to-DC differentiation, the subcellular relocation of TAP and the regulation of its activity assure spatiotemporal separation of local antigen uptake and processing by monocytes and efficient T-lymphocyte stimulation by DCs.",Olaratumab combined with doxorubicin and ifosfamide overcomes individual doxorubicin and olaratumab resistance of an undifferentiated soft-tissue sarcoma in a PDOX mouse model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867142,Cancer letters,2019 03 31,"Olaratumab (OLA), a monoclonal antibody against platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRα), has recently been used against soft-tissue sarcoma (STS) combined with doxorubicin (DOX), with limited efficacy. The goal of the present study was to determine the efficacy of OLA in combination with DOX and ifosfamide (IFO) on STS. Undifferentiated soft-tissue sarcoma (USTS) from a striated muscle of a patient was grown orthotopically in the right biceps femoris muscle of nude mice to establish USTS patient-derived orthotopic xenograft (PDOX) model. USTS PDOX tumors were treated with OLA alone, DOX alone, DOX combined with IFO, OLA combined with DOX or IFO, and OLA combined with DOX and IFO. Tumor size and body weight were measured during the 14 days of treatment. Tumor growth was arrested by OLA combined with DOX and IFO. Tumors treated with OLA combined with DOX and IFO had the most necrosis. The present study demonstrates the power of the PDOX model to identify the novel effective treatment strategy of the combination of OLA, DOX and IFO for soft-tissue sarcomas."

This differentiation is maintained by cell-cell interactions through trophic factors such as brain-derived-neurotrophic-factor (BDNF). However, differentiation is impaired when white matter injury occurs in a chronic cerebral hypoperfusion model. Thus, we examined the effects of the interaction between astrocyte and oligodendrocyte lineage cells on myelination regarding the mechanism of impairment. A microcoil was applied to the bilateral common carotid arteries in male C57BL/6 mice as an in vivo cerebral chronic hypoperfusion model (BCAS model). A nonlethal concentration of CoCl2 was added to the primary cell culture from the postnatal rat cortex and incubated in vitro. White matter injury progressed in the BCAS model as myelin decreased. The numbers of OPCs and astrocytes increased after the operation, whereas that of OLGs decreased at day 28. BDNF continuously decreased until day 28. Differentiation was disrupted under the stressed conditions in the cell culture, but improved after administration of astrocyte-conditioned medium containing BDNF. Astrocytes with BDNF underwent differentiation, but differentiation was impaired under the stressed conditions due to the reduction of BDNF. We examined S100B regarding the mechanism of impairment. S100B is mainly expressed by mature astrocytes, and has neuroprotective and neurotoxic effects inside and outside of cells. GFAP-positive astrocytes increased in the corpus callosum in the BCAS model, whereas the number of mature astrocytes continued to decrease, resulting in reduced BDNF. The reduction in mature astrocytes due to the discharge of S100B in ischemic conditions caused the reduction in BDNF.",Exercise Reveals Proline Dehydrogenase as a Potential Target in Heart Failure.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867130,Progress in cardiovascular diseases,2019 04 16,"The benefits of physical activity in cardiovascular diseases have long been appreciated. However, the molecular mechanisms that trigger and sustain the cardiac benefits of exercise are poorly understood, and it is anticipated that unveiling these mechanisms will identify novel therapeutic targets. In search of these mechanisms we took advantage of unbiased RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) technology to discover cardiac gene targets whose expression is disrupted in heart failure (HF) and rescued by exercise in a rat model. Upon exhaustive validation in a separate rat cohort (qPCR) and human datasets, we shortlisted 16 targets for a cell-based screening, aiming to evaluate whether targeted disruption of these genes with silencing RNA would affect the abundance of a CVD biomarker (BNP, B-type natriuretic peptide) in human cardiomyocytes. Overall, these experiments showed that Proline Dehydrogenase (PRODH) expression is reduced in human failing hearts, rescued by exercise in a rat model of HF, and its targeted knockdown increases BNP expression in human cardiomyocytes. On the other hand, overexpression of PRODH increases the abundance of metabolism-related gene transcripts, and PRODH appears to be crucial to sustain normal mitochondrial function and maintenance of ATP levels in human cardiomyocytes in a hypoxic environment, as well as for redox homeostasis in both normoxic and hypoxic conditions. Altogether our findings show that PRODH is a novel molecular target of exercise in failing hearts and highlight its role in cardiomyocyte physiology, thereby proposing PRODH as a potential experimental target for gene therapy in HF.",Preparation of cubic-shaped sorafenib-loaded nanocomposite using well-defined poly(vinyl alcohol alt-propenylene) copolymer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867128,International journal of pharmaceutics,2019 04 12,"Vinyl alcohol (VA) copolymers having fine tunable polarities are emerging materials in drug delivery applications.

Sorafenib anticancer drug was embedded into PVA-5 (C/OH = 5 ratio) nanoparticles by nanoprecipitation resulting in nanoparticles exhibiting unusual cubic shape. The sorafenib-loaded nanocomposites showed continuous release during a day and concentration-dependant cytotoxicity on HT-29 cancer cells.

We recently showed that encephalitogenic lymphocytes are recruited to the sites of active demyelination induced by cuprizone. Here, we investigated whether cuprizone-induced oligodendrocyte and myelin pathology is sufficient to trigger peripheral immune cell recruitment into the forebrain. We show that early cuprizone-induced white matter lesions display a striking similarity to early MS lesions, i.e., oligodendrocyte degeneration, microglia activation and absence of severe lymphocyte infiltration. Such early cuprizone lesions are sufficient to trigger peripheral immune cell recruitment secondary to subsequent EAE (experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis) induction. The lesions are characterized by discontinuation of the perivascular glia limitans, focal axonal damage, and perivascular astrocyte pathology. Time course studies showed that the severity of cuprizone-induced lesions positively correlates with the extent of peripheral immune cell recruitment. Furthermore, results of genome-wide array analyses suggest that moesin is integral for early microglia activation in cuprizone and MS lesions. This study underpins the significance of brain-intrinsic degenerative cascades for immune cell recruitment and, in consequence, MS lesion formation.",Laparoscopic versus open gastrectomy for high-risk patients with gastric cancer: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867126,"International journal of surgery (London, England)",2019 05 07,It is still remains unclear whether high-risk patients with gastric cancer can benefit from the application of laparoscopic gastrectomy (LG).

This work describes the in vitro effects of crude venom and purified proteins from snake Crotalus durissus terrificus as they affect coagulation factors of clotting pathways. Coagulant and/or anticoagulant activities of crude venom, and purified proteins were all analyzed directly in human plasma. Clots formed by crude venom and Gyroxin presented as flexible hyaline masses in punctiform distribution. Clot formation time evaluation of isolated proteins with PT and APTT assays made it possible to infer that these proteins interfere in all coagulation pathways. However, regarding ophidism by C. d. terrificus, Gyroxin acts directly, breaking down fibrinogen to fibrin and increasing the amount plasminogen activator, which results in the formation of thrombi. Crotoxin complex, Crotoxin A and Crotoxin B proteins can act in prothrombinase complex formation; Crotoxin B can inhibit prothrombinase complex formation by direct interaction with Factor Xa. Crotamine interacts with negatively charged regions of differing coagulation factors in all coagulation pathways, and possesses a whole set of activities causing dysfunction, activation and/or inhibition of natural anticoagulants and disturbing hemostasis.",Mammalian Hippo kinase pathway is downregulated by BCL-2 via protein degradation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867124,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2019 03 25,"Mammalian ste20-like kinase (MST) signaling pathway plays a significant part in control of cell death and cell cycle. It was originally found as Hippo pathway in Drosophila and composed of MST kinase and Salvador-1 (SAV1), a scaffold protein. In mammalian cells, MST pathway induces cell-cycle exit and apoptosis in response to various signals. BCL-2, an anti-apoptotic protein, inhibits cell death and plays an important part in tumorigenesis. In the present report, we present evidence showing that BCL-2 is a new regulator of MST pathway. First, protein levels of MST2 and SAV1 were reduced significantly by co-expression of BCL-2. Physical interaction of BCL-2 with SAV1 was correlated with proteasomal degradation of SAV1 and MST2 proteins. In SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell line expressing a high level of BCL-2 but low levels of MST2 and SAV1, siRNA-induced knockdown of BCL-2 restored the expression of MST2 and SAV1. Inhibition of BCL-2 with BAD or ABT-737, a BCL-2 inhibitor, reversed its effect on MST2 and SAV1 proteins. ABT737 increased HEK293 cell death significantly when both MST2 and SAV1 were co-expressed. These results suggest that cancer cells may avoid cell death through enhanced expression of BCL-2 which down-regulates the pro-apoptotic MST pathway.",The genome-wide landscape of small insertion and deletion mutations in Monopterus albus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867123,Journal of genetics and genomics = Yi chuan xue bao,2019 04 15,"Insertion and deletion (indel) mutations, which can trigger single nucleotide substitutions on the flanking regions of genes, may generate abundant materials for disease defense, reproduction, species survival and evolution. However, genetic and evolutionary mechanisms of indels remain elusive. We establish a comparative genome-transcriptome-alignment approach for a large-scale identification of indels in Monopterus population. Over 2000 indels in 1738 indel genes, including 1-21 bp deletions and 1-15 bp insertions, were detected. Each indel gene had ∼1.1 deletions/insertions, and 2-4 alleles in population. Frequencies of deletions were prominently higher than those of insertions on both genome and population levels. Most of the indels led to in frame mutations with multiples of three and majorly occurred in non-domain regions, indicating functional constraint or tolerance of the indels. All indel genes showed higher expression levels than non-indel genes during sex reversal. Slide window analysis of global expression levels in gonads showed a significant positive correlation with indel density in the genome. Moreover, indel genes were evolutionarily conserved and evolved slowly compared to non-indel genes.

We also injected nanoceria labelled with fluorescein isothiocianate in order to analyze their persistence after a single administration in a damaged retina and to investigate how long they both maintain their neuroprotective properties and where they localize in the retina. We demonstrated that after a single intravitreal injection, nanoceria remained in the retina for a long time and retained their neuroprotective properties. All these data form excellent bases for future clinical applications."
