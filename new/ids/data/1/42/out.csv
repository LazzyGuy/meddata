Clinical haematology,2019 06 10,"Autoimmune diseases (ADs) are associated with an increased risk not only of lymphoproliferative disorders but also of myeloid malignancies. The excess risk of myelodysplastic syndromes and/or acute myeloid leukemia is observed across several AD types, including systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disorders, multiple sclerosis, among others. The risk of developing myeloid neoplasms (MNs) is dependent on several variables, including the specific AD type, chronicity and severity of the AD, type and duration of exposure of disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs or cytotoxics/immunosuppressives, and genetic predisposition risk. Putative triggering factors linking AD to elevated MN risk include AD-directed medications, shared genetic susceptibilities between the two disease entities, and chronic immune stimulation or bone marrow infiltration by the AD. Molecular mechanisms underpinning leukemogenesis remain largely speculative and warrant further investigation. Leukemias arising in patients with AD are not always 'therapy-related' in that MNs may develop in certain AD subtypes even among patients with no prior therapy exposure. Only a few studies have attempted to determine factors associated with MN development in AD but failed to demonstrate consistent characteristic clinical or paraclinical features. These reports have failed to demonstrate a clear correlation between individual agent exposure and subsequent leukemia development due to the low rates of therapy exposure compounded by the rarity of MN occurrence. Notwithstanding, the leukemogenic potential is best documented with agents such as azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, and mitoxantrone; this risk of MN development does not appear to be shared by biologic approaches such as anti-tumor necrosis factors-alpha inhibitors. In this article, we discuss plausible biologic mechanisms underlying MN pathogenesis in AD and review the data available on the development of MNs in patients with AD.",Therapy-associated leukemic transformation in myeloproliferative neoplasms - What do we know?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927977,Best practice & research. Clinical haematology,2019 04 16,"Myeloproliferative Neoplasms (MPNs) are a group of progressive diseases that share a common pathogenesis, clinical and laboratory features, as well as a spontaneous risk of secondary AML. Certain MPN therapies have been associated with an increased risk of leukemic conversion, with robust data highlighting the highest rates with 32P, chlorambucil, and pipobroman. Herein, we review risk factors for leukemic transformation, including therapy-related MPN-BP, with a focus on the debate surrounding the potential leukemogenicity of hydroxyurea. Lastly, we discuss emerging studies on the association between ruxolitinib and high grade B-cell lymphomas. We conclude that statistical associations have not implicated hydroxyurea monotherapy as leukemogenic. However, it is difficult to definitely disprove an association, as large prospective, controlled studies with decades of follow-up would be needed to draw conclusions. Overall, the concept of therapy-related neoplasms remains important to the field, and mandates judicious selection and sequencing of therapies for MPN patients.",Therapy-related myeloid neoplasms after treatment for plasma-cell disorders.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927976,Best practice & research. Clinical haematology,2019 04 16,"Therapy-related myeloid neoplasms (t-MN), including therapy-related acute myeloid leukaemia and myelodysplastic syndrome, are second primary malignancies (SPM) that are of growing importance as patients with plasma cell disorders (PCD) such as multiple myeloma (MM) are living longer with more effective therapies. Both patient-specific and treatment-specific factors likely impact the risk of t-MN development after diagnosis and treatment of PCD. Alkylating chemotherapy, especially melphalan, has been strongly tied to the risk of t-MN. More recently, there has been a shift away from long-term alkylating therapies to immunomodulatory agents and high-dose therapy with autologous stem cell transplant (HD-ASCT). This shift has led to improved survival and long-term outcomes for most MM patients. However, the risks of t-MN remain despite the improved efficacy of these treatments, and patients who develop t-MN have a poor prognosis. Understanding the risk factors predisposing MM patients to t-MN can thus help to tailor individualized therapy to maximize anti-myeloma efficacy and minimize the risks of t-MN.",Therapy-related myeloid neoplasms in lymphoma survivors: Reducing risks.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927975,Best practice & research. Clinical haematology,2019 04 16,"Treatment for Hodgkin (HL) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) has changed dramatically in the last fifty years. While there are increasing numbers of long-term survivors, there has been increasing recognition of the long-term toxicities of treatments, particularly therapy-related myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia (t-MDS/AML). The survival for t-MDS/AML is extremely poor. Multiple heterogeneous retrospective studies have reported risk factors for the development of t-MDS/AML. Chemotherapy and radiation therapy have been most closely examined as possible t-MDS/AML risk factors. In this paper, we will review the risks of t-MDS/AML for HL and NHL patients as reported in the literature and assess for any changes over time. In HL patients, the incidence of t-MDS/AML has decreased with a reduction in alkylating agents. In indolent NHL patients, we anticipate decreased incidence of t-MDS/AML as targeted therapies begin to replace cytotoxic chemotherapy.",Myeloid malignancies after treatment for solid tumours.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927974,Best practice & research. Clinical haematology,2019 04 16,"The cure rate for several solid tumour malignancies including breast cancers, head and neck cancers, bone cancers, and sarcoma has improved remarkably with the advent of neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapies. Unfortunately, exposure to chemotherapy or radiation as a part of these treatments exposes patients to the risk of subsequent myeloid malignancies. Therapy related myeloid malignancies have certain characteristic findings. They typically arise within 10 years of treatment exposure, they are seen in younger patients, and the greatest risk is in patients who receive therapy with alkylating agents or topoisomerase II inhibitors. Solid tumours whose therapies utilize these agents at higher doses, namely bone/soft tissue cancers, testicular cancer, anal cancer, and brain tumours, appear to be the groups at highest risk for T-MN. Beyond these patients, emerging populations diagnosed with T-MN include prior platinum exposure, and patients requiring G-CSF support with chemotherapy.",Stem cell damage after chemotherapy- can we do better?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927973,Best practice & research. Clinical haematology,2019 04 16,"Therapy-related myeloid neoplasms are unintended and unwanted complications of cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiation. Unlike other environmental toxin-induced malignancies, exposure to the inciting agent is required to eradicate a primary and life-threatening cancer. In this review, we will focus on the biochemical mechanisms that lead to therapy-induced myeloid malignancy. This includes discussion of known mechanisms by which cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiation induce genetic mutations and promote evolution and expansion of malignant hematopoietic clones. Mechanisms by which the hematopoietic stem and progenitor microenvironment may be injured during the course of chemotherapy and radiation therapy will also be presented. While prevention strategies have not yet been brought into clinical testing or practice, there is active basic research relevant to prevention of t-MNs which is also included in our attempt to answer the question of whether we can do better to prevent stem cell injury after chemotherapy and radiation.",Clinicopathological aspects of therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927972,Best practice & research. Clinical haematology,2019 04 16,"Therapy-related myeloid neoplasm (t-MN) is a rare but devastating consequence of chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy used for the treatment of solid cancers and various hematologic malignancies. Our current understanding of the etiology is that hematopoietic clones that are contemporaneous with the primary cancer and resistant to the cytotoxic exposure have the potential to undergo selective expansion and transformation to t-MN. Consequently, a large proportion of cases are associated with adverse risk factors, resulting in limited effective treatment options. Despite the emergence of some therapies with promising activity in t-MN, most effects are short-lived and allogeneic stem cell transplantation remains the only curative option for eligible patients. This review summarizes the current literature on t-AML and t-MDS, with the aim of providing practical recommendations on the clinical evaluation and management of these conditions.",Germline polymorphisms and the risk of therapy-related myeloid neoplasms.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927971,Best practice & research. Clinical haematology,2019 04 16,"Therapy-related myeloid neoplasms (t-MNs) are one of the lethal complications from cytotoxic chemotherapy/radiation therapy. There is substantial variability in the risk of developing t-MNs among individuals who receive the same level of exposures and it has been widely suspected that germline polymorphisms may influence the risk and account for the variability. As the number of cancer survivors increases, effectively identifying an individual with a high risk of developing t-MNs is crucial. Here, we review the previous studies that investigated the association between germline polymorphisms and the risk of t-MNs. Through this process, we also discuss inconsistencies among the results that stem from the difficulties in conducting an appropriate study to link germline polymorphisms with a disease like t-MN that is rare and has a strong association with external exposures.",Clonal Hematopoiesis and therapy related MDS/AML.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927970,Best practice & research. Clinical haematology,2019 04 16,"Clonal Hematopoiesis is defined as the presence of mutations in peripheral blood in the absence of myeloid malignancies and is thought to occur as a normal part of ageing due to the fitness advantage conferred by these mutations in an ageing hematopoietic compartment. Therapy related myeloid neoplasms are malignancies that occur after exposure to chemotherapy/radiation and are associated with poor survival. Clonal hematopoiesis mutations represent a pre malignant state that can be triggered by exposure to cytotoxic damage and rapid hematopoietic stem cell expansion. We discuss in this review clinical evidence of association of clonal hematopoiesis with risk of therapy related myeloid neoplasms, the underlying mechanisms of clonal expansion under different cellular stresses and recommendations on clinical follow up of patients with clonal hematopoiesis including possible strategies for prevention of therapy related myeloid neoplasms.",Can allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant cure therapy-related acute leukemia?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927969,Best practice & research. Clinical haematology,2019 04 16,"Therapy-related myeloid neoplasms (t-MN) include both therapy-related myelodysplastic syndromes as well as therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia. These two entities were grouped together in the World Health Organization classification of AML due to having similarly poor outcomes and disease biology. Exposure to prior radiation therapy or chemotherapy for other malignant or benign conditions, namely autoimmune diseases or solid organ transplants, constitutes the principal risk factor to develop t-MN. Mechanisms for the development of t-MN include direct genotoxic damage from prior chemotherapy or radiation therapy exposure and the selection of pre-existing clones with malignant potential that are able to evolve with time and manifest as new cancers. Patients with t-MN are generally considered high-risk at the time of diagnosis and are commonly referred for consideration of an allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation, however, this patient population poses unique challenges, and little is known about the ideal sequence and timing of treatment. In this review, we summarize the data pertaining to transplant options, focusing on patient and disease characteristics in which transplantation may be most useful and populations where non-transplant options may also be considered."

The bi-directional interactions between tumor and stromal cells therefore substantially affect tumor cell biology.Herein, we discuss current available information on these interactions in breast cancer chemo-resistance. It is acknowledged that stromal cells extrinsically alter tumor cell drug responses with profound consequences for therapy efficiency, and it is therefore essential to understand the molecular mechanisms which contribute to these substantial alterations because they provide potential targets for improved cancer therapy.

The tumor microenvironment (TME), which includes various types of cells and extracellular components, mediates tumor progression and affects treatment efficacy. TME-mediated drug resistance is associated with tumor cells and their pericellular matrix. Noninherent-adaptive drug resistance refers to a non-cell-autonomous mechanism in which the resistance lies in the treatment process rather than genetic or epigenetic changes, and this mechanism is closely related to the TME. A new concept is therefore proposed in which tumor cell resistance to targeted therapy may be due to non-cell-autonomous mechanisms. However, knowledge of non-cell-autonomous mechanisms of resistance to different treatments is not comprehensive. In this review, we outlined TME factors and molecular events involved in the regulation of non-cell-autonomous resistance of cancer, summarized how the TME contributes to non-cell-autonomous drug resistance in different types of antineoplastic treatment, and discussed the novel strategies to investigate and overcome the non-cell-autonomous mechanism of cancer non-cell-autonomous resistance.",Patient prioritization tools and their effectiveness in non-emergency healthcare services: a systematic review protocol.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927927,Systematic reviews,2019 04 12,"Waiting lists should be managed as fairly as possible to ensure that patients with greater or more urgent needs receive services first.

As a result, the gut has been an attractive model to resolve key mechanisms in epithelial homeostasis. In particular the role of intestinal stem cells (ISCs) in the renewal process has been intensely studied. Interestingly, as opposed to the traditional stem cell theory, the ISC is not a static population but displays significant plasticity and in situations of tissue regeneration more differentiated cells can revert back to a stem cell state upon exposure to extracellular signals. Importantly, normal intestinal homeostasis provides important insight into mechanisms that drive colorectal cancer (CRC) development and growth. Specifically, the dynamics of cancer stem cells bear important resemblance to ISC functionality. In this review we present an overview of the current knowledge on ISCs in homeostasis and their role in malignant transformation. Also, we discuss the existence of stem cells in intestinal adenomas and CRC and how these cells contribute to (pre-)malignant growth. Furthermore, we will focus on new paradigms in the field of dynamical cellular hierarchies in CRC and the intimate relationship between tumor cells and their niche.","Supply, distribution and characteristics of international medical graduates in family medicine in the United States: a cross-sectional study.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927914,BMC family practice,2019 04 12,"To describe the supply, distribution, and characteristics of international medical graduates (IMGs) in family medicine who provide patient care in the U.S.","One-minute stair climbing, 50-foot walk, and timed up-and-go were responsive measures for patients with chronic low back pain undergoing lumbar fusion surgery.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927913,BMC musculoskeletal disorders,2019 04 12,"Physical capacity tasks are useful tools to assess functioning in patients with low back pain (LBP), but evidence is scarce regarding the responsiveness (ability to detect change over time) and minimal important change (MIC).

Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) have emerged as key players among stromal cells, owing to their abundance in most solid tumors and their diverse tumor-restraining/promoting roles. The interplay between tumor cells and neighboring CAFs takes place by both paracrine signals (cytokines, exosomes and metabolites) or by the multifaceted functions of the surrounding extracellular matrix. Here, we dissect the most recent identified mechanisms underlying CAF-mediated control of tumor progression and therapy resistance, which include induction of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), activation of survival pathways or stemness-related programs and metabolic reprogramming in tumor cells. Importantly, the recently unveiled heterogeneity in CAFs claims tailored therapeutic efforts aimed at eradicating the specific subset facilitating tumor progression, therapy resistance and relapse. However, despite the large amount of pre-clinical data, much effort is still needed to translate CAF-directed anti-cancer strategies from the bench to the clinic.","Solid state proton spin-lattice relaxation in polycrystalline methylphenanthrenes.

The solid state gives rise to a situation where methyl group rotation is the only motion on the NMR time scale and the relaxation rates due to the rotations of the 1- and 4-methyl groups are conveniently well-separated in temperature. At these low NMR frequencies, both the slow- and fast-motion limits are observed for the rotation of both methyl groups which allows for a more stringent test of the models. The relaxation is nonexponential as expected when it is caused by methyl group rotation in which case the initial relaxation rate is modeled. Parameters characterizing stretched-exponential fits of the relaxation process are also used both to quantify the degree of nonexponential relaxation and indicate that the observed relaxation is indeed due to the rotation of the two methyl groups. The results are compared with several other polycrystalline methylphenanthrenes and dimethylphenanthrenes. These systems allow for an investigation into how intramolecular and intermolecular interactions between methyl groups and neighboring atoms on the same and neighboring molecules determine the barriers to methyl group rotation.",Gold as a standard phase reference in complex sum frequency generation measurements.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927906,The Journal of chemical physics,2019 04 01,"Complex, soft interfaces abound in the environment, biological systems, and technological applications. Probing these interfaces, particularly those buried between two condensed phases presents many challenges. The only current method capable of probing such interfaces with molecular specificity is the vibrational spectroscopy, sum frequency generation (SFG). SFG is a nonlinear method, which often results both in small signals from minority species being lost in the noise and nonunique separation of resonances. Both issues can be addressed if the complex amplitude rather than the intensity-the square of the amplitude-spectrum is measured. Thus, several methods have been developed to determine the complex spectrum by measuring the sample of interest with respect to a nonresonant material. Incorrect assumptions about the phase of the nonresonant material can result in ambiguity about the sample complex components. This ambiguity can be removed if a phase standard is identified and the phase of the chosen reference material is measured against the standard. This paper reports both verification of a phase standard-Z-cut quartz-and measurement of the phase of gold against this standard. Using this phase standard, the standard phase of Au is determined to be -222° with 532 nm excitation and ppp polarization."

The spectral diffusion seen in the 2D spectra was found to have a large polarization dependence, in large excess of what is predicted by standard theory. This anomaly was explained by decomposing the 2D spectra into hydrogen-bonding and non-bonding components, which exchange through large-angle orientational motion. By adapting chemical exchange theories, parameters for the component peaks were then calculated by fitting the polarization-dependent spectral diffusion and the pump-probe anisotropy. A model of highly heterogeneous exchange and orientational dynamics was used to explain the observed time dependences as a function of temperature on fast time scales. The experimental observations, the kinetic modeling, and physical arguments lead to the determination of the times for interconversion of slow dynamics structural domains to fast dynamics structural domains in the supercooled liquid as a function of temperature. The slow to fast domain interconversion times range from 40 ps at 355 K to 5000 ps at 270 K.",A theoretical study of Ar8+-acetylene collisions at 1.2 MeV: Ionization and dissociation dynamics.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927893,The Journal of chemical physics,2019 04 01,"We theoretically study Ar8+-induced dissociation of C2H2 molecule at 1.2 MeV using the time-dependent density-functional theory non-adiabatically coupled to nuclear dynamics.

Here, we describe how the semiclassical Maxwell-Liouville method can be used to calculate the optical response from inhomogeneously broadened states. After describing the Maxwell-Liouville algorithm, we use the method to study the photon echoes from quantum dots and compare the results against analytical models.

We then invoke the proposed formalism to shed some light on the inaccuracies behind current calculations of osmotic second virial coefficients from molecular theory and simulation as well as macroscopic correlations. To advance the microscopic understanding and illustrate the functional relationship between the osmotic second virial coefficients, Henry's law constant, and the solute-solvent intermolecular asymmetry as a source of solution non-ideality, we use data for the microstructural and thermodynamic behavior of infinitely dilute Lennard-Jones systems obtained self-consistently via integral equations calculations. The newly derived relationships leading to the proposed formalism offer novel routes for the accurate determination of osmotic second virial coefficients of any type of solutes in dilute solutions regardless of the type and nature of the intermolecular interactions.

The underlying free energy landscape supports competing structures separated by relatively high barriers, with the two principal funnels leading to the major and minor conformations identified by NMR experiments. The interconversion time scale is predicted to be a few hundred seconds, consistent with the experimental lower bound estimates.

One corresponds to the direction between the equilibrium geometry in the electronic ground state, referred to as the Franck-Condon geometry, and the minimum of conical intersection (CI), while the other two span the two-dimensional branching space at the CI. The model correctly reproduces the topography of the PESs. The ab initio calculations are performed with the extended multiconfiguration quasidegenerate perturbation theory at second order method.

Enhanced or directed enzyme diffusion can alter the accessibility of substrates and the organization of enzymes within cells. Several studies based on fluorescence correlation spectroscopy report enhanced diffusion of enzymes upon interaction with their substrate or inhibitor. In this context, major importance is given to the enzyme fructose-bisphosphate aldolase, for which enhanced diffusion has been reported even though the catalysed reaction is endothermic. Additionally, enhanced diffusion of tracer particles surrounding the active aldolase enzymes has been reported. These studies suggest that active enzymes can act as chemical motors that self-propel and give rise to enhanced diffusion. However, fluorescence studies of enzymes can, despite several advantages, suffer from artefacts. Here, we show that the absolute diffusion coefficients of active enzyme solutions can be determined with Pulsed Field Gradient Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (PFG-NMR). The advantage of PFG-NMR is that the motion of the molecule of interest is directly observed in its native state without the need for any labelling. Furthermore, PFG-NMR is model-free and thus yields absolute diffusion constants. Our PFG-NMR experiments of solutions containing active fructose-bisphosphate aldolase from rabbit muscle do not show any diffusion enhancement for the active enzymes, nor the surrounding molecules.

The spectra of the n = 1 complex are consistent with the ab initio structure, which involves a nearly linear arrangement of CCC-HO atoms in the complex. The C3-H2O spectrum we obtain exhibits slight differences from the analogous C3-D2O spectrum, which we assign to a difference in linewidth between the two spectra.

Our method is applicable to any solids and fluids. For glasses, we assume quasi-equilibrium around a fixed inherent state. Then, we obtain linear-response expressions for any variables including the stress and the particle displacements, even though the glass interior is elastically inhomogeneous. In particular, the shear modulus can be expressed in terms of the correlations between the interior stress and the forces from the walls. It can also be expressed in terms of the inter-particle correlations, as has been shown in the previous literature. Our stress relaxation function includes the effect of the boundary walls and can be used for inhomogeneous flow response. We show the presence of long-ranged, long-lived correlations among the fluctuations of the forces from the walls and the displacements of all the particles in the cell. We confirm these theoretical results numerically in a two-dimensional model glass. As an application, we describe emission and propagation of transverse sounds after boundary wall motions using these time-correlation functions. We also find resonant sound amplification when the frequency of an oscillatory shear approaches that of the first transverse sound mode."

Typically, existing path searching methods perform local sampling around the path nodes in a pre-selected collective variable (CV) space to allow a gradual downhill evolution of the path toward the MFEP. Despite the wide application of such a strategy, the gradual path evolution and the non-trivial a priori choice of CVs are also limiting its overall efficiency and automation. Here we demonstrate that non-local perpendicular sampling can be pursued to accelerate the search, provided that all nodes are reordered thereafter via a traveling-salesman scheme. Moreover, path-CVs can be computed on-the-fly and used as a coordinate system, minimizing the necessary prior knowledge about the system. Our traveling-salesman based automated path searching method achieves a 5-8 times speedup over the string method with swarms-of-trajectories for two peptide systems in vacuum and solution, making it a promising method for obtaining initial pathways when investigating functional conformational changes between a pair of structures.",Tungsten deposits facilitate oxidation of the NiAl(110) surface.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927872,The Journal of chemical physics,2019 04 01,"The alumina film formed by oxidation of NiAl(110) has gained enormous attention as a surface-science compatible model system for a crystalline and atomically flat oxide surface. A main disadvantage is its small thickness of only 0.5 nm that limits possible uses in catalytic studies at elevated temperature and pressure. This work demonstrates how small amounts of tungsten pre-deposited onto the NiAl surface modify the oxidation characteristic. Oxidizing the surface at 850 K in the presence of W particles increases the film thickness to 2.5 nm, a value that rises to more than 5 nm at 1050 K oxidation temperature. Thickness, stoichiometry, and morphology of the thickened alumina films are analyzed in detail by means of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, electron-diffraction, and scanning tunneling microscopy. The promoted oxide formation is ascribed to the unique redox properties of tungsten that stabilizes O2 molecules from the gas phase and produces active oxygen species for further reaction.",Coherent two-dimensional electronic and infrared crystallography.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927871,The Journal of chemical physics,2019 04 01,"The two-dimensional electronic and infrared spectroscopy of oriented single crystals is sensitive to structure and point group symmetry. The third order response of crystals is generally different from measurements of isotropic solutions because each coherence path that contributes to the measured field scales to the ensemble average of the four-point correlation functions of the four field-dipole interactions involved in the respective Feynman paths. An analytical evaluation of 2D optical crystallography which depends on the crystal symmetry, laboratory orientation, and the orientation in the crystallographic frame is presented. Applying a symmetry operator in the basis of the allowed polarised radiation modes provides a method for evaluation of non-zero fourth rank tensor elements alternative to direct inspection methods. Uniaxial and biaxial systems are distinguished and the contributions to the rephasing and non-rephasing directions are evaluated for isolated and coupled oscillators. By exploiting coordinate analysis, the extension of non-linear electronic and infrared crystallography for coupled oscillators demonstrates the structural, directional, and symmetry dependent selection of coherences to the four-wave mixing signal.",Effective yet reliable computation of hyperfine coupling constants in solution by a QM/MM approach: Interplay between electrostatics and non-electrostatic effects.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927869,The Journal of chemical physics,2019 04 01,"In this paper, we have extended to the calculation of hyperfine coupling constants, the model recently proposed by some of the present authors [Giovannini et al., J. Chem. Theory Comput. 13, 4854-4870 (2017)] to include Pauli repulsion and dispersion effects in Quantum Mechanical/Molecular Mechanics (QM/MM) approaches. The peculiarity of the proposed approach stands in the fact that repulsion/dispersion contributions are explicitly introduced in the QM Hamiltonian. Therefore, such terms not only enter the evaluation of energetic properties but also propagate to molecular properties and spectra. A novel parametrization of the electrostatic fluctuating charge force field has been developed, thus allowing a quantitative reproduction of reference QM interaction energies. Such a parametrization has been then tested against the prediction of EPR parameters of prototypical nitroxide radicals in aqueous solutions.",Multireference Rayleigh-Schrödinger perturbation theory and its application.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927868,The Journal of chemical physics,2019 04 01,"Based on the complete active space multireference wavefunction, multireference Rayleigh-Schrödinger perturbation theory (MRSPT) is derived with the assumption that the orbital energies of active orbitals are the same as ε¯, an unknown parameter. In this work, ε¯ is optimized at the MRSPT2 level. The second and third order perturbation theories are shown numerically to be size extensive. The second order perturbation theory is exploited to compute the ground state energies of F2, AlH, HCl, and P2 and to optimize the equilibrium bond lengths and harmonic vibrational frequencies of BH, BF, P2, HF, and F2. The dissociation behaviors of NH3 and OH- have also been investigated.

The present work provides high-level quantum chemical predictions of their spectroscopic parameters to observe this system in the interstellar medium. The spectroscopic parameters, stability, and geometries of the lowest stable isomers of its isoelectronic system [Al, N, S] were characterized using coupled-cluster CCSD(T), explicitly correlated coupled-cluster CCSD(T)-F12, and multireference configuration interaction. The three-dimensional potential energy surfaces of all isomers were computed at the CCSD(T)-F12/aug-cc-pV5Z level, and a set of spectroscopic parameters were calculated. In both systems, the most stable isomer is linear with an X3Σ- electronic ground state, and all linear isomers are characterized by small bending modes of less than 200 cm-1. Due to their large dipole moments, the high intensities of such modes, and the nonexistence of anharmonic resonance complicating their spectra, our results facilitate the detection of AlNO and AlNS in the laboratory or in the interstellar medium.",Structure of water confined between two parallel graphene plates.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927866,The Journal of chemical physics,2019 04 01,"We study, in this paper, the physical properties of water confined between two parallel graphene plates with different slit widths to understand the effects of confinement on the water structure and how bulk properties are reached as the water layer thickens. It was found that the microscopic structures of the interfacial liquid layer close to graphene vary with the slit width. Water tends to locate at the center of the six-membered ring of graphene planes to form triangular patterns, as found by others. The narrower the slit width is, the more pronounced this pattern is, except for the slit width of 9.5 Å, for which a well-defined two-layer structure of water forms. On the other hand, squared structures can be clearly seen in single snapshots at small (6.5 Å and 7.5 Å) but not large slit widths. Even at small slit widths, the square-like geometry is observed only when an average is taken for a short trajectory, and averaging over a long time yields a triangular pattern dictated by the graphene geometry. We estimate the length of time needed to observe two patterns, respectively. We also used the two-phase thermodynamic model to study the variation of entropy of confined water and found that at 8.5 Å, the entropy of confined water is larger than that of bulk water. The rotational entropy of confined water is higher than that of bulk water for all slit widths due to the reduction of the hydrogen bond in the confined space.",On reversals in 2D turbulent Rayleigh-Bénard convection: Insights from embedding theory and comparison with proper orthogonal decomposition analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927865,"Chaos (Woodbury, N.Y.)",2019 04 05,"Turbulent Rayleigh-Bénard convection in a 2D square cell is characterized by the existence of a large-scale circulation which varies intermittently. We focus on a range of Rayleigh numbers where the large-scale circulation experiences rapid non-trivial reversals from one quasi-steady (or meta-stable) state to another. In previous work [B. Podvin and A. Sergent, J. Fluid Mech. 766, 172201 (2015); B. Podvin and A. Sergent, Phys. Rev. E 95, 013112 (2017)], we applied proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) to the joint temperature and velocity fields at a given Rayleigh number, and the dynamics of the flow were characterized in a multi-dimensional POD space. Here, we show that several of those findings, which required extensive data processing over a wide range of both spatial and temporal scales, can be reproduced, and possibly extended, by application of the embedding theory to a single time series of the global angular momentum, which is equivalent here to the most energetic POD mode. Specifically, the embedding theory confirms that the switches among meta-stable states are uncorrelated. It also shows that, despite the large number of degrees of freedom of the turbulent Rayleigh Bénard flow, a low dimensional description of its physics can be derived with low computational efforts, providing that a single global observable reflecting the symmetry of the system is identified. A strong connection between the local stability properties of the reconstructed attractor and the characteristics of the reversals can also be established.",A normal form method for the determination of oscillations characteristics near the primary Hopf bifurcation in bandpass optoelectronic oscillators: Theory and experiment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927864,"Chaos (Woodbury, N.Y.)",2019 04 05,"We propose a framework for the analysis of the integro-differential delay Ikeda equations ruling the dynamics of bandpass optoelectronic oscillators (OEOs).

Linear analysis using the perturbation method illustrates the short-wave physics leading to the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI). The interface dynamics are chaotic, and analysis beyond the onset of instability is required to understand the nonlinear evolution of waves. The two-equation FFM solver based on a higher-order spatiotemporal finite difference scheme is used in the current simulations. The solution methodology is verified, and the results are compared with the measurements from a laboratory-scale experiment. The finite-time Lyapunov exponent (FTLE) based on simulations is comparable and slightly higher than the autocorrelation function decay rate, consistent with previous findings. Furthermore, the FTLE is observed to be a strong function of the angle of inclination, while the root mean square of the interface height exhibits a square-root dependence. It is demonstrated that this simple 1-D FFM captures the essential chaotic features of the interface dynamics. This study also adds to a growing body of work indicating that a TFM with appropriate short wavelength physics is well-behaved and chaotic beyond the KHI.",Rare event simulation for steady-state probabilities via recurrency cycles.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927852,"Chaos (Woodbury, N.Y.)",2019 04 05,"We develop a new algorithm for the estimation of rare event probabilities associated with the steady-state of a Markov stochastic process with continuous state space Rd and discrete time steps (i.e., a discrete-time Rd-valued Markov chain).

It was previously shown that, for even (but not odd) D, similar to the original Kuramoto model (D=2), there exists a continuous dynamical phase transition from incoherence to coherence of the time asymptotic attracting state (time t→∞) as the coupling parameter K increases through a critical value which we denote Kc(+)>0. We consider this transition from the point of view of the stability of an incoherent state, where an incoherent state is defined as one for which the N→∞ distribution function is time-independent and the macroscopic order parameter is zero. In contrast with D=2, for even D>2, there is an infinity of possible incoherent equilibria, each of which becomes unstable with increasing K at a different point K=Kc. Although there are incoherent equilibria for which Kc=Kc(+), there are also incoherent equilibria with a range of possible Kc values below Kc(+), (Kc(+)/2)≤Kc<Kc(+). How can the possible instability of incoherent states arising at K=Kc<Kc(+) be reconciled with the previous finding that, at large time (t→∞), the state is always incoherent unless K>Kc(+)? We find, for a given incoherent equilibrium, that, if K is rapidly increased from K<Kc to Kc<K<Kc(+), due to the instability, a short, macroscopic burst of coherence is observed, in which the coherence initially grows exponentially, but then reaches a maximum, past which it decays back into incoherence. Furthermore, after this decay, we observe that the equilibrium has been reset to a new equilibrium whose Kc value exceeds that of the increased K. Thus, this process, which we call ""Instability-Mediated Resetting,"" leads to an increase in the effective Kc with continuously increasing K, until the equilibrium has been effectively set to one for which Kc≈Kc(+). Thus, instability-mediated resetting leads to a unique critical point of the t→∞ time asymptotic state (K=Kc(+)) in spite of the existence of an infinity of possible pretransition incoherent states.",Identifying influential spreaders in complex networks by propagation probability dynamics.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927850,"Chaos (Woodbury, N.Y.)",2019 04 05,"Numerous well-known processes of complex systems such as spreading and cascading are mainly affected by a small number of critical nodes. Identifying influential nodes that lead to broad spreading in complex networks is of great theoretical and practical importance. Since the identification of vital nodes is closely related to propagation dynamics, a novel method DynamicRank that employs the probability model to measure the ranking scores of nodes is suggested. The influence of a node can be denoted by the sum of probability scores of its i order neighboring nodes. This simple yet effective method provides a new idea to understand the identification of vital nodes in propagation dynamics. Experimental studies on both Susceptible-Infected-Recovered and Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible models in real networks demonstrate that it outperforms existing methods such as Coreness, H-index, LocalRank, Betweenness, and Spreading Probability in terms of the Kendall τ coefficient. The linear time complexity enables it to be applied to real large-scale networks with tens of thousands of nodes and edges in a short time.",Scattering statistics in nonlinear wave chaotic systems.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927849,"Chaos (Woodbury, N.Y.)",2019 04 05,"The Random Coupling Model (RCM) is a statistical approach for studying the scattering properties of linear wave chaotic systems in the semi-classical regime. Its success has been experimentally verified in various over-moded wave settings, including both microwave and acoustic systems. It is of great interest to extend its use in nonlinear systems. This paper studies the impact of a nonlinear port on the measured statistical electromagnetic properties of a ray-chaotic complex enclosure in the short wavelength limit. A Vector Network Analyzer is upgraded with a high power option, which enables calibrated scattering (S) parameter measurements up to +43dBm. By attaching a diode to the excitation antenna, amplitude-dependent S-parameters and Wigner reaction matrix (impedance) statistics are observed. We have systematically studied how the key components in the RCM are affected by this nonlinear port, including the radiation impedance, short ray orbit corrections, and statistical properties. By applying the newly developed radiation efficiency extension to the RCM, we find that the diode admittance increases with the excitation amplitude. This reduces the amount of power entering the cavity through the port so that the diode effectively acts as a protection element. As a result, we have developed a quantitative understanding of the statistical scattering properties of a semi-classical wave chaotic system with a nonlinear coupling channel.",Critical behavior of power transmission network complex dynamics in the OPA model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927848,"Chaos (Woodbury, N.Y.)",2019 04 05,"Many complex infrastructure systems, such as electric power transmission grids, display characteristics of a critical or near critical behavior with a risk of large cascading failures.

Here, experiments were performed with the enzyme urease loaded into mm-sized agarose beads and placed in a solution of urea, resulting in an increase in pH. This behavior was found to be dependent upon the number of beads present in the array; however, reaction-induced convection occurred and plumes of high pH developed that extended to the walls of the reactor. The convection resulted in the motion of the mm-sized particles and conversion of the solution to high pH. Simulations in a simple model of the beads demonstrated the suppression of dynamical quorum sensing in the presence of flow.",Prediction of robust chaos in micro and nanoresonators under two-frequency excitation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927846,"Chaos (Woodbury, N.Y.)",2019 04 05,"Robust chaos in a dynamical system is characterized by the persistence of the chaotic attractor with changes in the system parameters and is generally required in practical applications based upon physical sources of chaos. However, for applications that rely upon continuous time chaotic signals, there are now very few alternatives of dynamical systems with robust chaos that could be used. In this context, it is important to find a new dynamical system and, particularly, new physical systems that present robust chaos. In this work, we show through simulations that a relevant physical system, suspended beam micro and nanoelectromechanical resonators, can present robust chaos when excited by two distinct frequencies. To demonstrate the existence of robust chaos in the system, we perform an extensive numerical analysis, showing that the attractor is unique and changes smoothly in a large region of the relevant physical parameter space. We find that the robustness of the chaotic dynamics depends crucially on the dissipation, which must be sufficiently small. When the dissipation is small, we find a large range of frequencies, frequency ratios, and applied voltages where robust chaos is observed. These findings turn these systems into viable and strong candidates for practical applications since the chaotic dynamics becomes quite insensitive to fabrication tolerances, changes in the physical parameters induced by the environment, and aging.",Variety of rotation modes in a small chain of coupled pendulums.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927845,"Chaos (Woodbury, N.Y.)",2019 04 05,"This article studies the rotational dynamics of three identical coupled pendulums. There exist two parameter areas where the in-phase rotational motion is unstable and out-of-phase rotations are realized. Asymptotic theory is developed that allows us to analytically identify borders of instability areas of in-phase rotation motion. It is shown that out-of-phase rotations are the result of the parametric instability of in-phase motion. Complex out-of-phase rotations are numerically found and their stability and bifurcations are defined. It is demonstrated that the emergence of chaotic dynamics happens due to the period doubling bifurcation cascade. The detailed scenario of symmetry breaking is presented. The development of chaotic dynamics leads to the origin of two chaotic attractors of different types. The first one is characterized by the different phases of all pendulums. In the second case, the phases of the two pendulums are equal, and the phase of the third one is different. This regime can be interpreted as a drum-head mode in star-networks. It may also indicate the occurrence of chimera states in chains with a greater number of nearest-neighbour interacting elements and in analogical systems with global coupling.",Feedback pinning control of collective behaviors aroused by epidemic spread on complex networks.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927844,"Chaos (Woodbury, N.Y.)",2019 04 05,"This paper investigates feedback pinning control of synchronization behaviors aroused by epidemic spread on complex networks. Based on the quenched mean field theory, epidemic control synchronization models with the inhibition of contact behavior are constructed, combined with the epidemic transmission system and the adaptive dynamical network carrying active controllers. By the properties of convex functions and the Gerschgorin theorem, the epidemic threshold of the model is obtained, and the global stability of disease-free equilibrium is analyzed. For individual's infected situation, when an epidemic disease spreads, two types of feedback control strategies depending on the diseases' information are designed: the first one only adds controllers to infected individuals, and the other adds controllers to both infected and susceptible ones. By using the Lyapunov stability theory, under designed controllers, some criteria that guarantee the epidemic controlled synchronization system achieving behavior synchronization are also derived. Several numerical simulations are performed to show the effectiveness of our theoretical results. As far as we know, this is the first work to address the controlled behavioral synchronization induced by epidemic spread under the pinning feedback mechanism. It is hopeful that we may have deeper insights into the essence between the disease's spread and collective behavior under active control in complex dynamical networks."

In this paper, we newly introduce a mathematical formulation of physical RNGs based on a model of chaotic dynamics and give the first rigorous results. In particular, by combining ergodic theory, information theory, and response theory of statistical physics, our theory guarantees, for the model of chaotic dynamics, the coexistence of two crucial properties necessary for physical RNGs: fast random number generation and robustness.

The nonlocal strain gradient theory and the Kelvin-Voigt model are used to consider the significance of nonlocal field, strain gradient field, and viscoelastic damping effects. The dimensionless equation of transverse motion and related classical and non-classical boundary conditions are derived using the variational approach. The partial differential equations are discretized to a system of ordinary differential equations by the use of Galerkin's method. The frequency equation is obtained as a function of dimensionless flow velocity, small-scale parameters, damping coefficient, and power-law parameter. Numerical results are presented to study the dynamical behavior of the system and are compared with experimental and theoretical results reported by other researchers. Coupled and single mode fluttering related to higher vibration modes of fluid-conveying nanotubes supported at both ends are studied for the first time. It is found that coupled mode fluttering can be seen for different vibration modes by increasing the flow velocity in the absence of structural damping. Structural damping changes the dynamical behavior of the system, in which by increasing the flow velocity, single mode fluttering occurs instead of coupled mode fluttering. In addition, the presence of structural damping increases the critical flow velocity and, as a result, increases the stability of the system. The results also show that increasing the nonlocal parameter will have a stiffness-softening effect, while increasing the strain gradient length scale has an opposing effect.",Embodied neuromechanical chaos through homeostatic regulation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927830,"Chaos (Woodbury, N.Y.)",2019 04 05,"In this paper, we present detailed analyses of the dynamics of a number of embodied neuromechanical systems of a class that has been shown to efficiently exploit chaos in the development and learning of motor behaviors for bodies of arbitrary morphology.

At the heart of these systems are neural central pattern generating (CPG) units connected to actuators which return proprioceptive information via an adaptive homeostatic mechanism. Detailed dynamical analyses of example systems, using high resolution largest Lyapunov exponent maps, demonstrate the existence of chaotic regimes within a particular region of parameter space, as well as the striking similarity of the maps for systems of varying size. Thanks to the homeostatic sensory mechanisms, any single CPG ""views"" the whole of the rest of the system as if it was another CPG in a two coupled system, allowing a scale invariant conceptualization of such embodied neuromechanical systems. The analysis reveals chaos at all levels of the systems; the entire brain-body-environment system exhibits chaotic dynamics which can be exploited to power an exploration of possible motor behaviors. The crucial influence of the adaptive homeostatic mechanisms on the system dynamics is examined in detail, revealing chaotic behavior characterized by mixed mode oscillations (MMOs).

Most in vivo health studies conducted regarding air pollutants, including particulate matter (PM) and gas phase pollutants, have been either through traditional medical intranasal treatment or using a tiny chamber, which limit animal activities. In this study, we designed and tested a large, whole-body, multiple animal exposure chamber with uniform dispersion and exposure stability for animal studies. The chamber simultaneously controls particle size distribution and PM mass concentration. Two different methods were used to generate aerosol suspension through either soluble material (Alternaria extract), liquid particle suspension (nanosilica solution), or dry powder (silica powder).

Despite overlapping spatially and temporally in experiments, the soft x-ray signal from the nanosecond laser ablating the inner wall of an Au hohlraum and the hard x-ray signal from the bremsstrahlung radiation of hot electrons generated by a picosecond laser were separated by different image processes by filtering and collimating the two signals differently. The time sequence between the two x-ray signals was analyzed to extract the injection time of the picosecond laser relative to the hohlraum emission. By tracking the neutron yield as a function of the injection time of the picosecond laser, a clear positive correlation between the neutron yield enhancement and the derived injection times was exhibited. The heating effect of the picosecond laser was confirmed. It is concluded that this method could be used to measure the injecting time and validate the picosecond laser injection."

Even though numerous techniques have been proven to be effective in improving the signal-to-noise ratio by filtering out frequency bands, how to efficiently reduce noise is still a crucial issue due to several restrictions, e.g., prior information requirement, stationary data assumption. To end this, a new multivariate algorithm based on the fusion of principal component analysis (PCA) and singular value decomposition (SVD), namely, principal component analysis and decomposition (PCAD), was presented. This novel algorithm aims to reduce noise as well as cancel the interference of FID transversal data. Specifically, the PCAD algorithm is able to obtain the dominant principal components of the FID and that of the noise floor by PCA, in which an optimal number of subspaces could be retained via a cumulative percent of variance criterion. Furthermore, the PCA was combined with an SVD filter whose singular values corresponding to the interferences were identified, and then the noise was suppressed by nulling the corresponding singular values, which was able to achieve an optimum trade-off between the preservation of pure FID data and the denoising efficiency. Our proposed PCAD algorithm was compared with the widely used filter methods via extensive experiments on synthetic and real FID transversal data under different noise levels. The results demonstrated that this method can preserve the FID transversal data better and shows a significant improvement in noise suppression.",Improved sphericity error evaluation combining a heuristic search algorithm with the feature points model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927808,The Review of scientific instruments,2019 04 08,"This paper describes a high-speed method of evaluating sphericity errors using a heuristic search algorithm combined with a feature points model (HSA-FPM). First, the sphere center and sphericity of the least-squares sphere are calculated to establish the initial candidate points of the sphere center. An iterative search procedure is then conducted based on the specified heuristic search algorithm and sphericity evaluation criterion, and the current globally optimal sphere center O is obtained under certain termination conditions. To determine the decisive feature points and construct a sphericity evaluation model, the distances di between the sphere center O and all sampling points are calculated and sorted. The modified sphere centers are then determined using the corresponding feature points model. As an application example, the Nelder-Mead algorithm is combined with the feature points model. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves the exact sphericity solution with relatively few iterations, requiring only ∼0.01 s for the whole evaluation procedure. This corresponds to an improvement in evaluation efficiency of ∼26%-61% over previous methods. The proposed HSA-FPM method is in complete agreement with several well-known evaluation criteria and is quite suitable for real-time measurements and evaluations of sphericity errors.",Development and assessment of a multi-beam continuous-phantom-motion x-ray scatter projection imaging system.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927807,The Review of scientific instruments,2019 04 08,"X-ray image formation using scattered radiation can yield a superior contrast-to-noise ratio compared to conventional transmission x-ray imaging. A barrier to practical implementation of scatter imaging systems has been slow image acquisition. We have developed a projection imaging system which uses five monoenergetic pencil beams in combination with continuous phantom motion to achieve acquisition times that are practical for medical and security applications. The system was configured at the Canadian Light Source synchrotron and consists of a primary collimator, motorized stages for phantom translation, a flat-panel x-ray detector for measuring scattered x rays, and photodiodes for simultaneously measuring transmitted x rays. Image generation requires several corrections to raw data artifacts arising from the nature of the detector, x-ray source, and acquisition procedure. We developed a novel correction for pixel location inaccuracy arising from continuous phantom motion. A five-beam system had nearly five times faster acquisition than a single-beam system. Continuous motion acquisition was approximately 30 times faster than step-and-shoot acquisition. The total acquisition time for a 9 cm × 5 cm phantom with 8425 pixels was just over 2 min. Image quality was also assessed, in part to determine its relation to acquisition speed. The width of sharp material boundaries was found to be at a minimum equal to the pencil beam width (1.75 mm) and to have an additional width equal to the product of the phantom translation speed and the acquisition time per pixel (up to 1.0 mm in our experiments). Contrast-detail performance was independent of acquisition speed, depending only on phantom entrance x-ray fluence. Pixel signal-to-noise ratio measurements indicate that detector readout noise is important for the scatter data, even for phantom air kerma as high as 30 mGy. Images could be improved with a detector having lower readout noise and higher sensitivity. Its spatial resolution could be moderate. We confirmed that for the same range of λ-1 sin(θ/2), where λ is the x-ray wavelength and θ is the scattering angle, scatter images acquired using different beam energies (33-70 keV) had nearly identical contrast.",Capacitive sensor for fast pulsed voltage monitor in transmission line.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927806,The Review of scientific instruments,2019 04 08,"To monitor fast pulsed voltage in the transmission line of the fast linear transformer driver, a compact and self-integrating capacitive sensor is developed. A printed circuit board (PCB) with multi-layer ceramic capacitors (MLCCs) serves as a low-voltage arm. Given the reflow structure of the PCB and a parallel arrangement of MLCCs, the residual inductance of the PCB low-voltage arm can be effectively reduced. Moreover, its capacitance can be easily adjusted. The capacitive sensor is designed using a coaxial structure, suitable for installation on the inner high voltage electrode of the secondary water-insulated transmission line. Three matching schemes for the measuring cable are discussed, showing that two-stage division with matching at the end of the cable is more suitable for fast pulsed voltage measurement due to its high dividing ratio and flat frequency response. A square wave with a rise time of ∼1.5 ns and a pulse width of ∼200 ns is used to verify the properties of the capacitive sensor. The results show that the rise time of the designed capacitive sensor can reach 1.5 ns when a short cable is used. Increasing capacitance of the low-voltage arm or resistance at the cable entrance will increase the time constant of the capacitive sensor, which improves its low-frequency properties. A long cable will significantly reduce the high-frequency response and the magnitude of the signal from the capacitive sensor.","Low-frequency, broadband piezoelectric vibration energy harvester with folded trapezoidal beam.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927805,The Review of scientific instruments,2019 04 08,"To efficiently scavenge the energy from low-frequency ambient vibrations, this paper proposed a piezoelectric energy harvester (PEH) with a six-segment folded trapezoidal beam.

A new form of light trap with multiple hollow cones is introduced to suppress backward-scattered stray light. To evaluate the effect of the light trap on suppressing stray light for our nephelometer, a simulation model with and without the light trap was analyzed. Our results show that without the light trap, the percentage of backward-scattered stray light can be more than 50% for some kinds of particles.

Using the device, it was possible to continuously evaluate the concentration and pH of reagents in the 24 wells in real time. Moreover, cell activity and protein production were detectable using the device. These results suggest that the newly fabricated device is a promising tool for the evaluation of cell behaviors for cell management.",Direct-current current transformer for the measurement of an electric propulsion ion beam.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927767,The Review of scientific instruments,2019 04 08,"An important task in the development of electric propulsion devices is ground-based testing. In order to characterize electric thrusters, their generated ion beams are regarded as figures of merit and have to be well-known and understood. We present an approach to measure DC ion beam currents generated by electric thrusters by means of an inductive direct-current current transformer. In contrast to commonly used devices like Faraday cups, this device can measure the beam current non-intrusively by means of magnetic field coupling rather than charge collection. This paper shows the development of a prototype sensor which can measure currents in the typical range for electric thrusters with high resolution and satisfactory accuracy. A detailed SPICE model to assist during hardware development is also introduced and verified by test case measurements. The prototype has been tested and validated with a radio-frequency ion thruster. Its readout shows very good agreement with the output of an analytical model which computes a Gaussian-shaped ion beam in the far-field based on experimental input data.",High-brightness beam tests of the very high frequency gun at the Advanced Photo-injector EXperiment test facility at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927765,The Review of scientific instruments,2019 04 08,"The very-high-frequency gun (VHF-Gun) is a new concept photo-injector developed and built at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) for generating high-brightness electron beams capable of driving X-ray free electron lasers (FELs) at MHz-class repetition rates.

Its fruits are characterized by oval or oval-oblong shape, with colours ranging from light yellow to dark cherry. The taste of fruits is usually considered to be tart- sweet, sour and in some cases sweet-pineapple. All cultivars of the cornelian cherry have a high biological value, which is mainly connected with their antioxidant activity, as well as with their phenolic compound and ascorbic acid content. The main pro-health properties of the cornelian cherry are related to the large amount of anthocyanins. The basic raw material is fruits; however, leaves, flowers and seeds are also used as a source of active ingredients. The chemical composition of cornelian cherry fruits is diversified and depends to a large extent on the cultivar, as well as on cultivation, and the environmental and climatic conditions.",Assessing Anaerobic Soil Disinfestation as a Control Tactic for Delia radicum (Diptera: Anthomyiidae) in California Brussels Sprouts.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927746,Environmental entomology,2019 06 07,"Fumigants are often the primary material used to manage plant disease agents, soil-borne arthropods, and weeds in California agriculture, particularly in the absence of crop rotation. However, some fumigants have come under increased regulatory scrutiny and are therefore no longer available for use. We tested two biologically based preplant crop-protection fumigant alternatives for their effectiveness in reducing populations of Delia radicum (L.), a soil-borne insect pest of cole crops. Laboratory and field tests compared pest survival in untreated control soil with survival under anaerobic soil disinfestation (ASD), which is induced by incorporating a carbon source (rice bran or grape pomace) and subsequently saturating the soil with water. We also measured and compared the effects of standard grower practices (fumigation), ASD and biofumigation (mustard seed meal incorporated before planting), and untreated control soils on fly abundance, pupal survival, and root damage in Brussels sprout fields. In both laboratory and field studies, D. radicum pupal survivorship was reduced in ASD-treated soils relative to control soils. Pupal survivorship of Musca domestica (L.) (Diptera: Muscidae), which was used as a proxy for D. radicum in some field experiments, was also reduced in ASD- and biofumigation-treated soils, when compared with untreated control soils.

Our major hypothesis was that dietary exposure to the soy phytoestrogen DAZ could modulate the immune responses toward a protective effect and lead to improved metabolic functions (such as glucose metabolism). In this study, we applied complementary mouse models, the hybrid B6C3F1 and inbred type 1 diabetes prone non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice, to investigate if DAZ exposure modulated the immune responses. The animals were orally administered DAZ at various physiological doses (2-20 mg/kg body weight) during adulthood. DAZ significantly altered the relative organ weights in female B6C3F1 mice and decreased the B cell population (represented by CD3-IgM+), while the T cell populations (represented by CD3+IgM-, CD4+CD8- and CD4-CD8+) were increased. In addition, DAZ dosing produced a decrease in the percentage of late apoptotic thymocytes. However, the activities cytotoxic T cells and natural killer cells were not altered in the B6C3F1 mice. In NOD mice, the blood glucose level and glucose tolerance were not affected by DAZ exposure, but DAZ modulated the antibody production, as shown by increased levels of IgG2b in NOD females and IgG1 in NOD males. Further, DAZ increased CD8+CD25+ splenocytes in NOD females. Taken together, DAZ induced an immunomodulatory effect in both NOD and B6C3F1 mouse strains; however, minimal effects on glucose homeostasis were observed."

The studies of the life span and influencing factors of metal mesh in the artificial soil in humid areas will guide ecological restoration of rock-cut slopes in Southwest China. Due to metal corrosion, the fixation function of the metal mesh could last for 10 years. The factors of soil contents, soil electrochemical properties and soil bacteria not only changed with the vegetation succession but also weakened the effect of the metal mesh on soil fixation for slope protection. The potential gradient, chloride ion content, sulfate ion content and water content were the main influencing factors for metal mesh corrosion during the vegetation restoration stage from 0 to 5 years, while the corrosion potential, potential gradient, chloride ion content, and water content were the main influential factors for metal mesh corrosion during the vegetation restoration stage after 11 years. At different vegetation restoration stages, the soil bacteria contained different dominant species, which had spatial heterogeneity, and the heterogeneity of the soil bacteria was another factor influencing the corrosion of the buried metal mesh. Meanwhile, the plant root as a soil fixation function strengthened with time, and 8 years later, the local woody plants gradually migrated to form a community dominated by multiple woody species. It is the first time that the life span of a metal mesh under the artificial soil of rock-cut slopes and factors affecting the different corrosion stages of the metal mesh in a humid area have been judged. The fixation function of plant root gradually replaces metal mesh, and main factors affecting the process include soil contents, soil electrochemical properties and soil bacteria. The research on corrosion factors of metal mesh under artificial soil for rock-cut slopes will contribute towards reducing the environmental risk of ecological restoration.","Combined use of diffusive gradients in thin film, high-resolution dialysis technique and traditional methods to assess pollution and bioavailability of sediment metals of lake wetlands in Taihu Lake Basin.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927725,The Science of the total environment,2019 05 02,"The geochemical behavior of trace metals at the sediment/water interface in Taihu Lake, the third-largest fresh water lake in China, has been widely explored. However, information on metals in lake wetlands of the basin is lacking. Here, diffusive gradients in thin film (DGT), high-resolution dialysis technique (HR-Peeper) and traditional methods were jointly used to study the occurrence characteristics, pollution degree, bioavailability, and mobility of sediment metals in the northern lake wetlands of Jiaxing City in Taihu Lake Basin. The contents of Cr, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Cd and Pb were 101, 52.8, 62.3, 184, 10.3, 0.4, and 39.8 mg/kg, respectively. The metals in the sediments were in an overall low enrichment level. The main form of Cd was acid-soluble (F1), and the other metals mainly existed in residual (F4) or oxidable (F3) forms. The mean DGT-labile contents (CDGT) of Cr, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Cd and Pb were 1.3, 1.2, 9.3, 6.7, 13.4, 0.7, and 0.8 μg/L, respectively.

CDGT-Cr, CDGT-Cd, CDGT-Pb, and CDGT-Cu were significantly and positively related to CF1-Cr, CF1-Cd, CF1-Pb, and CF3-Cu, respectively. The stability of Cd was the worst with a mean risk assessment code of 40%, indicating a high risk of remobilization in the sediment. The remobilization risks of other metals were low or moderate. The CDGT/Csol ratio of Cd was also the largest, with a mean of 0.99, suggesting that the Cd resupplying ability from sediment solid to pore water was strong.",The distribution of novel bacterial laccases in alpine paleosols is directly related to soil stratigraphy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927724,The Science of the total environment,2019 05 01,"Bacterial laccases are now known to be abundant in soil and to function outside of the cell facilitating the bacterial degradation of lignin. In this study we wanted to test the hypotheses that: i) Such enzymes can be identified readily in stratified paleosols using metagenomics approaches, ii) The distribution of these genes as potential 'public good' proteins in soil is a function of the soil environment, iii) Such laccase genes can be readily retrieved and expressed in E. coli cloning systems to demonstrate that de novo assembly processes can be used to obtain similar metagenome-derived enzyme activities. To test these hypotheses, in silico gene-targeted assembly was employed to identify genes encoding novel type B two-domain bacterial laccases from alpine soil metagenomes sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq sequencer. The genes obtained from different strata were heterologously cloned, expressed and the gene products were shown to be active against two classical laccase substrates. The use of a metagenome-driven pipeline to obtain such active biocatalysts has demonstrated the potential for gene mining to be applied systematically for the discovery of such enzymes. These data ultimately further demonstrate the application of soil pedology methods to environmental enzyme discovery. As an interdisciplinary effort, we can now establish that paleosols can serve as a useful source of novel biocatalytic enzymes for various applications.

The aim of the present experiment was to evaluate: the effectiveness of compost application as a N fertilizer, the impact on N distribution in soil and plant and on tree performances, in a long-term experiment (14 years). The study was carried out in the Po valley, Italy and, since orchard planting (2001), the following treatments were applied: 1. unfertilized control; 2. mineral fertilization; 3. compost at a rate of 5 t DW ha-1 yr-1; 4. compost at a rate of 10 t DW ha-1 yr-1. Soil total N, potentially mineralizable, microbial and extractable N were higher in compost in comparison to mineral (fertilizer). The effect was found both in the row and in the inter-row and the rise of N fractions was evident in the shallowest soil layer of the row. Soil mineral, potentially mineralizable N was increased by mineral (11.1 mg kg-1) and compost 10 (12.4 mg kg-1) fertilization compared with control (6.7 mg kg-1). Vegetative growth and yield were increased in trees treated with mineral and compost 10; moreover, these plants were able to recycle (66.1 and 70.5 kg ha-1 yr-1, respectively) and remobilize (41.5 and 48.7 kg ha-1 yr-1, respectively) a higher amount of N than those of control and compost 5. In conclusion, organic fertilization strategy promoted the buildup of soil N reserve, meaning a capacity of the ecosystem to sequestrate N. The application of compost 10 showed a similar effect on plant growth and production as mineral fertilization, but introduced the advantage of the use of a cheap, renewable waste material, providing a new insight on N fertilization management.",Correlation between pubic bone mineral density and age from a computed tomography sample.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927722,Forensic science international,2019 05 29,"In forensic anthropology, the estimation of age at death is mainly required to establish a biological profile and facilitate individual identification. The Suchey-Brooks (SB) system represents one of the most commonly used and tested methods of assessment based on the morphological characteristics of the pubic symphysis. However, this method has certain drawbacks, including frequently inaccurate estimation for older individuals. The aim of this work was to test the evolution of pubic bone mineral density (BMD) according to age, especially for individuals over 40 years old. We retrospectively studied pubic bones from males (n = 88) and females (n = 113) over 40 years of age undergoing clinical multi-slice computed tomography (MSCT) in a French hospital between November 2017 and April 2018. The results revealed a significant negative correlation between BMD and age for males (R = -0.62) and females (R = -0.55). The intra- and inter-observer reliabilities of the phase allocation were moderate for males (kappa values at 0.72 and 0.65) and strong for females (kappa values at 0.93 and 0.86). Moreover, a significant difference in BMD between stages 6-1 and 6-2 for males was observed. We hypothesize that BMD might help improve the reliability of the SB system for older individuals. In addition to the pubic bone, numerous other anatomical regions such as the area of Ward could represent interesting areas of study in order to relate bone density to age.",Dental age estimation by different methods in patients with amelogenesis imperfecta.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927721,Forensic science international,2019 05 29,"Amelogenesis imperfecta (AI) is one of the developmental enamel defects. In patients with AI, as well as enamel defects, some dental anomalies are encountered and may affect tooth development. For children whose enamel structure is not normal, whether an accurate result can be obtained by dental age determination methods is not clear. The aims of this study are to determine the dental age for the assessment of tooth development in patients with AI by 3 different methods, to decide a method that will present the most accurate result to the chronological age, and to build a basis in terms of postmortem identification. The records of patients who were referred to the Department of Pediatric Dentistry between the years of 1999 and 2018, and diagnosed with AI were reviewed. At the age of 6-15 years, 58 patients (33 males-25 females) (Group I) with AI were determined. A total of 116 healthy individuals (66 males-50 females) (Group II) who were age and gender matched with the AI group were selected as the control group. Chronological age was calculated, and Nolla's, Demirjian's and Haavikko's methods were used to estimate dental age. Chronological and dental ages were compared according to the group and gender. The accuracy of three methods was also evaluated. There was no statistical significant differences for the tooth development in terms of group and gender. Dental age was over-estimated by Demirjian's method and under-estimated by Nolla's and Haavikko's methods. Haavikko's and Nolla's methods were more accurate in the dental age estimation. AI did not present an impact on the dental development. By using particularly Haavikko's method, the possible margin of error in evaluations of dental development can be reduced.

The radiographic evaluation of dental development is one of the most accepted tools for this purpose. Among the different methods proposed, Demirjian's method was the most extensively used and tested in the medical literature revealing that the original standards for the French-Canadian population tends to over-estimate the age of different population groups. The aims of this study were to evaluate the applicability of the Demirjian method in a sample of Italian children with Down syndrome (DS) and to compare the data with age and gender matched healthy subjects (non-DS). A retrospective study was performed on 146 orthopantomograms of DS individuals aged 6.3-16 years. The mean chronological age (CA) and the mean dental age (DA) were calculated. Using Cohen's kappa statistics, the inter- and intra-examiner agreement was reported as good (k = 0.75) and very good (k = 0.86). The differences between CAs and DAs were statistically significant for males and females (Wilcoxon Signed Rank test; p < 0.05). The median overestimation was 0.6 years in males and 0.9 years in females. Demirjian's method is unsuitable for dental age estimation in DS individuals. The same trend in overestimation was found in the control group. Comparing DS and non-DS subjects, the differences between DAs were not statistically significant for both males and females revealing that the dental development process is similar.",Identification of source mobile hand sets using audio latency feature.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927719,Forensic science international,2019 05 20,"An experiment has been carried out for determination of source of digital audio recording using audio latency feature of mobile phones.

B, Biology",2019 06 04,"Photobiomodulation (PBM) therapy is based on the use of specific light parameters to promote tissue repair. Although demonstrated in different cell models and tissues, the mechanism by which photobiomodulation operates is not well understood. Previous studies suggested that the cell proliferation enhancement triggered by red and near-infrared PBM involves the activation of the mitochondrial respiratory chain enzyme cytochrome c oxidase (CCO). It was suggested that light in this range would displace inhibitory nitric oxide bound to CCO. To test this mechanism, we took advantage of cell lines lacking CCO, including a mouse line knockout for Cox10 (a gene required for the synthesis of heme a, the prosthetic group of CCO) and a human cell line with an mtDNA mutation in the tRNA Lysine gene, leading to mitochondrial protein synthesis impairment and the lack of three critical CCO subunits. In both models we showed the complete absence of assembled CCO. PBM (660 nm) was applied to these proliferating cells using various parameters. In most of the conditions tested, increased cell proliferation was associated with PBM in both control and CCO negative cells, demonstrating that CCO is not required for PBM enhancement of cellular proliferation. Additional experiments showed that PBM increased both ATP levels and citrate synthase activity and levels. These results showed that although metabolic changes are associated with PBM, CCO is not required for its cell proliferation enhancing effect.","Highly photoluminescent N, P doped carbon quantum dots as a fluorescent sensor for the detection of dopamine and temperature.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927703,"Journal of photochemistry and photobiology. B, Biology",2019 06 04,"In recent times, fluorescent carbon quantum dots (CQDs) as an optical sensor have attained massive attention owing to their excellent optical properties. In current investigation, our group presented an easy and economical methodology to synthesize the nitrogen and phosphorous doped carbon quantum dots (N, P doped CQDs) for sensing dopamine (DA) and temperature in aqueous medium. The synthesized CQDs were characterized by using XRD, XPS, TEM, UV-Vis, FT-IR and fluorescence techniques. The N, P doped CQDs were synthesized via one-step microwave digestion method by using citric acid, ethylenediamine and urea phosphate as precursors. This method established the noble water solubility, good optical performances and fluorescence thermosensitivity of N, P doped CQDs. Also, N, P doped CQDs demonstrated a wide linear range of 10-500 μM (R2 = 0.994) and offered an electrifying detection limit of 0.021 μM for quantifying the dopamine. Moreover, this sensor possessed a good sensitivity, reversibility and linearity in the range of 10-70 °C. In addition, the CQDs sensing system repel the interference from probable foreign substances in real sample analysis, and attained good recoveries, which revealed the tremendous selectivity and adequate accuracy of the carbon quantum dots for sensing dopamine. The proposed N, P doped CQDs are simple as well as effective optical nanosensor and clasps venerable potential to widen the applications in analysis of biomolecules and other areas.",Blue photosensitizers for aPDT eliminate Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans in the absence of light: An in vitro study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927702,"Journal of photochemistry and photobiology. B, Biology",2019 06 04,"The main treatment of periodontal disease is the mechanical removal of supra and subgingival biofilm. Adjuvant therapies as antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) may offer improved clinical and microbiological results. The aim of this in vitro study was to evaluate the effect of toluidine and methylene blue dyes, associated with red laser and LED, on elimination of a suspension of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (A.a). Experimental groups (n = 29) consisted of positive (broth) and negative (gentamicin) controls, three different dyes concentrations (0.05; 0.1; 10 mg/ml) alone or associated with laser (660 nm) at two power settings (70 and 100 mW) and LED (627 ± 10 nm). Bacterial suspension received all treatments, and after serial dilutions they were cultured for 24 h in petri dishes for colony forming unit counts. Data were analyzed by ANOVA complemented by Tukey's test (p < 0.05). The results showed that both dyes, at a concentration of 10 mg/ml, alone or associated with laser and LED, caused 100% of death similar to the negative control (p > 0.05). It can be concluded that blue dyes for aPDT, at high concentration (10 mg/ml), are capable of eliminating A.a without adjuvant use of light sources.",Modulation of eNOS/iNOS by nebivolol protects against cyclosporine A-mediated nephrotoxicity through targeting inflammatory and apoptotic pathways.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927701,Environmental toxicology and pharmacology,2019 06 08,"The aim of this study was to investigate effect of nitric oxide (NO) modulation on possible nephroprotective mechanisms of nebivolol (NEB) in cyclosporine A (CsA)-induced nephrotoxicity. Rats were treated with 20 mg/kg/day s.c. of CsA for 21 days, with NEB alone (10 mg/kg/day orally) or together with a NOS inhibitor, L-NAME (10 mg/kg/day i.p.). NEB conferred nephroprotection against CsA-induced toxicity, significantly decreasing serum kidney function tests and improving renal histopathology. NEB showed antioxidant effects, by significantly decreasing renal malondialdehyde levels, while increasing reduced glutathione levels and catalase activity. NEB showed anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects; reducing renal expression NF-κB and fas ligand. NEB also reversed CsA-induced effects on NO system; increasing renal NO level, with up-regulation of eNOS and down-regulation of iNOS expression. Administering L-NAME with NEB reversed all beneficial effects of NEB. Thus, NEB's modulation of NO system in CsA-induced nephrotoxicity might be the triggering mechanism controlling NEB's nephroprotective effect.",Hippocampal gene expression patterns linked to late-life physical activity oppose age and AD-related transcriptional decline.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927700,Neurobiology of aging,2019 06 13,"Exercise has emerged as a powerful variable that can improve cognitive function and delay age-associated cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease (AD); however, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. To determine if protective mechanisms may occur at the transcriptional level, we used microarrays to investigate the relationship between physical activity levels and gene expression patterns in the cognitively intact aged human hippocampus. In parallel, hippocampal gene expression patterns associated with aging and AD were assessed using publicly available microarray data profiling hippocampus from young (20-59 years), cognitively intact aging (73-95 years) and age-matched AD cases. To identify ""anti-aging/AD"" transcription patterns associated with physical activity, probesets significantly associated with both physical activity and aging/AD were identified and their directions of expression change in each condition were compared. Remarkably, of the 2210 probesets significant in both data sets, nearly 95% showed opposite transcription patterns with physical activity compared with aging/AD. The majority (>70%) of these anti-aging/AD genes showed increased expression with physical activity and decreased expression in aging/AD. Enrichment analysis of the anti-aging/AD genes showing increased expression in association with physical activity revealed strong overrepresentation of mitochondrial energy production and synaptic function, along with axonal function and myelin integrity. Synaptic genes were notably enriched for synaptic vesicle priming, release and recycling, glutamate and GABA signaling, and spine plasticity. Anti-aging/AD genes showing decreased expression in association with physical activity were enriched for transcription-related function (notably negative regulation of transcription). These data reveal that physical activity is associated with a more youthful profile in the hippocampus across multiple biological processes, providing a potential molecular foundation for how physical activity can delay age- and AD-related decline of hippocampal function.",Synthesis and characterization of novel bithiazolidine derivatives-capped CdTe/CdS quantum dots used as a novel Hg2+ fluorescence sensor.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927699,"Spectrochimica acta.

Then, the CdTe@CdS QDs and DTM capped CdTe@CdS QDs were produced. The DTM-CdTe@CdS/QDs used as an effective fluorescence sensing material due to the selective interaction of DTM with Hg (II). The results indicated that the DTM-CdTe@CdS/QDs shows strong fluorescence emissions in the absence of mercury ions and efficiently quenched in presence of Hg2, with the formation of a strong and stable complex between Hg2+ and DTM. Experimental results showed that under optimal conditions, Hg2+ could be detected with a detection limit of 0.08 nM in a linear range from 0.3 nM to 21 nM. The constructed aptasensor illustrated the high selectivity for mercury ions even in the presence of the other interfering metal ions when their concentration ratio was more than 300 times. The satisfactory results illustrated that the designed fluorescence sensor as a sensitive, reliable and easy to use approach could be applied for the facile and rapid determination of Hg2+ in tap water.",Postoperative cognitive dysfunction is rare after fast-track hip- and knee arthroplasty - But potentially related to opioid use.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927698,Journal of clinical anesthesia,2019 05 07,"Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) remains a frequent postoperative complication in non-fast-track surgeries, with negative implications for return to daily activities and work.

Genetics,2019 06 04,"The Hui group is the second largest ethnic minority and one of the most widespread ethnic groups in China. However, the genetic architecture of the Hui population remains largely unexplored, particularly with respect to the male-specific region of the Y chromosome. Here, we studied nine Hui populations (Xinjiang, Qinghai, Gansu, Ningxia, Shaanxi, Henan, Shandong, Sichuan, Yunnan) using 157 Y-chromosome single nucleotide polymorphisms (Y-SNPs) and 27 short tandem repeats (Y-STRs) to unravel their genetic substructure and forensic characteristics. A total of 650 unrelated male samples from the Hui populations were genotyped by SNaPshot®, a single base extension (SBE) assay. Finally, 95 terminal haplogroups and high haplotype diversity (0.9999) were observed in Hui populations. Frequency heat map matrices, genetic distance (FST) and network analysis within Hui populations indicated that these nine Hui populations can be divided into three groups: Hui populations from the northwest (NWH), Hui populations from Sichuan and Shandong (SSH), and Hui populations from Yunnan (YNH). Our results suggested that we should use different databases for different Hui samples in forensic cases. Comparison with other populations that used different population genetic analysis revealed that the Hui populations had close relationships with East Asian populations, especially Chinese Han population. Overall, the high-resolution panel with Y-SNPs and Y-STRs gives new and complete insight into Hui populations, which can be used to interpret the genetic substructure of Hui populations and affect the utility of forensic databases.",Mechanical Communication Acts as a Noise Filter.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927696,iScience,2019 04 27,"Cells can communicate mechanically by responding to mechanical deformations generated by their neighbors. Here, we describe a new role for mechanical communication by demonstrating that mechanical coupling between cells acts as a signaling cue that reduces intrinsic noise in the interacting cells. We measure mechanical interaction between beating cardiac cells cultured on a patterned flexible substrate and find that beat-to-beat variability decays exponentially with coupling strength. To demonstrate that such noise reduction is indeed a direct consequence of mechanical coupling, we reproduce the exponential decay in an assay where a beating cell interacts mechanically with an artificial stochastic 'mechanical cell'. The mechanical cell consists of a probe that mimics the deformations generated by a stochastically beating neighboring cardiac cell. We show that noise reduction through mechanical coupling persists long after stimulation stops and identify microtubule integrity, NOX2, and CaMKII as mediators of noise reduction.",Online interpersonal sexual objectification experiences and Chinese adolescent girls' intuitive eating: The role of broad conceptualization of beauty and body appreciation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927695,Eating behaviors,2019 05 26,"Interpersonal sexual objectification experiences are pervasive in online communication contexts, and their influence on positive eating behaviors should not be ignored. Broad conceptualization of beauty refers to how widely women and girls define female beauty in terms of both internal and external characteristics, and body appreciation refers to loving, respecting, and holding a positive attitude toward the body. This study examined the association between online interpersonal sexual objectification (OISO) experiences and intuitive eating, as well as the mediating role of broad conceptualization of beauty and body appreciation. Participants were 1152 Chinese adolescent girls aged 11 to 15 years who completed a questionnaire survey measuring OISO experiences, broad conceptualization of beauty, body appreciation, and intuitive eating. The results showed a negative association of OISO experiences with broad conceptualization of beauty and intuitive eating. Mediation analysis using structural equation modeling showed a negative association of OISO experiences with intuitive eating through broad conceptualization of beauty and body appreciation. These results suggest that programs aiming to improve healthy eating behaviors could direct adolescent girls to criticize the appearance-focused mindset in online interaction and encourage them to focus on body functionality, such as health, creative endeavors, and communication with others."

A total of 53 transcripts were differentially expressed (P-value <.05): 40 showed up-regulation and 13 showed down-regulation in HIGH pHu carcasses. Four up-regulated (PDK4, GADD45B, MAOA, METTL21C) genes were confirmed (P < .05) by q-PCR. HIGH pHu samples resulted with lower values in glycolytic potential and AMP-activated protein kinase activity compared to NORMAL at 0.5 and 24 h postmortem (P < .05). Functional pathway analysis showed that calcium transport and GADD45 signaling pathways are associated with the development of HIGH pH meat. Genes involved in stress-related signaling, such as GADD45B, METTL21C and MAOA were overexpressed. These genes are involved in stress signaling that might be affecting Ca2+ transport and oxidative metabolism pathways in HIGH pH muscles.",Predictors of shoulder pain in manual wheelchair users.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927682,"Clinical biomechanics (Bristol, Avon)",2019 05 17,"Manual wheelchair users rely on their upper limbs to provide independent mobility, which leads to high muscular demand on their upper extremities and often results in shoulder pain and injury.

The purpose of this study was to determine in a longitudinal setting whether there are specific biomechanical measures that predict shoulder pain development in manual wheelchair users.","Effects of sinapic acid on hepatic cytochrome P450 3A2, 2C11, and intestinal P-glycoprotein on the pharmacokinetics of oral carbamazepine in rats: Potential food/herb-drug interaction.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927680,Epilepsy research,2019 05 03,"Dietary supplements, herbal medicines, and other foods may affect the pharmacokinetics and/or pharmacodynamics of carbamazepine (CBZ), which may possibly lead to potential drug-drug/herb-drug interactions, as CBZ has a narrow therapeutic window. Sinapic acid (SA) is a bioactive phytoconstituent used as a dietary supplement for the treatment of epilepsy. This study determined the effects of SA on the pharmacokinetics of CBZ and proposed a possible interaction mechanism in twenty-four male wistar rats (180-210 g). A single CBZ dose (80 mg/kg) was administered orally to rats with or without SA pretreatment (20 mg/kg p.o. per day for 7 days, n = 6). The CBZ concentration in plasma samples was determined by using a sensitive reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography assay. The pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated by using non-compartmental analysis. Significance was determined through Dunnett's multiple comparison test or one-way analysis of variance as appropriate; p < 0.05 were considered significant. The change in the pharmacokinetic parameters (Cmax, Tmax, AUC0-t, AUC0-∞, T½, and kel) of CBZ was evaluated after the administration of CBZ alone or after CBZ co-administration with SA pretreatment. The plasma concentration of CBZ was higher after SA pretreatment than that without pretreatment. The pharmacokinetics of orally administered CBZ were found to be significantly altered (p < 0.05) in rats pretreated with SA compared to those in rats administered CBZ alone. The increases in the Cmax, AUC0-t, T1/2, and MRT of CBZ were 29.79%, 57.18%, 77.18%, and 58.31%, respectively, whereas the kel and apparent oral CL/F were significantly reduced (p < 0.05) in rats pretreated with SA compared to those in rats not pretreated with SA (43.87% and 42.50%, respectively). However, no significant change was observed in the Tmax of CBZ in rats pretreated with SA compared to that in rats that did not receive pretreatment. The enhancement in Cmax, AUC0-t, T1/2, and MRT and the reduction in Kel and CL/F values resulted from the significant inhibition of CYP3 A2, the CYP2C11-mediated metabolism of CBZ in the liver, and the inhibition of intestinal P-glycoprotein/MDR1, which enhanced the rate of CBZ absorption. Further studies are required to determine the clinical relevance of these observations.",A novel ultrasensitive electrochemiluminescence biosensor for glutathione detection based on poly-L-lysine as co-reactant and graphene-based poly(luminol/aniline) as nanoprobes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927679,Biosensors & bioelectronics,2019 04 16,"In this work, an ultrasensitive electrochemiluminescence (ECL) biosensor was constructed using poly-L-lysine (PLL) as a novel co-reactant of luminol and poly(luminol/aniline) nanorods loaded reduced graphene oxide (PLA@rGO) as nanoprobe, which enable highly sensitivity detection of glutathione (GSH). To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time that PLL was used for the co-reactant of luminol. Notably, about a 5-fold enhancement was obtained compared with the individual PLA@rGO using GCE. Due to the remarkable quenching effect between the excited state of PLL and the reduced form of GSH in the ECL system of luminol/PLL, the ECL sensing platform exhibited wide linear ranges of 1.0 × 10-9-1.0 × 10-4 M and 1.0 × 10-4-1.0 × 10-2 M and a low detection limit of 7.7 × 10-10 M.

We used compound-specific nitrogen isotope analysis of amino acids (CSIA-AA), with which we expected to obtain precise TPs, to estimate the TMFs of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) in the pelagic and benthic food webs of Tokyo Bay. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the difference between TMFs derived from TPs estimated by CSIA-AA (TPGlu/Phe) and TMFs derived from TPs estimated by bulk stable isotope analysis (TPbulk). TPGlu/Phe tended to be lower than TPbulk for many pelagic and benthic fishes. In the pelagic food web, the slopes for the relationships between PCB concentrations and TPGlu/Phe exceeded those between PCB concentrations and TPbulk for many congeners in samples from December 2014, and TMFGlu/Phe values (0.89-6.9) were higher than TMFbulk values (0.92-3.8). However, there were no statistically significant differences between the slopes of the relationships between PCB and PBDE concentrations and TPbulk or TPGlu/Phe for any of the congeners (analysis of covariance, P ≥ 0.08). In the benthic food web, PCB concentrations correlated with TPGlu/Phe for 9 PCB congeners in the samples collected during December 2014, although the concentrations of none of the PCB congeners correlated with TPbulk. A decrease of TMFGlu/Phe and TMFbulk values from December 2014 to May 2015 suggested that variation of PCB and PBDE concentrations in the organisms had more effect than TPs on the TMFs.",Occurrence of PPCPs in a Brazilian water reservoir and their removal efficiency by ecological filtration.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927673,Chemosphere,2019 05 07,"The presence of PPCPs (Pharmaceuticals and Personal Care Products) in water sources and drinking water has concerned researchers in recent times.

There were 3 spiking events of PPCPs (2 μg L-1) in the ecological filter influents conducted with a lag period of 15 days between spikes. Water samples were collected from the influent and effluent of the filters at 3, 6 and 24 h after each spiking event. All target PPCPs were identified in the Lobo reservoir water in the range of μg L-1. The personal care products were detected with 100% frequency in the samples, and in higher concentrations compared to the pharmaceuticals. Degradation products of diclofenac and benzophenone-3 were identified in the water samples. Results of this investigation show that ecological filtration was an effective process (70-99%) to remove 2 μg L-1 of the selected PPCPs, and demonstrated that the filters were resilient to individual compounds and to their mixtures.",GSTO1 acts as a mediator in sodium fluoride-induced alterations of learning and memory related factors expressions in the hippocampus cell line.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927672,Chemosphere,2019 05 07,"The mechanism of GSTO1, as a high-risk factor for neurological damage, in sodium fluoride (NaF)-induced learning and memory impairment remained still unclear.

In addition, our results showed that exposure to 10-3, 10-4, and 10-5 moL/l NaF increased GSTO1 mRNA and protein expression, but decreased CREB and BDNF expression levels in a dose and time-dependent manner. The mRNA and protein expressions of GSTO1, CREB and BDNF were significantly decreased in the siRNA-GSTO1 and NaF + siRNA-GSTO1 group (P < 0.05). We have shown that various NaF doses affected the learning and memory ability by down-regulation the expressions of CREB, BDNF, NCAM and SCF. In summary, we concluded that GSTO1 plays a mediator role in NaF-induced neurological damage."

One facet of this debate is whether or not the creation of cognitive maps - also known as allocentric navigation - involves reinforcement learning. Here, we demonstrate a role for reinforcement learning during allocentric navigation using event-related brain potentials (ERPs). In the present experiment, participants navigated in a virtual environment that allowed the use of three different navigation strategies (allocentric, egocentric-response, & egocentric-cue), in which their goal was to locate and remember a hidden platform. Following the navigation phase of the experiment, participants were shown ""cue images"" representative of the three navigation strategies. Specifically, we examined whether or not these passively learned strategy images elicited a reward positivity - an ERP component associated with reinforcement learning and the anterior cingulate cortex. We found that when allocentric navigators were shown previously learned cues predicting the goal location a reward positivity was elicited. The present findings demonstrate that allocentric navigational cues carry long-term value after navigation and lend support to the claim that reinforcement learning plays a role in the acquisition of allocentric navigation and thus the generation of cognitive maps.",Choking under experimenter's presence: Impact on proactive control and practical consequences for psychological science.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927658,Cognition,2019 06 08,"Evidence accumulated for more than a century on audience effects shows that being watched by others typically impairs performance on difficult tasks. However, recent research under the label of « choking under pressure » suggests that this performance impairment is, ironically, specific to the individuals who are the most qualified to succeed-those with a high working memory capacity (WMC). Here, we predicted and found that being watched by evaluative others such as the experimenter undermines proactive control on which the high-WMC individuals rely the more. These results refine our understanding of both audience and choking effects, and lead to innovative, practical recommendations for psychological science.",Braille readers break mirror invariance for both visual Braille and Latin letters.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927657,Cognition,2019 06 08,"For this study, we started from the observation that the poor adequacy of a script to the requirements of the human visual system strongly impacts some aspects of reading expertise (e.g., fluent reading). Here we investigated another of these aspects, namely the ability to break mirror invariance, which makes it hard for readers to ignore the mirrored contrasts of letters even if this hinders performance. In particular, we hypothesized that this ability would be preserved for the visually presented letters of the Braille alphabet despite their poor fit to the constraints of the human visual system, as it did for congenital Braille readers when they explored the same letters through the tactile modality (de Heering, Collignon, & Kolinsky, 2018). To test so, we measured visual Braille readers' mirror costs, indexing for their difficulty to consider mirrored items as identical compared to strictly identical items, for three materials: Braille letters, geometrical shapes and Latin letters, which invariant properties are typically considered as having been selected through cultural evolution because they match the requirements of the visual system. Contrary to people having never experienced Braille, Braille readers' mirror cost was of the same magnitude for Latin letters and Braille letters and steadily increased the more they had experience with the latter material. Both these costs were also stronger than what was observed for geometrical shapes. Overall these results suggest that the poor adequacy of the Braille alphabet to the visual system does not impede Braille readers to break mirror invariance for the Braille material.","Time pressure disrupts level-2, but not level-1, visual perspective calculation: A process-dissociation analysis.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927656,Cognition,2019 06 08,"Reasoning about other people's mental states has long been assumed to require active deliberation. Yet, evidence from indirect measures suggests that adults and children commonly display behavior indicative of having incidentally calculated both what other agents see (level-1 perspective taking) and how they see it (level-2 perspective taking). Here, we investigated the efficiency of such perspective calculation in adults. In four experiments using indirect measures of visual perspective taking, we imposed time pressure to constrain processing opportunity, and we used process-dissociation analyses to isolate perspective calculation as the process of focal interest. Results revealed that time pressure weakened level-2, but not level-1, perspective calculation-a pattern that was not evident in error-rate analyses. These findings suggest that perspective calculation may operate more efficiently in level-1 than in level-2 perspective taking. They also highlight the utility of the process-dissociation framework for unmasking processes that otherwise may go under-detected in behavior-level analyses.","A bioarchaeological and biocultural investigation of Chinese footbinding at the Xuecun archaeological site, Henan Province, China.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927655,International journal of paleopathology,2019 06 10,"From 2005-2006 the Institute of Cultural Relics and Archaeology, Henan Province, excavated the Xuecun cemetery as part of a salvage archaeology project associated with the South to North Water Diversion Project. This gave a unique opportunity to examine burials from the Ming-Qing Dynasties (1360-1911). Burials from this period are seldom excavated as the Chinese, do not want to disturb their direct ancestors. This is one of the first studies to examine the paleopathological consequences for footbinding in China. A total of 202 individuals were analyzed for evidence of bound feet: including the loss of musculature in the legs, alterations to muscle attachments, changes in the morphology of the tarsals, metatarsals, and phalanges, and signs of infection and trauma. Length and width measurements of tarsals, metatarsal, and phalanges were taken from all females with observable bones. T-test results confirmed a significant difference in tarsal and metatarsal length/width. The incidence of footbinding also increased through time from no evidence in the Han Dynasty, Tang Dynasty, Song Dynasty, and Jin Dynasty, to a dramatic increase in the late Ming Dynasty to Qing Dynasty.",A case of erosive polyarthropathy from Medieval northern Italy (12th-13th centuries).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927654,International journal of paleopathology,2019 06 10,To evaluate and differentially diagnose erosive skeletal lesions located on multiple joints of an individual archaeologically recovered in 2017.,Complete recovery of cellulose from rice straw pretreated with ethylene glycol and aluminum chloride for enzymatic hydrolysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927653,Bioresource technology,2019 04 22,"Rice straw was pretreated with ethylene glycol (EG) and AlCl3 for enzymatic hydrolysis. EG-AlCl3 pretreatment had an extremely good selectivity for component fractionation, resulting in 88% delignification and 90% hemicellulose removal, with 100% cellulose recovered or 76% (w/w) cellulose content in solid residue at 150 °C with 0.055 mol/L AlCl3. The pretreated residue (5%, w/v) presented a higher enzymatic hydrolysis rate (glucose yield increased 2 times to 94%) for 24 h at cellulase loading of 10 FPU/g. The hydrolysis behavior was correlated with the composition and structure of substrates characterized by SEM, FT-IR, BET, XRD and TGA. The enzyme adsorption ability of pretreated straw was 12-folds that for the original sample. EG-AlCl3 solution was further cycled for 3 times with 100% cellulose recovery but only 29% lignin removal due to the loss of AlCl3.

The coupled effect of ammonium, temperature and pH on lipids accumulation was a core issue during algal culture using anaerobic wastewater. Therefore, their combined effects on Chlorella pyrenoidosa culture and lipids accumulation in anaerobic effluent were investigated. Free ammonia induced from the rising pH and temperature inhibited algal growth, but significantly promoted lipid accumulation. The highest lipids content reached 30.2% when pH rose to 8.3-8.5 (25 °C, ammonium 280 mg/L), which was 1.6-fold higher than that under neutral condition. Moreover, the percentage of unsaturated fatty acids (un-SFAs) increased to 74.8-77.9% at pH 8.3-8.5, whereas it was only 56.1-58.9% under neutral condition. The C18:2 and C18:3 dominated the un-SFAs increase at high pH, typically the percentage of C18:3 increased by 74.5-153.1%. This study provides a potential way for lipid accumulation in algal culture using anaerobic wastewater."

Emerging evidence also indicates a regulatory role of Notch signaling in prostate development, differentiation, and growth. However, the collaborative regulatory mechanisms of androgen and Notch signaling during prostate development, growth, and regeneration are largely unknown. Hairy and Enhancer of Split 1 (Hes1) is a transcriptional regulator of Notch signaling pathways, and its expression is responsive to Notch signaling. Hes1-expressing cells have been shown to possess the regenerative capability to repopulate a variety of adult tissues. In this study, we developed new mouse models to directly assess the role of the androgen receptor in prostatic Hes1-expressing cells. Selective deletion of AR expression in embryonic Hes1-expressing cells impeded early prostate development both in vivo and in tissue xenograft experiments. Prepubescent deletion of AR expression in Hes1-expressing cells resulted in prostate glands containing abnormalities in cell morphology and gland architecture. A population of castration-resistant Hes1-expressing cells was revealed in the adult prostate, with the ability to repopulate prostate epithelium following androgen supplementation. Deletion of AR in Hes1-expressing cells diminishes their regenerative ability. These lines of evidence demonstrate a critical role for the AR in Notch-responsive cells during the course of prostate development, morphogenesis, and regeneration, and implicate a mechanism underlying interaction between the androgen and Notch signaling pathways in the mouse prostate.",Propulsion strategy in running in children and adolescents with cerebral palsy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927640,Gait & posture,2019 04 25,Running is a fundamental movement skill important for participation in physical activity.

Interestingly, bivalves such as Perna viridis have been reported to exhibit some resistances to alleviate toxic effects of DSP toxins in a species-specific manner. Nevertheless, the molecular mechanisms underlying the resistance phenomenon to DSP toxins, particularly the mechanistic role of CYP450 is scant despite its crucial role in detoxification. Here, we exposed P. viridis to Prorocentrum lima and examined the expression pattern of the CYP450 and our comprehensive analyses revealed that P. lima exposure resulted in unique expression pattern of key CYP450 genes in bivalves. Exposure to P. lima (2 × 105 cells/L) dramatically orchestrated the relative expression of CYP450 genes. CYP2D14-like mRNA was significantly down-regulated at 6 h in gill, but up-regulated at 2 h in digestive gland compared with control counterparts (p < 0.05), while CYP3A4 mRNA was increased at 12 h in gill. After exposure to P. lima at 2 × 106 cells/L, the expression of CYP3A4 mRNA was significantly increased in digestive gland at 2 h and 12 h, while CYP2D14-like was up-regulated at 6 h. Besides, CYP3L3 and CYP2C8 also exhibited differential expression. These data suggested that CYP3A4, CYP2D14-like, and even CYP3L3 and CYP2C8 might be involved in DSP toxins metabolism. Besides, provision of ketoconazole resulted in significant decrement of CYP3A4 in digestive gland at 2 h and 12 h, while the OA content significantly decreased at 2 h and 6 h compared to control group without ketoconazole. These findings indicated that ketoconazole could depress CYP3A4 activity in bivalves thereby altering the metabolic activities of DSP toxins in bivalves, and also provided novel insights into the mechanistic role of CYP3A4 on DSP toxins metabolism in bivalves.",Simultaneous removal of elemental mercury and NO by mercury induced thermophilic community in membrane biofilm reactor.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927638,Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,2019 06 07,"Thermophilic membrane biofilm reactor (TMBR) for elemental mercury (Hg0) and NO removal in simulated flue gas was investigated at oxygen content of 6% and 60 °C. The performance, the microbial community structures, gene function and the mechanism for Hg0 and NO removal in the TMBR were evaluated. TMBR achieved effective simultaneous Hg0 and NO removal in 210 days of operation, Hg0 and NO removal efficiency were up to 88.9% and 85.3%, respectively. Mercury induced thermophilic community had been formed significantly. Comamonas, Pseudomonas, Desulfomicrobium, Burkholderia and Halomonas were thermophilic mercury resistant bacteria. Brucella, Paracoccus, Tepidiphilus, Proteobacteria, Pseudomonas and Symbiobacterium were nitrifying/denitrifying genera, and had functional genes of mercury and nitrogen metabolism, as shown by16S rDNA and metagenomic sequencing. The biofilm in TMBR was characterized by XPS, HPLC. XPS and HPLC spectra indicate the formation of a mercuric species (Hg2+) from mercury oxidation. TMBR used oxygen as electron acceptor, NO and Hg0 as electron donor in nitrification; O2, NO and NO3- could be used as electron acceptor and Hg0 as electron donor in denitrification.",Bioaccumulation and distribution of cadmium by Burkholderia cepacia GYP1 under oligotrophic condition and mechanism analysis at proteome level.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927637,Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,2019 06 06,"Bacteria have been applied for the bioremediation of cadmium-contaminated environment. Less is known about the bioaccumulation of high concentration of Cd over time under the oligotrophic environment. Burkholderia cepacia GYP1, which was isolated from multiple heavy metal contaminated farmland, was studied for its bioaccumulation mechanism of Cd under oligotrophic condition. GYP1 possessed highly accumulation capacity for cadmium reaching 116 mg Cd/g biomass (dry weight). ATR-FTIR, electron microscopy, flow cytometry along with subcellular fraction demonstrated that the uptake and distribution of cadmium varied with the increased amount of cadmium of GYP1 cell during the 7-day treatment time: the accumulation of cadmium was mainly on the outer membrane at the beginning (within 1 day), and the intracellular cadmium kept increased and held stable after 2 days, after that, the increased amount of cadmium mainly located extracellularly, related to the secreted EPS. Further mechanism analysis of bioaccumulation of Cd by GYP1 based on iTRAQ-based proteomics showed that Cd(II) could trigger the up-regulation of the Cd2+/Zn2+-exporting ATPase, type VI protein secretion systems, and glutathione-S-transferase that are related to cadmium response, which may contribute to maintain the intracellular cadmium homeostasis. In summary, the immobilization of Cd(II) by B. cepacia GYP1 contains three steps:(1) fast immobilization of Cd(II) on the cell surface coordinated with functional groups, (2) transport of Cd(II) to cells and accumulation in cytoplasm, and (3) efflux of intracellular Cd(II) depended on energy and the entrapped or adsorbed of extracellular Cd(II) by EPS. Our study provided the understanding of the cadmium accumulation process of B. cepacia GYP1 under oligotrophic condition, which would be helpful in bioremediation of natural cadmium contaminated environment.",Everywhere and nowhere: Work-based learning in healthcare education.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927635,Nurse education in practice,2019 05 19,"The shortage of healthcare professions is a global issue, which has highlighted the need to establish effective practice learning. In 2015 the UK government introduced a change to the way that healthcare education is funded. A subsequent fall in applications to healthcare programmes and high levels of vacancies across the sector in the UK have led to widespread concern about workforce shortages, especially nurses. Subsequently, initiatives that both address the shortage and aim to bridge the gap between registered nurse and healthcare support worker have been introduced, presenting opportunities to further develop the clinical workplace as a learning environment for employees. A sample of nine healthcare professionals was recruited; seven nurses and two allied health professionals. Semi-structured interviews were conducted between March and June 2018. These were recorded verbatim, transcribed and thematically analysed. Respondents identified opportunities for work-based learning and factors for success. The importance of an effective learning culture, commitment to work-based learning and time were identified as factors for success. Despite the richness of learning opportunities in healthcare, respondents identified challenges for both learners and supervisors in identifying these opportunities in the workplace. These findings have immediate relevance to healthcare education systems internationally. Areas for future research include the relationship between supervisor and learner and further insight into why the busiest areas might be identified as more effective learning environments.",Knowledge and attitudes towards breastfeeding practices: A cross-sectional survey of postnatal mothers in China.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927634,Midwifery,2019 04 30,To examine the mothers' knowledge and attitudes toward breastfeeding and highlight barriers to exclusive breastfeeding in Chinese postpartum mothers.,Postnatal depression and infant growth in an urban area of Bangladesh.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927633,Midwifery,2019 04 30,"Postnatal depression (PND) has been a common depressive mental disorder among the mothers in a low-income country like Bangladesh where stunting, underweight and wasting are prevalent among infants.

Findings show that after adjusting for all covariates, Malay and Indian males in later-born cohorts have an increased number of mobility limitations compared to earlier-born cohorts. While a similar trend was also found for Chinese males and females in unconditional models, these were fully mediated by sociodemographic and health variables.

Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) remains the standard of care for the treatment of most cases of atherosclerotic coronary artery disease (CAD). Intracoronary stents, either bare metal (BMS) or drug eluting (DES), can successfully treat luminal stenoses within the coronary arteries. Following successful PCI however, neointimal proliferation can develop within the deployed stent. Similar to the pathophysiology of native vessel atherosclerosis there is chronic inflammation within the neointima with infiltration of macrophages, a process called neoatherosclerosis, and can result in in-stent restenosis (ISR) and even acute thrombotic, coronary arterial occlusion following disruption of the neoatheroma.

In this work, nanomechanical properties of three different specimens were determined using four different AFM probes with spherical and flat-ended tips and conical tips with rounded apexes, to provide useful information for probe selection and for better interpretation of force-indentation data. These probes were modeled as a sphere, flat punch, and hyperboloid, respectively, after careful characterization to determine the elastic modulus based on contact models. Polyacrylic acid, polyvinylidene fluoride, and styrene-butadiene rubber were used as specimens. The results showed that the probe with a flat-ended tip was prone to misalignment between the flat end of the tip and specimen surface, which caused that the force-indentation data could not be interpreted using the contact model due to imperfect contact. Also, hysteresis was consistently observed in force-indentation data for the probes with a spherical tip and conical tips with rounded apexes, likely due to friction. This further resulted in significant differences in the elastic moduli of the specimens as large as 22-100% as determined from extension and retraction curves. The elastic moduli approximated by the mean of those from the extension and retraction curves generally agree with those from the instrumented indentation. Considering the uncertainties associated with the modeling of tip shape and force and indentation measurements, the probe with relatively large tip radius (e.g., ∼30 nm) was recommended for more accurate measurement for the specimen with a few GPa elastic modulus. Furthermore, the difference between elastic moduli determined from extension and retraction curves was found to increase as the ratio of contact stiffness to flexural stiffness of the AFM probe decreased. The outcome of this work is expected to provide useful information for obtaining accurate mechanical property measurements using an AFM based on a better understanding of the interaction between AFM probe and specimen.",Value-added carbohydrate building blocks by regioselective O-alkylation of C-glucosyl compounds.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927609,Carbohydrate research,2019 04 27,"Functionalized carbohydrates and especially functionalized C-glycosides are useful intermediates for the synthesis of complex carbohydrates of interest. In this paper, we describe the synthesis of C-azidopropylglucopyranosides and give a full account of their regioselective acylation and alkylation. Alkylation of these C-glucosyl compounds containing 1,2-trans-diol, namely 2- and 3-OH were first optimized with benzyl bromide. The reaction has then been extended to various electrophiles thus providing 3-O-substituted C-glucosyl compounds. These results are one of the first examples of regioselective alkylation with functionalized electrophiles on glycosyl compounds featuring a trans-vicinal diol. Furthermore, we describe some results obtained during regioselective deprotection of 4,6-O-benzylidene protecting group.

Clinical,2019 06 15,"The extent and spatial location of white matter hyperintensities (WMH) on brain MRI may be relevant to the development of cognitive decline in older persons. Here, we introduce a new method, known as the Multi-atlas based Detection and Localization (MADL), to evaluate WMH on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) data. This method simultaneously parcellates the whole brain into 143 structures and labels hyperintense areas within each WM structure. First, a multi-atlas library was established with FLAIR data of normal elderly brains; and then a multi-atlas fusion algorithm was developed by which voxels with locally abnormal intensities were detected as WMH. At the same time, brain segmentation maps were generated from the multi-atlas fusion process to determine the anatomical location of WMH. Areas identified using the MADL method agreed well with manual delineation, with an interclass correlation of 0.97 and similarity index (SI) between 0.55 and 0.72, depending on the total WMH load. Performance was compared to other state-of-the-art WMH detection methods, such as BIANCA and LST. MADL-based analyses of WMH in an older population revealed a significant association between age and WMH load in deep WM but not subcortical WM. The findings also suggested increased WMH load in selective brain regions in subjects with mild cognitive impairment compared to controls, including the inferior deep WM and occipital subcortical WM. The proposed MADL approach may facilitate location-dependent characterization of WMH in older individuals with memory impairment.",GABA and glutamate moderate beta-amyloid related functional connectivity in cognitively unimpaired old-aged adults.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927605,NeuroImage.

The as-prepared Zn0.5Cd0.5S@ZnS core-shell nanospheres play a vital role in formation of the Zn0.5Cd0.5S@Bi2S3 composite nanospheres. The Zn0.5Cd0.5S/Bi2S3 composites show both excellent photocatalysis and photothermal effect.

For this purpose, a yeast-derived carbon (YC) sphere was added as a charge carrier bridge to the 2D-2D Cu2WS4/g-C3N4 heterojunction through a facile hydrothermal method. The YC sphere, as a bridge for electrons, is not only advantageous in inhibiting rapid recombination by electrons, but also remarkably enhances the visible light absorption capacity. Moreover, the YC sphere can also increase the specific surface area and surface roughness, which can enhance the adsorption of pollutant molecules and provide abundant active sites for photocatalytic reactions. The g-C3N4/YC/Cu2WS4 heterojunction showed the best photocatalytic activity for reducing hexavalent chromium Cr(VI) and decomposing tetracycline (TC) under visible light. Meanwhile, the acute toxicity of Daphnia magna (D. magna) gradually decreases with the conversion of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) in solution.

However, the high-cost and low-efficiency differentiation of BMSCs into functional osteoblasts limits their clinical application. It is desirable to develop bioactive materials to integrate efficient differentiation and traceable properties in a biocompatible manner for MSC-based therapy. In this study, a new kind of bioactive carbon dot (CD) was facilely fabricated through a one-step hydrothermal method from adenosine and aspirin. These bioactive CDs were cytocompatible and biosafe with the capability of long-term fluorescent tracking of human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hBMSCs). Notably, the presence of bioactive CDs triggered and directed a series of events that followed the temporal pattern of osteogenic differentiation through the promotion of osteogenic transcription and enhancement of matrix mineralization. Moreover, cells with bioactive CDs exhibited more effective osteogenic differentiation behavior than cells treated with either adenosine or aspirin alone. Overall, these findings clearly showed that adenosine and aspirin-based CDs can direct osteogenic differentiation of hBMSCs in the absence of any external osteoinductive factors. The unique properties of bioactive CDs could provide insight into their potential for achieving efficient and safe MSC-based therapy.",Positive mental health as a predictor of recovery from mental illness.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927584,Journal of affective disorders,2019 05 02,High levels of positive mental health protect individuals from mental illness.

Part A, Molecular and biomolecular spectroscopy",2019 04 27,"Designing an exceptional probe to detect minute quantities of melamine is of huge importance for the safety and health of the human race. In this study, an aquamarine blue and rapid fluorescent sensor was devised by chemical reduction synthesis method for highly selective and sensitive detection of melamine in milk using polyethyleneimine protected silver nanoparticles (PEI-AgNPs). The optical properties of PEI-AgNPs were studied as a function of reactive material concentration, incubation time, temperature and pH. The formation of PEI-AgNPs was verified by using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and found that the PEI-AgNPs were spherical in shape with an average diameter of 15 nm. The prepared PEI-AgNPs were aquamarine blue luminescent under UV light and show a maximum emission at 470 nm, when excited at 348 nm. The fluorescence of the PEI-AgNPs can be effectively quenched by the addition of melamine due to its ability to interact with citric acid (CA) through hydrogen bonding and form silver-melamine complexes with Ag+ via coordination bonds, while the addition of other nitro compounds induced feeble quenching of PEI-AgNPs, suggesting the high selectivity of PEI-AgNPs. The present sensor system exhibits a good linear response to melamine ranging from 0.16 to 56 μM, and the limit of detection was found to be 132 nM (Sb/K = 3).

In this paper, the lowest excited triplet state (T1) of 4‑amino‑4'‑nitrobiphenyl (NH2-Bp-NO2) was recorded with nanosecond transient absorption spectroscopy in acidic acetonitrile and alcoholic solutions. By employing the Kamlet-Taft model to analyze the correlation between absorption maxima and alcohol solvent properties including polarity/polarizability, abilities of hydrogen bond donating and hydrogen bond accepting, hydrogen bond configuration in the ground state (S0) and T1 was resolved. The results suggest that the hydrogen bond between amino H and alcohol is dominant in S0, while in T1, hydrogen bonds between amino H and alcohol, between nitro O and alcohol have comparable contribution. By examination of the 1‑naphthol quench effect on T1, the hydrogen bond between nitro O and alcohol was confirmed present. Theoretical calculation results on the model of NH2-Bp-NO2-(MeOH)3 also indicate that hydrogen bonds between amino H and alcohol, between nitro O and alcohol are both much stronger in T1 than in S0. In acidic acetonitrile solution, in S0 of NH2-Bp-NO2 the amino group is protonated with pKa of 4.5, meanwhile in T1 the nitro group is much easier to be protonated than in S0.

Several absorption bands which were not observed at room temperature emerged as the sample was cooled down to 14.9 K. All the bands shifted to higher energies upon cooling. The bands which exhibited an anomalous behavior in the frequency shift have a rate of change in the range (4-5) × 10-3 cm-1 K-1-1 while bands which displayed an expected behavior have the rate of change in the range (1-3) × 10-2 cm-1 K-1-1.

Here, based on the structures and pharmacological properties of two types of TS inhibitors, through a molecular assembly principle of drugs design, we designed and synthesized a series of 30 novel uracil derivatives as TS inhibitors. The antiproliferative ability of these compounds was evaluated against four cancer cell lines (A549, OVCAR-3, SGC-7901, and HepG2) by the MTT assay. Most of them showed excellent activities against all the tested cell lines. Furthermore, hTS assay results showed that these compounds have the unique ability to inhibit hTS activity in vitro.

The results demonstrated that the Kd values rapidly decreased and then remained steady in the pH range of 2.0-8.0. However, selenite sorption was promoted when pH exceeded 8.0, which might be attributed to the coprecipitation between Ca2+ and SeO32-. Besides, the change trend of the Kd values as functions of various parameters was not affected by oxygen. The sorption kinetics and isotherms could be well fitted by the pseudo-second-order kinetic model and the Freundlich model for both aerobic and anaerobic conditions, and the calculated thermodynamic parameters (△G and △H) suggested that the selenite sorption process was a spontaneous and endothermic process. Additionally, the XPS results revealed that Se(IV) could be reduced to Se (0) only in anaerobic conditions and that the different amounts of Fe on the clay surface led to the discrepancy of the Se(IV) Kd values under aerobic and anaerobic conditions even in high-salt simulated groundwater. Overall, our findings in this study are significant in regards to the retardation of selenite on the host rock under high salinity conditions.",Mechanisms of radiocesium depuration in Sebastes cheni derived by simulation analysis of measured 137Cs concentrations off southern Fukushima 2014-2016.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927563,Journal of environmental radioactivity,2019 04 11,"The cesium depuration mechanisms were studied in Japanese rockfish Sebastes cheni off Fukushima, in which the radiocesium level remains higher than in other teleost. Samples were collected approximately 5 km south from the nuclear power plant during 2014-2016, and the 137Cs concentrations in fish, stomach content and prey species were measured. The stable cesium content in fish was also analyzed and compared with fish age which was determined by annual ring analysis in otoliths. The 137Cs concentrations in the dominant prey species, mysids and brown shrimp, were several Bq kg-w.w.-1; indicating that transfer via the food chain was substantial compared to that from seawater during the study period. The 137Cs concentrations in S. cheni decreased from 2014 to 2016 due to the metabolic excretion and the rate of decrease in its diet. Biokinetic model analyses confirmed the slower turnover of stable cesium in S. cheni, represented as a biological half-life (Tb1/2) of 140-215 d, and was associated with stable Cs levels in food of 5-7 ng g-w.w.-1. The 137Cs levels in S. cheni were also simulated, which showed that the 137Cs depuration in fish exposed to the initial contaminated plume in 2011 resulted from slower metabolic excretion, while the 137Cs levels in fish born after 2012 could be regarded as equilibrated with the environmental levels of 137Cs. Furthermore, the simulation results suggest that 137Cs depuration in S. cheni population was also caused by the alternation of generation, which can be substantial by the addition of new year class population hatched after 2012 that were not contaminated by the initial contaminated plume from the 2011 accident."

Here, we report that inducible PMLIV expression inhibits cell proliferation as well as self-renewal and impairs cell cycle progression of breast cancer cell lines in a reversible manner. Transcriptomic profiling identified a large number of PML-deregulated genes associated with various cell processes. Among them, cell cycle- and division-related genes and their cognitive regulators are highly ranked. In this study, we focused on previously unknown PML targets, namely the Forkhead transcription factors. PML suppresses the Forkhead box subclass M1 (FOXM1) transcription factor at both the RNA and protein levels, along with many of its gene targets. We show that FOXM1 interacts with PMLIV primarily via its DNA-binding domain and dynamically colocalizes in PML nuclear bodies. In parallel, PML modulates the activity of Forkhead box O3 (FOXO3), a factor opposing certain FOXM1 activities, to promote cell survival and stress resistance. Thus, PMLIV affects the balance of FOXO3 and FOXM1 transcriptional programs by acting on discrete gene subsets to favor both growth inhibition and survival. Interestingly, PMLIV-specific knockdown mimicked ectopic expression vis-à-vis loss of proliferative ability and self-renewal, but also led to loss of survival ability as shown by increased apoptosis. We propose that divergent or similar effects on cell physiology may be elicited by high or low PMLIV levels dictated by other concurrent genetic or epigenetic cancer cell states that may additionally account for its disparate effects in various cancer types.",Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) serum levels and risk of spontaneous abortion: A prospective population-based cohort study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927551,Clinical endocrinology,2019 06 13,"Thyroid dysfunction, a common complication of pregnancy, is associated with adverse obstetric and neonatal consequences.

Fibromatosis may simulate cancer recurrence on imaging surveillance for colorectal cancer follow-up. The optimal treatment of recurrent peritoneal malignancy is cytoreductive surgery (CRS) and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC). Confirmatory biopsy of lesions suspicious for colorectal cancer recurrence may not be feasible, thereby rendering surgery the safest option. Our aim was to determine the incidence of fibromatosis in a cohort of patients undergoing CRS and HIPEC for suspected colorectal cancer recurrence.",Reproductive fitness consequences of progenesis: Sex-specific pay-offs in safe and risky environments.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927549,Journal of evolutionary biology,2019 06 05,"Progenesis is considered to have an important role in evolution because it allows the retention of both a larval body size and shape in an adult morphology. However, the cost caused by the adoption of a progenetic process in both males and females remains to be explored to explain the success of progenesis and particularly its biased prevalence across the sexes and environments. Here, through an experimental approach, we used a facultative progenetic species, the palmate newt (Lissotriton helveticus) that can either mature at a small size and retain gills or mature after metamorphosis, to test three hypotheses for sex-specific pay-offs of progenesis in safe versus risky habitats. Goldfish were used because they caused a higher decline in progenetic than metamorphic newts. We determined that progenetic newts have a lower reproductive fitness than metamorphic newts. We also found that, when compared to metamorphs, progenetic males have lower reproductive activity than progenetic females and that predatory risk affects more progenetic than metamorphic newts. By identifying ultimate causes of the female-biased sex ratios found in nature, these results support the male escape hypothesis, that is the higher metamorphosis rate of progenetic males. They also highlight that although progenesis is advantageous in advancing the age at first reproduction, it also brings an immediate fitness cost and this, particularly, in hostile predatory environments. This means that whereas some environmental constraints could favour facultative progenesis, some others, such as predation, can ultimately counter-select progenesis. Altogether, these results improve our understanding of how developmental processes can affect the sexes differently and how species invasions can impair the success of alternative developmental phenotypes.",Integrated population models: powerful methods to embed individual processes in population dynamics models.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927548,Ecology,2019 06 03,"Population dynamics models have long assumed that populations are composed of a restricted number of groups, where individuals in each group have identical demographic rates and where all groups are similarly affected by density-dependent and -independent effects. However, individuals usually vary tremendously in performance and in their sensitivity to environmental conditions or resource limitation, such that individual contributions to population growth will be highly variable. Recent efforts to integrate individual processes in population models open up new opportunities for the study of eco-evolutionary processes, such as the density-dependent influence of environmental conditions on the evolution of morphological, behavioral, and life-history traits. We review recent advances that demonstrate how including individual mechanisms in models of population dynamics contributes to a better understanding of the drivers of population dynamics within the framework of integrated population models (IPMs). IPMs allow for the integration in a single inferential framework of different data types as well as variable population structure including sex, social group, or territory, all of which can be formulated to include individual-level processes. Through a series of examples, we first show how IPMs can be beneficial for getting more accurate estimates of demographic traits than classic matrix population models by including basic population structure and their influence on population dynamics. Second, the integration of individual- and population-level data allows estimating density-dependent effects along with their inherent uncertainty by directly using the population structure and size to feedback on demography. Third, we show how IPMs can be used to study the influence of the dynamics of continuous individual traits and individual quality on population dynamics. We conclude by discussing the benefits and limitations of IPMs for integrating data at different spatial, temporal, and organismal levels to build more mechanistic models of population dynamics.","Human Papillomavirus Antibody Levels and Quadrivalent Vaccine Clinical Effectiveness in Perinatally Human Immunodeficiency Virus-infected and Exposed, Uninfected Youth.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927547,Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America,2019 06 10,"Persons who are infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are at high risk of human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated cancers.

Although insecticides are registered to spray cotton fields against boll weevils, only a few offer satisfactory control and most have broad-spectrum action. Alternatively, spinosyns have been recommended against lepidopteran pest species in cotton and are considered comparatively of reduced risk to nontargets. The susceptibility of nine populations of boll weevil to spinosad and spinetoram was determined through dried residue on squares and cotton leaves. Furthermore, control efficacy of spinosad and spinetoram compared with the standard organophosphate malathion was determined for caged adults at two different positions within the plant canopy or treated cotton leaves after different spray intervals. Boll weevil susceptibility varied across the nine populations and tested spinosyns. The lethal concentrations (LC50s and LC90s) varied from 8.62 to 32.25 and 49.86 to 281.70 mg a.i./l for spinosad and from 2.17 to 15.36 and 8.58 to 69.36 mg a.i./l for spinetoram. The location of boll weevil within the plant canopy affected the insecticide efficacy with higher mortality when caged on upper parts rather than on lower parts of cotton plants (>85% vs <45% of control) across all three insecticides. In addition, dried residues of spinosyns resulted in adult mortality >80% until the end of the evaluation period (8 d), while the standard malathion caused only 10% at this last evaluation time. Thus, we can conclude that both spinosyns promoted prolonged adult mortality using recommended field rates compared with the standard malathion.","Spotted-Wing Drosophila (Diptera: Drosophilidae) Adult Movement, Activity, and Oviposition Behavior in Maine Wild Blueberry (Vaccinium angustifolium; Ericales: Ericaceae).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927545,Journal of economic entomology,2019 03 30,"Over a period of 5 yr (2012-2016), we conducted laboratory and field studies on activity, movement, and response to trap placement of adult Drosophila suzukii (Matsumura) in wild blueberry, Vaccinium angustifolium Aiton, fields in Maine. When measuring temporal patterns in fruit infestation, we found that D. suzukii females are most active in the morning and that they are 10 times more likely to lay eggs in blueberries at the top of the plant canopy compared with berries located in the lower part of the bush. Flies were found to be more abundant in fruit-bearing (crop) fields compared with pruned (vegetative) fields based on trap capture of adults. They are also most abundant along edges of fields compared with interiors. Trap efficiency is significantly better in traps 1.2 m above the ground and above the crop canopy of this low-growing crop plant than within the crop canopy. Three experiments involving the marking of laboratory-reared flies with fluorescent marker, their release, and capture with traps along a grid in fields suggest that: 1) fluorescent markers do not affect the distance moved of marked flies, 2) dispersal rates are not different between sexes, 3) there is little difference in the dispersal pattern through pruned fields and fruit-bearing fields, and 4) flies disperse at a low rate of 0.1-30 m per day, with an average of 5 m per day, but that long-distance dispersal over 1-2 km is feasible based on statistical model extrapolation.","Seasonal Occurrence of Haemaphysalis longicornis (Acari: Ixodidae) and Haemaphysalis flava, Vectors of Severe Fever With Thrombocytopenia Syndrome (SFTS) in South Korea.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927544,Journal of medical entomology,2019 03 30,"The seasonal abundance of Haemaphysalis longicornis Neumann and H. flava Neumann (Acari: Ixodidae) was monitored from 2015 through 2017 in Gyeonggi-do, South Korea.

Biokhimiia,2019 04 23,"Olivomycin A is a highly active antitumor drug that belongs to the family of aureolic acid antibiotics. The antitumor effect of olivomycin A is related to its ability to bind to the DNA minor groove in GC-rich regions as Mg2+-coordinated complexes. Characterization of cellular targets of olivomycin A and its mechanism of action is crucial for the successful application of this antibiotic in clinical practice and development of semi-synthetic derivatives with improved pharmacological properties. Previously, we have shown that minor groove ligands are able to disrupt the key epigenetic process of DNA methylation. In this paper, we have studied the impact of olivomycin A and its improved semi-synthetic analogue N,N-dimethylaminoethylamide of 1'-des-(2,3-dihydroxy-n-butyroyl)-1'-carboxy-olivomycin A (olivamide) on the functioning of de novo DNA methyltransferase Dnmt3a (enzyme that carries out methylation of cytosine residues in the DNA CG-sites in eukaryotic cells) using an in vitro system consisting of the murine Dnmt3a catalytic domain and a 30-mer DNA duplex containing four consecutive GC pairs. We have shown that olivomycin A and olivamide inhibit Dnmt3a with IC50 of 6 ± 1 and 7.1 ± 0.7 μM, respectively. Neither olivomycin A nor olivamide interfered with the formation of the specific enzyme-substrate complex; however, olivomycin A prevented formation of the covalent DNA-Dnmt3a intermediate that is necessary for the methylation reaction to proceed. The inhibitory effects of olivomycin A and olivamide can be explained by the disruption of the enzyme catalytic loop movement through the DNA minor groove (the reaction stage that precedes the covalent bond formation between DNA and the enzyme). The results of this work indicate the epigenetic contribution to the antitumor effect of aureolic acid group antibiotics.","Mitochondria in Obliquely Striated Muscles of the Horsehair Worm Gordionus alpestris (Nematomorpha, Gordioidea) with Structural Organization Typical of Cells with Energy-Intensive Processes.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927526,Biochemistry.

No fundamental differences were found in the ultrastructure of the muscle tissue mitochondria in actively moving free-living and parasitic G. alpestris worms. The functional significance of the observed ultrastructural organization of mitochondria is discussed in connection with the necessity for an extended mitochondrial membrane system for a uniform supply of active muscle tissue with energy.",Identification of Amyloidogenic Regions in the Spine of Insulin Fibrils.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927525,Biochemistry. Biokhimiia,2019 04 23,"To reveal conformational changes resulting in the formation of insulin fibrils, it is necessary to identify amyloidogenic regions in the structure of protein monomers. Different models of insulin fibrillogenesis have been proposed previously. However, precise regions responsible for the formation of amyloid fibrils have not been identified. Using bioinformatics programs for predicting amyloidogenic regions, we have determined some common amyloidogenic sequences in the structure of insulin monomers. The use of limited proteolysis and mass spectrometry analysis of the obtained protein fragments resistant to the action of proteases allowed us to identify amino acid sequences in the insulin structure that can form the spine of the insulin fibrils. The obtained results are in agreement with the earlier proposed model of fibril formation from the ring-like oligomers and can be used for designing insulin analogs resistant to amyloidogenesis.",Aim23p Interacts with the Yeast Mitochondrial Ribosomal Small Subunit.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927524,Biochemistry.

The commercial preparation Epostim (LLC Pharmapark, Russia) produced by synthesis in Chinese hamster ovary cells was used for comparison. The EPO variant with the C-terminal HBD domain connected by a rigid linker (EPO-HBD) possesses the best properties as compared to HBD-EPO with the reverse domain arrangement. It was ~13 times more active in vitro (i.e., promoted proliferation of human erythroleukemia TF-1 cells) and demonstrated a higher rate of association with the erythropoietin receptor. EPO-HBD also exhibited the greatest binding to the demineralized bone matrix (DBM) and more prolonged release from the DBM among the four proteins studied. Subcutaneous administration of EPO-HBD immobilized on DBM resulted in significantly more pronounced vascularization of surrounding tissues in comparison with the other proteins and DBM alone. Therefore, EPO-HBD displayed better performance with regard to all the investigated parameters than other examined EPO variants, and it seems promising to study the possibility of its medical use.",Western Blotting-Based Quantitative Measurement of Myosin II Regulatory Light Chain Phosphorylation in Small Amounts of Non-muscle Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927521,Biochemistry. Biokhimiia,2019 04 23,"Myosin II is the main molecular motor in the actomyosin-dependent motility in cells. Phosphorylation of the myosin regulatory light chain (RLC) at Ser19 is a prerequisite for smooth muscle/non-muscle myosin II activation and serves as a biochemical equivalent of myosin II activity. Simultaneous phosphorylation at Thr18 further promotes the myosin II ATPase activity. A number of methods have been developed to measure myosin RLC phosphorylation at Ser19 or di-phosphorylation at Thr18/Ser19. While these methods are straightforward and robust in myosin-rich muscle tissues, they demonstrate limited applicability in non-muscle cells that have low myosin II content and are usually available in lesser amounts than muscle tissue. Because of this, dynamic analysis of RLC phosphorylation in multiple samples of non-muscle cells is difficult and requires large number of cells. The use of phospho-specific antibodies increases detection sensitivity but allows estimation of only relative levels of RLC phosphorylation at specific residues, which makes it difficult to estimate the physiologic relevancy of the observed changes in RLC phosphorylation. To measure RLC phosphorylation in small amounts of non-muscle cells, we used external calibration standards of non-phosphorylated and in vitro phosphorylated RLC in standard SDS-PAGE and Western blot procedures with phospho-specific RLC antibodies. Here, we describe the method in detail and demonstrate its application for quantitative measurement of myosin RLC phosphorylation in endothelial cells in response to natural agonists (thrombin or insulin) and intact human platelets. We discuss the advantages and limitations of the proposed method vs other approaches for measuring myosin RLC phosphorylation in non-muscle cells.",Mechanisms of Leptin and Ghrelin Action on Maturation and Functions of Dendritic Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927520,Biochemistry.

The presence of leptin during DC maturation did not affect the levels of CD83+CD1c+, CD86+CD1c+, and HLA-DR+CD1c+ DCs, but increased the amount and the activity of the enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO). Cell culturing in the presence of ghrelin or combination of leptin and ghrelin reduced the percentage of CD86+CD1c+ DCs but did not affect the levels of CD83+CD1c+ and HLA-DR+CD1c+ DCs. In addition, ghrelin reduced the number of IDO molecules without affecting its activity. Simultaneous presence of leptin and ghrelin increased induced IDO activity without affecting the amount of the enzyme in DCs. The effects of leptin and ghrelin on the investigated functions of DCs in some cases correlated with high levels of cAMP.

However, some Lactobacillus species are sensitive to CRISPR-Cas9 induced double strand breaks (DSBs) due to a deficiency in homology-directed repair (HDR), which allows chromosomal genetic editing. Here, phage-derived RecE/T is coupled with CRISPR-Cas9 and the transcriptional activity of broad-spectrum host promoters is assessed to set up a versatile toolbox containing a recombination helper plasmid and a broad host CRISPR-Cas9 editing plasmid, which enables efficient genome editing in Lactobacillus plantarum (L. plantarum) WCFS1 and Lactobacillus brevis (L. brevis) ATCC367. The RecE/T-assisted CRISPR-Cas9 toolbox realizes single gene deletions at an efficiency of 50-100% in seven days. Furthermore, the chromosomal gene replacement of Lp_0537 using a P23 -pyruvate decarboxylase (pdc) expression cassette is accomplished with an efficiency of 35.7%. This study establises a RecE/T-assisted CRISPR genome editing toolbox for L. plantarum WCFS1 and L. brevis ATCC367 and also demonstrate that RecE/T-assisted CRISPR-Cas9 is an effective genome editing system, which can be readily implemented in Lactobacilli.","Biotechnology, Big Data and Artificial Intelligence.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927505,Biotechnology journal,2019 05 27,"Developments in biotechnology are increasingly dependent on the extensive use of big data, generated by modern high-throughput instrumentation technologies, and stored in thousands of databases, public and private.

A previous study suggested that miR-10a promotes glioma cell migration and invasion. However, the effect of miR-10a on the proliferation of glioma cells remains unknown.

Ectopic expression of MTMR3 neutralized the effect of miR-10a on glioma. Furthermore, miR-10a and MTMR3 regulated β-catenin expression and genes downstream of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, such as Bcl-2, c-myc, p-c-Jun, and cleaved caspase-3, to affect the proliferation ability and apoptosis of glioma cells. In conclusion, our results indicated that miR-10a regulated cell proliferation and apoptosis by directly targeting MTMR3 and could function as a prognostic factor for progression of glioma.","Bent Phosphaallenes With ""Hidden"" Lone Pairs as Ligands.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927503,"Chemistry (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)",2019 06 13,"Phosphaheteroallenes R-P=C=L, with L = N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs), can be viewed to a certain extent as phosphaisonitriles stabilized with NHCs, R-P=C:←L.

In the past, lncRNAs were considered as 'transcript noise' or 'pseudogenes' and were thus ignored. However, in recent years, lncRNAs have been proven to regulate gene expression at the epigenetic, transcriptional and translational level, and thereby influence cell proliferation, apoptosis, viability, immune response and oxidative stress. Furthermore, increasing evidence points to their involvement in different diseases, including cancer and heart diseases. Recently, lncRNAs were shown to be differentially expressed in ocular tissues and play a significant role in the pathogenesis of ophthalmological disorders such as glaucoma, corneal diseases, cataract, diabetic retinopathy, proliferative vitreoretinopathy and ocular tumors. In this review, we summarize the classification and mechanisms of known lncRNAs, while detailing their biological functions and roles in ocular diseases. Moreover, we provide a concise review of the clinical relevance of lncRNAs as novel, potential therapeutic targets in the treatment of eye diseases.",A multicenter randomized controlled trial using a novel collagen membrane for guided bone regeneration at dehisced single implant sites: Outcome at prosthetic delivery and at 1-year follow-up.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927498,Clinical oral implants research,2019 06 06,To compare clinical performance of a novel resorbable non-cross-linked collagen membrane (CXP) with a reference membrane (non-cross-linked resorbable membrane; BG) for simultaneous implant placement and guided bone regeneration (GBR) at dehisced single implant sites.,The Vascular Behavioral and Cognitive Disorders criteria for vascular cognitive disorders: a validation study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927497,European journal of neurology,2019 05 17,"The Vascular Behavioral and Cognitive Disorders (VASCOG) criteria for vascular cognitive disorders were published in 2014, but their concurrent and predictive validity have not been examined.",Synthetic Biology Toolkits for Metabolic Engineering of Cyanobacteria.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927496,Biotechnology journal,2019 05 20,"Cyanobacteria are of great importance to Earth's ecology.

Hence, cyanobacteria are fast becoming an emerging platform in synthetic biology and metabolic engineering. Herein, the progress made in the synthetic biology toolkits for cyanobacteria and their utilization for transforming cyanobacteria into microbial cell factories for sustainable production of biofuels and biochemicals is outlined. Current techniques in heterologous gene expression, strategies in genome editing, and development of programmable regulatory parts and modules for engineering cyanobacteria towards biochemical production are discussed and prospected.

These bacteria are the causative agent of brucellosis, one of the zoonotic infections with the highest incidence in the world and for which a human vaccine is still unavailable. Current therapeutic treatments against brucellosis are based on the combination of two or more antibiotics for prolonged periods, which may lead to antibiotic resistance in the population. Riboflavin (vitamin B2) is biosynthesized by microorganisms and plants but mammals, including humans, must obtain it from dietary sources. Owing to the absence of the riboflavin biosynthetic enzymes in animals, this pathway is nowadays regarded as a rich resource of targets for the development of new antimicrobial agents. In this work, we describe a high-throughput screening approach to identify inhibitors of the enzymatic activity of riboflavin synthase, the last enzyme in this pathway. We also provide evidence for their subsequent validation as potential drug candidates in an in vitro brucellosis infection model. From an initial set of 44 000 highly diverse low molecular weight compounds with drug-like properties, we were able to identify ten molecules with 50% inhibitory concentrations in the low micromolar range. Further Brucella culture and intramacrophagic replication experiments showed that the most effective bactericidal compounds share a 2-Phenylamidazo[2,1-b][1,3]benzothiazole chemical scaffold.

Here, the discovery and characterization of a novel suite of CRPs, collectively named potentides pA1- pA16 from the root of the medicinal herb Potentilla anserina L, are described. Using a combination of proteomic and transcriptomic methods, we showed that 35-residue potentide pA3, the most abundant member of potentides, exhibits high stability against heat, acidic and proteolytic degradation. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that potentide precursor sequences contain four tandem repeats for mature domain, which is the first report that the tandem repeats are found in the Rosaceae family. Disulfide mapping showed that potentide pA3 displays a novel disulfide connectivity of C1-C3, C2-C6 and C4-C5, a cystine motif that has not been reported in plant CRPs. Transcriptomic data mining and a neighbor-joining clustering analysis revealed 56 potentide homologs and their distribution in the families of Rosaceae and Ranunculaceae in angiosperm. Altogether, these results reveal a new plant CRP structure with an unusual cystine connectivity. Additionally, this study expands the families and structure diversity of CRPs as potentially active peptide pharmaceuticals.","Primary microcephaly, primordial dwarfism, and brachydactyly in adult cases with biallelic skipping of RTTN exon 42.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927481,Human mutation,2019 05 24,"Biallelic and pathogenic variants in the RTTN gene, encoding the centrosomal protein Rotatin, are associated with variable degrees of neurodevelopmental abnormalities, microcephaly, and extracranial malformations.

Avicennia schaueriana is abundant in mangrove sites and has been subject to Cd contamination. The possible effects of Cd toxicity and the structural and physiological disturbances to this plant were studied. Can this plant express early cellular tolerance mechanisms to such metal contamination? Seedlings of A. schaueriana were collected from sites of their natural occurrence, placed in plastic pots containing nutrient solution for 60 days, and subsequently exposed to increasing Cd concentrations for 5 days under experimental conditions. The anatomical, ultrastructural and physiological changes induced by Cd were analysed. Cd accumulated mainly in the root system and in pneumatophores, stems and leaves, induced differential accumulation of mineral nutrients, but did not induce necrosis or changes in leaf anatomy. However, there was a decrease in starch grains and an increase in deposited electron-dense material in the cortex and vascular bundles. Cd induced both increases in calcium (Ca) content in shoots and Ca oxalate crystal precipitation in leaf mesophyll and was detected in crystals and in the secretion of salt glands. Our observations and experimental results provide evidence of Cd tolerance in A. schaueriana. As a new feature, despite the clear cellular physiological disorders, this plant is able to eliminate Cd through leaf salt glands and immobilise it in Ca crystals, representing fast mechanisms for Cd exclusion and complexation in leaves in heavy metal coastal polluted marine ecosystems.",Clinical relevance of circulating MACC1 and S100A4 transcripts for ovarian cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927479,Molecular oncology,2019 05 07,"Metastasis-associated in colon cancer 1 (MACC1) and S100 calcium-binding protein A4 (S100A4) are prominent inducers of tumor progression and metastasis.

Previous research has aimed at linking these impairments with altered sleep architecture, but results were inconclusive. One plausible explanation is that only a few studies recorded markers of autonomic nervous system activity. For the first time, this study collected such markers under ecologically valid conditions with ambulatory assessment. In 19 individuals with frequent nightmares (≥1 nightmare/week) and 19 healthy control participants (<1 nightmare/month), measures indicating autonomic activation (heart rate, heart rate variability, respiration cycle length, electrodermal fluctuations, EEG arousals, saliva cortisol, REM density) were collected while applying ambulatory polysomnographic assessment during 3 consecutive nights. When nightmare participants reported a nightmare, we analyzed the last 5 min of REM sleep before awakening and compared these data to their non-nightmares as well as to the dream episodes of control participants. Overall, there were no general differences in autonomic activation of nightmare sufferers compared to control participants. However, when nightmare participants experienced nightmares, autonomic activation was markedly increased compared to their own non-nightmares and, to some extent, to control participant's dreams. Significant intraindividual differences were found for all autonomic measures except in participant's EEG arousals and cortisol levels. Group differences were found in EEG arousals and heart rate. In conclusion, ambulatory polysomnography demonstrates that nightmares are accompanied by increased autonomic activation. Results support the notion of impaired self-reported sleep quality caused by one's autonomic response rather than altered sleep pattern.",Perceptions of a large amount of food based on binge-eating disorder diagnosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927476,The International journal of eating disorders,2019 03 30,This study examined what adults with binge-eating disorder (BED) and obesity perceived as the threshold for a large amount of food and how their evaluations compared to ratings by participants with obesity but without BED.,Gathering data for decisions: best practice use of primary care electronic records for research.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927466,The Medical journal of Australia,2019 05 07,"In Australia, there is limited use of primary health care data for research and for data linkage between health care settings.

Examples include concerns about privacy protection, data security, data custodians and the motives for collecting data, as well as a lack of incentives for general practitioners to share data. Addressing barriers may help define good practices for appropriate use of health data for research. Any model for general practice data sharing for research should be underpinned by transparency and a strong legal, ethical, governance and data security framework.

However, it now becomes clear that it is not so simple, because the photosynthetic response to gaseous conditions involves 'ancillary' metabolisms, even in the short-term. That is, carbon and nitrogen utilization by pathways other than the Calvin cycle and the photorespiratory cycle, as well as rapid signaling events, can influence the observed rate of net photosynthesis.

Development of organoids with tissue architecture similar to testis in vivo has remained a challenge. Here, we present a microwell aggregation approach to establish multicellular 3D testicular organoids from pig, mouse, macaque, and human. The organoids consist of germ cells, Sertoli cells, Leydig cells, and peritubular myoid cells forming a distinct seminiferous epithelium and interstitial compartment separated by a basement membrane. Sertoli cells in the organoids express tight junction proteins claudin 11 and occludin. Germ cells in organoids showed an attenuated response to retinoic acid compared to germ cells in 2D culture indicating that the tissue architecture of the organoid modulates response to retinoic acid similar to in vivo. Germ cells maintaining physiological cell-cell interactions in organoids also had lower levels of autophagy indicating lower levels of cellular stress. When organoids were treated with mono(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP), levels of germ cell autophagy increased in a dose-dependent manner, indicating the utility of the organoids for toxicity screening. Ablation of primary cilia on testicular somatic cells inhibited the formation of organoids demonstrating an application to screen for factors affecting testicular morphogenesis.

Bacteriophages can be used to infect specific bacteria, which make them good candidates for detecting and editing bacterial populations. However, creating phage-based detection assays is somewhat limited by the difficulties in the engineering of phages. We present here a synthetic biology strategy to engineer phages using a simple in vitro method. We used this method to insert a NanoLuc luciferase expression cassette into the T7 phage, in order to construct the NRGp6 reporter phage. The synthetic NRGp6 phage was used to efficiently detect low concentrations of Escherichia coli from liquid culture. We envision that our approach will benefit synthetic biologists for constructing different kinds of engineered phages, and enable new approaches for phage-based therapeutics and diagnostics."

The Taylor Glacier, Antarctica, periodically expels iron-rich brine through a conduit sourced from a deep subglacial aquifer, creating a dramatic red surface feature known as Blood Falls. We used Illumina MiSeq sequencing to describe the core microbiome of this subglacial brine and identified previously undetected but abundant groups including the candidate bacterial phylum Atribacteria and archaeal phylum Pacearchaeota. Our work represents the first microbial characterization of samples collected from within a glacier using a melt probe, and the only Antarctic subglacial aquatic environment that, to date, has been sampled twice. A comparative analysis showed the brine community to be stable at the operational taxonomic unit level of 99% identity over a decade. Higher resolution sequencing enabled deconvolution of the microbiome of subglacial brine from mixtures of materials collected at the glacier surface. Diversity patterns between this brine and samples from the surrounding landscape provide insight into the hydrological connectivity of subglacial fluids to the surface polar desert environment. Understanding subice brines collected on the surfaces of thick ice covers has implications for analyses of expelled materials that may be sampled on icy extraterrestrial worlds.",The influence of acute hyperglycaemia on brachial artery flow-mediated dilatation in the early and late follicular phases of the menstrual cycle.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927376,Experimental physiology,2019 05 31,"What is the central question of the study?

We conducted a case-cohort study with 10,536 subcohort subjects and 3,541 newly diagnosed cancer cases derived from 32,949 eligible participants aged 40-69 years within the Japan Public Health Center-based Prospective Study. With 29 known type 2 diabetes susceptibility variants, we used an inverse variance-weighted method to estimate hazard ratios for the associations of diabetes with risks of total and site-specific cancers. The hazard ratios of cancer per doubling of the probability of diabetes were 1.03 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.92-1.15) overall, 1.08 (95% CI: 0.73-1.59) for the pancreas, 0.80 (95% CI: 0.57-1.14) for the liver and 0.90 (95% CI: 0.74-1.10) for the colorectum. Additional analyses, using publicly available large-scale genome-wide association study data on colorectal cancer in Japan, resulted in a narrower CI (hazard ratio: 1.00; 95% CI: 0.93-1.07).

The results indicated that, among adolescents with low teacher trust, discipline was unrelated to next-day behavior. Contrastingly, adolescents with high teacher but low institutional trust became less engaged following discipline, whereas those with high teacher and institutional trust became more engaged.

This study describes (a) the development of a self-report scale that captures the purported behavioral and experiential facets of engagement and (b) the evaluation of its validity in a real-world setting. A deductive approach to item generation was taken. The sample consisted of adults in the UK who drink excessively, downloaded the freely available Drink Less app with the intention to reduce alcohol consumption, and completed the scale immediately after their first login. Five types of validity (i.e., construct, criterion, predictive, incremental, divergent) were examined using exploratory factor analysis, correlational analyses, and through regressing the number of subsequent logins in the next 14 days onto total scale scores. Cronbach's α was calculated to assess internal reliability. A 10-item scale assessing amount and depth of use, interest, enjoyment, and attention was generated. Of 5,460 eligible users, only 203 (3.7%) users completed the scale. Seven items were retained, and the scale was found to be unifactorial and internally reliable (α = 0.77).

Although hydrolysis of conjugated species is sometimes required prior to analysis, desomorphine-glucuronide has not been fully investigated. In this study, six hydrolysis procedures were optimized and evaluated. Deconjugation efficiencies using chemical and enzymatic hydrolysis were evaluated and stability in aqueous solution was assessed. Acid hydrolysis was compared with five β-glucuronidase sources (BGTurbo™, IMCSzyme™, Escherichia coli, Helix pomatia and Patella vulgata). At optimal conditions, each hydrolysis method produced complete hydrolysis (≥96%). However, under simulated challenging conditions, P. vulgata was the most efficient β-glucuronidase for the hydrolysis of desomorphine-glucuronide. Both BGTurbo™ and IMCSzyme™ offered fast hydrolysis with no need for sample cleanup prior to liquid chromatography-quadrupole/time of flight-mass spectrometry (LC-Q/TOF-MS) analysis. Hydrolysates using E. coli, H. pomatia and P. vulgata underwent additional sample treatment using β-Gone™ cartridges.

We included 3,512 participants of the ARIC Study who attended Visit 5 (2011-2013) and were free of CVD (coronary heart disease, heart failure, or stroke). We used multivariable logistic regression to evaluate the cross-sectional associations of survivorship from any, non-sex-related, and sex-related cancers (e.g., breast, prostate) with elevated hs-cTnT (≥14 ng/L). Of 3,512 participants (mean age 76; 62% women; 21% black), 19% were cancer survivors. Cancer survivors had significantly higher odds of elevated hs-cTnT (OR 1.26, 95% CI 1.03, 1.53). Results were similar for survivors of non-sex-related and colorectal cancers. There was no association between survivorship from breast and prostate cancers and elevated hs-cTnT. Results were similar after additional adjustments for CVD risk factors. Survivors of some cancers may be more likely to have elevated hs-cTnT than persons without prior cancer. The excess burden of subclinical myocardial damage in this population may not be fully explained by traditional CVD risk factors.",From Epidemiological Knowledge to Improved Health: A Vision for Translational Epidemiology.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927354,American journal of epidemiology,2019 03 30,"Epidemiology should aim to improve population health; however, no consensus exists regarding the activities and skills that should be prioritized to achieve this goal.

We identified five themes in the translational epidemiology literature: foundations of epidemiological thinking, evidence-based public health or medicine, epidemiological education, implementation science, and community-engaged research (including literature on community-based participatory research). We then identified five priority areas for advancing translational epidemiology: (1) scientific engagement with public health; (2) public health communication; (3) epidemiological education; (4) epidemiology and implementation; and (5) community involvement. Using these priority areas as a starting point, we developed a conceptual framework of translational epidemiology that emphasizes interconnectedness and feedback between epidemiology, foundational science, and public health stakeholders. We also identified two to five representative principles in each priority area that could serve as the basis for advancing a vision of translational epidemiology. We believe that an emphasis on translational epidemiology can help the broader field to increase the efficiency of translating epidemiological knowledge into improved health outcomes and to achieve its goal of improving population health.",Concussion History and Career Status Influence Performance on Baseline Assessments in Elite Football Players.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927353,Archives of clinical neuropsychology : the official journal of the National Academy of Neuropsychologists,2019 03 30,To determine if concussion history and career status is associated with neurocognitive performance in elite football players.,The Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network: risk reduction and management of delirium.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927352,Age and ageing,2019 03 30,"Clinical and research interest in delirium has been rising over the last 15 years.

The 4AT has the advantage of being brief, embeds and operationalises cognitive testing, and is scalable with little training. The guidelines highlight the importance of non-pharmacological management for all hospital presentations involving the spectrum of cognitive disorders (delirium, dementia but at risk of delirium, delirium superimposed on dementia). Pharmacotherapy has a minimal role, but specific indications (e.g. intractable distress) are discussed. Advances in delirium research, education and policy, have come together with steady changes in the sociocultural context in which healthcare systems look after older people with cognitive impairment.

We use high-resolution scans from diffusion spectrum imaging and high angular resolution diffusion imaging to investigate the evolution of cortical pathways within the euarchontoglire (i.e., primates, rodents) lineage. More specifically, we compare cortical fiber pathways between macaques (Macaca mulatta), marmosets (Callithrix jachus), and rodents (mice, Mus musculus). We integrate these observations with comparative analyses of Neurofilament heavy polypeptide (NEFH) expression across the cortex of mice and primates. We chose these species because their phylogenetic position serves to trace the early evolutionary history of the human brain. Our comparative analysis from diffusion MR tractography, cortical white matter scaling, and NEFH expression demonstrates that the examined primates deviate from mice in possessing increased long-range cross-cortical projections, many of which course across the anterior to posterior axis of the cortex. Our study shows that integrating gene expression data with diffusion MR data is an effective approach in identifying variation in connectivity patterns between species. The expansion of corticocortical pathways and increased anterior to posterior cortical integration can be traced back to an extension of neurogenetic schedules during development in primates.",Percutaneous Transforaminal Endoscopic Discectomy versus Micro-Endoscopic Discectomy for Lumbar Disc Herniation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927349,Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research,2019 04 18,"BACKGROUND Percutaneous transforaminal endoscopic discectomy (PTED) and micro-endoscopic discectomy (MED) are alternative minimally invasive, widely performed procedures for the treatment of lumbar disc herniation (LDH).

The results indicated that PTED needs a shorter incision [-1.02 (-1.21 to -0.83), p<0.001], less time in bed [-2.14 (-3.34 to -0.94), p<0.001], and shorter hospital stay [-1.92 (-2.90 to -0.94), p<0.001], whereas MED is superior regarding intraoperative fluoroscopy [7.47 (2.78 to 12.17), p=0.002] and total cost [0.69 (0.38 to 1.00), p<0.001]. No significant differences were found on operation time, intraoperative blood loss, or complications. Significant lower back pain was found in the PTED group at 1 week postoperatively [-0.52 (-0.95 to -0.10), p=0.02] and 1 year postoperatively or the last follow-up [-0.41 (-0.76 to -0.06), p=0.02]; significant lower leg pain was also detected at 1 week postoperatively [-0.52 (-0.75 to -0.30), p<0.001]. Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) was significant better at 1 week postoperatively in the PTED group [-4.41 (-7.03 to -1.79), p=0.001]. No significant differences were detected at other time points regarding pain score and ODI. CONCLUSIONS Both PTED and MED are safe and effective techniques for treating LDH. However, taking all clinical outcomes together, PTED might be a preferable treatment modality for LDH.","Bordetella Filamentous Hemagglutinin, a Model for the Two-Partner Secretion Pathway.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927348,Microbiology spectrum,2019 06 10,"Bacteria use a variety of mechanisms to translocate proteins from the cytoplasm, where they are synthesized, to the cell surface or extracellular environment or directly into other cells, where they perform their ultimate functions. Type V secretion systems (T5SS) use β-barrel transporter domains to export passenger domains across the outer membranes of Gram-negative bacteria. Distinct among T5SS are type Vb or two-partner secretion (TPS) systems in which the transporter and passenger are separate proteins, necessitating a mechanism for passenger-translocator recognition in the periplasm and providing the potential for reuse of the translocator. This review describes current knowledge of the TPS translocation mechanism, using Bordetella filamentous hemagglutinin (FHA) and its transporter FhaC as a model. We present the hypothesis that the TPS pathway may be a general mechanism for contact-dependent delivery of toxins to target cells."

Long noncoding RNAs and microRNAs (miRNAs) serve as noninvasive biomarkers for CRC surveillance and introduce new therapeutic approaches. LINC00657 and miR-106a expression levels play a pivotal role in CRC. This study included 190 Egyptian subjects, and the expression levels of LINC00657 and miR-106a in serum were measured by using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. We found that upregulation of LINC00657 and downregulation of miR-106a are significantly associated with the development of CRC. Also, a positive correlation was detected between their serum levels. In addition, serum LINC00657 can distinguish adenomatous polyposis (AP) patients and/or ulcerative colitis (UC) patients from controls. Also the miRNA-106a expression level discriminates AP but not UC from healthy individuals. Our study cited new diagnostic biomarkers for CRC, AP, and UC among Egyptians in addition to be noninvasive screening tools for CRC in both healthy subjects and those having precancerous lesions. © 2019 IUBMB Life, 1-2, 2019.",Mechanistic insights into Nav1.7-dependent regulation of rat prostate cancer cell invasiveness revealed by toxin probes and proteomic analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927332,The FEBS journal,2019 04 05,"Voltage-gated sodium channels are involved in tumor metastasis, as potentiating or attenuating their activities affects the migration and invasion process of tumor cells. In the present study, we tested the effect of two peptide toxins, JZTX-I and HNTX-III which function as Nav1.7 activator and inhibitor, respectively, on the migration and invasion ability of prostate cancer (PCa) cell line Mat-LyLu. These two peptides showed opposite effects, and subsequently a comparative proteomic analysis characterized 64 differentially expressed membrane proteins from the JZTX-I- and HNTX-III-treated groups. Among these, 15 proteins were down-regulated and 49 proteins were up-regulated in the HNTX-III group. Bioinformatic analysis showed eight proteins are cytoskeleton proteins or related regulators, which might play important roles in the metastasis of Mat-LyLu cells. The altered expressions of four of these proteins, fascin, muskelin, annexin A2, and cofilin-1, were validated by western blot analysis. Further function network analysis of these proteins revealed that the Rho family GTPases RhoA and Rac1 might be of particular importance for the rat PCa cell invasion. Pharmacological data revealed that JZTX-I and HNTX-III could modulate the Rho signaling pathway in a Nav1.7-dependent manner. In summary, this study suggests that the Nav1.7-dependent regulation of Rho GTPase activity plays a vital role in Mat-LyLu cell migration and invasion and provides new insights into the treatment of PCa.",Proceedings of the Inaugural Strategy Meeting for the Establishment of a Southeast Asia Regional Therapeutic Plasma Exchange Consortium for Neurological Disorders.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927331,"Therapeutic apheresis and dialysis : official peer-reviewed journal of the International Society for Apheresis, the Japanese Society for Apheresis, the Japanese Society for Dialysis Therapy",2019 05 22,"In conjunction with the third regional Southeast Asian (SEA) therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) conference in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, 25 clinicians and researchers from SEA and South Asian countries attended the inaugural strategy meeting for the establishment of a regional TPE consortium for neurological disorders. The primary objective was to establish regional collaboration to improve delivery of TPE services in SEA. A pre-meeting survey was conducted to gather insights on disease spectrum, contextual practice challenges, and the need for a regional TPE consensus. Challenges identified include limited healthcare funding in support of diagnostic workup, TPE therapy, as well as development of clinical infrastructure and expertise capacity building. There was favorable interest in developing a working plan contextualized to this region. Strategies to overcome challenges were discussed. This included the need for a comprehensive referral system and network of regional TPE centers suited to local needs, supported by innovative TPE delivery programs.",Long non-coding RNA ES1 controls the proliferation of breast cancer cells by regulating the Oct4/Sox2/miR-302 axis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927330,The FEBS journal,2019 04 26,"ES1 is a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) that regulates pluripotency of human embryonic stem cells, which is known to be a downstream target of stemness factors Oct4 and Nanog, and serves as a modular scaffold for Sox2. However, the role of ES1 in cancer biology is not fully characterized. The results of our study show that ES1 transcript is upregulated in both high-grade and P53-mutated breast tumor tissues. Knockdown experiments show that ES1 suppression in breast cancer cells restricts cancer cell proliferation and cell cycle progression. Moreover, ES1 inhibition can also induce apoptosis and cellular senescence. Additionally, our data reveal that ES1 transcript promotes cell migration as well as the epithelial to mesenchymal transition of breast cancer cells. Furthermore, loss of ES1 expression downregulates the expression of Oct4/Sox2 and consequently leads to downregulation of their targets, miR-302 and miR-106b. Altogether, for the first time, our findings reveal that ES1 controls the proliferation and death of breast cancer cells by regulating the Oct4/Sox2/miR-302/miR-106b axis.","Analysis of population-based colorectal cancer screening in Guangzhou, 2011-2015.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927329,Cancer medicine,2019 06 10,To analyze the detection rates of colorectal cancer (CRC) and polyps by population-based screening in Guangzhou.,Zinc finger domain of the human DTX protein adopts a unique RING fold.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927328,Protein science : a publication of the Protein Society,2019 05 21,"The Deltex (DTX) family is involved in ubiquitination and acts as Notch signaling modifiers for controlling cell fate determination. DTX promotes the development of the ubiquitin chain via its RING finger (DTX_RING). In this study, the solution structure of DTX_RING was determined using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Moreover, by experiments with a metallochromic indicator, we spectrophotometrically estimated the stoichiometry of zinc ions and found that DTX_RING possesses zinc-binding capabilities. The Simple Modular Architecture Research Tool database predicted the structure of DTX_RING as a typical RING finger. However, the actual DTX_RING structure adopts a novel RING fold with a unique topology distinct from other RING fingers. We unveiled the position and the range of the DTX_RING active site at the atomic level. Artificial RING fingers (ARFs) are made by grafting active sites of the RING fingers onto cross-brace structure motifs. Therefore, the present structural analysis could be useful for designing a novel ARF.",Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 α deletion in myeloid lineage attenuates hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927327,Physiological reports,2019 04 12,"Hypoxemia is seen in patients with pulmonary hypertension and hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction worsens their clinical condition. However, vasoconstriction is not the only aspect through which hypoxia induces the progression to pulmonary hypertension. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) is a transcription factor responding to hypoxic conditions by regulating hundreds of genes involved in angiogenesis, erythropoiesis, inflammation, and proliferation. We sought to determine the contribution of HIF-1α in myeloid lineage cells to the pulmonary vascular response to chronic exposure to hypoxia. We generated myeloid-specific HIF-1α knockout (MyeHIF1KO) mice by using Cre-lox P system, and exposed them to hypoxic conditions for 3 weeks to induce pulmonary hypertension. Macrophages from MyeHIF1KO and control mice were used for western blotting, RT-qPCR, chemotaxis assay, and ATP assay. MyeHIF1KO mice exposed to hypoxia for 3 weeks exhibited a significant reduction in the right ventricular systolic pressure accompanied by a decrease in the ratio of the right ventricular weight to left ventricular weight, muscularization of the small pulmonary arteries, and infiltration of macrophages into the lung and right ventricle compared with control mice. HIF-1α-deficient peritoneal macrophages showed less migration toward monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and a decrease in intracellular ATP levels. These results indicate that HIF-1α in macrophages contributes to the progression of pulmonary vascular remodeling and pulmonary hypertension induced by chronic exposure to hypoxic conditions. The inhibition of myeloid-specific HIF-1α may be a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension.",Human pantothenate kinase 4 is a pseudo-pantothenate kinase.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927326,Protein science : a publication of the Protein Society,2019 05 21,"Pantothenate kinase generates 4'-phosphopantothenate in the first and rate-determining step of coenzyme A (CoA) biosynthesis. The human genome encodes three well-characterized and nearly identical pantothenate kinases (PANK1-3) plus a putative bifunctional protein (PANK4) with a predicted amino-terminal pantothenate kinase domain fused to a carboxy-terminal phosphatase domain. Structural and phylogenetic analyses show that all active, characterized PANKs contain the key catalytic residues Glu138 and Arg207 (HsPANK3 numbering). However, all amniote PANK4s, including human PANK4, encode Glu138Val and Arg207Trp substitutions which are predicted to inactivate kinase activity. Biochemical analysis corroborates bioinformatic predictions-human PANK4 lacks pantothenate kinase activity. Introducing Glu138Val and Arg207Trp substitutions to the human PANK3 and plant PANK4 abolished their robust pantothenate kinase activity. Introducing both catalytic residues back into human PANK4 restored kinase activity, but only to a low level. This result suggests that epistatic changes to the rest of the protein already reduced the kinase activity prior to mutation of the catalytic residues in the course of evolution. The PANK4 from frog, an anamniote living relative encoding the catalytically active residues, had only a low level of kinase activity, supporting the view that HsPANK4 had reduced kinase activity prior to the catalytic residue substitutions in amniotes. Together, our data show that human PANK4 is a pseudo-pantothenate kinase-a catalytically deficient variant of the catalytically active PANK4 found in plants and fungi. The Glu138Val and Arg207Trp substitutions in amniotes (HsPANK3 numbering) completely deactivated the pantothenate kinase activity that had already been reduced by prior epistatic mutations."

Herein, we employ our previously developed HiTES methodology to identify one such compound against the ESKAPE pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Rather than induce silent biosynthetic gene clusters, we used HiTES to suppress actively-expressed virulence genes. By screening a library of 770 FDA-approved drugs, we identified guanfacine, a clinical hypertension drug, as an anti-virulence agent in P. aeruginosa. Follow-up studies showed that guanfacine reduces biofilm formation and pyocycanin production without affecting growth. Moreover, we identified a homolog of QseC, a sensor His kinase used by multiple pathogens to turn on virulence, as a target of guanfacine. Our studies suggest that guanfacine may be an attractive anti-virulence lead in P. aeruginosa and provide a template for identifying such molecules by screening for down-regulators of actively expressed biosynthetic genes.",Ultrasongraphic age-related changes of the pelvic floor muscles in nulliparous women and their association with pelvic floor symptoms: A pilot study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927314,Neurourology and urodynamics,2019 05 10,"To assess age-related changes in the pelvic floor muscular hiatus and their association with symptoms of pelvic organ prolapse, urinary and fecal incontinence, and sexual function.",Relaxation-compensated APT and rNOE CEST-MRI of human brain tumors at 3 T.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927313,Magnetic resonance in medicine,2019 05 10,"Relaxation-compensated CEST-MRI (i.e., the inverse metrics magnetization transfer ratio and apparent exchange-dependent relaxation) has already been shown to provide valuable information for brain tumor diagnosis at ultrahigh magnetic field strengths.

Here, we conducted a retrospective study to assess 375 patients whose initial biopsy indicated a TKI-sensitizing mutation (either EGFR 19del or L858R) and who developed PD after treatment with first-generation TKIs, and assayed for T790M status. We adopted a combination approach in which tissue rebiopsy is preferred, utilizing liquid biopsies when tissue rebiopsy is not feasible. We analyzed the potential predictive clinical factors affecting T790M detection, evaluated the standard rebiopsy and liquid biopsy methods in T790M genotyping, and reported the clinical performance of osimertinib. Our results suggested that primary EGFR 19del, brain metastasis, and longer progression-free survival of initial EGFR-TKI treatment are associated with acquired T790M resistance. T790M-positive patients significantly benefited from osimertinib. In conclusion, the real-world clinical adoption of the combination approach with both tissue rebiopsy and liquid biopsy for T790M genotyping may provide significant benefits to patients who have developed PD after first-generation TKI treatments."

In the present study, we have examined in vitro antiproliferative activity against human colon cancer cell lines HCT-116 of three series of 3-(4-substituted benzyl)-hydantoins with various substituent attached in position 5 of the hydantoin ring. Since the investigated compounds have recently been synthesized and show antiproliferative activity, a good understanding of the properties of the potential drug responsible for their pharmacokinetics is an important goal for their further development. One of the important properties is lipophilicity. Lipophilicity has been assessed by reversed-phase liquid chromatography (high-performance thin-layer chromatography and high-pressure liquid chromatography) by means of direct and indirect (using calibration curve) methods. Chromatographic lipophilicity indices in addition to calculated logP values were compared by hierarchical cluster analysis. The linear solvation energy relationship approach was used to understand and compare the types and relative strength of the molecular interactions that occur in the chromatographic as well as in the n-octanol-water partitioning systems. Finally, correlation between in silico pharmacokinetic predictors and antiproliferative activity was examined. Preliminary quantitative structure-activity relationship modeling indicates that pharmacokinetic predictors capture only one-quarter of all chemical features that are important for antiproliferative activity itself. Among selected descriptors are chromatographic lipophilicity indices.","Calcineurin-dependent dephosphorylation of the transcription factor CrzA at specific sites controls conidiation, stress tolerance, and virulence of Aspergillus fumigatus.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927289,Molecular microbiology,2019 06 10,"Calcium signaling through calcineurin and its major transcription factor (TF), CrzA, is integral to hyphal growth, stress response and virulence of the pathogenic fungus Aspergillus fumigatus, the leading etiology of invasive aspergillosis.

Mass spectroscopic analysis identified 20 phosphorylation sites, the majority of which were specific to filamentous fungi and distributed throughout the CrzA protein, with particular concentration in a serine-rich region N-terminal to the conserved DNA-binding domain (DBD). Site-directed mutagenesis of phosphorylated residues revealed that CrzA activity during calcium stimulation can only be suppressed by a high degree of phosphorylation in multiple regions of the protein. Our findings further suggest that this regulation is not solely accomplished through control of CrzA nuclear import. Additionally, we demonstrate the importance of the CrzA phosphorylation state in regulating growth, conidiation, calcium and cell wall stress tolerance, and virulence. Finally, we identify two previously undescribed nuclear localization sequences in the DBD.

We determined that the developmental regulator MtrA represses nitrogen-assimilation genes in nitrogen-rich media and that it competes with GlnR for binding to GlnR boxes. The GlnR boxes upstream of multiple nitrogen genes, such as amtB, were confirmed as MtrA binding sites in vitro by electrophoretic mobility shift assays and in vivo by ChIP-qPCR analysis. Transcriptional analysis indicated that, on nutrient-rich medium, MtrA profoundly repressed expression of nitrogen-associated genes, indicating opposing roles for MtrA and GlnR in the control of nitrogen metabolism. Using in vitro and in vivo analysis, we also showed that glnR is itself a direct target of MtrA and that MtrA represses glnR transcription. We further demonstrated functional conservation of MtrA homologues in the recognition of GlnR boxes upstream of nitrogen genes from different actinobacterial species. As mtrA and glnR are widespread among actinomycetes, this mechanism of potential competitive control over nitrogen metabolism genes may be common in this group, adding a major new layer of complexity to the known regulatory network for nitrogen metabolism in Streptomyces and related species.",Exogenous hydrogen sulphide supplement accelerates skin wound healing via oxidative stress inhibition and vascular endothelial growth factor enhancement.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927279,Experimental dermatology,2019 05 15,"Hydrogen sulphide (H2 S) is an important gasotransmitter with several physiological functions. However, the roles and the detailed mechanisms of H2 S on skin wound healing are not known well. In the present study, 129S1/SvImJ mice were intraperitoneally injected with NaHS (50 μmol/kg/d) for 2 weeks. Then, a round wound of 6 mm diameter with depth into the dermis was made. The skin wound area, blood perfusion, superoxide production, malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1) and optic atrophy 1 (OPA1) were measured. After NaHS (50 μmol/L) pre-administration for 4 hours, cell migration rate, DRP1, OPA1 and α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) expression, superoxide production and mitochondrial membrane potential in primary skin fibroblasts were measured. Tube formation in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and cell migration in human keratinocytes were also measured. The results showed that NaHS pretreatment significantly accelerated wound healing and improved blood flow in the wound after operation. NaHS increased VEGF expression in the wound and promoted tube formation in HUVECs. Meanwhile, NaHS attenuated reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, suppressed MDA level but restored T-AOC in the wound. NaHS also promoted skin fibroblasts migration and α-SMA expression after scratch. Moreover, NaHS alleviated ROS, increased mitochondrial membrane potential, decreased DRP1 but enhanced OPA1 expression in skin fibroblasts after scratch. NaHS also accelerated human keratinocytes migration after scratch. Taken together, exogenous H2 S supplementary accelerated the skin wound healing, which might be related to oxidative stress inhibition and VEGF enhancement.",Pathway genes and metabolites in thiopurine therapy in Korean children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927276,British journal of clinical pharmacology,2019 05 28,We aimed to investigate the impact of various genetic polymorphisms affecting thiopurine metabolism pathways and toxicity in paediatric acute lymphoblastic leukaemia patients for the first time in Korea.

Recently, it has been reported increased levels of tissue iron increase the risk of atherosclerosis. However, the detailed mechanism of iron-induced atherosclerosis progression is barely known. Here, we used apoE-deficient mice models to investigate the effects of low iron diet (<0 mg iron carbonyl/kg), high iron diet (25,000 mg iron carbonyl/kg) on atherosclerosis in vivo. As exhibited, we observed that CD68 was significant enriched by high iron diet in apoE-deficient mice. In addition, transforming growth factor β, tumor necrosis factor α, interleukin 6 (IL-6), IL-23, IL-10, and IL-1β levels were also greatly induced by high iron diet. Then, we found that the iron load promoted the inflammation response in macrophages. Moreover, macrophage polarization is a process by which macrophage can express various functional programs in activating macrophages. Here, we observed that iron-load macrophages were polarized toward a proinflammatory macrophage phenotype. The polarization of M1 macrophage was promoted by ferric ammonium citrate (FAC) in bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDMs). Furthermore, ECAR and cellular OCR in BMDM with or without FAC was examined. As shown, BMDM indicated with 50 μM FAC showed a significant increase in basic state and maximal ECAR in contrast to the control group. However, there was no significant difference in OCR. This indicated that the glycolysis was involved in the polarization of M1 macrophage triggered by iron-load. In conclusion, we indicated that the iron load exacerbates the progression of atherosclerosis via inducing inflammation and enhancing glycolysis in macrophages.","Opportunistic testing of BRCA1, BRCA2 and mismatch repair genes improves the yield of phenotype driven hereditary cancer gene panels.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927264,International journal of cancer,2019 05 15,"Multigene panels provide a powerful tool for analyzing several genes simultaneously. We evaluated the frequency of pathogenic variants (PV) in customized predefined panels according to clinical suspicion by phenotype and compared it to the yield obtained in the analysis of our clinical research gene panel. We also investigated mutational yield of opportunistic testing of BRCA1/2 and mismatch repair (MMR) genes in all patients. A total of 1,205 unrelated probands with clinical suspicion of hereditary cancer were screened for germline mutations using panel testing. Overall, 1,048 females and 157 males were analyzed, mean age at cancer diagnosis was 48; 883 had hereditary breast/ovarian cancer-suspicion, 205 hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC)-suspicion, 73 adenomatous-polyposis-suspicion and 44 with other/multiple clinical criteria. At least one PV was found in 150 probands (12%) analyzed by our customized phenotype-driven panel. Tumoral MMR deficiency predicted for the presence of germline MMR gene mutations in patients with HNPCC-suspicion (46/136 vs. 0/56 in patients with and without MMR deficiency, respectively). Opportunistic testing additionally identified five MSH6, one BRCA1 and one BRCA2 carriers (0.6%). The analysis of the extended 24-gene panel provided 25 additional PVs (2%), including in 4 out of 51 individuals harboring MMR-proficient colorectal tumors (2 CHEK2 and 2 ATM). Phenotype-based panels provide a notable rate of PVs with clinical actionability. Opportunistic testing of MMR and BRCA genes leads to a significant straightforward identification of MSH6, BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers, and endorses the model of opportunistic testing of genes with clinical utility within a standard genetic counseling framework.",The role of visuo-spatial abilities in environment learning from maps and navigation over the adult lifespan.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927263,"British journal of psychology (London, England : 1953)",2019 03 30,"Visuo-spatial abilities have an important role in environment learning. The aim of the present study was to explore whether these abilities relate to spatial recall after learning an environment from a map or a video, and irrespective of the learner's age (from youth to old age). The study involved 431 participants from 25 to 84 years old, who were assessed for their visuo-spatial working memory, object-based mental rotation, and perspective-taking abilities. Then, they learned environments from a map and a video, and performed pointing, map drawing, and route repetition tasks after learning from each type of input. The resulting path models showed that age related to visuo-spatial abilities and (in some cases) to spatial accuracy, too. After accounting for age, visuo-spatial abilities also related to spatial recall performance, whatever the type of learning input, especially in pointing tasks and, to a lesser degree, in map drawing and route repetition tasks. Overall, the relationship between individual visuo-spatial abilities and environment learning relates to the learning input and the type of task used to assess recall. This relationship was found in a large and diverse sample of participants ranging from youth to old age.",COPS5 negatively regulates goat endometrial function via the ERN1 and mTOR-autophagy pathways during early pregnancy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927262,Journal of cellular physiology,2019 03 30,"In ruminant, adequate endometrial function is a major factor affecting implantation and economic efficiency. However, the precise mechanisms regulating goat endometrial function during the peri-implantation period of pregnancy are still unclear. Here, we investigated the functional role and signal transduction of the fifth component of the constitutive photomorphogenic-9 signalosome (COPS5) in the regulation of endometrial function in endometrial epithelial cells (EECs). Our results showed that hormones decreased COPS5 expression, and COPS5-mediated regulation of endometrial function. We also found that knockdown of COPS5 hindered EECs proliferation by the G1-phase cell cycle arrest. Hormones affected the activity of COPS5 through hormones receptors, while feedback from the expression of COPS5 regulated the transcription of the receptor. Moreover, knockdown of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to nucleus signaling 1 (ERN1) via si-ERN1 partly inhibited endometrial function in shCOPS5 EECs. In addition, blocking the mTOR pathway by rapamycin promoted endometrial function in si-ERN1-transfected shCOPS5 EECs. Overall, these results suggest that COPS5 negatively regulates goat endometrial function via the ERN1 and mTOR-autophagy pathways and provide new insights into the mechanistic pathways of COPS5 during female reproductive development.",Long noncoding RNA NONHSAG053901 promotes diabetic nephropathy via stimulating Egr-1/TGF-β-mediated renal inflammation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927260,Journal of cellular physiology,2019 03 30,"Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is an important factor leading to end-stage kidney disease that affects diabetes mellitus patients globally. Our previous transcriptome sequencing has identified a large group of differentially expressed long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) in early development of DN. On basis of this, we aimed to investigate the function of lncRNA NONHSAG053901 in DN pathogenesis. In this study, we revealed that the expression of NONHSAG053901 was drastically elevated in both DN mouse model and mesangial cells (MCs). It was found that overexpression of NONHSAG053901 remarkably promoted inflammation, fibrosis and proliferation in MCs. Consistently, further investigations suggested that the stimulation of NONHSAG053901 on proinflammatory cytokines via direct binding to early growth response protein 1 (Egr-1). Interaction between Egr-1 and transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) could augment TGF-β function in DN inflammation. Furthermore, the effects of NONHSAG053901 on stimulation of proinflammatory cytokines were abolished by knockdown of Egr-1. These results together suggested that NONHSAG053901 promoted proinflammatory cytokines via stimulating Egr-1/TGF-β mediated renal inflammation.",Patterns of daily activity among young people with epilepsy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927258,Developmental medicine and child neurology,2019 04 08,"To: (1) explore how young people with epilepsy spend time on physical activity, screen-time, and sleep in a 24-hour period; (2) compare these findings to young people without epilepsy; and (3) evaluate the findings relative to the Canadian 24-hour movement guidelines for children and youth.",Protective effects of microRNA-22-3p against retinal pigment epithelial inflammatory damage by targeting NLRP3 inflammasome.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927257,Journal of cellular physiology,2019 03 30,"NLRP3, as a crucial inflammasome component, plays important roles in age-related macular degeneration. Though some activators of NLRP3 have been studied, microRNAs (miRNAs) which potentially regulate NLRP3 messenger RNA (mRNA) have not been fully explored in retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells and retinopathy. In this study, by miRNA microarray proﬁling and bioinformatic analysis, we identified that four miRNAs, miR-4286, miR-223-3p, miR-365a, miR-22-3p, may target NLRP3 mRNA in RPE inflammatory damage in vivo. Further, real-time polymerase chain reaction verified that only miR-22-3p was significantly decreased, which was associated with NLRP3 upregulation in blue-light-induced retinopathy. Mechanistically, the dual-fluorescent reporter suggested miR-22-3p directly binds NLRP3 mRNA. Moreover, overexpression of miR-22-3p could significantly reduce whereas inhibition miR-22-3p could increase the mRNA and protein expressions of NLRP3, Caspase-1, and mature IL-1β. Collectively, our results indicate that miR-22-3p plays a suppressive role in RPE damage by targeting NLRP3, which provides new insights into the future intervention to retinopathy.",Disentangling data discrepancies with integrated population models.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927256,Ecology,2019 06 03,"A common challenge for studying wildlife populations occurs when different survey methods provide inconsistent or incomplete inference on the trend, dynamics, or viability of a population. A potential solution to the challenge of conflicting or piecemeal data relies on the integration of multiple data types into a unified modeling framework, such as integrated population models (IPMs). IPMs are a powerful approach for species that inhabit spatially and seasonally complex environments. We provide guidance on exploiting the capabilities of IPMs to address inferential discrepancies that stem from spatiotemporal data mismatches. We illustrate this issue with analysis of a migratory species, the American Woodcock (Scolopax minor), in which individual monitoring programs suggest differing population trends. To address this discrepancy, we synthesized several long-term data sets (1963-2015) within an IPM to estimate continental-scale population trends, and link dynamic drivers across the full annual cycle and complete extent of the woodcock's geographic range in eastern North America. Our analysis reveals the limiting portions of the life cycle by identifying time periods and regions where vital rates are lowest and most variable, as well as which demographic parameters constitute the main drivers of population change. We conclude by providing recommendations for resolving conflicting population estimates within an integrated modeling approach, and discuss how strategies (e.g., data thinning, expert opinion elicitation) from other disciplines could be incorporated into ecological analyses when attempting to combine multiple, incongruent data types.",Action of MK-7264 (gefapixant) at human P2X3 and P2X2/3 receptors and in vivo efficacy in models of sensitisation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927255,British journal of pharmacology,2019 06 11,"The P2X3 receptor is an ATP-gated ion channel expressed by sensory afferent neurons and is used as a target to treat chronic sensitisation conditions.

They have contrary effects in the onset of hyperbaric oxygen (HBO)-induced central nervous system oxygen toxicity (CNS OT): ADO can suppress the onset, while NO promotes it. We adopted the ADO-augmenting measure and NO-inhibiting measure in this study and found the combined use had a far superior preventive and therapeutic effect in protecting against CNS OT compared with the use of either measure alone. So we hypothesized that there is an interaction between ADO and NO which has an important impact on the onset of CNS OT. On this basis, we administered ADO-augmenting or ADO-inhibiting drugs to rats. After exposure to HBO, the onset of CNS OT was evaluated, followed by the measurement of NO content in brain tissues. In another experiment, rats were administered NO-augmenting or NO-inhibiting drugs. After exposure to HBO, the onset of CNS OT was evaluated, followed by measurement of the activities of ADO metabolism-related enzymes in brain tissues. The results showed that, following ADO augmentation, the content of NO and its metabolite was significantly reduced, and the onset of CNS OT significantly improved. After ADO inhibition, just the opposite was observed. NO promotion resulted in a decrease in the activity of ADO-producing enzyme, an increase in the activity of ADO-decomposing enzyme, and an aggravation in CNS OT. The above results were all reversed after an inhibition in NO content. Studies have shown that exposure to HBO has a significant impact on the content of ADO and NO in brain tissues as well as their biological effects, and ADO and NO might have an intense interaction, which might generate an important effect on the onset of CNS OT. The prophylaxis and treatment effects of CNS OT can be greatly enhanced by augmenting ADO and inhibiting NO.",Cost Effectiveness of Once-Weekly Semaglutide Versus Once-Weekly Dulaglutide in the Treatment of Type 2 Diabetes in Canada.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927241,PharmacoEconomics - open,2019 03 30,"The aim of this study was to assess the cost effectiveness of semaglutide versus dulaglutide, as an add-on to metformin monotherapy, for the treatment of type 2 diabetes (T2D), from a Canadian societal perspective.",Should familial disease be considered as a negative prognostic factor in micropapillary thyroid carcinoma?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927240,Journal of endocrinological investigation,2019 03 30,"An increased aggressiveness of familial papillary thyroid carcinoma (FPTC) compared with sporadic form has been reported.

While large and centralized institutions are usually considered best suited to meet the increasing demand for high-quality ""biobanks,"" most medical research institutions still host rather heterogeneous and fragmented biobanking activities, undertaken by clinical departments with oftentimes rather different scientific scope. Undoubtedly, most clinicians and medical researchers would appreciate infrastructural support in terms of the storage and handling of their biosamples, but they are also likely to expect access to their samples avoiding extensive formal requirements. We report on the establishment of the PopGen 2.0 Network (P2N), an overarching alliance of initially seven biobanks from Northern Germany which adopted a joint but lean governance structure and use-and-access policy for their samples and data. In addition, the members of P2N have pursued an intense collaboration on ethical, legal and social issues and maintain a common IT infrastructure. The implementation of P2N has substantially improved the prospects of biobank-based research at the participating institutions. The network may thus serve as a role model for similar initiatives geared at linking pre-existing biorepositories for the benefit of research quality, efficiency, and transparency.","Perinatal mortality associated with congenital defects of the central nervous system in Colombia, 2005-2014.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927238,Journal of community genetics,2019 03 30,"In Colombia, congenital anomalies are the second leading cause of death in children aged less than 1 year, and central nervous system (CNS) anomalies are the second most common cause within this group. The aim of the study is to determine the frequency of perinatal mortality attributable to CNS anomalies in Colombia between 2005 and 2014. Using data from the Integral Information System of Social Protection (SISPRO), we determined the perinatal mortality rate associated with CNS anomalies; we also determined frequency of mortality according to age, type of abnormality, year of presentation, and georeferencing. A total of 4706 deaths were recorded to be primarily caused by CNS anomalies (anencephaly and hydrocephalus) in departments and prominent urban centers. The perinatal mortality rate associated with CNS defects has remained relatively constant over the past several years. Major referral centers in the country registered the highest mortality rates. The impact of CNS defects increased with the decrease in infant mortality rates and other health issues. Reinforcement of primary and secondary prevention strategies is warranted for reducing its incidence.",Social-communicative and attention problems in infancy and toddlerhood as precursors of preschool autistic traits.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927236,Attention deficit and hyperactivity disorders,2019 03 30,"This longitudinal study focused on early behavioural problems and autistic traits. In a stratified, population-derived sample of 119 children, mothers reported through questionnaires on externalizing, internalizing, and social-communicative characteristics of their child in infancy (14 months) and toddlerhood (37 months), and on autistic traits at preschool age (4-5 years). Children with consistently normal behaviour from infancy to toddlerhood showed lower autistic traits at preschool age than children with deviant behaviour on one or both time points. High autistic traits at preschool age were predominantly preceded by problems in interaction, communication, language, play, and affect in infancy and/or toddlerhood, but also by inattention in toddlerhood. Adequate support and specific interventions in these domains are needed in an attempt to diminish further derailment of the child's behaviour and development, and to prevent the full manifestation of ASD or related disorders such as ADHD.",Family-based association study on functional α-synuclein polymorphisms in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927235,Attention deficit and hyperactivity disorders,2019 03 30,"Studies have strongly suggested a disturbed regulation of dopaminergic neurotransmission in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). A genetic and phenotypic overlap between both disorders is discussed. A well-studied risk gene for PD is the gene coding for α-synuclein (SNCA). α-Synuclein, a protein located primarily in the presynaptic vesicles, has been suggested to play a role in the modulation of dopamine transporter (DAT) function. DAT is the target of psychostimulants for the treatment of ADHD and plays a key role in regulating the dopamine concentrations in the synaptic cleft. In our sample consisting of German families with children affected by ADHD, we tested for association of allelic variants of two functionally relevant polymorphisms of the α-synuclein gene (NACP-Rep1: 156 families, 232 children; rs356219: 195 families, 284 children) with ADHD. Transmission disequilibrium test analysis revealed no over-transmission for NACP-Rep1 (OR 1, pnom = 1 padj = 1) and rs356219 (OR 1.28; pnom = 0288) in affected siblings. However, a subanalysis on trios with index children showed a nominal association of rs356219 with ADHD (OR 1.43, pnom = 0.020), which survived Bonferroni correction (padj = 0.039); again, no association for NACP-Rep1 (OR 0.8, p = 0.317, padj = 0.634) was found. In conclusion, we found in our pilot study a trend for an association of the rs356219 genotype in SNCA that may affect α-synuclein function and contribute to the aetiology of ADHD. In light of the small sample size of our study, the link between PD and ADHD through dopamine-related neurobiology warrants further investigations. Future studies on SNCA in large ADHD samples should focus on specified symptoms and traits, e.g. attentional capacities or emotional dysregulation.",Effect of disease-associated SLC9A9 mutations on protein-protein interaction networks: implications for molecular mechanisms for ADHD and autism.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927234,Attention deficit and hyperactivity disorders,2019 03 30,"Na+/H+ Exchanger 9 (NHE9) is an endosomal membrane protein encoded by the Solute Carrier 9A, member 9 gene (SLC9A9). SLC9A9 has been implicated in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), epilepsy, multiple sclerosis and cancers. To better understand the function of NHE9 and the effects of disease-associated variants on protein-protein interactions, we conducted a quantitative analysis of the NHE9 interactome using co-immunoprecipitation and isobaric labeling-based quantitative mass spectrometry. We identified 100 proteins that interact with NHE9. These proteins were enriched in known functional pathways for NHE9: the endocytosis, protein ubiquitination and phagosome pathways, as well as some novel pathways including oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, mTOR signaling, cell death and RNA processing pathways. An ADHD-associated mutation (A409P) significantly altered NHE9's interactions with a subset of proteins involved in caveolae-mediated endocytosis and MAP2K2-mediated downstream signaling. An ASD nonsense mutation in SLC9A9, R423X, produced no-detectable amount of NHE9, suggesting the overall loss of NHE9 functional networks. In addition, seven of the NHE9 interactors are products of known autism candidate genes (Simons Foundation Autism Research Initiative, SFARI Gene) and 90% of the NHE9 interactome overlap with SFARI protein interaction network PIN (p < 0.0001), supporting the role of NHE9 interactome in ASDs molecular mechanisms. Our results provide a detailed understanding of the functions of protein NHE9 and its disrupted interactions, possibly underlying ADHD and ASDs. Furthermore, our methodological framework proved useful for functional characterization of disease-associated genetic variants and suggestion of druggable targets.",ADHD: a hidden comorbidity in adult psychiatric patients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927233,Attention deficit and hyperactivity disorders,2019 03 30,"Adult attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (aADHD) has recently been better recognized and treated in many European countries. In spite of this development, aADHD still features as a ""hidden"" comorbidity, often not diagnosed even in patients under psychiatric treatment for other psychiatric disorders. The aim of this study was to establish the prevalence rates of unrecognized aADHD in academic centers providing regular psychiatric services in the Czech Republic and Hungary. In a population of psychiatric in-and outpatients, Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale was administered. All positively and about half of the negatively screened subjects were clinically interviewed and the DSM diagnosis of ADHD was determined based on the symptom list and Conners' Adult ADHD Rating Scale. The estimated point prevalence rate of unrecognized comorbid aADHD among psychiatric in-and out patients was 6.99% (95% lower CI: 5.11, 95% upper CI 8.86) according to the DSM-IV-TR criteria and 9.27% (95% lower CI: 7.13, 95% upper CI 11.40) according to the DSM-5 criteria.

It has been studied and standardized in both children and adults. As a repetitive measurement of treatment efficacy, used both in research and in the clinic, it's important to disprove a practice effect. A retrospective cohort analysis was done, using only the placebo-arm participants from two different randomized, multicenter, double-blind clinical trials on the efficacy of a non-stimulant (metadoxine-XR). In order to reveal the practice effects, only the participants that showed no placebo effect (< 25% improvement), in the Conners' Adult ADHD Rating Scale-investigator rated (CAARS-Inv), the gold standard, were included. Demographic data, CAARS-Inv baseline and TOVA results during each visit were recorded and analyzed. Ninety-one participants from two studies were pooled (2014 n = 24, 2016 n = 67). They did not differ significantly in any demographic parameter, most side effect frequencies, and CAARS-Inv baseline scores. The baseline TOVA performances demonstrated similarity in the degree of inattention, variability, impulsivity, and response time. The TOVA scores were not altered significantly between visits, as assessed by repeated-measures analysis of variance. No significant differences were detected between the TOVA baseline-to-endpoint scores as assessed by paired t test.

Drug exposure can cause a breakdown of immune tolerance to FVIII associated with CD4 T cells, resulting in the induction of autoantibodies against FVIII. In patient 1 in the present series, FVIII inhibitor disappeared after DPP4-I treatment. The DPP4-I treatment was stopped faster in patient 1 than it was in patient 2, whose FVIII inhibitor titer was higher than patient 1's. Two patients died: patient 3 due to brain infarction after recurrence associated with the development of sigmoid colon rupture, and patient 4 due to multiple organ failure associated with Clostridium difficile colitis. DPP4-I treatment may create an ideal environment for the induction of new antibodies and AHA onset associated with tumor necrosis factor-α reduction. These are the first reported cases of the potential development and/or prolonging of AHA after DDP4-I treatment for DM, and they suggest possible disease associations.","Physicochemical and Biological Characterization of RTXM83, a New Rituximab Biosimilar.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927214,"BioDrugs : clinical immunotherapeutics, biopharmaceuticals and gene therapy",2019 05 24,"RTXM83 is a rituximab biosimilar with proven clinical safety and efficacy.

Our review aims to describe the state of the art regarding dietary treatment of EoE, highlighting a number of areas of controversy related to dietary therapy in EoE, including novel modalities for determining food triggers, making the empiric dietary elimination process more efficient, issues of cross-contamination and ""dosing"" of how much food to avoid or add back, costs and effects on quality of life, long-term efficacy, and the risk of developing immediate IgE-type reactions after initial dietary elimination. Elemental formulas, empiric elimination diets, and targeted allergy test-directed elimination diets are well-described treatments for EoE. Although elemental diets are most efficacious, their clinical use is limited by cost and the palatability of an exclusively liquid diet. While empiric elimination is less effective than elemental formula-based diets, they are more easily implemented and often sustainable.

Cell-based models represent individual cells as single particles or as sets of interconnected particles and predict the collective cell behavior that follows from a set of interaction rules. In particular, vertex-based models are a popular tool for studying the mechanics of confluent, epithelial cell layers. They represent the junctions between three (or sometimes more) cells in confluent tissues as point particles, connected using structural elements that represent the cell boundaries. A disadvantage of these models is that cell-cell interfaces are represented as straight lines. This is a suitable simplification for epithelial tissues, where the interfaces are typically under tension, but this simplification may not be appropriate for mesenchymal tissues or tissues that are under compression, such that the cell-cell boundaries can buckle. In this paper, we introduce a variant of VMs in which this and two other limitations of VMs have been resolved. The new model can also be seen as on off-the-lattice generalization of the Cellular Potts Model. It is an extension of the open-source package VirtualLeaf, which was initially developed to simulate plant tissue morphogenesis where cells do not move relative to one another. The present extension of VirtualLeaf introduces a new rule for cell-cell shear or sliding, from which cell rearrangement (T1) and cell extrusion (T2) transitions emerge naturally, allowing the application of VirtualLeaf to problems of animal development. We show that the updated VirtualLeaf yields different results than the traditional vertex-based models for differential adhesion-driven cell sorting and for the neighborhood topology of soft cellular networks.",Prevention of complications from use of conventional immunosuppressants: a critical review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927190,Journal of nephrology,2019 03 30,"Synthetic immunosuppressive drugs are largely used in immune-related renal diseases and in kidney transplantation. Most of these drugs have a low therapeutic index (the ratio that compares the blood concentration at which a drug becomes toxic and the concentration at which the drug is effective), which means that the drug should be dosed carefully and the patient monitored frequently. In this review, we consider the categories of synthetic immunosuppressive agents more frequently and conventionally used in clinical nephrology: glucocorticoids, Aalkylating agents (cyclophosphamide, chlorambucil), purine synthesis inhibitors (azathioprine, mycophenolate salts) and calcineurin inhibitors (cyclosporine, tacrolimus). For each category the possible side effects will be reviewed, the general and specific measures to prevent or treat the adverse events will be suggested, and the more common mistakes that may increase the risk of toxicity will be described. However, the efficacy and safety of immunosuppressive agents depend not only on the pharmacologic characteristics of single drugs but can be influenced also by the clinical condition and genetic characteristics of the patient, by the typology and severity of the underlying disease and by the interaction with other concomitantly used drugs.",The forensic significance of pseudomesotheliomatous adenocarcinoma of the lung.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927189,"Forensic science, medicine, and pathology",2019 03 30,"Pseudomesotheliomatous carcinomas (PMC) are rare tumors that clinically, macroscopically, and sometimes histologically resemble malignant pleural mesotheliomas.

She declined rapidly and died before a histologic diagnosis could be made. Postmortem examination revealed a tumor that diffusely involved the pleural surface with local extension into the chest wall, pericardium, and diaphragm along with a concurrent lung mass. Histologic examination showed poorly-differentiated cells predominantly arranged in sheets, cords, and nests with focal glandular differentiation.

To reduce the current rate of ventilator-induced lung injury requires ventilator settings that are patient-, time-, and disease-specific. A common lung protective strategy is to optimise the level of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) through a recruitment manoeuvre to prevent alveolar collapse at the end of expiration and to improve gas exchange through recruitment of additional alveoli. However, this process can subject parts of the lung to excessively high pressures or volumes. This research significantly extends and more robustly validates a previously developed pulmonary mechanics model to predict lung mechanics throughout recruitment manoeuvres. In particular, the process of recruitment is more thoroughly investigated and the impact of the inclusion of expiratory data when estimating peak inspiratory pressure is assessed. Data from the McREM trial and CURE pilot trial were used to test model predictive capability and assumptions. For PEEP changes of up to and including 14 cmH2O, the parabolic model was shown to improve peak inspiratory pressure prediction resulting in less than 10% absolute error in the CURE cohort and 16% in the McREM cohort. The parabolic model also better captured expiratory mechanics than the exponential model for both cohorts.",In Vivo Estimation of Head Tissue Conductivities Using Bound Constrained Optimization.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927169,Annals of biomedical engineering,2019 05 31,"The conductivity of head tissues was noninvasively estimated using electrical impedance tomography technique. Instead of using conventional unconstrained optimization method to estimate the conductivities, a constrained method with the scaled-logistic function was employed to improve the very high sensitivity of the skull region resulting in accuracy and robustness improvement. Estimation of five conductivities i.e. scalp, skull, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), grey matter (GM), and white matter (WM) conductivity was investigated by simulation on random and low-value initial guesses. Simulation results showed that the performance of the unconstrained method depended directly to the difference between the exact skull conductivity value and the initial guess value of the skull conductivity. However, the approached constrained method was independent of the guess selection. It can reduce the sensitivity of the skull region by 126 times and reduce the condition number of the sensitivity matrix by 13-17 times. The estimation resulted in only positive and in-range of reported conductivity values. The estimation error of the skull conductivity decreased by 15% and the robustness increased by 2 times. However, the estimation of the CSF, the WM, and the GM may be not reliable due to the very low sensitivity of these regions in both methods.",Learning from Our Patients: Training Psychiatry Residents in Refugee Mental Health.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927166,Academic psychiatry : the journal of the American Association of Directors of Psychiatric Residency Training and the Association for Academic Psychiatry,2019 03 30,"Psychiatric residents are increasingly called upon to work cross-culturally, serving diverse populations including refugees.

In Malaysian Borneo, increases in human infections by the zoonotic malaria Plasmodium knowlesi are hypothesised to be due to increasing contact between people and macaques due to deforestation. To explore how macaque responses to environmental change impact disease risks, we analysed movement of a GPS-collared long-tailed macaque in a knowlesi-endemic area in Sabah, Malaysia, during a deforestation event. Land-cover maps were derived from satellite-based and aerial remote sensing data and models of macaque occurrence were developed to evaluate how macaque habitat use was influenced by land-use change. During deforestation, changes were observed in macaque troop home range size, movement speeds and use of different habitat types. Results of models were consistent with the hypothesis that macaque ranging behaviour is disturbed by deforestation events but begins to equilibrate after seeking and occupying a new habitat, potentially impacting human disease risks. Further research is required to explore how these changes in macaque movement affect knowlesi epidemiology on a wider spatial scale.",Obesity and hiatal hernia may be non-allergic risk factors for esophageal eosinophilia in Japanese adults.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927164,Esophagus : official journal of the Japan Esophageal Society,2019 03 30,"Esophageal eosinophilia (EE) is a basal condition of eosinophilic esophageal disorders including eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) and asymptomatic EE.

By comparison, the role of compulsivity in addictive behaviors has received less research focus. The neurocognitive literature to date is vast, and it is unclear whether there are any convincing lines of systematic evidence delineating whether and how aspects of impulsivity and compulsivity are shared and unique across different substance and behavioral addictive disorders. Such information has significant implications for our understanding of underlying mechanisms and clinical implications for assessing and treating neurocognitive deficits across addictions. Here, we conducted a systematic meta-review of the quantitative meta-analyses to date, specifically examining the neurocognitive functions central to impulsive-compulsive behaviors transdiagnostically across addictive behaviors. Out of 1186 empirical studies initially identified, six meta-analyses met inclusion criteria examining alcohol, cannabis, cocaine, MDMA, methamphetamine, opioid and tobacco use, as well as gambling and internet addiction. The pooled findings across the systematic meta-analyses suggest that impulsivity is a core process underpinning both substance and behavioral addictive disorders, although it is not equally implicated across all substances. Compulsivity-related neurocognition, by comparison, is important across alcohol and gambling disorders, but has yet to be examined systematically. The gestalt of findings to date suggests that both impulsivity and compulsivity are core constructs linked to addictive behaviors and may not be solely the secondary sequelae associated with the effects of prolonged substance exposure.",Individualized treatment of head neck squamous cell carcinoma patients aged 70 or older with radiotherapy alone or associated to cisplatin or cetuximab: impact of weekly radiation dose on loco-regional control.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927146,"Medical oncology (Northwood, London, England)",2019 05 01,"The purpose of this study is to evaluate if, in elderly HNC patients, loco-regional control (LRC) is influenced by average weekly radiation dose (AWD). From 2009 to 2017, 150 consecutive HNC elderly patients were analyzed. AWD was calculated by dividing total dose in Gray by overall treatment time in weeks. Patients were divided in 2 groups: Group 1 (70-75 years) and Group 2 (> 75 years). Primary endpoint was LRC; secondary endpoints were overall survival (OS) and compliance to treatment. The median age was 76 years (range 70-92), the distribution of patients by age was 72 and 78 patients in Group 1 and in Group 2, respectively; overall median follow-up was 23 months. Optimal cut-off of AWD for LRC was 9.236 (p = 0.018). Median OS was 73 months. In univariate survival analysis low PS (p = 0.005), T3-T4 (p = 0.021), Stage III-IV (p = 0.046) and AWDLow (< 9.236) (p = 0.018) were significantly associated with lower LRC; low PS (p < 0.001) and Group 2 (p = 0.006) were also associated with lower OS. Considering patients treated with radiotherapy alone AWDLow was significantly associated with lower LRC (p = 0.04) whereas among patient treated with chemoradiotherapy AWD did not affected LRC (p = 0.18). The multivariate analysis confirmed the significant value of PS for the prediction of LRC and OS (p = 0.035 and p < 0.001, respectively). In elderly patients an AWD of > 9.236 Gy was found to be beneficial for RT alone regimen. When radiotherapy alone is indicated in elderly patients an effort should be made to maintain an increased AWD in order to improve LRC.",A closer look at the stoma: multimodal imaging of patients with ileostomies and colostomies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927144,Insights into imaging,2019 04 16,"Nowadays, large numbers of ileostomies and colostomies are created during surgical management of a variety of intestinal disorders. Depending on indication, surgical technique and emergency versus elective conditions, stomas may be either temporary or permanent. As a result, patients with ileostomies and colostomies are commonly encountered in Radiology departments, particularly during perioperative hospitalisation following stoma creation or before recanalisation, and when needing CT or MRI studies for follow-up of operated tumours or chronic inflammatory bowel diseases. However, the stoma site is commonly overlooked on cross-sectional imaging.Aiming to improve radiologists' familiarity with stoma-related issues, this pictorial essay concisely reviews indications and surgical techniques for ileostomies and colostomies, and presents state-of-the art multimodal imaging in patients living with a stoma, including water-soluble contrast stomal enema (WSC-SE), CT and MRI techniques, interpretation and expected findings. Afterwards, the clinical features and imaging appearances of early and late stoma-related complications are illustrated with imaging examples, including diversion colitis.When interpreting cross-sectional imaging studies, focused attention to the stoma site and awareness of expected appearances and of possible complications are required to avoid missing significant changes requiring clinical attention. Additionally, dedicated imaging techniques such as WSC-SE and combined CT plus WSC-SE may be helpful to provide surgeons the appropriate clinical information required to direct management.",miR-650 promotes motility of anaplastic thyroid cancer cells by targeting PPP2CA.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927143,Endocrine,2019 03 30,"Aberrant expression of miRNAs is crucial in several tissues tumorigenesis including thyroid.

Phenotypically it seems to be a well-defined condition, with two main clinical forms: mild (attenuated) and severe, which are determined based on a combination of symptoms, i.e., enzymatic activity of GALNS, age of onset, and symptom severity. Nevertheless, the natural history of MPSIVA in relation to specific anthropometric parameters (growth, head circumference, body proportions, and face phenotype) is not precisely characterized. The aim of our work was to analyze the aforementioned anthropometric parameters, including correlation to molecular data (causative GALNS mutations).",Transitive inference in pigeons may result from differential tendencies to reject the test stimuli acquired during training.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927140,Animal cognition,2019 03 30,"In the five-term, transitive inference task used with animals, pigeons are trained on four simultaneous discrimination premise pairs: A + B -, B + C -, C + D -, D + E -. Typically, when tested with the BD pair, most pigeons show a transitive inference effect, choosing B over D. Two non-inferential hypotheses have been proposed to account for this effect but neither has been reliably supported by research. Here we test a third non-inferential hypothesis that the preference for B arises because the animals have not had as much experience with B - in the A + B - discrimination as they have had with the D - in the C + D - discrimination. To test this hypothesis we trained the Experimental Group with the A + B - discrimination in which, over trials, there were four possible A + stimuli that could appear. This was done to encourage the pigeons to learn to reject the B - stimulus. For the Control Group there was only one A + stimulus over trials, as is typically the case. We also varied the nature of the stimuli between groups, such that colors served as the stimuli for half of the pigeons, whereas flags of different counties served as stimuli for the remaining pigeons. In both stimulus conditions, for the Experiment Group, we found little preference for stimulus B over stimulus D, whereas for the Control Group we found the typical preference for stimulus B. Thus, we propose that it is not necessary to attribute the transitive inference effect to an inferential process.",Degenerative and acquired sporadic adult onset ataxia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927137,Neurological sciences : official journal of the Italian Neurological Society and of the Italian Society of Clinical Neurophysiology,2019 03 30,"The diagnosis of sporadic adult onset ataxia is a challenging task since a large collection of hereditary and non-hereditary disorders should be taken into consideration. Sporadic adult onset ataxias include degenerative non-hereditary, hereditary, and acquired ataxias. Multiple system atrophy and idiopathic late cerebellar ataxia are degenerative non-hereditary ataxias. Late-onset Friedreich's ataxia, spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 and 2, and fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome account for most sporadic hereditary ataxias. Alcoholic cerebellar degeneration, paraneoplastic and other autoimmune cerebellar degeneration, vitamin deficiencies, and toxic-induced and infectious cerebellar syndrome are the main causes of acquired cerebellar degeneration.

Nowadays improving antibiotics occupies an important place in the pharmaceutical industry as more and more resistant microorganisms are developing. Mupirocin is used to control the MRSA outbreaks, for infections of soft tissue or skin and for nasal decolonization. Due to its wide use without prescription, the microorganism's resistance to Mupirocin increased from up to 81%, thus becoming imperative its control or improvement. As the biotechnological production of Mupirocin has not been previously reviewed, in the present paper we summarize some consideration on the biochemical process for the production of pseudomonic acids (submerged fermentation and product recovery). Different strains of Pseudomonas, different culture medium and different conditions for the fermentation were analysed related to the antibiotics yield and the product recovery step is analysed in relation to the final purity. However, many challenges have to be overcome in order to obtain pseudomonic acid new versions with better properties related to antibacterial activity.",Thermostable CITase from Thermoanaerobacter thermocopriae shows negative cooperativity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927134,Biotechnology letters,2019 04 25,The biochemical properties of a putative thermostable cycloisomaltooligosaccharide (CI) glucanotransferase gene from Thermoanaerobacter thermocopriae were determined using a recombinant protein (TtCITase) expressed in Escherichia coli and purified to a single protein.

Therefore, HRA detection rate (HR-ADR) as a QI in addition to ADR may further enhance the efficacy of screening colonoscopy. Our aim was to calculate ADR and HR-ADR in a large cohort of average risk screening colonoscopy patients and propose HR-ADR which correlates with current threshold ADR.",Looking beyond the flowers: associations of stingless bees with sap-sucking insects.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927121,Die Naturwissenschaften,2019 05 02,"The main sources of food for stingless bees are the nectar and pollen harvested from flowers, whereas one important kind of nesting material (i.e. wax) is produced by their own abdominal glands. Stingless bees can, nonetheless, obtain alternative resources of food and wax from exudates released by sap-sucking insects as honeydew and waxy cover, respectively. To date, there are no comprehensive studies investigating how diversified and structured the network interactions between stingless bees and sap-sucking insects are. Here, we conducted a survey of the data on relationship between stingless bees and sap-sucking insects to evaluate: (1) which resources are collected by which stingless bee species; (2) how diverse the interaction network is, using species degree and specialisation index as a proxy; and if (3) there would be any phylogenetic signal in the species degree and specialisation indices. Our findings demonstrate that approximately 21 stingless bee species like Trigona spp. and Oxytrigona spp. have been observed interacting with 11 sap-sucking species, among which Aethalion reticulatum is the main partner. From ca. 50 records, Brazil is the country with most observations (n = 38) of this type of ecological interaction. We found also that stingless bees harvest fivefold more honeydew than waxy covers on sap-sucking insects. However, we did not find any phylogenetic signal for the occurrence of this interaction, considering species degree and specialisation indices, suggesting that both traits apparently evolved independently among stingless bee species. We suggest that specific ecological demands may drive this opportunistic behaviour exhibited by stingless bees, because major sources of food are obtained from flowers and these bees produce their own wax.",Fatal Enteroviral Encephalitis in a Patient with Common Variable Immunodeficiency Harbouring a Novel Mutation in NFKB2.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927119,Journal of clinical immunology,2019 06 10,"Common variable immunodeficiency is the most prevalent of the primary immunodeficiency diseases, yet its pathogenesis is largely poorly understood. Of the cases that are monogenic, many arise due to pathogenic variants in NFKB1 and NFKB2. Here, we report enteroviral encephalomyelitis as the cause of a fatal neurodegenerative condition in a patient with a novel heterozygous mutation in NFKB2 (c.2543insG, p.P850Sfs36*) that disrupts non-canonical NF-κB signaling. Investigations of primary and secondary lymphoid tissue demonstrated a complete absence of B cells and germinal centers. Despite multiple negative viral PCR testing of cerebrospinal fluid during her disease progression, post-mortem analysis of cerebral tissue revealed a chronic lymphocytic meningoencephalitis, in the presence of Cocksackie A16 virus, as the cause of death. The clinical features, and progression of disease reported here, demonstrate divergent clinical and immunological phenotypes of individuals within a single family. This is the first reported case of fatal enteroviral encephalomyelitis in a patient with NF-κB2 deficiency and mandates a low threshold for early brain biopsy and the administration of increased immunoglobulin replacement in any patient with a defect in this pathway and deterioration of neurological status.",Microstructure and Mechanical Properties of Graphene Oxide-Reinforced Titanium Matrix Composites Synthesized by Hot-Pressed Sintering.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927118,Nanoscale research letters,2019 04 18,"Ti matrix composites reinforced with 1-5 wt% graphene oxide (GO) were prepared by hot-pressed sintering in argon atmosphere. The effect of sintering temperature on the microstructures and mechanical properties of the composite was also evaluated. The results show that TiC nanoparticles were formed in situ as interfacial products via the reaction between Ti and GO during sintering. With increases in GO content and sintering temperature, the amount of TiC increased, improving the mechanical properties of the composites. GO was also partly retained with a lamellar structure after sintering. The composite reinforced with 5 wt% GO exhibited a hardness of 457 HV, 48.4% higher than that of pure Ti at 1473 K. The Ti-2.5 wt% GO composite sintered at 1473 K achieved a maximum yield stress of 1294 MPa, which was 62.7 % higher than that of pure Ti. Further increasing the GO content to 5 wt% led to a slight decrease in yield stress owing to GO agglomeration. The fracture morphology of the composite reinforced with GO exhibited a quasi-cleavage fracture, whereas that of the pure Ti matrix showed a ductile fracture. The main strengthening mechanism included grain refinement, solution strengthening, and dispersion strengthening of TiC and GO.",Neutralizing Antibody Assay Development with High Drug and Target Tolerance to Support Clinical Development of an Anti-TFPI Therapeutic Monoclonal Antibody.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927117,The AAPS journal,2019 05 10,"Immunogenicity is a major challenge for protein therapeutics which can potentially reduce drug efficacy and safety and is often being monitored by anti-drug antibody (ADA) and neutralizing antibody (NAb) assays. Circulating targets and residual drugs in matrices can have significant impacts on accuracy of results from ADA and NAb assays, and sufficient drug and target tolerance for these assays are necessary. Here, we report the development of a competitive ligand binding (CLB) NAb assay for an anti-TFPI (tissue factor pathway inhibitor) monoclonal antibody (PF-06741086) with high drug and target tolerance to support ongoing clinical studies. A double acid affinity capture elution approach was used to mitigate drug interference, and a robust target removal strategy was employed to enhance target tolerance. The validated NAb assay has sensitivity of 313 ng/mL, drug tolerance of 50 μg/mL, and target tolerance of 1200 ng/mL. A step-by-step tutorial of assay development is described in this manuscript along with the rationale for using a high drug/target tolerant NAb assay. The NAb assay cut point factor obtained was 0.78. Other assay performance characteristics, e.g., precision and selectivity, are also discussed. This validated method demonstrated a superior drug and target tolerance to warrant specific and precise characterization of the NAb responses in support of ongoing clinical studies.",Gout and chronic pain in older adults: a Medicare claims study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927116,Clinical rheumatology,2019 06 16,"To assess if gout is associated with a higher risk of incident chronic pain. This study used the 2006-2012 Medicare claims data. We used multivariable-adjusted Cox regression analyses to examine the association of pre-existing diagnosis of gout with incident (new) diagnosis of chronic pain, adjusting for demographics, medical comorbidity, and use of common medications for cardiovascular disease and gout. Sensitivity analyses substituted Charlson-Romano score with a categorical variable or each Charlson-Romano comorbidity. There were 1,321,521 eligible people, of whom 424,518 developed incident chronic pain. Crude incidence rates of chronic pain were as follows: gout, 158.1 per 1000 person-years and no gout, 64.5 per 1000 person-years. In multivariable-adjusted Cox regression analyses, gout was associated with higher hazard ratio of chronic pain, 2.02 (95% CI, 1.98, 2.05), confirmed in sensitivity analyses 1.96 (95% CI, 1.93, 1.99) (model 2) and 1.77 (95% CI, 1.74, 1.80) (model 3). No meaningful differences were found by gender and race in subgroup analyses; slightly lower hazard of chronic pain with gout was seen in oldest people. Use of allopurinol or febuxostat was associated with lower risk of chronic pain, 0.79 (95% CI, 0.77, 0.82; model 1) and 0.72 (95% CI, 0.56, 0.92; model 1). Gout was associated with a doubling of the risk of chronic pain and gout treatments with reduction in the risk. Efforts must be made to optimize gout control, so that chronic pain can be avoided as a long-term sequalae of gout and when present, treated early and appropriately. Key points • Gout was associated with twofold higher risk of incident (or new) diagnosis of chronic pain. • Gout treatments were associated with a lower chronic pain risk. • Increased risk of chronic pain with gout was similar across age, race, and sex. • Studies should examine if optimal gout control with treat-to-target approach can reduce the risk of chronic pain in people with gout.",Rheumatic associations of autoimmune thyroid disease: a systematic review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927115,Clinical rheumatology,2019 06 16,"To investigate specific disease patterns in the rheumatic manifestations associated with autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD) through a systematic literature review.

A total of 2132 articles were identified. After title and abstract screening and removal of duplicates, 66 articles were retrieved for full text review. Eighteen studies were deemed eligible for inclusion. Six observational studies reported up to 45% prevalence of DJD in AITD. Hand and spinal DJD were reportedly associated with higher odds of AITD. Twelve observational studies were retrieved reporting up to 62% prevalence of FMS in AITD patients. Four studies described the occurrence of seronegative IA in AITD patients. The rheumatic associations of AITD may manifest specific patterns of disease distinct from those of other well-defined autoimmune syndromes and contribute significantly to disease burden.","Gender, HIV-Related Stigma, and Health-Related Quality of Life Among Adults Enrolling in HIV Care in Tanzania.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927114,AIDS and behavior,2019 04 20,"HIV-related stigma has been associated with worse health-related quality of life (HRQoL) among people living with HIV (PLWH). Little is known about how different types of HIV-related stigma (i.e., anticipatory, internalized, or enacted HIV-related stigma) influence HRQoL and whether these relationships differ by gender. The sample included 912 PLWH aged 18 years or older enrolling in HIV care at four health facilities in Tanzania. HRQoL was assessed with the life satisfaction and overall function subscales of the HIV/AIDS-Targeted Quality of Life (HAT-QoL) instrument. Sex-stratified multivariable logistic regression modeled the association of anticipatory, internalized, and enacted HIV-related stigma on poor HRQoL. Across all participants, the mean life satisfaction score was 63.4 (IQR: 43.8, 81.3) and the mean overall function score was 72.0 (IQR: 58.3, 91.7). Mean HRQoL scores were significantly higher for women compared to men for overall function (5.1 points higher) and life satisfaction (4.3 points higher). Fourteen percent of respondents reported recent enacted HIV-related stigma and 13% reported recent medium or high levels of internalized stigma. In multivariable models, high internalized and high anticipatory stigma were significantly associated with higher odds of poor life satisfaction and poor overall function in both men and women. Psychosocial interventions to prevent or reduce the impact of internalized and anticipatory stigma may improve HRQoL among persons in HIV care.

However, its biggest drawback is its subjectivity. The results depend on the experience and ability of the doctor to perceive and distinguish pathologies in sounds heard via a stethoscope. This paper investigates a new method of automatic sound analysis based on neural networks (NNs), which has been implemented in a system that uses an electronic stethoscope for capturing respiratory sounds. It allows the detection of auscultatory sounds in four classes: wheezes, rhonchi, and fine and coarse crackles. In the blind test, a group of 522 auscultatory sounds from 50 pediatric patients were presented, and the results provided by a group of doctors and an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm developed by the authors were compared. The gathered data show that machine learning (ML)-based analysis is more efficient in detecting all four types of phenomena, which is reflected in high values of recall (also called as sensitivity) and F1-score.Conclusions: The obtained results suggest that the implementation of automatic sound analysis based on NNs can significantly improve the efficiency of this form of examination, leading to a minimization of the number of errors made in the interpretation of auscultation sounds. What is Known: • Auscultation performance of average physician is very low. AI solutions presented in scientific literature are based on small data bases with isolated pathological sounds (which are far from real recordings) and mainly on leave-one-out validation method thus they are not reliable.

It is modified throughout life and it is determined by the particular anatomical characteristics that directly affect the biomechanics of the spine. The typing of the spinal curvature is important for the knowledge of body posture. The possibility of having a method for the systematic postural characterization of the spine is an essential objective resource in order to obtain normal or control patterns of the spinal morphology of the population. A widely accepted methodology of morphological characterization of the spine is a necessary requirement for the establishment of preventive criteria for spinal pathologies based on epidemiological population studies. It also represents a necessary requirement for the classification of individuals, based on the biomechanical, orthopaedic or ergonomic criteria necessary for disciplines such as sports, industrial design or sports performance. The present study proposes the development of a morphological postural model of the spine in the lumbar region. The model is based on a system of measurement of objective and comparable parameters by means of X-ray analysis, in order to characterize its morphology in the sagittal plane. The comparison of the results in a population of 47 individuals allowed the possibility to carry out a statistical study on three morphological parameters: sacral angle (α1); reversal angle (α2) and degree of lordosis (DL).

Moreover, antioxidant, antiangiogenesis and cytotoxicity of the RFP/Ag-NPs against MDA-MB-231, MCF7 and carcinoma cell lines and normal human skin fibroblast HDF were compared. Results indicated that RFP/Ag-NPs have a peak at 430 nm, spherical shape and an average size of 24 nm. According to the results of FTIR, rapeseed pollen capped Ag-NPs. RFP/Ag-NPs have cytotoxicity on MDA-MB-231 and MCF7 cells and decrease cancerous cell viability (IC50 = 3 µg/ml and 2 µg/ml, respectively) in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The morphological data showed that the RFP/Ag-NPs increase the percentage of apoptotic cells compared to the control group and normal cells (human skin fibroblast cells). The apoptotic morphological change was also confirmed with a flow cytometric analysis. RFP/ Ag-NPs' antioxidant activity was evaluated by measuring their ability to scavenge ABTS and DPPH free radicals. The IC50 values were determined at 800 and 830 μg/ml for ABTS and DPPH tests, respectively. According to the results, green-synthesized RFP/Ag-NPs as a safe efficient apoptosis inducer and strong antioxidant compound have the potential to suppress breast cancer carcinogenesis by VEGF down-regulatiion and thus sensitizing them against apoptosis. However, further researches are required to clarify RFP/Ag-NPs' cell specificity and therapeutic doses in in vivo conditions.",Cebranopadol: A Novel First-in-Class Potent Analgesic Acting via NOP and Opioid Receptors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927089,Handbook of experimental pharmacology,2019 03 30,"Cebranopadol is a novel first-in-class analgesic with highly potent agonistic activity at nociceptin/orphanin FQ peptide (NOP) and opioid receptors. It is highly potent and efficacious across a broad range of preclinical pain models. Its side effect profile is better compared to typical opioids. Mechanistic studies have shown that cebranopadol's activity at NOP receptors contributes to its anti-hyperalgesic effects while ameliorating some of its opioid-type side effects, including respiratory depression and abuse potential.

Accruing evidence suggests that α-syn pathology can propagate through neuronal circuits in the brain, contributing to the progressive nature of the disease. Thus, it is therapeutically pertinent to identify modifiers of α-syn transmission and aggregation as potential targets to slow down disease progression. A growing number of genetic mutations and risk factors has been identified in studies of familial and sporadic forms of PD. However, how these genes affect α-syn aggregation and pathological transmission, and whether they can be targeted for therapeutic interventions, remains unclear. We performed a targeted genetic screen of risk genes associated with PD and parkinsonism for modifiers of α-syn aggregation, using an α-syn preformed-fibril (PFF) induction assay. We found that decreased expression of Lrrk2 and Gba modulated α-syn aggregation in mouse primary neurons. Conversely, α-syn aggregation increased in primary neurons from mice expressing the PD-linked LRRK2 G2019S mutation. In vivo, using LRRK2 G2019S transgenic mice, we observed acceleration of α-syn aggregation and degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the SNpc, exacerbated degeneration-associated neuroinflammation and behavioral deficits. To validate our findings in a human context, we established a novel human α-syn transmission model using induced pluripotent stem cell (iPS)-derived neurons (iNs), where human α-syn PFFs triggered aggregation of endogenous α-syn in a time-dependent manner. In PD subject-derived iNs, the G2019S mutation enhanced α-syn aggregation, whereas loss of LRRK2 decreased aggregation. Collectively, these findings establish a strong interaction between the PD risk gene LRRK2 and α-syn transmission across mouse and human models. Since clinical trials of LRRK2 inhibitors in PD are currently underway, our findings raise the possibility that these may be effective in PD broadly, beyond cases caused by LRRK2 mutations.",GCN5 modulates trichome initiation in Arabidopsis by manipulating histone acetylation of core trichome initiation regulator genes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927071,Plant cell reports,2019 06 10,"Histone acetyltransferase GCN5 affects trichome initiation via mediating the expression of some core trichome initiation regulator genes in Arabidopsis. GENERAL CONTROL NON-REPRESSED PROTEIN5 (GCN5), a histone acetyltransferase involved in the regulation of cell differentiation, organ development, secondary metabolism, and plant responses to abiotic stresses, has recently been shown to modulate trichome branching in Arabidopsis. Here, we provide evidence that GCN5 is also involved in the regulation of trichome initiation. We found that mutation of GCN5 led to increased leaf trichome density in Arabidopsis. Quantitative RT-PCR results showed that the expression of CPC, GL1, GL2, and GL3, four well-known core trichome initiation regulator genes, was decreased in the gcn5 mutants. ChIP assays indicated that these four trichome initiation regulator genes are direct targets of GCN5. Consistent with these results, GCN5-mediated H3K14/K9 acetylation levels on the TSS regions of these genes were decreased. On the other hand, leaf trichome density was reduced in plants overexpressing GCN5, and both the transcript levels and GCN5-binding enrichments of CPC, GL1, GL2, and GL3 genes were elevated. Taken together, these data suggests that GCN5 affects trichome initiation by modulating the transcription activities of trichome initiation regulator genes via H3K9/14 acetylation.",[Comparison of visual acuity measurement with Landolt rings versus numbers].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927070,Der Ophthalmologe : Zeitschrift der Deutschen Ophthalmologischen Gesellschaft,2019 03 30,"Landolt rings are commonly used for the measurement of visual acuity, especially for legal purposes.

In SDs, the affected puppies are born with sparse hair but lose it within the first 2 months leaving the dogs completely hairless. The previous studies have implicated variants in FOXI3 and SGK3 in hairlessness; however, the known variants do not explain hairlessness in all breeds such as SDs. We investigated the genetic cause in 66 SDs, including a litter with two hairless dogs. We utilized a combined approach of genome-wide homozygosity mapping and whole-genome sequencing of a hairless SD followed by recessive filtering according to a recessive model against 340 control genomes. Only two homozygous-coding variants were discovered in the homozygosity regions, including a 1-bp insertion in exon 2 of SGK3. This results in a predicted frameshift and very early truncation (49/490 amino acids) of the SGK3 protein. Additional screening of the recessive variant demonstrated a full segregation with the hairlessness and a 12% carrier frequency in the SD breed. The variant was not found in the related Irish Wolfhound breed. This study identifies the second hairless variant in the SGK3 gene in dogs and further highlights its role as a candidate gene for androgen-independent hair loss or alopecia in human.",Interleukin-6 contributes to initiation of neuronal regeneration program in the remote dorsal root ganglia neurons after sciatic nerve injury.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927067,Histochemistry and cell biology,2019 03 30,"To assess the potential role of IL-6 in sciatic nerve injury-induced activation of a pro-regenerative state in remote dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons, we compared protein levels of SCG-10 and activated STAT3, as well as axon regeneration in IL-6 knockout (IL-6ko) mice and their wild-type (WT) counterparts. Unilateral sciatic nerve compression and transection upregulated SCG-10 protein levels and activated STAT3 in DRG neurons not only in lumbar but also in cervical segments of WT mice. A pro-regenerative state induced by prior sciatic nerve lesion in cervical DRG neurons of WT mice was also shown by testing for axon regeneration in crushed ulnar nerve. DRG neurons from IL-6ko mice also displayed bilaterally increased levels of SCG-10 and STAT3 in both lumbar and cervical segments after sciatic nerve lesions. However, levels of SCG-10 protein in lumbar and cervical DRG of IL-6ko mice were significantly lower than those of their WT counterparts. Sciatic nerve injury induced a lower level of SCG-10 in cervical DRG of IL-6ko than WT mice, and this correlates with significantly shorter regeneration of axons distal to the crushed ulnar nerve. These results suggest that IL-6 contributes, at the very least, to initiation of the neuronal regeneration program in remote DRG neurons after unilateral sciatic nerve injury.",Epidural analgesia vs systemic opioids in patients undergoing laparoscopic colorectal surgery.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927065,International journal of colorectal disease,2019 04 21,"A well-controlled pain is one of the most important targets of enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocols.

Tiller angle of cereal crops is a key agronomic trait that contributes to grain production. An understanding of how tiller angle is controlled is helpful for achieving ideal plant architecture to improve grain yield. Phytochrome-interacting factors (PIFs) are known to regulate seed germination, seedling skotomorphogenesis, shade avoidance, and flowering in Arabidopsis thaliana. Here, we report that OsPIL15 is, indeed, a rice PIF that negatively regulates tiller angle. Dominant-negative OsPIL15 plants displayed a larger tiller angle, which was associated with reduced shoot gravitropism. Phytochrome B (phyB) is the main photoreceptor perceiving the low red:far-red ratio of shade light. Compared with wild-type rice plants, loss-of-function phyB plants and OsPIL15-overexpressing plants showed smaller tiller angles and enhanced shoot gravitropism. In addition, more OsPIL15 protein accumulated in phyB plants than in wild-type plants. Light regulates the level of the OsPIL15 protein negatively, depending on phyB partially. We propose that OsPIL15 integrates light and gravity signals to regulate tiller angle in rice.",ESCRT-III accessory proteins regulate fungal development and plant infection in Fusarium graminearum.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927052,Current genetics,2019 03 30,"Ubiquitinated biosynthetic and surface proteins destined for degradation are sorted into the lysosome/vacuole via the multivesicular body sorting pathway, which depends on the function of ESCRT machinery. Fusarium head blight (FHB) caused by Fusarium graminearum is one of the most devastating diseases for wheat and barley worldwide. To better understand the role of ESCRT machinery in F. graminearum, we investigated the function of ESCRT-III accessory proteins FgVps60, FgDid2 and FgIst1 in this study. FgVps60-GFP, FgDid2-GFP and FgIst1-GFP are localized to punctate structures adjacent to the vacuolar membrane except for FgIst1-GFP that is also found in the nucleus. Then, the gene deletion mutants ΔFgvps60, ΔFgdid2 and ΔFgist1 displayed defective growth to a different extent. ΔFgvps60 and ΔFgdid2 but not ΔFgist1 also showed significant reduction in hydrophobicity on cell surface, conidiation, perithecia production and virulence. Interestingly, ΔFgist1 mutant produced a significantly higher level of DON while showing a minor reduction in pathogenicity. Microscopic analyses revealed that FgVps60 but not FgIst1 and FgDid2 is necessary for endocytosis. Moreover, spontaneous mutations were identified in the ΔFgvps60 mutant that partially rescued its defects in growth and conidiation. Taken together, we conclude that ESCRT-III accessory proteins play critical roles in growth, reproduction and plant infection in F. graminearum.",Monte Carlo single-cell dosimetry using Geant4-DNA: the effects of cell nucleus displacement and rotation on cellular S values.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927051,Radiation and environmental biophysics,2019 03 30,"Investigation of biological effects of low-dose ionizing radiation at the (sub-) cellular level, which is referred to as microdosimetry, remains a major challenge of today's radiobiology research. Monte Carlo simulation of radiation tracks can provide a detailed description of the physical processes involved in dimensions as small as the critical substructures of the cell. Hereby, in the present study, microdosimetric calculations of cellular S values for mono-energetic electrons and six Auger-emitting radionuclides were performed in single-cell models of liquid water using Geant4-DNA. The effects of displacement and rotation of the nucleus within the cell on the cellular S values were studied in spherical and ellipsoidal geometries. It was found that for the examined electron energies and radionuclides, in the case of nucleus cross-absorption where the radioactivity is either localized in the cytoplasm of the cell or distributed on the cell surface, rotation of the nucleus within the cell affects cellular S values less than displacement of the nucleus. Especially, the considerable differences observed in S(nucleus ← cell surface) values between an eccentric and a concentric cell-nucleus configuration in spherical and ellipsoidal geometries (up to 63% and up to 44%, respectively) suggests that the approximation of concentricity should be used with caution, at least for localized irradiation of the cell membrane by an Auger-emitter in targeted radionuclide cancer therapy. The obtained results, which are based on a more realistic modeling of the cell than was done before, provide more accurate information about nuclear dose. This can be useful for theranostic applications.",α-Mangostin suppresses NLRP3 inflammasome activation via promoting autophagy in LPS-stimulated murine macrophages and protects against CLP-induced sepsis in mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927050,Inflammation research : official journal of the European Histamine Research Society ...

[et al.],2019 06 10,"The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) family includes three transcription factors: PPARα, PPARβ/δ, and PPARγ. PPAR are nuclear receptors activated by oxidised and nitrated fatty acid derivatives as well as by cyclopentenone prostaglandins (PGA2 and 15d-PGJ2) during the inflammatory response. This results in the modulation of the pro-inflammatory response, preventing it from being excessively activated. Other activators of these receptors are nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) and fatty acids, especially polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) (arachidonic acid, ALA, EPA, and DHA). The main function of PPAR during the inflammatory reaction is to promote the inactivation of NF-κB. Possible mechanisms of inactivation include direct binding and thus inactivation of p65 NF-κB or ubiquitination leading to proteolytic degradation of p65 NF-κB. PPAR also exert indirect effects on NF-κB. They promote the expression of antioxidant enzymes, such as catalase, superoxide dismutase, or heme oxygenase-1, resulting in a reduction in the concentration of reactive oxygen species (ROS), i.e., secondary transmitters in inflammatory reactions. PPAR also cause an increase in the expression of IκBα, SIRT1, and PTEN, which interferes with the activation and function of NF-κB in inflammatory reactions.",Role of adiponectin in the metabolism of skeletal muscles in collagen VI-related myopathies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927046,"Journal of molecular medicine (Berlin, Germany)",2019 06 10,"The role of adiponectin has been particularly deepened in diabetic muscles while the study of adiponectin in hereditary myopathies has been marginally investigated. Here, we report the study about adiponectin effects in Col6a1-/- (collagen VI-null) mice. Col6a1-/- mice show myophatic phenotype closer to that of patients with Bethlem myopathy, thus representing an excellent animal model for the study of this hereditary disease. Our findings demonstrate that Col6a1-/- mice have decreased plasma adiponectin content and diseased myoblasts have an impaired autocrine secretion of the hormone. Moreover, Col6a1-/- myoblasts show decreased glucose uptake and mitochondria with depolarized membrane potential and impaired functionality, as supported by decreased oxygen consumption. Exogenous addition of globular adiponectin modifies the features of Col6a1-/- myoblasts, becoming closer to that of the healthy myoblasts. Indeed, globular adiponectin enhances glucose uptake in Col6a1-/- myoblasts, modifies mitochondrial membrane potential, and restores oxygen consumption, turning closer to those of wild-type myoblasts. Finally, increase of plasma adiponectin level in Col6a1-/- mice is induced by fasting, a condition that has been previously shown to lead to the amelioration of the dystrophic phenotype. Collectively, our results demonstrate that exogenous replenishment of adiponectin reverses metabolic abnormalities observed in Col6a1-/- myoblasts. KEY MESSAGES: Col6a1-/- mice have decreased level of plasma adiponectin. Myoblasts from Col6a1-/- muscles have impaired local adiponectin secretion. Col6a1-/- myoblasts reveal altered metabolic features.

Furthermore, little is known about the mechanism involved in CD73 regulation in tumors. Here, we found that CD73 expression was upregulated in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and that its expression correlated with poor prognosis. CD73 knockdown inhibited cell growth and induced G1 phase arrest via the AKT/ERK/cyclin D signaling pathway. We also found that tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) 2 was involved in CD73-induced AKT and ERK signaling pathway activation in PDAC. Further, miR-30a-5p overexpression significantly increased the cytotoxic effect of gemcitabine in pancreatic cancer by directly targeting CD73 messenger RNA (mRNA), suggesting that regulation of the miR-30a-5p/CD73 axis may play an important role in the development of gemcitabine resistance in pancreatic cancer. In summary, this regulatory network of CD73 appears to represent a new molecular mechanism underlying PDAC progression, and the mechanistic interaction between miR-30a-5p, CD73, and TNFR2 may provide new insights into therapeutic strategies for pancreatic cancer. KEY MESSAGES: CD73 was upregulated in PDAC and correlated with poor prognosis. CD73 knockdown inhibited cell growth and induced G1 phase arrest. TNFR2 was involved in CD73-induced AKT and ERK signaling pathway. miR-30a-5p targeted CD73 and increased the sensitivity to gemcitabine.",Improved tactile frequency discrimination in musicians.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927044,Experimental brain research,2019 06 10,"Music practice is a multisensory training that is of great interest to neuroscientists because of its implications for neural plasticity. Music-related modulation of sensory systems has been observed in neuroimaging data, and has been supported by results in behavioral tasks. Some studies have shown that musicians react faster than non-musicians to visual, tactile and auditory stimuli. Behavioral enhancement in more complex tasks has received considerably less attention in musicians. This study aims to investigate unisensory and multisensory discrimination capabilities in musicians. More specifically, the goal of this study is to examine auditory, tactile and auditory-tactile discrimination in musicians. The literature suggesting better auditory and auditory-tactile discrimination in musicians is scarce, and no study to date has examined pure tactile discrimination capabilities in musicians. A two-alternative forced-choice frequency discrimination task was used in this experiment. The task was inspired by musical production, and participants were asked to identify whether a frequency was the same as or different than a standard stimulus of 160 Hz in three conditions: auditory only, auditory-tactile only and tactile only. Three waveforms were used to replicate the variability of pitch that can be found in music. Stimuli were presented through headphones for auditory stimulation and a glove with haptic audio exciters for tactile stimulation. Results suggest that musicians have lower discrimination thresholds than non-musicians for auditory-only and auditory-tactile conditions for all waveforms. The results also revealed that musicians have lower discrimination thresholds than non-musicians in the tactile condition for sine and square waveforms. Taken together, these results support the hypothesis that musical training can lead to better unisensory tactile discrimination which is in itself a new and major finding.","Neurophysiological, neuropsychological, and cognitive effects of 30 days of isolation.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927043,Experimental brain research,2019 06 10,"The increasing demand of space flights requires a profound knowledge of the chronologic reactions of the human body to extreme conditions. Prior studies already have shown the adverse effects of long-term isolation on psycho-physiological well-being. The chronology of the effects and whether short-term isolation periods already lead to similar effects has not been investigated. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to investigate the effects of short-term isolation (30 days) on mood, cognition, cortisol, neurotrophic factors, and brain activity. 16 participants were isolated in the Human Exploration Research Analog at NASA for 30 days. 17 non-isolated control participants were tested simultaneously. On mission days - 5, 7, 14, 28, and + 5, multiple tests including the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule-X and cognitive tests were conducted, and a 5-min resting electroencephalography was recorded. A fasted morning blood drawing was also done. Increased stress was observed via augmented cortisol levels during the isolation period. Activity within the parietal cortex was reduced over time, probably representing a neural adaptation to less external stimuli. Cognitive performance was not affected, but rather enhanced in both groups. No further significant changes in neurotrophic factors BDNF/IGF-1 and mood could be detected.

Here, we report that platform chemical 3-hydroxypropionic acid (3-HP) can be overproduced through promoter engineering and growth-sustaining cultivation, two parallel strategies relying on RNA polymerases (RNAPs). First, we screened a promoter library and revealed that IPTG-inducible tac promoter was most effective for overexpression of PuuC, an endogenous aldehyde dehydrogenase catalyzing 3-HP biosynthesis in Klebsiella pneumoniae. Next, tandem repetitive tac promoters were harnessed to accommodate adequate RNAPs. When three tandem repetitive tac promoters were recruited to overexpress PuuC, up to 102.61 g/L 3-HP was produced. This is the highest 3-HP titer reported so far. In addition, lactic acid completely vanished during the late stage of fermentation. The backflow of lactic acid to pyruvic acid saves the trouble of downstream separation of lactic acid from 3-HP, which has long been a mission impossible because they are small-molecule isomers. Furthermore, timely removal of acid stress and replenishment of nitrogen source are crucial for 3-HP biosynthesis. A mathematical model shows that RNAPs modulate the tradeoff between bacterial growth and 3-HP formation. Overall, promoter engineering and growth-promoting cultivation jointly leverage RNAPs to maximize 3-HP. This study provides a paradigm for maximizing growth-coupled metabolites.",Exploring new landmarks: analysis of Twitter usage during the 41st ESNR Annual Meeting.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927023,Neuroradiology,2019 04 29,"We analyzed the use of Twitter during the 41st Annual Meeting of the European Society of Neuroradiology (ESNR) held in Rotterdam from 19 to 23 September 2018.

Multiple cell environment effects (electrolyte effect, excluded volume effect, NPC drag effect, and hydrophobic effect) are all considered in this hairy channel model. The influence of various parameters (polymer chain length, length of NPC, strength of hydrophobic effect, and excluded volume effect) on translocation time is studied through theoretical analysis and numerical calculation. Numerical simulation results show that an area of low nucleoporin number density exists in the NPC, which facilitates the translocation of the polymer. The results also show that the translocation time curves with increasing NPC length and polymer charge number are concave. In addition, there are critical values for NPC length and polymer charge number for which the translocation time has a minimal value. The translocation time decreases with the increasing strength of the hydrophobic effect and excluded volume effect.","Toxic Effects of Selected Textile Dyes on Elemental Composition, Photosynthetic Pigments, Protein Content and Growth of a Freshwater Chlorophycean Alga Chlorella vulgaris.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927019,Bulletin of environmental contamination and toxicology,2019 05 30,"Toxicity of three textile dyes-Optilan yellow, Drimarene blue and Lanasyn brown, was evaluated in a green alga Chlorella vulgaris.

An epigenetic regulator, Additional sex combs-like 1 (ASXL1), is one of the most frequently mutated genes in all subtypes of myeloid malignancies. ASXL1 mutations are also frequently detected in clonal hematopoiesis, which is associated with an increased risk of mortality. Therefore, it is important to understand how ASXL1 mutations contribute to clonal expansion and myeloid transformation in hematopoietic cells. Studies using ASXL1-depleted human hematopoietic cells and Asxl1 knockout mice have shown that deletion of wild-type ASXL1 protein leads to impaired hematopoiesis and accelerates myeloid malignancies via loss of interaction with polycomb repressive complex 2 proteins. On the other hand, ASXL1 mutations in myeloid neoplasms typically occur near the last exon and result in the expression of C-terminally truncated mutant ASXL1 protein. Biological studies and biochemical analyses of this variant have shed light on its dominant-negative and gain-of-function features in myeloid transformation via a variety of epigenetic changes. Based on these results, it would be possible to establish novel promising therapeutic strategies for myeloid malignancies harboring ASXL1 mutations by blocking interactions between ASXL1 and associating epigenetic regulators. Here, we summarize the clinical implications of ASXL1 mutations, the role of wild-type ASXL1 in normal hematopoiesis, and oncogenic functions of mutant ASXL1 in myeloid neoplasms.",Cdc14 activation requires coordinated Cdk1-dependent phosphorylation of Net1 and PP2A-Cdc55 at anaphase onset.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927017,Cellular and molecular life sciences : CMLS,2019 03 30,"Exit from mitosis and completion of cytokinesis require the inactivation of mitotic cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) activity. In budding yeast, Cdc14 phosphatase is a key mitotic regulator that is activated in anaphase to counteract Cdk activity. In metaphase, Cdc14 is kept inactive in the nucleolus, where it is sequestered by its inhibitor, Net1. At anaphase onset, downregulation of PP2ACdc55 phosphatase by separase and Zds1 protein promotes Net1 phosphorylation and, consequently, Cdc14 release from the nucleolus. The mechanism by which PP2ACdc55 activity is downregulated during anaphase remains to be elucidated. Here, we demonstrate that Cdc55 regulatory subunit is phosphorylated in anaphase in a Cdk1-Clb2-dependent manner. Interestingly, cdc55-ED phosphomimetic mutant inactivates PP2ACdc55 phosphatase activity towards Net1 and promotes Cdc14 activation. Separase and Zds1 facilitate Cdk-dependent Net1 phosphorylation and Cdc14 release from the nucleolus by modulating PP2ACdc55 activity via Cdc55 phosphorylation. In addition, human Cdk1-CyclinB1 phosphorylates human B55, indicating that the mechanism is conserved in higher eukaryotes."

We have previously introduced a microplate-based ChIP platform, Matrix ChIP, where the entire ChIP procedure is done on the same plate without sample transfers. Compared to conventional ChIP protocols, the Matrix ChIP assay is faster and has increased throughput. However, even with microplate ChIP assays, sample preparation and chromatin fragmentation (which is required to map genomic locations) remains a major bottleneck. We have developed a novel technology (termed 'PIXUL') utilizing an array of ultrasound transducers for simultaneous shearing of samples in standard 96-well microplates. We integrated PIXUL with Matrix ChIP ('PIXUL-ChIP'), that allows for fast, reproducible, low-cost and high-throughput sample preparation and ChIP analysis of 96 samples (cell culture or tissues) in one day. Further, we demonstrated that chromatin prepared using PIXUL can be used in an existing ChIP-seq workflow. Thus, the high-throughput capacity of PIXUL-ChIP provides the means to carry out ChIP-qPCR or ChIP-seq experiments involving dozens of samples.

Recent years have seen the entrance of novel synthetic opioids (NSO) on the market, compounding the fatal intoxications issue. This brings several challenges for forensic toxicology laboratories: an increased number of cases, a large number of novel structurally similar compounds to include in screening analytical methods, the low concentration of drugs in biological fluids, and the challenging interpretation in the absence of sufficient literature. Three cases of fatal intoxication highlighting those challenges are presented, complete with post-mortem concentrations in cardiac blood, femoral blood and urine. Toxicological screening and quantitative analyses were performed on the biological specimens. In the first and second cases, furanylfentanyl, U-47700 and 4-anilino-N-phenethylpiperidine (4-ANPP) were detected at similar concentrations in cardiac blood. In the third case, a total of seventeen different NSO were detected. All intoxications showed a combination of NSO and other drugs.

To address this, we developed the anota2seq algorithm which outperforms current methods for statistical identification of changes in translation. Notably, in contrast to available analytical methods, anota2seq also allows specific identification of an underappreciated mode of gene expression regulation whereby translation acts as a buffering mechanism which maintains protein levels despite fluctuations in corresponding mRNA abundance ('translational buffering'). Thus, the universal anota2seq algorithm allows efficient and hitherto unprecedented interrogation of translatomes which is anticipated to advance knowledge regarding the role of translation in homeostasis and disease.","Determination of Tartrazine, Lutein, Capsanthin, Canthaxanthin and β-Carotene in Animal-Derived Foods and Feeds by HPLC Method.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30926998,Journal of chromatographic science,2019 03 30,"Pigments are still widely used in food and feed industry and their resides in food might be harmful to human health due to their side effects.

In the area of human medicine, the mis- and overuse of antibiotics is an important contributor to the development of AMR. Such a non-prudent use of antibiotics is especially prevalent in the treatment of viral infections such as the common cold. The present study aims to address the misconception, also known as outcome bias, that antibiotics may be an effective treatment against the common cold by providing a ""debiasing"" risk communication intervention. It aims at conveying the non-existence of a cause-effect relationship between antibiotics and the reduction of cold-related symptoms through a visual aid and simple explanatory text. A Solomon four-group design was employed to test for within- and between-subjects effects of the intervention as well as potential sensitization effects of the repeated measurement. A total of 311 participants residing in Germany were randomly assigned to receiving (1) a pretest, the debiasing intervention and post-test (2), a pretest, a control stimulus and post-test (3), the debiasing intervention and post-test, or (4) the post-test only. Outcome measures included knowledge about the effectiveness of antibiotics, the attitude toward using it as treatment against the common cold and the evaluation of a scenario describing an irresponsible use of antibiotics. Within-subjects comparisons found that participants receiving the pre- and post-test and intervention showed improved knowledge (t(77) = -2.53, p = .014), attitude (t(77) = -2.09, p = .040), and evaluation measures (t(77) = -2.23, p = .028). The pretest might, however, have caused a sensitization of participants for knowledge-related questions (t(77) = 2.207, p = .029). Between-subjects comparisons found differences in knowledge levels between the post-test only group and both groups receiving the intervention (F(3, 307) = 5.63, p = .001, η2p = .05]. There were no differences between the intervention and control groups with regard to attitude and evaluation of the scenario. While the risk communication intervention led to an increase in knowledge, the outcomes related to attitude and evaluation of a scenario were only affected positively in one group. Therefore, it seems that communication interventions based on visual aids are a simple method to promote the understanding of the true relationship between antibiotic treatment and the decrease of cold-related symptoms. Variables such as attitude and evaluation of a scenario presenting the irresponsible use of antibiotics require, however, additional interventions facilitating a translation of accurate understanding into respective attitudes and judgments.",Replication dynamics of individual loci in single living cells reveal changes in the degree of replication stochasticity through S phase.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30926993,Nucleic acids research,2019 06 14,"Eukaryotic genomes are replicated under the control of a highly sophisticated program during the restricted time period corresponding to S phase. The most widely used replication timing assays, which are performed on populations of millions of cells, suggest that most of the genome is synchronously replicated on homologous chromosomes. We investigated the stochastic nature of this temporal program, by comparing the precise replication times of allelic loci within single vertebrate cells progressing through S phase at six loci replicated from very early to very late. We show that replication timing is strictly controlled for the three loci replicated in the first half of S phase. Out of the three loci replicated in the second part of S phase, two present a significantly more stochastic pattern. Surprisingly, we find that the locus replicated at the very end of S phase, presents stochasticity similar to those replicated in early S phase. We suggest that the richness of loci in efficient origins of replication, which decreases from early- to late-replicating regions, and the strength of interaction with the nuclear lamina may underlie the variation of timing control during S phase."

We introduce a probabilistic framework that models correlation among transcriptome-wide association study signals to assign a probability for every gene in the risk region to explain the observed association signal. Importantly, our approach remains accurate when expression data for causal genes are not available in the causal tissue by leveraging expression prediction from other tissues.

We explore risk loci where TWAS accurately prioritizes the likely causal gene as well as loci where TWAS prioritizes multiple genes, some likely to be non-causal, owing to sharing of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL). TWAS is especially prone to spurious prioritization with expression data from non-trait-related tissues or cell types, owing to substantial cross-cell-type variation in expression levels and eQTL strengths.

This model is potentially useful as a platform for refining anti-LC therapies.",Safe and neuroprotective vectors for long-term traumatic brain injury gene therapy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30926962,Gene therapy,2019 03 30,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a complex and progressive brain injury with no approved treatments that needs both short- and long-term therapeutic strategies to cope with the variety of physiopathological mechanisms involved. In particular, neuroinflammation is a key process modulating TBI outcome, and the potentiation of these mechanisms by pro-inflammatory gene therapy vectors could contribute to the injury progression. Here, we evaluate in the controlled cortical impact model of TBI, the safety of integrative-deficient lentiviral vectors (IDLVs) or the non-viral HNRK recombinant modular protein/DNA nanovector. These two promising vectors display different tropisms, transduction efficiencies, short- or long-term transduction or inflammatory activation profile. We show that the brain intraparenchymal injection of these vectors overexpressing green fluorescent protein after a CCI is not neurotoxic, and interestingly, can decrease the short-term sensory neurological deficits, and diminish the brain tissue loss at 90 days post lesion (dpl). Moreover, only IDLVs were able to mitigate the memory deficits elicited by a CCI. These vectors did not alter the microglial or astroglial reactivity at 90 dpl, suggesting that they do not potentiate the on-going neuroinflammation. Taken together, these data suggest that both types of vectors could be interesting tools for the design of gene therapy strategies targeting immediate or long-term neuropathological mechanisms of TBI.",Stability of the adeno-associated virus 8 reference standard material.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30926961,Gene therapy,2019 05 24,"Adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors are extensively used for gene therapy clinical trials. Accurate and standardized titration methods are essential for characterizing and dosing AAV-based drugs and thus to assess their safety and efficacy. To this end, the Reference Standard Materials (RSM) working group generated standards for AAV serotype 2 and serotype 8. The AAV8RSM (ATCC® VR-1816™) was deposited to the American Type Culture Collection in 2014 and is available to the scientific community. Here, three independent laboratories of the RSM working group provide stability data of the AAV8RSM 2 years after the initial characterization and after container relabeling performed at the ATCC. The AAV8RSM showed constant titers across experimental conditions: 1.48 ± 0.62 × 1012 vector genome (vg)/ml, 9.38 ± 11.4 × 108 infectious units (IU)/ml and 5.76 ± 2.39 × 1011 total particles (p)/ml as determined by qPCR, TCID50 and ELISA, respectively. Additionally, the AAV8RSM capsid protein integrity assessed by SDS-PAGE was equivalent to the original analyses. In conclusion, the AAV8RSM titers remained stable for two years under appropriate storage conditions ( <-70° C). The use of RSM is strongly recommended and endorsed by regulatory agencies to normalize laboratory internal controls and to provide accurate titration of AAV vectors lots.",Combination of cabazitaxel and p53 gene therapy abolishes prostate carcinoma tumor growth.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30926960,Gene therapy,2019 03 30,"For patients with metastatic prostate cancer, the 5-year survival rate of 31% points to a need for novel therapies and improvement of existing modalities. We propose that p53 gene therapy and chemotherapy, when combined, will provide superior tumor cell killing for the treatment of prostate carcinoma. To this end, we have developed the AdRGD-PGp53 vector which offers autoregulated expression of p53, resulting in enhanced tumor cell killing in vitro and in vivo. Here, we combined AdRGD-PGp53 along with the chemotherapy drugs used in the clinical treatment of prostate carcinoma, mitoxantrone, docetaxel, or cabazitaxel. Our results indicate that all drugs increase phosphorylation of p53, leading to improved induction of p53 targets. In vitro experiments reveal that AdRGD-PGp53 sensitizes prostate cancer cells to each of the drugs tested, conferring increased levels of cell death. In a xenograft mouse model of in situ gene therapy, AdRGD-PGp53 treatment, when combined with cabazitaxel, drastically reduced tumor progression and increased survival rates to 100%. Strikingly, we used a sub-therapeutic dose of cabazitaxel thus avoiding leukopenia, yet still showed potent anti-tumor effects when combined with AdRGD-PGp53 in this mouse model. The AdRGD-PGp53 approach warrants further development for its application in gene therapy of prostate carcinoma."

However, the association of the combination of aortic arch calcification (AoAC) and cardio-thoracic ratio (CTR) with clinical outcomes in patients with CKD is not well investigated. This study investigated whether the combination of AoAC and CTR is associated with poor clinical outcomes in CKD stages 3-5 patients. We enrolled 568 CKD patients, and AoAC and CTR were determined by chest radiography at enrollment. Rapid renal progression was defined as estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) decline over 3 ml/min/1.73 m2 per year. Both AoAC score and CTR were significantly associated with rapid renal progression. High CTR was correlated with increased risk for cardiovascular mortality. We stratified the patients into four groups according to the median AoAC score of 4 and CTR of 50%. Those with AoAC ≥ 4 and CTR ≥ 50% (vs. AoAC score < 4 and CTR < 50%) were associated with eGFR decline over 3 ml/min/1.73 m2/year and cardiovascular mortality. AoAC and CTR were independently associated with eGFR slope. In conclusion, the combination of increased AoAC and cardiomegaly was associated with rapid renal progression and increased cardiovascular mortality in patients with CKD stage 3-5 patients. We suggest that evaluating AoAC and CTR on chest plain radiography may be a simple and inexpensive method for detecting CKD patients at high risk for adverse clinical outcomes.",Runoff events and related rainfall variability in the Southern Carpathians during the last 2000 years.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30926945,Scientific reports,2019 04 06,"The occurrence of heavy rainfall events is expected to undergo significant changes under increasing anthropogenic forcing. South-eastern Europe is reacting rapidly to such changes, therefore understanding and forecasting of precipitation variability is vital to better comprehending environmental changes in this area. Here we present a sub-decadal reconstruction of enhanced rainfall events for the past 2000 years from the Southern Carpathians, Romania using peat geochemistry. Five clear periods of enhanced rainfall are identified at 125-250, 600-900, 1050-1300, 1400-1575 and 1725-1980 CE. Significant runoff is observed during the second half of the Medieval Warm Period, whilst the Little Ice Age was characterised by significant variability. The North Atlantic Oscillation appears to be the main control on regional precipitation, but changes in solar irradiance also seem to play a significant role, together with the Siberian High. Comparison of the data presented here with model outputs confirms the ability of models to predict general trends, and major shifts, but highlights the complexity of the region's hydrological history.","Heterogeneous drug tissue binding in brain regions of rats, Alzheimer's patients and controls: impact on translational drug development.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30926941,Scientific reports,2019 04 06,"For preclinical and clinical assessment of therapeutically relevant unbound, free, brain concentrations, the pharmacokinetic parameter fraction of unbound drug in brain (fu,brain) is commonly used to compensate total drug concentrations for nonspecific brain tissue binding (BTB). As, homogenous BTB is assumed between species and in health and disease, rat BTB is routinely used. The impact of Alzheimer's disease (AD) on drug BTB in brain regions of interest (ROI), i.e., fu,brain,ROI, is yet unclear. This study for the first time provides insight into regional drug BTB and the validity of employing rat fu,brain,ROI as a surrogate of human BTB, by investigating five marketed drugs in post-mortem tissue from AD patients (n = 6) and age-matched controls (n = 6). Heterogeneous drug BTB was observed in all within group comparisons independent of disease and species. The findings oppose the assumption of uniform BTB, highlighting the need of case-by-case evaluation of fu,brain,ROI in translational CNS research.",Novel combination of feed enzymes to improve the degradation of Chlorella vulgaris recalcitrant cell wall.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30926940,Scientific reports,2019 04 06,"In this study, a rational combination of 200 pre-selected Carbohydrate-Active enzymes (CAZymes) and sulfatases were tested, individually or combined, according to their ability to degrade Chlorella vulgaris cell wall to access its valuable nutritional compounds. The disruption of microalgae cell walls by a four-enzyme mixture (Mix) in comparison with the control, enabled to release up to 1.21 g/L of reducing sugars (p < 0.001), led to an eight-fold increase in oligosaccharides release (p < 0.001), and reduced the fluorescence intensity by 47% after staining with Calcofluor White (p < 0.001). The Mix treatment was successful in releasing proteins (p < 0.001), some MUFA (p < 0.05), and the beneficial 18:3n-3 fatty acid (p < 0.05). Even if no variation was detected for chlorophylls (p > 0.05), total carotenoids were increased in the supernatant (p < 0.05) from the Mix treatment, relative to the control. Taken together, these results indicate that this four-enzyme Mix displays an effective capacity to degrade C. vulgaris cell wall. Thus, these enzymes may constitute a good approach to improve the bioavailability of C. vulgaris nutrients for monogastric diets, in particular, and to facilitate the cost-effective use of microalgae by the feed industry, in general.",Extremely Large Magnetic-Field-Effects on the Impedance Response of TiO2 Quantum Dots.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30926939,Scientific reports,2019 04 06,"Here, we report large magnetoresistance and magnetocapacitance response of undoped TiO2 quantum dots weighting the contribution of both grain and grain boundaries by means of impedance spectroscopy. We also performed a complete characterization of the TiO2 quantum dots (~5 nm) prepared by sol-gel via water vapor diffusion method, using X-ray diffraction, small angle X-ray scattering, transmission electron microscopy and Raman spectroscopy. In addition, we showed a complete theoretical study on the electronic properties of TiO2 surface and subsurface oxygen and titanium vacancies to shed some light in their electronic and magnetic properties. Based in our study, we can conclude that the presence of defects, mainly at the grain boundary of these undoped TiO2 quantum dots, could be responsible for the large positive magnetoresistance (+1200%) and negative magnetocapacitance (-115%) responses at low applied magnetic fields (1.8 kOe) and room temperature.","Transcriptomic analysis of the prothoracic gland from two lepidopteran insects, domesticated silkmoth Bombyx mori and wild silkmoth Antheraea pernyi.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30926938,Scientific reports,2019 04 06,"The prothoracic gland (PG) is an important endocrine organ of synthesis and secretion of ecdysteroids that play critical roles in insects. Here, we used a comparative transcriptomic approach to characterize some common features of PGs from two lepidopteran species Bombyx mori and Antheraea pernyi. Functional and pathway annotations revealed an overall similarity in gene profile between the two PG transcriptomes. As expected, almost all steroid hormone biosynthesis genes and the prothoracicitropic hormone receptor gene (Torso) were well represented in the two PGs. Impressively, two ecdysone receptor genes, eleven juvenile hormone related genes, more than 10 chemosensory protein genes, and a set of genes involved in circadian clock were also presented in the two PGs. Quantitative real time -PCR (qRT-PCR) validated the expression of 8 juvenile hormone and 12 clock related genes in B. mori PG, and revealed a different expression pattern during development in whole fifth larval instar. This contribution to insect PG transcriptome data will extend our understanding of the function and regulation of this important organ.",Uncertainty in ensembles of global biodiversity scenarios.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30926936,Nature communications,2019 05 03,"While there is a clear demand for scenarios that provide alternative states in biodiversity with respect to future emissions, a thorough analysis and communication of the associated uncertainties is still missing. Here, we modelled the global distribution of ~11,500 amphibian, bird and mammal species and project their climatic suitability into the time horizon 2050 and 2070, while varying the input data used. By this, we explore the uncertainties originating from selecting species distribution models (SDMs), dispersal strategies, global circulation models (GCMs), and representative concentration pathways (RCPs). We demonstrate the overwhelming influence of SDMs and RCPs on future biodiversity projections, followed by dispersal strategies and GCMs. The relative importance of each component varies in space but also with the selected sensitivity metrics and with species' range size. Overall, this means using multiple SDMs, RCPs, dispersal assumptions and GCMs is a necessity in any biodiversity scenario assessment, to explicitly report associated uncertainties.",Computer aided protein engineering to enhance the thermo-stability of CXCR1- T4 lysozyme complex.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30926935,Scientific reports,2019 04 06,"CXCR1, a member in G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) family, binds to chemokine interleukin-8 (IL-8) specifically and transduces signals to mediate immune and inflammatory responses. Despite the importance of CXCR1, high-resolution structure determination is hindered by the challenges in crystallization. It has been shown that properly designed mutants with enhanced thermostability, together with fusion partner proteins, can be useful to form crystals for GPCR proteins. In this study, in silico protein design was carried out by using homology modeling and molecular dynamics simulations. To validate the computational modeling results, the thermostability of several mutants and the wild type were measured experimentally. Both computational results and experimental data suggest that the mutant L126W has a significant improvement in the thermostability. This study demonstrated that in silico design can guide protein engineering and potentially facilitate protein crystallography research.",Calf aversion to hot-iron disbudding.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30926934,Scientific reports,2019 04 06,"Dairy calves are routinely disbudded by cauterization with a hot iron. To mitigate the intra-operative and initial post-operative pain associated with this procedure some farmers provide calves general and local anesthetics, but it is unknown if the procedure remains aversive. We used a place-conditioning paradigm to assess aversion caused by hot-iron cautery with a local anesthetic compared to a sham procedure. A test area was divided into three equally sized pens: two 'treatment' pens with distinct visual cues were connected by a central 'neutral' pen. Each calf went through the disbudding procedure and a 6-h recovery period in one treatment pen and the control procedure in the other treatment pen. In three tests (48, 72 and 96 h after the second treatment), calves could freely roam among the pens until they chose to lie down, ending the session. Calves spent less time in either of the treatment pens compared to the central pen. When only comparing the two treatment pen, calves spent less time in the disbudding pen, especially during the first test. Calves were also less likely to lie down in the pen associated with the disbudding procedure. We conclude that even with the use of a local anesthetic, hot-iron disbudding is salient and aversive for calves, indicating the need to refine or avoid the procedure."

Here, the effects of low temperature storage on quality of C. pallens were investigated by storing cocoons at 10 °C for different days. Results revealed, after removal from cold storage, emergence rate declined gradually as storage duration increased. After storage of 20 days, the emergence rate in cold-stored group is about 62.8% of that in unstored group. After eclosion, lifetime fecundity, preemergence period, oviposition period and longevity of adults in cold-stored group showed curves similar to emergence rate. However, preoviposition period and egg hatchability were not significantly affected by cold. After being stored for 20 days, the total fecundity of females emerging from cold-stored cocoons was about 64.5% of that of females emerging from unstored cocoons. Six days post emergence, females in cold-stored group showed apparent arrest of ovarian development and significant reductions of protease, lipase and trehalase activities when compared to unstored controls. When bovine insulin was exogenously used, the females emerging from cold-stored cocoons dramatically restored ovarian development and reproductive capacity. These results suggested that C. pallens pupae are suitable for cold storage and insulin hormone can be used as reproduction stimuli in this predatory species after cold storage.",Genome organization in immune cells: unique challenges.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30926914,Nature reviews.

We report the spatial patterns of macro-litter distribution within the Messina Strait's channels (Central Mediterranean), focusing on the transfer mechanisms responsible for its emplacement, a key information to better understand litter distribution. Litter is patchy but pervasive on all surveyed channels, reaching densities up to ~200 items/10 m, the highest reported for the deep sea until now. Litter is often arranged in large accumulations formed by hundreds of land-sourced items, mixed to vegetal and coarse-grained debris, indicating an emplacement from sedimentary gravity flows. Such impressive amount of litter can be explained by the superposition of a very efficient source-to-sink sedimentary transport and a strong urbanization of the coastal area. These findings point out that macro-benthic litter pollution is a major, often overlooked, threat for deep-sea ecosystems. Further explorations are thus required in similar marine settings to fully understand the magnitude of the problem, since they may represent the largest litter hotspots in the deep-sea.",Peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer and ganglion cell complex degeneration in Egyptian patients with bipolar disorder.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30926912,"Eye (London, England)",2019 06 04,"To determine if changes in OCT parameters including peripapillary RNFL thickness and GCC thickness in Egyptian patients with bipolar disorder exist, and to correlate them with disease severity and clinical characteristics.",Optical coherence tomography evidence of macular ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer thinning in eyes with subretinal drusenoid deposits.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30926911,"Eye (London, England)",2019 03 30,The purpose of this study was to evaluate macular ganglion cell layer-inner plexiform layer (GCL-IPL) and choroidal thickness in early age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in eyes with subretinal drusenoid deposits (SDD).,Protein kinase CK2-dependent aerobic glycolysis-induced lactate dehydrogenase A enhances the migration and invasion of cancer cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30926903,Scientific reports,2019 04 06,"We investigated the intracellular metabolic fluxes of protein kinase CK2-activating (Cα OE) cells and role of lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) as a contributor of tumorigenesis after reprogrammed glucose metabolism. Facilitated aerobic glycolysis was confirmed via isotope tracer analysis, in which 13C6-Glc or 13C5-Gln was added to the media, following which metabolites converted from Cα OE cells were identified. We found a greater decrease in cell survival, colony-forming ability, migration, and Cα OE cell invasion under glucose (Glc)-depletion conditions than under glutamine (Gln)-depletion conditions. Cancer cell migration and invasion increased due to LDHA elevation of the altered metabolic axis driven by activated CK2. FX11 treatment and LDHA knockdown suppressed migration and invasion through ROS generation, but this was partially reversed by the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC). Moreover, LDHA inhibition decreased tumor growth in a mouse xenograft model transplanted with Cα OE cells. Finally, we concluded that LDHA is an excellent metabolic target for tumor therapy, based on CK2α derived aerobic glycolysis.",Leukocyte matrix metalloproteinase and tissue inhibitor gene expression patterns in children with primary hypertension.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30926902,Journal of human hypertension,2019 03 30,"Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their tissue inhibitors (TIMPs) play an important role in cardiovascular remodeling.

The aim of this study was to explore disturbances in global and local synchrony patterns between brain regions in the APP/PS1 mouse model of the AD during natural sleep. We used 8 male APPswe/PS1dE9 mice and 6 wild-type littermates, aged 5-6 months, with multiple electrode bundles implanted into cortical regions, thalamus and hippocampus. We measured video-EEG in freely moving animals and analyzed synchrony during NREM vs REM sleep. Global synchrony between medial frontal cortex and hippocampus measured with magnitude-squared coherence was slightly decreased in delta range during NREM stage of sleep in APP/PS1 mice. In contrast, local hippocampal synchrony measured with cross-frequency coupling remained intact. Ripple structure or frequency did not differ between the genotypes. However, the coupling of the spindle-band power peak in the medial prefrontal cortex to hippocampal ripples was significantly decreased compared to wild-type animals. The delicate timing of hippocampal ripples, frontal delta, and corticothalamic spindle oscillations may be the first sign of impaired memory in amyloid plaque-forming transgenic mice.",Shp-2 is critical for ERK and metabolic engagement downstream of IL-15 receptor in NK cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30926899,Nature communications,2019 05 03,"The phosphatase Shp-2 was implicated in NK cell development and functions due to its interaction with NK inhibitory receptors, but its exact role in NK cells is still unclear. Here we show, using mice conditionally deficient for Shp-2 in the NK lineage, that NK cell development and responsiveness are largely unaffected. Instead, we find that Shp-2 serves mainly to enforce NK cell responses to activation by IL-15 and IL-2. Shp-2-deficient NK cells have reduced proliferation and survival when treated with high dose IL-15 or IL-2. Mechanistically, Shp-2 deficiency hampers acute IL-15 stimulation-induced raise in glycolytic and respiration rates, and causes a dramatic defect in ERK activation. Moreover, inhibition of the ERK and mTOR cascades largely phenocopies the defect observed in the absence of Shp-2. Together, our data reveal a critical function of Shp-2 as a molecular nexus bridging acute IL-15 signaling with downstream metabolic burst and NK cell expansion.",Near-infrared tunable metalens based on phase change material Ge2Se2Te5.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30926898,Scientific reports,2019 04 06,"Metasurfaces draw everyone's attention because they can precisely control the phase, amplitude and polarization of emergent light to achieve light field control in recent years. As one of the most practicable devices among the many applications of metasurface, metalens can extremely reduce the size as well as complexity of optical systems and realizes the higher optical quality compared with conventional lens. So it will be very potential to use metalens in integration systems to reaching higher integration and efficiency. In addition, dynamic control is always desirable in optical systems. In this work, we firstly design a near-infrared tunable metalens treating phase change materials as the meta-atoms which makes the tunable metalens become more compact. At designed wavelength of 1.55 μm, the focusing efficiency of our amorphous metalens is more than 16 times of the efficiency when it works at crystalline state, and its focal length can stay almost unchanged when the GST state is switched. The broadband performance of the metalens is also confirmed. This work may bring some good opportunities for the revolution of the next generation tunable integrated optics."

However, it is difficult to discriminate between surface and bulk recombination and consequently the bulk properties of the semiconductor cannot be estimated reliably. Here we present an approach to constrain systematically the bulk and surface recombination parameters in semiconducting layers and reduces to finding the roots of a mathematical function. This method disentangles the bulk and surface recombination based on TRPL decay times of samples with different surface preparations. The technique is exemplarily applied to a CuInSe2 and a back-graded Cu(In,Ga)Se2 compound semiconductor, and upper and lower bounds for the recombination parameters and the mobility are obtained. Sets of calculated parameters are extracted and used as input for simulations of photoluminescence transients, yielding a good match to experimental data and validating the effectiveness of the methodology. A script for the simulation of TRPL transients is provided.",Simulation of tight fluid flow with the consideration of capillarity and stress-change effect.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30926884,Scientific reports,2019 04 06,"The horizontal wells and multi-stage hydraulic fracturing technologies play a significantly important role in developing unconventional reservoirs. Due to the nanopore effects and stress deformation in tight formations, the fluid equilibrium and thermodynamics become more complex and the conventional reservoir simulation models cannot accurately handle these mechanisms. Hence, the objective of this work is to propose a comprehensive simulation model considering the effects of confined space and stress-dependent deformation. We first evaluated the phase envelope and fluid properties in the confined nanopores. Results show that bubble-point pressure and oil viscosity decrease, while formation volume factor and gas-oil ratio increase. The heavy components cause large deviation on the P-T phase envelope at the reservoir condition. Subsequently, a reservoir simulation model of the Bakken tight oil reservoir was built including the effect of stress-dependent deformation. The proposed phase behavior model was applied into the reservoir simulator to predict the hydrocarbon production from the Bakken tight oil reservoir. Finally, the role of the confined space and the stress-dependent deformation on the production are examined in detail. This novel simulation approach can shed light on the better understanding of the key parameters affecting well production of in developing tight oil reservoirs in the future.",Multifunctional Gold Nanoparticles Overcome MicroRNA Regulatory Network Mediated-Multidrug Resistant Leukemia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30926883,Scientific reports,2019 04 06,"Resistance to chemotherapy and molecularly targeted therapies is a major problem in current leukemia treatments. Here, we investigated cross-talk between the miR-221 network and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) in doxorubicin-induced drug resistance of leukemia cells. Multifunctional gold nanoparticles were designed and synthesized to co-deliver three anticancer agents, AS1411, doxorubicin and anti-221, for improving leukemia treatment efficacy. These nanoparticles significantly inhibited the proliferation and clonogenic potential, and induced apoptosis of drug-resistant leukemia cells. The decreased growth of drug-resistant cells induced by these nanoparticles was associated with marked downregulation of miR-221 and DNMT1, leading to restored p27kip1 and p15ink4b tumor suppressor expression, as well as miR-221-mediated reduction of P-gp expression. Finally, primary blasts derived from leukemia patients experiencing chemoresistant relapse that were exposed to these nanoparticles were sensitized to doxorubicin, as evidenced by suppression of leukemic cell growth and a significant reduction of the doxorubicin IC50 value. Our findings provide proof of concept that this novel drug delivery system can precisely reverse the multidrug resistant leukemia phenotype based on preclinical models of leukemia, providing the framework for future clinical trials aimed at overcoming drug resistance and improving patient outcome.",TIM-3 in endometrial carcinomas: an immunotherapeutic target expressed by mismatch repair-deficient and intact cancers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30926882,"Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc",2019 03 30,"The checkpoint molecule TIM-3 is a target for emerging immunotherapies and has been identified on a variety of malignancies. Mismatch repair-deficient endometrial carcinomas have demonstrated durable responses to other checkpoint inhibitors due to high neoantigen loads and robust tumor-associated immune responses. However, little is known about TIM-3 expression in this tumor type. Tumor-associated immune and tumoral expression of TIM-3 were evaluated by immunohistochemistry on 75 endometrial carcinomas [25 MLH1 promoter hypermethylated (MLH1-hypermethylated), 25 non-hypermethylated mismatch repair-deficient, and 25 mismatch repair-intact]. All cases showed at least focal immune staining, but moderate and robust immune cell expression were more often observed in mismatch repair-deficient vs intact cases [66 vs 12%, P = 0.00002]. While the majority (77%) of endometrial cancers showed ≥1% tumoral TIM-3 expression, the MLH1-hypermethylated subset was more likely to demonstrate >5% tumoral staining when compared to both mismatch repair-intact and non-methylated mismatch repair-deficient cancers [64 vs. 28% and 32%, respectively; P = 0.02 and P = 0.05]. Within the non-methylated mismatch repair-deficient subset, high-level expression was most often associated with MSH6 loss. Across mismatch repair subgroups, tumoral TIM-3 expression was more common among intermediate and high-grade vs. low-grade tumors using both the 1% (P = 0.02) and 5% expression cut-offs (P = 0.02). In conclusion, tumoral TIM-3 expression is common in both mismatch repair-intact and deficient endometrial cancers, with particularly high levels of expression identified in the setting of MLH1-hypermethylation, MSH6 loss, and intermediate to high histologic grade. Although focal immune cell expression was seen in all tumors, robust expression was significantly more common in the context of mismatch repair deficiency. These data support a potential role for checkpoint inhibitors targeting TIM-3 in a subset of endometrial cancers, including some mismatch repair-intact tumors which are not currently considered immunotherapy candidates.",Streptolysin S induces mitochondrial damage and macrophage death through inhibiting degradation of glycogen synthase kinase-3β in Streptococcus pyogenes infection.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30926881,Scientific reports,2019 04 06,"Group A Streptococcus (GAS) infection is associated with a variety of human diseases. Previous studies indicate GAS infection leads to RAW264.7 cell death, but the mechanism is unclear. Here, analyzing the timing of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and using mitochondrial ROS scavenger, we found the wild type GAS-induced RAW264.7 cell death was associated with mitochondrial ROS. The wild type GAS infection could activate glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β). Inhibition of GSK-3β activity by lithium chloride or decreasing GSK-3β expression by lentivirus-mediated short hairpin RNA for GSK-3β could not only decrease the wild type GAS-induced mitochondrial ROS generation, mitochondria damage and cell death, but also reduced GAS intracellular replication. Streptolysin S (SLS), a GAS toxin, played the important role on GAS-induced macrophage death. Compared to the wild type GAS with its isogenic sagB mutant (SLS mutant)-infected macrophages, we found sagB mutant infection caused less mitochondrial ROS generation and cell death than those of the wild type GAS-infected ones. Furthermore, the sagB mutant, but not the wild type or the sagB-complementary mutant, could induce GSK-3β degradation via a proteasome-dependent pathway. These results suggest that a new mechanism of SLS-induced macrophage death was through inhibiting GSK-3β degradation and further enhancing mitochondrial damage.",Functional and structural similarities of D7 proteins in the independently-evolved salivary secretions of sand flies and mosquitoes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30926880,Scientific reports,2019 04 06,"The habit of blood feeding evolved independently in many insect orders of families. Sand flies and mosquitoes belong to separate lineages of blood-feeding Diptera and are thus considered to have evolved the trait independently. Because of this, sand fly salivary proteins differ structurally from those of mosquitoes, and orthologous groups are nearly impossible to define. An exception is the long-form D7-like proteins that show conservation with their mosquito counterparts of numerous residues associated with the N-terminal domain binding pocket. In mosquitoes, this pocket is responsible for the scavenging of proinflammatory cysteinyl leukotrienes and thromboxanes at the feeding site. Here we show that long-form D7 proteins AGE83092 and ABI15936 from the sand fly species, Phlebotomus papatasi and P. duboscqi, respectively, inhibit the activation of platelets by collagen and the thromboxane A2 analog U46619. Using isothermal titration calorimetry, we also demonstrate direct binding of U46619 and cysteinyl leukotrienes C4, D4 and E4 to the P. papatasi protein. The crystal structure of P. duboscqi ABI15936 was determined and found to contain two domains oriented similarly to those of the mosquito proteins. The N-terminal domain contains an apparent eicosanoid binding pocket. The C-terminal domain is smaller in overall size than in the mosquito D7s and is missing some helical elements. Consequently, it does not contain an obvious internal binding pocket for small-molecule ligands that bind to many mosquito D7s. Structural similarities indicate that mosquito and sand fly D7 proteins have evolved from similar progenitors, but phylogenetics and differences in intron/exon structure suggest that they may have acquired the ability to bind vertebrate eicosanoids independently, indicating a convergent evolution scenario.",Intense bone fluorescence reveals hidden patterns in pumpkin toadlets.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30926879,Scientific reports,2019 04 06,"The phenomenon of fluorescence can be used by animals to change effective colouration or patterning, potentially to serve functions including intra- and interspecific signalling. Initially believed to be restricted to marine animals, fluorescent colours are now being described in an increasing number of terrestrial species. Here, we describe unique, highly fluorescent patterns in two species of pumpkin toadlets (Brachycephalus ephippium and B. pitanga). We establish that the origin of the fluorescence lies in the dermal bone of the head and back, visible through a particularly thin skin. By comparing them to those of the closely related species Ischnocnema parva, we demonstrate that pumpkin toadlets' bones are exceptionally fluorescent. We characterize the luminescence properties of the toadlets' bones and discuss the potential function of fluorescent patterns in natural lighting conditions.",The anti-cancer drugs curaxins target spatial genome organization.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30926878,Nature communications,2019 05 03,"Recently we characterized a class of anti-cancer agents (curaxins) that disturbs DNA/histone interactions within nucleosomes. Here, using a combination of genomic and in vitro approaches, we demonstrate that curaxins strongly affect spatial genome organization and compromise enhancer-promoter communication, which is necessary for the expression of several oncogenes, including MYC. We further show that curaxins selectively inhibit enhancer-regulated transcription of chromatinized templates in cell-free conditions. Genomic studies also suggest that curaxins induce partial depletion of CTCF from its binding sites, which contributes to the observed changes in genome topology. Thus, curaxins can be classified as epigenetic drugs that target the 3D genome organization.",Genome-wide association analysis suggests novel loci underlying thyroid antibodies in Hashimoto's thyroiditis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30926877,Scientific reports,2019 04 06,"Thyroid antibodies against thyroglobulin (TgAb) and thyroid peroxidase (TPOAb) are key markers of Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT), the most common autoimmune thyroid disorder. Genetic determinants of thyroid antibodies are still poorly known, especially as they were not studied in patients with thyroid diseases. We performed the first genome-wide association analysis of thyroid antibodies in 430 HT patients that may be considered as population extremes for thyroid antibodies distribution. We detected two suggestively associated genetic variants with TgAb, rs6972286 close to ANKRD7 and LSM8 (P = 2.34 × 10-7) and rs756763 inside CA10 (P = 6.05 × 10-7), and one with TPOAb, rs12507813 positioned between TRIM61 and TRIM60 (P = 4.95 × 10-7). Bivariate analysis resulted with three suggestively associated genetic variants that predispose to both antibodies: rs13190616 inside RP11-138J23.1 (P = 2.01 × 10-6), rs561030786 close to DUBR (P = 7.33 × 10-6) and rs12713034 inside FSHR (P = 7.66 × 10-6). All identified genomic regions have a substantial literature record of involvement with female-related traits, immune-mediated diseases and personality traits that are all characterized by increased thyroid antibody levels. Our findings demonstrate the existence of genetic overlap between thyroid autoimmunity in HT and different non-thyroid diseases characterized by the presence of thyroid antibodies. We also suggest that genetic variants that regulate antibody levels may differ between HT patients and individuals with normal thyroid function.","Source, Spatial Distribution and Pollution Assessment of Pb, Zn, Cu, and Pb, Isotopes in urban soils of Ahvaz City, a semi-arid metropolis in southwest Iran.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30926876,Scientific reports,2019 04 06,"This study examined the status of toxic metal contamination of the urban industrial city of Ahvaz in Iran. Two hundred and twenty-seven surface soils from a depth horizon of 0-10 cm were collected from urban areas. In addition, 15 soil samples were collected to recognise the sources of Pb in urban topsoils in Ahvaz city. Mean concentration of Pb, Zn, Cu and As were 181 ± 167, 123 ± 118, 185 ± 167 and 6.9 ± 8.9 mg.kg-1, respectively. Results of inter-element relationship among studied toxic metals revealed that Pb, Zn and Cu may have the same anthropogenic origin, whilst As originated from different sources. The results of pollution index (PI) and Nemerow pollution index (NPI) implied that Pb, Zn, and Cu had a moderate to high level of pollution. The Pb isotopic composition analysis suggested clear anthropogenic origins of Pb including industrial emission, vehicle exhaust and dust storm with the mean contributions of 47%, 15% and 7%, respectively, by a four-end member model."

Both MRSA and MSSA strains produce powerful cytotoxins: alpha-hemolysin(Hla) and up to five leukocidins - LukSF-PV, HlgAB, HlgCB, LukED and LukGH (LukAB) - to evade host innate defense mechanisms. Neutralizing cytotoxins has been shown to provide survival benefit in rabbit S. aureus pneumonia models. We studied the mechanisms of protection of ASN100, a combination of two human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), ASN-1 and ASN-2, that together neutralize Hla and the five leukocidins, in rabbit MRSA and MSSA pneumonia models. Upon prophylactic passive immunization, ASN100 displayed dose-dependent increase in survival and was fully protective against all S. aureus strains tested at 5 or 20 mg/kg doses. Macroscopic and microscopic lung pathology, edema rate, and bacterial burden were evaluated 12 hours post infection and reduced by ASN100. Pharmacokinetic analysis of ASN100 in bronchoalveolar-lavage fluid from uninfected animals detected efficient penetration to lung epithelial lining fluid reaching peak levels between 24 and 48 hours post dosing that were comparable to the mAb concentration measured in serum. These data confirm that the ASN100 mAbs neutralize the powerful cytotoxins of S. aureus in the lung and prevent damage to the mucosal barrier and innate immune cells.","Comparative analysis of exosome isolation methods using culture supernatant for optimum yield, purity and downstream applications.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30926864,Scientific reports,2019 04 06,"Exosomes have received significant attention for their role in pathobiological processes and are being explored as a tool for disease diagnosis and management. Consequently, various isolation methods based on different principles have been developed for exosome isolation. Here we compared the efficacy of four kits from Invitrogen, 101Bio, Wako and iZON along with conventional ultracentrifugation-based method for exosome yield, purity and quality. Cell culture supernatant was used as an abundant source of exosomes, and exosome quantity, size-distribution, zeta-potential, marker-expression and RNA/protein quality were determined. The Invitrogen kit gave the highest yield but the preparation showed broader size-distribution likely due to microvesicle co-precipitation and had the least dispersion stability. Other preparations showed <150 nm size range and good stability. Preparation from iZON column; however, had a broader size-distribution in the lower size range suggestive of some impurities of non-vesicular aggregates. RNA quality from all preparations was comparable; however, proteins from Invitrogen method-based exosomal preparation showed polyethylene glycol (PEG) contamination in mass spectrometry. Chemical impurities from the precipitant could also be the cause of toxicity of Invitrogen method-based exosomal preparation in biological growth measurement assay. Together, these findings should serve as a guide to choose and further optimize exosome isolation methods for their desired downstream applications.",Selective manipulation of the inositol metabolic pathway for induction of salt-tolerance in indica rice variety.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30926863,Scientific reports,2019 04 06,"Halophytes are rich sources of salt stress tolerance genes which have often been utilized for introduction of salt-tolerance character in salt-sensitive plants. In the present study, we overexpressed PcINO1 and PcIMT1 gene(s), earlier characterized in this laboratory from wild halophytic rice Porteresia coarctata, into IR64 indica rice either singly or in combination and assessed their role in conferring salt-tolerance. Homozygous T3/T4 transgenic plants revealed that PcINO1 transformed transgenic rice lines exhibit significantly higher tolerance upto 200 mM or higher salt concentration with negligible compromise in their growth or other physiological parameters compared to the untransformed system grown without stress. The PcIMT1-lines or the double transgenic lines (DC1) having PcINO1 and PcIMT1 introgressed together, were less efficient in such respect. Comparison of inositol and/or pinitol pool in three types of transgenic plants suggests that plants whose inositol production remains uninterrupted under stress by the functional PcINO1 protein, showed normal growth as in the wild-type plants without stress. It is conceivable that inositol itself acts as a stress-ameliorator and/or as a switch for a number of other pathways important for imparting salt-tolerance. Such selective manipulation of the inositol metabolic pathway may be one of the ways to combat salt stress in plants.",HDAC1 and HDAC2 independently regulate common and specific intrinsic responses in murine enteroids.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30926862,Scientific reports,2019 04 06,"Both HDAC1 and HDAC2 are class I deacetylases acting as erasers of lysine-acetyl marks on histones and non-histone proteins. Several histone deacetylase inhibitors, either endogenous to the cell, such as the ketogenic β-hydroxybutyrate metabolite, or exogenous, such as butyrate, a microbial-derived metabolite, regulate HDAC activity. Different combinations of intestinal epithelial cell (IEC)-specific Hdac1 and/or Hdac2 deletion differentially alter mucosal homeostasis in mice. Thus, HDAC1 and HDAC2 could act as sensors and transmitters of environmental signals to the mucosa. In this study, enteroid culture models deleted for Hdac1 or Hdac2 were established to determine IEC-specific function as assessed by global transcriptomic and proteomic approaches. Results show that Hdac1 or Hdac2 deficiency altered differentiation of Paneth and goblet secretory cells, which sustain physical and chemical protection barriers, and increased intermediate secretory cell precursor numbers. Furthermore, IEC Hdac1- and Hdac2-dependent common and specific biological processes were identified, including oxidation-reduction, inflammatory responses, and lipid-related metabolic processes, as well as canonical pathways and upstream regulators related to environment-dependent signaling through steroid receptor pathways, among others. These findings uncover unrecognized regulatory similarities and differences between Hdac1 and Hdac2 in IEC, and demonstrate how HDAC1 and HDAC2 may complement each other to regulate the intrinsic IEC phenotype.",No signal of deleterious mutation accumulation in conserved gene sequences of extant asexual hexapods.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30926861,Scientific reports,2019 04 06,"Loss of sex and recombination is generally assumed to impede the effectiveness of purifying selection and to result in the accumulation of slightly deleterious mutations. Empirical evidence for this has come from several studies investigating mutational load in a small number of individual genes. However, recent whole transcriptome based studies have yielded inconsistent results, hence questioning the validity of the assumption of mutational meltdown in asexual populations. Here, we study the effectiveness of purifying selection in eight asexual hexapod lineages and their sexual relatives, as present in the 1 K Insect Transcriptome Evolution (1KITE) project, covering eight hexapod groups. We analyse the accumulation of slightly deleterious nonsynonymous and synonymous point mutations in 99 single copy orthologue protein-coding loci shared among the investigated taxa. While accumulation rates of nonsynonymous mutations differed between genes and hexapod groups, we found no effect of reproductive mode on the effectiveness of purifying selection acting at nonsynonymous and synonymous sites. Although the setup of this study does not fully rule out nondetection of subtle effects, our data does not support the established consensus of asexual lineages undergoing 'mutational meltdown'.",Direct differentiation of bone marrow mononucleated cells into insulin producing cells using pancreatic β-cell-derived components.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30926860,Scientific reports,2019 04 06,"Transplantation of stem cell-derived insulin producing cells (IPCs) has been proposed as an alternative to islet transplantation for the treatment of diabetes mellitus. However, current IPC differentiation protocols are focused on generating functional cells from the pluripotent stem cells and tend to rely on multistep, long-term exposure to various exogenous factors. In this study, we addressed the observation that under stress, pancreatic β-cells release essential components that direct the differentiation of the bone marrow nucleated cells (BMNCs) into IPCs. Without any supplementation with known differentiation-inducing factors, IPCs can be generated from BMNCs by in vitro priming for 6 days with conditioned media (CM) from the β-cells. In vitro primed BMNCs expressed the β-cell-specific transcription factors, as well as insulin, and improved hyperglycemia and glucose intolerance after transplantation into the streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice. Furthermore, we have found that components of the CM which trigger the differentiation were enclosed by or integrated into micro particles (MPs), rather than being secreted as soluble factors. Identification of these differentiation-directing factors might enable us to develop novel technologies required for the production of clinically applicable IPCs.","Palaeoecology of Voulteryon parvulus (Eucrustacea, Polychelida) from the Middle Jurassic of La Voulte-sur-Rhône Fossil-Lagerstätte (France).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30926859,Scientific reports,2019 04 06,"Exceptional and extremely rare preservation of soft parts, eyes, or syn-vivo associations provide crucial palaeoecological information on fossil-rich deposits. Here we present exceptionally preserved specimens of the polychelidan lobster Voulteryon parvulus, from the Jurassic of La Voulte-sur-Rhône Fossil-Lagerstätte, France, bearing eyes with hexagonal and square facets, ovaries, and a unique association with epibiont thecideoid brachiopods, giving insights onto the palaeoenvironment of this Lagerstätte. The eyes, mostly covered in hexagonal facets are interpreted as either apposition eyes (poorly adapted to low-light environment) or, less likely, as refractive or parabolic superposition eyes (compatible with dysphotic palaeoenvironments). The interpretation that V. parvulus had apposition eyes suggests an allochthonous, shallow water origin. However, the presence of thecideoid brachiopod ectosymbionts on its carapace, usually associated to dim-light paleoenvironments and/or rock crevices, suggests that V. parvulus lived in a dim-light setting. This would support the less parsimonious interpretation that V. parvulus had superposition eyes. If we accept the hypothesis that V. parvulus had apposition eyes, since the La Voulte palaeoenvironment is considered deep water and had a soft substrate, V. parvulus could have moved into the La Voulte Lagerstätte setting. If this is the case, La Voulte biota would record a combination of multiple palaeoenvironments.",UV plasmonic properties of colloidal liquid-metal eutectic gallium-indium alloy nanoparticles.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30926856,Scientific reports,2019 04 06,"Nanoparticles made of non-noble metals such as gallium have recently attracted significant attention due to promising applications in UV plasmonics. To date, experiments have mostly focused on solid and liquid pure gallium particles immobilized on solid substrates. However, for many applications, colloidal liquid-metal nanoparticle solutions are vital. Here, we experimentally demonstrate strong UV plasmonic resonances of eutectic gallium-indium (EGaIn) liquid-metal alloy nanoparticles suspended in ethanol. We rationalise experimental results through a theoretical model based on Mie theory. Our results contribute to the understanding of UV plasmon resonances in colloidal liquid-metal EGaIn nanoparticle suspensions. They will also enable further research into emerging applications of UV plasmonics in biomedical imaging, sensing, stretchable electronics, photoacoustics, and electrochemistry.",Temperature directly and indirectly influences food web structure.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30926855,Scientific reports,2019 04 06,"Understanding whether and how environmental conditions may impact food web structure at a global scale is central to our ability to predict how food webs will respond to climate change. However, such an understanding is nascent. Using the best resolved available food webs to date, I address whether latitude, temperature, or both, explain the number of species and feeding interactions, the proportion of basal and top species, as well as the degree of omnivory, connectance and the number of trophic levels across food webs. I found that temperature is a more parsimonious predictor of food web structure than latitude. Temperature directly reduces the number of species, the proportion of basal species and the number of interactions while it indirectly increases omnivory levels, connectance and trophic level through its direct effects on the fraction and number of basal species. While direct impacts of temperature are routinely taken into account to predict how ecosystems may respond to global climate change, indirect effects have been largely overlooked. These results thus suggest that food webs may be affected by a combination of biotic and abiotic conditions, both directly and indirectly, in a changing world.",Metformin induces the AP-1 transcription factor network in normal dermal fibroblasts.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30926854,Scientific reports,2019 04 06,"Metformin is a widely-used treatment for type 2 diabetes and is reported to extend health and lifespan as a caloric restriction (CR) mimetic. Although the benefits of metformin are well documented, the impact of this compound on the function and organization of the genome in normal tissues is unclear. To explore this impact, primary human fibroblasts were treated in culture with metformin resulting in a significant decrease in cell proliferation without evidence of cell death. Furthermore, metformin induced repositioning of chromosomes 10 and 18 within the nuclear volume indicating altered genome organization. Transcriptome analyses from RNA sequencing datasets revealed that alteration in growth profiles and chromosome positioning occurred concomitantly with changes in gene expression profiles. We further identified that different concentrations of metformin induced different transcript profiles; however, significant enrichment in the activator protein 1 (AP-1) transcription factor network was common between the different treatments. Comparative analyses revealed that metformin induced divergent changes in the transcriptome than that of rapamycin, another proposed mimetic of CR. Promoter analysis and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays of genes that changed expression in response to metformin revealed enrichment of the transcriptional regulator forkhead box O3a (FOXO3a) in normal human fibroblasts, but not of the predicted serum response factor (SRF). Therefore, we have demonstrated that metformin has significant impacts on genome organization and function in normal human fibroblasts, different from those of rapamycin, with FOXO3a likely playing a role in this response."

A logistic regression model was used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and their confidence intervals (CIs). After adjustment for age, prepregnancy BMI, parity, abnormal pregnancy history and family history of diabetes, the minor allele of rs10830962 (C > G) demonstrated a significant association with an increased risk of GDM (OR = 1.16, 95% CI = 1.02-1.31, P = 0.029 in the additive model). However, no significant association was observed between the other two polymorphisms and GDM. Subsequent functional annotation shows that rs10830962 is located in the regulatory elements of pancreatic islets, alters the binding affinity of motifs and regulates SNORA8 expression. Our findings demonstrate that rs10830962 is associated with an increased risk of GDM in the Chinese population. Further functional characterization is warranted to uncover the mechanism of the genotype-phenotype association.",Radiation Tolerance of Nanopore Sequencing Technology for Life Detection on Mars and Europa.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30926841,Scientific reports,2019 04 06,"The search for life beyond Earth is a key motivator in space exploration. Informational polymers, like DNA and RNA, are key biosignatures for life as we know it. The MinION is a miniature DNA sequencer based on versatile nanopore technology that could be implemented on future planetary missions. A critical unanswered question is whether the MinION and its protein-based nanopores can withstand increased radiation exposure outside Earth's shielding magnetic field. We evaluated the effects of ionizing radiation on the MinION platform - including flow cells, reagents, and hardware - and discovered limited performance loss when exposed to ionizing doses comparable to a mission to Mars. Targets with harsher radiation environments, like Europa, would require improved radiation resistance via additional shielding or design refinements.",Interference in speaking while hearing and vice versa.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30926840,Scientific reports,2019 04 06,"Even when speakers are not actively doing another task, they can be interfered in their speech planning by concurrent auditory stimuli. In this study, we used picture naming with passive hearing, or active listening, combined to high-density electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings to investigate the locus and origin of interference on speech production. Participants named pictures while ignoring (or paying attention to) auditory syllables presented at different intervals (+150 ms, +300 ms or +450 ms). Interference of passive hearing was observed at all positive stimulus onset asynchronies (SOA) including when distractors appeared 450 ms after picture onset. Analyses of ERPs and microstates revealed modulations appearing in a time-window close to verbal response onset likely relating to post-lexical planning processes. A shift of latency of the N1 auditory component for syllables displayed 450 ms after picture onset relative to hearing in isolation was also observed. Data from picture naming with active listening to auditory syllables also pointed to post-lexical interference. The present study suggests that, beyond the lexical stage, post-lexical processes can be interfered and that the reciprocal interference between utterance planning and hearing relies on attentional demand and possibly competing neural substrates.",Real-time dosimetry with radiochromic films.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30926839,Scientific reports,2019 04 06,"Radiochromic film dosimetry has been widely employed in most of the applications of radiation physics for over twenty years. This is due to a number of appealing features of radiochromic films, such as reliability, accuracy, ease of use and cost. However, current radiochromic film reading techniques, based on the use of commercial densitometers and scanners, provide values of dose only after the exposure of the films to radiation. In this work, an innovative methodology for the real-time reading of radiochromic films is proposed for some specific applications. The new methodology is based on opto-electronic instrumentation that makes use of an optical fiber probe for the determination of optical changes of the films induced by radiation and allows measurements of dose with high degree of precision and accuracy. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that the dynamic range of some kinds of films, such as the EBT3 Gafchromic films (intensively used in medical physics), can be extended by more than one order of magnitude. Owing to the numerous advantages with respect to the commonly used reading techniques, a National Patent was filed in January 2018.",Increase of genetic diversity indicates ecological opportunities in recurrent-fire landscapes for wall lizards.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30926838,Scientific reports,2019 04 06,"Socioeconomic and climatic factors are modifying fire regimes with an increase of fire frequency and extension. Unfortunately, the effects of recurrent fires on biological processes that ultimately affect the genetic diversity of animal populations are mostly unknown. We examined genetic patterns of diversity in the wall lizard Podarcis guadarramae in northern Portugal, one of the European regions with the highest percentage of burnt land. This species is a small saxicolous lizard as it inhabits natural outcrops and artificial stone walls, likely in recurrent-fire landscapes. We genotyped nine microsatellites from ten populations selected according to a gradient in fire recurrence, and compared genetic diversity indexes and demographic patterns among them. At the population level, we hypothesize that a high level of mortality and population bottlenecks are expected to reduce genetic heterozygosity in sampled localities affected by recurrent fires. Alternatively, genetic signatures are expected to be absent whether fire did not cause high mortality. Regardless of levels of mortality, we expect a gain in genetic diversity whether recurrent fires facilitate lizard dispersal and migration due to the increased quality of the habitat for wall lizards. At the regional level, we examine whether a recurrent fire regime may disrupt the spatial structure of populations. Our results showed an increase in genetic diversity in recurrently burnt populations, and a decline in longer-unburnt populations. We did not detect bottleneck effects in repeatedly-burnt populations. High genetic diversity in recurrent fire populations suggests a high dispersion rate between adjacent metapopulations and perhaps immigration from outside the fire boundary. At the regional level, lizard populations show low differentiation and weak genetic structure, suggesting no effects of fire. This study confirms field-based censuses showing that recurrent-fire regimes give ecological opportunities to wall lizards that benefit from habitat openness.",Monocytes/Macrophages play a pathogenic role in IL-23 mediated psoriasis-like skin inflammation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30926837,Scientific reports,2019 04 06,"Psoriasis is an immune-mediated inflammatory skin disease that affects millions worldwide. Studying immune cells involved in psoriasis pathogenesis is essential to identify effective and safe therapeutics for the disease. Using human psoriasis skin, activated macrophages were observed in both lesional and non-lesional skin, but were elevated in lesional skin. Activation of the IL-23/IL-17 pathway is integral to the development of psoriasis. To further characterize the monocyte/macrophage (Mon/Mac) population when the IL-23 pathway is activated, a murine model of intradermal injection of IL-23 was used. Flow cytometry revealed that Mon/Mac cells were the dominant immune population, particularly late in the model, highlighted by strong presence of Ly6ChiMHC IIhi cells. The Mon/Mac cells were also shown to have high expression for TNFα but not IL-17A. Prophylactic dosing of a CSF-1R inhibitor to deplete Mon/Mac cells significantly reduced several inflammatory mediators from the skin tissue suggesting a pathogenic role for Mon/Mac. Treatment dosing of the inhibitor produced a less robust effect. Mon/Mac cells were also differentiated by levels of Ki67 and TNFα expression. These data point to an important contribution of Mon/Mac cells in IL-23 related skin inflammation and suggest that these cells are a significant player in the underlying pathophysiology of psoriasis.",Reduced expression of pyruvate kinase in kidney proximal tubule cells is a potential mechanism of pravastatin altered glucose metabolism.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30926836,Scientific reports,2019 04 06,"Recent studies have reported that statins are associated with increased incidence of diabetes. Although several mechanisms have been proposed, the role of the kidney's glucose metabolism upon statin treatment is still unclear. Thus, we investigated the role of pravastatin in gluconeogenesis and glycolysis. HK-2 and HepG2 cells were treated with pravastatin and cultured under either high- or normal-cholesterol conditions. In HK-2 cells treated with pravastatin under both high- and normal-cholesterol conditions, the protein expression of only pyruvate kinase isozymes L/R (PKLR) decreased in a dose-dependent manner, while the protein expression of other glucose metabolism related enzymes remained unchanged. Within the in vivo experiment, male C57BL/6 mice were fed either pravastatin-treated normal-fat diets for 2 or 4 weeks or pravastatin-treated high-fat diets for 16 weeks. Protein expression of PKLR in the kidneys from mice that consumed pravastatin-treated high-fat diets decreased significantly compared to the controls. Upon the treatments of pravastatin, only the PKLR expression decreased in lean mice. Furthermore, PKLR activity decreased significantly in the kidney after pravastatin treatments. However, there was no change in enzyme activity in the liver, suggesting that pravastatin decreased PKLR activity only in the kidney. This change may be associated with the hyperglycemic effect of statins.",Multiple ionization state of Arq+ ions during collisions near the Bohr velocity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30926834,Scientific reports,2019 04 06,"In order to clarify the mechanism and the influence of the initial charge state and target atomic parameters for the formation of L-shell multiple ionization state of Arq+ ions produced by the collisions near the Bohr velocity, the k-shell x-ray emission of Ar is measured for 1.2 MeV Arq+(q=4, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12) ions impacting on V target and 3 MeV Ar11+ ions interacting with selected targets (Z2 = 23, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30). It is found that the measured Ar Kα and Kβ x-ray energies shift to the high energy side, and the relative intensity ratios of Kβ/Kα are enlarged than the atomic data, owing to the presence of out-shell multiple vacancies. The multiple ionization is almost independence of the projectile charge state, but is diminished with increasing target atomic number.",Regional variation in life history traits and plastic responses to temperature of the major malaria vector Nyssorhynchus darlingi in Brazil.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30926833,Scientific reports,2019 04 06,"The primary Brazilian malaria vector, Nyssorhynchus darlingi (formerly Anopheles darlingi), ranges from 0°S-23°S across three biomes (Amazonia, Cerrado, Mata Atlântica). Rising temperatures will increase mosquito developmental rates, and models predict future malaria transmission by Ny. darlingi in Brazil will shift southward. We reared F1 Ny. darlingi (progeny of field-collected females from 4 state populations across Brazil) at three temperatures (20, 24, 28 °C) and measured key life-history traits. Our results reveal geographic variation due to both genetic differences among localities and plastic responses to temperature differences. Temperature significantly altered all traits: faster larval development, shorter adult life and overall lifespan, and smaller body sizes were seen at 28 °C versus 20 °C. Low-latitude Amazonia mosquitoes had the fastest larval development at all temperatures, but at 28 °C, average development rate of high-latitude Mata Atlântica mosquitoes was accelerated and equivalent to low-latitude Amazonia. Body size of adult mosquitoes from the Mata Atlântica remained larger at all temperatures. We detected genetic variation in the plastic responses among mosquitoes from different localities, with implications for malaria transmission under climate change. Faster development combined with larger body size, without a tradeoff in adult longevity, suggests vectorial capacities of some Mata Atlântica populations may significantly increase under warming climates.",The putative C-type lectin Schlaff ensures epidermal barrier compactness in Drosophila.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30926832,Scientific reports,2019 04 06,"The stability of extracellular matrices is in general ensured by cross-linking of its components. Previously, we had shown that the integrity of the layered Drosophila cuticle relies on the presence of a covalent cuticular dityrosine network. Production and composition of this structure remained unstudied. In this work, we present our analyses of the schlaff (slf) gene coding for a putative C-type lectin that is needed for the adhesion between the horizontal cuticle layers. The Slf protein mainly localizes between the two layers called epicuticle and procuticle that separate from each other when the function of Slf is reduced or eliminated paralleling the phenotype of a cuticle with reduced extracellular dityrosine. Localisation of the dityrosinylated protein Resilin to the epicuticle-procuticle interface suggests that the dityrosine network mediates the adhesion of the epicuticle to the procuticle. Ultimately, compromised Slf function is associated with massive water loss. In summary, we propose that Slf is implied in the stabilisation of a dityrosine layer especially between the epicuticle and the procuticle that in turn constitutes an outward barrier against uncontrolled water flow."

Here we investigate a physiological role of RAD52 at stalled replication forks by using human cell models depleted of RAD52, a specific small-molecule inhibitor of the RAD52-ssDNA interaction, in vitro and single-molecule analyses. We demonstrate that RAD52 prevents excessive degradation of reversed replication forks by MRE11. Mechanistically, RAD52 binds to the stalled replication fork, promotes its occlusion and counteracts loading of SMARCAL1 in vitro and in vivo. Loss of the RAD52 function results in a slightly-defective replication restart, persistence of under-replicated regions and chromosome instability. Moreover, the RAD52-inhibited cells rely on RAD51 for completion of replication and viability upon replication arrest. Collectively, our data suggest an unexpected gatekeeper mechanism by which RAD52 limits excessive remodelling of stalled replication forks, thus indirectly assisting RAD51 and BRCA2 in protecting forks from unscheduled degradation and preventing genome instability.",Two recipes for repelling hot water.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30926820,Nature communications,2019 04 10,"Although a hydrophobic microtexture at a solid surface most often reflects rain owing to the presence of entrapped air within the texture, it is much more challenging to repel hot water. As it contacts a colder material, hot water generates condensation within the cavities at the solid surface, which eventually builds bridges between the substrate and the water, and thus destroys repellency. Here we show that both ""small"" (~100 nm) and ""large"" (~10 µm) model features do reflect hot drops at any drop temperature and in the whole range of explored impact velocities. Hence, we can define two structural recipes for repelling hot water: drops on nanometric features hardly stick owing to the miniaturization of water bridges, whereas kinetics of condensation in large features is too slow to connect the liquid to the solid at impact.",Automatic mapping of atoms across both simple and complex chemical reactions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30926819,Nature communications,2019 04 10,"Mapping atoms across chemical reactions is important for substructure searches, automatic extraction of reaction rules, identification of metabolic pathways, and more. Unfortunately, the existing mapping algorithms can deal adequately only with relatively simple reactions but not those in which expert chemists would benefit from computer's help. Here we report how a combination of algorithmics and expert chemical knowledge significantly improves the performance of atom mapping, allowing the machine to deal with even the most mechanistically complex chemical and biochemical transformations. The key feature of our approach is the use of few but judiciously chosen reaction templates that are used to generate plausible ""intermediate"" atom assignments which then guide a graph-theoretical algorithm towards the chemically correct isomorphic mappings. The algorithm performs significantly better than the available state-of-the-art reaction mappers, suggesting its uses in database curation, mechanism assignments, and - above all - machine extraction of reaction rules underlying modern synthesis-planning programs.",Structure mapping of dengue and Zika viruses reveals functional long-range interactions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30926818,Nature communications,2019 05 03,"Dengue (DENV) and Zika (ZIKV) viruses are clinically important members of the Flaviviridae family with an 11 kb positive strand RNA genome that folds to enable virus function. Here, we perform structure and interaction mapping on four DENV and ZIKV strains inside virions and in infected cells. Comparative analysis of SHAPE reactivities across serotypes nominates potentially functional regions that are highly structured, conserved, and contain low synonymous mutation rates. Interaction mapping by SPLASH identifies many pair-wise interactions, 40% of which form alternative structures, suggesting extensive structural heterogeneity. Analysis of shared interactions between serotypes reveals a conserved macro-organization whereby interactions can be preserved at physical locations beyond sequence identities. We further observe that longer-range interactions are preferentially disrupted inside cells, and show the importance of new interactions in virus fitness. These findings deepen our understanding of Flavivirus genome organization and serve as a resource for designing therapeutics in targeting RNA viruses.",Intrinsic functional architecture of the non-human primate spinal cord derived from fMRI and electrophysiology.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30926817,Nature communications,2019 05 03,"Resting-state functional MRI (rsfMRI) has recently revealed correlated signals in the spinal cord horns of monkeys and humans. However, the interpretation of these rsfMRI correlations as indicators of functional connectivity in the spinal cord remains unclear. Here, we recorded stimulus-evoked and spontaneous spiking activity and local field potentials (LFPs) from monkey spinal cord in order to validate fMRI measures. We found that both BOLD and electrophysiological signals elicited by tactile stimulation co-localized to the ipsilateral dorsal horn. Temporal profiles of stimulus-evoked BOLD signals covaried with LFP and multiunit spiking in a similar way to those observed in the brain. Functional connectivity of dorsal horns exhibited a U-shaped profile along the dorsal-intermediate-ventral axis. Overall, these results suggest that there is an intrinsic functional architecture within the gray matter of a single spinal segment, and that rsfMRI signals at high field directly reflect this underlying spontaneous neuronal activity.",Charge density wave memory in a cuprate superconductor.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30926816,Nature communications,2019 04 10,"Although CDW correlations are a ubiquitous feature of the superconducting cuprates, their disparate properties suggest a crucial role for pinning the CDW to the lattice. Here, we report coherent resonant X-ray speckle correlation analysis, which directly determines the reproducibility of CDW domain patterns in La1.875Ba0.125CuO4 (LBCO 1/8) with thermal cycling. While CDW order is only observed below 54 K, where a structural phase transition creates inequivalent Cu-O bonds, we discover remarkably reproducible CDW domain memory upon repeated cycling to far higher temperatures. That memory is only lost on cycling to 240(3) K, which recovers the four-fold symmetry of the CuO2 planes. We infer that the structural features that develop below 240 K determine the CDW pinning landscape below 54 K. This opens a view into the complex coupling between charge and lattice degrees of freedom in superconducting cuprates.",Phosphatidylethanolamine made in the inner mitochondrial membrane is essential for yeast cytochrome bc1 complex function.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30926815,Nature communications,2019 05 03,"Of the four separate PE biosynthetic pathways in eukaryotes, one occurs in the mitochondrial inner membrane (IM) and is executed by phosphatidylserine decarboxylase (Psd1). Deletion of Psd1 is lethal in mice and compromises mitochondrial function. We hypothesize that this reflects inefficient import of non-mitochondrial PE into the IM. Here, we test this by re-wiring PE metabolism in yeast by re-directing Psd1 to the outer mitochondrial membrane or the endomembrane system and show that PE can cross the IMS in both directions. Nonetheless, PE synthesis in the IM is critical for cytochrome bc1 complex (III) function and mutations predicted to disrupt a conserved PE-binding site in the complex III subunit, Qcr7, impair complex III activity similar to PSD1 deletion. Collectively, these data challenge the current dogma of PE trafficking and demonstrate that PE made in the IM by Psd1 support the intrinsic functionality of complex III.",Excessive mechanical loading promotes osteoarthritis through the gremlin-1-NF-κB pathway.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30926814,Nature communications,2019 05 03,"Exposure of articular cartilage to excessive mechanical loading is deeply involved in the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis. Here, we identify gremlin-1 as a mechanical loading-inducible factor in chondrocytes, detected at high levels in middle and deep layers of cartilage after cyclic strain or hydrostatic pressure loading. Gremlin-1 activates nuclear factor-κB signalling, leading to subsequent induction of catabolic enzymes. In mice intra-articular administration of gremlin-1 antibody or chondrocyte-specific deletion of Gremlin-1 decelerates osteoarthritis development, while intra-articular administration of recombinant gremlin-1 exacerbates this process. Furthermore, ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 activation induced by mechanical loading enhances reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Amongst ROS-activating transcription factors, RelA/p65 induces Gremlin-1 transcription, which antagonizes induction of anabolic genes such as Sox9, Col2a1, and Acan by bone morphogenetic proteins. Thus, gremlin-1 plays essential roles in cartilage degeneration by excessive mechanical loading.",Integrated charge excitation triboelectric nanogenerator.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30926813,Nature communications,2019 04 10,"Performance of triboelectric nanogenerators is limited by low and unstable charge density on tribo-layers. An external-charge pumping method was recently developed and presents a promising and efficient strategy towards high-output triboelectric nanogenerators.

Inspired by the historical development of electromagnetic generators, here, we propose and realize a self-charge excitation triboelectric nanogenerator system towards high and stable output in analogy to the principle of traditional magnetic excitation generators. By rational design of the voltage-multiplying circuits, the completed external and self-charge excitation modes with stable and tailorable output over 1.25 mC m-2 in contact-separation mode have been realized in ambient condition. The realization of the charge excitation system in this work may provide a promising strategy for achieving high-output triboelectric nanogenerators towards practical applications.",Wnt1 silences chemokine genes in dendritic cells and induces adaptive immune resistance in lung adenocarcinoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30926812,Nature communications,2019 05 03,"Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD)-derived Wnts increase cancer cell proliferative/stemness potential, but whether they impact the immune microenvironment is unknown. Here we show that LUAD cells use paracrine Wnt1 signaling to induce immune resistance. In TCGA, Wnt1 correlates strongly with tolerogenic genes. In another LUAD cohort, Wnt1 inversely associates with T cell abundance. Altering Wnt1 expression profoundly affects growth of murine lung adenocarcinomas and this is dependent on conventional dendritic cells (cDCs) and T cells. Mechanistically, Wnt1 leads to transcriptional silencing of CC/CXC chemokines in cDCs, T cell exclusion and cross-tolerance. Wnt-target genes are up-regulated in human intratumoral cDCs and decrease upon silencing Wnt1, accompanied by enhanced T cell cytotoxicity. siWnt1-nanoparticles given as single therapy or part of combinatorial immunotherapies act at both arms of the cancer-immune ecosystem to halt tumor growth.

By sweeping over the coherence length of the transmitted signal, the partially coherent radar experimentally demonstrates an improvement of over an order of magnitude in resolving targets, compared to standard coherent radars with the same bandwidth. A theoretical framework is developed to show that the resolution could be further improved without a bound, revealing a tradeoff between bandwidth and sweep time. This concept offers solutions to problems which require high range resolution and accuracy but available bandwidth is limited, as is the case for the autonomous car industry, optical imaging, and astronomy to name just few.",Scalable synthesis of ant-nest-like bulk porous silicon for high-performance lithium-ion battery anodes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30926799,Nature communications,2019 04 10,"Although silicon is a promising anode material for lithium-ion batteries, scalable synthesis of silicon anodes with good cyclability and low electrode swelling remains a significant challenge.

A variety of syndromic and non-syndromic neurodevelopmental disorders have been connected to alterations in metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) signalling. These receptors contribute to synaptic plasticity, spine maturation and circuit development. Here, we investigate the physiological role of Gprasp2, a gene linked to neurodevelopmental disabilities and involved in the postendocytic sorting of G-protein-coupled receptors. We show that Gprasp2 deletion leads to ASD-like behaviour in mice and alterations in synaptic communication. Manipulating the levels of Gprasp2 bidirectionally modulates the surface availability of mGluR5 and produces alterations in dendritic complexity, spine density and synaptic maturation. Loss of Gprasp2 leads to enhanced hippocampal long-term depression, consistent with facilitated mGluR-dependent activation. These findings demonstrate a role for Gprasp2 in glutamatergic synapses and suggest a possible mechanism by which this gene is linked to neurodevelopmental diseases.",Scale law of complex deformation transitions of nanotwins in stainless steel.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30926796,Nature communications,2019 04 10,"Understanding the deformation behavior of metallic materials containing nanotwins (NTs), which can enhance both strength and ductility, is useful for tailoring microstructures at the micro- and nano- scale to enhance mechanical properties. Here, we construct a clear deformation pattern of NTs in austenitic stainless steel by combining in situ tensile tests with a dislocation-based theoretical model and molecular dynamics simulations. Deformation NTs are observed in situ using a transmission electron microscope in different sample regions containing NTs with twin-lamella-spacing (λ) varying from a few nanometers to hundreds of nanometers. Two deformation transitions are found experimentally: from coactivated twinning/detwinning (λ < 5 nm) to secondary twinning (5 nm < λ < 129 nm), and then to the dislocation glide (λ > 129 nm). The simulation results are highly consistent with the observed strong λ-effect, and reveal the intrinsic transition mechanisms induced by partial dislocation slip.",USP32 regulates late endosomal transport and recycling through deubiquitylation of Rab7.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30926795,Nature communications,2019 05 03,"The endosomal system is a highly dynamic multifunctional organelle, whose complexity is regulated in part by reversible ubiquitylation. Despite the wide-ranging influence of ubiquitin in endosomal processes, relatively few enzymes utilizing ubiquitin have been described to control endosome integrity and function. Here we reveal the deubiquitylating enzyme (DUB) ubiquitin-specific protease 32 (USP32) as a powerful player in this context. Loss of USP32 inhibits late endosome (LE) transport and recycling of LE cargos, resulting in dispersion and swelling of the late compartment. Using SILAC-based ubiquitome profiling we identify the small GTPase Rab7-the logistical centerpiece of LE biology-as a substrate of USP32. Mechanistic studies reveal that LE transport effector RILP prefers ubiquitylation-deficient Rab7, while retromer-mediated LE recycling benefits from an intact cycle of Rab7 ubiquitylation. Collectively, our observations suggest that reversible ubiquitylation helps switch Rab7 between its various functions, thereby maintaining global spatiotemporal order in the endosomal system.",Genomic and transcriptomic changes complement each other in the pathogenesis of sporadic Burkitt lymphoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30926794,Nature communications,2019 05 03,"Burkitt lymphoma (BL) is the most common B-cell lymphoma in children. Within the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC), we performed whole genome and transcriptome sequencing of 39 sporadic BL. Here, we unravel interaction of structural, mutational, and transcriptional changes, which contribute to MYC oncogene dysregulation together with the pathognomonic IG-MYC translocation. Moreover, by mapping IGH translocation breakpoints, we provide evidence that the precursor of at least a subset of BL is a B-cell poised to express IGHA. We describe the landscape of mutations, structural variants, and mutational processes, and identified a series of driver genes in the pathogenesis of BL, which can be targeted by various mechanisms, including IG-non MYC translocations, germline and somatic mutations, fusion transcripts, and alternative splicing.",Prospective discovery of small molecule enhancers of an E3 ligase-substrate interaction.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30926793,Nature communications,2019 05 03,"Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) governing the recognition of substrates by E3 ubiquitin ligases are critical to cellular function. There is significant therapeutic potential in the development of small molecules that modulate these interactions; however, rational design of small molecule enhancers of PPIs remains elusive. Herein, we report the prospective identification and rational design of potent small molecules that enhance the interaction between an oncogenic transcription factor, β-Catenin, and its cognate E3 ligase, SCFβ-TrCP. These enhancers potentiate the ubiquitylation of mutant β-Catenin by β-TrCP in vitro and induce the degradation of an engineered mutant β-Catenin in a cellular system. Distinct from PROTACs, these drug-like small molecules insert into a naturally occurring PPI interface, with contacts optimized for both the substrate and ligase within the same small molecule entity. The prospective discovery of 'molecular glue' presented here provides a paradigm for the development of small molecule degraders targeting hard-to-drug proteins.",Targeting bivalency de-represses Indian Hedgehog and inhibits self-renewal of colorectal cancer-initiating cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30926792,Nature communications,2019 05 03,"In embryonic stem cells, promoters of key lineage-specific differentiation genes are found in a bivalent state, having both activating H3K4me3 and repressive H3K27me3 histone marks, making them poised for transcription upon loss of H3K27me3. Whether cancer-initiating cells (C-ICs) have similar epigenetic mechanisms that prevent lineage commitment is unknown. Here we show that colorectal C-ICs (CC-ICs) are maintained in a stem-like state through a bivalent epigenetic mechanism. Disruption of the bivalent state through inhibition of the H3K27 methyltransferase EZH2, resulted in decreased self-renewal of patient-derived C-ICs. Epigenomic analyses revealed that the promoter of Indian Hedgehog (IHH), a canonical driver of normal colonocyte differentiation, exists in a bivalent chromatin state. Inhibition of EZH2 resulted in de-repression of IHH, decreased self-renewal, and increased sensitivity to chemotherapy in vivo. Our results reveal an epigenetic block to differentiation in CC-ICs and demonstrate the potential for epigenetic differentiation therapy of a solid tumour through EZH2 inhibition."

Here we report the orthologous but cAMP-independent PKA of the protozoan Trypanosoma and identify 7-deaza-nucleosides as potent activators (EC50 ≥ 6.5 nM) and high affinity ligands (KD ≥ 8 nM). A co-crystal structure of trypanosome PKA with 7-cyano-7-deazainosine and molecular docking show how substitution of key amino acids in both CNB domains of the regulatory subunit and its unique C-terminal αD helix account for this ligand swap between trypanosome PKA and canonical cAMP-dependent PKAs. We propose nucleoside-related endogenous activators of Trypanosoma brucei PKA (TbPKA). The existence of eukaryotic CNB domains not associated with binding of cyclic nucleotides suggests that orphan CNB domains in other eukaryotes may bind undiscovered signalling molecules.

This post-translational modification is regulated by lysine methyltransferases and lysine demethylases. Recent studies using mass-spectrometric techniques have revealed that in addition to histones, a great number of transcription factors are also methylated, often at multiple sites and to different degrees (mono-, di-, trimethyl lysine). The biomedical significance of transcription factor methylation in human diseases, including cancer, has been explored recently. Some studies have demonstrated that interfering with transcription factor lysine methylation both in vitro and in vivo can inhibit cancer cell proliferation, thereby reversing tumor progression. The inhibitors targeting lysine methyltransferases and lysine demethylases have been under development for the past two decades, and may be used as potential anticancer agents in the clinic. In this review, we focus on the current findings of transcription factor lysine methylation, and the effects on both transcriptional activity and target gene expression. We outlined the biological significance of transcription factor lysine methylation on tumor progression and highlighted its clinical value in cancer therapy.",Mice with Calr mutations homologous to human CALR mutations only exhibit mild thrombocytosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30926777,Blood cancer journal,2019 04 02,"Calreticulin (CALR) exon 9 frameshift mutations, commonly detected in essential thrombocythemia (ET) and primary myelofibrosis patients, activate signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) proteins in the presence of Myeloproliferative Leukemia Virus (MPL) and induce ET in vivo. Loss of the KDEL motif, an endoplasmic reticulum retention signal, and generation of many positively charged amino acids (AAs) in the mutated C-terminus are thought to be important for disease induction. To test this hypothesis, we generated mice harboring a Calr frameshift mutation using the CRISPR/Cas9 system. Deletion of 19-base pairs in exon 9 (c.1099-1117del), designated the del19 mutation, induced loss of the KDEL motif and generated many positively charged AAs, similar to human mutants. Calr del19 mice exhibited mild thrombocytosis, slightly increased megakaryocytes, and mild splenomegaly. In vitro experiments revealed that the murine CALR del19 mutant had a weaker ability to combine with murine MPL than the human CALR del52 mutant. Consequently, STAT5 activation was also very weak downstream of the murine mutant and murine MPL, and may be the reason for the mild disease severity. In summary, loss of the KDEL motif and positively charged AAs in the C-terminus of CALR is insufficient for MPL binding and ET development.",Human RAD51 paralogue SWSAP1 fosters RAD51 filament by regulating the anti-recombinase FIGNL1 AAA+ ATPase.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30926776,Nature communications,2019 05 29,"RAD51 assembly on single-stranded (ss)DNAs is a crucial step in the homology-dependent repair of DNA damage for genomic stability. The formation of the RAD51 filament is promoted by various RAD51-interacting proteins including RAD51 paralogues. However, the mechanisms underlying the differential control of RAD51-filament dynamics by these factors remain largely unknown. Here, we report a role for the human RAD51 paralogue, SWSAP1, as a novel regulator of RAD51 assembly. Swsap1-deficient cells show defects in DNA damage-induced RAD51 assembly during both mitosis and meiosis. Defective RAD51 assembly in SWSAP1-depleted cells is suppressed by the depletion of FIGNL1, which binds to RAD51 as well as SWSAP1. Purified FIGNL1 promotes the dissociation of RAD51 from ssDNAs. The dismantling activity of FIGNL1 does not require its ATPase but depends on RAD51-binding. Purified SWSAP1 inhibits the RAD51-dismantling activity of FIGNL1. Taken together, our data suggest that SWSAP1 protects RAD51 filaments by antagonizing the anti-recombinase, FIGNL1.",Stacking angle-tunable photoluminescence from interlayer exciton states in twisted bilayer graphene.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30926775,Nature communications,2019 04 10,"Twisted bilayer graphene (tBLG) is a metallic material with two degenerate van Hove singularity transitions that can rehybridize to form interlayer exciton states. Here we report photoluminescence (PL) emission from tBLG after resonant 2-photon excitation, which tunes with the interlayer stacking angle, θ. We spatially image individual tBLG domains at room-temperature and show a five-fold resonant PL-enhancement over the background hot-electron emission. Prior theory predicts that interlayer orbitals mix to create 2-photon-accessible strongly-bound (~0.7 eV) exciton and continuum-edge states, which we observe as two spectral peaks in both PL excitation and excited-state absorption spectra. This peak splitting provides independent estimates of the exciton binding energy which scales from 0.5-0.7 eV with θ = 7.5° to 16.5°. A predicted vanishing exciton-continuum coupling strength helps explain both the weak resonant PL and the slower 1 ps-1 exciton relaxation rate observed.

Following the surgical resection of primary EMT6 tumors, mice do not develop detectable metastasis and reject IV-injected tumor cells. In contrast, these cells readily grow and metastasize in immuno-deficient athymic or Rag2-/- mice, an effect mimicked by CD8+ T-cell depletion in immunocompetent mice. Furthermore, recombinant G-CSF or adoptive transfer of granulocytic-MDSCs isolated from 4T1 tumor-bearing mice, induce metastasis by suppressing CD8+ T-cells in EMT6-primed mice.

Long-acting (LA) depot injections of nanomilled poorly water-soluble ARVs have shown highly promising clinical results with drug exposure largely maintained over months after a single injection. ARV oral combinations rely on water-soluble backbone drugs which are not compatible with nanomilling.

Its abnormal levels are associated with multiple human diseases, such as neurodegenerative disease, myocardial injury, and ophthalmic diseases. Excessive exposure to H2S could lead to cellular toxicity, orchestrate pathological process, and increase the risk of various diseases. Interestingly, under physiological status, H2S plays a critical role in maintaining cellular physiology and limiting damages to tissues. In mammalian species, the generation of H2S is catalyzed by cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS), cystathionine gamma-lyase (CSE), 3-mercapto-methylthio pyruvate aminotransferase (3MST) and cysteine aminotransferase (CAT). These enzymes are found inside the mammalian eyeballs at different locations. Their aberrant expression and the accumulation of substrates and intermediates can change the level of H2S by orders of magnitude, causing abnormal structures or functions in the eyes. Detailed investigations have demonstrated that H2S donors' administration could regulate intraocular pressure, protect retinal cells, inhibit oxidative stress and alleviate inflammation by modulating the function of intra or extracellular proteins in ocular tissues. Thus, several slow-releasing H2S donors have been shown to be promising drugs for treating multiple diseases. In this review, we discuss the biological function of H2S metabolism and its application in ophthalmic diseases.",Phase I trial of isatuximab monotherapy in the treatment of refractory multiple myeloma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30926770,Blood cancer journal,2019 05 07,"This phase I dose-escalation/expansion study evaluated isatuximab (anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody) monotherapy in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM). Patients progressing on or after standard therapy received intravenous isatuximab (weekly [QW] or every 2 weeks [Q2W]). The primary objective was to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of isatuximab. Overall, 84 patients received ≥ 1 dose of isatuximab. The MTD was not reached; no cumulative adverse reactions were noted. The most frequent adverse events were infusion reactions (IRs), occurring in 37/73 patients (51%) following introduction of mandatory prophylaxis. IRs were mostly grade 1/2, occurred predominantly during Cycle 1, and led to treatment discontinuation in two patients. CD38 receptor occupancy reached a plateau of 80% with isatuximab 20 mg/kg (highest dose tested) and was associated with clinical response. In patients receiving isatuximab ≥ 10 mg/kg, overall response rate (ORR) was 23.8% (15/63), including one complete response. In high-risk patients treated with isatuximab 10 mg/kg (QW or Q2W), ORR was 16.7% (3/18). Median (range) duration of response at doses ≥ 10 mg/kg was 25 (8-30) weeks among high-risk patients versus 36 (6-85) weeks for other patients.

This order parameter is spatially uniform in the simplest cases, for example the macroscopic magnetization of a ferromagnetic material. Non-uniform situations also exist in nature, for instance in antiferromagnetic materials, where the magnetization alternates in space, or in the so-called stripe phases emerging for itinerant electrons in strongly correlated materials. Understanding such inhomogeneously ordered states is of central importance in many-body physics. Here we study experimentally the magnetic ordering of itinerant spin-1 bosons in inhomegeneous spin domains at nano-Kelvin temperatures. We demonstrate that spin domains form spontaneously, that is purely because of the antiferromagnetic interactions between the atoms and in the absence of external magnetic forces, after a phase separation transition. Furthermore, we explore how the equilibrium domain configuration emerges from an initial state prepared far from equilibrium."

The extracellular adenosine-generating enzyme CD73 is involved in many cellular functions that can be usurped by tumors, including cell adhesion, proliferation, invasion, and angiogenesis. We set out to determine the role of CD73 in GB pathogenesis. To do this, we established a unique GB mouse model (CD73-FLK) in which we spatially expressed CD73 on endothelial cells in CD73-/- mice. This allowed us to elucidate the mechanism of host CD73 versus GB-expressed CD73 by comparing GB pathogenesis in WT, CD73-/-, and CD73-FLK mice. GB in CD73-/- mice had decreased tumor size, decreased tumor vessel density, and reduced tumor invasiveness compared with GB in WT mice. Interestingly, GBs in CD73-FLK mice were much more invasive and caused complete distortion of the brain morphology. We showed a 20-fold upregulation of A2B AR on GB compared with sham, and its activation induced matrix metalloproteinase-2, which enhanced GB pathogenesis. Inhibition of A2B AR signaling decreased multidrug resistance transporter protein expression, including permeability glycoprotein (P-gp) and multidrug resistance-associated protein 1 (MRP1). Further, we showed that blockade of A2B AR signaling potently increased GB cell death induced by the chemotherapeutic drug temozolomide. Together, these findings suggest that CD73 and A2B AR play a multifaceted role in GB pathogenesis and progression and that targeting the CD73-A2B AR axis can benefit GB patients and inform new approaches for therapy to treat GB patients.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Glioblastoma (GB) is the most devastating primary brain tumor. GB patients' median survival is 16 months even with treatment. It is critical that we develop prophylaxes to advance GB treatment and improve patient survival. CD73-generated adenosine has been implicated in cancer pathogenesis, but its role in GB was not ascertained. Here, we demonstrated that host CD73 plays a prominent role in multiple areas of glioblastoma pathogenesis, including promoting GB growth, its angiogenesis, and its invasiveness. We found a 20-fold increase in A2B adenosine receptor (AR) expression on GB compared with sham, and its inhibition increased GB chemosensitivity to temozolomide. These findings strongly indicate that blockade or inhibition of CD73 and the A2B AR are prime targets for future GB therapy.",Simulated Saccadic Stimuli Suppress ON-Type Direction-Selective Retinal Ganglion Cells via Glycinergic Inhibition.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30926751,The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,2019 06 15,"Two types of mammalian direction-selective ganglion cells (DSGCs), ON and ONOFF, operate over different speed ranges. The directional axes of the ON-DSGCs are thought to align with the axes of the vestibular system and provide sensitivity at rotational velocities that are too slow to activate the semicircular canals. ONOFF-DSGCs respond to faster image velocities. Using natural images that simulate the natural visual inputs to freely moving animals, we show that simulated visual saccades suppress responses in ON-DSGCs but not ONOFF-DSGCs recorded in retinas of domestic rabbits of either gender. Analysis of the synaptic inputs shows that this saccadic suppression results from glycinergic inputs that are specific to ON-DSGCs and are absent in ONOFF-DSGCs. When this glycinergic input is blocked, both cell types respond similarly to visual saccades and display essentially identical speed tuning. The results demonstrate that glycinergic circuits within the retina can produce saccadic suppression of retinal ganglion cell activity. The cell-type-specific targeting of the glycinergic circuits further supports the proposed physiological roles of ON-DSGCs in retinal-image stabilization and of ONOFF-DSGCs in detecting local object motion and signaling optical flow.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT In the mammalian retina, ON direction-selective ganglion cells (DSGCs) respond preferentially to slow image motion, whereas ONOFF-DSGCs respond better to rapid motion. The mechanisms producing this different speed tuning remain unclear. Here we show that simulated visual saccades suppress ON-DSGCs, but not ONOFF-DSGCs. This selective saccadic suppression is because of the selective targeting of glycinergic inhibitory synaptic inputs to ON-DSGCs. The different saccadic suppression in the two cell types points to different physiological roles, consistent with their projections to distinct areas within the brain. ON-DSGCs may be critical for providing the visual feedback signals that contribute to stabilizing the image on the retina, whereas ONOFF-DSGCs may be important for detecting the onset of saccades or for signaling optical flow.",GABAergic Medial Septal Neurons with Low-Rhythmic Firing Innervating the Dentate Gyrus and Hippocampal Area CA3.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30926750,The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,2019 06 15,"The medial septum implements cortical theta oscillations, a 5-12 Hz rhythm associated with locomotion and paradoxical sleep reflecting synchronization of neuronal assemblies such as place cell sequence coding. Highly rhythmic burst-firing parvalbumin-positive GABAergic medial septal neurons are strongly coupled to theta oscillations and target cortical GABAergic interneurons, contributing to coordination within one or several cortical regions. However, a large population of medial septal neurons of unidentified neurotransmitter phenotype and with unknown axonal target areas fire with a low degree of rhythmicity. We investigated whether low-rhythmic-firing neurons (LRNs) innervated similar or different cortical regions to high-rhythmic-firing neurons (HRNs) and assessed their temporal dynamics in awake male mice. The majority of LRNs were GABAergic and parvalbumin-immunonegative, some expressing calbindin; they innervated interneurons mostly in the dentate gyrus (DG) and CA3. Individual LRNs showed several distinct firing patterns during immobility and locomotion, forming a parallel inhibitory stream for the modulation of cortical interneurons. Despite their fluctuating firing rates, the preferred firing phase of LRNs during theta oscillations matched the highest firing probability phase of principal cells in the DG and CA3. In addition, as a population, LRNs were markedly suppressed during hippocampal sharp-wave ripples, had a low burst incidence, and several of them did not fire on all theta cycles. Therefore, CA3 receives GABAergic input from both HRNs and LRNs, but the DG receives mainly LRN input. We propose that distinct GABAergic LRNs contribute to changing the excitability of the DG and CA3 during memory discrimination via transient disinhibition of principal cells.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT For the encoding and recall of episodic memories, nerve cells in the cerebral cortex are activated in precisely timed sequences. Rhythmicity facilitates the coordination of neuronal activity and these rhythms are detected as oscillations of different frequencies such as 5-12 Hz theta oscillations. Degradation of these rhythms, such as through neurodegeneration, causes memory deficits. The medial septum, a part of the basal forebrain that innervates the hippocampal formation, contains high- and low-rhythmic-firing neurons (HRNs and LRNs, respectively), which may contribute differentially to cortical neuronal coordination. We discovered that GABAergic LRNs preferentially innervate the dentate gyrus and the CA3 area of the hippocampus, regions important for episodic memory. These neurons act in parallel with the HRNs mostly via transient inhibition of inhibitory neurons.",The Lactate Receptor HCAR1 Modulates Neuronal Network Activity through the Activation of Gα and Gβγ Subunits.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30926749,The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,2019 06 14,"The discovery of a G-protein-coupled receptor for lactate named hydroxycarboxylic acid receptor 1 (HCAR1) in neurons has pointed to additional nonmetabolic effects of lactate for regulating neuronal network activity. In this study, we characterized the intracellular pathways engaged by HCAR1 activation, using mouse primary cortical neurons from wild-type (WT) and HCAR1 knock-out (KO) mice from both sexes. Using whole-cell patch clamp, we found that the activation of HCAR1 with 3-chloro-5-hydroxybenzoic acid (3Cl-HBA) decreased miniature EPSC frequency, increased paired-pulse ratio, decreased firing frequency, and modulated membrane intrinsic properties. Using fast calcium imaging, we show that HCAR1 agonists 3,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid, 3Cl-HBA, and lactate decreased by 40% spontaneous calcium spiking activity of primary cortical neurons from WT but not from HCAR1 KO mice. Notably, in neurons lacking HCAR1, the basal activity was increased compared with WT. HCAR1 mediates its effect in neurons through a Giα-protein. We observed that the adenylyl cyclase-cAMP-protein kinase A axis is involved in HCAR1 downmodulation of neuronal activity. We found that HCAR1 interacts with adenosine A1, GABAB, and α2A-adrenergic receptors, through a mechanism involving both its Giα and Giβγ subunits, resulting in a complex modulation of neuronal network activity. We conclude that HCAR1 activation in neurons causes a downmodulation of neuronal activity through presynaptic mechanisms and by reducing neuronal excitability. HCAR1 activation engages both Giα and Giβγ intracellular pathways to functionally interact with other Gi-coupled receptors for the fine tuning of neuronal activity.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Expression of the lactate receptor hydroxycarboxylic acid receptor 1 (HCAR1) was recently described in neurons. Here, we describe the physiological role of this G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) and its activation in neurons, providing information on its expression and mechanism of action. We dissected out the intracellular pathway through which HCAR1 activation tunes down neuronal network activity. For the first time, we provide evidence for the functional cross talk of HCAR1 with other GPCRs, such as GABAB, adenosine A1- and α2A-adrenergic receptors. These results set HCAR1 as a new player for the regulation of neuronal network activity acting in concert with other established receptors. Thus, HCAR1 represents a novel therapeutic target for pathologies characterized by network hyperexcitability dysfunction, such as epilepsy.",Vesicular Glutamatergic Transmission in Noise-Induced Loss and Repair of Cochlear Ribbon Synapses.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30926748,The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,2019 06 15,"Noise-induced excitotoxicity is thought to depend on glutamate. However, the excitotoxic mechanisms are unknown, and the necessity of glutamate for synapse loss or regeneration is unclear. Despite absence of glutamatergic transmission from cochlear inner hair cells in mice lacking the vesicular glutamate transporter-3 (Vglut3KO ), at 9-11 weeks, approximately half the number of synapses found in Vglut3WT were maintained as postsynaptic AMPA receptors juxtaposed with presynaptic ribbons and voltage-gated calcium channels (CaV1.3). Synapses were larger in Vglut3KO than Vglut3WT In Vglut3WT and Vglut3+/- mice, 8-16 kHz octave-band noise exposure at 100 dB sound pressure level caused a threshold shift (∼40 dB) and a loss of synapses (>50%) at 24 h after exposure. Hearing threshold and synapse number partially recovered by 2 weeks after exposure as ribbons became larger, whereas recovery was significantly better in Vglut3WT Noise exposure at 94 dB sound pressure level caused auditory threshold shifts that fully recovered in 2 weeks, whereas suprathreshold hearing recovered faster in Vglut3WT than Vglut3+/- These results, from mice of both sexes, suggest that spontaneous repair of synapses after noise depends on the level of Vglut3 protein or the level of glutamate release during the recovery period. Noise-induced loss of presynaptic ribbons or postsynaptic AMPA receptors was not observed in Vglut3KO , demonstrating its dependence on vesicular glutamate release. In Vglut3WT and Vglut3+/-, noise exposure caused unpairing of presynaptic ribbons and presynaptic CaV1.3, but not in Vglut3KO where CaV1.3 remained clustered with ribbons at presynaptic active zones. These results suggest that, without glutamate release, noise-induced presynaptic Ca2+ influx was insufficient to disassemble the active zone. However, synapse volume increased by 2 weeks after exposure in Vglut3KO , suggesting glutamate-independent mechanisms.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Hearing depends on glutamatergic transmission mediated by Vglut3, but the role of glutamate in synapse loss and repair is unclear. Here, using mice of both sexes, we show that one copy of the Vglut3 gene is sufficient for noise-induced threshold shift and loss of ribbon synapses, but both copies are required for normal recovery of hearing function and ribbon synapse number. Impairment of the recovery process in mice having only one functional copy suggests that glutamate release may promote synapse regeneration. At least one copy of the Vglut3 gene is necessary for noise-induced synapse loss. Although the excitotoxic mechanism remains unknown, these findings are consistent with the presumption that glutamate is the key mediator of noise-induced synaptopathy.",A Role for Sensory end Organ-Derived Signals in Regulating Muscle Spindle Proprioceptor Phenotype.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30926747,The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,2019 06 15,"Proprioceptive feedback from Group Ia/II muscle spindle afferents and Group Ib Golgi tendon afferents is critical for the normal execution of most motor tasks, yet how these distinct proprioceptor subtypes emerge during development remains poorly understood. Using molecular genetic approaches in mice of either sex, we identified 24 transcripts that have not previously been associated with a proprioceptor identity. Combinatorial expression analyses of these markers reveal at least three molecularly distinct proprioceptor subtypes. In addition, we find that 12 of these transcripts are expressed well after proprioceptors innervate their respective sensory receptors, and expression of three of these markers, including the heart development molecule Heg1, is significantly reduced in mice that lack muscle spindles. These data reveal Heg1 as a putative marker for proprioceptive muscle spindle afferents. Moreover, they suggest that the phenotypic specialization of functionally distinct proprioceptor subtypes depends, in part, on extrinsic sensory receptor organ-derived signals.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Sensory feedback from muscle spindle (MS) and Golgi tendon organ (GTO) sensory end organs is critical for normal motor control, but how distinct MS and GTO afferent sensory neurons emerge during development remains poorly understood. Using (bulk) transcriptome analysis of genetically identified proprioceptors, this work reveals molecular markers for distinct proprioceptor subsets, including some that appear selectively expressed in MS afferents. Detailed analysis of the expression of these transcripts provides evidence that MS/GTO afferent subtype phenotypes may, at least in part, emerge through extrinsic, sensory end organ-derived signals.",Deletion of neuronal GLT-1 in mice reveals its role in synaptic glutamate homeostasis and mitochondrial function.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30926746,The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,2019 03 30,"The glutamate transporter GLT-1 is highly expressed in astrocytes but also in neurons, primarily in axon terminals. We generated a conditional neuronal GLT-1 knockout using synapsin 1-Cre (synGLT-1 KO) to elucidate the metabolic functions of GLT-1 expressed in neurons, here focusing on the cerebral cortex. Both synaptosomal uptake studies and electron microscopic immunocytochemistry demonstrated knockdown of GLT-1 in the cerebral cortex in the synGLT-1 KO mice. Aspartate content was significantly reduced in cerebral cortical extracts as well as synaptosomes from cerebral cortex of synGLT-1 KO compared to control littermates. 13C-Labelling of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates originating from metabolism of [U-13C]-glutamate was significantly reduced in synGLT-1 KO synaptosomes. The decreased aspartate content was due to diminished entry of glutamate into the TCA cycle. Pyruvate recycling, a pathway necessary for full glutamate oxidation, was also decreased. ATP production was significantly increased, despite unaltered oxygen consumption, in isolated mitochondria from the synGLT-1 KO. Density of mitochondria in axon terminals and peri-synaptic astrocytes were increased in the synGLT-1 KO. Intramitochondrial cristae density of synGLT-1 KO mice was increased suggesting increased mitochondrial efficiency, perhaps in compensation for reduced access to glutamate. SynGLT-1 KO synaptosomes exhibited an elevated oxygen consumption rate when stimulated with veratridine, despite a lower baseline oxygen consumption rate in the presence of glucose. GLT-1 expressed in neurons appears to be required to provide glutamate to synaptic mitochondria and is linked to neuronal energy metabolism and mitochondrial function.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTAll synaptic transmitters need to be cleared from the extracellular space after release, and transporters are used to clear glutamate released from excitatory synapses. GLT-1 is the major glutamate transporter, and most GLT-1 is expressed in astrocytes. Only 5-10% is expressed in neurons, primarily in axon terminals. The function of GLT-1 in axon terminals remains unknown. Here, we used a conditional knockout approach to investigate the significance of the expression of GLT-1 in neurons. We found multiple abnormalities of mitochondrial function suggesting impairment of glutamate utilization by synaptic mitochondria in the neuronal GLT-1 knockout. These data suggest that GLT-1 expressed in axon terminals may be important in maintaining energy metabolism and biosynthetic activities mediated by presynaptic mitochondria.",TrkB-Shc Signaling Protects against Hippocampal Injury Following Status Epilepticus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30926745,The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,2019 06 14,"Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is a common and commonly devastating form of human epilepsy for which only symptomatic therapy is available. One cause of TLE is an episode of de novo prolonged seizures [status epilepticus (SE)]. Understanding the molecular signaling mechanisms by which SE transforms a brain from normal to epileptic may reveal novel targets for preventive and disease-modifying therapies. SE-induced activation of the BDNF receptor tyrosine kinase, TrkB, is one signaling pathway by which SE induces TLE. Although activation of TrkB signaling promotes development of epilepsy in this context, it also reduces SE-induced neuronal death. This led us to hypothesize that distinct signaling pathways downstream of TrkB mediate the desirable (neuroprotective) and undesirable (epileptogenesis) consequences. We subsequently demonstrated that TrkB-mediated activation of phospholipase Cγ1 is required for epileptogenesis. Here we tested the hypothesis that the TrkB-Shc-Akt signaling pathway mediates the neuroprotective consequences of TrkB activation following SE. We studied measures of molecular signaling and cell death in a model of SE in mice of both sexes, including wild-type and TrkBShc/Shc mutant mice in which a point mutation (Y515F) of TrkB prevents the binding of Shc to activated TrkB kinase. Genetic disruption of TrkB-Shc signaling had no effect on severity of SE yet partially inhibited activation of the prosurvival adaptor protein Akt. Importantly, genetic disruption of TrkB-Shc signaling exacerbated hippocampal neuronal death induced by SE. We conclude that therapies targeting TrkB signaling for preventing epilepsy should spare TrkB-Shc-Akt signaling and thereby preserve the neuroprotective benefits.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is a common and devastating form of human epilepsy that lacks preventive therapies. Understanding the molecular signaling mechanisms underlying the development of TLE may identify novel therapeutic targets. BDNF signaling thru TrkB receptor tyrosine kinase is one molecular mechanism promoting TLE. We previously discovered that TrkB-mediated activation of phospholipase Cγ1 promotes epileptogenesis. Here we reveal that TrkB-mediated activation of Akt protects against hippocampal neuronal death in vivo following status epilepticus. These findings strengthen the evidence that desirable and undesirable consequences of status epilepticus-induced TrkB activation are mediated by distinct signaling pathways downstream of this receptor. These results provide a strong rationale for a novel therapeutic strategy selectively targeting individual signaling pathways downstream of TrkB for preventing epilepsy.",Incorporating Voluntary Medical Male Circumcision Into Traditional Circumcision Contexts: Experiences of a Local Consortium in Zimbabwe Collaborating With an Ethnic Group.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30926742,"Global health, science and practice",2019 04 03,"Employing voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC) within traditional settings may increase patient safety and help scale up male circumcision efforts in sub-Saharan Africa. In Zimbabwe, the VaRemba are among the few ethnic groups that practice traditional male circumcision, often in suboptimal hygienic environments. ZAZIC, a local consortium, and the Zimbabwe Ministry of Health and Child Care (MoHCC) established a successful, culturally sensitive partnership with the VaRemba to provide safe, standardized male circumcision procedures and reduce adverse events (AEs) during traditional male circumcision initiation camps. The foundation for the VaRemba Camp Collaborative (VCC) was established over a 4-year period, between 2013 and 2017, with support from a wide group of stakeholders. Initially, ZAZIC supported VaRemba traditional male circumcisions by providing key commodities and transport to help ensure patient safety. Subsequently, 2 male VaRemba nurses were trained in VMMC according to national MoHCC guidelines to enable medical male circumcision within the camp. To increase awareness and uptake of VMMC at the upcoming August-September 2017 camp, ZAZIC then worked closely with a trained team of circumcised VaRemba men to create demand for VMMC. Non-VaRemba ZAZIC doctors were granted permission by VaRemba leaders to provide oversight of VMMC procedures and postoperative treatment for all moderate and severe AEs within the camp setting. Of 672 male camp residents ages 10 and older, 657 (98%) chose VMMC. Only 3 (0.5%) moderate infections occurred among VMMC clients; all were promptly treated and healed well. Although the successful collaboration required many years of investment to build trust with community leaders and members, it ultimately resulted in a successful model that paired traditional circumcision practices with modern VMMC, suggesting potential for replicability in other similar sub-Saharan African communities."

Although many BVMOs have been reported, the development of highly efficient enzymes for use in industrial applications is desirable. In this work, we identified a BVMO from Rhodococcus pyridinivorans (BVMORp) with a high affinity toward aliphatic methyl ketones (Km < 3.0 μM). The enzyme was highly soluble and relatively stable, with a half-life of 23 h at 30°C and pH 7.5. The most effective substrate discovered so far is 2-hexanone (kcat = 2.1 s-1; Km = 1.5 μM). Furthermore, BVMORp exhibited excellent regioselectivity toward most aliphatic ketones, preferentially forming typical (i.e., normal) products. Using the newly identified BVMORp as the catalyst, a high concentration (26.0 g/liter; 200 mM) of methyl levulinate was completely converted to methyl 3-acetoxypropionate after 4 h, with a space-time yield of 5.4 g liter-1 h-1 Thus, BVMORp is a promising biocatalyst for the synthesis of 3-hydroxypropionate from readily available biobased levulinate to replace the conventional fermentation.IMPORTANCE BVMOs are emerging as a green alternative to traditional oxidants in the BV oxidation of ketones. Although many BVMOs are discovered and used in organic synthesis, few are really applied in industry, especially in the case of aliphatic ketones. Herein, a highly soluble and relatively stable monooxygenase from Rhodococcus pyridinivorans (BVMORp) was identified with high activity and excellent regioselectivity toward most aliphatic ketones. BVMORp possesses unusually high substrate loading during the catalysis of the oxidation of biobased methyl levulinate to 3-hydroxypropionic acid derivatives. This study indicates that the synthesis of 3-hydroxypropionate from readily available biobased levulinate by BVMORp-catalyzed oxidation holds great promise to replace traditional fermentation.",High Prevalence of Fluoroquinolone-Resistant Campylobacter Bacteria in Sheep and Increased Campylobacter Counts in the Bile and Gallbladders of Sheep Medicated with Tetracycline in Feed.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30926726,Applied and environmental microbiology,2019 06 10,"Campylobacter is a major foodborne pathogen in humans and a significant cause of abortion in sheep. Although ruminants are increasingly recognized as important reservoirs for Campylobacter species, limited information is available about the molecular epidemiology and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) profiles of sheep Campylobacter Here, we describe a two-trial study that examined Campylobacter profiles in sheep and determined whether in-feed tetracycline (TET) influenced the distribution and AMR profiles of Campylobacter Each trial involved 80 commercial sheep naturally infected with Campylobacter: 40 of these sheep were medicated with tetracycline in feed, while the other 40 received feed without antibiotics. Fecal and bile samples were collected for the isolation of Campylobacter The bacterial isolates were analyzed for antimicrobial susceptibility and genotypes. The results revealed that 87.0% and 61.3% of the fecal and bile samples were positive for Campylobacter (Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli), with no significant differences between the medicated and nonmedicated groups. All but one of the tested Campylobacter isolates were resistant to tetracycline. Although fluoroquinolone (FQ) resistance remained low in C. jejuni (1.7%), 95.0% of the C. coli isolates were resistant to FQ. Genotyping revealed that C. jejuni sequence type 2862 (ST2862) and C. coli ST902 were the predominant genotypes in the sheep. Feed medication with tetracycline did not affect the overall prevalence, species distribution, and AMR profiles of Campylobacter, but it did increase the total Campylobacter counts in bile and gallbladder. These findings identify predominant Campylobacter clones, reveal the high prevalence of FQ-resistant C. coli, and provide new insights into the epidemiology of Campylobacter in sheep.IMPORTANCECampylobacter is a major cause of foodborne illness in humans, and antibiotic-resistant Campylobacter is considered a serious threat to public health in the United States and worldwide. As a foodborne pathogen, Campylobacter commonly exists in the intestinal tract of ruminant animals, such as sheep and cattle. Results from this study reveal the predominant genotypes and high prevalence of tetracycline (TET) and fluoroquinolone (FQ) resistance in sheep Campylobacter The finding on fluoroquinolone resistance in sheep Campylobacter is unexpected, as this class of antibiotics is not used for sheep in the United States, and it may suggest the transmission of fluoroquinolone-resistant Campylobacter from cattle to sheep. Additionally, the results demonstrate that in-feed medication with tetracycline increases Campylobacter counts in gallbladders, suggesting that the antibiotic promotes Campylobacter colonization of the gallbladder. These findings provide new information on Campylobacter epidemiology in sheep, which may be useful for curbing the spread of antibiotic-resistant Campylobacter in animal reservoirs.",Assessing the Architecture of Drosophila mojavensis Locomotor Evolution with Bulk Segregant Analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30926724,"G3 (Bethesda, Md.)",2019 05 22,"Behavior is frequently predicted to be especially important for evolution in novel environments. If these predictions are accurate, there might be particular patterns of genetic architecture associated with recently diverged behaviors. Specifically, it has been predicted that behaviors linked to population divergence should be underpinned by a few genes of relatively large effect, compared to architectures of intrapopulation behavioral variation, which is considered to be highly polygenic. More mapping studies of behavioral variation between recently diverged populations are needed to continue assessing the generality of these predictions. Here, we used a bulk segregant mapping approach to dissect the genetic architecture of a locomotor trait that has evolved between two populations of the cactophilic fly Drosophila mojavensis We created an F8 mapping population of 1,500 individuals from advanced intercross lines and sequenced the 10% of individuals with the highest and lowest levels of locomotor activity. Using three alternative statistical approaches, we found strong evidence for two relatively large-effect QTL that is localized in a region homologous to a region of densely packed behavior loci in Drosophila melanogaster, suggesting that clustering of behavior genes may display relatively deep evolutionary conservation. Broadly, our data are most consistent with a polygenic architecture, though with several loci explaining a high proportion of variation in comparison to similar behavioral traits. We further note the presence of several antagonistic QTL linked to locomotion and discuss these results in light of theories regarding behavioral evolution and the effect size and direction of QTL for diverging traits in general.","Genome and Ontogenetic-Based Transcriptomic Analyses of the Flesh Fly, Sarcophaga bullata.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30926723,"G3 (Bethesda, Md.)",2019 06 10,"The flesh fly, Sarcophaga bullata, is a widely-used model for examining the physiology of insect diapause, development, stress tolerance, neurobiology, and host-parasitoid interactions.

We performed a systematic literature review (01/2007-12/2017), followed by modified Delphi method, to form questions, elicit expert opinions and reach consensus. Treatment in SLE aims at remission or low disease activity and prevention of flares. Hydroxychloroquine is recommended in all patients with lupus, at a dose not exceeding 5 mg/kg real body weight. During chronic maintenance treatment, glucocorticoids (GC) should be minimised to less than 7.5 mg/day (prednisone equivalent) and, when possible, withdrawn. Appropriate initiation of immunomodulatory agents (methotrexate, azathioprine, mycophenolate) can expedite the tapering/discontinuation of GC. In persistently active or flaring extrarenal disease, add-on belimumab should be considered; rituximab (RTX) may be considered in organ-threatening, refractory disease. Updated specific recommendations are also provided for cutaneous, neuropsychiatric, haematological and renal disease. Patients with SLE should be assessed for their antiphospholipid antibody status, infectious and cardiovascular diseases risk profile and preventative strategies be tailored accordingly. The updated recommendations provide physicians and patients with updated consensus guidance on the management of SLE, combining evidence-base and expert-opinion.","Importance of publishing research varies by doctors' career stage, specialty and location of work.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30926718,Postgraduate medical journal,2019 05 23,"To investigate whether publishing research is an important aspect of medical careers, and how it varies by specialty and rural or metropolitan location.",Low detection rate of advanced neoplasia within 5 years after polypectomy of small serrated adenoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30926717,Postgraduate medical journal,2019 05 23,Patients with small serrated adenomas (SAs) (<10 mm) often undergo surveillance colonoscopy before the routine recommended time.

Previous studies show that PTHrP-induced hypertrophic response in mesangial cells (MCs) and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in tubuloepithelial cells can be mediated by TGF-β1. In the present study, although long-term PHTrP (1-34) treatment increased the mRNA and protein level of TGF-β1 in primary rat MCs, fibronectin up-regulation occurred earlier, suggesting that fibronectin induction is independent of TGF-β1/Smad signaling. We thus evaluated the involvement of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling and found that nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase-derived reactive oxygen species mediates PTHrP (1-34)-induced Src kinase activation. Src phosphorylates EGFR at tyrosine 845 and then transactive EGFR. Subsequent PI3K activation mediates Akt and ERK1/2 activation. Akt and ERK1/2 discretely lead to excessive protein synthesis of fibronectin. Our study thus demonstrates the new role of PTHrP in fibronectin up-regulation for the first time in glomerular MCs.

The major effect of GALC deficiency is the accumulation of psychosine in the nervous system and widespread degeneration of oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells, causing rapid demyelination. The molecular mechanisms of Krabbe disease are not yet fully elucidated and a definite cure is still missing. Here we report the first in-depth characterization of the proteome of the Twitcher mouse, a spontaneous mouse model of Krabbe disease, to investigate the proteome changes in the Central and Peripheral Nervous System. We applied a TMT-based workflow to compare the proteomes of the corpus callosum, motor cortex and sciatic nerves of littermate homozygous Twitcher and wild-type mice. More than 400 protein groups exhibited differences in expression and included proteins involved in pathways that can be linked to Krabbe disease, such as inflammatory and defense response, lysosomal proteins accumulation, demyelination, reduced nervous system development and cell adhesion.

HIFs are critical molecular mediators of the physiological response to hypoxia but also regulate multiple steps of carcinogenesis including tumor progression and metastasis. Recent data support that sumoylation, the covalent attachment of the Small Ubiquitin-related MOdifier (SUMO) to proteins, is involved in the activation of the hypoxic response and the ensuing signaling cascade. To gain insights into differences of the SUMO1 and SUMO2/3 proteome of HeLa cells under normoxia and cells grown for 48 h under hypoxic conditions, we employed endogenous SUMO-immunoprecipitation in combination with quantitative mass spectrometry (SILAC). The group of proteins whose abundance was increased both in the total proteome and in the SUMO IPs from hypoxic conditions was enriched in enzymes linked to the hypoxic response. In contrast, proteins whose SUMOylation status changed without concomitant change in abundance were predominantly transcriptions factors or transcription regulators. Particularly interesting was transcription factor TFAP2A (Activating enhancer binding Protein 2 alpha), whose sumoylation decreased on hypoxia. TFAP2A is known to interact with HIF-1 and we provide evidence that deSUMOylation of TFAP2A enhances the transcriptional activity of HIF-1 under hypoxic conditions. Overall, these results support the notion that SUMO-regulated signaling pathways contribute at many distinct levels to the cellular response to low oxygen.",Photothermal-responsive nanosized hybrid polymersome as versatile therapeutics codelivery nanovehicle for effective tumor suppression.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30926671,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2019 04 27,"Effective cancer therapies often demand delivery of combinations of drugs to inhibit multidrug resistance through synergism, and the development of multifunctional nanovehicles with enhanced drug loading and delivery efficiency for combination therapy is currently a major challenge in nanotechnology. However, such combinations are more challenging to administer than single drugs and can require multipronged approaches to delivery. In addition to being stable and biodegradable, vehicles for such therapies must be compatible with both hydrophobic and hydrophilic drugs, and release drugs at sustained therapeutic levels. Here, we report synthesis of porous silicon nanoparticles conjugated with gold nanorods [composite nanoparticles (cNPs)] and encapsulate them within a hybrid polymersome using double-emulsion templates on a microfluidic chip to create a versatile nanovehicle. This nanovehicle has high loading capacities for both hydrophobic and hydrophilic drugs, and improves drug delivery efficiency by accumulating at the tumor after i.v. injection in mice. Importantly, a triple-drug combination suppresses breast tumors by 94% and 87% at total dosages of 5 and 2.5 mg/kg, respectively, through synergy. Moreover, the cNPs retain their photothermal properties, which can be used to significantly inhibit multidrug resistance upon near-infrared laser irradiation. Overall, this work shows that our nanovehicle has great potential as a drug codelivery nanoplatform for effective combination therapy that is adaptable to other cancer types and to molecular targets associated with disease progression.",Spontaneous driving forces give rise to protein-RNA condensates with coexisting phases and complex material properties.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30926670,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2019 04 27,"Phase separation of multivalent protein and RNA molecules underlies the biogenesis of biomolecular condensates such as membraneless organelles.

These studies yield a set of rules regarding homotypic and heterotypic interactions that are likely to be relevant for understanding the interplay between active and passive processes that control the formation of functional biomolecular condensates.",Precise small-molecule cleavage of an r(CUG) repeat expansion in a myotonic dystrophy mouse model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30926669,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2019 04 27,"Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is an incurable neuromuscular disorder caused by an expanded CTG repeat that is transcribed into r(CUG)exp The RNA repeat expansion sequesters regulatory proteins such as Muscleblind-like protein 1 (MBNL1), which causes pre-mRNA splicing defects. The disease-causing r(CUG)exp has been targeted by antisense oligonucleotides, CRISPR-based approaches, and RNA-targeting small molecules. Herein, we describe a designer small molecule, Cugamycin, that recognizes the structure of r(CUG)exp and cleaves it in both DM1 patient-derived myotubes and a DM1 mouse model, leaving short repeats of r(CUG) untouched. In contrast, oligonucleotides that recognize r(CUG) sequence rather than structure cleave both long and short r(CUG)-containing transcripts. Transcriptomic, histological, and phenotypic studies demonstrate that Cugamycin broadly and specifically relieves DM1-associated defects in vivo without detectable off-targets. Thus, small molecules that bind and cleave RNA have utility as lead chemical probes and medicines and can selectively target disease-causing RNA structures to broadly improve defects in preclinical animal models.",Small-molecule factor B inhibitor for the treatment of complement-mediated diseases.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30926668,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2019 04 26,"Dysregulation of the alternative complement pathway (AP) predisposes individuals to a number of diseases including paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome, and C3 glomerulopathy. Moreover, glomerular Ig deposits can lead to complement-driven nephropathies. Here we describe the discovery of a highly potent, reversible, and selective small-molecule inhibitor of factor B, a serine protease that drives the central amplification loop of the AP. Oral administration of the inhibitor prevents KRN-induced arthritis in mice and is effective upon prophylactic and therapeutic dosing in an experimental model of membranous nephropathy in rats. In addition, inhibition of factor B prevents complement activation in sera from C3 glomerulopathy patients and the hemolysis of human PNH erythrocytes. These data demonstrate the potential therapeutic value of using a factor B inhibitor for systemic treatment of complement-mediated diseases and provide a basis for its clinical development.",Hepatic posttranscriptional network comprised of CCR4-NOT deadenylase and FGF21 maintains systemic metabolic homeostasis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30926667,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2019 04 26,"Whole-body metabolic homeostasis is tightly controlled by hormone-like factors with systemic or paracrine effects that are derived from nonendocrine organs, including adipose tissue (adipokines) and liver (hepatokines). Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is a hormone-like protein, which is emerging as a major regulator of whole-body metabolism and has therapeutic potential for treating metabolic syndrome. However, the mechanisms that control FGF21 levels are not fully understood. Herein, we demonstrate that FGF21 production in the liver is regulated via a posttranscriptional network consisting of the CCR4-NOT deadenylase complex and RNA-binding protein tristetraprolin (TTP). In response to nutrient uptake, CCR4-NOT cooperates with TTP to degrade AU-rich mRNAs that encode pivotal metabolic regulators, including FGF21. Disruption of CCR4-NOT activity in the liver, by deletion of the catalytic subunit CNOT6L, increases serum FGF21 levels, which ameliorates diet-induced metabolic disorders and enhances energy expenditure without disrupting bone homeostasis. Taken together, our study describes a hepatic CCR4-NOT/FGF21 axis as a hitherto unrecognized systemic regulator of metabolism and suggests that hepatic CCR4-NOT may serve as a target for devising therapeutic strategies in metabolic syndrome and related morbidities.",Loss of postnatal quiescence of neural stem cells through mTOR activation upon genetic removal of cysteine string protein-α.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30926666,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2019 04 26,"Neural stem cells continuously generate newborn neurons that integrate into and modify neural circuitry in the adult hippocampus. The molecular mechanisms that regulate or perturb neural stem cell proliferation and differentiation, however, remain poorly understood. Here, we have found that mouse hippocampal radial glia-like (RGL) neural stem cells express the synaptic cochaperone cysteine string protein-α (CSP-α). Remarkably, in CSP-α knockout mice, RGL stem cells lose quiescence postnatally and enter into a high-proliferation regime that increases the production of neural intermediate progenitor cells, thereby exhausting the hippocampal neural stem cell pool. In cell culture, stem cells in hippocampal neurospheres display alterations in proliferation for which hyperactivation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway is the primary cause of neurogenesis deregulation in the absence of CSP-α. In addition, RGL cells lose quiescence upon specific conditional targeting of CSP-α in adult neural stem cells. Our findings demonstrate an unanticipated cell-autonomic and circuit-independent disruption of postnatal neurogenesis in the absence of CSP-α and highlight a direct or indirect CSP-α/mTOR signaling interaction that may underlie molecular mechanisms of brain dysfunction and neurodegeneration."

Methods: 76 men with mCSPC recruited from 2005-2011 underwent 18F-FDG PET/CT and were followed prospectively for THTF, defined as treatment change to chemotherapy or death. Patients who had not switched to chemotherapy were censored at the last follow-up date (median of 36 months, range 12-108 months). Cox regression analyses were performed to examine the association between PET/CT measurements: sum of SUVmax, maximum of SUVmax, and average of SUVmax of up to 10 of the most active lesions and THTF. Survival probabilities were based on the Kaplan-Meier method. Results: 43 patients had hormonal treatment failure and 8 died without documented treatment failure. Median THTF was 26.5 months (95% CI: 15.5-46.6 months). The THTF-free probability at 5 years was 35%+/-6%. In univariate analysis, all PET parameters including number of lesions were statistically significant for THTF. In a reduced multivariate model accounting for clinical variables, only sum of SUVmax (HR 1.01, 95% CI: 1.002-1.03, P = 0.024) and number of lesions (HR 1.18, 95% CI: 1.08-1.29, p<0.001) were independently associated with THTF. When sum of SUVmax was grouped into quartile ranges, there was significantly worse survival probability for patients in the 4th quartile range compared to the 1st, with a univariate hazard ratio of 6.2 (95% CI: 2.8-13.6, p<0.001). Conclusion: Sum of SUVmax and number of lesions derived from 18F-FDG PET/CT provides independent prognostic information on THTF in men with mCSPC.",18F-FDG PET/MRI for therapy response assessment of isolated limb perfusion in patients with soft-tissue sarcomas.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30926647,"Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",2019 04 19,"Purpose: To assess the diagnostic potential of simultaneously acquired 18F-FDG PET- and MR datasets for therapy response assessment of isolated limb perfusion (ILP) in patients with soft-tissue sarcomas (STS). Methods: A total of 45 patients with histopathologically verified STS were prospectively enrolled for an integrated 18F-FDG PET/MR examination before and after ILP. Therapy response was assessed based on different MR- and PET-derived morphological (RECIST, MR-adapted Choi criteria) and metabolic (PERCIST) criteria. In addition, a regression model was used combining relative changes of quantitative variables to predict treatment response under ILP. Histopathological results after subsequent tumor resection served as reference standard and patients were categorized as responders/non-responders based on the six-stage regression scale by Salzer-Kuntschik. Results: Histopathological analysis categorized 27 patients as therapy responders (Grade I-III) and 18 patients as non-responders (Grade IV-VI). Calculated sensitivities, specificities, positive and negative predictive values and diagnostic accuracies were 22%, 89%, 75%, 43% and 49% for RECIST, 70%, 44%, 66%, 50% and 60% for MRadapted Choi and 85%, 78%, 85%, 78% and 82% for the PERCIST criteria. ROC analysis revealed AUC values of 0.56 (RECIST), 0.57 (MR-adapted CHOI) and 0.82 (PERCIST), respectively. The combined regression model revealed higher values (AUC: 0.90) than for the stand-alone analysis, however, differences to metabolic parameters did not reached significance (p-value: 0.067). Conclusion: Our study demonstrates the superiority of 18F-FDG PET over MR-datasets for response assessment of STS under neoadjuvant ILP. In a clinical setting, MRI delivers valuable information for presurgical assessment. Therefore, combining 18FFDG PET and MRI data may enable a more reliable treatment planning and therapy monitoring of STS.",Preclinical pharmacokinetics and dosimetry studies of [124I/131I]-CLR1404 for treatment of pediatric solid tumors in murine xenograft models.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30926646,"Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",2019 03 30,"Pediatric cancer is the second leading cause of death for children between the ages of 5-14. For children diagnosed with metastatic or recurrent solid tumors, where the utility of external-beam radiotherapy is limited, the prognosis is particularly poor. The availability of tumor-targeting radiopharmaceuticals for molecular radiotherapy (MRT) has demonstrated improved outcomes in these patient populations, but options are nonexistent or limited for most pediatric solid tumors. 18-(p-iodophenyl) octadecyl phosphocholine (CLR1404) is a novel antitumor alkyl phospholipid ether analog that broadly targets cancer cells. In this study, we evaluated the in vivo pharmacokinetics of 124I-CLR1404 (CLR 124) and estimated theranostic dosimetry for 131I-CLR1404 (CLR 131) MRT in murine xenograft models of the pediatric solid tumors' neuroblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, and Ewing sarcoma. Methods: Tumor bearing mice were imaged with microPET/CT to evaluate the whole-body distribution of CLR 124 and, correcting for differences in radioactive decay, predict that of CLR 131. Image volumes representing CLR 131 provided input for Geant4 Monte Carlo simulations to calculate subject-specific tumor dosimetry for CLR 131 MRT. Pharmacokinetics for CLR 131 were extrapolated to adult and pediatric humans to estimate normal tissue dosimetry. In neuroblastoma, a direct comparison of CLR 124 with 124I-MIBG in an MIBG-avid model was performed. Results:In vivo pharmacokinetics of CLR 124 showed selective uptake and prolonged retention across all pediatric solid tumor models investigated. Subject-specific tumor dosimetry for CLR 131 MRT presents a correlative relationship with tumor-growth delay following CLR 131 MRT. Peak uptake of CLR 124 was, on average, 22% higher than 124I-MIBG in a MIBG-avid neuroblastoma model. Conclusion: CLR1404 is a suitable theranostic scaffold for dosimetry and therapy with potentially broad applicability in pediatric oncology. Given the ongoing clinical trials for CLR 131 in adults, this data supports the development of pediatric clinical trials and provides detailed dosimetry that may lead to improved MRT treatment planning.",Leptin Promotes Monosodium Urate Crystal-Induced Inflammation in Human and Murine Models of Gout.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30926645,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2019 04 23,"Gouty arthritis is an inflammatory disease that is triggered by abnormal uric acid metabolism, which is usually attributed to obesity, a risk factor of hyperuricemia and gout attack. A high level of leptin in plasma is a marker of individuals with obesity. Population studies show that leptin promotes obesity-related arthritis, such as osteoarthritis, but it is unknown whether leptin contributes to gouty arthritis, another form of obesity-related arthritis. Our present study showed that the levels of leptin and leptin receptor in patients with active gouty arthritis were elevated. Leptin facilitates the stimulation of human synoviocytes, mouse peritoneal macrophages, and HL-60 cells induced by monosodium urate, leading to higher levels of acute gout-related proinflammatory factors. Leptin obviously exacerbates the inflammation of monosodium urate-induced acute gouty arthritis in wild-type mice, whereas that in leptin-deficient C57BL6/Job/ob mice is markedly alleviated. The proinflammatory effect of leptin in acute gouty arthritis is partly mediated by mTORC1 signaling pathway. Our study reveals that leptin may serve as a novel prevention and treatment target in acute gouty arthritis.",Shifting Dynamics of Intestinal Macrophages during Simian Immunodeficiency Virus Infection in Adult Rhesus Macaques.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30926643,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2019 06 10,"The intestinal tract is a primary barrier to invading pathogens and contains immune cells, including lymphocytes and macrophages. We previously reported that CD163+CD206- (single-positive [SP]) interstitial macrophages of the lung are short-lived and succumb early to SIV infection. Conversely, CD163+CD206+ (double-positive [DP]) alveolar macrophages are long-lived, survive after SIV infection, and may contribute to the virus reservoir. This report characterizes analogous populations of macrophages in the intestinal tract of rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) with SIV/AIDS. By flow cytometry analysis, immunofluorescence staining, and confocal microscopy, CD163+CD206+ DP macrophages predominated in the lamina propria of uninfected animals, compared with CD163+CD206- SP macrophages, which predominated in the lamina propria in animals with SIV infection that were exhibiting AIDS. In submucosal areas, CD163+CD206+ DP macrophages predominated in both SIV-infected and uninfected macaques. Furthermore, BrdU-labeled CD163+CD206+ DP and CD163+CD206- SP macrophages recently arriving in the colon, which are both presumed to be shorter-lived, were observed to localize only in the lamina propria. Conversely, longer-lived CD163+CD206+ DP macrophages that retained dextran at least 2 mo after in vivo administration localized exclusively in the submucosa. This suggests that CD163+CD206+ DP intestinal macrophages of the lamina propria were destroyed after SIV infection and replaced by immature CD163+CD206- SP macrophages, whereas longer-lived CD163+CD206+ DP macrophages remained in the submucosa, supporting their potential role as an SIV/HIV tissue reservoir. Moreover, the DP macrophages in the submucosa, which differ from lamina propria DP macrophages, may be missed from pinch biopsy sampling, which may preclude detecting virus reservoirs for monitoring HIV cure.",Vemurafenib Inhibits Active PTK6 in PTEN-null Prostate Tumor Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30926642,Molecular cancer therapeutics,2019 05 02,"Protein tyrosine kinase 6 (PTK6, also called BRK) is overexpressed and activated in human prostate cancer. Loss of the tumor suppressor PTEN, a frequent event in prostate cancer, leads to PTK6 activation at the plasma membrane and its oncogenic signaling. The small molecule inhibitor vemurafenib, also known as PLX4032, and its tool analog PLX4720 were designed to inhibit constitutively active BRAF V600E, yet they also have potent effects against PTK6. Vemurafenib is used in the treatment of metastatic melanoma, but its efficacy in prostate cancer has not been assessed. When activated at the plasma membrane, PTK6 promotes signaling through FAK, EGFR, and ERK1/2, and we show this can be blocked by vemurafenib. In addition, PTK6-mediated cell growth, migration, and invasion are inhibited upon vemurafenib administration. Using a flank xenograft model, vemurafenib treatment reduced tumor burden. Using saturation transfer difference NMR and molecular docking, we demonstrate that vemurafenib binds in the active site of PTK6, inhibiting its activation. These structural studies provide insight into the PTK6-vemurafenib complex, which can be utilized for further refinement chemistry, whereas functional studies demonstrate that active PTK6 is a viable drug target in prostate cancer.",Targeting the IGF1R/PI3K/AKT Pathway Sensitizes Ewing Sarcoma to BET Bromodomain Inhibitors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30926641,Molecular cancer therapeutics,2019 05 04,"Inhibitors of the bromodomain and extra-terminal domain (BET) family proteins modulate EWS-FLI1 activities in Ewing sarcoma. However, the efficacy of BET inhibitors as a monotherapy was moderate and transient in preclinical models. The objective of this study was to identify the mechanisms mediating intrinsic resistance to BET inhibitors and develop more effective combination treatments for Ewing sarcoma. Using a panel of Ewing sarcoma cell lines and patient-derived xenograft lines (PDX), we demonstrated that IGF1R inhibitors synergistically increased sensitivities to BET inhibitors and induced potent apoptosis when combined with BET inhibitors. Constitutively activated AKT significantly protected Ewing sarcoma cells against BET inhibitors, suggesting that IGF1R regulates responsiveness to BET inhibitors mainly through the PI3K/AKT pathway. Although two Ewing sarcoma cell lines were resistant to IGF1R inhibitors, they retained synergistic response to a combination of BET inhibitors and mTOR inhibitors, suggesting that BET proteins, when IGF1R is not functional, cross-talk with its downstream molecules. Furthermore, the combination of a BET inhibitor and an IGF1R inhibitor induced potent and durable response in xenograft tumors, whereas either agent alone was less effective. Taken together, our results suggest that IGF1R and the downstream PI3K/AKT/mTOR kinase cascade mediate intrinsic resistance to BET inhibitors in Ewing sarcoma. These results provide the proof-of-concept for combining BET inhibitors with agents targeting the IGF1R pathway for treating advanced Ewing sarcoma.",GnRH-R-Targeted Lytic Peptide Sensitizes BRCA Wild-type Ovarian Cancer to PARP Inhibition.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30926640,Molecular cancer therapeutics,2019 05 04,"EP-100 is a synthetic lytic peptide that specifically targets the gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor on cancer cells. To extend the utility of EP-100, we aimed to identify effective combination therapies with EP-100 for ovarian cancer and explore potential mechanisms of this combination. A series of in vitro (MTT assay, immunoblot analysis, reverse-phase protein array, comet assay, and immunofluorescence staining) and in vivo experiments were carried out to determine the biological effects of EP-100 alone and in combination with standard-of-care drugs. EP-100 decreased the viability of ovarian cancer cells and reduced tumor growth in orthotopic mouse models. Of five standard drugs tested (cisplatin, paclitaxel, doxorubicin, topotecan, and olaparib), we found that the combination of EP-100 and olaparib was synergistic in ovarian cancer cell lines. Further experiments revealed that combined treatment of EP-100 and olaparib significantly increased the number of nuclear foci of phosphorylated histone H2AX. In addition, the extent of DNA damage was significantly increased after treatment with EP-100 and olaparib in comet assay. We performed reverse-phase protein array analyses and identified that the PI3K/AKT pathway was inhibited by EP-100, which we validated with in vitro experiments. In vivo experiment using the HeyA8 mouse model demonstrated that mice treated with EP-100 and olaparib had lower tumor weights (0.06 ± 0.13 g) than those treated with a vehicle (1.19 ± 1.09 g), EP-100 alone (0.62 ± 0.78 g), or olaparib alone (0.50 ± 0.63 g). Our findings indicate that combining EP-100 with olaparib is a promising therapeutic strategy for ovarian cancer.",RAC1b Overexpression Confers Resistance to Chemotherapy Treatment in Colorectal Cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30926638,Molecular cancer therapeutics,2019 05 02,"Resistance to chemotherapy represents a major limitation in the treatment of colorectal cancer. Novel strategies to circumvent resistance are critical to prolonging patient survival. Rac1b, a constitutively activated isoform of the small GTPase Rac1, is upregulated with disease progression and promotes cell proliferation and inhibits apoptosis by activation of NF-κB signaling. Here, we show that Rac1b overexpression correlates with cancer stage and confirmed Rac1b expression is associated with increased growth through enhancing NF-κB activity. Rac1b knockdown reduced cellular proliferation and reduced NF-κB activity. Surprisingly, Rac1b expression and NF-κB activity were upregulated in cells treated with chemotherapeutics, suggesting that Rac1b facilitates chemo-resistance through activation of NF-κB signaling. Knockdown of Rac1b or Rac inhibition increases the sensitivity of the cells to oxaliplatin. When used in combination, inhibition of Rac prevents the increase in NF-κB activity associated with chemotherapy treatment and increases the sensitivity of the cells to oxaliplatin. Although Rac inhibition or oxaliplatin treatment alone reduces the growth of colorectal cancer in vivo, combination therapy results in improved outcomes compared with single agents alone. We provide the first evidence that Rac1b expression confers resistance to chemotherapy in colorectal cancer. Additionally, we show that the use of a Rac inhibitor prevents chemoresistance by blocking activation of chemotherapy induced NF-κB signaling, providing a novel strategy to overcome resistance to chemotherapy in colorectal cancer.",Distribution and Activity of Lenvatinib in Brain Tumor Models of Human Anaplastic Thyroid Cancer Cells in Severe Combined Immune Deficient Mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30926637,Molecular cancer therapeutics,2019 05 02,"Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) is a rare but aggressive undifferentiated tumor that frequently metastasizes to the brain. The multiple kinase inhibitor lenvatinib and sorafenib have been approved to treat unresectable differentiated thyroid cancer, and lenvatinib has been approved in Japan to treat ATC. This study compared the effects of lenvatinib and sorafenib in mouse models of central nervous system metastases of ATC. Immunodeficient mice were inoculated with ATC cells, and the effects of lenvatinib and sorafenib were evaluated in subcutaneous- and brain metastasis-mimicking models. Drug distribution was evaluated by imaging tandem mass spectrometry (ITMS). Neither lenvatinib nor sorafenib affected the viability of ATC cell lines, whereas both inhibited VEGF secretion by ATC cells. In the subcutaneous tumor model, both lenvatinib and sorafenib inhibited growth and were associated with reduced tumor microvessel density. In the brain metastasis-mimicking model, lenvatinib, but not sorafenib, inhibited the growth of ATC cells and reduced microvessel density in brain lesions. ITMS showed that lenvatinib was well-distributed in both subcutaneous and brain lesions, whereas the distribution of sorafenib was lower in brain than in subcutaneous lesions. These results demonstrate that lenvatinib is well-distributed in mouse models of ATC, and inhibited the growth of ATC brain lesions predominantly by inhibiting angiogenesis, suggesting that lenvatinib is highly potent against ATC brain metastases."

Repression results from a high nucleosome occupancy and epigenetic silencing by cellular factors such as the Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) and DNA methyltransferases that, respectively, introduce repressive histone marks and DNA methylation. The viral transcription factor BZLF1 acts as a molecular switch to induce transition from the latent to the lytic or productive phase of EBV's life cycle. It is unknown how BZLF1 can bind to the epigenetically silenced viral DNA and whether it directly reactivates the viral genome through chromatin remodeling. We addressed these fundamental questions and found that BZLF1 binds to nucleosomal DNA motifs both in vivo and in vitro. BZLF1 co-precipitates with cellular chromatin remodeler ATPases, and the knock-down of one of them, INO80, impaired lytic reactivation and virus synthesis. In Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin-seq experiments, non-accessible chromatin opens up locally when BZLF1 binds to its cognate sequence motifs in viral DNA. We conclude that BZLF1 reactivates the EBV genome by directly binding to silenced chromatin and recruiting cellular chromatin-remodeling enzymes, which implement a permissive state for lytic viral transcription. BZLF1 shares this mode of action with a limited number of cellular pioneer factors, which are instrumental in transcriptional activation, differentiation, and reprogramming in all eukaryotic cells.",Recombination By-products Contribute to RAG-Mediated Chromosomal Alterations.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30926616,Cancer discovery,2019 05 02,RAG recombinase reaction by-product complexes trigger genome-wide DNA breaks.,Delta-like Protein 3 Is a Target in Neuroendocrine Prostate Cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30926615,Cancer discovery,2019 05 02,Expression of delta-like protein 3 (DLL3) is a defining feature of neuroendocrine prostate cancer.,MYCN Recruits BRCA1 to Limit Accumulation of Stalled RNA Polymerase.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30926614,Cancer discovery,2019 05 02,MYCN recruits BRCA1 to activated gene promoters to suppress accumulation of stalled RNAPII.,KRASG12D Promotes Immunosuppression in Colorectal Cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30926613,Cancer discovery,2019 05 02,KRASG12D drives MDSC-mediated resistance to immune checkpoint blockade in patients with colorectal cancer.,CXCL12 Has Niche-Specific Roles in Leukemia Stem Cell Function.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30926612,Cancer discovery,2019 05 02,MSC-expressed CXCL12 promotes LSC quiescence and promotes BCR-ABL inhibitor resistance.,Analysis of 100 high-coverage genomes from a pedigreed captive baboon colony.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30926611,Genome research,2019 05 19,"Baboons (genus Papio) are broadly studied in the wild and in captivity. They are widely used as a nonhuman primate model for biomedical studies, and the Southwest National Primate Research Center (SNPRC) at Texas Biomedical Research Institute has maintained a large captive baboon colony for more than 50 yr. Unlike other model organisms, however, the genomic resources for baboons are severely lacking. This has hindered the progress of studies using baboons as a model for basic biology or human disease. Here, we describe a data set of 100 high-coverage whole-genome sequences obtained from the mixed colony of olive (P. anubis) and yellow (P. cynocephalus) baboons housed at the SNPRC. These data provide a comprehensive catalog of common genetic variation in baboons, as well as a fine-scale genetic map. We show how the data can be used to learn about ancestry and admixture and to correct errors in the colony records. Finally, we investigated the consequences of inbreeding within the SNPRC colony and found clear evidence for increased rates of infant mortality and increased homozygosity of putatively deleterious alleles in inbred individuals.",Biochemical characterization of the Lassa virus L protein.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30926610,The Journal of biological chemistry,2019 05 22,"The L protein of arena- and bunyaviruses is structurally and functionally related to the orthomyxovirus polymerase complex. It plays a central role in the viral life cycle, as it replicates the virus genome and generates viral mRNA via a cap-snatching mechanism. Here, we aimed to biochemically characterize the L protein of Lassa virus, a human-pathogenic arenavirus endemic in West Africa. Full-length 250-kDa L protein was expressed using a baculovirus expression system. A low-resolution structure calculated from small-angle X-ray scattering data revealed a conformation similar to that in the crystal structure of the orthomyxovirus polymerase complex. Although the L protein did not exhibit cap-snatching endonuclease activity, it synthesized RNA in vitro RNA polymerization required manganese rather than magnesium ions, was independent of nucleotide primers, and was inhibited by viral Z protein. Maximum activity was mediated by double-stranded promoter sequences with a minimum length of 17 nucleotides, containing a nontemplated 5'-G overhang, as in the natural genome context, as well as the naturally occurring base mismatches between the complementary promoter strands. Experiments with various short primers revealed the presence of two replication initiation sites at the template strand and evidence for primer translocation as proposed by the prime-and-realign hypothesis.

The related enzyme CYP3A5 is also expressed in adult liver and has broader age and tissue distributions. However, CYP3A5 expression is low in most Caucasians because of the prevalence of an allele that leads to an incorrectly spliced mRNA and premature termination of translation. When expressed, CYP3A5 expands metabolic capabilities and can augment CYP3A4-mediated drug metabolism, thereby reducing drug efficacy and potentially requiring dose adjustments. The extensive role of CYP3A4 in drug metabolism reflects in part the plasticity of the substrate-free enzyme to enlarge its active site and accommodate very large substrates. We have previously shown that the structure of the CYP3A5-ritonavir complex differs substantially from that of the CYP3A4-ritonavir complex. To better understand whether these differences are conserved in other CYP3A5 structures and how they relate to differential plasticity, we determined the X-ray crystallographic structure of the CYP3A5 substrate-free complex to 2.20 Å resolution. We observed that this structure exhibits a much larger active site than substrate-free CYP3A4 and displays an open substrate access channel. This reflected in part a lower trajectory of the helix F-F' connector in CYP3A4 and more extensive π-CH interactions between phenylalanine residues forming the roof of the active-site cavity than in CYP3A5. Comparison with the CYP3A5-ritonavir complex confirmed conserved CYP3A5 structural features and indicated differences in plasticity between CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 that favor alternative ritonavir conformations.",Substrate specificity of the pyrophosphohydrolase LpxH determines the asymmetry of Bordetella pertussis lipid A.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30926608,The Journal of biological chemistry,2019 05 22,"Lipopolysaccharides are anchored to the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria by a hydrophobic moiety known as lipid A, which potently activates the host innate immune response. Lipid A of Bordetella pertussis, the causative agent of whooping cough, displays unusual structural asymmetry with respect to the length of the acyl chains at the 3 and 3' positions, which are 3OH-C10 and 3OH-C14 chains, respectively. Both chains are attached by the acyltransferase LpxA, the first enzyme in the lipid A biosynthesis pathway, which, in B. pertussis, has limited chain length specificity. However, this only partially explains the strict asymmetry of lipid A. In attempts to modulate the endotoxicity of B. pertussis lipid A, here we expressed the gene encoding LpxA from Neisseria meningitidis, which specifically attaches 3OH-C12 chains, in B. pertussis This expression was lethal, suggesting that one of the downstream enzymes in the lipid A biosynthesis pathway in B. pertussis cannot handle precursors with a 3OH-C12 chain. We considered that the UDP-diacylglucosamine pyrophosphohydrolase LpxH could be responsible for this defect as well as for the asymmetry of B. pertussis lipid A. Expression of meningococcal LpxH in B. pertussis indeed resulted in new symmetric lipid A species with 3OH-C10 or 3OH-C14 chains at both the 3 and 3' positions, as revealed by MS analysis. Furthermore, co-expression of meningococcal lpxH and lpxA resulted in viable cells that incorporated 3OH-C12 chains in B. pertussis lipid A. We conclude that the asymmetry of B. pertussis lipid A is determined by the acyl chain length specificity of LpxH."

However, their molecular and cellular mode of action is still unclear. While a first model - referred to as the pore forming model - is the most widely accepted scenario, a second model proposed that toxins could trigger an Mg2+-dependent intracellular signalling pathway leading to cell death. Although Cry1Ca has been shown to form ionic pores in the plasma membrane leading to cell swelling and death, we investigated the existence of other cellular or molecular events involved in Cry1Ca toxicity. The Sf9 insect cell line, derived from Spodoptera frugiperda, is highly and specifically sensitive to Cry1Ca. Through a selection program we developed various levels of laboratory-evolved Cry1Ca-resistant Sf9 cell lines. Using a specific S. frugiperda microarray we performed a comparative transcriptomic analysis between sensitive and resistant cells and revealed genes differentially expressed in resistant cells and related to cation-dependent signalling pathways. Ion chelators protected sensitive cells from Cry1Ca toxicity suggesting the necessity of both Ca2+ and/or Mg2+ for toxin action. Selected cells were highly resistant to Cry1Ca while toxin binding onto their plasma membrane was not affected. This suggested a resistance mechanism different from the classical 'loss of toxin binding'. We observed a correlation between Cry1Ca cytotoxicity and the increase of intracellular cAMP levels. Indeed, Sf9 sensitive cells produced high levels of cAMP upon toxin stimulation, while Sf9 resistant cells were unable to increase their intracellular cAMP. Together, these results provide new information about the mechanism of Cry1Ca toxicity and clues to potential resistance factors yet to discover.",How I manage anticoagulant therapy in older individuals with atrial fibrillation or venous thromboembolism.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30926593,Blood,2019 05 24,"Anticoagulant therapy is the most effective strategy to prevent arterial and venous thromboembolism, but treating older individuals is challenging, because increasing age, comorbidities, and polypharmacy increase the risk of both thrombosis and bleeding. Warfarin and non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants are underused and often underdosed in the prevention of stroke in older patients with atrial fibrillation because of concerns about the risk of bleeding. Poor adherence to anticoagulant therapy is also an issue for older patients with atrial fibrillation and those at risk of recurrent pulmonary embolism. In this review, we present 5 clinical cases to illustrate common challenges with anticoagulant use in older patients and discuss our approach to institute safe and effective antithrombotic therapy.",PTENα promotes neutrophil chemotaxis through regulation of cell deformability.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30926592,Blood,2019 05 10,"Neutrophils are a major component of immune defense and are recruited through neutrophil chemotaxis in response to invading pathogens. However, the molecular mechanism that controls neutrophil chemotaxis remains unclear. Here, we report that PTENα, the first isoform identified in the PTEN family, regulates neutrophil deformability and promotes chemotaxis of neutrophils. A high level of PTENα is detected in neutrophils and lymphoreticular tissues. Homozygous deletion of PTENα impairs chemoattractant-induced migration of neutrophils. We show that PTENα physically interacts with cell membrane cross-linker moesin through its FERM domain and dephosphorylates moesin at Thr558, which disrupts the association of filamentous actin with the plasma membrane and subsequently induces morphologic changes in neutrophil pseudopodia. These results demonstrate that PTENα acts as a phosphatase of moesin and modulates neutrophil-mediated host immune defense. We propose that PTENα signaling is a potential target for the treatment of infections and immune diseases.",Tear cytokine profiling in patients with superior limbic keratoconjunctivitis who underwent medical treatment or in conjunction with surgical management.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30926588,The British journal of ophthalmology,2019 03 30,To determine the correlation between superior limbic keratoconjunctivitis (SLK) and selected tear cytokines and to evaluate the efficacy of these cytokines in monitoring the response of patients with SLK to either medical treatment alone or in combination with conjunctival resection.,Falling admissions to hospital with febrile seizures in the UK.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30926585,Archives of disease in childhood,2019 03 30,There was a reduction in febrile seizure admissions in Scotland after 2008.

The extent to which such unions affect identity-by-descent (IBD) genomic sharing between rather than within individuals in a population, however, is not immediately evident from within-individual ROH levels. Using the fact that the time to the most recent common ancestor [Formula: see text] for a pair of genomes at a specific locus is inversely related to the extent of IBD sharing between the genomes in the neighborhood of the locus, we study IBD sharing for a pair of genomes sampled either within the same individual or in different individuals. We develop a coalescent model for a set of mating pairs in a diploid population, treating the fraction of consanguineous unions as a parameter. Considering mating models that include unions between sibs, first cousins, and nth cousins, we determine the effect of the consanguinity rate on the mean [Formula: see text] for pairs of lineages sampled either within the same individual or in different individuals. The results indicate that consanguinity not only increases ROH sharing between the two genomes within an individual, it also increases IBD sharing between individuals in the population, the magnitude of the effect increasing with the kinship coefficient of the type of consanguineous union. Considering computations of ROH and between-individual IBD in Jewish populations whose consanguinity rates have been estimated from demographic data, we find that, in accord with the theoretical results, increases in consanguinity and ROH levels inflate levels of IBD sharing between individuals in a population. The results contribute more generally to the interpretation of runs of homozygosity, IBD sharing between individuals, and the relationship between ROH and IBD.",Hepatic Lysosomal iNOS Activity Impairs Autophagy in Obesity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30926581,Cellular and molecular gastroenterology and hepatology,2019 06 10,"The lysosome is an acidic organelle that is important for maintaining cellular and metabolic homeostasis in hepatocytes. Lysosomal dysfunction and chronic inflammation coexist, and both contribute to obesity-associated hepatic insulin resistance. However, in the context of obesity, the interplay between inflammatory signals and hepatic lysosomal function remains largely unknown. Inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) is a hallmark for inflammation, and is activated in obesity. The aim of this study is to understand the molecular link between iNOS-mediated lysosomal nitric oxide (NO) production, hepatic lysosomal function, and autophagy in the context of obesity-associated insulin resistance.",Development of osteopromotive poly (octamethylene citrate glycerophosphate) for enhanced bone regeneration.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30926580,Acta biomaterialia,2019 04 16,"The design and development of bioactive materials that are inherently conducive for osteointegration and bone regeneration with tunable mechanical properties and degradation remains a challenge. Herein, we report the development of a new class of citrate-based materials with glycerophosphate salts, β-glycerophosphate disodium (β-GP-Na) and glycerophosphate calcium (GP-Ca), incorporated through a simple and convenient one-pot condensation reaction, which might address the above challenge in the search of suitable orthopedic biomaterials. Tensile strength of the resultant poly (octamethylene citrate glycerophosphate), POC-βGP-Na and POC-GP-Ca, was as high as 28.2 ± 2.44  MPa and 22.76 ± 1.06  MPa, respectively. The initial modulus ranged from 5.28 ± 0.56  MPa to 256.44 ± 22.88  MPa. The mechanical properties and degradation rate of POC-GP could be controlled by varying the type of salts, and the feeding ratio of salts introduced. Particularly, POC-GP-Ca demonstrated better cytocompatibility and the corresponding composite POC-GP-Ca/hydroxyapatite (HA) also elicited improved osteogenic differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) in vitro, as compared to POC-βGP-Na/HA and POC/HA. The superior in-vivo performance of POC-GP-Ca/HA microparticle scaffolds in promoting bone regeneration over POC-βGP-Na/HA and POC/HA was further confirmed in a rabbit femoral condyle defect model. Taken together, the tunability of mechanical properties and degradation rates, together with the osteopromotive nature of POC-GP polymers make these materials, especially POC-GP-Ca well suited for bone tissue engineering applications. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: The design and development of bioactive materials that are inherently conducive for osteointegration and bone regeneration with tunable mechanical properties and degradation remains a challenge.

The resultant POC-GP polymers showed significantly improved mechanical property and tunable degradation rate. Within the formulation investigated, POC-GPCa/HA composite further demonstrated better bioactivity in favoring osteogenic differentiation of hMSCs in vitro and promoted bone regeneration in rabbit femoral condyle defects. The development of POC-GP expands the repertoire of the well-recognized citrate-based biomaterials to meet the ever-increasing needs for functional biomaterials in tissue engineering and other biomedical applications.",High-speed X-ray visualization of dynamic crack initiation and propagation in bone.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30926579,Acta biomaterialia,2019 05 13,"The initiation and propagation of physiological cracks in porcine cortical and cancellous bone under high rate loading were visualized using high-speed synchrotron X-ray phase-contrast imaging (PCI) to characterize their fracture behaviors under dynamic loading conditions. A modified Kolsky compression bar was used to apply dynamic three-point flexural loadings on notched specimens and images of the fracture processes were recorded using a synchronized high-speed synchrotron X-ray imaging set-up. Three-dimensional synchrotron X-ray tomography was conducted to examine the initial microstructure of the bone before high-rate experiments. The experimental results showed that the locations of fracture initiations were not significantly different between the two types of bone. However, the crack velocities in cortical bone were higher than in cancellous bone. Crack deflections at osteonal cement lines, a prime toughening mechanism in bone at low rates, were observed in the cortical bone under dynamic loading in this study. Fracture toughening mechanisms, such as uncracked ligament bridging and bridging in crack wake were also observed for the two types of bone. The results also revealed that the fracture toughness of cortical bone was higher than cancellous bone. The crack was deflected to some extent at osteon cement line in cortical bone instead of comparatively penetrating straight through the microstructures in cancellous bone. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Fracture toughness is with great importance to study for crack risk prediction in bone. For those cracks in bone, most of them are associated with impact events, such as sport accidents. Consequently, we visualized, in real-time, the entire processes of dynamic fractures in notched cortical bone and cancellous bone specimens using synchrotron X-ray phase contrast imaging. The onset location of crack initiation was found independent on the bone type. We also found that, although the extent was diminished, crack deflections at osteon cement lines, a major toughening mechanism in transversely orientated cortical bone at quasi-static rate, were still played a role in resisting cracking in dynamically loaded specimen. These finding help researchers to understand the dynamic fracture behaviors in bone.",Sirtuin 6 mediated stem cell cardiomyogenesis on protein coated nanofibrous scaffolds.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30926577,"Nanomedicine : nanotechnology, biology, and medicine",2019 05 06,"The cellular niche provides combination of biomolecular and biophysical cues to control stem cell fate. Three-dimensional (3D) aligned nanofibrous scaffolds can effectively augment stem cell cardiomyogenesis. This work aims to understand the role of biomolecular signals from extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins and leverage them to further promote cardiomyogenesis on nanofibrous scaffolds. Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) were cultured on 3D aligned polycaprolactone scaffolds coated with different ECM proteins. Among multiple coatings tested, collagen coated fibers were most effective in promoting cardiomyogenesis as determined from increased expression of cardiac biomarkers and intracellular calcium flux. At molecular level, enhanced differentiation on collagen coated fibers was associated with an increased level of sirtuin 6 (SIRT6). Depletion of SIRT6 using siRNA attenuated the differentiation process through activation of Wnt signaling pathway. This study, thus, demonstrates that protein coated scaffolds can augment cardiomyogenic differentiation of stem cells through a combination of topographical and biomolecular signals."

However, currently, there are no suitable candidates. The thrombopoietin receptor (TPOR) agonist romiplostim (RP) is a therapeutic agent for immune thrombocytopenia and has potential to respond to such victims. Here, we show that RP administration in mice exposed to lethal-dose radiation leads not only to the promotion of haematopoiesis in multiple organs, including the lungs but also a reduction in damage to organs and cells. RP also causes a rapid increase in the number of mesenchymal stem cells in the spleen. In addition, RP suppresses the expression of several miRNAs involved in radiation-induced leukemogenesis, suggesting the presence of targets other than TPOR. Among the currently approved pharmaceutical drugs, RP is the most suitable candidate for victims exposed to high-dose ionizing radiation.",Mitochondria and oxidative stress in ovarian endometriosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30926565,Free radical biology & medicine,2019 04 29,"Endometriosis is associated with inflammatory reaction, and reactive oxidative species (ROS) are highly pro-inflammatory factors. Mitochondria are responsible for the production of ROS and energy. However, little is known about how mitochondria regulate ROS generation and energy metabolism in endometriosis. In our study, we investigated mitochondrial structure and function of ectopic endometrial stromal cells (ESCs) in ovarian endometriosis. We found mitochondria in ectopic ESCs generated more ROS and energy than controlled groups. Mitochondrial superoxide dismutase (SOD2), as an antioxidant enzyme, was found highly expressed in ectopic endometrium compared with normal endometrium. Due to its antioxidant role, SOD2 promoted the development of endometriosis by maintaining functional mitochondria to support high energetic metabolism of ectopic ESCs. We also showed that SOD2 promoted cell proliferation and migration in ovarian endometriosis. Inhibiting SOD2 expression reduced proliferation and migration of ectopic ESCS, and increased cell apoptosis. Therefore, understanding the role of mitochondrial dysfunction and SOD2 in ovarian endometriosis may provide new strategies to treat this disease.",Vitamin C increases DNA breaks and suppresses DNA damage-independent activation of ATM by bleomycin.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30926564,Free radical biology & medicine,2019 05 02,"Bleomycin is a redox-active drug with anticancer and other clinical applications. It is also frequently used as a tool in fundamental research on cellular responses to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). A conversion of bleomycin into its DNA-breaking form requires Fe, one-electron donors and O2. Here, we examined how a major biological antioxidant ascorbate (reduced vitamin C), which is practically absent in standard cell culture, impacts cellular responses to bleomycin. We found that restoration of physiological levels of vitamin C in human cancer cells increased their killing by bleomycin in 2D cultures and 3D tumor spheroids. Higher cytotoxicity of bleomycin occurred in cells with normal and shRNA-depleted p53. Cellular vitamin C enhanced the ability of bleomycin by produce DSBs, which was established by direct measurements of these lesions in three cell lines. Vitamin C-restored cancer cells also showed a higher sensitivity to killing by low-dose bleomycin in combination with inhibitors of DSB repair-activating ATM or DNA-PK kinases. The presence of ascorbate in bleomycin-treated cells suppressed a DSB-independent activation of the ATM-CHK2 axis by blocking superoxide radical. In vitro studies detected a greatly superior ability of ascorbate over other cellular reducers to catalyze DSB formation by bleomycin. Ascorbate was faster than other antioxidants in promoting two steps in activation of bleomycin. Our results demonstrate strong activation effects of vitamin C on bleomycin, shifting its toxicity further toward DNA damage and making it more sensitive to manipulations of DNA repair.",Frailty index as a biomarker of lifespan and healthspan: Focus on pharmacological interventions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30926563,Mechanisms of ageing and development,2019 06 03,"Although survival has been the focus of aging research for many years, the field is rapidly evolving towards incorporating healthspan and health indices in studies that explore aging-related outcomes. Frailty is one such measure that is tightly correlated with human aging. Several frailty measures have been developed that focus on phenotypes of aging, including physical, cognitive and metabolic health that define healthspan. The extent at which cumulative deficits associated with frailty predict functional characteristics of healthy aging and longevity is currently unknown. A growing consensus for the use of animal models has emerged to evaluate a composite measure of frailty that provides a translational basis to understanding human frailty. In this review, we will focus on the impact of several anti-aging interventions, some of which have been characterized as caloric restriction (CR) mimetics such as metformin, rapamycin, and resveratrol as well as more novel approaches that are emerging in the field - nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide precursors, small molecule activators of sirtuins, and senolytics - on a number of frailty measurements associated with aging-related outcomes in mice and discuss the translatability of such measures to human frailty.",The impact of physical activity and sedentary behaviors on frailty levels.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30926562,Mechanisms of ageing and development,2019 06 03,"Heterogeneity in aging can be explained by frailty. Lifestyle behaviors such as physical activity can help manage frailty levels. Conversely, sedentary behaviours are associated with frailty independently of physical activity. Here, we summarize epidemiological and clinical trial evidence concerning the impact of physical activity and sedentary behaviors on frailty levels. We also analysed the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data to describe physical activity and sedentary behavior accumulation patterns across frailty levels and their impact on mortality risk. The few prospective and intervention studies demonstrate that higher physical activity levels are associated with a lower incidence of frailty. There are no interventions published which limit sedentary behaviors to manage frailty. Using the NHANES data we demonstrate that individuals are less likely to meet physical activity guidelines and are more likely to accumulate sedentary time in prolonged bouts. Prolonged sedentary bouts and total sedentary time were associated with a higher mortality risk in frail individuals but not in the fit group. Non-bouted sedentary time was not associated with mortality risk. Our review and novel data suggest that there is a need for more intervention studies which focus on increasing physical activity or minimizing sedentary time to manage frailty levels.",GLP-1-based therapies to boost autophagy in cardiometabolic patients: From experimental evidence to clinical trials.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30926561,Vascular pharmacology,2019 04 10,"Obesity has many deleterious effects on the cardiovascular system, mediated by changes in insulin sensitivity, dyslipidaemia, oxidative stress and inflammation. Current therapies mainly focus on caloric intake suppression and bariatric surgery, however the efficacy of these approaches remains elusive as most patients regain their body weight within the next 5 years. A better understanding of the pathophysiology of obesity is of paramount importance for the development of new therapeutic strategies to prevent vascular complications. Autophagy has emerged as key self-degrading process responsible for the maintenance of cellular homeostasis. Defects in autophagy homeostasis are implicated in metabolic disorders, including obesity, insulin resistance, diabetes mellitus and atherosclerosis. Most importantly, autophagy regulates animal lifespan. Albeit ample preclinical evidence supports the therapeutic promise of autophagy modulators for the treatment of obesity and metabolic diseases, the clinical efficacy of pharmacological modulation of autophagy remains to be proven. Recent work has shown that GLP-1-based therapeutic approaches may positively affect autophagy in perivascular adipose tissue, thus improving obesity-related endothelial dysfunction. In the present review we discuss current evidence on the role of autophagy in obesity, with a specific focus on DPP-4 inhibitors (DPP-4i) and GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA) as modulators of this process. Experimental evidence on GLP-1-based approaches is critically discussed in light of recent clinical trials with DPP-4i and GLP-1 RA.",A deep learning approach to estimation of subject-level bias and variance in high angular resolution diffusion imaging.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30926560,Magnetic resonance imaging,2019 06 02,"The ability to evaluate empirical diffusion MRI acquisitions for quality and to correct the resulting imaging metrics allows for improved inference and increased replicability.

This paper aims to provide methods for estimating GFA, bias of GFA and standard deviation of GFA quickly and accurately. In order to provide a method for bias and variance estimation that can return results faster than the previously studied statistical techniques, three deep, fully-connected neural networks are developed for GFA, bias of GFA, and standard deviation of GFA. The results of these networks are compared to the observed values of the metrics as well as those fit from the statistical techniques (i.e. Simulation Extrapolation (SIMEX) for bias estimation and wild bootstrap for variance estimation). Our GFA network provides predictions that are closer to the true GFA values than a Q-ball fit of the observed data (root-mean-square error (RMSE) 0.0077 vs 0.0082, p < .001). The bias network also shows statistically significant improvement in comparison to the SIMEX-estimated error of GFA (RMSE 0.0071 vs. 0.01, p < .001).",Nonsurviving Patients with Severe Traumatic Brain Injury Have Maintained High Serum sCD40L Levels.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30926559,World neurosurgery,2019 04 21,Soluble cluster of differentiation 40 ligand (sCD40L) is a member of the tumor necrosis factor family with proinflamatory and procoagulant effects.

Morphological analysis of the specimens revealed characteristics resembling the sub-species Plesiochorus cymbiformis elongatus rather than the recently synonymised Plesiochorus cymbiformis. Molecular phylogenetic analysis of the ITS2 region also showed that P. c. elongatus was distinct from P. cymbiformis and related taxa. Further analysis of the ITS2 revealed substantial differentiation between P. cymbiformis from the USA and Brazil and the newly sequenced P. c. elongatus from Brazil, while a previously unspecified Plesiochorus sp. from the USA closely related to the novel Brazilian P. c. elongatus was reconciled as a USA isolate of P. c. elongatus. Based on both the morphological and molecular data it is suggested that P. c. elongatus should be referred to as Plesiochorus elongatus and be considered as the second species in the genus.",A case report of human gastrodiscoidiasis in Nepal.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30926537,Parasitology international,2019 05 15,"Gastrodiscoidiasis is a snail-transmitted zoonotic infection caused by the digenean trematode Gastrodiscoides hominis, which is the only species in the genus Gastrodiscoides infecting humans. We report a case of human gastrodiscoidiasis in a 66 years-old Nepali man without history of travels outside of Nepal who was admitted in the hospital with pain in upper abdomen for 4 months with history of passage of black-tarry stools, anemia and eosinophilia. During upper endoscopy a living trematode worm was seen in the antrum of the stomach. After isolation, the worm was identified morphologically as Gastrodiscoides hominis. Stool analysis of the patient revealed eggs of this parasite. The cause of the infection appeared to be related to the habit of the patient to eat raw watercress. This is the first report of human infection with Gastrodiscoides hominis in Nepal. However, the burden of this foodborne trematode infection in Nepal might be underestimated.",A proteomic analysis of Caenorhabditis elegans mitochondria during bacterial infection.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30926536,Mitochondrion,2019 05 18,"Mitochondria are involved in a variety of cellular metabolic processes and their functions are regulated by intrinsic and extrinsic stimuli. Recent studies have revealed functional diversity and importance of mitochondria in many cellular processes, including the innate immune response. This study evaluated the specific response and proteomic changes in host Caenorhabditis elegans mitochondria during Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 infection. We performed an inclusive approach to determine the C. elegans mitochondria proteome. The protein fractions of mitochondria were analysed by tandem LC-MS/MS, 129 differentially regulated proteins were identified, indicating an involvement of various mitochondrial processes. The several known components of the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) machinery, the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt) and stable mitochondria-encoded proteins were found to be differentially expressed. Our results in-depth provide new horizons for mitochondria-associated protein functions and the classification of mitochondrial diseases during host-pathogen interaction.",The first direct activity assay for the mitochondrial protease OMA1.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30926535,Mitochondrion,2019 05 02,"Mitochondria continually undergo fission and fusion which allow mitochondria to rapidly change their shape, size, and function throughout the cell life cycle. OMA1, a zinc metalloproteinase enzyme, is a key regulator of the mitochondrial fusion machinery. The paucity of information regarding OMA1 regulation and function largely stems from the fact that there is no direct method to quantitatively measure its activity. Using a fluorescence-based reporter assay, we developed a sensitive method to measure OMA1 enzymatic activity in whole cell lysates."
