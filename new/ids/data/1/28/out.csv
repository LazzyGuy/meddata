The killer phenotype is widespread among yeast and about 100 yeast killer species have been described to date. The spectrum of action of the killer toxins they produce targets spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms. Thus, they have potential as natural antimicrobials in food and for biological control of plant pathogens, as well as therapeutic agents against animal and human infections. In spite of this wide range of possible applications, their exploitation on the industrial level is still in its infancy. Here, we initially briefly report on the biodiversity of killer toxins and the ecological significance of their production. Their actual and possible applications in the agro-food industry are discussed, together with recent advances in their heterologous production and the manipulation for development of peptide-based therapeutic agents.",Circulating levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 are associated with metabolic syndrome rather than with menopause.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31023101,Gynecological endocrinology : the official journal of the International Society of Gynecological Endocrinology,2019 04 26,"The plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) is the major determinant of fibrinolytic activity. PAI-1 concentrations are elevated in obesity, type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome (MetS). On the other hand, during menopause, fibrinolytic activity decreases and, consequently, PAI-1 concentration increases; however, it is debated whether menopause is an independent determinant factor of PAI-1 levels. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of hormonal and metabolic status on the concentration of PAI-1 in pre-and post-menopausal women. A case-control study was conducted in ninety pre-and post-menopausal women aged 45 to 55 years, matched by body mass index (BMI). Anthropometric measurements and biochemical determinations were performed on all participants. The fibrinolytic activity was determined by measuring PAI-1 by ELISA. Of all the women, 30% presented MetS. Women with MetS had higher values of PAI-1 (36.0 ± 19.1 vs 19.3 ± 14.8 ng/mL, p < .001); in contrast, no differences were observed when compared by hormonal status (20.7 ± 18.10 vs 20.2 ± 17.0 ng/mL, NS). The results of this study suggest that in women, MetS plays a more important role in the deterioration of the fibrinolytic mechanisms rather than their hormonal status. Therefore, the identification of cardio-metabolic factors is relevant to reduce the presence of thrombosis in post-menopausal women.","A Phase II, single-arm trial of neoadjuvant axitinib plus avelumab in patients with localized renal cell carcinoma who are at high risk of relapse after nephrectomy (NEOAVAX).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31023100,"Future oncology (London, England)",2019 04 26,"Surgery is the standard treatment for nonmetastatic renal cell carcinoma. Despite curative intent, patients with a high risk of relapse have a 5-year metastasis-free survival rate of only 30% and prevention of recurrence is an unmet need. In a Phase III trial (JAVELIN Renal 101), progression-free survival of axitinib + avelumab was superior to sunitinib with a favorable objective response rate and no added toxicity profiles as known for axitinib or avelumab single agent. NEOAVAX is designed as open label, single arm, Phase II trial with a Simon's two-stage design evaluating neoadjuvant axitinib + avelumab followed by complete surgical resection in 40 patients with high-risk nonmetastatic clear-cell renal cell carcinoma. Primary end point is remission of the primary tumor (RECIST 1.1; Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors) following neoadjuvant therapy. Secondary end points include disease-free survival, overall survival, rate of metastasis and local recurrence, safety, and tolerability. Exploratory end points include investigation of effects on neoangiogenesis, immune infiltrates and myeloid-derived suppressor cell components to support a rationale for the combined use of axitinib and avelumab (NCT03341845).",Efficacy and safety of intense pulsed light in the treatment of inflammatory acne vulgaris with a novel filter.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31023099,Journal of cosmetic and laser therapy : official publication of the European Society for Laser Dermatology,2019 04 26,"Acne vulgaris is one of the most common skin diseases affecting young people.

We aim evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of a novel IPL filter at wavelength of 400-600 nm and 800-1,200 nm in the treatment of inflammatory acne lesions. Twenty-one patients with Pillsbury I-III facial acne vulgaris between July 2017 and January 2018 were enrolled in this prospective clinical study. Five sessions of IPL treatment were administered to the subjects at 4-week interval. Final assessment was performed 1 month after the final treatment. One month posttreatment, over 75% subjects exhibited excellent or good response. Of the Pillsbury I-II patients, the effective rate reached 88.24%. The inflammatory lesions were dramatically decreased (25.23 ± 2.76 versus 14.01 ± 1.98) and statistically evident (P = .031). According to Hayashi assessment of acne severity, there was a significant improvement at follow-up visit (P = .022). Moreover, patients reported significant improvements in self-evaluation. The novel IPL filter at wavelength of 400-600 nm and 800-1,200 nm provides an effective option to treatment of inflammatory acne lesions, especially for Pillsbury I-II acne patients, with minimal reversible side effects, such as transient post-inflammatory pigmentation.",Is lipid goal one-size-fits-all: A review of evidence for recommended low-density lipoprotein treatment targets in Asian patients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31023098,European journal of preventive cardiology,2019 04 26,"The international guideline recommendations for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering were made based on the results of randomized controlled trials (RCTs), meta-analyses, and observational studies mostly in the White population. It was not clear whether these LDL-C targets could be applicable to other ethnic groups, for example, Asian patients. This review aimed to address major aspects related to the lipid goal and statin therapy in Asia, including the epidemiology of cardiovascular disease, the LDL-C profiles, the lipid goals from localized guidelines, genetics and lifestyles, and the efficacy and safety of statins. Owing to the geographic, ethnic, genetic, and cultural diversity in this region, we observed a geographic pattern of diversity in cardiovascular epidemiology and statin response in Central Asia, East Asia (particularly for Asia-Pacific region), and South Asia. The rapidly growing literature from Asian countries questioning ""lower is better"" hypothesis was noticed. However, owing to the nature of these dominantly observational data, the conclusion was hardly confirmative. Despite the rapid expansion of the current literature in this region, efforts should be made to ensure an adequate sample size to assess the significance of a given lipid parameter on overall cardiovascular outcomes in this Asian population.",Do rebreathing manoeuvres for non-invasive measurement of cardiac output during maximum exercise test alter the main cardiopulmonary parameters?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31023097,European journal of preventive cardiology,2019 04 26,"Inert gas rebreathing has been recently described as an emergent reliable non-invasive method for cardiac output determination during exercise, allowing a relevant improvement of cardiopulmonary exercise test clinical relevance.

American women often suffer from debilitating symptoms for a decade before being diagnosed. Addressing this deficiency is crucial if women are to live well with endometriosis. Framed by relational dialectics theory 2.0, the current study analyzes women's experiences of endometriosis diagnoses via online narrative postings. Results reveal two centripetal (dominant) discourses: (a) the discourse of psycho-abnormality, and (b) the discourse of biological normality. Narrators' invocation of the discourse of psycho-abnormality disqualifies women's suffering as imagined and ""all in their heads,"" whereas invocation of the discourse of biological normality naturalizes women's suffering as ""just part of being a woman."" The discourse of psycho-abnormality and the discourse of biological normality, both rooted in patriarchal influences, hinder diagnosis and subsequently treatment and rehabilitation of endometriosis. Encouragingly, a third (though marginalized) discourse emerged: the discourse of reclaiming expertise. Narrators' invocation of this discourse directly opposes the discourses of psycho-abnormality and biological normality by inciting validation of embodied knowledge in medical encounters and urging patients to enact agency in healthcare settings. This project discusses the interplay of these three discourses, and aims to improve diagnostic efficacy as a result.",Reoperation Rates and Costs of Radial Head Arthroplasty Versus Open Reduction and Internal Fixation of Radial Head and Neck Fractures: A Retrospective Database Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31023094,"Hand (New York, N.Y.)",2019 04 26,We conducted a retrospective study to compare reoperation/conversion rates and costs between open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) and radial head arthroplasty (RHA) in patients with radial head/neck fractures.,TPR-containing proteins control protein organization and homeostasis for the endoplasmic reticulum.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31023093,Critical reviews in biochemistry and molecular biology,2019 05 30,"The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a complex, multifunctional organelle comprised of a continuous membrane and lumen that is organized into a number of functional regions. It plays various roles including protein translocation, folding, quality control, secretion, calcium signaling, and lipid biogenesis. Cellular protein homeostasis is maintained by a complicated chaperone network, and the largest functional family within this network consists of proteins containing tetratricopeptide repeats (TPRs). TPRs are well-studied structural motifs that mediate intermolecular protein-protein interactions, supporting interactions with a wide range of ligands or substrates. Seven TPR-containing proteins have thus far been shown to localize to the ER and control protein organization and homeostasis within this multifunctional organelle. Here, we discuss the roles of these proteins in controlling ER processes and organization. The crucial roles that TPR-containing proteins play in the ER are highlighted by diseases or defects associated with their mutation or disruption."

Thus, we investigated the effects of cardamonin on the apoptotic cell death and associated gene expression in mouse leukemia WEHI-3 cells in vitro. Results indicated that cardamonin decreased total viable cell number via induced cell morphological changes and apoptotic cell death in WEHI-3 cells that were assay by contrast-phase microscopy and flow cytometry examinations, respectively.

Western blotting was performed to analyze expression of relevant pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins and results showed that cardamonin decreased anti-apoptotic protein of Bcl-2 but increased pro-apoptotic protein of Bax in WEHI-3 cells. Furthermore, cardamonin increased cytochrome c, AIF and Endo G release, increased GRP78, caspase-12 that were associated with ER stress and increased Fas, Fas-Ligand and FADD expression. Furthermore, cardamonin increased the gene expressions of DAP (death-associated protein), TMBIM4 transmembrane (BAX inhibitor motif containing 4), ATG5 (autophagy related 5) but decreased the gene expression of DDIT3 (DNA-damage inducible transcript 3), DDIT4 (DNA-damage-inducible transcript 4), BAG6 (BCL2-associated athanogene 6), BCL2L13 [BCL2-like 13 (apoptosis facilitator)] and BRAT1 (BRCA1-associated ATM activator 1) that are associated with apoptosis pathways.

The purpose of this literature review was to identify functional polymorphisms associated with common symptoms (i.e., pain, sleep disturbance, fatigue, affective and cognitive symptoms) with the goal of identifying a parsimonious list of functional genetic polymorphisms with evidence to advocate for their inclusion in symptom science research. PubMed was searched to identify genes and functional polymorphisms associated with symptoms across chronic conditions, revealing eight functional genetic polymorphisms in seven different genes that showed evidence of association with at least three or more symptoms and/or symptom clusters: BDNF rs6265, COMT rs4680, FKBP5 rs3800373, IL-6 rs1800795, NFKB2 rs1056890, SLC6A4 5-HTTLPR+rs25531, and TNFA rs1799964 and rs1800629. Of these genes, three represent protein biomarkers previously identified as common data elements for symptom science research (BDNF, IL-6, and TNFA), and the polymorphisms in these genes identified through the search are known to impact secretion or level of transcription of these protein biomarkers. Inclusion of genotype data for polymorphisms offers great potential to further advance scientific knowledge of the biological basis of individual symptoms and symptom clusters across studies. Additionally, these polymorphisms have the potential to be used as targets to optimize precision health through the identification of individuals at risk for poor symptom experiences as well as the development of symptom management interventions.",What factors influence healthcare professionals to refer children and families to paediatric psychology?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31023071,Clinical child psychology and psychiatry,2019 04 26,"This study aimed to investigate factors influencing referral of children with physical illness to paediatric psychology.

Materials & methods: The prescription costs analysis database was used to document utilization and expenditure on SSRIs between 2001 and 2017 alongside documenting the initiatives. Results: Multiple interventions over the years increased international nonproprietary name prescribing up to 99.9% lowering overall costs. This, coupled with initiatives to limit escitalopram prescribing due to concerns with its value, resulted in a 73.7% reduction in SSRI expenditure between 2001 and 2017 despite a 2.34-fold increase in utilization. Safety warnings resulted in a significant reduction in the prescribing of paroxetine, citalopram and escitalopram alongside a significant increase in sertraline Conclusion: Multiple initiatives have increased the quality and efficiency of SSRI prescribing in Scotland providing direction to others."

TCM regards each individual as unique so all corresponding therapeutic and preventive approaches in TCM are personalized. Personalized medicine, also referred to as precision medicine, is an emerging medical paradigm that points toward a new direction for future medical development. TCM constitution studies the holistic body condition, which is affected by both inborn and acquired factors. Body constitution lays the foundation for disease diagnosis, prevention and treatment. Different constitution types predispose individuals to different disease susceptibilities. Examining an individual's unique body constitution can promote effective health management and benefit the application of personalized medicine significantly. This review will introduce and discuss the application of the TCM constitution for health maintenance and disease prevention. In last decade, a number of modern techniques have been employed in the constitution research to evaluate the health status of individuals. The TCM constitution reflects the current status and future trends of human health in four aspects, i.e., individual differences, life processes, psychological condition and adaptability to natural and social environments. This TCM constitution theory has already been applied in the Chinese public health management at different levels with promising outcome.

In patients who are prescribed biotin or take biotin supplements, biotin has the potential to cause falsely low or falsely high results in immunoassays using streptavidin-biotin binding as part of the assay methodology. Streptavidin-biotin binding is used by many manufacturers; some manufacturers use it for most of their immunoassays, some for a few of their immunoassays and some manufacturers do not use this assay format at all. The direction and magnitude of interference and the concentration of biotin which affects an assay are highly variable and assay specific. There have been many papers and case reports published recently of biotin interference in immunoassay, and biotin interference is probably one of the most difficult types of inference to detect and to obviate.

Discussion of ice growth has often focused around the role of the surface in templating the structure of water, forcing the first layer to adopt the registry of the underlying substrate rather than that of ice. To grow a thick ice film, water in the first few ice layers must accommodate this strain, but understanding how this occurs requires detailed molecular-scale information that is lacking. Here we combine scanning tunneling microscopy, low-energy electron diffraction, and work-function measurements with electronic structure calculations to investigate the initial stages of ice growth on a Pt alloy surface, having a lattice spacing 6% larger than ice. Although the first layer of water forms a strictly commensurate hexagonal network, this behavior does not extend to the second layer. Instead, water forms a 2D structure containing extended defect rows made from face-sharing pentamer and octamer rings. The defect rows allow the majority of second-layer water to remain commensurate with the solid surface while compensating lateral strain by increasing the water density close to that of an ice surface. The observation of octamer-pentamer rows in ice films formed on several surfaces suggests that the octamer-pentamer defect motif acts as a flexible strain relief mechanism in thin ice films, providing a mechanism that is not available during the growth of strained films in other materials, such as semiconductors.",Multiscale Simulation of Morphology Evolution of Supported Pt Nanoparticles via Interfacial Control.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31023009,Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids,2019 05 15,"The structural and electronic properties of the interface are critical for the morphology of supported metal nanoparticles and thus the performance in catalysis, photonics, biomedical research, and other areas. To reveal the intrinsic mechanism of the formation of various morphologies, a multiscale simulation strategy is adopted to bridge the macroscopic structures by experimental observations and microscopic properties by theoretical calculations. This strategy incorporates the density functional theory (DFT) for the interaction energy calculation, the molecular dynamics (MD) simulation for the structure evolution, and theoretical model for the correlation with contact angles. The interaction energies between Pt atoms (four-atom clusters) and substrates are applied for the force field parametrization in the following MD simulation. Simulation results show the binding energies and structural properties such as radial distribution function and coordination number for supported metal nanoparticles with various sizes in detail. Notably, the contact angles of supported nanoparticles are well correlated by the strength of metal-support interactions.

When two stereocenters and thus four stereoisomeric products are involved, obtaining stereodivergent enzyme mutants for individually accessing all four stereoisomers would be ideal. Although significant success has been achieved in directed evolution of enzymes in general, stereodivergent engineering of one enzyme into four highly stereocomplementary variants for obtaining the full complement of stereoisomers bearing multiple stereocenters remains a challenge. Using Candida antarctica lipase B (CALB) as a model, we report the protein engineering of this enzyme into four highly stereocomplementary variants needed for obtaining all four stereoisomers in transesterification reactions between racemic acids and racemic alcohols in organic solvents. By generating and screening less than 25 variants of each isomer, we achieved >90% selectivity for all of the four possible stereoisomers in the model reaction. This difficult feat was accomplished by developing a strategy dubbed ""focused rational iterative site-specific mutagenesis"" (FRISM) at sites lining the enzyme's binding pocket. The accumulation of single mutations by iterative site-specific mutagenesis using a restricted set of rationally chosen amino acids allows the formation of ultrasmall mutant libraries requiring minimal screening for stereoselectivity. The crystal structure of all stereodivergent CALB variants, flanked by MD simulations, uncovered the source of selectivity."

However, our understanding of its function regarding virus and host interaction is still limited. In this study, we employed immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry to screen for cellular interacting partners of ORF3. Gene ontology analysis of the host interactome highlighted the involvement of ORF3 in endosomal and immune signaling pathways. Among the identified ORF3-interacting proteins, the vacuolar protein-sorting-associated protein 36 (VPS36) was assessed for its role in PEDV replication. VPS36 was found to interact with ORF3 regardless of its GLUE domain. As a result of VPS36-ORF3 interaction, PEDV replication was substantially suppressed in cells overexpressing VPS36. Interestingly, the ORF3 protein expression was diminished in VPS36-overexpressing cells, an effect that could not be restored by treatment of lysosomal inhibitors. In addition, disruption of endogenously-expressed VPS36 by siRNA could partially augment PEDV replication. Taken together, our study provides mechanistic insights into the contribution of ORF3 in PEDV replication.","Rosmarinic Acid Attenuates Cadmium-Induced Nephrotoxicity via Inhibition of Oxidative Stress, Apoptosis, Inflammation and Fibrosis.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022990,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 06 10,"The present investigation was executed to reveal the protective mechanism of rosmarinic acid (RA) against cadmium (Cd)-induced nephrotoxicity. RA exhibited a concentration-dependent anti-apoptotic effect against CdCl2 in isolated mouse proximal tubular epithelial cells. Cd treatment significantly (p < 0.01) imparted oxidative stress to the renal cells via excessive ROS production, triggering NO level, NADPH oxidase activation, and impairment of cellular redox defense system. Cd-mediated oxidative stress significantly (p < 0.01) endorsed apoptosis to the murine kidney cells by triggering NF-κB/PKC-δ/TNFR2 activation. In addition, CdCl2 induced renal fibrosis by triggering TGF-β1/SMAD3/α-SMA/collagen signaling within renal cells. On the other hand, RA significantly (p < 0.05-0.01) attenuated Cd-provoked oxidative stress and associated pathological signal transduction in murine renal cells. RA treatment also could significantly (p < 0.05-0.01) reciprocate Cd-mediated pathological changes in blood and urine parameters in mice. In addition, histological data supported the pharmacological findings. In silico chemometric analyses predicted the possible interactions between RA and different signal proteins and anticipated drug-likeness characteristics of RA. Hence, RA can potentially be applied as a therapeutic agent to treat Cd-mediated nephrotoxicity in future.","Naked Oat (Avena nuda L.)

Results from epidemiological studies are conflicting and limited by short follow-up and small sample sizes. The objective of this study was to examine if children born to women exposed to the margarine fortification policy with a small dose of extra vitamin D during pregnancy had a reduced risk of developing asthma until age 9 years, compared to children born to unexposed women. The termination of a Danish mandatory vitamin D fortification policy constituted the basis for the study design. We compared the risk of inpatient asthma diagnoses in all Danish children born two years before (n = 106,347, exposed) and two years after (n = 115,900, unexposed) the termination of the policy. The children were followed in the register from 0-9 years of age. Data were analyzed using Cox proportional hazards regression. The Hazard Ratio for the first inpatient asthma admission among exposed versus unexposed children was 0.96 (95%CI: 0.90-1.04). When stratifying by sex and age, 0-3 years old boys exposed to vitamin D fortification showed a lower asthma risk compared to unexposed boys (HR 0.78, 95%CI: 0.67-0.92). Prenatal exposure to margarine fortification policy with extra vitamin D did not affect the overall risk of developing asthma among children aged 0-9 years but seemed to reduce the risk among 0-3 years old boys. Taking aside study design limitations, this could be explained by different sensitivity to vitamin D from different sex-related asthma phenotypes in children with early onset, and sex differences in lung development or immune responses.",Synthesis and Characterization of Covalently Crosslinked pH-Responsive Hyaluronic Acid Nanogels: Effect of Synthesis Parameters.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022975,Polymers,2019 06 10,"Stable hyaluronic acid nanogels were obtained following the water-in-oil microemulsion method by covalent crosslinking with three biocompatible crosslinking agents: Divinyl sulfone, 1,4-butanediol diglycidyl ether (BDDE), and poly(ethylene glycol) bis(amine).

It has been described as a virtual organ owing to the myriad of functions it performs, including the production of bioactive metabolites, regulation of immunity, energy homeostasis and protection against pathogens. These activities are dependent on the quantity and quality of the microbiota alongside its metabolic potential, which are dictated by a number of factors, including diet and host genetics. In this regard, the gut microbiome is malleable and varies significantly from host to host. These two features render the gut microbiome a candidate 'organ' for the possibility of precision microbiomics - the use of the gut microbiome as a biomarker to predict responsiveness to specific dietary constituents to generate precision diets and interventions for optimal health.

Precisely, in human stem cells, the PI3K cascade is involved in different processes from pluripotency and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) reprogramming to mesenchymal and oral mesenchymal differentiation, through different and interconnected mechanisms.",Recent Status and Methodological Quality of Return-to-Work Rates of Cancer Patients Reported in Japan: A Systematic Review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022971,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 06 10,"Cancer patients' return-to-work rates in Japan and their methodological quality have been little reported. We conducted a systematic review to explore the recent return-to-work rates and to assess the methodological quality of the existing literature. We selected 13 papers (2 in English and 11 in Japanese) published between 2005 and 2017. The return-to-work rates ranged from 53.8% to 95.2%. Of the selected papers, 12 papers employed a cross-sectional design, possessing high risk of selection bias due to participant selection. A total of 8 papers did not fully report the subjects' sex, age, employment status at cancer diagnosis, cancer site, stage, and treatment, suggesting high risk of selection bias due to confounding variables. High or unclear risk of attrition bias due to incomplete outcome data was detected in 12 papers in which data on return to work were not collected from all participants. High risk of reporting bias due to selective outcome reporting was pointed out in 6 studies in which the subjects' employment status at return to work or the duration between cancer diagnosis and assessment of return to work was unclear. Future studies must reduce the risk of selection, attrition, and reporting biases for specifying accurate return-to-work rates.",Characterization of Cementation Factor of Unconsolidated Granular Materials Through Time Domain Reflectometry with Variable Saturated Conditions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022970,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 10,"The cementation factor is necessary to determine porosity via the Archie equation, and its range of values has been suggested in many previous studies. However, the cementation factors in the literature are limited to fully saturated conditions, and it may thus be inaccurate to use the same value in other saturation conditions. The objective of this study is to characterize how the cementation factor varies depending on the saturation percentage. In this study, glass beads and soil are selected as the specimens, and two relative density values, 40% and 80%, are selected. Time domain reflectometry (TDR) is used to obtain both the saturation and electrical resistivity of the specimens. TDR is installed in the cell, and fluid is continuously circulated from the bottom to the top of the porous material for 30 min. The estimated saturation increases with time and the electrical resistivity is reduced during the circulation. Finally, the cementation factor at every saturated stage is determined, and the error ratio based on the porosity is calculated to show the importance of the cementation factor. The results show that there is a high error ratio when an unsuitable cementation factor that does not consider the saturation condition is used. This study demonstrates that the method for determining the actual cementation factor using TDR and the Archie equation can be applied in various saturation conditions.",Pharmacological Applications of Nrf2 Inhibitors as Potential Antineoplastic Drugs.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022969,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 06 10,"Oxidative stress (OS) is associated with many diseases ranging from cancer to neurodegenerative disorders. Nuclear factor-erythroid 2 p45-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is one of the most effective cytoprotective controller against OS. Modulation of Nrf2 pathway constitutes a remarkable strategy in the antineoplastic treatments. A big number of Nrf2-antioxidant response element activators have been screened for use as chemo-preventive drugs in OS associated diseases like cancer even though activation of Nrf2 happens in a variety of cancers. Research proved that hyperactivation of the Nrf2 pathway produces a situation that helps the survival of normal as well as malignant cells, protecting them against OS, anticancer drugs, and radiotherapy. In this review, the modulation of the Nrf2 pathway, anticancer activity and challenges associated with the development of an Nrf2-based anti-cancer treatment approaches are discussed.",Experimental and Theoretical Studies on the Corrosion Inhibition of Carbon Steel by Two Indazole Derivatives in HCl Medium.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022968,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 10,"In this work, two indazole derivatives, namely 5-aminoindazole (AIA) and 5-nitroindazole (NIA), were investigated as corrosion inhibitors for carbon steel in 1 M HCl solution by experimental and density functional theory (DFT) methods. The electrochemical results indicate that the inhibition ability follows the order of AIA > NIA, which is due to the stronger electron-donating effect of -NH2 of the AIA group than the -NO2 group of NIA. Besides, the frontier orbital theory shows that the AIA exhibits higher reaction activity than NIA, and a more negative adsorption energy for AIA was also obtained, which is consistent with the analysis of the electrochemical measurements. We draw the conclusion that the electron-donating effect makes it easier for AIA to donate electrons to iron atoms to form a stronger protective layer than NIA."

The supply chain network interest coordination model analyzes the relationship between the dominant manufacturer behavior and the supply chain network green index and network profit. The results show that fulfilling green contracts helps improve the profitability and sustainability of supply chain networks. A counter-intuitive but interesting result is that the dominant manufacturers increase the cost-sharing ratio or penalties of the logistics network, which will reduce the profit level and green index of the logistics network, and increase the cost-sharing ratio or punishment of the suppliers. Strength will increase the profitability and green index of the logistics network. Finally, we validate the relevant conclusions of the model through numerical simulation analysis.",Prevention of Sudden Death Related to Sport: The Science of Basic Life Support-from Theory to Practice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022955,Journal of clinical medicine,2019 06 10,"The sudden cardiac arrest (CA) and death of athletes are dramatic and emotionally impacting events for health professionals, family, and society. Although the practice of sport participation improves general health, physical fitness, and quality of life, intense physical exercise can be a trigger for CA and sudden death occasionally in the presence of known or unknown cardiac disorders (mainly hypertrophic cardiomyopathy) and risk factors (environment, health style, family, and genetic). The present review found that sudden death associated with CA was not such a common event in competitive athletes, but it might be an underestimated event in recreational athletes. Thus, considering the exponential increase in sport participation, both in a recreational or competitive way, and the rate of sudden CA, knowledge of implementing prevention and treatment strategies is crucial. This includes preparation of health professionals and lay people in basic life support (BLS); screening and pre-participation assessment in sport programs and health education; and promotion for the recognition of CA and early completion of BLS and rapid access to automatic external defibrillator to improve the victim survival/prognosis. Thus, the purpose of this review is to provide for health professionals and lay people the most updated information, based on current guidelines, of how to proceed in an emergency situation associated with sudden CA of young adult athletes.",Exogenous Cytokine-Free Differentiation of Human Pluripotent Stem Cells into Classical Brown Adipocytes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022954,Cells,2019 06 10,"We previously established a method for a directed differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells into classical brown adipocytes (BA) by forming aggregates via massive floating culture in the presence of a specific cytokine cocktail. However, use of recombinant cytokines requires significant cost. Moreover, an enforced differentiation by exogenously added cytokines may amend skewed differentiation propensity of patient's pluripotent stem cells, providing unsatisfactory disease models. Therefore, an exogenous cytokine-free method, where cytokines required for differentiation are provided in an auto/paracrine manner mimicking natural developmental process, is beneficial. Here we show that, if human pluripotent stem cells are cultured as size-controlled spheroids (100-120 µm radius, 2000-2500 cells/spheroid) in a mutually segregated manner with half-change of the medium every other day, they differentiate into classical BA via an authentic MYF5-positive myoblast route in the absence of exogenous cytokines. Differentiated BA exerted thermogenic activity in transplanted mice in response to beta-adrenergic receptor agonist stimuli. The cytokine-free differentiation method has further advantages in exploring BATokines, BA-derived physiologically active substances. Indeed, we have found that BA produces an unknown small (<1000 Da), highly hydrophilic molecule that augments insulin secretion from pancreatic beta cells. Our upgraded technique will contribute to an advancement of stem cell study for diverse purposes.",The Impact of Caloric Restriction on the Epigenetic Signatures of Aging.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022953,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 06 10,"Aging is characterized by an extensive remodeling of epigenetic patterns, which has been implicated in the physiopathology of age-related diseases. Nutrition plays a significant role in modulating the epigenome, and a growing amount of data indicate that dietary changes can modify the epigenetic marks associated with aging. In this review, we will assess the current advances in the relationship between caloric restriction, a proven anti-aging intervention, and epigenetic signatures of aging. We will specifically discuss the impact of caloric restriction on epigenetic regulation and how some of the favorable effects of caloric restriction on lifespan and healthspan could be mediated by epigenetic modifications.",p53-Dependent Apoptotic Effect of Puromycin via Binding of Ribosomal Protein L5 and L11 to MDM2 and its Combination Effect with RITA or Doxorubicin.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022952,Cancers,2019 06 10,"Among ribosomal proteins essential for protein synthesis, the functions of ribosomal protein L5 (RPL5) and RPL11 still remain unclear to date. Here, the roles of RPL5 and RPL11 were investigated in association with p53/p21 signaling in the antitumor effect of puromycin mainly in HCT116 and H1299 cancer cells. Cell proliferation assays using 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazole-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assays and colony formation assays, cell cycle analysis, Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blotting were performed in cancer cells. Puromycin exerted cytotoxic and anti-proliferative effects in p53 wild-type HCT116 more than in p53 null H1299 cells. Consistently, puromycin increased sub-G1, cleaved Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), activated p53, p21, and Mouse double minute 2 homolog (MDM2), and attenuated expression of c-Myc in HCT116 cells. Notably, puromycin upregulated the expression of RPL5 and RPL11 to directly bind to MDM2 in HCT116 cells. Conversely, deletion of RPL5 and RPL11 blocked the activation of p53, p21, and MDM2 in HCT116 cells. Also, puromycin enhanced the antitumor effect with reactivating p53 and inducing tumor apoptosis (RITA) or doxorubicin in HCT116 cells. These findings suggest that puromycin induces p53-dependent apoptosis via upregulation of RPL5 or RPL11 for binding with MDM2, and so can be used more effectively in p53 wild-type cancers by combination with RITA or doxorubicin.",Antitumor Effects of Intra-Arterial Delivery of Albumin-Doxorubicin Nanoparticle Conjugated Microbubbles Combined with Ultrasound-Targeted Microbubble Activation on VX2 Rabbit Liver Tumors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022951,Cancers,2019 06 10,"Image-guided intra-arterial therapies play a key role in the management of hepatic malignancies. However, limited clinical outcomes suggest the need for new multifunctional drug delivery systems to enhance local drug concentration while reducing systemic adverse reactions. Therefore, we developed the albumin-doxorubicin nanoparticle conjugated microbubble (ADMB) to enhance therapeutic efficiency by sonoporation under exposure to ultrasound. ADMB demonstrated a size distribution of 2.33 ± 1.34 µm and a doxorubicin loading efficiency of 82.7%. The echogenicity of ADMBs was sufficiently generated in the 2-9 MHz frequency range and cavitation depended on the strength of the irradiating ultrasound. In the VX2 rabbit tumor model, ADMB enhanced the therapeutic efficiency under ultrasound exposure, compared to free doxorubicin. The intra-arterial administration of ADMBs sufficiently reduced tumor growth by five times, compared to the control group. Changes in the ADC values and viable tumor fraction supported the fact that the antitumor effect of ADMBs were enhanced by evidence of necrosis ratio (over 70%) and survival tumor cell fraction (20%). Liver toxicity was comparable to that of conventional therapies. In conclusion, this study shows that tumor suppression can be sufficiently maximized by combining ultrasound exposure with intra-arterial ADMB administration.",The Next Frontier in Health Geography: Context and Implications for Interventions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022950,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 06 10,"During an opening panel of the 2018 International Health Congress in Oxford, a question was raised as to how protection could be offered to young researchers in particular who explore new ideas [...].",Ectopic Expression of a Fagopyrum esculentum APETALA1 Ortholog only Rescues Sepal Development in Arabidopsis ap1 Mutant.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022949,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 06 10,"Fagopyrum esculentum (Polygonaceae: Caryophyllales) exhibits an undifferentiated perianth comprising five showy tepals, which does not completely correspond to the perianth differentiated into typical sepals and petals in most core eudicots. In Arabidopsis, the APETALA1 (AP1) gene is involved in specifying sepals and petals development. Here we isolated AP1 ortholog, FaesAP1, and a 2.2kb FaesAP1 promoter (pFaesAP1) from F. esculentum. FaesAP1 expression is mainly detectable in all floral organs and maintains at a high level when tepals elongate rapidly both in pin and thrum flowers. Moreover, the GUS reporter gene driven by pFaesAP1 was activated in flowers where the sepals were intense, but the petals very weak or absent. Additionally, FaesAP1 ectopic expression in Arabidopsis ap1-10 mutant rescues sepal development fully, obviously prompting early flowering, but failing to complement petal development. In this study, evidence was provided that the showy tepals in the F. esculentum are homologs to core eudicots sepals. Furthermore, these findings show a different perianth identity program in Caryophyllales, suggesting that AP1 orthologs involved in petal development may evolve independently across different clades of core eudicots. Our results also suggest that FaesAP1 holds potential for biotechnical engineering to develop early flowering varieties of F. esculentum.",Lack of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Transmission in Rabbits.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022948,Viruses,2019 06 10,"Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) transmission from dromedaries to humans has resulted in major outbreaks in the Middle East. Although some other livestock animal species have been shown to be susceptible to MERS-CoV, it is not fully understood why the spread of the virus in these animal species has not been observed in the field. In this study, we used rabbits to further characterize the transmission potential of MERS-CoV. In line with the presence of MERS-CoV receptor in the rabbit nasal epithelium, high levels of viral RNA were shed from the nose following virus inoculation. However, unlike MERS-CoV-infected dromedaries, these rabbits did not develop clinical manifestations including nasal discharge and did shed only limited amounts of infectious virus from the nose. Consistently, no transmission by contact or airborne routes was observed in rabbits. Our data indicate that despite relatively high viral RNA levels produced, low levels of infectious virus are excreted in the upper respiratory tract of rabbits as compared to dromedary camels, thus resulting in a lack of viral transmission.",Improvement of l-Leucine Production in Corynebacterium glutamicum by Altering the Redox Flux.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022947,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 06 10,"The production of l-leucine was improved by the disruption of ltbR encoding transcriptional regulator and overexpression of the key genes (leuAilvBNCE) of the l-leucine biosynthesis pathway in Corynebacterium glutamicum XQ-9. In order to improve l-leucine production, we rationally engineered C. glutamicum to enhance l-leucine production, by improving the redox flux. On the basis of this, we manipulated the redox state of the cells by mutating the coenzyme-binding domains of acetohydroxyacid isomeroreductase encoded by ilvC, inserting NAD-specific leucine dehydrogenase, encoded by leuDH from Lysinibacillus sphaericus, and glutamate dehydrogenase encoded by rocG from Bacillus subtilis, instead of endogenous branched-chain amino acid transaminase and glutamate dehydrogenase, respectively. The yield of l-leucine reached 22.62 ± 0.17 g·L-1 by strain ΔLtbR-acetohydroxyacid isomeroreductase (AHAIR)M/ABNCME, and the concentrations of the by-products (l-valine and l-alanine) increased, compared to the strain ΔLtbR/ABNCE. Strain ΔLtbR-AHAIRMLeuDH/ABNCMLDH accumulated 22.87±0.31 g·L-1 l-leucine, but showed a drastically low l-valine accumulation (from 8.06 ± 0.35 g·L-1 to 2.72 ± 0.11 g·L-1), in comparison to strain ΔLtbR-AHAIRM/ABNCME, which indicated that LeuDH has much specificity for l-leucine synthesis but not for l-valine synthesis. Subsequently, the resultant strain ΔLtbR-AHAIRMLeuDHRocG/ABNCMLDH accumulated 23.31 ± 0.24 g·L-1 l-leucine with a glucose conversion efficiency of 0.191 g·g-1."

Both proteins are primarily expressed on platelets and megakaryocytes whereas GPVI expression is also shown on endothelial and integrin α2β1 expression on epithelial cells. We recently showed that depletion of GPVI improves stroke outcome without increasing the risk of cerebral hemorrhage. Genetic variants associated with higher platelet surface integrin α2 (ITGA2) receptor levels have frequently been found to correlate with an increased risk of ischemic stroke in patients. However until now, no preclinical stroke study has addressed whether platelet integrin α2β1 contributes to the pathophysiology of ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. Focal cerebral ischemia was induced in C57BL/6 and Itga2-/- mice by a 60 min transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO). Additionally, wild-type animals were pretreated with anti-GPVI antibody (JAQ1) or Fab fragments of a function blocking antibody against integrin α2β1 (LEN/B). In anti-GPVI treated animals, intravenous (IV) recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) treatment was applied immediately prior to reperfusion. Stroke outcome, including infarct size and neurological scoring was determined on day 1 after tMCAO. We demonstrate that targeting the integrin α2β1 (pharmacologic; genetic) did neither reduce stroke size nor improve functional outcome on day 1 after tMCAO. In contrast, depletion of platelet GPVI prior to stroke was safe and effective, even when combined with rt-PA treatment. Our results underscore that GPVI, but not ITGA2, is a promising and safe target in the setting of ischemic stroke.",Electrospun Nanofibers: Recent Applications in Drug Delivery and Cancer Therapy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022935,"Nanomaterials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 10,"Polymeric nanofibers (NFs) have been extensively reported as a biocompatible scaffold to be specifically applied in several researching fields, including biomedical applications.

The complexity necessitates investigating manageable model systems for unveiling the fundamental principles of chiral recognition at the molecular level. Here, we reported chiral recognition in the self-assembly of enantiopure and racemic hexahelicene on a Au(111) surface. Combing scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements, the asymmetric heterochiral trimers were observed as a new type of building block in racemic helicene self-assembly on Au(111). The intermolecular recognition of the heterochiral trimer was investigated upon manual separation so that the absolute configuration of each helicene molecule was unambiguously determined one by one, thus confirming that the trimer was ""2+1"" in handedness. These heterochiral trimers showed strong stability upon different coverages, which was also supported by theoretical calculations.

In this paper, the strain sensitization amplification factor of the sensor was calculated by using the flexible matrix method and the strain energy theory. The magnification had been verified by using simulation analysis and experimental results, and the error between theoretical calculation and simulation analysis was less than 7%. The result shows that the strain sensitivity of the sensor is 10.84 pm/με, which is about 10 times to that of the bare FBG sensor.

The level of weight loss achieved in diabetes prevention programs for women after GDM is often low but its effects on the cardiometabolic risk are not known. In a secondary analysis of a diabetes prevention program in postpartum women with history of gestational diabetes, we evaluated the effect of weight change on the cardiometabolic outcomes at 1-year follow-up. Of the 284 women randomized to the intervention arm, 206 with the final outcome measurements were included in the analyses. Participants were categorized into weight loss (>2 kg, n = 74), weight stable (±2 kg, n = 74) or weight gain (>2 kg, n = 58) groups. The weight loss group had significantly greater decrease in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) than the weight gain group (-0.1 + 0.4% vs. 0 + 0.4%, p = 0.049). The weight loss group had significantly greater decrease in total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol cholesterol than the other two groups (p < 0.05). The weight gain group had significantly greater increase in triglyceride and triglyceride:high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio compare with the other groups (p < 0.01).

AISI D3 is a cold work tool steel which possess high strength, more hardenability and good wear resistance properties. It has a wide variety of applications in automobile and tool and die making industries such as blanking and forming tools, high stressed cutting, deep drawing and press tools. The novel ways of machining these steels and finding out the optimum process parameters to yield good output is of practical importance in the field of research. This research work explores an attempt to identify the optimized process parameter combinations in end milling of AISI D3 steel to yield low surface roughness and maximum dish angle using trochoidal milling tool path, which is considered as a novelty in this study. 20 experimental trials based on face centered central composite design (CCD) of response surface methodology (RSM) were executed by varying the input process factors such as cutting speed, feed rate and trochoidal step. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was adopted to study the significance of selected process parameters and its relative interactions on the performance measures. Desirability-based multiple objective optimization was performed and the mathematical models were developed for prediction purposes. The developed mathematical model was statistically significant with optimum conditions of cutting speed of 41m/min, feed rate of 120 mm/min and trochoidal step of 0.9 mm. It was also found that the deviation between the experimental and predicted values is 6.10% for surface roughness and 1.33% for dish angle, respectively.",IMU-Based Automated Vehicle Slip Angle and Attitude Estimation Aided by Vehicle Dynamics.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022929,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 10,"The slip angle and attitude are vital for automated driving. In this paper, a systematic inertial measurement unit (IMU)-based vehicle slip angle and attitude estimation method aided by vehicle dynamics is proposed. This method can estimate the slip angle and attitude simultaneously and autonomously. With accurate attitude, the slip angle can be estimated precisely even though the vehicle dynamic model (VDM)-based velocity estimator diverges for a short time. First, the longitudinal velocity, pitch angle, lateral velocity, and roll angle were estimated by two estimators based on VDM considering the lever arm between the IMU and rotation center. When this information was in high fidelity, it was applied to aid the IMU-based slip angle and attitude estimators to eliminate the accumulated error correctly. Since there is a time delay in detecting the abnormal estimation results from VDM-based estimators during critical steering, a novel delay estimation and prediction structure was proposed to avoid the outlier feedback from vehicle dynamics estimators for the IMU-based slip angle and attitude estimators. Finally, the proposed estimation method was validated under large lateral excitation experimental tests including double lane change (DLC) and slalom maneuvers.",Detection of Cigarette Smoke Using a Surface-Acoustic-Wave Gas Sensor with Non-Polymer-Based Oxidized Hollow Mesoporous Carbon Nanospheres.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022928,Micromachines,2019 06 10,"The objective of this research was to develop a surface-acoustic-wave (SAW) sensor of cigarette smoke to prevent tobacco hazards and to detect cigarette smoke in real time through the adsorption of an ambient tobacco marker. The SAW sensor was coated with oxidized hollow mesoporous carbon nanospheres (O-HMC) as a sensing material of a new type, which replaced a polymer. O-HMC were fabricated using nitric acid to form carboxyl groups on carbon frameworks. The modified conditions of O-HMC were analyzed with Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FTIR), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The appropriately modified O-HMC are more sensitive than polyacrylic acid and hollow mesoporous carbon nanospheres (PAA-HMC), which is proven by normalization. This increases the sensitivity of a standard tobacco marker (3-ethenylpyridine, 3-EP) from 37.8 to 51.2 Hz/ppm and prevents the drawbacks of a polymer-based sensing material. On filtering particles above 1 μm and using tar to prevent tar adhesion, the SAW sensor detects cigarette smoke with sufficient sensitivity and satisfactory repeatability. Tests, showing satisfactory selectivity to the cigarette smoke marker (3-EP) with interfering gases CH4, CO, and CO2, show that CO and CO2 have a negligible role during the detection of cigarette smoke.",Characterization of EIAV env Quasispecies during Long-Term Passage In Vitro: Gradual Loss of Pathogenicity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022927,Viruses,2019 06 10,"As the only widely used live lentiviral vaccine, the equine infectious anima virus (EIAV) attenuated vaccine was developed by in vitro passaging of a virulent strain for 121 generations. In our previous study, we observed that the attenuated vaccine was gradually selected under increased environmental pressure at the population level (termed a quasispecies). To further elucidate the potential correlation between viral quasispecies evolution and pathogenesis, a systematic study was performed by sequencing env using several methods. Some key mutations were identified within Env, and we observed that increased percentages of these mutations were accompanied by an increased passage number and attenuated virulence. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that env mutations related to the loss of virulence might have occurred evolutionarily. Among these mutations, deletion of amino acid 236 in the V4 region of Env resulted in the loss of one N-glycosylation site that was crucial for virulence. Notably, the 236-deleted sequence represented a ""vaccine-specific"" mutation that was also found in wild EIAVLN40 strains based on single genome amplification (SGA) analysis. Therefore, our results suggest that the EIAV attenuated vaccine may originate from a branch of quasispecies of EIAVLN40. Generally, the presented results may increase our understanding of the attenuation mechanism of the EIAV vaccine and provide more information about the evolution of other lentiviruses.",Histopathological Imaging⁻Environment Interactions in Cancer Modeling.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022926,Cancers,2019 06 10,"Histopathological imaging has been routinely conducted in cancer diagnosis and recently used for modeling other cancer outcomes/phenotypes such as prognosis. Clinical/environmental factors have long been extensively used in cancer modeling. However, there is still a lack of study exploring possible interactions of histopathological imaging features and clinical/environmental risk factors in cancer modeling. In this article, we explore such a possibility and conduct both marginal and joint interaction analysis. Novel statistical methods, which are ""borrowed"" from gene⁻environment interaction analysis, are employed. Analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) data is conducted. More specifically, we examine a biomarker of lung function as well as overall survival. Possible interaction effects are identified. Overall, this study can suggest an alternative way of cancer modeling that innovatively combines histopathological imaging and clinical/environmental data."

Current strategies to prevent this problem based on device coatings with antimicrobial compounds (antibiotics or antiseptics) have proven to be insufficient, often toxic, and even promoting bacterial resistance. Herein, we report the development of an infection-preventive coating (CyanoCoating) produced with an extracellular polymer released by the marine cyanobacterium Cyanothece sp. CCY 0110. CyanoCoating was prepared by spin-coating and its bacterial anti-adhesive efficiency was evaluated against relevant etiological agents (Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli) and platelets, both in the presence or absence of human plasma proteins. CyanoCoating cytotoxicity was assessed using the L929 fibroblasts cell line. CyanoCoating exhibited a smooth topography, low thickness and high hydrophilic properties with mild negative charge. The non-cytotoxic CyanoCoating prevented adhesion of all the bacteria tested (≤80%) and platelets (<87%), without inducing platelet activation (even in the presence of plasma proteins). The significant reduction in protein adsorption (<77%) confirmed its anti-adhesive properties. The development of this anti-adhesive coating is an important step towards the establishment of a new technological platform capable of preventing medical device-associated infections, without inducing thrombus formation in blood-contacting applications.",Characterization of Reduced and Surface-Modified Graphene Oxide in Poly(Ethylene-co-Butyl Acrylate) Composites for Electrical Applications.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022914,Polymers,2019 06 10,Promising electrical field grading materials (FGMs) for high-voltage direct-current (HVDC) applications have been designed by dispersing reduced graphene oxide (rGO) grafted with relatively short chains of poly (n-butyl methacrylate) (PBMA) in a poly(ethylene-co-butyl acrylate) (EBA) matrix. All rGO-PBMA composites with a filler fraction above 3 vol.% exhibited a distinct non-linear resistivity with increasing electric field; and it was confirmed that the resistivity could be tailored by changing the PBMA graft length or the rGO filler fraction. A combined image analysis- and Monte-Carlo simulation strategy revealed that the addition of PBMA grafts improved the enthalpic solubility of rGO in EBA; resulting in improved particle dispersion and more controlled flake-to-flake distances. The addition of rGO and rGO-PBMAs increased the modulus of the materials up to 200% and the strain did not vary significantly as compared to that of the reference matrix for the rGO-PBMA-2 vol.% composites; indicating that the interphase between the rGO and EBA was subsequently improved. The new composites have comparable electrical properties as today's commercial FGMs; but are lighter and less brittle due to a lower filler fraction of semi-conductive particles (3 vol.% instead of 30-40 vol.%).,Targeting Brain Disease in MPSII: Preclinical Evaluation of IDS-Loaded PLGA Nanoparticles.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022913,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 06 10,"Mucopolysaccharidosis type II (MPSII) is a lysosomal storage disorder due to the deficit of the enzyme iduronate 2-sulfatase (IDS), which leads to the accumulation of glycosaminoglycans in most organ-systems, including the brain, and resulting in neurological involvement in about two-thirds of the patients. The main treatment is represented by a weekly infusion of the functional enzyme, which cannot cross the blood-brain barrier and reach the central nervous system. In this study, a tailored nanomedicine approach based on brain-targeted polymeric nanoparticles (g7-NPs), loaded with the therapeutic enzyme, was exploited. Fibroblasts from MPSII patients were treated for 7 days with NPs loaded with the IDS enzyme; an induced IDS activity like the one detected in healthy cells was measured, together with a reduction of GAG content to non-pathological levels. An in vivo short-term study in MPSII mice was performed by weekly administration of g7-NPs-IDS. Biochemical, histological, and immunohistochemical evaluations of liver and brain were performed. The 6-weeks treatment produced a significant reduction of GAG deposits in liver and brain tissues, as well as a reduction of some neurological and inflammatory markers (i.e., LAMP2, CD68, GFAP), highlighting a general improvement of the brain pathology. The g7-NPs-IDS approach allowed a brain-targeted enzyme replacement therapy. Based on these positive results, the future aim will be to optimize NP formulation further to gain a higher efficacy of the proposed approach.",Inkjet Printing Functionalization of SOFC LSCF Cathodes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022912,"Nanomaterials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 10,"An important segment of the future renewable energy economy is the implementation of novel energy generation systems. Such electrochemical systems are solid oxide fuel cells, which have the advantage of direct conversion of the chemical energy stored in the fuel to electrical energy with high efficiency. Improving the performance and lowering the cost of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) are strongly dependent on finding commercially viable methods for nano-functionalization of their electrodes via infiltration. Inkjet printing technology was proven to be a feasible method providing scalability and high-resolution ink delivery. LaxSr1-xCoyFe1-yO3-δ cathodes were modified using inkjet printing for infiltration with two different materials: Gd-doped ceria (CGO) commonly used as ion-conductor and La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ (LCO) commonly used as a mixed ionic electronic conductor. As-modified surface structures promoted the extension of the three-phase boundary (TPB) and enhanced the mechanisms of the oxygen reduction reaction. Electrochemical impedance measurements revealed significantly lowered polarization resistances (between 2.7 and 3.7 times) and maximum power output enhancement of 24% for CGO infiltrated electrodes and 40% for LCO infiltrated electrodes.",Built Environment and Health Behaviors: Deconstructing the Black Box of Interactions-A Review of Reviews.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022911,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 06 10,"A review of reviews following a scoping review study design was conducted in order to deconstruct the black box of interactions between the built environment and human behaviors pertaining to physical activity and/or diet. In the qualitative analysis 107 records were included, 45 of which were also coded. Most review papers confirmed the influence of the built environment on the behaviors of interest with some noting that a same built environment feature could have different behavioral outcomes. The conceptual model developed sheds light on these mixed results and brings out the role of several personal and behavioral factors in the shift from the measured to the perceived built environment. This shift was found to shape individuals' behaviors critically and to have the power of redefining the strength of every interaction. Apart from its theoretical relevance, this model has high practical relevance especially for the design and implementation of interventions with a behavioral component. Intervention researchers can use the model developed to identify and label the built environment and individual factors that can be measured objectively or perceived as facilitators, concurrent options and barriers, in order to develop comprehensive and multi-component intervention strategies.",Differences in Maternal Immunoglobulins within Mother's Own Breast Milk and Donor Breast Milk and across Digestion in Preterm Infants.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022910,Nutrients,2019 06 10,"Maternal antibody transfer to the newborn provides essential support for the infant's naïve immune system. Preterm infants normally receive maternal antibodies through mother's own breast milk (MBM) or, when mothers are unable to provide all the milk required, donor breast milk (DBM). DBM is pasteurized and exposed to several freeze-thaw cycles, which could reduce intact antibody concentration and the antibody's resistance to digestion within the infant. Whether concentrations of antibodies in MBM and DBM differ and whether their survival across digestion in preterm infants differs remains unknown. Feed (MBM or DBM), gastric contents (MBM or DBM at 1-h post-ingestion) and stool samples (collected after a mix of MBM and DBM feeding) were collected from 20 preterm (26-36 weeks gestational age) mother-infant pairs at 8-9 and 21-22 days of postnatal age. Samples were analyzed via ELISA for the concentration of secretory IgA (SIgA), total IgA (SIgA/IgA), total IgM (SIgM/IgM) and IgG. Total IgA, SIgA, total IgM and IgG concentrations were 55.0%, 71.6%, 98.4% and 41.1% higher in MBM than in DBM, and were 49.8%, 32.7%, 73.9% and 39.7% higher in gastric contents when infants were fed with MBM than when infants were fed DBM, respectively. All maternal antibody isotypes present in breast milk were detected in the infant stools, of which IgA (not sIgA) was the most abundant.","Fused in Sarcoma: Properties, Self-Assembly and Correlation with Neurodegenerative Diseases.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022909,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 10,"Fused in sarcoma (FUS) is a DNA/RNA binding protein that is involved in RNA metabolism and DNA repair. Numerous reports have demonstrated by pathological and genetic analysis that FUS is associated with a variety of neurodegenerative diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), and polyglutamine diseases. Traditionally, the fibrillar aggregation of FUS was considered to be the cause of those diseases, especially via its prion-like domains (PrLDs), which are rich in glutamine and asparagine residues. Lately, a nonfibrillar self-assembling phenomenon, liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), was observed in FUS, and studies of its functions, mechanism, and mutual transformation with pathogenic amyloid have been emerging. This review summarizes recent studies on FUS self-assembling, including both aggregation and LLPS as well as their relationship with the pathology of ALS, FTLD, and other neurodegenerative diseases.",Biotin Is Required for the Zinc Homeostasis in the Skin.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022908,Nutrients,2019 06 10,"Patients with biotin deficiency present symptoms that are similar to those in patients with acrodermatitis enteropathica (inherent zinc deficiency). However, the association between biotin and zinc deficiency remains unknown. We have previously shown that epidermal keratinocytes of mice fed zinc-deficient (ZD) diets secreted more adenosine triphosphate (ATP) than those of mice fed zinc-adequate (ZA) diets and that epidermal Langerhans cells are absent in ZD mice. Langerhans cells highly express CD39, which potently hydrolyzes ATP into adenosine monophosphate (AMP). Thus, a lack of Langerhans cells in ZD mice leads to non-hydrolysis of ATP, thereby leading to the development of ATP-mediated irritant contact dermatitis. In this study, we examined if biotin-deficient (BD) mice showed the same underlying mechanisms as those in ZD mice. BD mice showed reduced serum zinc levels, disappearance of epidermal Langerhans cells, and enhanced ATP production in the skin. Consequently, irritant contact dermatitis was significantly enhanced and prolonged in BD mice. In conclusion, the findings of our study showed that biotin deficiency leads to zinc deficiency because of which patients with biotin deficiency show similar symptoms as those with acrodermatitis enteropathica.",Vanillin as an Antifouling and Hydrophilicity Promoter Agent in Surface Modification of Polyethersulfone Membrane.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022907,Membranes,2019 06 10,"Fouling as an intricate process is considered as the main obstacle in membrane technologies, and its control is one of the main areas of attention in membrane processes. In this study, a commercial polyethersulfone ultrafiltration membrane (MWCO: 4000 g/mol) was surface modified with different concentrations of vanillin as an antifouling and hydrophilicity promoter to improve its performance. The presence of vanillin and its increasing adsorption potential trends in higher vanillin concentrations were clearly confirmed by observable changes in FTIR (Fourier transform infrared) spectra after modification. Membranes with better hydrophilicity (almost 30% lower contact angle in the best case) and higher polyethylene glycol solution (PEG) permeability were achieved after modification, where a 35-38% increase in permeability of aqueous solution of PEG was perceived when the membrane was modified at the highest exposure concentration of vanillin (2.8 g/L). After filtration of wood extract, surface modified membrane (2.8 g/L vanillin) showed better antifouling characteristics compared to unmodified membrane, as indicated by approximately 22% lower pure water flux reduction, which in turn improved the separation of lignin from the other organic compounds present in wood extract.",Feasibility of Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy and Hyperspectral Imaging for Rapid Detection of Thiophanate-Methyl Residue on Mulberry Fruit.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022906,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 06 10,"An effective and rapid way to detect thiophanate-methyl residue on mulberry fruit is important for providing consumers with quality and safe of mulberry fruit. Chemical methods are complex, time-consuming, and costly, and can result in sample contamination. Rapid detection of thiophanate-methyl residue on mulberry fruit was studied using laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) and hyperspectral imaging (HSI) techniques. Principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least square regression (PLSR) were used to qualitatively and quantitatively analyze the data obtained by using LIBS and HSI on mulberry fruit samples with different thiophanate-methyl residues. The competitive adaptive reweighted sampling algorithm was used to select optimal variables. The results of model calibration were compared. The best result was given by the PLSR model that used the optimal preprocessed LIBS-HSI variables, with a correlation coefficient of 0.921 for the prediction set. The results of this research confirmed the feasibility of using LIBS and HSI for the rapid detection of thiophanate-methyl residue on mulberry fruit."

The purpose of the study was to identify the influence of SCI on iron supplementation. A randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled experimental study was conducted among anaemic adolescent schoolgirls in Ayeyarwady region, Myanmar. A total of 402 schoolgirls were recruited from six schools screened from 1269 girls who were assigned into one of four groups: Folate group (2.5 mg of folate), Vitamin A group (15,000 IU of vitamin), Iron folate group (60 mg elemental iron and folate) and Iron, and vitamin A and folate group. Supplementation was done once a week for 12 weeks. Iron, vitamin A and inflammation were measured at the baseline, middle and endline. Changes in serum ferritin and body iron were significantly higher in the IFA and IFA + vitA among those without SCI. There was interaction between vitamin A and SCI on Hb changes. Analysis of GLM repeated measure showed interactions between treatment and SCI for hemoglobin and serum transferrin receptor. Those treated with vitamin A had better outcomes when there was SCI. Inflammation accompanied a negative effect on iron supplementation and vitamin A improved efficacy of iron supplementation in the presence of SCI.","A Meta-Analysis of the Rates of Suicide Ideation, Attempts and Deaths in People with Epilepsy.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022891,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 06 10,"This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the association between epilepsy and suicide. We systematically searched PubMed, PsycINFO, Embase and Web of Science for studies that reported the prevalence of suicidality in the form of suicide ideation, attempts and deaths among people with epilepsy (PWE). Studies were included if they reported the numbers of patients who died by suicide and concurrently suffered from epilepsy, assessed suicide ideation, or studied suicide attempts in PWE by validated instruments or diagnostic interviews. We used the random effects model to calculate the pooled odds ratios (OR) and standard mean differences (SMDs). We performed subgroup analyses. Seven case-control studies were included in the comparison of rates of suicide attempts between PWE and controls, with a total of 821,594 participants. Our analyses demonstrated a positive association between epilepsy and suicide attempts (pooled OR = 3.25, 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.69-3.92, p < 0.001), indicating that PWE have an elevated risk of suicide. The pooled prevalence for suicide ideation (24 studies) and suicide attempts (18 studies) were 23.2% (95% CI: 0.176-0.301) and 7.4% (95% CI: 0.031-0.169) respectively. The pooled rate of death due to suicide (10 studies) was 0.5% (95% CI: 0.002-0.016). Meta-regression showed that mean age and proportion of male gender were significant moderators for prevalence of suicide attempts and death due to suicide in PWE. Young PWE could be triggered by relationship problems and male PWE might use more lethal methods to attempt suicide. This meta-analysis provides the most up-to-date information on the prevalence of suicide among people with epilepsy and guidance on strategies to improve current psychiatric services provided for this population.",Polyaniline Functionalized Graphene Nanoelectrodes for the Regeneration of PC12 Cells via Electrical Stimulation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022890,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 06 10,"The regeneration of neurons is an important goal of neuroscience and clinical medicine.

We propose a new method combining the strengths of traditional laboratory studies where environment is strictly controlled, and field-based studies where subjects behave naturally. We use a foot-mounted inertial sensor, a GPS receiver and a barometric altitude sensor to reconstruct a subject's path and detailed foot movement, both indoors and outdoors, during days-long measurement using strapdown navigation and sensor fusion algorithms. We cluster repeated movement paths based on location, and propose that on these paths, most environmental and behavioral factors (e.g., terrain and motivation) are as repeatable as in a laboratory. During each bout of movement along a frequently repeated path, any synchronized measurement can be isolated for study, enabling focused statistical comparison of different interventions. We conducted a 10-day test on one subject wearing athletic shoes and sandals each for five days. The algorithm detected four frequently-repeated straight walking paths with at least 300 total steps and repetitions on at least three days for each condition. Results on these frequently-repeated paths indicated significantly lower foot clearance and shorter stride length and a trend toward decreased stride width when wearing athletic shoes vs. sandals. Comparisons based on all straight walking were similar, showing greater statistical power, but higher variability in the data. The proposed method offers a new way to evaluate how mobility interventions affect everyday movement behavior.","Coumarins and P450s, Studies Reported to-Date.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022888,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 10,"Cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs) are important phase I enzymes involved in the metabolism of endogenous and xenobiotic compounds mainly through mono-oxygenation reactions into more polar and easier to excrete species.

In 2011, a novel member of the Orthomyxoviridae family, Influenza D virus (IDV), was identified in the respiratory tract of swine. Epidemiological surveys revealed that IDV is distributed worldwide among livestock and that IDV-directed antibodies are detected in humans with occupational exposure to livestock. To identify the transmission capability of IDV to humans, we determined the viral replication kinetics and cell tropism using an in vitro respiratory epithelium model of humans. The inoculation of IDV revealed efficient replication kinetics and apical progeny virus release at different body temperatures. Intriguingly, the replication characteristics of IDV revealed higher replication kinetics compared to Influenza C virus, despite sharing the cell tropism preference for ciliated cells. Collectively, these results might indicate why IDV-directed antibodies are detected among humans with occupational exposure to livestock.","Improving Working Conditions to Promote Worker Safety, Health, and Wellbeing for Low-Wage Workers: The Workplace Organizational Health Study.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022886,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 06 10,"This paper addresses a significant gap in the literature by describing a study that tests the feasibility and efficacy of an organizational intervention to improve working conditions, safety, and wellbeing for low-wage food service workers. The Workplace Organizational Health Study tests the hypothesis that an intervention targeting the work organization and environment will result in improvements in workers' musculoskeletal disorders and wellbeing. This ongoing study is being conducted in collaboration with a large food service company. Formative evaluation was used to prioritize outcomes, assess working conditions, and define essential intervention elements. The theory-driven intervention is being evaluated in a proof-of-concept trial, conducted to demonstrate feasibility and potential efficacy using a cluster randomized design. Ten worksites were randomly assigned to intervention or control conditions. The 13-month intervention uses a comprehensive systems approach to improve workplace policies and practices. Using principles of participatory engagement, the intervention targets safety and ergonomics; work intensity; and job enrichment. The evaluation will provide a preliminary assessment of estimates of the intervention effect on targeted outcomes and inform understanding of the intervention implementation across worksites.

N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), widely used in medical treatments, offers an interesting approach to biofilm destruction. However, many Eubacteria strains are able to enzymatically decompose the NAC molecule. This is the first report on the action of two hybrid materials, NAC-Si-1 and NAC-Si-2, against bacteria isolated from a water environment: Agrobacterium tumefaciens, Aeromonas hydrophila, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter soli, Janthinobacterium lividum and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. The NAC was grafted onto functional siloxane polymers to reduce its availability to bacterial enzymes. The results confirm the bioactivity of NAC. However, the final effect of its action was environment- and strain-dependent. Moreover, all the tested bacterial strains showed the ability to degrade NAC by various metabolic routes.

Fatigue crack growth tests of 304 stainless steel specimens with the single crack and two parallel cracks have been conducted to confirm the numerical results. The numerical analysis results indicate that the interactions between the two parallel cracks have an enhancement or shielding effect on the stress intensity factors, depending on the relative positions of the cracks. The criterion diagram to determine the enhancement or shielding effect between two parallel cracks is obtained. The changes of the stress fields around the cracks have been studied to explain the mechanism of crack interactions.",Clustering Based Physical-Layer Authentication in Edge Computing Systems with Asymmetric Resources.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022882,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 10,"In this paper, we propose a clustering based physical-layer authentication scheme (CPAS) to overcome the drawback of traditional cipher-based authentication schemes that suffer from heavy costs and are limited by energy-constrained intelligent devices. CPAS is a novel cross-layer secure authentication approach for edge computing system with asymmetric resources. The CPAS scheme combines clustering and lightweight symmetric cipher with physical-layer channel state information to provide two-way authentication between terminals and edge devices. By taking advantage of temporal and spatial uniqueness in physical layer channel responses, the non-cryptographic physical layer authentication techniques can achieve fast authentication. The lightweight symmetric cipher initiates user authentication at the start of a session to establish the trust connection. Based on theoretical analysis, the CPAS scheme is secure and simple, but there is no trusted party, while it can also resist small integer attacks, replay attacks, and spoofing attacks. Besides, experimental results show that the proposed scheme can boost the total success rate of access authentication and decrease the data frame loss rate, without notable increase in authentication latencies."

Mitochondria are the main sources of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and ROS-induced oxidative stress is involved in cochlear damage. Moreover, the release of ROS causes further damage to mitochondrial components. Antioxidants are thought to counteract the deleterious effects of ROS and thus, may be effective for the treatment of oxidative stress-related diseases. The administration of mitochondria-targeted antioxidants is one of the drug delivery systems targeted to mitochondria. Mitochondria-targeted antioxidants are expected to help in the prevention and/or treatment of diseases associated with mitochondrial dysfunction. Of the various mitochondria-targeted antioxidants, the protective effects of MitoQ and SkQR1 against ototoxicity have been previously evaluated in animal models and/or mouse auditory cell lines. MitoQ protects against both gentamicin- and cisplatin-induced ototoxicity. SkQR1 also provides auditory protective effects against gentamicin-induced ototoxicity. On the other hand, decreasing effect of MitoQ on gentamicin-induced cell apoptosis in auditory cell lines has been controversial. No clinical studies have been reported for otoprotection using mitochondrial-targeted antioxidants. High-quality clinical trials are required to reveal the therapeutic effect of mitochondria-targeted antioxidants in terms of otoprotection in patients.",Microdroplet Synthesis of Silver Nanoparticles with Controlled Sizes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022869,Micromachines,2019 06 10,"A method was developed to synthesize silver nanoparticles with controlled size and Localized Surface Plasmon Resonance (LSPR) wavelength. In a microchip, droplets with high monodispersity and stability were produced. Using droplets as microreactors, seed-mediated growth approach was successfully applied for silver nanoparticles preparation. It was observed that nanoparticles size and LSPR wavelength could be optimized via adjusting synthesis conditions, such as droplets heating temperature, reaction time, and concentration of silver seeds and silver nitrate in aqueous phase. These results indicated that the proposed microdevices could provide a convenient and inexpensive approach for preparing nanoparticles with optimum properties.",Culicoides Biting Midges-Underestimated Vectors for Arboviruses of Public Health and Veterinary Importance.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022868,Viruses,2019 06 10,"Culicoides biting midges, small hematophagous dipterans, are the demonstrated or putative vectors of multiple arboviruses of veterinary and public health importance. Despite its relevance in disease spread, the ceratopogonid genus Culicoides is still a largely neglected group of species, predominantly because the major human-affecting arboviruses are considered to be transmitted by mosquitoes. However, when a pathogen is detected in a certain vector species, a thorough search for further vectors often remains undone and, therefore, the relevant vector species may remain unknown. Furthermore, for many hematophagous arthropods, true vector competence is often merely suspected and not experimentally proven. Therefore, we aim to illuminate the general impact of Culicoides biting midges and to summarize the knowledge about biting midge-borne disease agents using the order Bunyavirales, the largest and most diverse group of RNA viruses, as an example. When considering only viruses evidentially transmitted by Culicoides midges, the Simbu serogroup (genus Orthobunyavirus) is presumably the most important group within the virus order. Its members are of great veterinary importance, as a variety of simbuviruses, e.g., the species Akabane orthobunyavirus or Schmallenberg orthobunyavirus, induces severe congenital infections in pregnant animals. The major zoonotic representative of this serogroup occurs in South and Central America and causes the so-called Oropouche fever, an acute febrile illness in humans.","Assessment of Knowledge, Attitudes, and Behaviors toward Eating Disorders among Adolescents in Italy.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022867,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 06 10,"The objectives of this survey were to assess the knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors toward eating disorders among adolescents in Italy. The survey was undertaken between May and June 2017 among a random sample of 420 adolescents aged 14-20 years. Data were collected through a self-administered questionnaire. Only 22.8% correctly knew both the definition of anorexia and bulimia nervosa. Female, overweight or obese individuals, and who had at least one parent with a college degree or higher level of education were more likely to have this knowledge. More than one third (38.8%) had a fear of getting fat. Female, overweight or obese individuals, who did not know the definition of anorexia and bulimia nervosa, who avoided eating when they were hungry, and who always and usually were engaged in dieting behavior were more likely to have a fear of getting fat. Only 10.1% and 11.9% always and usually were engaged in dieting behavior, and 40.8% never did so. Respondents who usually/always had a strong desire to be thinner and who had a fear of getting fat were more likely to be engaged in dieting behavior. There is an urgent need to inform Italian adolescents about eating disorders, and healthcare workers may play a crucial role in distributing eating disorder-related knowledge.",The Role of the Immune System in Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022866,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 06 10,"Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) is the second most common skin cancer. In immunosuppressed populations it is a source of considerable morbidity and mortality due to its enhanced recurrence and metastatic potential. In common with many malignancies, leucocyte populations are both protective against cancer development and also play a role in 'sculpting' the nascent tumor, leading to loss of immunogenicity and tumor progression. UV radiation and chronic viral carriage may represent unique risk factors for cSCC development, and the immune system plays a key role in modulating the response to both. In this review, we discuss the lessons learned from animal and ex vivo human studies of the role of individual leucocyte subpopulations in the development of cutaneous SCC. We then discuss the insights into cSCC immunity gleaned from studies in humans, particularly in populations receiving pharmacological immunosuppression such as transplant recipients. Similar insights in other malignancies have led to exciting and novel immune therapies, which are beginning to emerge into the cSCC clinical arena.",Dietary Docosahexaenoic Acid (DHA) and Eicosapentaenoic Acid (EPA) Operate by Different Mechanisms to Modulate Hepatic Steatosis and Hyperinsulemia in fa/fa Zucker Rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022865,Nutrients,2019 06 10,"Hepatic steatosis, an early stage of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, is commonly present in obesity and type 2 diabetes, and is associated with reduced hepatic omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (n3-PUFA) status that impacts on the anti-inflammatory and insulin sensitizing functions of n3-PUFA. Our objective was to directly compare plant- and marine-based n3-PUFA (α-linoleic acid (ALA)), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)) for their effects on hepatic steatosis, markers of hepatic inflammation and fibrosis, and insulinemia in obese rats. Fa/fa Zucker rats were provided diets containing ALA, EPA, DHA, or linoleic acid (LA, n6-PUFA) for eight weeks and compared to baseline fa/fa rats and lean Zucker rats fed LA-rich diet for eight weeks. Both DHA and EPA groups had liver lipid similar to baseline, however, DHA was more effective than EPA for reducing hepatic fatty acid synthase (FAS), increasing the proportion of smaller lipid droplets, reversing early fibrotic damage, and reducing fasting hyperinsulinemia. EPA was more effective for reducing FoxO1. Dietary ALA did not attenuate hepatic steatosis, most inflammatory markers or FAS. In summary, amongst the n3-PUFA, DHA was the most effective for elevating hepatic DHA levels, and preventing progression of hepatic steatosis via reductions in FAS and a marker of fibrosis.","Old Molecule, New Chemistry: Exploring Silicon Phthalocyanines as Emerging N-Type Materials in Organic Electronics.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022864,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 10,Efficient synthesis of silicon phthalocyanines (SiPc) eliminating the strenuous reaction conditions and hazardous reagents required by classical methods is described.

One vulnerable group at risk of marketplace exclusion are employees with disabilities. This research explores their job motivation, including the moderated effect of self-efficacy. A 187 employees from Special Employment Centers (SECs) in Spain with intellectual and physical disabilities completed the Internal Motivation Scale, the Psychological Critical States (PCS) and the self-efficacy sub-scale of the Psychological Processes Scale (PPS) tests. Following the International Tests Commission guidelines, the instruments were adapted to the special needs of the participants. We found differences depending on the kind of disability of employees. In employees with intellectual disabilities, their levels of self-efficacy moderated the effect of responsibility for outcomes and meaningfulness of work on motivation. In the case of employees with physical disabilities, the knowledge of results is a predictor of motivation when they had medium or high levels of self-efficacy. Additionally, in this group, responsibility for outcomes and meaningfulness of work had a direct effect on motivation, independently of their levels of self-efficacy. Employees with disabilities should be empowered to make choices and exercise control in their working lives. To do so, human resources managers should promote their wellbeing, taking into consideration the workforce diversity.",A Study on the Dimension Accuracy on the Inner Structure of the 3D Printed Parts Caused by the Scanning Strategy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022861,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 10,"Selective laser melting (SLM) has been used in many fields recently, especially in the aerospace field.

In this work, the dimension accuracy of the inner structure was measured and compared using different scanning strategies. Compared with the measured data, a new scanning strategy was used and finds that the dimension accuracy was better than the previous one that used a two-scanning strategy. To explain this phenomenon, finite element analysis (FEA) was used to show the temperature distribution after a 0.1 s cooling using two different scanning strategies, which caused the dimensional deviation in printing."

Several commercial and laboratory-made solid formulations for mass production of Trichoderma have been reported. In this study, we evaluated a solid kaolin-based formulation to promote the absortion/retention of Trichoderma asperellum in the substrate for growing tomato plants. The unique implementation of this solid formulation resulted in an increased growth of the tomato plants, both in roots and shoots after 40 days of its application. Plants were challenged with two fungal pathogens, Fusarium oxysporum and Botrytis cinerea, and pretreatment with T. asperellum resulted in less severe wilting and stunting symptoms than non-treated plants. Treatment with T. asperellum formulation inhibited Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) production in response to the pathogens in comparison to plants that were only challenged with both pathogens. These results suggest that decrease in ROS levels contribute to the protective effects exerted by T. asperellum in tomato.","Alkaline Extraction, Structural Characterization, and Bioactivities of (1→6)-β-d-Glucan from Lentinus edodes.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022848,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 10,"The purpose of this study is to develop a robust approach to obtain β glucans from Lentinus edodes and to characterize their structural and biological properties for sustainable utilization. The alkali extraction was optimized with an orthogonal experimental design, and a concise process for obtaining specific targeting polysaccharides from Lentinus edodes was developed in this study. After purification with a Q-Sepharose Fast Flow strong anion-exchange column, the monosaccharide composition, a methylation analysis, and NMR spectroscopy were employed for their structural characterizations. LeP-N2 was found to be composed of (1→6)-β-d-glucans with minor β-(1→3) glucosidic side chains. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and high-performance gel permeation chromatography-refractive index-multi-angle laser light scattering (HPGPC-RI-MALLS) also revealed LeP-N2 exhibiting a compact unit in aqueous solution. This (1→6)-β-d-glucan was tested for antioxidant activities with IC50 at 157 μg/mL. Moreover, RAW 264.7 macrophage activation indicated that the release of nitric oxide (NO) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) was markedly increased with no cytotoxicity at a dose of 100 μg/mL. These findings suggest that the (1→6)-β-d-glucans obtained from Lentinus edodes could serve as potential agents in the fields of functional foods or medicine.",Characterized Bioelectric Signals by Means of Neural Networks and Wavelets to Remotely Control a Human-Machine Interface.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022847,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 10,"Everyday, people interact with different types of human machine interfaces, and the use of them is increasing, thus, it is necessary to design interfaces which are capable of responding in an intelligent, natural, inexpensive, and accessible way, regardless of social, cultural, economic, or physical features of a user. In this sense, it has been sought out the development of small interfaces to avoid any type of user annoyance. In this paper, bioelectric signals have been analyzed and characterized in order to propose a more natural human-machine interaction system. The proposed scheme is controlled by electromyographic signals that a person can create through arm movements. Such arm signals have been analyzed and characterized by a back-propagation neural network, and by a wavelet analysis, in this way control commands were obtained from such arm electromyographic signals. The developed interface, uses Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) to send control commands remotely. In the experiment, it manipulated a vehicle that was approximately 52 km away from the user, with which it can be showed that a characterized electromyographic signal can be sufficient for controlling embedded devices such as a Raspberri Pi, and in this way we can use the neural network and the wavelet analysis to generate control words which can be used inside the Internet of Things too. A Tiva-C board has been used to acquire data instead of more popular development boards, with an adequate response. One of the most important aspects related to the proposed interface is that it can be used by almost anyone, including people with different abilities and even illiterate people. Due to the existence of individual efforts to characterize different types of bioelectric signals, we propose the generation of free access Bioelectric Control Dictionary, to define and consult each characterized biosignal.",Camptothecin Induces PD-L1 and Immunomodulatory Cytokines in Colon Cancer Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022845,"Medicines (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 30,":Background: Immunotherapy has changed the options for the treatment of various cancer types, but not colon cancer. Current checkpoint blockade approaches are ineffective in a large proportion of colon cancer cases, necessitating studies to elucidate its mechanisms and to identify new targets and strategies against it. Methods: Here, we examined Programmed Death-Ligand 1(PD-L1), cytokine and receptor responses of colon cancer cells exposed to camptothecin (CPT), a clinically used topoisomerase inhibitor. Colon cancer cells were treated with CPT at concentrations of up to 10 µM, and the expressions of PD-L1 and immunoregulatory cytokine genes and receptors were analyzed. Results: PD-L1, a current immunotherapy target for various cancers, was shown to be upregulated in colon cancer cells independent of the cellular p53 status. In metastasis-derived SW620 cells, CPT most extensively upregulated cytokines with T-cell attraction or growth factor functions. Of those modulated genes, SPP1, IL1RN, IL1A, TNFSF13B, OSM, and CSF3 had the most clinical relevance, as their high expression was associated with poor cancer patient overall survival. Conclusions: These findings highlight the need to examine, in preclinical and clinical situations, the potential benefits of combining topoisomerase inhibitors with immune-checkpoint inhibitors.",Hedgehog Signaling and Embryonic Craniofacial Disorders.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022843,Journal of developmental biology,2019 04 26,"Since its initial discovery in a Drosophila mutagenesis screen, the Hedgehog pathway has been revealed to be instrumental in the proper development of the vertebrate face. Vertebrates possess three hedgehog paralogs: Sonic hedgehog (Shh), Indian hedgehog (Ihh), and Desert hedgehog (Dhh). Of the three, Shh has the broadest range of functions both in the face and elsewhere in the embryo, while Ihh and Dhh play more limited roles. The Hedgehog pathway is instrumental from the period of prechordal plate formation early in the embryo, until the fusion of the lip and secondary palate, which complete the major patterning events of the face. Disruption of Hedgehog signaling results in an array of developmental disorders in the face, ranging from minor alterations in the distance between the eyes to more serious conditions such as severe clefting of the lip and palate. Despite its critical role, Hedgehog signaling seems to be disrupted through a number of mechanisms that may either be direct, as in mutation of a downstream target of the Hedgehog ligand, or indirect, such as mutation in a ciliary protein that is otherwise seemingly unrelated to the Hedgehog pathway. A number of teratogens such as alcohol, statins and steroidal alkaloids also disrupt key aspects of Hedgehog signal transduction, leading to developmental defects that are similar, if not identical, to those of Hedgehog pathway mutations. The aim of this review is to highlight the variety of roles that Hedgehog signaling plays in developmental disorders of the vertebrate face.",Capsaicin Analogues Derived from n-3 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids (PUFAs) Reduce Inflammatory Activity of Macrophages and Stimulate Insulin Secretion by β-Cells In Vitro.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022842,Nutrients,2019 06 10,"In this study, two capsaicin analogues, N-eicosapentaenoyl vanillylamine (EPVA) and N-docosahexaenoyl vanillylamine (DHVA), were enzymatically synthesized from their corresponding n-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), both dietary relevant components. The compounds significantly reduced the production of some lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory mediators, including nitric oxide (NO), macrophage-inflammatory protein-3α (CCL20) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1 or CCL2), by RAW264.7 macrophages. Next to this, only EPVA increased insulin secretion by pancreatic INS-1 832/13 β-cells, while raising intracellular Ca2+ and ATP concentrations. This suggests that the stimulation of insulin release occurs through an increase in the intracellular ATP/ADP ratio in the first phase, while is calcium-mediated in the second phase. Although it is not yet known whether EPVA is endogenously produced, its potential therapeutic value for diabetes treatment merits further investigation.","Medicine Prices, Availability, and Affordability in Private Health Facilities in Low-Income Settlements in Nairobi County, Kenya.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022841,"Pharmacy (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 26,"Medicine prices are a major determinant of access to healthcare. Owing to low availability of medicines in the public health facilities and poor accessibility to these facilities, most low-income residents pay out-of-pocket for health services and transport to the private health facilities. In low-income settlements, high retail prices are likely to push the population further into poverty and ill health. This study assessed the retail pricing, availability, and affordability of medicines in private health facilities in low-income settlements within Nairobi County. Medicine prices and availability data were collected between September and December 2016 at 45 private healthcare facilities in 14 of Nairobi's low-income settlements using electronic questionnaires. The International Medical Products Price Guide provided international medicine reference prices for comparison. Affordability and availability proxies were calculated according to existing methods. Innovator brands were 13.8 times more expensive than generic brands. The lowest priced generics and innovator brands were, on average, sold at 2.9 and 32.6 times the median international reference prices of corresponding medicines. Assuming a 100% disposable income, it would take 0.03 to 1.33 days' wages for the lowest paid government employee to pay for treatment courses of selected single generic medicines. Medicine availability in the facilities ranged between 2% and 76% (mean 43%) for indicator medicines. Prices of selected medicines varied within the 14 study regions. Retail medicine prices in the low-income settlements studied were generally higher than corresponding international reference prices. Price variations were observed across different regions although the regions comprise similar socioeconomic populations. These factors are likely to impact negatively on healthcare access.",Structural Identification of Antibacterial Lipids from Amazonian Palm Tree Endophytes through the Molecular Network Approach.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022840,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 06 10,A library of 197 endophytic fungi and bacteria isolated from the Amazonian palm tree Astrocaryum sciophilum was extracted and screened for antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Four out of five antibacterial ethyl acetate extracts were also cytotoxic for the MRC-5 cells line. Liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (UPHLC-HRMS/MS) analyses combined with molecular networking data processing were carried out to allow the identification of depsipeptides and cyclopeptides responsible for the cytotoxicity in the dataset. Specific ion clusters from the active Luteibacter sp. extract were also highlighted using an MRSA activity filter.

Endothelial dysfunction, also caused by dysregulation of glutathione homeostasis expressed as ratio between its reduced (GSH) and its oxidised form (GSSG), could represent one of the pathogenic triggers of AVSc. We prospectively enrolled 58 patients with overt atherosclerosis and requiring coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). The incidence of AVSc in the studied population was 50%. The two groups (No-AVSc and AVSc) had similar clinical characteristics. Pre-operatively, AVSc group showed significantly lower GSH/GSSG ratio than No-AVSc group (p = 0.02). Asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) concentration was significantly higher in AVSc patients compared to No-AVSc patients (p < 0.0001). Explanted sclerotic aortic valves presented a significantly increased protein glutathionylation (Pr-SSG) than No-AVSc ones (p = 0.01). In vitro, inhibition of glutathione reductase caused β-actin glutathionylation, activation of histone 2AX, upregulation of α2 smooth muscle actin (ACTA2), downregulation of platelet and endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1 (PECAM1) and cadherin 5 (CDH5). In this study, we showed for the first time that the dysregulation of glutathione homeostasis is associated with AVSc. We found that Pr-SSG is increased in AVSc leaflets and it could lead to EndMT via DNA damage. Further studies are warranted to elucidate the causal role of Pr-SSG in aortic valve degeneration."

The PEERS program will be piloted with adolescents and young women with TS aged 16-20 using an uncontrolled study trial with a multiple-case series design. The program will be delivered face to face and online. The assessment battery is designed to measure social skills comprehensively from diverse informants (parent, teacher young person).

This technology is particularly valuable for characterization of tissue heterogeneity because it can be used to identify and classify all cell types in a tissue. This is generally done by clustering the data, based on the assumption that cells of a particular type share similar transcriptomes, distinct from other cell types in the tissue. However, nearly all clustering algorithms have tunable parameters which affect the number of clusters they will identify in data. The R Shiny software tool described here, scClustViz, provides a simple interactive graphical user interface for exploring scRNAseq data and assessing the biological relevance of clustering results. Given that cell types are expected to have distinct gene expression patterns, scClustViz uses differential gene expression between clusters as a metric for assessing the fit of a clustering result to the data at multiple cluster resolution levels. This helps select a clustering parameter for further analysis. scClustViz also provides interactive visualisation of: cluster-specific distributions of technical factors, such as predicted cell cycle stage and other metadata; cluster-wise gene expression statistics to simplify annotation of cell types and identification of cell type specific marker genes; and gene expression distributions over all cells and cell types. scClustViz provides an interactive interface for visualisation, assessment, and biological interpretation of cell-type classifications in scRNAseq experiments that can be easily added to existing analysis pipelines, enabling customization by bioinformaticians while enabling biologists to explore their results without the need for computational expertise.

Differential gene expression analysis (DGEA) is the first step in the course of data interpretation, typically producing lists of dozens to thousands of differentially expressed genes. To further guide the interpretation of these lists, different pathway analysis approaches have been developed. These tools typically rely on the classification of genes into sets of genes, such as pathways, based on the interactions between the genes and their function in a common biological process. Regardless of technical differences, these methods do not properly account for cross talk between different pathways and most of the methods rely on binary separation into differentially expressed gene and unaffected genes based on an arbitrarily set p-value cut-off. To overcome this limitation, we developed a novel approach to identify concertedly modulated sub-graphs in the global cell signaling network, based on the DGEA results of all genes tested. To this end, expression patterns of genes are integrated according to the topology of their interactions and allow potentially to read the flow of information and identify the effectors.

DAN’s intention is for this annual publication to enhance awareness of dive injuries and give divers the insights they need to better avoid emergencies. DAN received notification of 169 deaths involving recreational scuba diving in 2016. The largest numbers of reported fatalities occurred in Florida and California, with 20 and 7 fatalities respectively. The geospatial distribution of the reported fatalities by region is: 72 in North America, 27 in Europe, 23 in Oceania, 19 in the Caribbean, 18 in Asia, 4 in South America, and 1 each in Northern Africa, Southern Africa, the Middle East and Central America. The location was unknown in two cases. Diving injury data analyzed in this report comes mainly from DAN’s Medical Services Call Center (MSCC) and its annual survey of hyperbaric chambers. Section 2, Diving Injuries, categorizes the types of injuries managed by DAN Medical Services and includes summaries of actual cases. In 2016, there were 10,320 calls or emails to the MSCC from divers who needed assistance, information or consultation; 59% of these cases were dive-related, and 41% were not. The most common dive-related health issues discussed during these calls were barotrauma, decompression sickness and marine envenomations. The Diving Incident Reporting System (DIRS) collects diving incident reports through the DAN website, www.DAN.org. Divers worldwide are encouraged to report any incidents that occur during dives via this system. Of the 102 incidents reported in 2016, 91 involved open-circuit scuba diving, 5 involved rebreather diving, and 6 involved breath-hold diving. In addition to the injury surveillance data collected by DAN in Durham, North Carolina, additional injury surveillance data analyzed in this report was contributed by DAN-affiliated agencies and other organizations around the world. Section 5 features reports from DAN Europe, DAN Japan and DAN Asia Pacific. Other organizations that reported their findings were the British Sub-Aqua Club (BSAC), New Zealand Underwater Association, the Irish Underwater Council and the Underwater Council of British Columbia. Although scuba diving accidents can be fatal, many can be prevented with safe diving practices and by understanding how to identify hazards and avoid or mitigate the risks that cause accidents. The DAN Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment Program enables divers and dive operators to recognize and avoid these risks; this program is described in Appendix B: DAN Operational Safety Programs. DAN exists to provide divers with the resources they need to make every dive accident- and injury-free. When accidents cannot be prevented, DAN is here to provide divers with emergency assistance no matter where in the world they are. With the support of all the DAN offices and contributors worldwide, DAN is committed to providing resources that will resonate with and be useful to divers everywhere.",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31021586,,2019 05 21,"Experiences of hearing the voice of God (or angels, demons, or other spiritual beings) have generally been understood either as religious experiences or else as a feature of mental illness. Some critics of traditional religious faith have dismissed the visions and voices attributed to biblical characters and saints as evidence of mental disorder. However, it is now known that many ordinary people, with no other evidence of mental disorder, also hear voices and that these voices not infrequently include spiritual or religious content. Psychological and interdisciplinary research has shed a revealing light on these experiences in recent years, so that we now know much more about the phenomenon of “hearing voices” than ever before. The present work considers biblical, historical, and scientific accounts of spiritual and mystical experiences of voice hearing in the Christian tradition in order to explore how some voices may be understood theologically as revelatory. It is proposed that in the incarnation, Christian faith finds both an understanding of what it is to be fully human (a theological anthropology), and God’s perfect self-disclosure (revelation). Within such an understanding, revelatory voices represent a key point of interpersonal encounter between human beings and God.",Long-term effectiveness of cinacalcet in non-dialysis patients with chronic kidney disease and secondary hyperparathyroidism.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022778,Kidney research and clinical practice,2019 06 14,Secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) is a common complication of chronic kidney disease (CKD).

A cross sectional study involving 43 women with PCOS and 39 normal women was carried out over a period of nine months. Fasting glucose and insulin levels, lipid parameters and androgen levels were measured in all serum samples. HMWA was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and IR was estimated using the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) index. The IR was more prevalent in the PCOS group than in the controls (p=0.002). Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, sex hormone binding globulin, free androgen index, total testosterone, insulin, and HOMA-IR levels were significantly higher in the PCOS group as compared to the control group (all p<0.05). Moreover, HMWA was significantly lower and negatively correlated with the clinical and biochemical hyperandrogenism in the PCOS group. HMWA and HOMA-IR were also associated with triglyceride, body mass index, and fat mass in this group. ROC curve analyses demonstrated that the AUC, indicative of the HMWA value for discriminating PCOS with IR, was 0.725, with a confidence interval of 0.615-0.835 (p=0.001). The serum HMWA levels are lower in patients with PCOS, which suggest that HMWA might be involved in the pathogenesis of PCOS.

Only 5 studies reported accuracy indicators and were included in the bivariate random-effects model; with a total of 509 samples that included 332 (65.22%) confirmed PCOS women. The sensitivity of serum PSA for the diagnosis of PCOS varied between 66.3 and 90.6%, and, the specificity ranged from 62.5-86.7%.

Condensed matter : an Institute of Physics journal,2019 06 04,"Pure spin current is of great importance in spintronics and may be achieved by spin dependent Seebeck effect (SDSE) in magnetic systems. Zigzag-edged graphene nanoribbons (ZGNRs) are very well-known 2D magnetic nanostructures. However, perfect and pristine ZGNRs either in the anti-ferromagnetic ground state or in the ferromagnetic (FM) state are not capable of producing pure spin current by SDSE at low temperature. In this work, by density functional theory calculations, we propose a scheme for generating pure spin current using SDSE in FM-ZGNRs by introducing antidots. Specifically, by creating a hexagonal antidot with either armchair edges or zigzag edges in the scattering region, we can get finite Seebeck thermopower for both spin channels with opposite signs, leading to the opposite flow directions of the two spin channels. The mechanism is well explained by the cooperation of the varying localization features of states around the Fermi level and the antidot induced scattering potential. By slightly tuning the chemical potential, pure spin current can be achieved. The size and edge shape effects have also been systematically studied. The findings indicate a novel scheme for thermally generating pure spin current in zigzag graphene nanoribbons and may find important application in graphene based spintronics.",Nanofabricated tips for device-based scanning tunneling microscopy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022709,Nanotechnology,2019 05 30,"We report on the fabrication and performance of a new kind of tip for scanning tunneling microscopy.

In this review, we summarize the required properties of a quantum fidelity measure, and compare them, to determine which properties each of the different measures has. We show that there are large classes of measures that satisfy all the required properties of a fidelity measure, just as there are many norms of Hilbert space operators, and many measures of entropy. We compare these fidelities, with detailed proofs of their properties.

An in vitro model using polyester mesh was established, allowing the study of the local contact during 48 h between a BOEC monolayer and early embryos (2- or 8-cell stage) or their respective conditioned media (CM). The transcriptomic response of BOEC to early embryos was assessed by analyzing the transcript abundance of SMAD6, TDGF1, ROCK1, ROCK2, SOCS3, PRELP and AGR3 selected from previous in vivo studies and GPX4, NFE2L2, SCN9A, EPSTI1, IGFBP3 selected from in vitro studies. Moreover, metabolic analyses were performed on the media obtained from the co-culture. Results revealed that presence of early embryos or their CM altered the BOEC expression of NFE2L2, GPX4, SMAD6, IGFBP3, ROCK2 and SCN9A. However, the response of BOEC to 2-cell embryos or their CM was different from that observed to 8-cell embryos or their CM. Analysis of energy substrates and amino acids revealed that BOEC metabolism was not affected by the presence of early embryos or by their CM. Interestingly, embryo metabolism before embryo genome activation (EGA) seems to be independent of exogenous sources of energy. In conclusion, this study confirms that early embryos affect BOEC transcriptome and BOEC response was embryo stage-specific. Moreover, embryo affects BOEC via a direct contact or via its secretions. However transcriptomic response of BOEC to the embryo did not manifest as an observable metabolic response.",Basophils Are Dispensable for the Control of a Filarial Infection.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022700,ImmunoHorizons,2019 04 25,"Basophils are innate effector cells that contribute to allergic reactions and provide protection against parasites. Using basophil-deficient Mcpt8-cre mice, we have previously shown that these granulocytes contributed to the immune mediated early control of the gastrointestinal helminth Strongyloides ratti in mice. In this study, we analyze the impact of basophils on the immune response and defense against the tissue-dwelling filarial helminth parasite Litomosoides sigmodontis Although basophils and IgE increased at the site of infection, the absence of basophils did not change the outcome of L. sigmodontis infection. Worm burden in the thoracic cavity and microfilaremiae in the peripheral blood were alike in L. sigmodontis-infected Mcpt8-cre mice compared with Mcpt8 wild type littermates during the entire course of infection. Analysis of the cytokine and Ab response to L. sigmodontis revealed no consistent alterations in the absence of basophils. Furthermore, basophil-deficient and -competent mice were protected to the same extent during a secondary infection with L. sigmodontis In summary, our findings suggest that basophils are dispensable for the initiation of the appropriate immune response and host defense against Lsigmodontis infection in mice.",LP-BM5 Retrovirus-Expanded Monocytic Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cells Alter B Cell Phenotype and Function.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022699,ImmunoHorizons,2019 04 25,"Our laboratory demonstrated that infection with the murine retrovirus LP-BM5 results in increased numbers of monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (M-MDSCs) and that these M-MDSCs suppress not only T but also B cell responses. Because of the paucity of studies regarding the effects of MDSCs in general on B cells, we focused on these understudied B cell targets for M-MDSC effects on B cell phenotypic and functional parameters. M-MDSCs specifically decreased the proliferation of transitional type 2 (T2) B cells in response to polyclonal stimulation but increased germinal center and Ab-secreting B cell proportions and class-switched Ig production. Additionally, M-MDSCs inhibited the expression of CD40 and MHC class II on stimulated B cells and suppressed Ag presentation to Ag-specific CD4+ T cells. These alterations of the B cell compartment coincided with decreases in aerobic glycolysis, mitochondrial respiration, and glucose consumption; the latter specifically decreased in the T2 subset. To compare B cell targets of ex vivo M-MDSC suppression with the status of B cells during the course of LP-BM5-induced pathogenesis, including immunodeficiency in vivo, B cells from LP-BM5-infected mice were collected and analyzed. LP-BM5 infection resulted in several analogous alterations of B cells, as were observed with retrovirally expanded M-MDSC suppression in vitro, including decreased proliferation of T2 B cells, an increased proportion of germinal center and Ab-secreting B cells, increased production of class-switched Abs, decreased expression of CD40, and decreased metabolic activity upon stimulation."

Five simple, fast and accurate spectrophotometric methods using spectral factor manipulation have been tested and validated so as to determine quantitatively a new fixed-dose combination tablet containing both amlodipine besylate (ADB) and rosuvastatin calcium (ROS). Namely, these methods are induced dual wavelength, absorbance correction, absorbance subtraction, amplitude correction and advanced amplitude subtraction. Their corresponding spectral factors are equality, absorption, absorbance, amplitude and unity factor, respectively. Calibration curves of ADB and ROS were set up for all the previously mentioned methods under the optimum conditions in a concentration range of 3.0-21.0 μg/mL with correlation coefficients ≥0.9990. Selectivity was calculated by analyzing laboratory-prepared synthetic blends of the cited drugs. A comparative study between these methods and the reported ones has been carried out statistically forming a judgment that the difference between both results is totally insignificant. Actually, the suggested spectral factor technique is so effective for use in routine laboratory essay owing to its simplicity, rapidity and precision. Generally, the proposed factor procedures have the ability to run smoothly without any interference from additives that may deteriorate analysis efficiency of a pharmaceutical combination.","Luminescent properties of new 2,2-, 2,3- and 3,3-CH2-bis(BODIPY)s dyes: Structural and solvation effects.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022681,"Spectrochimica acta.

Work in this vein has examined two principal input sources - the role of visual and haptic information on balance. Recent work has explored the impact of a different form of haptic input - object holding - on balance in young infants. Research question This experiment examined the impact of simultaneous visual input and haptic input on balance in children and adults, employing two novel forms of haptic input. Methods Static balance was measured in 3-5 year olds, 7-9 year olds, and young adults, in the presence of all possible combinations of manipulated visual input (eyes open, eyes closed) and haptic input (no touch, object hold, touch an unstable support, touch a stable support). Results Analysis of postural stability (mean velocity) indicated that stability was influenced by visual input, haptic input, and age group. For visual input stability increased in eyes open versus eyes closed conditions. For haptic input, stability systematically increased with increasing levels of fixed haptic input (e.g., no touch, object hold, unstable touch, stable touch). Stability also increased as a function of increasing age group. There were no interactions between the factors. Significance The finding that the two novel forms of haptic input - object hold and touch with an unstable support surface - increased stability relative to no touch input, but not as much as touch with a stable support, indicates that children use haptic information in a self-referential fashion for controlling posture. The failure to observe any interactions between visual and haptic inputs with age suggests that multisensory processing is generally additive across development, and has implications for the occurrence of sensory weighting across developmental epochs.",The effects of textured materials on static balance in healthy young and older adults: A systematic review with meta-analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022658,Gait & posture,2019 05 31,"Standing on textured materials can improve static balance, potentially by modulating somatosensory inputs from the soles of the feet.",Gastroschisis during gestation: prognostic factors of neonatal mortality from prenatal care to postsurgery.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022657,"European journal of obstetrics, gynecology, and reproductive biology",2019 05 24,"To evaluate the prognostic factors related to mortality in neonates with gastroschisis, ranging from prenatal care to corrective surgery.",Objective assessment of total laparoscopic hysterectomy: Development and validation of a feasible rating scale for formative and summative feedback.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022656,"European journal of obstetrics, gynecology, and reproductive biology",2019 05 24,The aims of the study were to develop and gather validity evidence for a feasible rating scale for formative and summative assessment of total laparoscopic hysterectomy in the operating theatre.,Risk of cesarean after induction of labor in twin compared to singleton pregnancies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022655,"European journal of obstetrics, gynecology, and reproductive biology",2019 05 24,To assess the risk of cesarean delivery after induction of labor in twin compared with singleton pregnancies.,Ammonia toxicity in the mud crab (Scylla paramamosain): The mechanistic insight from physiology to transcriptome analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022654,Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,2019 05 15,"Ammonia is a major aquatic environmental pollutants. However, the underlying molecular mechanism of ammonia-induced toxicity is not fully understood. In this study, we investigated the physiological response and molecular mechanism in mud crab (Scylla paramamosain) exposed to the acute total ammonia (30 mg L-1) for 48 h. The results shown that ammonia exposure induced oxidative stress, and subsequently led to cytological damage and DNA damage. Transcriptome analysis was applied to investigate the key genes and pathways involved in the responses to ammonia exposure. A total of 722 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (526 up-regulated and 196 down-regulated) were identified. DEGs mainly involved in pathways including metabolism, cellular processes, signal transduction and immune functions.

The contributions to Cs uptake of a K-transporter-mediated high-affinity transport system and a K-channel-mediated low-affinity transport system in the two plants were compared and analyzed. The difference between the two plants in the mechanism of Cs uptake was further analyzed using transcription sequence technology. The results show that the transfer characteristics of Cs in the two plants had a similar distribution relationship with K. The contribution rate of the K-channel pathway to Cs uptake was 32.00% in the V. faba seedling roots, which was significantly higher than for B. juncea (9.81%) (P < 0.01); the contribution rate of the K-transporter pathway to Cs uptake of the B. juncea seedlings was 32.08%, which was significantly higher than that of the V. faba seedlings (17.13%)(P < 0.05). Other uptake pathways also mediated the uptake of Cs by roots in B. juncea and V. faba (contribution rate: 54.92-60.09% and 42.18-59.73%, respectively). The transcriptome sequencing results confirmed that Cs-induced treatment significantly inhibited the expression of the K-transporter protein and K-channel protein-related genes in the V. faba roots, but it had no significant effect on the expression of related genes in the B. juncea roots. Thus, one reason for the significant difference between the two plant in the accumulation of Cs is that Cs inhibited the expression of related transporter protein genes in the V. faba roots.",Inorganic and organic fertilizers application enhanced antibiotic resistome in greenhouse soils growing vegetables.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022652,Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,2019 05 15,"Antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB) in fertilizers pose risks to human health and their variation in soil after fertilization has been reported. However, some important questions, such as the origin of ARG and ARB observed in soil following fertilization, which are present in soil regardless of fertilizer type (i.e., core (shared) ARGs and ARB), and the contribution of various ARG subtypes to the soil antibiotic resistome, need to be addressed. In this study, the effects of a long-term (9-year) application of organic (manure) and inorganic (chemistry) fertilizers on ARGs in greenhouse soils growing vegetables were investigated using metagenomic sequencing. The results showed that both organic and inorganic fertilizers application increased the diversity and abundance of soil ARGs. The dominant ARG types in organic fertilizer (OF) were different from that in organic fertilizer treated soil (SO), inorganic fertilizer treated soil (SI) and no fertilizer control plots (SC). The difference of core ARGs abundance reflected the variation of ARG profiles among SC, SI and SO. The OF is likely a source of the elevated ARG subtypes in soil and almost all the soil core ARG subtypes can be detected in organic fertilizer. Fifteen ARG types were enriched in the soil with OF, and some ARG subtypes such as sul1, sul2, tetX and tetL might derived from OF while others including as vanR, tcmA, rosB, and mexF might be from indigenous microbes in soil. The nutrition factors were found to influence the ARG profiles in fertilized soil. In summary, this study revealed the possible reason for the soil total ARG numbers and their relative abundance increase after fertilization, which will facilitate the control of ARGs and ARB dissemination."

Compared with the single-component photocatalysts, heterostructures of different semiconductors have been widely used to improve the photocatalytic performance. In this work, we fabricate a hetero-structured photocatalyst consisting of two-dimensional graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) nanosheets and commercial MoO3 microparticles through a simple mixing and annealing process. The photocatalytic performance was evaluated in various dye degradation reactions, especially Rhodamine (RhB) degradation. The MoO3/g-C3N4 composite shown a significant improvement compared with individual MoO3 or g-C3N4 as well as their physical mixture. By applying electron spin resonance (ESR) spin-trap spectra, radical scavenge experiments and electrochemical analysis, we find that a direct Z-scheme charge transfer between MoO3 and g-C3N4 not only causes an accumulation of electrons in g-C3N4 and holes in MoO3, but also boosts the formation of superoxide radical and hydroxyl radical. The superoxide radical and hole dominate the photocatalytic degradation, while the hydroxyl radical plays a negligible role and its production can be suppressed by lowering the pH value.",A deep network for tissue microstructure estimation using modified LSTM units.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022640,Medical image analysis,2019 05 26,"Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) offers a unique tool for noninvasively assessing tissue microstructure. However, accurate estimation of tissue microstructure described by complicated signal models can be challenging when a reduced number of diffusion gradients are used. Deep learning based microstructure estimation has recently been developed and achieved promising results. In particular, optimization-based learning, where deep network structures are constructed by unfolding the iterative processes performed for solving optimization problems, has demonstrated great potential in accurate microstructure estimation with a reduced number of diffusion gradients. In this work, using the optimization-based learning strategy, we propose a deep network structure that is motivated by the use of historical information in iterative optimization for tissue microstructure estimation, and such incorporation of historical information has not been previously explored in the design of deep networks for microstructure estimation. We assume that (1) diffusion signals can be sparsely represented by a dictionary and its coefficients jointly in the spatial and angular domain, and (2) tissue microstructure can be computed from the sparse representation. Following these assumptions, our network comprises two cascaded stages. The first stage takes image patches as input and computes the spatial-angular sparse representation of the input with learned weights. Specifically, the network structure in the first stage is constructed by unfolding an iterative process for solving sparse reconstruction problems, where historical information is incorporated. The components in this network can be shown to correspond to modified long short-term memory (LSTM) units. In the second stage, fully connected layers are added to compute the mapping from the sparse representation to tissue microstructure. The weights in the two stages are learned jointly by minimizing the mean squared error of microstructure estimation. Experiments were performed on dMRI scans with a reduced number of diffusion gradients. For demonstration, we evaluated the estimation of tissue microstructure described by three signal models: the neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) model, the spherical mean technique (SMT) model, and the ensemble average propagator (EAP) model. The results indicate that the proposed approach outperforms competing methods.",A kernel-based image denoising method for improving parametric image generation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022639,Medical image analysis,2019 05 26,"One of the main challenges in the pixel-wise modeling analysis is the presence of high noise levels. Wang and Qi proposed a kernel-based method for dynamic positron emission tomgraphy reconstruction. Inspired by this method, we propose a kernel-based image denoising method based on the minimization of a kernel-based lp-norm regularized problem. To solve the kernel-based image denoising problem, we used the general-threshold filtering algorithm in combination with total difference. In the present study, we investigated whether diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) data denoised using the proposed method can provide improved intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) parametric images. We also compared the proposed method with the method using the local principal component analysis (LPCA). The simulated DW-MR magnitude images are assumed to have Rician distributed noise. Computer simulations show that the proposed image denoising method can achieve a better bias-variance trade-off than the LPCA method. Moreover, the proposed method can reduce variance while simultaneously preserving edges in the parametric images. We tested our image denoising method on in vivo DW-MRI data, and the result showed that the denoised DWI-MRI data obtained using the proposed method can substantially improve the quality of IVIM parametric images.",The therapeutic effect of stiripentol in Gabrg2+/Q390X mice associated with epileptic encephalopathy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022638,Epilepsy research,2019 06 07,"Anti-seizure drugs (ASDs) are widely used and known to increase inhibitory tone on neuro-circuits and reduce aberrant synchronous firing in epilepsy. Some ASDs act as agonist at the GABAA receptor. Stiripentol, known to increase GABAA receptor activity as well as the metabolites of GABAA receptor agonists, is often used in the treatment of an epileptic encephalopathy, Dravet syndrome (DS), which is caused by mutations mainly in SCN1A and in other genes such as GABRG2. We have recently generated a Gabrg2+/Q390X knockin mouse model associated with DS in humans. The objective of the study was to explore the effects of stiripentol in DS with GABAA receptor functional deficiency because of the etiology heterogeneity in DS. Monotherapy (stiripentol or Diazepam) and polytherapy (stiripentol and diazepam) treatments were tested in Gabrg2+/Q390X mice challenged with pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) seizure induction in conjunction with video-monitoring synchronized electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings. A combination of stiripentol and diazepam greatly reduced seizure-related events in Gabrg2+/Q390X mice following PTZ administration and increased survival. However, the treatment of stiripentol alone was mostly ineffective in alleviating seizure-related events except that it reduced mortality in PTZ challenged Gabrg2+/Q390X mice. The study suggests that stiripentol could be only used as add-on therapy for DS with GABAA receptor functional deficiency, which is consistent with the most established clinical application of stiripentol. The study highlights the importance of mechanism-based precision treatment for DS considering the highly heterogeneous nature of etiology in DS and the fact that mutations in different genes give rise to the same clinical phenotype.",Dexamethasone ameliorates the damage of hippocampal filamentous actin cytoskeleton but is not sufficient to cease epileptogenesis in pilocarpine induced epileptic mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022637,Epilepsy research,2019 06 07,"Rogressive deconstruction of filament actin (F-actin) in hippocampal neurons in the epileptic brain have been associated with epileptogenesis. Previous clinical studies suggest that glucocorticoids treatment plays beneficial roles in refractory epilepsy. Glucocorticoids treatment affects dendritic spine morphology by regulating local glucocorticoid receptors and F-actin cytoskeleton dynamics. However, how glucocorticoids regulate epileptogenesis by controlling F-actin cytoskeleton is not clear yet. Here we study the function of glucocorticoids in epileptogenesis by examining F-actin abundance, hippocampal neuron number, and synaptic markers in pilocarpine-induced epileptic mice in the presence or absence of dexamethasone (DEX) treatment. We found that spontaneous seizure duration was significantly reduced; F-actin damage in hippocampal subfields was remarkably attenuated; loss of pyramidal cells was dramatically decreased; more intact synaptic structures indicated by pre- and postsynaptic markers were preserved in multiple hippocampal regions after DEX treatment. However, the number of ZNT3 positive particles in the molecular layer in the hippocampus of pilocarpine epileptic mice was not altered after DEX treatment. Although not sufficient to cease epileptogenesis, our results suggest that dexamethasone treatment ameliorates the damage of epileptic brain by stabilizing F-actin cytoskeleton in the pilocarpine epileptic mice.",Expression of plasma microRNA-145-5p and its correlation with clinical features in patients with refractory epilepsy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022636,Epilepsy research,2019 06 07,"The potential of microRNAs (miRNAs) as biomarkers has been explored in various brain diseases, including epilepsy.

This study examined rhotic vowel development, including accuracy and error patterns, in young children across age, diagnostic groups, and phonetic contexts. Participants included 34 children from 2 to 6 years of age with and without speech sound disorders (SSD). Data included 36 elicited single words containing stressed and unstressed rhotic monophthongs ([ɜ˞] and [ə˞]) and four rhotic diphthongs (/ɪ͡ə˞/, /ε͡ə˞/, /ɔ͡ə˞/, and /ɑ͡ə˞/). Additional words containing non-rhotic vowels and the consonant /ɹ/ were also included for comparison. A significant difference in rhotic vowel production accuracy was found between diagnostic groups (with vs. without SSD), but not across age groups or phonetic contexts. Yet, the accuracy scores for children without SSD were bimodally distributed, showing overlapping patterns with children with SSD. Error patterns were examined for all children with low rhotic vowel accuracy scores, regardless of age and diagnostic status. Results of this study highlight the variability in rhotic vowel development in young children and the importance of studying rhotic sounds using overall rhotic sound accuracy of each individual child regardless of their age or diagnostic status. Clinically, systematic within-speaker error patterns suggest the need for the detailed error pattern assessment of rhotic sounds.",Colorimetric and naked eye detection of trace Hg2+ ions in the environmental water samples based on plasmonic response of sodium alginate impregnated by silver nanoparticles.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022633,Journal of hazardous materials,2019 05 20,"Water pollution with mercury is a global concern. Therefore, establishing a rapid and accurate detection method is urgently required. Nanosensors can be a perfect alternative to instrument detection. In order to overcome low sustainability of sensors, a new composite nanosensor of sodium alginate- silver nanoparticles (SA-AgNPs) was synthesized by solvent casting method and used in colorimetric and naked eye detection of trace Hg2+ ions in water samples. The structural features of the produced nanosensor were characterized by instrumental techniques. The obtained results confirmed the formation of AgNPs with an average size of 13.34 nm. The colorimetric sensing of Hg2+ was carried out under specific conditions (pH = 6 and reaction time of 7 min) with a linear correlation obtained between the absorbance at 402 nm and different Hg2+ ion concentrations within the range of 0.025 μM-60 μM. The synthesized composite nanosensor of SA-AgNPs detected Hg2+ ions with a detection limit (LOD) of 5.29 nM. In addition, this sensor was successfully applied to detect Hg2+ ions in the environmental water samples with recoveries within the range of 81.58% to 114.73%. The produced nanosensor exhibited good selectivity toward Hg2+ ions in the presence of several competing ions.",Highly pure MgO2 nanoparticles as robust solid oxidant for enhanced Fenton-like degradation of organic contaminants.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022632,Journal of hazardous materials,2019 05 20,"In typical Fenton/Fenton-like reactions, H2O2 was usually used as an oxidant to degrade organic contaminants. However, liquid H2O2 is unstable, easy to decompose and has high biological toxicity especially at high concentration. Herein, highly pure magnesium peroxide (MgO2) nanoparticles were first synthesized and used instead of H2O2 to degrade organic dyes. The structure and morphology of as-prepared products were confirmed by XRD, SEM, TEM and FTIR techniques. The active oxygen content of MgO2 nanoparticles reached up to 26.93 wt%, suggesting a high purity of the as-prepared sample. The degradation performance of MgO2 nanoparticles towards organic contaminants was systematically investigated in the terms of the molar ratio of Fe3+ to MgO2, the dosage of MgO2, initial solution pH and different organic dyes. The results indicated the as-prepared MgO2 exhibited excellent degradation ability to various types of organic dyes. 10 mg of MgO2 nanoparticles could almost completely degrade 200 mL of 20 mg/L methylene blue (MB) in 30 min with a TOC removal rate of 70.2%. The efficient degradation performance was ascribed to the generation of hydroxyl radicals in the MgO2/Fe3+ system. The pathways of MB degradation were also proposed based on the determination of the reaction intermediates."

The purpose of this study was to investigate the potential of nanoscale zerovalent iron (nZVI), nanoscale zerovalent iron supported by biochar (nZVI@BC), ferrous sulfide (FeS-NPs), ferrous sulfide supported by biochar (FeS-NPs@BC), ferriferrous oxide (Fe3O4-NPs) and ferriferrous oxide supported by biochar (Fe3O4-NPs@BC) to remediate Pb contaminated soil and the influences for soil micro-ecology. The results showed that biochar (BC) could improve the crystal shape and superficial area of iron-based nanoparticles. Soil pH values was significantly decreased by FeS-NPs and FeS-NPs@BC, but increased by other iron-nanoparticles. The ability to reduce available Pb concentration showed significant difference among these iron-nanoparticles, that is, the immobilized rate were nZVI by 45.80%, nZVI@BC by 54.68%, FeS-NPs by 2.70%, FeS-NPs@BC by 5.13%, Fe3O4-NPs by 47.47%, Fe3O4-NPs@BC by 30.51% at day 90. Almost all soil enzyme activities in Fe3O4-NPs and Fe3O4-NPs@BC groups were increased, but the majority of the enzyme activities were inhibited in other iron-based nanoparticles groups, while the maximum bacterial number was determined in FeS-NPs group. Furthermore, microbial diversity analysis showed that FeS-NPs has significantly changed microbial community richness and diversity, followed by nZVI and Fe3O4-NPs. Accordingly, our results suggested that nZVI@BC had the best immobilization effect on Pb in high-concentration Pb-contaminated alkaline soil, but the toxic effect of Fe3O4-NPs on soil micro-ecology was relatively minimal.",Development of correlation spectroscopy (COS) method for analyzing fluorescence excitation emission matrix (EEM): A case study of effluent organic matter (EfOM) ozonation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022618,Chemosphere,2019 05 27,"Two-dimensional correlation spectroscopy (2DCOS) has been used as a powerful tool for analyzing spectral features, but it has never been applied to fluorescence excitation-emission matrix (EEM) data due to the incompatible dimensions. This study first investigated EEM-COS by reducing the dimensions of the EEM (using parallel factor analysis, PARAFAC) for fitting to 2DCOS (EEM-PARAFAC-COS). The fluorescence changes of effluent organic matter (EfOM) during ozonation were studied using EEM-COS and synchronous fluorescence (SF)-2DCOS. The conventionally used SF-2DCOS proved to be biased due to the intrinsic drawback of SF, while the EEM-PARAFAC-COS gave accurate and trustworthy results. Homo-EEM-PARAFAC-COS indicated that the fluorescence protein-like and fulvic-like substances in EfOM were preferentially ozonated compared to humic-like substances. Hetero-EEM-PARAFAC-COS analyses on the EEM, FTIR, UV-vis absorbance, and size-exclusion chromatography showed that the fluorescence protein-like and fulvic-like substances in EfOM were associated with lower molecular weight (MW, ∼0.95 kDa), UV absorbance at ∼280 nm, and more electron-enriched aromatics (with amide and phenolic groups), which explained their ozonation preference, while humic-like substances were related to carboxylic groups, UV absorbance at ∼255 nm, and organics at MW of ∼4.50 kDa. This work demonstrated the great potential of EEM-PARAFAC-COS in studying fluorescence change and correlating fluorescence with other spectra.",Carbon dioxide as a carrier gas and biomass addition decrease the total and bioavailable polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in biochar produced from sewage sludge.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022617,Chemosphere,2019 05 27,"Organic-solvent extractable (Ctot) and freely dissolved (Cfree) polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) (US EPA 16 PAHs) were determined in biochars produced from the mixture of sewage sludge and sewage sludge and willow (8:2 or 6:4, w/w). The pyrolysis was carried out at 500, 600, and 700 °C using two different carrier gases (N2 or CO2). Addition of willow and the change of carrier gas from N2 to CO2 reduced Ctot PAHs (from 7.0 to 52%) and Cfree PAHs (15-29%) content. Co-application of willow and SSL and the use of CO2 as a carrier gas also beneficially affected the PAHs profile. The biochars produced with willow addition and/or in a CO2 atmosphere were characterized by a lower (from 9.0 to 62.8%) percentage of 3-6-ring PAHs (Ctot) than the biochars derived from sewage sludge alone in N2 atmosphere. The contribution of individual Cfree PAHs did not differ significantly between biochars. The presence of willow during pyrolysis influenced the direction of the changes in the Ctot PAH content depending on the pyrolysis temperature. For SSL alone, regardless of the carrier gas used, the content of Ctot PAHs was observed to decrease with increasing temperature, whereas in the presence of willow temperature did not affect significantly (P ≥ 0.05) the Ctot PAHs content. The change of carrier gas from N2 to CO2 increased the affinity of the biochars to PAHs as confirmed by the distribution coefficients log KTOC.","Solidification of sand by Pb(II)-tolerant bacteria for capping mine waste to control metallic dust: Case of the abandoned Kabwe Mine, Zambia.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022616,Chemosphere,2019 05 27,"Environmental impacts resulting from historic lead and zinc mining in Kabwe, Zambia affect human health due to the dust generated from the mine waste that contains lead, a known hazardous pollutant. We employed microbially induced calcium carbonate precipitation (MICP), an alternative capping method, to prevent dust generation and reduce the mobility of contaminants. Pb-resistant Oceanobacillus profundus KBZ 1-3 and O. profundus KBZ 2-5 isolated from Kabwe were used to biocement the sand that would act as a cover to prevent dust and water infiltration. Sand biocemented by KBZ 1-3 and KBZ 2-5 had maximum unconfined compressive strength values of 3.2 MPa and 5.5 MPa, respectively. Additionally, biocemented sand exhibited reduced water permeability values of 9.6 × 10-8 m/s and 8.9 × 10-8 m/s for O. profundus KBZ 1-3 and KBZ 2-5, respectively, which could potentially limit the entrance of water and oxygen into the dump, hence reducing the leaching of heavy metals. We propose that these isolates represent an option for bioremediating contaminated waste by preventing both metallic dust from becoming airborne and rainwater from infiltrating into the waste. O. profundus KBZ 1-3 and O. profundus KBZ 2-5 isolated form Kabwe represent a novel species that has, for the first time, been applied in a bioremediation study.",Salting out assisted liquid-liquid extraction for liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry determination of amphetamine-like stimulants in meconium.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022615,Journal of pharmaceutical and biomedical analysis,2019 06 04,"In the last decade there has been a dramatic increase in the availability and abuse of synthetic cathinones - new amphetamine-like stimulants. Even though their abuse during pregnancy could have serious adverse effects on the fetus, cathinones are not readily included in neonatal toxicological screenings. Meconium (first neonatal stool) is the specimen of choice to reveal long term drug exposure, however as it is a highly complex matrix, the sample preparation is a critical step before the instrumental analysis. The aim of this work was to develop a suitable meconium sample extraction technique using the advantages of salting-out assisted liquid-liquid extraction (SALLE) and using only MS-friendly organic ammonium salts. We further developed and validated liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry method for the determination of 'traditional' stimulants (methamphetamine, amphetamine, MDMA) and cathinones (mephedrone, methylenedioxypyrovalerone (MDPV), α-pyrrolidinopentiophenone (α-PVP), methylone, butylone, flephedrone, and naphyrone). Matrix-matched calibration was prepared in the concentration range 10-2000 ng/g. The limits of quantification were determined as 10 ng/g, recoveries ranged from 48.2% to 94.3% and the matrix effect was between 60.2% and 101.4%. Accuracy (86.1-114.5%) and precision (4.9-14.9%) were determined and all validation criteria were met for all analytes except for naphyrone. Finally, our analytical method was tested on a set of real meconium samples, which were found positive for amphetamine, methamphetamine and methylone, thus demonstrating the validity of the method.",Development and validation of a highly sensitive LC-MS/MS method for in vitro measurement of histamine concentration.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022614,Journal of pharmaceutical and biomedical analysis,2019 06 04,"The basophil histamine release test (HRT) is an important in vitro diagnostic assay to evaluate immunoglobin E (IgE)-mediated allergic responses. In this study, a bioanalytical LC-MS/MS method was developed and validated to quantify histamine in the leukocyte suspension from human peripheral blood. The method used pre-column derivatization with phenylisothiocyanate (PITC) and the resulting phenylthiocarbamyl (PTC) histamine was analyzed by positive-ion electrospray ionization using the multiple reaction monitoring mode. Chromatographic separation was achieved using an Imtakt-HT C18 column (2.1 mm × 50 mm, 3.0 μm), with a flow rate of 0.35 mL/min, 2 μL injection, and gradient elution with a mixture of acetonitrile-2 mM ammonium acetate buffer (both containing 0.1% formic acid). The total runtime of the method was 3.0 min including equilibration time. The method had a lower limit of detection of 0.1 ng/mL, and the quantifiable range was 0.1-100 ng/mL in the leukocyte suspension. The intra-day and inter-day precision and accuracy results were within the acceptable limits. It was established that histamine quantification should be performed within 2 h of preparing the leukocyte suspension, and freezing and thawing should be avoided. This method was successfully applied to the diagnosis and evaluation of the pathophysiologic mechanism of respiratory or cutaneous allergic diseases.","Quantitation of paclitaxel, and its 6-alpha-OH and 3-para-OH metabolites in human plasma by LC-MS/MS.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022613,Journal of pharmaceutical and biomedical analysis,2019 06 10,"We have developed a high performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry method for quantitating paclitaxel and its 6-alpha-OH and 3-para-OH metabolites in 0.1 mL human plasma.

Mass spectrometric detection was performed on an ABI SCIEX 4000Q with electrospray, positive-mode ionization. The assay was linear from 10-10,000 ng/mL for paclitaxel and 1-1000 ng/mL for both metabolites and proved to be accurate (94.3-110.4%) and precise (<11.3%CV). Recovery from plasma was 59.3-91.3% and matrix effect was negligible (-3.5 to 6.2%). Plasma freeze thaw stability (90.2-107.0%), stability for 37 months at -80 °C (89.4-112.6%), and stability for 4 h at room temperature (87.7-100.0%) were all acceptable. This assay will be an essential tool to further define the metabolism and pharmacology of paclitaxel and metabolites in the clinical setting.

To determine the developmental toxicity and thyroid-disrupting effect of NPs, the effects of exposure to nonylphenol (NP), 4-nonylphenol (4-NP), and nonylphenol ethoxylate (NP-12) were examined according to the frog embryo teratogenesis assay-Xenopus (FETAX) and Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development test guidelines 231 (TG231). In FETAX, the LC50 values of NP, 4-NP, and NP-12 were 59.14 mg/L, 10.13 mg/L, and 14.60 mg/L, respectively. At 10.0 mg/L, NP, 4-NP, and NP-12 significantly decreased the total length of tadpoles, and NP and 4-NP increased gut malformation and bent tails. In surviving tadpoles, the EC50 values for malformation of NP, 4-NP, and NP-12 were 4.66, 6.51, and 13.08 mg/L, respectively.

NP and NP-12 at test concentrations did not alter the larval stage, but NP-12 at 0.37 mg/L significantly decreased total length and tail length, suggesting growth inhibition in larvae. The total colloid area of thyroid follicles was significantly increased by 0.07 mg/L 4-NP but not by NP and NP-12, suggesting that 4-NP may interfere with thyroid function. Together, the developmental toxicity of NPs was in the following order: 4-NP, NP-12, and NP. 4-NP may alter metamorphosis driven by thyroid hormones in X. laevis.",The role of nuclear receptors in the differentiation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells derived from fetal and adult neural stem cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022610,Stem cell research,2019 06 02,"Oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) differentiation from multipotent neural stem cells (NSCs) into mature oligodendrocytes is driven by thyroid hormone and mediated by thyroid hormone receptors (TRs). We show that several nuclear receptors display strong changes in expression levels between fetal and adult NSCs, with an overexpression of TRβ and a lower expression of RXRγ in adult. Such changes may determine the reduced capacity of adult OPCs to differentiate as supported by reduced yield of maturation and compromised mRNA expression of key genes. RXRγ may be the determinant of these differences, on the evidence of reduced number of mature oligodendrocytes and increased number of proliferating OPCs in RXRγ-/- cultures. Such data also points to RXRγ as an important regulator of the cell cycle exit, as proved by the dysregulation of T3-induced cell cycle exit-related genes. Our data highlight the biological differences between fetal and adult OPCs and demonstrate the essential role of RXRγ in the T3-mediated OPCs maturation process."

Therefore, the study of comorbidities is particularly urgent. Chaihu-Shugan-San (CSS), a classical traditional Chinese medicine formula, has been used to treat CHD with depression for hundreds of years. However, the mechanism of its action on comorbidities remains unclear. Here, we focused on the behavioral changes in ApoE-/- mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) and elucidated the mechanism of CSS and its main absorbed component, meranzin hydrate (MH), as an anti-atherosclerosis and anti-depression agent. In the present study, mice were fed an HFD for 16 weeks and were intragastrically administered high and low doses of CSS and MH. Depressive-like behaviors were evaluated by the sucrose preference test, the open-field test, the light-dark test and the tail-suspension test, after which atherosclerotic plaques, plasma lipids, inflammatory cytokine levels and the expression of BDNF/TrkB were measured. We demonstrated that the atherosclerosis model group exhibited significant depressant behaviors. Moreover, CSS inhibited depressive-like behavioral changes, reduced atherosclerotic plaque areas, plasma total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL-cholesterol levels and inflammatory cytokines including TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 in plasma and hippocampi, increased the protein and mRNA expression of BDNF and TrkB in the aorta and the hippocampus. Interestingly, MH, the main component in CSS that is absorbed in the plasma and hippocampus, exerted effects similar to those of CSS. In addition, MH increased the protein and mRNA expression of BDNF and TrkB in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) induced by LPS. Collectively, these results suggest that MH represents the CSS decoction, induces anti-atherosclerosis effects and improves depression-like behaviors in HFD-fed ApoE-/- mice. Moreover, the regulation of proinflammatory factors and BDNF-TrkB signaling are possibly involved in this process. Our findings indicate that MH is a potential phytochemical compound for the prevention of the comorbidity of atherosclerosis and depression.","Protective effect of pig brain polypeptides against corticosterone-induced oxidative stress, inflammatory response, and apoptosis in PC12 cells.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022597,Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,2019 06 12,"Pig brain polypeptides (PBP), active polypeptides hydrolysate extracted from fresh porcine brain tissue, has been shown to have neuroprotective effects in both in vitro and in vivo studies.

Here, an effective fabrication method of enhanced micro-scale wrinkles based on oil-pretreated hyperelastic substrates (PDMS and Ecoflex) is proposed for the application of microelectrode biosensors. Compared to pre-stretching or compressing methods, this approach has better advantages including compatibility with MEMS processes on wafer and easy replication. Wrinkled gold microelectrodes exhibit superior electrochemical properties than the flat one, and no crack or delamination occurs after electroplating PEDOT:PSS and platinum black on wrinkled microelectrodes. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) scanning for 2500 times is performed to investigate adhesion and stability of modified materials. For the modified microelectrodes, no significant change is observed in charge storage capacity (CSC) and impedance at 1 kHz, whereas PEDOT:PSS coated flat microelectrodes appears delamination. Ultrasonication and cycling forces are also conducted on modified microelectrodes, which demonstrates little influence on the wrinkled ones. Flexible wrinkled microelectrodes are further verified by in-vivo ECoG recordings combined with optogenetics in mice. These results highlight the importance of micro-structure in neural electrode design and tremendous application potentials in flexible electronics.",Ultrabright fluorescent microsphere and its novel application for improving the sensitivity of immunochromatographic assay.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022594,Biosensors & bioelectronics,2019 05 11,"Fluorescent microsphere (FM) is widely used as probe in immunochromatographic assay (ICA). However, the performance of conventional FM is limited because of the aggregation-caused quenching effect. Herein, we compared a kind of conventional FM (DMFFM, loading DMF) with novel aggregation-induced emission FM (AIEFM, loading TCBPE). The fluorescence intensity of DMFFM initially increased and then decreased as the concentrations of the loading DMF increased. The fluorescence intensity of AIEFM increased as the concentrations of the loading TCBPE increased and retained a high value. AIEFM was compared with two commercial FMs purchased from Ocean (OFM) and Merk (MFM). The maximum fluorescence intensity and relative quantum yield of AIEFM was approximately 5 and 4.5 times higher than those of two commercial FMs. We used the novel AIEFM as a probe to improve the sensitivity of ICA. When Escherichia coli O157:H7 was detected as the target, the limit of detection of ICA based on AIEFM, OFM and MFM were 3.98 × 103 CFU/mL, 4.48 × 104 and 2.78 × 104 CFU/mL, respectively. The ICA of AIEFM had 11 and 7 times improvement in sensitivity compared with that of OFM and MFM.

Results from an active duty military sample.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022593,Behaviour research and therapy,2019 05 27,"The efficacy of prolonged exposure (PE) on suicide ideation (SI) as a secondary outcome among individuals with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is unclear. The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy of PE in two formats (spaced, S-PE, 10 sessions over 8 weeks, and massed, M-PE, 10 sessions over 2 weeks) to Present Centered Therapy (PCT) and minimal contact control (MCC) on SI exacerbation among patients without suicide intent or plans. Active duty military personnel (n = 335) were randomized to: (1) S-PE vs. PCT and (2) M-PE vs. MCC. All participants completed the Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation and the Beck Depression Inventory (Suicide item) at baseline, posttreatment, and follow-ups. S-PE and PCT had significant and comparable reductions in SI during treatment. M-PE had significantly steeper reductions in SI during treatment compared to MCC. Specifically, more participants in M-PE compared to MCC had reliable improvement versus reliable exacerbation. Reduction in PTSD symptoms was significantly associated with reduction of SI. PE was associated with significant reductions in SI over time that were comparable to PCT and superior to MCC. These findings suggest that both trauma- and non-trauma-focused treatments are associated with reductions in SI, and that trauma-focused treatments improve SI relative to waitlist.",Robust optic disc and cup segmentation with deep learning for glaucoma detection.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022592,Computerized medical imaging and graphics : the official journal of the Computerized Medical Imaging Society,2019 05 29,"Glaucoma is rated as the leading cause of irreversible vision loss worldwide. Early detection of glaucoma is important for providing timely treatment and minimizing the vision loss. In this paper, we developed a robust segmentation method for optic disc and cup segmentation using a modified U-Net architecture, which combines the widely adopted pre-trained ResNet-34 model as encoding layers with classical U-Net decoding layers. The model was trained on the newly available RIGA dataset, and achieved an average dice value of 97.31% for disc segmentation and 87.61% for cup segmentation, comparable to that of the experts' performance for optic disc/cup segmentation and Cup-Disc-Ratio (CDR) calculation on a reserved RIGA dataset. When tested on DRISHTI-GS and RIM-ONE dataset without re-training or fine-tuning, the model achieved comparable performance to that of the state-of-the-art in literature. We have also fine-tuned the model on two databases, which achieves an average disc dice value of 97.38% and cup dice value of 88.77% for DRISHTI-GS test set, disc dice of 96.10% and cup dice of 84.45% for RIM-ONE database, which is the state-of-the-art performance on both databases in terms of cup dice and disc dice value. The advantage of the proposed method is the combination of the pre-trained ResNet and U-Net, which avoids training the network from scratch, thereby enabling fast network training with less epochs, thus further avoids over-fitting and achieves robust performance.",Brainstem biopsy in pediatric diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma in the era of precision medicine: the INFORM study experience.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022591,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",2019 06 03,Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) is a highly aggressive paediatric brain tumour with fatal outcome.

These layers (e.g., fabrics, films, membranes, and meshes) can be produced by various continuous and non-continuous processes such as coating, laminating, film stretching, casting, etc. The most common methods for production, characterization, and testing of WPBLs are presented and discussed in light of recent publications. The materials with high level of waterproofness and breathability are often used in outerwear for winter sports, sailing apparel, raincoats, military/police jackets, backpacks, tents, cargo raps, footwear and etc. WPBLs can also be used for other specialized applications such as membrane distillation, oil-water filtration, and wound dressing. These applications are discussed by presenting several good examples. The main challenge in the production of these layers is to compromise between waterproofness and breathability with opposing nature. The related research gaps, challenges, and future outlook are highlighted to shed more light on the topic.","Elasticity, plasticity and analytical machinability prediction of lithium metasilicate/disilicate glass ceramics.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022589,Journal of the mechanical behavior of biomedical materials,2019 06 07,"This paper applied non-linear theory of elasticity (NLTE) to partition indentation-induced deformations into elasticity and plasticity for lithium metasilicate glass ceramic (LMGC), sintered and pressed lithium disilicate glass ceramics (SLDGC and PLDGC). It also used elastic plastic fracture mechanics (EPFM) approach to analytically predict machinability for these materials. Using the Sakai's series elastic and plastic deformation model that applied NLTE, the resistances to plasticity for LMGC, SLDGC and PLDGC were extracted from their respective indentation-extracted plane strain moduli and contact hardness values. Plane strain moduli and resistances to plasticity were used to calculate elasticity and plasticity for these materials. Furthermore, the EPFM approach in the Sakai-Nowak model was applied to deconvolute resistances to machining-induced cracking for these materials. All properties were extracted at 10 mN peak load and 0.1-2 mN/s loading rates to determine the loading-rate influence on these properties. The resistances to plasticity of LMGC and SLDGC were loading rate dependent (ANOVA, p < 0.05) and the resistance to plasticity of PLDGC was loading rate independent (ANOVA, p > 0.05). The strain rate sensitivity model was used to find the intrinsic resistances to plasticity for LMGC and SLDGC. The elastic displacement/deformation components were dominant for LMGC at all loading rates. For SLDGC and PLDGC, the deformation mechanisms were dynamic with the plastic and elastic deformation components dominating at low loading and high loading rates respectively, a phenomenon attributed to indentation energies. The decrease in plastic displacements for all materials with increase in loading rate was due to the strain hardening behaviour. Also, PLDGC revealed the highest absorbed energy followed by SLDGC and LMGC. Finally, PLDGC had the highest resistance to machining-induced cracking followed by SLDGC and LMGC. This study provides a quantitative basis to rank materials in terms of brittleness, ductility and resistance to mechanically-induced cracking."

The result showed the concentration of dissolved oxygen (DO) in the reactor could be accurately controlled by adjusting the reflux ratio of oxygenated water. The higher aeration efficiency in pollutant removal could be obtained by the reoxygenation mode of the small height falling water. At the reflux ratio of 5:1, the ammonium, nitrite and nitrate nitrogen concentrations in the effluent of UMSR were 6.0, 0.4 and 6.1 mg/L on average, respectively.

Although it is widely accepted that the key characteristic of the immune response in jawed vertebrates is the functional cooperation between different immune effector cell lineages, whether immune cells of lamprey can communicate with each other is still unclear. Recently, mounting evidence has revealed the emerging role of exosomes in mediating intercellular communication. In this study, by means of ultrafiltration followed by size exclusion chromatography, exosomes are purified from conditioned growth medium of the primary supraneural myeloid body cells (SMB cells) in LPS-immunized and control Lampetra japonica (Japanese lamprey). The proteomic profiling and qualitative comparison are performed between protein components enriched in exosomes released by SMB cells under quiescent and activated conditions. Our results demonstrate that SMB cells can release exosomes with well-defined characteristics comparable to their mammalian counterparts on their size, morphology and protein markers, which supports exosomes are evolutionarily conserved between lamprey and other higher vertebrate species. In terms of comparison with exosomes released by quiescent SMB cells, activated SMB cell-derived exosomes contain more and significantly different protein components. The unique exosomal protein 'fingerprint' might reflect that exosomes from the SMB cells with different states of activation have distinguishing functional roles as well as targeting properties. Further bioinformatic analysis suggests that compared to quiescent exosomes, activated SMB cell-derived exosomes mainly participate in distinctive biological processes including activation of cellular component biogenesis and regulation of cell proliferation. Moreover, activated exosomes may function through the specific signaling pathways associated with the regulation of cell mitosis and immune response. Our results give valuable clues about the immunomodulatory functions of SMB cell-derived exosomes and provide the foundation for further investigation in the regulation mechanism of the adaptive immune response in lamprey.",Coming 'Home': Place bonding for parents accessing or considering hospice based respite.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022571,Health & place,2019 06 04,"Little literature examines the cognitive journey taken by parents considering/receiving hospice care for their child. A constructivist grounded theory study explored 38 parents' views of considering/using a children's hospice. Data analysed from focus groups and interviews identified three main concepts. The focus of this paper is identified as Coming 'Home'. This concept depicts the desire and the sense of searching that parents experienced in trying to find a place, other than their actual home, where their child could access a caring environment and their parents received some respite from caregiving. Despite there being a paradox associated with hospice-based respite, once they had crossed the threshold the parents bonded with the place and experienced rootedness and familiarity. The hospice became a place of living and belonging; a place where they could 'come home'.",Characterising GPCR-ligand interactions using a fragment molecular orbital-based approach.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022570,Current opinion in structural biology,2019 06 11,"There has been fantastic progress in solving GPCR crystal structures. However, the ability of X-ray crystallography to guide the drug discovery process for GPCR targets is limited by the availability of accurate tools to explore receptor-ligand interactions. Visual inspection and molecular mechanics approaches cannot explain the full complexity of molecular interactions. Quantum mechanical approaches (QM) are often too computationally expensive, but the fragment molecular orbital (FMO) method offers an excellent solution that combines accuracy, speed and the ability to reveal key interactions that would otherwise be hard to detect. Integration of GPCR crystallography or homology modelling with FMO reveals atomistic details of the individual contributions of each residue and water molecule towards ligand binding, including an analysis of their chemical nature.",Dynamic origin of spike and wave discharges in the brain.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022569,NeuroImage,2019 05 27,"Spike and wave discharges are the main electrographic characteristic of a number of epileptic brain disorders including childhood absence epilepsy and photosensitive epilepsy. The basic dynamic mechanism that underlies the occurrence of these abnormal electrical patterns in the brain is not well understood. The current paper aims to provide a dynamic explanation for features and generation mechanism of spike and wave discharges in the brain. The main proposition of this study is that epileptic seizures could be interpreted as a resonance phenomenon rather than a limit cycle behavior. To shows this, a revised version of Jansen-Rit neural mass model is employed. The system can switch between monostable and bistable regimes, which are considered in this paper as wake and sleep states of the brain, respectively. In particular, it is shown that, in monostable region, the model can depict the alpha rhythm and alpha rhythm suppression due to mental activity. Frequency responses of the model near the bistable regime demonstrate that high amplitude harmonic excitation may lead to spike and wave like oscillations. Based on the computational results and the concept of stochastic resonance, a model for absence epilepsy is presented which can simulate spontaneous transitions between ictal and interictal states. Finally, it is shown that spike and wave discharges during epileptic seizures can be explained as a resonance phenomenon in a nonlinear system.",Investigating the impact of autocorrelation on time-varying connectivity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022568,NeuroImage,2019 06 10,"In recent years, a number of studies have reported on the existence of time-varying functional connectivity (TVC) in resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) data. The sliding-window technique is currently one of the most commonly used methods to estimate TVC. Although previous studies have shown that autocorrelation can negatively impact estimates of static functional connectivity, its impact on TVC estimates is not well known at this time. In this paper, we show both theoretically and empirically that the existence of autocorrelation within a time series can inflate the sampling variability of TVC estimated using the sliding-window technique. This can in turn increase the risk of misinterpreting noise as true TVC and negatively impact subsequent estimation of whole-brain time-varying FC profiles, or ""brain states"". The latter holds as more variable input measures lead to more variable output measures in the state estimation procedure. Finally, we demonstrate that prewhitening the data prior to analysis can lower the variance of the estimated TVC and improve brain state estimation. These results suggest that careful consideration is required when making inferences on TVC.",Detection of neural connections with ex vivo MRI using a ferritin-encoding trans-synaptic virus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022567,NeuroImage,2019 05 27,"The elucidation of neural networks is essential to understanding the mechanisms of brain functions and brain disorders. Neurotropic virus-based trans-synaptic tracing tools have become an effective method for dissecting the structure and analyzing the function of neural-circuitry. However, these tracing systems rely on fluorescent signals, making it hard to visualize the panorama of the labeled networks in mammalian brain in vivo. One MRI method, Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI), is capable of imaging the networks of the whole brain in live animals but without information of anatomical connections through synapses. In this report, a chimeric gene coding for ferritin and enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) was integrated into Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), a neurotropic virus that is able to spread anterogradely in synaptically connected networks. After the animal was injected with the recombinant VSV (rVSV), rVSV-Ferritin-EGFP, into the somatosensory cortex (SC) for four days, the labeled neural-network was visualized in the postmortem whole brain with a T2-weighted MRI sequence. The modified virus transmitted from SC to synaptically connected downstream regions. The results demonstrate that rVSV-Ferritin-EGFP could be used as a bimodal imaging vector for detecting synaptically connected neural-network with both ex vivo MRI and fluorescent imaging.

Gene regulatory mechanisms,2019 05 22,"The eukaryotic genome is organized at varying levels into chromosome territories, transcriptional compartments and topologically associating domains (TADs), which are architectural features largely shared between different cell types and across species. In contrast, within TADs, chromatin loops connect enhancers and their target genes to establish unique transcriptomes that distinguish cells and tissues from each other and underlie development and differentiation. How these tissue-specific and temporal stage-specific long-range contacts are formed and maintained is a fundamental question in biology. The widely expressed Lim domain binding 1 protein, LDB1, plays a critical role in connecting enhancers and genes by forming complexes with cell-type specificity across diverse developmental pathways including neurogenesis, cardiogenesis, retinogenesis and hematopoiesis. Here we review the multiple roles of LDB1 in cell fate determination and in chromatin loop formation, with an emphasis on mammalian systems, to illuminate how LDB1 functions in normal cells and in diseases such as cancer.",The identification of naturally occurring labdane diterpenoid calcaratarin D as a potential anti-inflammatory agent.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022551,European journal of medicinal chemistry,2019 05 11,"In this study we report, for the first time, the synthesis of the natural product calcaratarin D via a stereo- and regio-selective aldol condensation with (S)-β-hydroxy-γ-butyrolactone as key steps. A concise synthetic route (under 10 steps) to a series of structurally related normal-labdane diterpenes was also developed and their anti-inflammatory activities were evaluated in an in vitro model of inflammation. The structure-activity relationships (SARs) pertaining to the labdane scaffold were elucidated and results suggest that an α-alkylidene-β-hydroxy-γ-butyrolactone system is necessary for potent activity in the labdanes. Our studies identified the natural product calcaratarin D (1) as a promising anti-inflammatory agent, which effectively modulates the production of pro-inflammatory mediators (e.g., TNF-α, IL-6, NO) at both transcriptional and translational levels. These inhibitory effects are likely to occur via the suppression of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) activation by reducing the p65 nuclear translocation but not its phosphorylation or protein expression. Calcaratarin D exhibited significantly greater inhibition of NF-κB activation than andrographolide, a well-known NF-κB inhibitor from the labdane family, suggesting that a normal-configuration labdane ring or the absence of hydroxyl groups at C-3 and C-19 positions is favorable for potent NF-κB inhibition. We further investigated the effects of calcaratarin D on the upstream signalling pathways and found that the compound selectively suppressed the LPS-induced activation of PI3K/Akt pathway without affecting much of the MAPK (i.e., ERK, JNK, and p38) activation. These findings demonstrate that calcaratarin D exerts its anti-inflammatory effects via a selective Akt-NF-κB-mediated mechanism and potentially offers a new therapeutic strategy for the management of inflammatory diseases.",Heterodimeric Rifampicin-Tobramycin conjugates break intrinsic resistance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to doxycycline and chloramphenicol in vitro and in a Galleria mellonella in vivo model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022550,European journal of medicinal chemistry,2019 05 11,"Intrinsic resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, defined by chromosomally encoded low outer membrane permeability and constitutively over-expressed efflux pumps, is a major reason why the pathogen is refractory to many antibiotics. Herein, we report that heterodimeric rifampicin-tobramycin conjugates break this intrinsic resistance and sensitize multidrug and extensively drug-resistant P. aeruginosa to doxycycline and chloramphenicol in vitro and in vivo. Tetracyclines and chloramphenicol are model compounds for bacteriostatic effects, but when combined with rifampicin-tobramycin adjuvants, their effects became bactericidal at sub MIC levels. Potentiation of tetracyclines correlates with the SAR of this class of drugs and is consistent with outer membrane permeabilization and efflux pump inhibition. Overall, this strategy finds new uses for old drugs and presents an avenue to expand the therapeutic utility of legacy antibiotics to recalcitrant pathogens such as P. aeruginosa.",Antimicrobial polymer modifications to reduce microbial bioburden on endotracheal tubes and ventilator associated pneumonia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022549,Acta biomaterialia,2019 05 18,"Hospital associated infections (HAIs), infections acquired by patients during care in a hospital, remain a prevalent issue in the healthcare field. These infections often occur with the use of indwelling medical devices, such as endotracheal tubes (ETTs), that can result in ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). When examining the various routes of infection, VAP is associated with the highest incidence, rate of morbidity, and economic burden. Although ETTs are essential for the survival of patients requiring mechanical ventilation, their use comes with complications. The presence of an ETT in the airway impairs physiological host defense mechanisms for clearance of pathogens and provides a platform for oropharynx microorganism transport to the sterile tracheobronchial network. Antibiotics are administered to treat lower respiratory infections; however, they are not always effective and consequently can result in increased antibiotic resistance. Prophylactic approaches by altering the surface of ETTs to prevent the establishment and growth of bacteria have exhibited promising results. In addition, passive surface modifications that prevent bacterial establishment and growth, or active coatings that possess a bactericidal effect have also proven effective. In this review we aim to highlight the importance of preventing biofilm establishment on indwelling medical devices, focusing on ETTs. We will investigate successful antimicrobial modifications to ETTs and the future avenues that will ultimately decrease HAIs and improve patient care. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Infections that occur with indwelling medicals devices remain a constant concern in the medical field and can result in hospital-acquired infections. Specifically, ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) occurs with the use of an endotracheal tube (ETT). Infections often require use of antibiotics and can result in patient mortality. Our review includes a summary of the recent collective work of antimicrobial ETT modifications and potential avenues for further investigations in an effort to reduce VAP associated with ETTs. Polymer modifications with antibacterial nature have been developed and tested; however, a focus on ETTs is lacking and clinical availability of new antimicrobial ETT devices is limited. Our collective work shows the successful and prospective applications to the surfaces of ETTs that can support researchers and physicians to create safer medical devices.","N2 fixation impacted by carbon fixation via dissolved organic carbon in the changing Daya Bay, South China Sea.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022548,The Science of the total environment,2019 05 14,"We present the first concurrent measurements of N2 fixation rates (15N2 uptake), primary production (14C uptake), dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations, and diazotrophic community composition derived from nitrogenase (nifH) abundance in the subtropical Daya Bay (DB) of the coastal northern South China Sea (NSCS) from 2015 to 2017. N2 fixation rates ranged from n.d. - 4.51 nmol N L-1 h-1. Such values were generally higher than those reported in the neighbouring NSCS open waters and several well-studied oligotrophic waters, thereby suggesting that N-replete conditions do not prevent N2 fixation in coastal waters. N2 fixation rates were positively and significantly correlated with the primary production and the concentration of DOC in DB in the spring and summer. Combined with other lines of evidence, we suggest that N2 fixation may be facilitated by non-diazotrophic phytoplankton via a probable regulation of the quantity and quality (bioavailability) of DOC in DB. Since DB represents a suitable site that has experienced dramatic human-induced changes in environmental conditions, our results likely provide insights in understanding how N2 fixation and relevant biogeochemical processes may respond to intensified global anthropogenic forcing in similar coastal settings.",Multi-objective green design model to mitigate environmental impact of construction of mega columns for super-tall buildings.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022547,The Science of the total environment,2019 05 06,"The mega columns used in super-tall buildings are several meters in size; thus, a greater quantity of construction materials are required than for a general column. Considering the environmental impact, research on a green design model for super-tall buildings is necessary. This design model should minimize both CO2 emissions and cost in the mega-column construction and design phases with consideration of the member or building size. In this regard, a multi-objective green design model (MOGDM) capable of minimizing construction cost and reducing CO2 emissions is proposed in this study. The MOGDM is applied to the design of mega columns for a super-tall building and its performance is evaluated based on the average environmental impact reduction rate (AER) and the average increase-in-cost reduction rate (AICR); these indexes are developed to assess the CO2 emission and construction cost reduction capability. Under the loading scenarios considered in this study, the average AER and AICR for the MOGDM output are 6.76% and 58.02%, respectively. Thus, the evaluation results confirm that the MOGDM proposed in this study can effectively reduce CO2 emissions and cost in the design and construction phases of mega columns for super-tall buildings.",Computing payments for wind erosion prevention service incorporating ecosystem services flow and regional disparity in Yanchi County.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022546,The Science of the total environment,2019 05 06,"Simulating the flows of ecosystem services (ESs) can help understand their spatiotemporal flow paths from generation to use, thereby facilitating payments from beneficiaries to providers of ESs. In this study, an analytical framework incorporated with ES flows and regional disparity was established to compute payments for wind erosion prevention service (WEPS). The results showed that between 2010 and 2015, both the potential and actual wind erosion amounts in Yanchi County decreased considerably, and the total amount of sand fixed by WEPS decreased significantly from 3.71 × 109 kg to 0.08 × 109 kg; additionally, the economic value of the WEPS also decreased from CNY 479.46 million to CNY 10.22 million. Based on the spatiotemporal movements of the physical and economic value flows of the WEPS, this study revealed spatiotemporal relationships between areas providing and benefiting from the WEPS of Yanchi County and provided a direct, scientific basis for decision makers to formulate payment systems for WEPS. The total amount paid for WEPS by beneficiaries in China should theoretically be CNY 38.16 million in 2010 and CNY 1.00 million in 2015 based on the economic value flow of WEPS and the regional disparity coefficient. This framework can provide a scientific and objective basis for establishing horizontal ecological compensation policies.",Wild owls colonized by international clones of extended-spectrum β-lactamase (CTX-M)-producing Escherichia coli and Salmonella Infantis in the Southern Cone of America.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022545,The Science of the total environment,2019 05 14,"Extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs)-producing Enterobacteriaceae have been classified as critical priority pathogens by the World Health Organization (WHO). We have conducted a microbiological and genomic surveillance study, in order to investigate the occurrence and features of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in wild birds admitted to a wildlife rescue and rehabilitation centre in Chile. This study reports for the first time the occurrence of highly virulent ESBL-producing Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica serovar Infantis in wild owls inhabiting the Southern Cone of America. Genomic analysis revealed a wide resistome (for antibiotics, heavy metals and disinfectants) among international lineages of E. coli belonging to ST345 and ST2705, and S. Infantis ST32, producing CTX-M-8 or CTX-M-65 ESBLs. On the other hand, wide virulome was associated with a highly virulent behaviour in the Galleria mellonella infection model. Worryingly, all these lineages have been previously reported in humans, supporting that wide resistome and virulome could be contributing to rapid adaptation and dissemination of these clones at the human-animal-environment interface. In summary, wild owls can constitute environmental reservoirs of international clones of ESBL (CTX-M)-producing E. coli and S. Infantis carrying a wide resistome and virulome, in the Southern Cone of America, with potential risks to human, animal and environmental health.","Effect of co-existing Co2+ ions on the aggregation of humic acid in aquatic environment: Aggregation kinetics, dynamic properties and fluorescence spectroscopic study.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022544,The Science of the total environment,2019 05 06,"The fate and transport of humic substances in the aquatic environments depend significantly on their interactions with co-existing ions. Herein, we employed dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurement, molecular dynamic (MD) simulation and fluorescence spectrometry to investigate the aggregation of humic acid (HA) in the presence of Co2+ ions. The aggregation kinetics was depicted by hydrodynamic diameter (<Dh>) and the attachment efficiency (α) of HA aggregates. α increases gradually in the reaction-limited (slow) regime due to the decrease of the double layer repulsion, and the energy barrier is eliminated to a certain extent in the diffusion-limited reaction while α close to unity. The complexation between functional groups (i.e. carboxylic and phenolic groups) of HA and Co2+ ions contributes significantly to the aggregation process of HA. MD simulation and density functional theory (DFT) calculation demonstrate that the aggregation process of HA can be promoted by Co2+ through several inter- or intra-molecular interactions between HA and the Co2+ ions. The results provide a pathway for insight into the interactions between HA and metal ions, which is important for deeply understanding the environmental behaviors of HA in natural aqueous systems.","Control of the mobilization of arsenic and other natural pollutants in groundwater by calcium carbonate concretions in the Pampean Aquifer, southeast of the Buenos Aires province, Argentina.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022543,The Science of the total environment,2019 05 06,"The water supply for human consumption in the Chaco-Pampean region in Argentina is restricted by the low quality of groundwater due to elevated concentrations of arsenic and other trace elements. Previous studies indicated a complex concurrence of factors and processes that are believed responsible to control the distribution of arsenic in groundwater. For a better understanding of the origin of trace elements in the Pampean aquifer, flow-through experiments with loess and calcrete samples representative of the sediments that constitute the aquifer were carried out in continuous flow reactors. The aqueous solutions were collected and the concentrations of SiO2(aq), Ca2+, SO42-, Na+, Cl-, F- and trace elements (Ba, Sr, V, and As) were measured by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and capillary electrophoresis. The experiments showed differences in the release rate of elements to the solution according to the type of sediment. The highest concentrations of V, Ba, and As were measured in experiments conducted with loess, and these elements were released quickly to the solution in the first minute of the test. In the case of loess, V and As are suggested to be adsorbed on the solid particles surface. Conversely, the experiments conducted with calcrete showed a lower but continuous release of those elements. This last result may indicate that the trace elements were coprecipitated in the calcite. In addition, it was demonstrated that F did not come from the dissolution of minerals such as fluorapatite, but both desorption from solid surface and dissolution from calcite minerals account for the release of F. This study support that both dissolution and adsorption-desorption processes can control the mobility of trace elements, with an emphasis on the role of calcrete in the retention and the mobilization of trace elements in the Pampean aquifer."

Further batch experiments with the addition of an AI-2-regulating Escherichia coli mutant culture showed that a reduction in AI-2 levels resulted in the highest biogas production rate during a PCP shock. In contrast, an increase in AI-2 levels via addition of the E. coli wild type strain or an AI-2 precursor showed no obvious effects on biogas production. These results suggest that the AI-2 level in anaerobic sludge was governed primarily by Firmicutes, and the AI-2-mediated QS partially regulates the toxic shock response of anaerobic sludge via tuning the activities of Firmicutes and Synergistetes. A decrease in the AI-2 level might reduce acetogenesis and favor hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis, thus resulting in less VFA accumulation and higher methane production during the PCP shock. This study is the first of this type that exploits the role of quorum sensing in the toxic shock response of anaerobic sludge; it demonstrates a novel approach to shortening the recovery period of anaerobic processes via manipulating the AI-2-mediated QS.",Effective removal of uranium via phosphate addition for the treatment of uranium laden process effluents.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022530,Water research,2019 05 18,"We have investigated the suitability of phosphate addition, in the form MH2PO4 (M = Na+, K+ or NH4+), for the selective removal of uranium from a complex waste effluent. The effluent in question is generated as part of a treatment strategy for a spent uranium catalyst, used in the production of acrylonitrile (Sohio process), which has been in temporary storage in Korea since 2004. Both pH (3.0-11.0) and phosphate dosages (0.25-10 mM) have been screened to identify the optimal conditions of 6.25 and 1 mM, respectively, for an initial uranium concentration of 0.16 mM. Precipitation kinetics have been investigated revealing the rapid removal of uranium from solution, with 30 min found to be optimal. The effluent was effectively decontaminated via Meta-ankoleite (K(UO2)(PO4)·3H2O) formation to uranium levels below the Korean release limit of 1 ppm for uranium-bearing liquid wastes, with KH2PO4 addition being chosen for the real process. Final decontamination factors of the order of ≥ 8000 were readily achieved. Aluminium, calcium and iron containing coagulants were screened for the clean-up of the remaining supernatant, post-uranium removal, ensuring the final effluent meets the relevant release criteria (pH, total suspended solids, total phosphate and turbidity) for general, non-radioactive, effluents. A process scheme is presented and discussed for adaptation to similar uranium containing effluents.",Assessment of sediment and organic carbon exports into the Arctic ocean: The case of the Yenisei River basin.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022529,Water research,2019 05 18,"The export of organic carbon export by the rivers to the oceans either as particulate organic carbon (POC) or dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is very sensitive to climate change especially in permafrost affected catchments where soils are very rich in organic carbon. With global warming, organic carbon export in both forms is expected to increase in Arctic regions. It should affect contemporary biogeochemical cycles in rivers and oceans and therefore modify the whole food web. This study tries to understand complex processes involved in sediment, POC and DOC riverine transport in the Yenisei River basin and to quantify their respective fluxes at the river outlet. The SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) hydrological model is used in this study to simulate water and suspended sediment transfers in the largest Arctic river. POC and DOC export have been quantified with empirical models, adapted from literature for the study case. First, the hydrological model has been calibrated and validated at a daily time step for the 2003-2008 and the 2009-2016 periods respectively, and its output has been compared with field data for water and sediment fluxes. Based on conceptualization of transfer processes, calibration on climate and soil properties has been performed in order to correctly represent hydrology and sediment transfer in permafrost basins. Second, calibration of empirical models for DOC/POC transport have been performed by comparing their output with field data, available from 2003 to 2016. Our study reveals that SWAT is capable of correctly representing hydrology, sediment transfer, POC and DOC fluxes and their spatial distribution at a daily timescale, and outlines the links between these fluxes and permafrost features. Our simulation effort results in specific sediment, POC and DOC fluxes of 2.97 t km-2 yr-1, 0.13 t km-2 yr-1 and 1.14 t km-2 yr-1 for the period 2003-2016 which are in the range of previous estimates. About 60% of the total fluxes of sediment, DOC and POC to the Arctic Ocean are exported during the two months of the freshet. Spatial analysis show that permafrost-free areas have returned higher daily organic carbon export than permafrost affected zones, highlighting the thawing permafrost effect on carbon cycle in climate change feedback.",Genome-resolved metagenomics of an autotrophic thiocyanate-remediating microbial bioreactor consortium.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022528,Water research,2019 05 18,"Industrial thiocyanate (SCN-) waste streams from gold mining and coal coking have polluted environments worldwide. Modern SCN- bioremediation involves use of complex engineered heterotrophic microbiomes; little attention has been given to the ability of a simple environmental autotrophic microbiome to biodegrade SCN-. Here we present results from a bioreactor experiment inoculated with SCN- -loaded mine tailings, incubated autotrophically, and subjected to a range of environmentally relevant conditions. Genome-resolved metagenomics revealed that SCN- hydrolase-encoding, sulphur-oxidizing autotrophic bacteria mediated SCN- degradation. These microbes supported metabolically-dependent non-SCN--degrading sulphur-oxidizing autotrophs and non-sulphur oxidizing heterotrophs, and ""niche"" microbiomes developed spatially (planktonic versus sessile) and temporally (across changing environmental parameters). Bioreactor microbiome structures changed significantly with increasing temperature, shifting from Thiobacilli to a novel SCN- hydrolase-encoding gammaproteobacteria. Transformation of carbonyl sulphide (COS), a key intermediate in global biogeochemical sulphur cycling, was mediated by plasmid-hosted CS2 and COS hydrolase genes associated with Thiobacillus, revealing a potential for horizontal transfer of this function. Our work shows that simple native autotrophic microbiomes from mine tailings can be employed for SCN- bioremediation, thus improving the recycling of ore processing waters and reducing the hydrological footprint of mining.",Vesicle transition of catanionic redox-switchable surfactants controlled by DNA with different chain lengths.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022527,Journal of colloid and interface science,2019 05 20,"Electrostatic self-assembly is used as a facile and convenient method to fabricate soft materials with synergetic novel properties.

In this work, NiS and CoS nanospheres were respectively loaded on BiVO4 thin films (NiS/BiVO4 and CoS/BiVO4 composites) to improve its reaction kinetics for PEC water decomposition. Both physical and chemical properties of these composites were characterized by XRD, SEM, TEM, PL and UV-DRS. The photoelectric properties of the samples were verified by testing LSV, i-t, EIS and IPCE. The formation of the composites can effectively prevent the recombination of carriers and consequently accelerate the separation of electrons and holes. NiS/BiVO4 and CoS/BiVO4 can reach photocurrent of 2.1 mA cm-2 and 2.7 mA cm-2 under light respectively, at 1.23 V vs. RHE, which are 1.75 times and 2.25 times that of BiVO4 (1.2 mA cm-2).

Developing alternative methods for combating bacterial infections is urgently required. In this work, a simple hydrothermal approach was employed to prepare the protoporphyrin IX-polyethylenimine nanoparticles (PPIX-PEI NPs) containing abundant amine groups and PPIX moieties. The as-obtained PPIX-PEI NPs exhibit antibacterial properties against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The presence of PPIX in the PPIX-PEI NPs can generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) under 635 nm laser irradiation, which enhance the antibacterial properties of the PPIX-PEI NPs against Gram-positive bacteria. Thus, the PPIX-PEI NPs display a synergistic antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria in the combination of antibacterial photodynamic therapy (PDT). In addition, emission of red fluorescence by the PPIX-PEI NPs can help to differentiate bacteria and observe the bacterial morphologies using a confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM).",Boosting photocatalytic hydrogen generation of cadmium telluride colloidal quantum dots by nickel ion doping.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022524,Journal of colloid and interface science,2019 05 20,"Splitting water into hydrogen (H2) with sunlight is an appealing approach towards alleviating the fossil fuel crisis. However, as one of the most promising light harvesters, colloidal quantum dots (QDs) generally exhibit low photocatalytic activity towards H2 evolution because of the lack of catalytic sites on their surface. Many researchers have focused on activating QDs by anchoring metal complexes on their surface, in which the photoexcited electrons may transfer from the QDs to the metal centres via the organic ligands. These bulky organic ligands usually have poor electrical conductivity and chemical instability, thereby causing high charge recombination and low durability in these QDs/metal complex catalysts. To address these issues, we herein report the doping of cadmium telluride (CdTe) QDs with nickel ions (Ni2+), achieving a remarkable H2 generation rate without the use of co-catalysts. The formation rate of H2 exceeded 27.3 mmol/g/h under visible light irradiation, which is approximately 110-fold higher than that of pristine CdTe QDs. This doping strategy provides a versatile route to reduce protons to H2 with a turnover number of 13,650 in terms of Ni and confer superior durability on the CdTe QDs.",Natural products in licorice for the therapy of liver diseases: Progress and future opportunities.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022523,Pharmacological research,2019 05 20,"Liver diseases related complications represent a significant source of morbidity and mortality worldwide, creating a substantial economic burden.

Various bioactive components have been isolated and identified from the licorice, including glycyrrhizin, glycyrrhetinic acid, liquiritigenin, Isoliquiritigenin, licochalcone A, and glycycoumarin. Emerging evidence suggested that these natural products relieved liver diseases and prevented DILI through multi-targeting therapeutic mechanisms, including anti-steatosis, anti-oxidative stress, anti-inflammation, immunoregulation, anti-fibrosis, anti-cancer, and drug-drug interactions. In the current review, we summarized the recent progress in the research of hepatoprotective and toxic effects of different licorice-derived bioactive ingredients and also highlighted the potency of these compounds as promising therapeutic options for the treatment of liver diseases and DILI. We also outlined the networks of underlying molecular signaling pathways. Further pharmacology and toxicology research will contribute to the development of natural products in licorice and their derivatives as medicines with alluring prospect in the clinical application.","The interplay between ambient temperature and salt intake affects oxidative status and immune responses in a ubiquitous Neotropical passerine, the rufous-collared sparrow.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022522,"Comparative biochemistry and physiology. Part A, Molecular & integrative physiology",2019 06 08,"Physiological traits associated with maintenance, growth, and reproduction demand a large amount of energy and thus directly influence an animal's energy budget, which is also regulated by environmental conditions. In this study, we evaluated the interplay between ambient temperature and salinity of drinking water on energy budgets and physiological responses in adult Rufous-collared sparrow (Zonotrichia capensis), an omnivorous passerine that is ubiquitous in Chile and inhabits a wide range of environments. We acclimated birds to 30 days at two ambient temperatures (27 °C and 17 °C) and drinking water salinity (200 mM NaCl and fresh water) conditions. We evaluated: 1) the aerobic scope and the activities of mitochondrial metabolic enzymes, 2) osmoregulatory parameters, 3) the skin-swelling immune response to an antigen, 4) oxidative status, and 5) the length of telomeres of red blood cells. Our results confirm that Z. capensis tolerates the chronic consumption of moderate levels of salt, maintaining body mass but increasing their basal metabolic rates consistent with expected osmoregulatory costs. Additionally, the factorial aerobic scope was higher in birds acclimated to fresh (tap) water at both 17° and 27 °C. Drinking water salinity and low ambient temperatures negatively impacted inflammatory response, and we observed an increase in lipid peroxidation and high levels of circulating antioxidants at low temperatures. Finally, telomere length was not affected by osmo- and thermoregulatory stress. Our results did not support the existence of an interplay between environmental temperature and drinking water salinity on most physiological and biochemical traits in Z. capensis, but the negative effect of these two factors on the inflammatory immune response suggests the existence of an energetic trade-off between biological functions that act in parallel to control immune function."

In the present study, we employed a new, four-quadrant choice preference task that allowed zebrafish to swim freely between a live shoal and a motorized mobile shoal, a live shoal and playback of a video-recorded shoal, or a motorized mobile shoal and playback of a video-recorded shoal. Behavior tracking software was used to track subjects' movements in upper and lower quadrants on either side of the test arena.

However, this practice can generate a bias in data analysis, especially when the variables have different temporal patterns. This study aims to use Bayesian Hierarchical Linear Models (B-HLMs) to analyze the feasibility of pooling the aggressive behavior variables of four cichlids species. Additionally, this paper discusses the feasibility of combining variables by examining the usage of different sample sizes and family distributions to aggressive behaviour variables. The subject species were: the angelfish (Pterophyllum scalare), the tiger oscar (Astronotus ocellatus), the Cichlasoma paranaense and the Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus). For each species, 15 groups of 3 individuals were assigned to daily observations (10-min recordings) for 5 days. Aggressive behavior data was labeled according to its aggressive intensity. The variables chase (C), tail beating (TB), push (P), lateral attack (LA) and bite (B) were classified as high intensity. The variables undulation (U), lateral threat (LT) and frontal displays (FD) were classified as low intensity. These behaviors, however, were not present in all species. Model parameters were estimated by Monte Carlo Markov chains using non-informative priors. B-HLMs were performed to assess the impact probability of each variable in the analysis. Results revealed that when combining variables, the resulting distribution is strongly influenced by only one variable in each category. Moreover, in some cases the aggregate values altered the results, which changed the probabilities of the main variables. Species with low aggressive behavior frequencies, such as A. ocellatus, are more sensitive to this bias. LT was the main low intensity variable for all species, while B was the main high intensity variable for the P. scalare and the O. niloticus. LA was the high intensity category variable that was the most relevant for the C. paranaense and A. ocellatus. Moreover, combining the variables did not impact the feasibility of reducing the sample size when compared to using the most quantitative variable. For all species a sample size of 12 did not change the study conclusions. With respect to family distribution, based on DIC values the Gaussian model is more suitable for most of the studied species. However, caution should be taken, because the Gaussian posterior probability distribution overlapped 0 in some cases, which is biologically impossible in aggressive behaviors. The only exception is the A. ocellatus, which, based on DIC values, was the only species better modeled by a Poisson distribution. Bayesian analysis can be therefore considered a strong tool for analyzing aggressive behavior.",Living with roommates in a shared den: Spatial and temporal segregation among semifossorial mammals.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022506,Behavioural processes,2019 06 10,"Positive interspecific interactions in animal communities (i.e. den sharing) have long been overlooked in animal ecology.

Intensive camera trapping (September 2015-September 2018) was used to estimate the interspecific overlap of both temporal and spatial activity patterns for all species combinations. An extensive nocturnal temporal overlap was recorded among all the species, except the diurnal pine marten. However, crested porcupines were mostly active in the darkest nights, whereas bright moonlight enhanced the hunting success of the red fox. Activity of badgers was limited in bright nights only during cold months, when predation pressure and poaching risk were the highest. Crested porcupines avoided spatial sharing outside the den with both nocturnal carnivores, particularly during the winter, when its cubs are in the den. Overlap in ranging areas and activity rhythms between the red fox and the Eurasian badger may be promoted by a remarkable food niche partitioning. Conversely, spatiotemporal overlap between red foxes and pine martens suggested a significant interspecific spatial partitioning, due to the overlap in feeding habits. Den-sharing represents a form of positive interspecific interaction which may limit energy waste and increase local species diversity and densities. Species using the same burrow system may show both spatial and temporal niche partitioning throughout the year, thus allowing a non-competitive coexistence.",Photochemically stabilized formulation of dacarbazine with reduced production of algogenic photodegradants.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022505,International journal of pharmaceutics,2019 05 18,"The present study aimed to develop a photochemically stabilized formulation of dacarbazine [5-(3,3-dimethyl-1-triazeno)imidazole-4-carboxamide; DTIC] for reducing the production of algogenic photodegradant (5-diazoimidazole-4-carboxamide; Diazo-IC). Photochemical properties of DTIC were characterized by UV-visible light spectral analysis, reactive oxygen species (ROS) assay, and photostability testing. A pharmacokinetic study was conducted after intravenous administration of DTIC formulations (1 mg-DTIC/kg) to rats. DTIC exhibited strong absorption in the UVA range, and photoirradiated DTIC exhibited marked ROS generation. Thus, DTIC had high photoreactive potential. After exposure of DTIC (1 mM) to simulated sunlight (250 W/m2) for 3 min, remaining DTIC and yielded Diazo-IC were estimated to be ca. 230 μM and 600 μM, respectively. The addition of radical scavenger (1 mM), including l-ascorbic acid, l-cysteine (Cys), l-histidine, D-mannitol, l-tryptophan, or l-tyrosine, to DTIC (1 mM) could attenuate DTIC photoreactions, and in particular, the addition of Cys to DTIC brought ca. 34% and 86% inhibition of DTIC photodegradation and Diazo-IC photogeneration, respectively. There were no significant differences in the calculated pharmacokinetic parameters of DTIC between DTIC and DTIC with Cys (0.67 mg/kg). From these findings, the supplementary use of Cys would be an effective approach to improve the photostability of DTIC with less production of Diazo-IC.",Hot melt extrusion of heat-sensitive and high melting point drug: Inhibit the recrystallization of the prepared amorphous drug during extrusion to improve the bioavailability.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022504,International journal of pharmaceutics,2019 06 02,"Using tadalafil (TD) as a representative of heat-sensitive drug with high melting point and strong crystallization tendency, we observed that recrystallization of the prepared amorphous materials during extrusion can result in failure of amorphous solid dispersion (ASD) extrusion. Such recrystallization process of amorphous TD during reheating process was investigated systematically. Our results show that spray-dried amorphous TD sample is more prone to recrystallize (occurs from 150 °C) in comparison to the melt-quenched amorphous TD sample (recrystallizes from 190 °C). Poor stability of the spray-dried TD sample is likely due to an excessive amount of available surface area. Co-extruding Soluplus with spray-dried amorphous TD at 160 °C could yield ASD at 10% drug loading and crystalline solid dispersion above 20% drug loading. The method that spray drying 20% TD with 80% Soluplus and then extruding the spray-dried sample can obtain ASD at 20% drug loading at 160 °C, 142 °C lower than the melting point of TD (302 °C). More importantly, the samples prepared by such strategy exhibited a substantially improved bioavailability compared to the samples that were prepared by either spray-dried or hot-melt extruded processes.","Potential of biocompatible polymeric ultra-thin films, nanosheets, as topical and transdermal drug delivery devices.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022503,International journal of pharmaceutics,2019 06 02,"The aim of the present study was to assess the potential of biocompatible polymeric nanosheets as topical and transdermal drug-delivery devices. Nanosheets are two-dimensional nanostructures with a thickness in the nanometer order, and their extremely large aspect ratios result in unique properties, including high transparency, flexibility, and adhesiveness. Nanosheet formulations containing betamethasone valerate (BV) as a model drug and consisting of poly (L-lactic acid) or poly (lactic-co-glycolic) acid were fabricated through a spin-coating-assisted layer-by-layer method using a water-soluble sacrificial membrane. The fabricated formulations could incorporate and release higher amounts of BV compared with a commercial ointment, and the amounts could be controlled by the polymers used, the amount of BV added, and the use of controlled-release membranes. The presence of BV had a minimal effect on thickness, transparency, adhesiveness, and moisture permeability of nanosheets, permitting their application to any area of skin for a long period of time. Therefore, this biocompatible polymeric nanosheet formulation represents a novel and promising topical and transdermal drug delivery device, which has potential to deliver drugs regardless of the area of skin.",Oxaliplatin-loaded chemically cross-linked hydrogels for prevention of postoperative abdominal adhesion and colorectal cancer therapy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022502,International journal of pharmaceutics,2019 06 02,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer among both men and women worldwide. New therapeutic strategies involving cytoreductive surgery and intra-peritoneal chemotherapy could lead to a definitive cure in some cases. However, postoperative intra-abdominal adhesion can cause further complications. In this study, hyaluronic acid (HA)- and carboxymethyl cellulose sodium (CMCNa)-based novel cross-linked hydrogels (HC hydrogels) were synthesized and fully characterized. We demonstrated that varied compositions of HA and CMCNa altered the microstructure, rheology, and degradation behavior of hydrogels. Pre-constructed hydrogels were further loaded with oxaliplatin to prevent intra-abdominal adhesion following chemotherapy. Sustained release of oxaliplatin was observed from hydrogels compared that from solutions, which release drugs through diffusion, following the Higuchi and Korsmeyer-Peppas models. Moreover, low adhesion scores in an in vivo SD rat model demonstrated inhibition of intra-peritoneal adhesion in response to HC hydrogels. Therefore, HC hydrogels offer a novel formulation strategy for providing an intra-abdominal anti-adhesion barrier after cytoreductive surgery and intra-peritoneal chemotherapy for CRC treatment.",Encapsulation of anticancer drug curcumin and co-loading with photosensitizer hypericin into lipoproteins investigated by fluorescence resonance energy transfer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022501,International journal of pharmaceutics,2019 05 18,"Low-density lipoproteins (LDL) and high-density lipoproteins (HDL) are natural occurring vehicles attractive for drug delivery and targeting tumor cells. Here we have investigated the encapsulation and interaction of a well-known anticancer agent curcumin with LDL and HDL. LDL particles have been found to accumulate more curcumin molecules inside their structure than HDL. The chemical stability of curcumin is enhanced and its photo-physical properties are altered due to encapsulation inside both lipoproteins. Combining photodynamic therapy with chemotherapy can improve anticancer treatment by overcoming drug resistance in cancer therapy. Therefore, we have also investigated a co-loading of curcumin with a natural potent photosensitizer hypericin into molecules of LDL using fluorescence resonance energy transfer. The loading patterns of curcumin and hypericin into LDL particles were found to be different as revealed by the fluorescence resonance energy transfer experiments. Present study illustrates the potential of LDL nanoparticles in combination therapy because of simultaneous loading of more than one type of drugs into these nanoparticles with high level of efficiency."

Sixty-four mice were randomly divided into four groups and administered 0, 200, 400 or 800 mg/kg/d body weight APS via gavage for 28 days. The blood parameters and metabolites, viscera indices, antioxidant enzyme activities and intestinal morphology were measured. The results showed that the oral administration of APS improved the immune functions of mice, significantly enhanced the white blood cells and lymphocyte counts, and led to improvements in spleen and thymus indices. APS exhibited significant antioxidant activity by enhancing total antioxidant capacity, superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase activities in heart, kidney and liver, and decreasing the malondialdehyde levels of heart and liver. Moreover, administration of APS potently enhanced the small intestinal villous height and the villus-to-crypt ratio, and decreased the crypt depth of duodenum in mice. Therefore, we can conclude that APS possesses pronounced immunomodulatory activities, and plays an important role in the prevention of oxidative stresses and in the improvement of intestinal morphology in the immunological system in vivo.

This paper describes the first trial for enzymatic production of TFs by recombinant polyphenol oxidases (PPOs). PPO genes were cloned from nine species and expressed in E. coli. Crude enzyme assays by LC-MS revealed that eight recombinant PPOs were active for TFs production from tea polyphenols as substrates. Much higher activities were observed for crude enzymes of Md2 from Malus domestica (apple), Pp4 from Pyrus pashia (pear), and Ej2 from Eriobotrya japonica (loquat). When immobilized on mesoporous silica, crude Md2 was most active. The purified Md2 was immobilized and showed almost twice activity as high as its free enzyme. While the maximum activity of free enzyme was found at pH 5 and 10-30 °C, the immobilized enzyme had broader range of pH 4-6 and 10-40 °C. The activity of immobilized enzyme was relatively constant during the pH and thermal stability test.

Combined with FT-IR, XRD, Raman, TGA, XPS and SEM results, it was indicated that functionalized CCNT (PCCNT) is a reinforcer through hydrogen bond interactions in the aerogel formation process, which could be the main reason for the enhancement. The swelling and vitro release behavior of KGM/PCCNT aerogels were studied under two conditions using the drug 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). The release amount of 5-FU incorporated into KGM/PCCNT4 aerogel was about 48% at pH 1.2 and 62% at pH 6.8 after11 h, respectively. The results showed that the release rate of 5-FU from the KGM/PCCNT4 aerogel using PCCNT could be effectively controlled, suggesting potential applications for it as a drug carrier in targeted delivery in the biomedical filed.",Degradation enhances the anticoagulant and antiplatelet activities of polysaccharides from Lycium barbarum L. leaves.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022485,International journal of biological macromolecules,2019 06 04,"In the current study, a carboxyl-rich polysaccharide purified from Lycium barbarum L. leaves (hereafter, LP) and its degradation with ascorbic acid and hydrogen peroxide were characterized. Degradation decreased the molecular weight of LP from 4.63 × 104 to 3.45 × 104 Da, and increased its zeta potential from -8.01 to -5.35 mV. In vitro experiments showed that degradation significantly increased the anticoagulant activity and, in particular, antiplatelet activity of LP (p < 0.05). The polysaccharide with the highest degree of degradation had higher inhibitory activity than aspirin against arachidonic acid- and thrombin-induced platelet aggregation at 0.5 g/mL. A reduction in uronic acids between LP and its degradation products significantly decreased their antiplatelet activity (p < 0.05). Further analysis confirmed that polysaccharides changed from a compact spherical structure to a random coil in aqueous solution following degradation, which facilitated the interaction of polysaccharides and platelets.",Chain structure and immunomodulatory activity of a fructosylated chondroitin from an engineered Escherichia coli K4.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022484,International journal of biological macromolecules,2019 06 04,"Polysaccharide K4 expressed from E. coli K4 has a similar structure with chondroitin, which can be used as a precursor to produce chondroitin sulfates. Here, we investigated the structure, conformation and biological activity of K4 from an engineered strain with high productivity. The NMR analysis suggested that K4 from wild-type strain with a low yield was a partially fructosylated chondroitin. While K4 from engineered strain was a fully fructosylated chondroitin. Light scattering analysis gave the Mw values of 6.15 × 104, 8.23 × 104 and 1.92 × 104 for K4-1, K4-2 and defructosylated K4 (DK4), respectively. The exponents of functions <S2>z1/2 = f(Mw) were in the range of 0.643-0.608, suggesting a random coil conformation for K4 and DK4.

In this work, a magnetite imprinted chitosan polymer nanocomposites (Fe-CS NCs) were synthesized and applied for the adsorptive removal of ciprofloxacin (CIFO) as a model fluoroquinolone antibiotics. The composition and surface morphology of Fe-CS NCs were studied by SEM, BET, XRD, TEM, FTIR and zeta potential meter. Modelling and optimization of adsorption process were studied using response surface methodology (RSM). The reliability of the RSM models was tested by fitting the data. A comparative analysis of the results derived from the models demonstrated that the second-order model was the best. From the contour plotting results, at pH < pHiep low adsorption rate was observed due to protonation of the chitosan NH2 groups, whereas the adsorption rate was significantly enhanced and achieved to a maximum level at pH 6 due to the electrostatic interactions and hydrophobic interactions. Under optimum conditions, maximum removal efficiency and maximum adsorption capacity were obtained 68% and 142 mg/g, respectively.

The present study was designed to investigate the protective effect of herb pair Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge-Radix Puerariae (DG) on diabetic vascular injury induced by streptozotocin. The protective effect of DG was determined by oral administration of DG (50 and 200 mg/kg) in rats and on high glucose (HG)-induced endothelial injury. DG showed no effect on body weight, fasting blood glucose (FBG) but decreased the serum levels of insulin, nitric oxide (NO), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), malondialdehyde (MDA), soluble intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (s-ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (s-VCAM-1), and increased superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) levels. The pathological alterations of aorta was improved by DG. Furthermore, the increased expression of ICAM-1,VCAM-1, NOX2, and NOX4 in aorta were inhibited by DG. HG-induced endothelial ROS formation, ICAM-1,VCAM-1, NOX4 expression and monocyte-endothelial adhesion were dramatically suppressed by DG as well. In addition, both GKT137831, a NOX4 inhibitor, and PDTC, a NF-κB inhibitor, could significantly inhibited HG-induced ICAM-1, VCAM-1 expression and monocyte-endothelial adhesion.

We previously demonstrated that beta and gamma oscillations occurrence in the olfactory bulb (OB) is modulated by the physical properties of the odorant. However, it remains unknown whether such odor-related modulation of oscillatory patterns is maintained in the piriform cortex (PC) and whether those patterns are similar between the anterior PC (aPC) and posterior PC (pPC). The present study was designed to analyze how different odorant molecular features can affect the local field potential (LFP) oscillatory signals in both the aPC and the pPC in anesthetized rats. As reported in the OB, three oscillatory patterns were observed: standard pattern (gamma + beta), gamma-only and beta-only patterns. These patterns occurred with significantly different probabilities in the two PC areas. We observed that odor identity has a strong influence on the probability of occurrence of LFP beta and gamma oscillatory activity in the aPC. Thus, some odor coding mechanisms observed in the OB are retained in the aPC. By contrast, probability of occurrence of different oscillatory patterns is homogeneous in the pPC with beta-only pattern being the most prevalent one for all the different odor families. Overall, our results confirmed the functional heterogeneity of the PC with its anterior part tightly coupled with the OB and mainly encoding odorant features whereas its posterior part activity is not correlated with odorant features but probably more involved in associative and multi-sensory encoding functions.","HDAC2, but not HDAC1, regulates Kv1.2 expression to mediate neuropathic pain in CCI rats.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022463,Neuroscience,2019 06 16,"The expression of potassium ion channel subunit 1.2 (Kv1.2) in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) influences the excitability of neurons, which contributes to the induction and development of neuropathic pain (NPP); however, the molecular mechanisms underlying the downregulation of Kv1.2 in NPP remain unknown. Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors are reported to attenuate the development of pain hypersensitivity in rats with NPP. Whether HDAC inhibitors contribute to regulation of Kv1.2 expression, and which specific HDAC subunit is involved in NPP, remain unexplored. In this study we established a chronic constrictive injury (CCI) model and used western blot, quantitative real-time PCR, immunostaining, intrathecal injection, and siRNA methods to explore which HDAC subunit is involved in regulating Kv1.2 expression to mediate NPP. Our results demonstrated that nerve injury led to upregulation of HDAC1 expression in the DRG, and of HDAC2 in the DRG and spinal cord. Double-labeling immunofluorescence histochemistry showed that Kv1.2 principally co-localized with HDAC2, but not HDAC1, in NF200-positive large neurons of the DRG. Intrathecal injection with the HDAC inhibitor, suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid, attenuated mechanical and thermal hypersensitivity and reversed the decreased expression of Kv1.2 in rats with CCI. Furthermore, treatment with HDAC2, but not HDAC1, siRNA also relieved mechanical and thermal hypersensitivity and upregulated the Kv1.2 expression in this model. In vitro transfection of PC12 cells with HDAC2 and HDAC1 siRNA confirmed that only HDAC2 siRNA could regulate the expression of Kv1.2. These findings suggest that HDAC2, but not HDAC1, is involved in NPP through regulation of Kv1.2 expression.",Modulation of acid sensing ion channel dependent protonergic neurotransmission at the mouse calyx of Held.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022462,Neuroscience,2019 05 10,"Acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) regulate synaptic activities and play important roles in neurodegenerative diseases. It has been reported that homomeric ASIC-1a channels are expressed in neurons of the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB) of the auditory system in the CNS. During synaptic transmission, acidification of the synaptic cleft presumably due to the co-release of neurotransmitter and H+ from synaptic vesicles activates postsynaptic ASIC-1a channels in mice up to 3 weeks old. This generates synaptic currents (ASIC1a-SCs) that add to the glutamatergic excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs). Here we report that neuromodulators like histamine and natural products like lactate and spermine potentiate ASIC1a-SCs in an additive form such that excitatory ASIC synaptic currents as well as the associated calcium influx become significantly large and physiologically relevant. We show that ASIC1a-SCs enhanced by endogenous neuromodulators are capable of supporting synaptic transmission in the absence of glutamatergic EPSCs. Furthermore, at high frequency stimulation (HFS), ASIC1a-SCs contribute to diminish short term depression (STD) and their contribution is even more relevant at early stages of development. Since ASIC channels are present in almost all types of neurons and synaptic vesicles content is acid, the participation of protons in synaptic transmission and its potentiation by endogenous substances could be a general phenomenon across the central nervous system.",Psammaplysin F increases the efficacy of bortezomib and sorafenib through regulation of stress granule formation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022461,The international journal of biochemistry & cell biology,2019 06 11,"The past few decades have delivered significant improvements in diagnosis and treatment of cancer, however, despite these improvements cancer continues to be a major global health issue requiring the urgent development of new strategies for treatment. Stress granules are cytoplasmic structures that triage gene expression in response to environmental stresses, including chemotherapies, and have been implicated in the development of drug resistance. One novel approach to developing a new anti-cancer strategy involves inhibiting stress granules with compounds derived from natural products. In a previous rapid screen, a subset of 132 compounds from the Davis Open Access Natural Product Library was screened using a stress granule inhibition assay and provisionally one hit was identified which was the known marine sponge-derived metabolite, psammaplysin F. Using cell based assays psammaplysin F was assessed to determine whether it could inhibit the formation of stress granules after exposure to sodium arsenite in Vero, HEK293 MCF7, T47D, HeLa and MCF7MDR cells by analysing the number of stress granules using high content imaging. A significant reduction in the number of stress granules was observed and subsequent analysis by western blot revealed that treatment with psammaplysin F decreased levels of phosphorylated eIF2α. Combinational studies in MCF7, HeLa and MCF7MDR cells revealed that psammaplysin F increased the efficacy of bortezomib and sorafenib and a synergistic effect was observed in vitro. Stress granules appear to be one tool in a battery of responses that cancer cells can exploit to elicit drug resistance. Disrupting stress granule formation by use of orally available drugs presents a potential mechanism to restore drug efficacy. The work presented here provides evidence that small molecules derived from nature, such as psammaplysin F, can prevent the formation of stress granules and therefore may represent a useful strategy to improving drug efficacy.","Reelin: Diverse roles in central nervous system development, health and disease.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022460,The international journal of biochemistry & cell biology,2019 06 11,"Over the past 20 years the structure and function of Reelin, an extracellular glycoprotein with a role in cell migration and positioning during development has been elucidated. Originally discovered in mice exhibiting a peculiar gait and hypoplastic cerebellar tissue, Reelin is secreted from Cajal-Retzius neurons during embryonic life and has been shown to act as a stop signal, guiding migrating radial neurons in a gradient-dependent manner. Reelin carries out its function by binding to the receptors, very low-density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR) and apolipoprotein E receptor 2 (ApoER2) resulting in the phosphorylation of the intracellular protein Disabled-1 (Dab-1) which is essential for effective Reelin signaling. Abnormalities in the RELN gene can result in multiple unusual structural outcomes including disruption of cortical layers, heterotopia, polymicrogyria and lissencephaly. Recent research has suggested a potential role for Reelin in the pathogenesis of neurological diseases such as schizophrenia, autism and Alzheimer's disease. This short review will address the current understanding of the structure and function of this protein and its emerging role in the development of neurological disorders.",Versatile and multifaceted CRISPR/Cas gene editing tool for plant research.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022459,Seminars in cell & developmental biology,2019 04 28,"The ability to create desirable gene variants through targeted changes offers tremendous opportunities for the advancement of basic and applied plant research. Gene editing technologies have opened new avenues to perform such precise gene modifications in diverse biological systems. These technologies use sequence-specific nucleases, such as homing endonucleases, zinc-finger nucleases, transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-associated protein (CRISPR/Cas) complexes to enable targeted genetic manipulations. Among these, the CRISPR/Cas system has emerged as a broadly applicable and valued gene editing system for its ease of use and versatility. The adaptability of the CRISPR/Cas system has facilitated rapid and continuous innovative developments to the precision and applications of this technology, since its introduction less than a decade ago. Although developed in animal systems, the simple and elegant CRISPR/Cas gene editing technology has quickly been embraced by plant researchers. From early demonstration in model plants, the CRISPR/Cas system has been successfully adapted for various crop species and enabled targeting of agronomically important traits. Although the approach faces several efficiency and delivery related challenges, especially in recalcitrant crop species, continuous advances in the CRISPR/Cas system to address these limitations are being made. In this review, we discuss the CRISPR/Cas technology, its myriad applications and their prospects for crop improvement.",Positron emission tomography studies of organophosphate chemical threats and oxime countermeasures.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022458,Neurobiology of disease,2019 05 11,"There is a unique in vivo interplay involving the mechanism of inactivation of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) by toxic organophosphorus (OP) compounds and the restoration of AChE activity by oxime antidotes. OP compounds form covalent adducts to this critical enzyme target and oximes are introduced to directly displace the OP from AChE. For the most part, the in vivo inactivation of AChE leading to neurotoxicity and antidote-based therapeutic reversal of this mechanism are well understood, however, these molecular-level events have not been evaluated by dynamic imaging in living systems at millimeter resolution. A deeper understanding of these critically, time-dependent mechanisms is needed to develop new countermeasures. To address this void and to help accelerate the development of new countermeasures, positron-emission tomography (PET) has been investigated as a unique opportunity to create platform technologies to directly examine the interdependent toxicokinetic/pharmacokinetic and toxicodynamic/pharmacodynamic features of OPs and oximes in real time within live animals. This review will cover two first-in-class PET tracers representing an OP and an oxime antidote, including their preparation, requisite pharmacologic investigations, mechanistic interpretations, biodistribution and imaging.","Association of high-fat diet with neuroinflammation, anxiety-like defensive behavioral responses, and altered thermoregulatory responses in male rats.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022457,"Brain, behavior, and immunity",2019 04 28,"Overweight and obesity are a worldwide pandemic affecting billions of people. These conditions have been associated with a chronic low-grade inflammatory state that is recognized as a risk factor for a range of somatic diseases as well as neurodevelopmental disorders, anxiety disorders, trauma- and stressor-related disorders, and affective disorders. We previously reported that the ingestion of a high-fat diet (HFD; 45% fat kcal/g) for nine weeks was capable of inducing obesity in rats in association with increased reactivity to stress and increased anxiety-related defensive behavior. In this study, we conducted a nine-week diet protocol to induce obesity in rats, followed by investigation of anxiety-related defensive behavioral responses using the elevated T-maze (ETM), numbers of FOS-immunoreactive cells after exposure of rats to the avoidance or escape task of the ETM, and neuroinflammatory cytokine expression in hypothalamic and amygdaloid nuclei. In addition, we investigated stress-induced cutaneous thermoregulatory responses during exposure to an open-field (OF). Here we demonstrated that nine weeks of HFD intake induced obesity, in association with increased abdominal fat pad weight, increased anxiety-related defensive behavioral responses, and increased proinflammatory cytokines in hypothalamic and amygdaloid nuclei. In addition, HFD exposure altered avoidance- or escape task-induced FOS-immunoreactivity within brain structures involved in control of neuroendocrine, autonomic, and behavioral responses to aversive stimuli, including the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and dorsomedial (DMH), paraventricular (PVN) and ventromedial (VMH) hypothalamic nuclei. Furthermore, rats exposed to HFD, relative to control diet-fed rats, responded with increased tail skin temperature at baseline and throughout exposure to an open-field apparatus. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that HFD induces neuroinflammation, alters excitability of brain nuclei controlling neuroendocrine, autonomic, and behavioral responses to stressful stimuli, and enhances stress reactivity and anxiety-like defensive behavioral responses.",Raman Spectroscopy identifies differences in ochronotic and non-ochronotic cartilage; a potential novel technique for monitoring ochronosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022456,Osteoarthritis and cartilage,2019 05 20,"Alkaptonuria (AKU) is a rare, inherited disorder of tyrosine metabolism, where patients are unable to breakdown homogentisic acid (HGA), which increases systemically over time.

Our blinded study showed that all seven high-risk test compounds, including bepridil, caused early afterdepolarizations (EADs) at mid-high and/or high concentration(s). All hERG channel blockers in the mid-risk category prolonged APD30 and APD90 at mid-high, and then led to EADs at their respective high concentrations; while chlorpromazine, clarithromycin and risperidone showed little effects. In addition, ranolazine was the only low-risk test compound to prolong APD30 and APD90 at mid-high, and then produce EADs at high concentration. In conclusion, our results generally agreed with data from all core-sites of the CiPA consortium using the MEA method. Moreover, our assay can successfully detect pro-arrhythmic risk of drug candidates such as bepridil with superior sensitivity."

Different biological effects have been reported for sulfonamide-based compounds including antibacterial, antifungal, and antitumor activities. Herein, a series of phenylpropanoid-based sulfonamides (4a, 4a', 4b, 4b', 5a, 5a', 5b and 5b') were synthesized and their cytotoxic activity was evaluated against four cell lines derived from human tumours (A549 - lung, MCF-7 - breast, Hep G2 - hepatocellular carcinoma, and HT-144-melanoma). Cell viability was significantly reduced in the MCF-7 cell line when compounds 4b, 4b' and 5a were used; IC50 values were lower than those found for their precursors (eugenol and dihydroeugenol) and sulfanilamide. We observed that 4b induced cell cycle arrest at G1/S transition. This is probably due to its ability to reduce cyclin D1 and cyclin E expression. Moreover, 4b also induced apoptosis in MCF-7 cells as demonstrated by an increase in the cell population positive for annexin V in treated cultures in comparison to the control group. Taken together, the data showed that 4b is a promising antitumor agent and it should be considered for further in vivo studies.",Community Palliative Care Initiatives to Reduce End-of-Life Hospital Utilization and In-Hospital Deaths: A Population-Based Observational Study Evaluating Two Home Care Interventions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022443,Journal of pain and symptom management,2019 06 04,The end-of-life period is characterized by increased hospital utilization despite patients' preferences to receive care and die at home.,Assessing the Impact of Serious Illness on Patient Intimacy and Sexuality in Palliative Care.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022442,Journal of pain and symptom management,2019 05 13,Palliative care (PC) clinical practice guidelines recommend providers assess the impact of illness on intimacy and sexuality.

In modern drug discovery, the proportion of lipophilic drug candidates with poor water solubility has increased, and these lipophilic drugs are known to undergo membrane retention during transport across the cell membrane, depending on the hydrophobic interaction between the drug and lipid molecules. Hence, a precise and effective permeability assay for lipophilic drug compounds, which can also quantify membrane retention, is required. In this study, we developed a permeability assay for lipophilic drugs with poor water solubility using a freestanding lipid bilayer. The lipid bilayer was created within a UV cuvette, and the number of transported molecules through the bilayer was estimated by measuring the UV absorbance over time. We then measured the permeability of six tested compounds, and there was a significant difference in permeability between the Biopharmaceutics Classification System (BCS) class 2 and class 4 compounds. In addition, the fraction of molecules trapped in the lipid bilayer were estimated for each compound as well. As a result, the drugs with higher lipophilicity were found to undergo more membrane retention, which agrees with the previous reports, supporting that our model lipid membrane system could also be applied to investigate the drug-lipid interaction.","Topical nanostructured lipid carriers/inorganic sunscreen combination for alleviation of all-trans retinoic acid-induced photosensitivity: Box-Behnken design optimization, in vitro and in vivo evaluation.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022440,European journal of pharmaceutical sciences : official journal of the European Federation for Pharmaceutical Sciences,2019 05 20,"All-trans retinoic acid is a natural retinoid and the physiologically active metabolite of vitamin A. The aim of the present study is to develop and optimize a nanostructured lipid carrier formulation to enhance the photostability of all-trans retinoic acid and alleviate its skin photosensitivity. Box-Behnken design was used for optimizing dependent variables such as particle size, zeta potential and viscosity. The total lipid (%), liquid lipid (%) and total surfactant (%) were selected as independent variables. The optimized formulation was characterized by particle size of 151 nm, zeta potential of -31 mV and viscosity of 2064 cps. In vitro photoprotection effect of the optimized formulation containing different types and concentrations of inorganic sunscreens was evaluated employing Transpore® tape assay. Sun protection factor and other spectroscopic indices revealed that 6% titanium dioxide was the best choice to be combined with the optimized formulation. After 6 h of ultraviolet A exposure, the optimized formulation and the optimized formulation combined with 6% titanium dioxide enhanced the photostability of all-trans retinoic acid by about 1.5 and 2 times, respectively, compared to its methanolic solution. In vivo photoprotection effect of the developed formulations was conducted on mice exposed to direct sun light for 4 days. Photographs of the mice's skin, biochemical analysis of the pro-inflammatory cytokines in the skin as well as histopathological examination, depicted that the optimized formulation promoted an obvious alleviation of the all-trans retinoic acid-induced photosensitivity, which was further potentiated by the addition of 6% titanium dioxide, compared to the marketed product.",C-Methylated flavanones from the rhizomes of Matteuccia intermedia and their α-glucosidase inhibitory activity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022439,Fitoterapia,2019 06 06,"One new flavanonol, demethylmatteucinol (1), and nine new flavanone glucoside derivatives, matteflavosides H-J (2-4) and matteuinterates A-F (5-10), were isolated from the rhizomes of Matteuccia intermedia C.Chr., along with 21 known flavanones (11-31).

The result showed that the culture grown on xylose exhibited high production yield of cordycepin on dry biomass. Comparing xylose to other carbon sources, a set of significantly up-regulated genes in xylose were enriched in pentose and glucuronate interconversion, and cordycepin biosynthesis. After validating up-regulated genes using quantitative real-time PCR, interestingly, putative alternative 3'-AMP-associated metabolic route on cordycepin biosynthesis was identified. Through reporter metabolites analysis of C. militaris, significant metabolites (e.g., AMP, glycine and L-glutamate) were identified guiding involvement of growth and cordycepin production. These findings suggested that there was a cooperative mechanism in transcriptional control of the supplying precursors pool directed towards the cordycepin biosynthesis through main and putative alternative metabolic routes for leverage of cell growth and cordycepin production on xylose of C. militaris strain TBRC7358.",The role of gonadal hormones in the hypoglossal discharge activity of rats exposed to chronic intermittent hypoxia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022436,Brain research bulletin,2019 06 14,The role of gonadal hormones in chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH)-evoked hypoglossal nerve (XII) neuroplasticity has not been thoroughly studied.

The protein's in vivo role, however, remains poorly defined. Factor XII deficiency, or Hageman trait, is a rare hereditary disorder that is not associated with bleeding, and wide variations in FXII activity (FXII:C) exist among healthy people. While FXII-deficient knockout mice appear to be resistant to arterial thrombosis, human F12 polymorphisms that influence FXII:C have not been associated with thrombotic risk in population surveys. Factor XII deficiency is a naturally occurring hereditary trait in domestic cats. We undertook phenotypic and genotypic analyses of FXII-deficient cats for comparative studies with the human disease counterpart. A retrospective review of feline submissions to our laboratory revealed that FXII deficiency is common in domestic cats, and also present in many different breeds. The trait has a geographic bias toward the Midwestern United States. Clinical history, coagulation assays, and samples for F12 sequencing were obtained from 26 FXII deficient cats. None of the cats had experienced abnormal bleeding and their residual FXII:C was related to F12 mutation number and mutation-type. We found 2 high frequency F12 mutations: an exon 13 missense mutation (c.1631G > C) and an exon 11 deletion mutation (c.1321delC), and additional sequence variants throughout the gene. Factor XII deficiency in pet cat populations provides an animal model system to help clarify the biologic actions and clinical relevance of FXII protein."

Interestingly, increasing numbers of evidence show the therapeutic benefits of mitochondria transfer. Therefore, we hypothesized that injection of exogenous mitochondria would contribute to ameliorate depressive-like symptoms. In this study, the antidepressant-like effect of intravenous isolated mitochondria was evaluated on a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)- induced model of depression. The depressive-like behaviors were assessed using forced swim test (FST), tail suspension test (TST) and sucrose preference test. Besides, the neurogenesis, expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), glial activation, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress and ATP production were determined in the hippocampus. The results showed that treatment of isolated mitochondria decreased the immobility time of mice in the FST and TST, and attenuated the decrease in sucrose preference test. Moreover, isolated mitochondria significantly reduced the activation of astrocyte and microglia as well as neuroinflammation (i.e. 1 L-1β, TNF-α and COX-2), increased BDNF expression and neurogenesis, restored the dysfunction of ATP production and oxidative stress in inflammation- induced depression. Taken together, the data suggested for the first time that injection of isolated mitochondria ameliorated LPS- induced depressive-like behaviors.

These mood disorders are associated with structural alterations of neural architecture in limbic brain regions that control emotion, mood and cognition. Structural remodeling may either be a sign of successful adaptation, or of failure to do so. In neuropsychiatric disorders like depression structural remodeling involves apoptosis, reduced neurogenesis, and structural remodeling of neuronal dendrites which most likely reflects the latter. Here we review key findings from animal models of psychosocial stress that have been used to gain insights into the relation between stress-related behavioral disorders like depression and structural plasticity. Specifically, we focus on models having a high face validity like social defeat stress in the resident-intruder paradigm and chronic stress of social subordination in social housing conditions. Moderate to severe social stress appears to stimulate plasticity and neuronal growth in regions of the amygdala, whereas the effects in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex tend to be opposite. A major focus of the current review is to characterize social stress induced structural changes in these brain regions, aiming to provide insight in pathways and factors that underlie behavioral effects of stress and depression.",Cholinergic modulation of motor neurons through the C-boutons are necessary for the locomotor compensation for severe motor neuron loss during amyotrophic lateral sclerosis disease progression.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022419,Behavioural brain research,2019 06 01,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is an adult-onset neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive motor neuron (MN) death that leads to muscle weakness, paralysis, and eventually death. When symptoms become clinically evident, patients and ALS model animals (mSod1G93A mice) have already lost a large portion of motor units, suggesting the existence of a compensatory mechanism that allows for reactively normal movement despite denervation. Furthermore, it has been shown that specialized cholinergic synapses, the C-boutons, regulate activity strength of motor output in a task dependent manner. We hypothesized that the cholinergic modulation of motor neurons through C-boutons increases motor neuron excitability, and that this C-bouton associated activity increase in surviving motor neurons could compensate for motor unit loss during ALS disease progression. We first provide a thorough analysis of the muscle denervation and behavioral changes in the mSod1G93A mice using immunohistology, electrophysiology, and quantitative analysis of locomotor behavior. Then, in support of our hypothesis, we show that task dependent modulation of hindlimb muscle activation that relies on C-bouton activation diminishes as the disease progresses. Furthermore, the capability of mSod1G93A mice to walk at higher speeds on a treadmill decreases significantly at younger ages when C-boutons are silenced. Our observations that C-bouton modulation of motor neurons is involved in compensation during ALS disease progression can have significant therapeutic implications for sustaining mobility and preserving the quality of life in human ALS patients.",Electrochemical detection of food-spoiling bacteria using interdigitated platinum microelectrodes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022418,Journal of microbiological methods,2019 05 24,"The fast and non-destructive detection of bacterial attachment on food contact surfaces is important for the prevention of the unwanted formation of biofilms.

Alterations in β-catenin (encoded by CTNNB1) and microsatellite instability (MSI), as well as changes in the expression levels of HNF-1β and DNA mismatch repair (MMR) proteins were investigated in 50 OEmCas and 21 OCCCas with endometriotic lesions. Mutations of CTNNB1 were identified in 28 (56%) of the 50 OEmCa cases and 26 (41.9%) of the 62 coexisting endometriosis lesions. MSI-high (H) was observed in seven (14.6%) of the 48 OEmCa and 14 (23.3%) of the 60 coexisting endometriosis, and was significantly associated with loss of MMR protein expression, but not CTNNB1 mutations. Non-identical CTNNB1 status between two different epithelial lesions within endometriosis was observed in eight out of 10 informative endometriosis cases that had adjacent OEmCa. Similar findings for MSI features were also found in two out of three informative cases, suggesting that endometriotic lesions may predominantly consist of polyclonal cells. In contrast, high HNF-1β expression was significantly associated with SLC3A1 expression, which plays a major role in HNF-1β-triggered induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in OCCCas, independent of abnormalities in both β-catenin and MSI/MMR status. Finally, four inflammatory parameters associated with repeated hemorrhaging in endometriosis were significantly higher in endometriosis with MSI-H when compared to that with MSS, independent of both β-catenin and HNF-1β status. In conclusion, different molecular pathways including alterations in β-catenin, MSI, and HNF-1β levels may contribute to tumorigenesis in endometriosis-associated carcinoma.",Molecular and genetic characterization of the pOV plasmid from Pasteurella multocida and construction of an integration vector for Gallibacterium anatis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022414,Plasmid,2019 05 21,"The pOV plasmid isolated from the Pasteurella multocida strain PMOV is a new plasmid, and its molecular characterization is important for determining its gene content and its replicative properties in Pasteurellaceae family bacteria."

While some of the eyes show a clinical resolution of the injury (defined as clinically non-impaired), part of the eyes develop irreversible late ocular pathologies (defined as clinically impaired) that may lead to corneal blindness. Understanding the pathological mechanisms underlying the development of the late pathology may lead to improved treatment options. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the mRNA expression profiles of corneas from clinically impaired, clinically non-impaired and naïve eyes. Rabbit eyes were exposed to SM vapor and a clinical follow-up was carried out up to 4 weeks using a slit lamp microscope. At this time point, corneal tissues from clinically impaired, clinically non-impaired and naïve eyes were processed for RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and differential expression analyses. The differential expression profiles were further subjected to pathway enrichment analysis using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). Real-time PCR was used for RNA-seq validation. The late pathology developed in 54%-80% of the eyes following ocular exposure to SM, clinically manifested by inflammation, corneal opacity and neovascularization. RNA-seq results showed significant differences in mRNA levels of hundreds of genes between clinically impaired, clinically non-impaired and naïve corneas. Pathway enrichment analysis showed common pathways that were activated in all of the exposed eyes, such as Th1 and Th2 activation pathway, in addition to pathways that were activated only in the clinically impaired eyes compared to the clinically non-impaired eyes, such as IL-6 and ERK5 signaling. Corneal mRNA expression profiles for the clinically impaired, clinically non-impaired and naïve eyes generated a comprehensive database that revealed new factors and pathways, which for the first time were shown to be involved in SM-induced late pathology. Our data may contribute to the research on both the pathological mechanisms that are involved in the development of the late pathology and the protective pathways that are activated in the clinically non-impaired eyes and may point out towards novel therapeutic strategies for this severe ocular injury.",Responses of retinal arterioles and ciliary arteries in pigs with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022399,Experimental eye research,2019 06 14,"Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a clinical syndrome of acute lung failure in critically sick patients, which severely compromises the function of multiple organs, including the brain. Although, the optic nerve and the retina are a part of the central nervous system, the effects of ARDS on these ocular structures are completely unknown. Thus, the major goal of this study was to test the hypothesis that ARDS affects vascular function in the eye. ARDS was induced in anesthetized pigs by intratracheal injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Sham-treated animals served as controls. Pigs were monitored for 8 h and then sacrificed. Subsequently, retinal arterioles and short posterior ciliary arteries were isolated and cannulated with micropipettes to measure vascular responses by videomicroscopy. Levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were quantified in isolated vessels using dihydroethidium (DHE). Messenger RNA expression of hypoxic, inflammatory, prooxidative, and antioxidative genes was assessed by real-time PCR. When group-dependent differences in mRNA expression levels were found for a particular gene, immunostainings were conducted. Strikingly, responses to the endothelium-dependent vasodilator, bradykinin, were markedly impaired in retinal arterioles of LPS-treated pigs, but no differences were seen between ciliary arteries of LPS- and sham-treated animals. ROS levels were increased in retinal arterioles but not in ciliary arteries of LPS-treated pigs. Messenger RNA levels for HIF-1α, VEGF-A and NOX2 were markedly increased in retinal arterioles of LPS-treated pigs, whereas ciliary arteries had only negligible mRNA level changes. Pronounced immunoreactivity for HIF-1α, VEGF-A and NOX2 was seen in the endothelium of retinal arterioles from LPS-treated pigs. Histologically, massive edema was seen especially in the retinal nerve fiber layer of pigs treated with LPS. Our study provides the first evidence that ARDS induced by intratracheal LPS application evokes endothelial dysfunction in porcine retinal arterioles together with retinal edema, indicative of vascular leakage. In contrast, ciliary arteries appear to be resistant to intratracheal LPS application.",Decreased lysyl oxidase level protects against development of retinal vascular lesions in diabetic retinopathy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022398,Experimental eye research,2019 06 14,"Retinal capillary basement membrane (BM) thickening is closely associated with the development of vascular lesions in diabetic retinopathy. Thickened capillary BM can compromise blood-retinal-barrier characteristics and contribute to retinal vascular permeability, a significant clinical manifestation of diabetic retinopathy. We have previously shown that high glucose increases the expression and activity of lysyl oxidase (LOX), a crosslinking enzyme, in retinal endothelial cells. Additionally, concomitant with overexpression of LOX, increased vascular permeability was observed in diabetic rat retinas. However, it is unknown whether decreasing LOX overexpression may have protective effects against development of retinal vascular lesions in diabetes. To investigate whether reduced LOX level protects against diabetes-induced development of retinal vascular lesions characteristic of diabetic retinopathy, four groups of mice: wild type (WT) control mice, streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mice, LOX +/- mice, and STZ-induced diabetic LOX +/- mice were used for this study. Diabetes was maintained for 16 weeks; at the end of the study, retinas were assessed for LOX protein level by Western Blot (WB) analysis, and retinal capillary networks were isolated using retinal trypsin digestion and stained with hematoxylin and periodic acid Schiff to identify the number of acellular capillaries (AC) and pericyte loss (PL). In parallel, TUNEL assay was performed on retinal trypsin digests (RTDs) to detect cells undergoing apoptosis in the retinal capillary networks. Retinal vascular permeability was analyzed following FITC-dextran injection in retinal whole mounts. A significant increase in LOX expression was detected in the diabetic retinas compared to those of the WT control retinas, and as expected, a significant decrease in LOX expression in the diabetic LOX +/- retinas was observed compared to those of the diabetic retinas. RTD images showed significantly increased AC and PL counts in the retinas of diabetic mice compared to those of the WT control mice. Importantly, the number of AC and PL was significantly decreased, as was retinal vascular permeability in the retinas of the diabetic LOX +/- mice compared to those of the diabetic mice. Results suggest that decreasing diabetes-induced LOX overexpression may have protective effects against the development of vascular lesions characteristic of diabetic retinopathy. Therefore, LOX overexpression may be a potential target in preventing retinal vascular cell loss and excess permeability associated with diabetic retinopathy.",Reduced tongue force and functional swallowing changes in a rat model of post stroke dysphagia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022397,Brain research,2019 05 21,"Dysphagia is a common problem after stroke that is often associated with tongue weakness. However, the physiological mechanisms of post-stroke tongue muscle weakness and optimal treatments have not been established. To advance understanding of physiological mechanisms of post stroke dysphagia, we sought to validate the unilateral transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) rat model of ischemic stroke as a translational model of post stroke dysphagia. Our goal was to establish clinically relevant measures and chronicity of functional deficits; criteria that increase the likelihood that findings will translate to the clinic. We hypothesized that MCAO would cause tongue weakness and functional swallowing changes.","The effects of flavonoids on human first trimester trophoblast spheroidal stem cell self-renewal, invasion and JNK/p38 MAPK activation: Understanding the cytoprotective effects of these phytonutrients against oxidative stress.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022396,Biochemical pharmacology,2019 05 17,"Adequate invasion and complete remodelling of the maternal spiral arteries by the invading extravillous trophoblasts are the major determinants of a successful pregnancy. Increase in oxidative stress during pregnancy has been linked to the reduction in trophoblast invasion and incomplete conversion of the maternal spiral arteries, resulting in pregnancy complications such as pre-eclampsia, intrauterine growth restriction, and spontaneous miscarriages resulting in foetal/maternal mortality. The use of antioxidant therapy (vitamin C and E) and other preventative treatments (such as low dose aspirin) have been ineffective in preventing pre-eclampsia. Also, as the majority of antihypertensive drugs pose side effects, choosing an appropriate treatment would depend upon the efficacy and safety of mother/foetus. Since pre-eclampsia is mainly linked to placental oxidative stress, new diet-based antioxidants can be of use to prevent this condition. The antioxidant properties of flavonoids (naturally occurring phenolic compounds which are ubiquitously distributed in fruits and vegetables) have been well documented in non-trophoblast cells. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effects of flavonoids (quercetin, hesperidin) and their metabolites (Quercetin 3-O-β-glucuronide and hesperetin), either alone or in combination, on first trimester trophoblast cell line HTR-8/SVneo during oxidative stress. The data obtained from this study indicate that selected flavonoids, their respective metabolites significantly reduced the levels of reduced glutathione (p < 0.0001) during HR-induced oxidative stress. These flavonoids also inhibited the activation of pro-apoptotic kinases (p38 MAPK and c-Jun N-terminal kinase) during HR-induced phosphorylation. In addition, they enhanced spheroid stem-like cell generation from HTR8/SVneo cells, aiding their invasion. Our data suggest that dietary intake of food rich in quercetin or hesperidin during early pregnancy can significantly improve trophoblast (placenta) health and function against oxidative stress.",Applying a multiplexed primer extension method on dried blood spots increased the detection of carriers at risk of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency in newborn screening program.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022393,Clinica chimica acta; international journal of clinical chemistry,2019 06 16,"Patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency might develop acute hemolytic anemia, chronic hemolytic anemia, and neonatal hyperbilirubinemia when exposed to high levels of oxidative stress.

However, 80%-85% of female carriers were undetected in an existing newborn screening program because of their wide-ranging levels of enzyme activity.",A proteomic comparison of excretion/secretion products in Fasciola hepatica newly excysted juveniles (NEJ) derived from Lymnaea viatrix or Pseudosuccinea columella.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022392,Experimental parasitology,2019 06 04,"The characteristics of parasitic infections are often tied to host behavior. Although most studies have investigated definitive hosts, intermediate hosts can also play a role in shaping the distribution and accumulation of parasites. This is particularly relevant in larval stages, where intermediate host's behavior could potentially interfere in the molecules secreted by the parasite into the next host during infection. To investigate this hypothesis, we used a proteomic approach to analyze excretion/secretion products (ESP) from Fasciola hepatica newly excysted juveniles (NEJ) derived from two intermediate host species, Lymnaea viatrix and Pseudosuccinea columella. The two analyzed proteomes showed differences in identity, abundance, and functional classification of the proteins. This observation could be due to differences in the biological cycle of the parasite in the host, environmental aspects, and/or host-dependent factors. Categories such as protein modification machinery, protease inhibitors, signal transduction, and cysteine-rich proteins showed different abundance between samples. More specifically, differences in abundance of individual proteins such as peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase, thioredoxin, cathepsin B, cathepsin L, and Kunitz-type inhibitors were identified. Based on the differences identified between NEJ ESP samples, we can conclude that the intermediate host is a factor influencing the proteomic profile of ESP in F. hepatica.","Data science, artificial intelligence, and machine learning: Opportunities for laboratory medicine and the value of positive regulation.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022391,Clinical biochemistry,2019 05 03,"Artificial intelligence (AI) and data science are rapidly developing in healthcare, as is their translation into laboratory medicine.

Here, we examined IGF-1 pathway responses to long- and short-term variation in food availability in copper rockfish (Sebastes caurinus), a nearshore Pacific rockfish important for commercial and recreational fisheries. Juvenile copper rockfish were raised under differing ration amounts (3% or 9% mass feed·g-1 fish wet mass·day-1) for 140 d to simulate 'long-term' feeding variation, after which some fish from both rations were fasted for 12 d to generate 'short-term' conditions of food deprivation. Rockfish on the 9% ration treatment grew more quickly than those on the 3% ration and were larger in mass, length, and body condition (k) after 152 d. Fish on the 9% ration had higher blood glucose than those on the 3% ration, with fasting decreasing blood glucose in both ration treatments, indicating that both long-term and short-term feed treatments altered energy status. Plasma IGF-1 was higher in rockfish from the 9% ration than those in the 3% ration and was also higher in fed fish than fasted fish. Additionally, plasma IGF-1 related positively to individual variation in specific growth rate (SGR). The positive association between IGF-1 and SGR showed discordance in fish that had experienced different levels of food and growth over the long-term but not short-term, suggesting that long-term nutritional experience can influence the relationship between IGF-1 and growth in this species. Rockfish on the 3% ration showed a lower relative abundance of gene transcripts encoding igf1 in the liver, but higher hepatic mRNAs for IGF binding proteins igfbp1a and igfbp1b. Fasting similarly decreased the abundance of igf1 mRNAs in the liver of fish reared under both the 9% and 3% rations, while concurrently increasing mRNAs encoding the IGF binding proteins igfbp1a, -1b, and -3a. Hepatic mRNAs for igfbp2b, -5a, and -5b were lower with long-term ration variation (3% ration) and fasting. Fish that experienced long-term reduced rations also had higher mRNA levels for igfbp3a, -3b, and IGF receptors isoforms A (igf1rA) and B (igf1rB) in skeletal muscle, but lower mRNA levels for igf1. Fasting increased muscle mRNA abundance for igfbp3a, igf1rA, and igf1rB, and decreased levels for igfbp2a and igf1. These data show that a positive relationship between circulating IGF-1 and individual growth rate is maintained in copper rockfish even when that growth variation relates to differences in food consumption across varying time scales, but that long- and short-term variation in food quantity can shift basal concentrations of circulating IGF-1 in this species."

Identifying the substrate specificities of membrane transport proteins is closely related to protein-target interaction prediction, drug design, membrane recruitment, and dysregulation analysis, thus being an important problem for bioinformatics researchers. In this study, we applied word embedding approach, the main cause for natural language processing breakout in recent years, to protein sequences of transporters. We defined each protein sequence based on the word embeddings and frequencies of its biological words. The protein features were then fed into machine learning models for prediction. We also varied the lengths of protein sequence's constituent biological words to find the optimal length which generated the most discriminative feature set. Compared to four other feature types created from protein sequences, our proposed features can help prediction models yield superior performance. Our best models reach an average area under the curve of 0.96 and 0.99, respectively on the 5-fold cross validation and the independent test. With this result, our study can help biologists identify transporters based on substrate specificities as well as provides a basis for further research that enriches a field of applying natural language processing techniques in bioinformatics.",Integrated immunochromatographic assay for qualitative and quantitative detection of clenbuterol.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022377,Analytical biochemistry,2019 06 04,"In this study, colloidal gold (CG) and time-resolved fluorescent nanobead (TRFN) probes were used to establish an integrated immunochromatographic assay (ICA) to qualitatively and quantitatively detect clenbuterol (CLE). The best experimental conditions for the two probes in separate ICAs were obtained by optimizing the antibody labeling concentration, the amount of antigen, and the concentration of probe. When the CG and TRFN probes co-existed in the ICA, the latter had no effect on the sensitivity of qualitative detection of the CG probe-based ICA. However, the CG probe optimized the linear range of quantitative detection in the TRFN probe-based ICA. The integrated test strip can be used for qualitative and quantitative detection of CLE in one step. When the amount of antigen reached 0.4 mg/mL, the CG probe concentration reached 1.2 μg/mL, and the TRFN probe concentration reached 0.68 μg/mL. The qualitative sensitivity of the integrated ICA was 0.5 ng/mL and its quantitative limit of detection was 0.04 ng/mL with a detection range of 0.1-2.7 ng/mL.

Until recently, the pathophysiology of secondary lymphedema was thought to be related to impaired collateral lymphatic formation after surgical injury. However, more recent studies have shown that chronic inflammation-induced fibrosis plays a key role in the pathophysiology of this disease. In this review, we will discuss the evidence supporting this hypothesis and summarize recent publications demonstrating that lymphatic injury activates chronic immune responses that promote fibrosis and lymphatic leakiness, decrease collecting lymphatic pumping, and impair collateral lymphatic formation.

Reports proposed an additional non-canonical role of STAT3 that could regulate the activity of complexes I and II of the electron transport chain and the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP) after ischemia-reperfusion in various cell types. The native expression of STAT3 in heart mitochondria, together with a direct versus an indirect transcriptional role in mitochondrial functions, have been recently questioned. The objective of the present study was to investigate the cellular distribution of STAT3 in mouse adult cardiomyocytes under basal and stress conditions, along with assessing its presence and activity in cardiac mitochondria using structural and functional approaches. The analysis of the spatial distribution of STAT3 signal in the cardiomyocytes interestingly showed that it is transversely distributed along the T-tubules and in the nucleus. This distribution was neither affected by hypoxia nor by hypoxia/re‑oxygenation conditions. Focusing on the mitochondrial STAT3 localization, our results suggest that serine-phosphorylated STAT3 (PS727-STAT3) and total STAT3 are detected in crude but not in pure mitochondria of mouse adult cardiomyocytes, under basal and ischemia-reperfusion conditions. The inhibition of STAT3, with a pre-validated non-toxic Stattic dose, had no significant effects on mitochondrial respiration, but a weak effect on the calcium retention capacity. Overall, our results exclusively reveal a unique cellular distribution of STAT3 in mouse adult cardiomyocytes, along the T-tubules and in nucleus, under different conditions. They also challenge the expression and activity of STAT3 in mitochondria of these cells under basal conditions and following ischemia-reperfusion. In addition, our results underline technical methods, complemental to cell fractionation, to evaluate STAT3 roles during hypoxia-reoxygenation and at the interface between nucleus and endoplasmic reticulum.",Performance Assessment and Selection of Normalization Procedures for Single-Cell RNA-Seq.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022373,Cell systems,2019 06 10,"Systematic measurement biases make normalization an essential step in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis.

These services have not been standardized, and patients are vulnerable to receiving services that may appear legitimate but are not based on research evidence. The purpose of this clinical focus article is to promote standardization of tinnitus services by proposing an efficient clinical protocol for audiologists. Method The suggested clinical protocol is based primarily on research conducted at the National Center for Rehabilitative Auditory Research for the past 2 decades, with the focus on 2 randomized controlled trials completed recently that showed efficacy of an audiologic protocol involving hearing aids and brief tinnitus counseling. The protocol is mostly consistent with clinical practice guidelines that have been published.

Existing clinical practice guidelines for tinnitus are summarized with respect to their common recommendations for assessment and intervention. Conclusions A defined clinical protocol is suggested for audiologists, which includes a case history, appropriate referral, audiologic assessment, use of the Tinnitus and Hearing Survey ( Henry, Griest, et al., 2015 ), brief tinnitus counseling, hearing aids or combination instruments as warranted, follow-up assessment, and criteria for determining if further tinnitus-specific services are needed.

The goal of this study was to assess replicability of neural correlates of tinnitus, namely, resting-state functional connectivity, in the same individuals acquired over 2 sessions. Method Data were collected at 2 different sites (University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and Joint Base San Antonio Wilford Hall Ambulatory Surgical Center) using similar 3T magnets and similar data acquisition paradigms. Thirty-six patients (all civilians) were scanned using resting-state fMRI at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Ten patients, active-duty Service members and Veterans, were scanned at the Wilford Hall Ambulatory Surgical Center and the Department of Defense Hearing Center of Excellence. Each participant was scanned twice, a week apart, using identical protocols of 10 min resting-state fMRI. Results Tinnitus handicap scores using the Tinnitus Functional Index and the Tinnitus Primary Function Questionnaire ranged between no or mild handicap to moderately severe handicap but did not significantly differ between visits. We examined the default mode, dorsal attention, and auditory resting-state networks and found that the strength of the within-network functional connections across visit was similar for the attention and default mode networks but not for the auditory network. In addition, the functional connection between the attention network and precuneus, a region of the default mode network, was also replicable across visits. Conclusions Our results show that resting-state fMRI measures are replicable and reliable in patients with a subjective condition, although some networks and functional connections may be more stable than others. This paves the way for using resting-state fMRI to measure the efficacy of tinnitus interventions and as a tool to help propose better management options."

Ventilation-induced lung injury occurs as a result of epithelial stress and strain from atelectrauma and volutrauma, respectively, both of which occur in the setting of alveolar collapse. We suggest that ventilation-induced lung injury may be a unifying process explaining perpetuation of the fibrosis on the basis that (a) alveolar collapse has been repeatedly described in patients with pulmonary fibrosis, thereby providing a setting in which ventilation-induced lung injury can occur, and (b) patients with pulmonary fibrosis, many of the risk factors and genetic variants associated with pulmonary fibrosis as well as most of models used to study pulmonary fibrosis are all associated with surfactant abnormalities and/or with alveolar type 2 cell injury that would predispose to surfactant abnormalities, thereby increasing surface tension and causing alveolar collapse.

Upon ozonation, a decrease in DOM absorbance was observed in parallel with an increase in singlet oxygen (1O2) and fluorescence quantum yields (Φ1O2 and ΦF). The increase in Φ1O2 was attributed to the formation of quinone-like moieties during ozonation of the phenolic moieties of DOM, while the increase in ΦF can be explained by a significant decrease in the internal conversion rate of the first excited singlet state of the DOM (1DOM*). It is a consequence of an increase in the average energy of the first electronic transition (S1 → S0) that was assessed using the wavelength of maximum fluorescence emission (λF,max). Furthermore, ozonation did not affect the ratio of the apparent steady-state concentrations of excited triplet DOM (3DOM*) and 1O2, indicating that ozonation does not affect the efficiency of 1O2 production from 3DOM*. The consequences of these changes for the phototransformation rates of micropollutants in surface waters were examined using photochemical model calculations. The decrease in DOM absorbance caused by ozonation leads to an enhancement of direct photolysis rates due to the increased transparency of the water. Rates of indirect photooxidation induced by 1O2 and 3DOM* slightly decrease after ozonation.",Compensated Interferometry Measures of CYFRA 21-1 Improve Diagnosis of Lung Cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022347,ACS combinatorial science,2019 06 10,"Diagnosis of lung cancer patients with indeterminate pulmonary nodules (IPNs) presents a significant clinical challenge, with morbidity and management costs of $28 billion/year. We show that a quantitative free-solution assay (FSA), coupled with a compensated interferometric reader (CIR), improves the diagnostic performance of CYFRA 21-1 as a lung cancer biomarker. FSA-CIR is a rapid, mix-and-read, isothermal, label- and enzyme-free, matrix-insensitive, and target and probe-agnostic assay. Operating FSA-CIR at ∼40, 0.75 μL samples/day delivered a serum CYFRA 21-1 limit of quantification (LOQ) of 81 pg/mL with intra-assay and interassay CVs of 4.9% and 9.6% for four-day replicate determinations. Blinded analysis of a 225 patient cohort, consisting of 75 nonmalignant nodules, 45 adenocarcinomas, 44 squamous cell carcinomas, and 61 small cell lung cancers, gave a clear separation of cases and controls, not observed in the Cobas ECL analysis. The area under the curve (AUC) for the Mayo model increased from 0.595 to 0.923 when combined with the FSA-CIR CYFRA 21-1 measurements. In a population with nodules between 6 and 30 mm, the AUC increased from 0.567 to 0.943. In this subgroup, the positive predictive value (PPV) for all tumors by the CYFRA 21-1 assay was 98.7%. Our results demonstrate increased performance of the CYFRA 21-1 assay using FSA-CIR and represents a proof of concept for redefining the performance characteristics of this important candidate biomarker.","Reactivity, Selectivity, and Long-Term Performance of Sulfidized Nanoscale Zerovalent Iron with Different Properties.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022346,Environmental science & technology,2019 05 23,"Sulfidized nanoscale zerovalent iron (SNZVI) has desirable properties for in situ groundwater remediation. However, there is limited understanding of how the sulfidation type and particle properties affect the reactivity and selectivity of SNZVI toward groundwater contaminants, or how reactivity changes as the particles age. Here, SNZVI synthesized by either a one-step (SNZVI-1) or two-step (SNZVI-2) process were characterized, and the reactivity of both fresh and aged (1d to 60 d) nanoparticles was assessed. The measured S/Fe ratio was 5.4 ± 0.5 mol % for SNZVI-1 and 0.8 ± 0.1 mol % for SNZVI-2. XPS analysis indicates S2-, S22-, and S n2- species on the surface of both SNZVI-1 and SNZVI-2, while S22- is the dominant species inside of the SNZVI nanoparticles. SNZVI-1 particles were hydrophobic (contact angle = 103 ± 3°), while the other materials were hydrophilic (contact angles were 18 ± 2° and 36 ± 3° for NZVI and SNZVI-2, respectively). SNZVI-1, with greater S content and hydrophobicity, was less reactive with water than either NZVI or SNZVI-2 over a 60 d period, resulting in less H2 evolution. It also had the highest reactivity with TCE and the lowest reactivity with nitrate, consistent with its higher hydrophobicity. In contrast, both NZVI and SNZVI-2 were reactive with both TCE and nitrate. Both types of SNZVI remained more reactive after aging in water over 60 d than NZVI. These data suggest that the properties of the SNZVI made from a one-step synthesis procedure may provide better reactivity, selectivity, and longevity than that made from a two-step process.",Rechargeable Antibacterial N-Halamine Films with Antifouling Function for Food Packaging Applications.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022343,ACS applied materials & interfaces,2019 05 16,"Pathogenic microbial contamination from microbial adhesion and subsequent formation of the biofilm on surfaces of plastic food packaging materials, especially with robust resistance to antimicrobial agents, is a major reason for the outbreak of foodborne infections. Conventional strategies in controlling the contaminations are significantly limited either by biofouling or by the irreversible consumption of antimicrobial agents. Herein, we report a robust methodology to create rechargeable biocidal poly(vinyl alcohol- co-ethylene) films (SBMA@HAF films) with antifouling function via chemically incorporating both N-halamine (HAF) and zwitterionic moieties [[2-(methacryloyloxy)ethyl]dimethyl-(3-sulfopropyl)ammonium hydroxide (SBMA)]. The promise of the design exhibits three features to defeat bacterial contaminations: (i) zwitterionic moieties can effectively reduce bacterial attachment onto the films, (ii) N-halamine with robust rechargeable biocidal activity can rapidly kill any attached bacteria, and (iii) any inactivated bacterial debris can be easily released to avoid biofilm formation due to the superhydrophilicity of the zwitterions. The resulting SBMA@HAF films exhibit integrated properties of high transparency, robust mechanical property, great hydrophilicity, ease of chlorine recharging (>250 ppm), long-term stability, high biocidal efficacy (>99.9999% via contact killing), and promising antifouling functions, which enable the SBMA@HAF films to serve as a biocidal material in food packaging applications.",Hydrotrope-Driven Self-Assembly in CTAB/ n-Hexanol/Water/Heptane Reverse Micellar System.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022342,Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids,2019 05 23,"Self-organization of nanoparticles into one-dimensional (1D) nanochains leads to new unpredicted physiochemical properties, which are further exploited to develop photonic or electronic devices. Thus, the controlled fabrication of 1D nanochains requires nanotemplate, which acts as building blocks for the self-assembly of nanoparticles. To address this issue, we designed a hydrotrope (sodium salicylate)-based CTAB/ n-hexanol/water/heptane reverse micellar system. Hydrotrope, herein, modulates electrostatic interactions between reverse micellar droplets and paves the way for the formation of self-assembled structures. Small-angle X-ray scattering studies were performed on the CTAB/heptane reverse micellar system by varying hydrotrope concentrations and water-to-surfactant ratios (W x). The aqueous content of the reverse micellar pool is determined from the W x value, where W x = [H2O]/[CTAB] and [CTAB] = 0.05 M. SAXS studies were performed for CTAB/heptane reverse micellar systems at three different W x values, that is, 6, 12, and 16 and represented by W6, W12, and W16, respectively. All SAXS profiles were modeled with a spherical form factor and a Baxter sticky hard sphere structure factor. The interaction between droplets was predicted in terms of stickiness parameter. The effect of W x on the formation of self-assembled structures and forces governing the assembly has been discussed in detail. For the W6 system, the electrostatic repulsion between reverse micellar droplets decreases, resulting in the formation of the 1D chain-like assembly of nanodroplets. In the case of the W12 system, the dual feature of the hydrotrope has been observed, it increases the size of the reverse micellar system and reduces electrostatic repulsion between droplets because of which the formation of chain-like assemblies cannot be determined with accuracy. For the W16 system, the decrease in micellar size with the increase in the hydrotrope concentration has been observed. Thus, our reverse micellar templates may provide a comprehensive method for the fabrication of high aspect ratio 1D nanochains of a variety of materials and harnessing their collective properties for magnetic, catalytic, and opto-electronic applications.",Oriented Assembly of Cell-Mimicking Nanoparticles via a Molecular Affinity Strategy for Targeted Drug Delivery.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022341,ACS nano,2019 05 29,"Cell membrane cloaking is an emerging field in drug delivery in which specific functions of parent cells are conferred to newly formed biomimetic vehicles. A growing variety of delivery systems with diverse surface properties have been utilized for this strategy, but it is unclear whether the affinity of membrane-core pairs could guarantee effective and proper camouflaging. In this study, we propose a concise and effective ""molecular affinity"" strategy using the intracellular domain of transmembrane receptors as ""grippers"" during membrane coating. Red blood cell (RBC) membranes and cationic liposomes were adopted for fabrication, and a peptide ligand derived from the cytoplasmic protein P4.2 was prepared to specifically recognize the cytoplasmic domain of band 3, a key transmembrane receptor of erythrocytes. Once anchored onto the liposome surface, the P4.2-derived peptide would interact with the isolated RBC membrane, forming a ""hidden peptide button"", which ensures the right-side-out orientation. The membrane-coated liposomes exhibited an appropriate size distribution around 100 nm and high stability, with superior circulation durations compared with those of conventional PEGylated liposomes. Importantly, they possessed the ability to target Candida albicans by the interaction between the pathogenic fungus and host erythrocytes and to neutralize hemotoxin secreted by the pathogenic fungi. The curative effect of the model drug was thus substantially improved. In summary, the ""molecular affinity"" strategy may provide a powerful and universal approach for the construction of cell membrane-coated biomaterials and nanomedicines at both laboratory and industrial scales.","Discovery of Potent, Selective, and Short-Acting Peptidic V2 Receptor Agonists.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022340,Journal of medicinal chemistry,2019 05 23,"The vasopressin analogue desmopressin (desamino-d-arginine8 vasopressin, dDAVP, 1) is a potent vasopressin 2 (V2) receptor (V2R) agonist approved in many countries for the treatment of diabetes insipidus, primary nocturnal enuresis, nocturia, and coagulation disorders. Since 1 is primarily excreted via the kidneys, an age-related decline in kidney function leads to slower elimination, prolonged antidiuresis, and hyponatremia. In search of novel, potent, selective, and short-acting peptidic V2R agonists, we synthesized a series of C-terminally truncated analogues of [Val4]dDAVP, 2, modified in positions 2, 3, and 7 and/or at the disulfide bridge. The peptides were evaluated for in vitro potency at the human V2 receptor, selectivity versus the related receptors (human vasopressin 1a receptor, human vasopressin 1b receptor, and human oxytocin receptor), and pharmacokinetic profiles in rodents and other higher species. The truncated analogues show excellent potency at the V2R, increased systemic clearance, and shorter half-life in rats.

Development of novel genomic and genetic resources offers great potential to expand genetic diversity and improve important traits in watermelon. Here, we report a high-quality genome sequence of watermelon cultivar 'Charleston Gray', a principal American dessert watermelon, to complement the existing reference genome from '97103', an East Asian cultivar. Comparative analyses between genomes of 'Charleston Gray' and '97103' revealed genomic variants that may underlie phenotypic differences between the two cultivars. We then genotyped 1365 watermelon plant introduction (PI) lines maintained at the U.S. National Plant Germplasm System using genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS). These PI lines were collected throughout the world and belong to three Citrullus species, C. lanatus, C. mucosospermus and C. amarus. Approximately 25 000 high-quality single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were derived from the GBS data using the 'Charleston Gray' genome as the reference. Population genomic analyses using these SNPs discovered a close relationship between C. lanatus and C. mucosospermus and identified four major groups in these two species correlated to their geographic locations. Citrullus amarus was found to have a distinct genetic makeup compared to C. lanatus and C. mucosospermus. The SNPs also enabled identification of genomic regions associated with important fruit quality and disease resistance traits through genome-wide association studies.

Most engineering in plant species to date has relied heavily on the use of a few, well-established constitutive promoters to achieve high levels of expression; however, the levels of transgene expression can also be influenced by the use of codon optimization, intron-mediated enhancement and varying terminator sequences. Most of these alternative approaches for regulating transgene expression have only been tested in small-scale experiments, typically testing a single gene of interest. It is therefore difficult to interpret the relative importance of these approaches and to design engineering strategies that are likely to succeed in different plant species, particularly if engineering multigenic traits where the expression of each transgene needs to be precisely regulated. Here, we present data on the characterization of 46 promoters and 10 terminators in Medicago truncatula, Lotus japonicus, Nicotiana benthamiana and Hordeum vulgare, as well as the effects of codon optimization and intron-mediated enhancement on the expression of two transgenes in H. vulgare. We have identified a core set of promoters and terminators of relevance to researchers engineering novel traits in plant roots. In addition, we have shown that combining codon optimization and intron-mediated enhancement increases transgene expression and protein levels in barley. Based on our study, we recommend a core set of promoters and terminators for broad use and also propose a general set of principles and guidelines for those engineering cereal species.",Molecular detection and characterization of carnivore parvoviruses in free-ranging Eurasian otters (Lutra lutra) in southern Italy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022323,Transboundary and emerging diseases,2019 05 13,"The most important Italian population of the Eurasian otter (Lutra lutra) occurs in the southern part of the peninsula with two isolated sub-populations of about 250 adult individuals. The Eurasian otter is considered to be near threatened and it is a fully protected species. The aims of this study were to investigate for the first time the occurrence and characterize the parvoviruses included in the species Carnivore protoparvovirus 1 in seven carcasses of road-killed Eurasian otters from the southern Italy. Carnivore protoparvovirus 1 are responsible for acute gastroenteritis and leukopenia in pets and free-ranging carnivores. Initial screening of tissue samples by real-time PCR revealed CPV/FPV DNA in tissue samples of five Eurasian otters; three of them, showed co-infections by both CPV and FPV. Among the five positive Eurasian otters, we successfully obtained six DNA sequences from four individuals including two CPV-2a, one CPV-2b, one CPV-2c, and two FPV sequences. Comparison of these sequences with 250 VP2 gene sequences deposited in the GenBank database, showed 10 nt differences resulting in two synonymous and eight non-synonymous substitutions. On the basis of these results, two sequences here found were characterized as new CPV-2a, one was characterized as new CPV-2b variant, and one was characterized as FPV-like mutant. The last two sequences belong to a FPV and CPV-2c strain respectively. Carnivore protoparvovirus 1 is reported for the first time in the Eurasian otter showing high infection value in southern Italy. Occurrence of this infection should be studied further to understand its possible pathogenicity and virulence to the fragile and isolate Eurasian otter population which live in southern Italy.",Simultaneously inhibiting undecaprenyl phosphate production and peptidoglycan synthases promotes rapid lysis in Escherichia coli.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022322,Molecular microbiology,2019 05 07,"Peptidoglycan (PG) is a highly cross-linked polysaccharide that encases bacteria, resists the effects of turgor and confers cell shape. PG precursors are translocated across the cytoplasmic membrane by the lipid carrier undecaprenyl phosphate (Und-P) where they are incorporated into the PG superstructure. Previously, we found that one of our Escherichia coli laboratory strains (CS109) harbors a missense mutation in uppS, which encodes an enzymatically defective Und-P(P) synthase. Here, we show that CS109 cells lacking the bifunctional aPBP PBP1B (penicillin binding protein 1B) lyse during exponential growth at elevated temperature. PBP1B lysis was reversed by: (i) reintroducing wild-type uppS, (ii) increasing the availability of PG precursors or (iii) overproducing PBP1A, a related bifunctional PG synthase. In addition, inhibiting the catalytic activity of PBP2 or PBP3, two monofunctional bPBPs, caused CS109 cells to lyse. Limiting the precursors required for Und-P synthesis in MG1655, which harbors a wild-type allele of uppS, also promoted lysis in mutants lacking PBP1B or bPBP activity. Thus, simultaneous inhibition of Und-P production and PG synthases provokes a synergistic response that leads to cell lysis. These findings suggest a biological connection that could be exploited in combination therapies.",Systemic resilience to cross-border infectious disease threat events in Europe.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022321,Transboundary and emerging diseases,2019 05 17,"Recurrent health emergencies threaten global health security. International Health Regulations (IHR) aim to prevent, detect and respond to such threats, through increase in national public health core capacities, but whether IHR core capacity implementation is necessary and sufficient has been contested. With a longitudinal study we relate changes in national IHR core capacities to changes in cross-border infectious disease threat events (IDTE) between 2010 and 2016, collected through epidemic intelligence at the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). By combining all IHR core capacities into one composite measure we found that a 10% increase in the mean of this composite IHR core capacity to be associated with a 19% decrease (p = 0.017) in the incidence of cross-border IDTE in the EU. With respect to specific IHR core capacities, an individual increase in national legislation, policy & financing; coordination and communication with relevant sectors; surveillance; response; preparedness; risk communication; human resource capacity; or laboratory capacity was associated with a significant decrease in cross-border IDTE incidence. In contrast, our analysis showed that IHR core capacities relating to point-of-entry, zoonotic events or food safety were not associated with IDTE in the EU. Due to high internal correlations between core capacities, we conducted a principal component analysis which confirmed a 20% decrease in risk of IDTE for every 10% increase in the core capacity score (95% CI: 0.73, 0.88). Globally (EU excluded), a 10% increase in the mean of all IHR core capacities combined was associated with a 14% decrease (p = 0.077) in cross-border IDTE incidence. We provide quantitative evidence that improvements in IHR core capacities at country-level are associated with fewer cross-border IDTE in the EU, which may also hold true for other parts of the world.",Advances in Porous Organic Polymers for Efficient Water Capture.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022320,"Chemistry (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)",2019 06 14,"Desiccant driven dehumidification for maintaining the proper humidity levels and atmospheric water capture with minimum energy penalty are important aspects in heat pumps, refrigeration, gas and liquid purifications, gas sensing, and clean water production for improved human health and comfort.

Enormous resources have been devoted to establishing structural and functional brain connectivity networks that can be used to define spatially distributed yet related groups of voxels. We propose using the fused sparse group lasso penalty to encourage structured, sparse, and interpretable solutions by incorporating prior information about spatial and group structure among voxels. We present optimization steps for fused sparse group lasso penalized regression using the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm.

More recently, many studies have used another set of unbiased approaches, proteomics, to query the function of familial PD genes in a variety of contexts. We will discuss some specific examples, including; elucidation of protein-protein interaction networks for two dominantly inherited genes, α-synuclein and leucine rich-repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2); the identification of substrates for three genes for familial PD that are also enzymes, namely LRRK2, pink1 and parkin; and changes in protein abundance that arise downstream to introduction of mutations associated with familial PD.

Yet, studies conducted in most malaria transmission zones report the absence of gametocyte in the majority of patients. We therefore sought to determine the risk factors of both all-stage and mature gametocyte carriage in an area with high stable transmission of Plasmodium falciparum in Cameroon. Gametocyte positivity was determined using three complementary methods: thick blood smear microscopy, RT-PCR and RT-LAMP, whereas exposure to the infection was assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Of 361 malaria endemic residents randomly included in the study (mean age: 28±23 years, age range: 2-100 years, male/female sex ratio: 1.1), 87.8% were diagnosed with P. falciparum infection, of whom 45.7% presented with fever (axillary body temperature ≥37.5°C). Mature gametocyte positivity was 1.9% by thick blood smear microscopy and 8.9% by RT-PCR targeting the mature gametocyte transcript, Pfs25. The gametocyte positivity rate was 24.1% and 36.3% by RT-PCR or RT-LAMP, respectively, when targeting the sexual stage marker, Pfs16. Multivariate analyses revealed anemia as a common independent risk factor for both mature and all-stage gametocyte carriage, whereas fever and low anti-gametocyte antibody levels were independently associated with all-stage gametocyte carriage only. Taken together, the data suggest important differences in risk factors of gametocyte carriage depending on stage analyzed, with anemia, fever and low antiplasmodial plasma antibody levels representing the major contributing risk factors.",Cell-cell fusion induced by reovirus FAST proteins enhances replication and pathogenicity of non-enveloped dsRNA viruses.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022290,PLoS pathogens,2019 05 10,"Fusogenic reoviruses encode fusion-associated small transmembrane (FAST) protein, which induces cell-cell fusion. FAST protein is the only known fusogenic protein in non-enveloped viruses, and its role in virus replication is not yet known. We generated replication-competent, FAST protein-deficient pteropine orthoreovirus and demonstrated that FAST protein was not essential for viral replication, but enhanced viral replication in the early phase of infection. Addition of recombinant FAST protein enhanced replication of FAST-deficient virus and other non-fusogenic viruses in a fusion-dependent and FAST-species-independent manner. In a mouse model, replication and pathogenicity of FAST-deficient virus were severely impaired relative to wild-type virus, indicating that FAST protein is a major determinant of the high pathogenicity of fusogenic reovirus. FAST-deficient virus also conferred effective protection against challenge with lethal homologous virus strains in mice. Our results demonstrate a novel role of a viral fusogenic protein and the existence of a cell-cell fusion-dependent replication system in non-enveloped viruses."

Although the impact of the variation of cell subtype composition on measured genomic quantities is recognized, and some innovative tools have been developed for the analysis of heterogeneous samples, most functional genomics studies using samples with mixed cell types still ignore the influence of cell subtype proportion variation, or just deal with it as a nuisance variable to be eliminated. Here we demonstrate how harvesting information about cell subtype proportions from functional genomics data can provide insights into cellular changes associated with phenotypes. We focused on two types of mixed cell populations, human blood and mouse kidney. Cell type prediction is well developed in the former, but not currently in the latter. Estimating the cellular repertoire is easier when a reference dataset from purified samples of all cell types in the tissue is available, as is the case for blood. However, reference datasets are not available for most other tissues, such as the kidney. In this study, we showed that the proportion of alterations attributable to changes in the cellular composition varies strikingly in the two disorders (asthma and systemic lupus erythematosus), suggesting that the contribution of cell subtype proportion changes to functional genomic properties can be disease-specific. We also showed that a reference dataset from a single-cell RNA-seq study successfully estimated the cell subtype proportions in mouse kidney and allowed us to distinguish altered cell subtype differences between two different knock-out mouse models, both of which had reported a reduced number of glomeruli compared to their wild-type counterparts. These findings demonstrate that testing for changes in cell subtype proportions between conditions can yield important insights in functional genomics studies.",Efficacy of cefquinome and a combination of cloxacillin and ampicillin for treatment of dairy cows with Streptococcus agalactiae subclinical mastitis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022270,PloS one,2019 05 10,"A randomized clinical trial was conducted to assess efficacy of intramammary cloxacillin and ampicillin (CLOXIMM), intramammary cefquinome (CEFIMM), and intramuscular cefquinome (CEFIM) to treat Streptococcus agalactiae intramammary infections (Trial 1). Subsequently, two treatment groups were extended to assess whether CLOXIMM was not inferior to CEFIMM (Trial 2). Nine farms were included in the study. Milk samples were collected from all quarters of all lactating cows for microbiological identification of S. agalactiae. Positive cows were randomly allocated into four groups: CLOXIMM, CEFIMM, CEFIM, or negative control (CONTROL). Study outcomes were bacteriological cure at 14 (CURE14), 21 (CURE21), and 14 and 21 (CURE1421) days after treatment onset, and somatic cell count. Logistic regression was used to estimate the odds of cure between each treatment and CONTROL. Non-inferiority analysis was performed considering a one-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) and non-inferiority margins (Δ) of 0.10, 0.15, 0.20, and 0.25. Adjusted S. agalactiae bacteriological cure for CLOXIMM, CEFIMM, CEFIM, and CONTROL was 86, 98, 55, and 25% at day 14; 82, 93, 52, and 0% at day 21; and 82, 92, 40, and 0% at days 14 and 21, respectively. Treatment with CLOXIMM and CEFIMM resulted in greater bacteriological cure rates, as compared with CEFIM or CONTROL, which does not justify the use of CEFIM in S. agalactiae eradication programs. The CURE14 difference between CEFIMM and CLOXIMM was of 12.1 percentage points (95% CI: 0.056-0.184). CLOXIMM was considered not inferior to CEFIMM for Δ = 0.20 or 0.25 and inconclusive for Δ = 0.10 or 0.15. Thus, it should be pondered by veterinarians whether an expected 12.1 (5.6-18.4) percentage points increase in cure rate would justify the use of a fourth-generation cephalosporin, as opposed to a combination of traditional IMM drugs (cloxacillin and ampicillin) to treat S. agalactiae subclinical mastitis.",A negative role for the interleukin-2-inducible T-cell kinase (ITK) in human Foxp3+ TREG differentiation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022269,PloS one,2019 05 10,"The Tec kinases ITK (interleukin-2-inducible T-cell kinase) and RLK (resting lymphocyte kinase) are critical components of the proximal TCR/CD3 signal transduction machinery, and data in mice suggest that ITK negatively modulates regulatory T cell (TREG) differentiation. However, whether Tec kinases modulate TREG development and/or function in human T cells remains unknown. Using a novel self-delivery siRNA platform (sdRNA), we found that ITK knockdown in human primary naïve peripheral blood CD4 T cells increased Foxp3+ expression under both TREG and T helper priming conditions. TREG differentiated under ITK knockdown conditions exhibited enhanced expression of the co-inhibitory receptor PD-1 and were suppressive in a T cell proliferation assay. ITK knockdown decreased IL-17A production in T cells primed under Th17 conditions and promoted Th1 differentiation. Lastly, a dual ITK/RLK Tec kinase inhibitor did not induce Foxp3 in CD4 T cells, but conversely abrogated Foxp3 expression induced by ITK knockdown. Our data suggest that targeting ITK in human T cells may be an effective approach to boost TREG in the context of autoimmune diseases, but concomitant inhibition of other Tec family kinases may negate this effect.",Is remaining intervertebral disc tissue interfering with bone generation during fusion of two vertebrae?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022268,PloS one,2019 05 10,laboratory research.,Low-normal hemoglobin levels and anemia are associated with increased risk of end-stage renal disease in general populations: A prospective cohort study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022266,PloS one,2019 05 10,The impact of low-normal hemoglobin (Hb) levels and anemia on the risk of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in general populations has rarely been examined.,Effect of proton pump inhibitors on mortality of cirrhotic patients with pneumonia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022265,PloS one,2019 05 10,"Pneumonia is life-threatening in patients with liver cirrhosis.

It is a framed field experiment that follows the steps of a previous observational study of investor behavior in the Finnish stock market. Our experimental approach has an edge over the observational study in that it can control extraneous variables and two or more groups can be compared. We consider in particular the groups of amateur students and professional investors because it is well established in the literature that the disposition effect is less pronounced in professionals. The disposition effect was measured by both the traditional metric and a broader one that properly considers return intervals. A full logit model with control variables was employed in the latter case. As a result, we replicate for the broader definition what already has been found for the traditional measure: that investor experience dampens the disposition effect. Trades with positive returns exhibited higher propensity to sell than trades with negative returns. For the overall sample of participants, we find the disposition effect cannot be explained by prospect theory, but we cast doubt on this stance from partitions of data from amateurs and professionals.",RNA-sequencing analysis reveals betalains metabolism in the leaf of Amaranthus tricolor L.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022263,PloS one,2019 05 10,"Amaranth plants contain large amounts of betalains, including betaxanthins and betacyanins. Amaranthin is a betacyanin, and its molecular structure and associated metabolic pathway differ from those of betanin in beet plants. The chlorophyll, carotenoid, betalain, and flavonoid contents in amaranth leaves were analyzed. The abundance of betalain, betacyanin, and betaxanthin was 2-5-fold higher in the red leaf sectors than in the green leaf sectors. Moreover, a transcriptome database was constructed for the red and green sectors of amaranth leaves harvested from 30-day-old seedlings. 22 unigenes were selected to analyze the expression profiles in the two leaf sectors. The RNA-sequencing data indicated that many unigenes are involved in betalain metabolic pathways. The potential relationships between diverse metabolic pathways and betalain metabolism were analyzed. The validation of the expression of 22 selected unigenes in a qRT-PCR assay revealed the genes that were differentially expressed in the two leaf sectors. Betalains were biosynthesized in specific tissues of the red sectors of amaranth leaves. Almost all of the genes related to betalain metabolism were identified in the transcriptome database, and the expression profiles were different between the red sectors and green sectors in the leaf. Amaranth plants consist of diverse metabolic pathways, and the betalain metabolic pathway is linked to a group of other metabolic pathways.",Academic outcomes following adolescent sport-related concussion or fracture injury: A prospective cohort study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022262,PloS one,2019 05 10,The objectives were 1) to compare the effects of adolescent sport-related concussion (SRC) and sport-related extremity fracture (SRF) on academic outcomes including change in school grades and school attendance; and 2) to determine which specific academic accommodations were most helpful during recovery from these injuries.,Selection signatures in four German warmblood horse breeds: Tracing breeding history in the modern sport horse.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022261,PloS one,2019 05 10,"The study of selection signatures helps to find genomic regions that have been under selective pressure and might host genes or variants that modulate important phenotypes. Such knowledge improves our understanding of how breeding programmes have shaped the genomes of livestock. In this study, 942 stallions were included from four, exemplarily chosen, German warmblood breeds with divergent historical and recent selection focus and different crossbreeding policies: Trakehner (N = 44), Holsteiner (N = 358), Hanoverian (N = 319) and Oldenburger (N = 221). Those breeds are nowadays bred for athletic performance and aptitude for show-jumping, dressage or eventing, with a particular focus of Holsteiner on the first discipline. Blood samples were collected during the health exams of the stallion preselections before licensing and were genotyped with the Illumina EquineSNP50 BeadChip. Autosomal markers were used for a multi-method search for signals of positive selection. Analyses within and across breeds were conducted by using the integrated Haplotype Score (iHS), cross-population Extended Haplotype Homozygosity (xpEHH) and Runs of Homozygosity (ROH). Oldenburger and Hanoverian showed very similar iHS signatures, but breed specificities were detected on multiple chromosomes with the xpEHH. The Trakehner clustered as a distinct group in a principal component analysis and also showed the highest number of ROHs, which reflects their historical bottleneck. Beside breed specific differences, we found shared selection signals in an across breed iHS analysis on chromosomes 1, 4 and 7. After investigation of these iHS signals and shared ROH for potential functional candidate genes and affected pathways including enrichment analyses, we suggest that genes affecting muscle functionality (TPM1, TMOD2-3, MYO5A, MYO5C), energy metabolism and growth (AEBP1, RALGAPA2, IGFBP1, IGFBP3-4), embryonic development (HOXB-complex) and fertility (THEGL, ZPBP1-2, TEX14, ZP1, SUN3 and CFAP61) have been targeted by selection in all breeds. Our findings also indicate selection pressure on KITLG, which is well-documented for influencing pigmentation."

In most cases, the application of such systems enables regulating the expression of an entire group of genes in response to any internal signal such as an aerobic/anaerobic switch, a transition to stationary phase, or the exhausting of essential compounds. In this work, we demonstrate an example of another type of artificial autoinducible module, denoted a positive feedback module. This positive feedback module generates an inducer molecule that in turn enhances its own synthesis, promoting an activation signal. Due to the use of acetolactate, an intermediate of the L-valine biosynthetic pathway, as a specific inducer molecule, we realized a positive feedback loop in the biosynthetic pathway of branched chain amino acids. Such positive feedback was demonstrated to improve the production of a target compound.",Calibration and evaluation of Quigley's hybrid housing price model in Microsoft Excel.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022248,PloS one,2019 05 10,"Quigley derived his hybrid price model to improve the precision of predicted prices of sold homes by statistically merging data of resold homes in a repeat sales model with that of once-sold homes in a single sales hedonic price model. The literature has few applications of the hybrid model aside from those by Quigley and his collaborators. Two reasons for this underuse may be its computational intensiveness and its marginal empirical improvement in comparison with two other models. This paper first demystifies this computational intensiveness by calibrating models in Microsoft Excel with transferable procedures into other software. It second evaluates the hybrid price model's empirical improvement as a reason for its underuse by predicting prices of 2,559 sold and resold homes observed in two inner-city neighbourhoods in Windsor, Ontario, during a 30-year period. The results as hypothesized are its lower standard errors of regression coefficients and higher simple R-squared than those of a single sales hedonic price model. Moreover, the hybrid model's predictions have higher correlations than those of the single sales model with not only in-sample observed prices or changes in prices but also out-of-sample ones. The conclusion speculates in plans for future research about reasons for two models' similar or dissimilar regression coefficients and standard errors predicting correspondingly similar or dissimilar sale prices of homes through time.",Ontogenetic changes in the long bone microstructure in the nine-banded armadillo (Dasypus novemcinctus).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022247,PloS one,2019 05 10,"Analysis of ontogenetic changes in long bone microstructure aid in vertebrate life history reconstructions. Specifically, osteohistological examination of common fauna can be used to infer growth strategies of biologically uncommon, threatened, or extinct vertebrates. Although nine-banded armadillo biology has been studied extensively, work on growth history is limited. Here we describe long bone microstructure in tibiae and femora of a limited ontogenetic series of nine- banded armadillos (Dasypus novemcinctus) to elucidate patterns of bone growth. The cortex of the smallest individual is composed of compacted coarse cancellous bone (CCCB) and woven tissue. Extensive cortical drift is driven by periosteal erosion and further compaction of trabeculae resulting in an increase in the amount of CCCB. The cortex of the largest specimens is primarily CCCB with thickened endosteal bone and thin outer cortices of lamellar and parallel-fibered tissue. The outer cortices of the largest individuals are interpreted as an external fundamental system (EFS) indicating a cessation of appositional bone growth corresponding to skeletal maturity (i.e. asymptotic or adult size). The EFS forms in femora prior to tibiae, indicating femoral growth rates begin decreasing earlier than tibial in D. novemcinctus. Growth trends in common fauna like the nine-banded armadillo can be used as a foundation for understanding life histories of related, but uncommon or extinct, species of cingulates.",Aerobic exercise training prevents obesity and insulin resistance independent of the renin angiotensin system modulation in the subcutaneous white adipose tissue.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022246,PloS one,2019 05 10,"We investigate the effects of aerobic exercise training (AET) on the thermogenic response, substrate metabolism and renin angiotensin system (RAS) in the subcutaneous white adipose tissue (SC-WAT) of mice fed cafeteria diet (CAF). Male C57BL/6J mice were assigned into groups CHOW-SED (chow diet, sedentary; n = 10), CHOW-TR (chow diet, trained; n = 10), CAF-SED (CAF, sedentary; n = 10) and CAF-TR (CAF, trained; n = 10). AET consisted in running sessions of 60 min at 60% of maximal speed, five days per week for eight weeks. The CAF-SED group showed higher body weight and adiposity, glucose intolerance and insulin resistance (IR), while AET prevented such damages in CAF-TR group. AET reduced the p-AKT/t-AKT ratio and increased ATGL expression in CHOW-TR and CAF-TR groups and increased t-HSL and p-HSL/t-HSL ratio in CAF-TR. AET prevented adipocyte hypertrophy in CAF-TR group and increased UCP-1 protein expression only in CHOW-TR. Serum ACE2 increased in CHOW-TR and CAF-TR groups, and Ang (1-7) increased in the CHOW-TR group. In the SC-WAT, CAF-TR group increased the expression of AT1, AT2 and Mas receptors, whereas CHOW-TR increased Ang (1-7) and Ang (1-7)/Ang II ratio in SC-WAT. No changes were observed in ACE and Ang II. Positive correlations were observed between UCP-1 and kITT (r = 0.6), between UCP-1 and Ang (1-7) concentration (r = 0.6), and between UCP-1 and Ang (1-7)/Ang II ratio (r = 0.7). In conclusion, the AET prevented obesity and IR, reduced insulin signaling proteins and increased lipolysis signaling proteins in the SC-WAT. In addition, the CAF diet precludes the AET-induced thermogenic response and the partial modulation of the RAS suggests that the protective effect of AET against obesity and IR could not be associated with SC-WAT RAS.",Towards interpretable machine learning models for diagnosis aid: A case study on attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022245,PloS one,2019 05 10,"Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that has heavy consequences on a child's wellbeing, especially in the academic, psychological and relational planes. The current evaluation of the disorder is supported by clinical assessment and written tests. A definitive diagnosis is usually made based on the DSM-V criteria. There is a lot of ongoing research on ADHD, in order to determine the neurophysiological basis of the disorder and to reach a more objective diagnosis. The advent of Machine Learning (ML) opens up promising prospects for the development of systems able to predict a diagnosis from phenotypic and neuroimaging data. This was the reason why the ADHD-200 contest was launched a few years ago. Based on the publicly available ADHD-200 collection, participants were challenged to predict ADHD with the best possible predictive accuracy. In the present work, we propose instead a ML methodology which primarily places importance on the explanatory power of a model. Such an approach is intended to achieve a fair trade-off between the needs of performance and interpretability expected from medical diagnosis aid systems. We applied our methodology on a data sample extracted from the ADHD-200 collection, through the development of decision trees which are valued for their readability. Our analysis indicates the relevance of the limbic system for the diagnosis of the disorder. Moreover, while providing explanations that make sense, the resulting decision tree performs favorably given the recent results reported in the literature.","Cephalometric studies of the mandible, its masticatory muscles and vasculature of growing Göttingen Minipigs-A comparative anatomical study to refine experimental mandibular surgery.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022244,PloS one,2019 05 10,"Over many decades, the Göttingen Minipig has been used as a large animal model in experimental surgical research of the mandible. Recently several authors have raised concerns over the use of the Göttingen Minipig in this research area, observing problems with post-operative wound healing and loosening implants. To reduce these complications during and after surgery and to improve animal welfare in mandibular surgery research, the present study elucidated how comparable the mandible of minipigs is to that of humans and whether these complications could be caused by specific anatomical characteristics of the minipigs' mandible, its masticatory muscles and associated vasculature. Twenty-two mandibular cephalometric parameters were measured on CT scans of Göttingen Minipigs aged between 12 and 21 months. Ultimately, we compared this data with human data reported in the scientific literature. In addition, image segmentation was used to determine the masticatory muscle morphology and the configuration of the mandibular blood vessels. Compared to data of humans, significant differences in the mandibular anatomy of minipigs were found. Of the 22 parameters measured only four were found to be highly comparable, whilst the others were not. The 3D examinations of the minipigs vasculature showed a very prominent deep facial vein directly medial to the mandibular ramus and potentially interfering with the sectional plane of mandibular distraction osteogenesis. Damage to this vessel could result in inaccessible bleeding. The findings of this study suggest that Göttingen Minipigs are not ideal animal models for experimental mandibular surgery research. Nevertheless if these minipigs are used the authors recommend that radiographic techniques, such as computed tomography, be used in the specific planning procedures for the mandibular surgical experiments. In addition, it is advisable to choose suitable age groups and customize implants based on the mandibular dimensions reported in this study.",The performance of pre-delivery serum concentrations of angiogenic factors in predicting postpartum antihypertensive drug therapy following abdominal delivery in severe preeclampsia and normotensive pregnancy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022243,PloS one,2019 05 10,The imbalance between circulating concentrations of anti- and pro-angiogenic factors is usually intense in preeclampsia with severe features (sPE).

Most aftershock and clustering earthquake sequences do not recur on the main seismogenic fault but are controlled by fault interactions with adjacent seismic structures. Four groups of conceptual models were generated in this study to determine how the geometry of the seismogenic faults controls the distributions of stress fields and earthquakes. The influences of the fault length ratio, center distance, overlap ratio, echelon distance and fault opening angle were considered in a 2D viscoelastic model. The results indicate that the interaction in the slipping zone is larger when collinear interacting faults are more closely positioned, with one fault lengthening. For noncollinear faults, the interaction is stronger as the inner tips pass each other, which impedes their growth after some degree of overlap. Additionally, fault interaction at the slipping zone becomes stronger as the opening angle approaches 180°. We further generated a 3D viscoelastic model of fault interactions in Central North China Block and applied the finite element method to analyze the relationship between distributions of earthquakes and fault geometry. The calculated results reveal well-matched higher stress and maximum shear strain concentrations in the southern part of the Fen-wei Graben Zone than in other zones in Central North China Block, which can be explained by the longer faults, shorter center distances, shorter overlap lengths and larger opening angles. The stress distributions and fault interactions should be considered in long-term seismic hazard assessment in these zones."

Throughout its distribution the species has exhibited pronounced declines and is widely considered threatened. Conservation efforts may be hindered by the lack of population genetic data and understanding of the spatial scale of population connectivity. To address this knowledge gap this research details the first broad scale phylogeographic study of L. cervus based on mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequencing and microsatellite analysis of samples collected from 121 localities across Europe. Genetic data were complemented by palaeo-distribution models of spatial occupancy during the Last Glacial Maximum to strengthen inferences of refugial areas. A salient feature of the mtDNA was the identification of two lineages. Lineage I was widespread across Europe while lineage II was confined to Greece. Microsatellites supported the differentiation of the Greek samples and alongside palaeo-distribution models indicated this area was a glacial refuge. The genetic endemism of the Greek samples, and demographic results compatible with no signatures of spatial expansion likely reflects restricted dispersal into and out of the area. Lineage I exhibited a shallow star like phylogeny compatible with rapid population expansion across Europe. Demographic analysis indicated such expansions occurred after the Last Glacial Maximum. Nuclear diversity and hindcast species distribution models indicated a central Italian refuge for lineage I. Palaeo-distribution modelling results also suggested a western refuge in northern Iberia and south-west France. In conclusion the results provide evidence of glacial divergence in stag beetle while also suggesting high, at least on evolutionary timescales, gene flow across most of Europe. The data also provide a neutral genetic framework against which patterns of phenotypic variation may be assessed.",Risk factors of neonatal sepsis in India: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022223,PloS one,2019 05 10,The incidence of neonatal sepsis in India is the highest in the world.

However, there is little information in the literature on the longitudinal stability of these widely used biomarkers. In a large clinical trial involving 10 institutional sites, smokers were given, free of charge over a period of 20 weeks, Spectrum NRC600/601 research cigarettes containing 15.5 mg nicotine/g tobacco. All participants were instructed to smoke these cigarettes for the duration of the study. At weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20, first morning urine voids were collected and analyzed for 8-iso-PGF2α and PGE-M using validated liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry methods. The mean level of 8-iso-PGF2α at Week 4 was 1.34 ± 1.08 (S.D.) pmol/mg creatinine (N = 226) while that of PGE-M was 73.7 ± 113 (S.D.) pmol/mg creatinine (N = 232). The corresponding levels at Week 20 were 1.35 ± 0.93 (S.D.) pmol/mg creatinine (N = 209) for 8-iso-PGF2α and 74.2 ± 142 (S.D.) pmol/mg creatinine (N = 210) for PGE-M. There was variation in these values in the intervening weeks. The intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC) were 0.51 (95% CI, 0.45, 0.57) and 0.36 (0.30, 0.43), for 8-iso-PGF2α and PGE-M, respectively, indicating fair longitudinal stability for 8-iso-PGF2α and poorer longitudinal stability for PGE-M in cigarette smokers. Males had higher ICC values than females for both 8-iso-PGF2α and PGE-M. These results indicate that, in addition to cigarette smoking, endogenous processes of oxidative damage and inflammation influence the levels of these biomarkers over time among current smokers."

We analyze the accuracy and precision of the estimators using extreme value theory, as well as through simulations of the sampling distributions. For the exponential distribution, the estimator of the mean is unbiased and its variance decreases as either m or n increases. Likewise, for the normal distribution, we show that the estimator of the mean has negligible bias and the estimator of the variance is unbiased. While the variance of the estimators for the normal distribution decreases as m, the number of sample maxima, increases, the variance increases as n, the sample size over which the maximum is computed, increases.

The expression levels of the enterotoxin genes hblA, hblD, nheA, nheB and nheC, determined by means of RT real-time PCR in B. toyonensis, were lower than those in B. cereus reference strains. No expression of hblC was detected. The Western blot assays of native and 25-fold concentrated supernatants from B. toyonensis, using monoclonal antibodies directed against the Hbl component L1 and the Nhe component NheB, showed weak bands. The NheC component was not detected in the native supernatant, but weakly in the 25-fold concentrated supernatant. According to the results of the present study, the enterotoxin expression and protein levels of B. toyonensis BCT-7112T were absent or clearly lower compared to the B. cereus reference strains. Thus, their ability to form functional enterotoxins can also be considered to be lower or unlikely compared to the B. cereus reference strains.

Physiological degeneration and disease onset are common occurrences in the aging population. iPSCs could offer regenerative medical options for age-related degeneration and disease in the elderly. However, reprogramming somatic cells from the elderly is inefficient when successful at all. Perhaps due to their low rates of replication in culture, traditional transduction and reprogramming approaches with centenarian fibroblasts met with little success. A simple and reproducible reprogramming process is reported here which enhances interactions of the cells with the viral vectors that leads to improved iPSC generation. The improved methods efficiently generates fully reprogrammed iPSC lines from 105-107 years old subjects in feeder-free conditions using an episomal, Sendai-Virus (SeV) reprogramming vector expressing four reprogramming factors. In conclusion, dermal fibroblasts from human subjects older than 100 years can be efficiently and reproducibly reprogrammed to fully pluripotent cells with minor modifications to the standard reprogramming procedures. Efficient generation of iPSCs from the elderly may provide a source of cells for the regeneration of tissues and organs with autologous cells as well as cellular models for the study of aging, longevity and age-related diseases.",Low genetic heterogeneity of copy number variations (CNVs) in the genes encoding the human deoxyribonucleases 1-like 3 and II potentially relevant to autoimmunity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022206,PloS one,2019 05 10,"Deoxyribonucleases (DNases) might play a role in prevention of autoimmune conditions such as systemic lupus erythematosus through clearance of cell debris resulting from apoptosis and/or necrosis. Previous studies have suggested that variations in the in vivo activities of DNases I-like 3(1L3) and II have an impact on autoimmune-related conditions. The genes for these DNases are known to show copy number variations (CNVs) whereby copy loss leads to a reduction of the in vivo activities of the enzymes, thereby possibly affecting the pathophysiological background of autoimmune diseases. Using a simple newly developed quantitative real-time PCR method, we investigated the distributions of the CNVs for DNASE1L3 and DNASE2 in Japanese and German populations. It was found that only 2 diploid copy numbers for all of these DNASE CNVs was distributed in both of the study populations; no copy loss or gain was evident for any of the autoimmune-related DNase genes. Therefore, it was demonstrated that these human autoimmune-related DNase genes show low genetic diversity of CNVs resulting in alterations of the in vivo levels of DNase activity.",Specific interaction of zinc finger protein Com with RNA and the crystal structure of a self-complementary RNA duplex recognized by Com.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022205,PloS one,2019 05 10,"The bacteriophage Mu Com is a small zinc finger protein that binds to its cognate mom mRNA and activates its translation. The Mom protein, in turn, elicits a chemical modification (momification) of the bacteriophage genome, rendering the DNA resistant to cleavage by bacterial restriction endonucleases, and thereby protecting it from defense mechanisms of the host. We examined the basis of specificity in Com-RNA interactions by in vitro selection and probing of RNA structure. We demonstrated that Com recognizes a sequence motif within a hairpin-loop structure of its target RNA. Our data support the model of Com interaction with mom mRNA, in which Com binds to the short hairpin structure proximal to the so-called translation inhibition structure. We also observed that Com binds its target motif weakly if it is within an RNA duplex. These results suggest that the RNA structure, in addition to its sequence, is crucial for Com to recognize its target and that RNA conformational changes may constitute another level of Mom regulation. We determined a crystal structure of a Com binding site variant designed to form an RNA duplex preferentially. Our crystal model forms a 19-mer self-complementary double helix composed of the canonical and non-canonical base pairs. The helical parameters of crystalized RNA indicate why Com may bind it more weakly than a monomeric hairpin form.",Corneal biomechanical alterations in patients with chronic ocular Graft Versus-Host Disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022204,PloS one,2019 05 10,"To compare corneal biomechanics between patients with ocular graft versus-host disease (oGVHD) and healthy subjects (controls), and to further correlate these values with ocular and hematological characteristics.",Pyridine as an additive to improve the deposition of continuous electrospun filaments.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022203,PloS one,2019 05 10,"Electrospun filaments are leading to a new generation of medical yarns that have the ability to enhance tissue healing through their biophysical cues.

We have added pyridine to polydioxanone solutions at concentrations ranging from 0 to 100 ppm, increasing the conductivity of the solutions almost linearly from 0.04 uS/cm to 7 uS/cm. Following electrospinning, this led to deposition length increasing from 1 cm to 14 cm. The samples containing pyridine easily underwent cold drawing. The strength of drawn filaments increased from 0.8 N to 1.5 N and this corresponded to a decrease in fibre diameter, with values dropping from 2.7 μm to 1 μm.

In contrast, little is known about microbial community structure and activity in the hypoxic zone despite the implication that microbial respiration is responsible for forming low dissolved oxygen (DO) conditions. Here, we hypothesized that the extent of the hypoxic zone is a driver in determining microbial community structure, and in particular, the abundance of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA). Samples collected across the shelf for two consecutive hypoxic seasons in July 2013 and 2014 were analyzed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, oligotyping, microbial co-occurrence analysis, and quantification of thaumarchaeal 16S rRNA and archaeal ammonia-monooxygenase (amoA) genes. In 2014 Thaumarchaeota were enriched and inversely correlated with DO while Cyanobacteria, Acidimicrobiia, and Proteobacteria where more abundant in oxic samples compared to hypoxic. Oligotyping analysis of Nitrosopumilus 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that one oligotype was significantly inversely correlated with DO in both years. Oligotyping analysis revealed single nucleotide variation among all Nitrosopumilaceae, including Nitrosopumilus 16S rRNA gene sequences, with one oligotype possibly being better adapted to hypoxia. We further provide evidence that in the hypoxic zone of both year 2013 and 2014, low DO concentrations and high Thaumarchaeota abundances influenced microbial co-occurrence patterns. Taken together, the data demonstrated that the extent of hypoxic conditions could potentially drive patterns in microbial community structure, with two years of data revealing the annual nGOM hypoxic zone to be emerging as a low DO adapted AOA hotspot."

Mis-expression of fgf3 or inhibition of Hh signalling results in double-anterior ears, including ectopic expression of hmx3a. To understand how this double-anterior pattern is established, we characterised transcriptional responses in Fgf gain-of-signalling or Hh loss-of-signalling backgrounds. Mis-expression of fgf3 resulted in rapid expansion of anterior otic markers, refining over time to give the duplicated pattern. Response to Hh inhibition was very different: initial anteroposterior asymmetry was retained, with de novo duplicate expression domains appearing later. We show that Hmx3a is required for normal anterior otic patterning, and that otic patterning defects in hmx3a-/- mutants are a close phenocopy to those seen in fgf3-/- mutants. However, neither loss nor gain of hmx3a function was sufficient to generate full ear duplications. Using our data to infer a transcriptional regulatory network required for acquisition of otic anterior identity, we can recapitulate both the wild-type and the double-anterior pattern in a mathematical model.",Amino acid signatures of HLA Class-I and II molecules are strongly associated with SLE susceptibility and autoantibody production in Eastern Asians.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022184,PLoS genetics,2019 06 10,"Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) is a key genetic factor conferring risk of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), but precise independent localization of HLA effects is extremely challenging. As a result, the contribution of specific HLA alleles and amino-acid residues to the overall risk of SLE and to risk of specific autoantibodies are far from completely understood. Here, we dissected (a) overall SLE association signals across HLA, (b) HLA-peptide interaction, and (c) residue-autoantibody association. Classical alleles, SNPs, and amino-acid residues of eight HLA genes were imputed across 4,915 SLE cases and 13,513 controls from Eastern Asia. We performed association followed by conditional analysis across HLA, assessing both overall SLE risk and risk of autoantibody production. DR15 alleles HLA-DRB1*15:01 (P = 1.4x10-27, odds ratio (OR) = 1.57) and HLA-DQB1*06:02 (P = 7.4x10-23, OR = 1.55) formed the most significant haplotype (OR = 2.33). Conditioned protein-residue signals were stronger than allele signals and mapped predominantly to HLA-DRB1 residue 13 (P = 2.2x10-75) and its proxy position 11 (P = 1.1x10-67), followed by HLA-DRB1-37 (P = 4.5x10-24). After conditioning on HLA-DRB1, novel associations at HLA-A-70 (P = 1.4x10-8), HLA-DPB1-35 (P = 9.0x10-16), HLA-DQB1-37 (P = 2.7x10-14), and HLA-B-9 (P = 6.5x10-15) emerged. Together, these seven residues increased the proportion of explained heritability due to HLA to 2.6%. Risk residues for both overall disease and hallmark autoantibodies (i.e., nRNP: DRB1-11, P = 2.0x10-14; DRB1-13, P = 2.9x10-13; DRB1-30, P = 3.9x10-14) localized to the peptide-binding groove of HLA-DRB1. Enrichment for specific amino-acid characteristics in the peptide-binding groove correlated with overall SLE risk and with autoantibody presence. Risk residues were in primarily negatively charged side-chains, in contrast with rheumatoid arthritis. We identified novel SLE signals in HLA Class I loci (HLA-A, HLA-B), and localized primary Class II signals to five residues in HLA-DRB1, HLA-DPB1, and HLA-DQB1. These findings provide insights about the mechanisms by which the risk residues interact with each other to produce autoantibodies and are involved in SLE pathophysiology.","Application of a targeted-enrichment methodology for full-genome sequencing of Dengue 1-4, Chikungunya and Zika viruses directly from patient samples.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022183,PLoS neglected tropical diseases,2019 05 10,"The frequency of epidemics caused by Dengue viruses 1-4, Zika virus and Chikungunya viruses have been on an upward trend in recent years driven primarily by uncontrolled urbanization, mobility of human populations and geographical spread of their shared vectors, Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus.

In this study, we present a targeted-enrichment methodology to simultaneously sequence the complete viral genomes for each of these viruses directly from clinical samples. Additionally, we have also developed a customized computational tool (BaitMaker) to design these enrichment baits.

However, the majority of studies addressing the dynamics and computational properties of biologically inspired cortical microcircuits tend to assume (often for the sake of analytical tractability) a great degree of homogeneity in both neuronal and synaptic/connectivity parameters. While simplification and reductionism are necessary to understand the brain's functional principles, disregarding the existence of the multiple heterogeneities in the cortical composition, which may be at the core of its computational proficiency, will inevitably fail to account for important phenomena and limit the scope and generalizability of cortical models. We address these issues by studying the individual and composite functional roles of heterogeneities in neuronal, synaptic and structural properties in a biophysically plausible layer 2/3 microcircuit model, built and constrained by multiple sources of empirical data. This approach was made possible by the emergence of large-scale, well curated databases, as well as the substantial improvements in experimental methodologies achieved over the last few years. Our results show that variability in single neuron parameters is the dominant source of functional specialization, leading to highly proficient microcircuits with much higher computational power than their homogeneous counterparts. We further show that fully heterogeneous circuits, which are closest to the biophysical reality, owe their response properties to the differential contribution of different sources of heterogeneity.",Structure of the human ClC-1 chloride channel.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022181,PLoS biology,2019 05 10,"ClC-1 protein channels facilitate rapid passage of chloride ions across cellular membranes, thereby orchestrating skeletal muscle excitability. Malfunction of ClC-1 is associated with myotonia congenita, a disease impairing muscle relaxation. Here, we present the cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of human ClC-1, uncovering an architecture reminiscent of that of bovine ClC-K and CLC transporters. The chloride conducting pathway exhibits distinct features, including a central glutamate residue (""fast gate"") known to confer voltage-dependence (a mechanistic feature not present in ClC-K), linked to a somewhat rearranged central tyrosine and a narrower aperture of the pore toward the extracellular vestibule. These characteristics agree with the lower chloride flux of ClC-1 compared with ClC-K and enable us to propose a model for chloride passage in voltage-dependent CLC channels. Comparison of structures derived from protein studied in different experimental conditions supports the notion that pH and adenine nucleotides regulate ClC-1 through interactions between the so-called cystathionine-β-synthase (CBS) domains and the intracellular vestibule (""slow gating""). The structure also provides a framework for analysis of mutations causing myotonia congenita and reveals a striking correlation between mutated residues and the phenotypic effect on voltage gating, opening avenues for rational design of therapies against ClC-1-related diseases.",Chemical features mining provides new descriptive structure-odor relationships.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022180,PLoS computational biology,2019 05 10,"An important goal in researching the biology of olfaction is to link the perception of smells to the chemistry of odorants.

One reason for this is that the algorithms of current models do not consistently consider the possibility that multiple chemical rules can describe a single quality despite the fact that this is the case in reality, whereby two very different molecules can evoke a similar odor. Moreover, the available datasets are often large and heterogeneous, thus rendering the generation of multiple rules without any use of a computational approach overly complex. We considered these two issues in the present paper. First, we built a new database containing 1689 odorants characterized by physicochemical properties and olfactory qualities. Second, we developed a computational method based on a subgroup discovery algorithm that discriminated perceptual qualities of smells on the basis of physicochemical properties. Third, we ran a series of experiments on 74 distinct olfactory qualities and showed that the generation and validation of rules linking chemistry to odor perception was possible. Taken together, our findings provide significant new insights into the relationship between stimulus and percept in olfaction. In addition, by automatically extracting new knowledge linking chemistry of odorants and psychology of smells, our results provide a new computational framework of analysis enabling scientists in the field to test original hypotheses using descriptive or predictive modeling.",Genome-wide sexually antagonistic variants reveal long-standing constraints on sexual dimorphism in fruit flies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022179,PLoS biology,2019 05 10,"The evolution of sexual dimorphism is constrained by a shared genome, leading to 'sexual antagonism', in which different alleles at given loci are favoured by selection in males and females. Despite its wide taxonomic incidence, we know little about the identity, genomic location, and evolutionary dynamics of antagonistic genetic variants. To address these deficits, we use sex-specific fitness data from 202 fully sequenced hemiclonal Drosophila melanogaster fly lines to perform a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of sexual antagonism. We identify approximately 230 chromosomal clusters of candidate antagonistic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). In contradiction to classic theory, we find no clear evidence that the X chromosome is a hot spot for sexually antagonistic variation. Characterising antagonistic SNPs functionally, we find a large excess of missense variants but little enrichment in terms of gene function. We also assess the evolutionary persistence of antagonistic variants by examining extant polymorphism in wild D. melanogaster populations and closely related species. Remarkably, antagonistic variants are associated with multiple signatures of balancing selection across the D. melanogaster distribution range and in their sister species D. simulans, indicating widespread and evolutionarily persistent (about 1 million years) genomic constraints on the evolution of sexual dimorphism. Based on our results, we propose that antagonistic variation accumulates because of constraints on the resolution of sexual conflict over protein coding sequences, thus contributing to the long-term maintenance of heritable fitness variation.",TASmania: A bacterial Toxin-Antitoxin Systems database.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022176,PLoS computational biology,2019 05 10,"Bacterial Toxin-Antitoxin systems (TAS) are involved in key biological functions including plasmid maintenance, defense against phages, persistence and virulence. They are found in nearly all phyla and classified into 6 different types based on the mode of inactivation of the toxin, with the type II TAS being the best characterized so far. We have herein developed a new in silico discovery pipeline named TASmania, which mines the >41K assemblies of the EnsemblBacteria database for known and uncharacterized protein components of type I to IV TAS loci. Our pipeline annotates the proteins based on a list of curated HMMs, which leads to >2.106 loci candidates, including orphan toxins and antitoxins, and organises the candidates in pseudo-operon structures in order to identify new TAS candidates based on a guilt-by-association strategy. In addition, we classify the two-component TAS with an unsupervised method on top of the pseudo-operon (pop) gene structures, leading to 1567 ""popTA"" models offering a more robust classification of the TAs families. These results give valuable clues in understanding the toxin/antitoxin modular structures and the TAS phylum specificities. Preliminary in vivo work confirmed six putative new hits in Mycobacterium tuberculosis as promising candidates.

Craniosynostosis, and the consequent skull shape deformities, is treated with surgery including osteotomies of the fused sutures. The occasional appearance of a new suture in the osteotomy lines has previously been described as sporadic events. In this retrospective study, a 4-year consecutive series of osteotomies combined with springs for craniosynostosis were systematically analysed regarding the appearance of neosutures. In total, 84 patients were included and in 16 patients (19%) a new radiologically normal suture appeared in a part of the suture that was completely closed preoperatively. Additionally, in 7 patients (8%) a new suture appeared in a part of the suture that had a discernible suture prior to surgery.In conclusion, in this consecutive and well-defined patient cohort operated for craniosynostosis, the formation of a neosuture is not a rare, and speculatively not a random, event. The appearance of a new suture long after the normal time period for suture formation in utero indicates that the craniosynostosis may just as well be caused by disturbed formation of the suture as actual premature closure.",Meibomian Gland Dysfunction in Patients Who Underwent Transconjunctival Approach Surgery for Inferior Orbital Wall Fractures.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022144,The Journal of craniofacial surgery,2019 04 25,To investigate whether transconjunctival approach surgery caused meibomian gland dysfunction in patients with inferior orbital wall fractures.,Predictability of Mandibular Autorotation After Le Fort I Maxillary Impaction in Case of Vertical Maxillary Excess.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022143,The Journal of craniofacial surgery,2019 06 05,"A retrospective study of 20 patients treated for vertical maxillary excess between 2009 and 2010, solely by superior surgical repositioning of the maxilla.

Van der Woude Syndrome is the most common form of syndromic orofacial clefting and individuals with this syndrome account for 2% of all cleft cases. Van der Woude syndrome clinically presents with congenital lip pits. These lip pits occur on paramedian portion of the vermillion border of the lip. In VWS, congenital lip pits occur in concurrence with cleft lip and/or cleft palate and represent the most common clinical problem occurring in 80% of the patients. Lip pits result due to notching of the lips at an early stage of development with fixation of tissues at the base of the notch or they may result from a failure of complete union of embryonic lateral sulci of lip. Single lip sinuses without any cleft syndrome are rare; lower lip fistulas in VWS are generally asymptomatic, and surgical management is usually accomplished because of aesthetic concerns. However, in some cases, patients may complain of watery drainage or hypotonia of the lower lip.

The purpose of this systematic review was to examine studies published since 2011 that report rates of postpartum follow-up and risk screening for women who had gestational diabetes and/or a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy and to identify disparities in care. Nine observational studies in which postpartum follow-up visits and/or screening rates were measured among US women following pregnancies complicated by gestational diabetes and/or a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy were reviewed. Rates of postpartum follow-up ranged from 5.7% to 95.4% with disparities linked to black race and Hispanic ethnicity, low level of education, and coexisting morbidities such as mental health disorders. Follow-up rates were increased if the provider was an obstetrician/endocrinologist versus primary care. Payer source was not associated with follow-up rates. The screening rate for diabetes in women who had gestational diabetes did not exceed 58% by 4 months across the studies analyzed, suggesting little improvement in the last 10 years.

A prevailing theory implicates that the generation of autoantibodies to NMDAR on neurons in the central nervous system is triggered by neuroglial tissue in the associated teratoma. The histopathology of NMDAR-E teratomas has not been fully elucidated but limited studies have focused on alterations in neuroglial tissues and immune cell populations. We hypothesized that evidence of antibody generation in NMDAR-E teratomas could be detected by colocalized neuroglial tissue and lymphoid aggregates with germinal centers as well as by alterations in the composition and morphology of neuroglial tissues. The study compared 12 NMDAR-E teratomas (11 ovarian, 1 mediastinal) with 61 control teratomas containing neuroglial tissue from women without NMDAR-E. NMDAR-E teratomas were significantly smaller and were composed of a higher percentage of neuroglial tissue than control teratomas. Many NMDAR-E teratomas did not exhibit typical gross pathologic features of a mature cystic teratoma, but were composed of predominately solid tissue (so-called Rokitansky nodule). Colocalized neuroglial tissue and lymphoid aggregates with germinal centers were present in 11/12 NMDAR-E teratomas, predominantly within the Rokitansky nodule, but only in 4/61 control teratomas (P<0.0001). There was a relative paucity of mature neurons in NMDAR-E teratomas as well as a hypercellular astrocyte population, while there were less prominent or no differences in the presence or composition of diffuse inflammatory infiltrates, lymphoid aggregates without germinal centers, ganglion cell clusters or oligodendrocytes between NMDAR-E teratomas and control teratomas. We conclude that the presence of colocalized neuroglial tissue and lymphoid aggregates with germinal centers along with a general paucity of neurons should prompt clinical consideration for NMDAR-E even in asymptomatic women, as the symptoms may occasionally develop after an otherwise incidental oophorectomy. Tissue sampling should be directed to the Rokitansky nodule, when present, to identify neuroglial tissues; complete microscopic examination of the ovarian specimen should be considered if gross pathologic features of teratoma are not present. The significance of the altered neuroglial cell populations and potential relationship to the pathogenesis of NMDAR-E merit further study.",Mucoepidermoid Carcinoma: A Comparison of Histologic Grading Systems and Relationship to MAML2 Rearrangement and Prognosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31021855,The American journal of surgical pathology,2019 06 12,"Mucoepidermoid carcinoma (MEC) is the most common salivary gland malignancy, but categorization is complicated by variability in grading systems and uncertain prognostic significance of MAML2 rearrangement. The aims of this study were to determine the prognostic significance of MEC grading systems and MAML2 rearrangement status. Fifty-three carcinomas originally diagnosed as MEC (45 primary; 8 recurrent) of major and minor salivary glands were graded according to modified Healey, Brandwein, AFIP, and Katabi systems. Fluorescence in situ hybridization for MAML2 rearrangement was performed. Clinical features and outcomes were recorded. Twenty-five (47%) carcinomas scored the same in all grading systems. The most common histologic feature leading to a diagnosis of intermediate grade was isolated solid growth. Brandwein assigned the highest percentage of high grade (29%) and AFIP the highest percentage of low grade (80%). MAML2 was rearranged in 37/46 (80%) cases. Forty-three (81%) were morphologically compatible with MEC, and these were more likely to be low-intermediate grade and MAML2-rearranged. Of primary carcinomas, 6 (13%) recurred. Statistically significant univariate risk factors for recurrence included non-MEC morphology, stage T4, and high Brandwein grade. Margin status, MAML2 rearrangement, and isolated solid growth were not predictive of recurrence. A binary grading system (Brandwein high vs. low-plus-intermediate) could be considered to better reflect biological behavior in MEC. Our study confirms that MAML2 wildtype tumors more likely represent high grade non-MECs, and prior studies demonstrating worse prognosis in MAML2-nonrearranged MECs may be diluted by high-grade non-MECs.",Comprehensive Molecular Characterization of Adamantinoma and OFD-like Adamantinoma Bone Tumors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31021853,The American journal of surgical pathology,2019 06 12,"Adamantinoma and osteofibrous dysplasia (OFD)-like adamantinoma are rare primary bone tumors that are predominantly confined to the tibia. These 2 entities show similarities in location, histology, and radiologic appearance; however, adamantinoma is malignant and therefore differentiating between these bone tumors is essential for optimal patient care. To elucidate their genomic and transcriptomic alteration profiles and expand their etiological mechanisms, whole exome sequencing (WES) and RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) were conducted on adamantinoma and OFD-like adamantinoma tumors. Copy number variation analysis using WES data revealed distinct chromosomal alteration profiles for adamantinoma tumors compared with OFD-like adamantinomas, allowing molecular differentiation between the 2 tumor subtypes. Combining WES and copy number variation analyses, the chromatin remodelling-related gene KMT2D was recurrently altered in 3/8 adamantinoma tumors (38%), highlighting the potential involvement of deregulated chromatin structure and integrity in adamantinoma tumorigenesis. RNA-Seq analysis revealed a novel somatic gene fusion (EPHB4-MARCH10) in an adamantinoma, the gene fusion was fully characterized. Hierarchical clustering analysis of RNA-Seq data distinctly clustered adamantinoma tumors from OFD-like adamantinomas, allowing to molecularly distinguish between the 2 entities. David Gene Ontology analysis of differentially expressed genes identified distinct altered pathways in adamantinoma and OFD-like adamantinoma tumors, highlighting the different histopathologic characteristics of these bone tumor subtypes. Moreover, RNA-Seq expression profiling analysis identified elevated expression of DLK1 gene in adamantinomas, serving as a potential molecular biomarker. The present study revealed novel genetic and transcriptomic insights for adamantinoma and OFD-like adamantinoma tumors, allowing to differentiate genetically and transcriptomically between the 2 lesions and identifying a potential diagnostic marker for adamantinomas.",Tenofovir concentrations in hair strongly predict virologic suppression in breastfeeding women.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31021852,"AIDS (London, England)",2019 04 25,"Antiretroviral treatment (ART) adherence is often suboptimal in the perinatal period.

With the introduction of targeted temperature management more than a decade ago, postresuscitation care has attracted increased attention. In the present review, we discuss best practice hospital management of unconscious out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients with a special focus on targeted temperature management. What is termed post-cardiac arrest syndrome strikes all organs and mandates access to specialized intensive care. All patients need a secured airway, and most patients need hemodynamic support with fluids and/or vasopressors. Furthermore, immediate coronary angiography and percutaneous coronary intervention, when indicated, has become an essential part of the postresuscitation treatment. Targeted temperature management with controlled sedation and mechanical ventilation is the most important neuroprotective strategy to take. Targeted temperature management should be initiated as quickly as possible, and according to international guidelines, it should be maintained at 32° to 36°C for at least 24 h, whereas rewarming should not increase more than 0.5°C per hour. However, uncertainty remains regarding targeted temperature management components, warranting further research into the optimal cooling rate, target temperature, duration of cooling, and the rewarming rate. Moreover, targeted temperature management is linked to some adverse effects. The risk of infection and bleeding is moderately increased, as is the risk of hypokalemia and magnesemia. Circulation needs to be monitored invasively and any deviances corrected in a timely fashion. Outcome prediction in the individual patient is challenging, and a self-fulfilling prophecy poses a real threat to early prognostication based on clinical assessment alone. Therefore, delayed and multimodal prognostication is now considered a key element of postresuscitation care. Finally, modern postresuscitation care can produce good outcomes in the majority of patients but requires major diagnostic and therapeutic resources and specific training. Hence, recent international guidelines strongly recommend the implementation of regional prehospital resuscitation systems with integrated and specialized cardiac arrest centers.",Buccal Myomucosal Flap Reconstruction After Resection of Palatal Mucoepidermoid Carcinoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31021844,Annals of plastic surgery,2019 04 25,"Salivary gland tumors are rare, constituting approximately 0.5% of pediatric malignancies, yet account for over 50% of malignant salivary gland neoplasms, of which a majority are mucoepidermoid carcinomas (MECs). We present a case of MEC involving the palatal minor salivary gland of an adolescent patient successfully reconstructed using buccal myomucosal flap. The subject presented as a 17-year-old male with a painless left hard palatal mass found to have imaging suspicious for minor salivary gland tumor and punch biopsy consistent with a low-grade MEC. The subject underwent wide local excision of a 1.0 × 1.2 cm mass with 1.0 cm margins down to hard palate nasal mucosa excluding the abutting first and second molars of the ipsilateral maxilla. Pathology confirmed low-grade MEC confined to hard palate. Two weeks, thereafter, the subject underwent buccal myomucosal flap reconstruction inset into the palatal defect and divided 2 weeks thereafter. Postoperative course was complicated by a pinpoint oronasal fistula at the posterior aspect of the flap-palate junction requiring reelevation and advancement. The subject subsequently recovered without complication. Mucoepidermoid carcinomas represent rare, malignant minor salivary gland tumors with nonspecific presentations that require multidisciplinary workup and management.

Although there are various surveys on the subject, there is no study comparing the past and the present social viewpoint and behavioral preferences for face transplantations across the world. In this study, we aimed to investigate the changes in the views of the Turkish society with respect to face transplantation from past to present. For this purpose, 1000 volunteer participants were questioned in terms of demographics and their perspective and preferences on organ and face transplantation. The results of the study were compared with the past data, and based on the results, the level of consciousness and awareness of the Turkish society about the subject has increased; the rate risk taking for immunosuppression has decreased, and instead, the rate of having an undecided stance has increased, and this attitude continues even if the risk is resolved. With these results, we can conclude that the greatest handicap for face transplantation in the Turkish society today is immunosuppression and the associated risks. We believe that new drug protocols and monitoring of patient outcomes for longer periods as well as more extensive clinical applications may be beneficial in addressing this issue."

We propose a modified convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture termed Fully Dense UNet (FD-UNet) for removing artifacts from 2D PAT images reconstructed from sparse data and compare the proposed CNN with the standard UNet in terms of reconstructed image quality.",Passivity Analysis for Quaternion-Valued Memristor-Based Neural Networks With Time-Varying Delay.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31021808,IEEE transactions on neural networks and learning systems,2019 04 29,"This paper is concerned with the problem of global exponential passivity for quaternion-valued memristor-based neural networks (QVMNNs) with time-varying delay. The QVMNNs can be seen as a switched system due to the memristor parameters are switching according to the states of the network. This is the first time that the global exponential passivity of QVMNNs with time-varying delay is investigated. By means of a nondecomposition method and structuring novel Lyapunov functional in form of quaternion self-conjugate matrices, the delay-dependent passivity criteria are derived in the forms of quaternion-valued linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) as well as complex-valued LMIs. Furthermore, the asymptotical stability criteria can be obtained from the proposed passivity criteria.

This paper addresses those problems by leveraging the concepts which derive from representation learning, adversarial learning, and transfer learning (particularly, domain adaptation). Although various transfer learning methods have shown promising performance in this context, our proposed novel method RecSys-DAN focuses on alleviating the cross-domain and within-domain data sparsity and data imbalance and learns transferable latent representations for users, items, and their interactions. Different from the existing approaches, the proposed method transfers the latent representations from a source domain to a target domain in an adversarial way. The mapping functions in the target domain are learned by playing a min-max game with an adversarial loss, aiming to generate domain indistinguishable representations for a discriminator. Four neural architectural instances of ResSys-DAN are proposed and explored. Empirical results on real-world Amazon data show that, even without using labeled data (i.e., ratings) in the target domain, RecSys-DAN achieves competitive performance as compared to the state-of-the-art supervised methods. More importantly, RecSys-DAN is highly flexible to both unimodal and multimodal scenarios, and thus it is more robust to the cold-start recommendation which is difficult for the previous methods.",Wearable Tactile Display Based on Thermal Expansion of Nichrome Wire.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31021806,IEEE transactions on haptics,2019 04 29,"A wearable tactile display needs to be compact and lightweight, and ideally should be able to present vibration, force and temperature information to the hand. In many contexts spatially distributed tactile information is needed such as when identifying the shape of objects. In this paper, a multi-element tactile display is described based on the thermal expansion and contraction of nichrome wire. The device comprises elastic rods that are pulled by nichrome wires ( 30 μm in diameter). When an electrical current is applied to the wire, displacement of the elastic rod occurs with thermal elongation of the wire. The wire cools quickly and vibration results. The nichrome wire that is the basis of this display overcomes many of the material restrictions associated with shape memory alloys (SMA) that have often been used for thermally driven tactile displays. Experiments that characterized the performance of the tactile display indicated that perceptible vibrations up to 320 Hz can be presented. Psychophysical studies revealed that both position and movement cues can be displayed effectively with the device. A miniaturized version of this display for wearable applications has been built and undergone preliminary evaluation.",Accuracy of Dynamic Force Compensation Varies with Direction and Speed.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31021805,IEEE transactions on haptics,2019 05 06,This study investigates physical responses to force perturbations while tracking a moving target.

Current methods have identified these models from single-scale activity, either spikes or fields. However, behavior is simultaneously encoded across multiple spatiotemporal scales of activity, from spikes of individual neurons to neural population activity measured through fields. Identifying a multiscale dynamical model to extract hidden states that simultaneously describe spike-field activities is challenging because of their fundamental differences. Spikes are binary-valued with fast millisecond time-scales while fields are continuous-valued with slower time-scales. Here, we develop a novel multiscale dynamical modeling and identification algorithm to simultaneously characterize multiscale spike-field dynamics and extract multiscale hidden states. We also devise a modal approach to dissociate task-relevant and task-irrelevant dynamics. Using extensive simulations, we show that the algorithm accurately identifies a multiscale dynamical model to simultaneously describe spike-field dynamics. Furthermore, the algorithm extracts hidden states that are multiscale, i.e., contain information from both spikes and fields and accurately predict behavior. Finally, the algorithm detects which of the identified dynamics are task-relevant and to what extent. This multiscale dynamical modeling and identification framework can help study neural dynamics across spatiotemporal scales and may facilitate future neurotechnologies.",Multiclass Support Matrix Machines by Maximizing the Inter-Class Margin for Single Trial EEG Classification.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31021801,IEEE transactions on neural systems and rehabilitation engineering : a publication of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society,2019 06 10,"Accurate classification of Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals plays an important role in diagnoses of different type of mental activities.

Aiming to improve the classification performance, in this paper, we propose a novel multiclass support matrix machine (M-SMM) from the perspective of maximizing the inter-class margins. The objective function is a combination of binary hinge loss that works on C matrices and spectral elastic net penalty as regularization term. This regularization term is a combination of Frobenius and nuclear norm, which promotes structural sparsity and shares similar sparsity patterns across multiple predictors. It also maximizes the inter-class margin that helps to deal with complex high dimensional noisy data.

The numerous studies have shown artificial sensory feedback of various forms improves force control during grasping tasks by prosthetic hand users through a closed-feedback loop. However, little is known about how perceptual information is transferred between an intact limb and a closed-loop prosthetic limb, and the extent to which training inter-limb transfer may improve myoelectric prosthetic control. We addressed these gaps by using a contralateral force-matching task in which able-bodied participants were asked to generate grasp forces with their native hand, and then match it using the contralateral hand or a soft-synergy prosthetic hand worn on the contralateral arm that was coupled with a mechanotactile feedback device. We found that absolute matching error and matching time were greater when using the prosthetic system than the native hand. However, with contralateral specific training, subjects were able to produce similar relative matching error with the prosthetic system and the native hand, especially at the untrained force level. These findings suggest that an association can be established between the perception produced by the prosthetic limb and the contralateral intact limb, and provide novel insights about potential applications to training and design of the closed-loop prosthesis.",A Survey of Full-Body Motion Reconstruction in Immersive Virtual Reality Applications.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31021797,IEEE transactions on visualization and computer graphics,2019 04 29,"Due to recent advances in virtual reality (VR) technology, the development of immersive VR applications that track body motions and visualize a full-body avatar is attracting increasing research interest. This paper reviews related research to gather and to critically analyze recent improvements regarding the potential of full-body motion reconstruction in VR applications. We conducted a systematic literature search, matching VR and full-body tracking related keywords on IEEE Xplore, PubMed, ACM, and Scopus. Fifty-three publications were included and assigned in three groups: studies using markerless and marker-based motion tracking systems as well as systems using inertial measurement units. All analyzed research publications track the motions of the user wearing a head-mounted display and visualize a full-body avatar. The analysis confirmed that a full-body avatar can enhance the sense of embodiment and can improve the immersion within the VR. The results indicated that the Kinect device is still the most frequently used sensor (27 out of 53). Furthermore, there is a trend to track the movements of multiple users simultaneously. Many studies that enable multiplayer mode in VR use marker-based systems (7 out of 17) because they are much more robust and can accurately track full-body movements of multiple users in real-time.",External Patch-Based Image Restoration Using Importance Sampling.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31021796,IEEE transactions on image processing : a publication of the IEEE Signal Processing Society,2019 04 29,"This paper introduces a new approach to patchbased image restoration based on external datasets and importance sampling. The minimum mean squared error (MMSE) estimate of the image patches, the computation of which requires solving a multidimensional (typically intractable) integral, is approximated using samples from an external dataset. The new method, which can be interpreted as a generalization of the external non-local means (NLM), uses self-normalized importance sampling to efficiently approximate the MMSE estimates. The use of self-normalized importance sampling endows the proposed method with great flexibility, namely regarding the statistical properties of the measurement noise. The effectiveness of the proposed method is shown in a series of experiments using both generic large-scale and class-specific external datasets."

We handle the acoustic part of the problem by modeling the cluster as a sensor network, and we propose a centralized control strategy for the agents that exploits the spatial sensitivity pattern of the sensor network to estimate the best possible cluster configuration with respect to the expected target position. In order to take into account the position estimation delay due to the frame-based nature of the processing, the possible positions of the acoustic target in a given future time interval are represented in terms of a compatible set, that is, the set of all possible future positions of the target, given its dynamics and its present state. A frame-by-frame cluster reconfiguration algorithm is presented, which adapts the position of each sensing agent with the goal of pursuing the maximum overlap between the region of high acoustic sensitivity of the entire cluster and the compatible set of the sound-emitting target. The tracking scheme iterates, at each observation frame, the computation of the target compatible set, the reconfiguration of the cluster, and the target acoustic localization. The reconfiguration step makes use of an opportune cost function proportional to the difference of the compatibility set and the acoustic sensitivity spatial pattern determined by the mobile agent positions. Simulations under different geometric configurations and positioning constraints demonstrate the ability of the proposed approach to effectively localize and track a moving target based on its acoustic emission. The Doppler effect related to moving sources and sensors is taken into account, and its impact on performance is analyzed. We compare the localization results with conventional static-array localization and positioning of acoustic sensors through genetic algorithm optimization, and results demonstrate the sensible improvements in terms of localization and tracking performance. Although the method is discussed here with respect to acoustic target tracking, it can be effectively adapted to video-based localization and tracking, or to multimodal information settings (e.g., audio and video).",Stacking-Based Deep Neural Network: Deep Analytic Network for Pattern Classification.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31021783,IEEE transactions on cybernetics,2019 04 29,"Stacking-based deep neural network (S-DNN) is aggregated with pluralities of basic learning modules, one after another, to synthesize a deep neural network (DNN) alternative for pattern classification.

In this paper, a ridge regression-based S-DNN, dubbed deep analytic network (DAN), along with its kernelization (K-DAN), are devised for multilayer feature relearning from the pre-extracted baseline features and the structured features. Our theoretical formulation demonstrates that DAN/K-DAN relearn by perturbing the intra/interclass variations, apart from diminishing the prediction errors. We scrutinize the DAN/K-DAN performance for pattern classification on datasets of varying domains--faces, handwritten digits, generic objects, to name a few. Unlike the typical BP-optimized DNNs to be trained from gigantic datasets by GPU, we reveal that DAN/K-DAN are trainable using only CPU even for small-scale training sets.

For each agent, only the discrete-time information of its neighbors is used in the design of formation controllers and event triggers. Triggering time instants for any agent are determined by certain events that depend on the states of its neighboring agents. Continuous updating of controllers and continuous communication among neighboring agents are avoided. The obtained results show that formation can reach specific but arbitrary formation shape. Furthermore, it is shown that the closed-loop system does not exhibit the Zeno phenomenon for the continuous-time dynamics case or the Zeno-like behavior for the discrete-time dynamics case. Finally, numerical simulations for both the continuous-time and the discrete-time dynamics cases are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed distributed event-triggered control methods.",Sampled-Data-Based H_∞ Synchronization of Switched Coupled Neural Networks.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31021781,IEEE transactions on cybernetics,2019 04 29,"This paper investigates the sampled-data-based H_∞ synchronization problem for a class of switched coupled neural networks subject to exogenous perturbations.

In the framework of time-dependent switching mechanism, sufficient conditions for the existence of the sampled-data controllers are derived under the variable sampling and asynchronous switching. We prove that the proposed method not only renders the synchronization error system exponentially stable but also constrains the influence of the exogenous perturbations on the synchronization performance at a specified level.

The core requirement for dealing with such problems is to balance the ability of exploration in the global space and exploitation in the multiple optimal areas. In this paper, based on the differential evolution (DE), we propose a novel algorithm focusing on the formulation, balance, and keypoint of species for MMOPs, called FBK-DE. First, nearest-better clustering (NBC) is used to divide the population into multiple species with minimum size limitations. Second, to avoid placing too many individuals into one species, a species balance strategy is proposed to adjust the size of each species. Third, two keypoint-based mutation operators named DE/keypoint/1 and DE/keypoint/2 are proposed to evolve each species together with traditional mutation operators. The experimental results of FBK-DE on 20 benchmark functions are compared with 15 state-of-the-art multimodal optimization algorithms. The comparisons show that the proposed FBK-DE performs competitively with these algorithms.",Robust Heart Rate Monitoring for Quasi-periodic Motions by Wrist-Type PPG Signals.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31021779,IEEE journal of biomedical and health informatics,2019 04 29,"Heart rate (HR) monitoring using photoplethysmography (PPG) is a promising feature in modern wearable devices. PPG is easily contaminated by motion artifacts (MA), hindering estimation of HR. For quasi-periodic motions, previous works generally focused on a few specific motions, such as walking and fast running. However, they may not work well for many different quasi-periodic motions where MA are very complex. In this paper, a robust HR monitoring scheme for different quasi-periodic motions using wrist-type PPG is proposed, which consists of dictionary learning for signal characteristics learning, human motion recognition for the current motion recognition and dictionary selection, sparse representation-based MA elimination for denoising, and spectral peak tracking for HR-related spectral peak tracking. The proposed scheme is robust to MA caused by different motions and has high accuracy. Experiments on six common quasi-periodic motions showed that the average absolute error of heart rate estimation was 2.40 beat per minute, and also showed that the proposed method is more robust than some state-of-the-art approaches for different motions.",Segmenting diabetic retinopathy lesions in multispectral images using low-dimensional spatial-spectral matrix representation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31021778,IEEE journal of biomedical and health informatics,2019 04 29,"Multispectral Imaging (MSI) provides a sequence of en-face fundus spectral slices and allows for the examination of structures and signatures throughout the thickness of retina to characterize diabetic retinopathy (DR) lesions comprehensively.

By continuous monitoring of the heart rate, ICDs can use decision algorithms to distinguish normal cardiac sinus rhythm or supra-ventricular tachycardia from abnormal cardiac rhythms like ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation and deliver appropriate therapy such as an electrical stimulus. Despite the success of ICDs, more research is still needed, particularly in decision-making algorithms. Because of low specificity in practical devices, patients with ICDs still receive inappropriate shocks which may lead to inadvertent mortality and reduction of quality of life. At the same time, higher sensitivity can lead to the use of newer tiered therapies. The purpose of this study is to review the literature on common signal features used in detection algorithms for abnormal cardiac sinus rhythm, as well as reviewing data sets used for algorithm development in previous studies. More than fifty different features to address heart rate changes before SCD have been reviewed and general methodology on this area proposed based on variety of studies on ICDs functionality. A comparative study on the prediction performance of these features, using a common database, is also presented.

The method is based on a contact model initially developed to predict the ground reaction forces and moments. Discrete contact points are defined on the biomechanical model at the feet and the hands. An optimization technique computes the minimal forces at each of these points satisfying the dynamic equations of the biomechanical model and the load. The method was tested on a set of asymmetric handling tasks performed by 13 subjects and validated using force platforms and an instrumented load.

However, the limited size of portable ultrasound devices usually degrades the imaging quality, which reduces the diagnostic reliability. To overcome hardware limitations and improve the image quality of portable ultrasound devices, we propose a novel generative adversarial network (GAN) model to achieve mapping between low-quality ultrasound images and corresponding high-quality images. In contrast to the traditional GAN method, our two-stage GAN that cascades a U-Net network prior to the generator as a front end is built to reconstruct the tissue structure, details and speckle of the reconstructed image.

Thanks to the widespread availability of inexpensive genome sequencing technology, the field is expanding rapidly. Many countries plan to sequence significant proportions of their population, and individuals are using genome sequences to discover more about themselves. The (no doubt already sequenced) elephant in the room is that each whole genome produces a data file of around 100 GB. If the demand for genome sequences continues at its current rate, genomic sequencing could be producing 40 exabytes of data per year by 2025 [1]."

Its use with parasites of humans has been limited with some groups of nematodes where the amplification of this gene has been difficult. In this study, we present the first COI barcode sequence of a rare parasite from tropical regions, Lagochilascaris minor, which parasitized a human host from Quintana Roo, southern Yucatán Peninsula, Mexico. Destruction of the mastoid apophysis in the lateral sinus and cerebellar involvement were observed at the site of infection. After a radical mastoidectomy and a treatment with 200 mg oral albendazole for 63 days, the patient completely recovered. Lagochilascaris minor was identified based on the ratio between length of spicules and ejaculatory duct, shape of eggs, and host, as well as comparison with its congeners. The mode of infection is unknown, although it could be after direct exposure to eggs or consumption of uncooked wild meat. Morphology of adults is demonstrated using scanning electron microscopy, and high-quality sequences of COI barcode are presented from amplifications using semi-degenerate primers designed for micro-crustaceans. DNA barcoding proved to be a reliable identification method for L. minor. A comparison of the sequences for this species with 81 ascaridoids obtained from the Barcode of Life Database places it in a unique clade most closely related to Baylisascaris procyonis. Future diagnosis of larval and adult stages of L. minor using DNA barcoding will allow the recognition of its infection parameters, transmission, and precise epidemiology. Reports of lagochilascarosis in the Yucatán Peninsula have been occurred over the last decade, suggesting it is an emerging zoonotic disease in the region.",Cercarial Behavior Determines Risk of Predation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31021737,The Journal of parasitology,2019 04 25,"The potential for local biodiversity to affect transmission success of parasites has been shown to be particularly important in trematodes, where non-host organisms can feed on and 'dilute' free-living infective stages (cercariae). Earlier studies have analyzed the effects of various predators on transmission stages of single trematode species, but not how cercariae of different species react to predation pressure. Here, we tested whether cercariae with different host-searching movement patterns show varying susceptibility to predation by non-host species with different feeding habits. For this study, we performed a set of predation experiments with 6 species of trematode cercariae (Coitocaecum parvum, Maritrema poulini, Apatemon sp., Telogaster opisthorchis, Plagiorchioid sp. I, and Aporocotylid sp. II) that represent 2 groups of host-searching behavior, free-swimming vs. bottom-dwelling, and 2 predators ( Sphaerium sp., Physa acuta) with distinct feeding modes, a filter feeder and a grazer. Our results show that cercarial susceptibility to predation is highly dependent on the interspecific interaction between dispersal behavior of cercariae and feeding behavior of non-host organisms: Filter feeders only diluted free-swimming cercarial stages, not bottom-dwelling ones; grazers on the other hand, had no effect on free-swimming cercariae but reduced bottom-dwelling cercariae in 1 trematode species. Our findings give further support to the hypothesis that the transmission dynamics of trematodes do not simply depend on local biodiversity but rather on the species-specific interactions between parasite transmission stages and free-living organisms in the ecosystem. This has important implications for disease dynamics in ecological communities (e.g., the parasites' infection success), and for ecosystem energetics, as cercariae constitute important food items.",The Influence of Host Body Size and Food Guild On Prevalence and Mean Intensity of Chewing Lice (Phthiraptera) On Birds In Southern China.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31021736,The Journal of parasitology,2019 04 25,"Chewing lice (Insecta: Phthiraptera) are abundant ectoparasites of birds and mammals. They are adapted to life in the plumage or pelage of their hosts and virtually never leave the host during their life cycle. Most species are highly host specific. This study was carried out to determine species richness, abundance, and prevalence of chewing lice of wild forest birds in the southern region of China. Between July 2012 and June 2016, 2,210 birds (belonging to 8 orders, 45 families, and 215 species) were captured by mist nets and examined for chewing lice. In total, 622 birds of 117 species were parasitized by lice belonging to 89 species in 25 genera from 2 suborders (Amblycera and Ischnocera). Of these, 28 louse species represent new host-louse records for China and 10 worldwide. Chewing louse prevalence varied significantly among host species. There was no evidence of a correlation between climate zones and louse prevalence, but host guild affected prevalence significantly, with insectivorous birds having the lowest prevalence. Louse prevalence was positively correlated with host body mass and bill length, but mean intensity was only correlated with host body mass. These findings contribute further knowledge of avian chewing lice.",New Observations Allowing the Differentiation of Late Asexual Stages of Cystoisospora canis from Developing Microgamonts in the Intestines of Experimentally Infected Dogs.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31021735,The Journal of parasitology,2019 04 25,"The coccidian parasite Cystoisospora canis (syn. Isospora canis) can cause clinical disease in dogs. Three generations of meronts are reported to occur in the small intestine of experimentally infected dogs before gametogony and oocyst formation. Oocyst excretion in the feces occurs at 9 to 11 days post-inoculation (PI). We examined the late asexual and sexual development of C. canis in 2 dogs necropsied 10 days after oral inoculation with 100,000 sporulated C. canis oocysts; both dogs had excreted oocysts 9 days PI. Asexual and sexual stages were seen in the lamina propria, throughout the small intestine in sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin from both dogs. In other studies of the C. canis life cycle, little attention has been given to distinguishing the last asexual generation of meronts and early microgamonts that can appear similar due to their stage of maturation and both having multiple nuclei. Here we report newly identified features of developing meronts and microgamonts and their distinction from each other by using sections processed using the periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) reaction. Using this method, we demonstrated that PAS-positive granules could be used to identify microgamonts and differentiate them from developing meront stages. These findings will aid pathologists and others in properly identifying coccidial parasites, in determining the cause of microscopic lesions in intestinal tissue, and in accurately identifying etiological agents.",Radiation-Induced Mitotic Catastrophe Enhanced by Gold Nanoparticles: Assessment with a Specific Automated Image Processing Workflow.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31021734,Radiation research,2019 04 25,"In recent years, the use of gold-based nanoparticles in radiotherapy has been extensively studied, and the associated radiosensitization mechanism has been evaluated in a variety of in vitro studies. Given that mitotic catastrophe is widely involved in radiation-induced cell death, we evaluated the effect of gold nanoparticles on this key event. Most of the methods currently used to visualize and quantify morphological changes and multinucleation are manual. To circumvent this time-consuming step, we developed and optimized an image processing workflow (based on freely accessible software and plugins) for the automated quantification of mitotic catastrophes. We validated this approach in three cell lines by comparing the number of radiation-induced mitotic catastrophes detected using the automated and manual methods in the presence and absence of nanoparticles. With the Bland-Altman analysis, the automated and manual counting methods were found to be fully interchangeable. The ultimate goal of this work was to determine whether mitotic catastrophe was critically involved in radiation-induced cell death after prior exposure to gold nanoparticles. In the radioresistant U87 cell line, exposure to gold nanoparticles was associated with a shorter time course for the events related to mitotic catastrophe, which peaked at 96 h postirradiation. Mitotic catastrophe was dose-dependent in both the presence and absence of gold nanoparticles. These results demonstrate that cell exposure to gold nanoparticles led to an increase in mitotic catastrophe events, and confirm the marked radiosensitizing effect observed in clonogenic assays.",Adrenergic Receptor Signaling Regulates the Response of Tumors to Ionizing Radiation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31021732,Radiation research,2019 06 04,"While ionizing radiation is a major form of cancer therapy, radioresistance remains a therapeutic obstacle. We have previously shown that the mandated housing temperature for laboratory mice (∼22°C) induces mild, but chronic, cold stress resulting in increased circulating norepinephrine, which binds to, and triggers activation of, beta-adrenergic receptors (β-AR) on tumor and immune cells. This adrenergic signaling increases tumor cell intrinsic resistance to chemotherapy and suppression of the anti-tumor immune response. These findings led us to hypothesize that adrenergic stress signaling increases radioresistance in tumor cells in addition to suppressing T-cell-mediated anti-tumor immunity, thus suppressing the overall sensitivity of tumors to radiation. We used three strategies to test the effect of adrenergic signaling on responsiveness to radiation. For one strategy, mice implanted with CT26 murine colon adenocarcinoma were housed at either 22°C or at thermoneutrality (30°C), which reduces physiological adrenergic stress. For a second strategy, we used a β-AR antagonist (""beta blocker"") to block adrenergic signaling in mice housed at 22°C. In either case, tumors were then irradiated with a single 6 Gy dose and the response was compared to mice whose adrenergic stress signaling was not reduced. For the third strategy, we used an in vitro approach in which several different tumor cell lines were treated with a β-AR agonist and irradiated, and cell survival was then assessed by clonogenic assay. Overall, we found that adrenergic stress significantly impaired the anti-tumor efficacy of radiation by inducing tumor cell resistance to radiation-induced cell killing and by suppression of anti-tumor immunity. Treatment using beta blockers is a promising strategy for increasing the anti-tumor efficacy of radiotherapy.",Evaluation of serum prolidase activity and oxidative stress in patients with temporomandibular joint internal derangement.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31021718,Cranio : the journal of craniomandibular practice,2019 04 25,To investigate serum prolidase activity and oxidative stress in patients with temporomandibular joint internal derangement (TMJ-ID).,SUGAR (Sampling Utterances and Grammatical Analysis Revised): Breaking Tradition.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31021717,"Language, speech, and hearing services in schools",2019 06 03,"Purpose In this letter, the authors respond to Guo, Eisenberg, Ratner, and MacWhinney's (2018) letter to the editor, which expressed concerns regarding the clinical applicability of the Sampling Utterances and Grammatical Analysis Revised (SUGAR; Pavelko & Owens, 2017 ) language sample analysis (LSA) method.

Our results showed that NAT treatment obviously decreased liver weight (p < 0.01), improved the liver morphological structure, decreased ALT level (p < 0.05) and endotoxin (LPS) (p < 0.01). In addition, NAT could regulate bile acid profiles in feces and serum of mice, which indicated the potential of liver function, suggesting that NAT was effective to relieve intense exercise-induced liver injury. NAT could regulate the expression of colon genes. NAT tended to alter the microbial composition of mice under intense exercise. We uncovered the network interactions between liver traits and microbial communities in NAT treatment mice. Interestingly, our data indicated that intense exercise-induced liver injury may be related to Clostridiales. In summary, these results demonstrated that NAT relieved liver injury induced by intense exercise may be related to gut microbiota.",Do Party Schools Report Higher Rates of Violence Against Women in Their Clery Data?

Latent class analysis (LCA) was used to identify five types of campuses: smaller (22%), liberal arts (25%), satellite (16%), private (19%), and party schools (18%). Smaller schools reported the lowest rates of violence against women (VAW), whereas private schools had significantly higher reported rapes. These findings have important implications for the types of campuses seem to be abiding by Clery law and reporting crimes that involve VAW.","RSV recombinant candidate vaccine G1F/M2 with CpG as an adjuvant prevents vaccine-associated lung inflammation, which may be associated with the appropriate types of immune memory in spleens and lungs.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31021703,Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics,2019 04 29,"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major respiratory pathogen in infants. The early formalin-inactivated RSV not only failed to protect infants against infection, but also was associated with enhanced pulmonary inflammatory disease upon natural infection. A safe and effective vaccine should prevent the inflammatory disease and provide protection. Immune memory is the cornerstone of vaccines. In this study, we evaluated three types of immune memory T cells, antibodies, and lung inflammation of a vaccine candidate G1F/M2, which includes a neutralizing epitope fragment of RSV G protein and a cytotoxic T lymphocyte epitope of M2 protein, with toll-like receptor 9 agonist CpG2006 as an adjuvant by intranasal (i.n.) and intraperitoneal (i.p.) immunization protocols. The results indicated that immunization of mice with G1F/M2 + CpG i.p. induced significantly higher level of CD4+ or CD8+ central memory (TCM), Th1-type effector memory (TEM), and balanced ratio of IgG1/IgG2a, but lower level of lung tissue-resident memory (TRM), compared with immunization with G1F/M2 + CpG i.n., G1F/M2 i.n., or G1F/M2 i.p. Following RSV challenge, the mice immunized with G1F/M2 + CpG i.p. showed higher level of Th1-type responses, remarkably suppressed inflammatory cytokines and histopathology in lungs, compared with mice immunized with G1F/M2 + CpG i.n., G1F/M2 i.n., or G1F/M2 i.p. These results suggested that high level of TCM and Th1 type of TEM in spleens may contribute to inhibition of lung inflammation, while high level of TRM in lungs and lack of or weak Th1-type immune memory in spleens may promote lung inflammation following RSV challenge.",The Effect of Noninvasive Brain Stimulation on Poststroke Cognitive Function: A Systematic Review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31021702,Neurorehabilitation and neural repair,2019 05 23,"Cognitive impairment after stroke has been associated with lower quality of life and independence in the long run, stressing the need for methods that target impairment for cognitive rehabilitation.

Therefore, we conducted a systematic review that evaluates the effects of different stimulation techniques on domain-specific (long-term) cognitive recovery after stroke.","In vitro characterization and preclinical immunogenicity of Typhax, a typhoid fever protein capsular matrix vaccine candidate.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31021700,Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics,2019 05 28,"Typhax is an investigational typhoid fever vaccine candidate that was GMP manufactured applying Protein Capsular Matrix Vaccine (PCMV) technology. It consists of Vi polysaccharide antigen, derived from S. Typhi, non-covalently entrapped in a glutaraldehyde catalyzed cross-linked α-poly-L-lysine and CRM197 protein matrix. Analysis of Typhax determined the average molecular weight of the vaccine particles was approximately 6 x 106 Daltons, corresponding to particles containing 1-2 molecules of Vi polysaccharide and 10-20 molecules of CRM197 protein. The ratio of the concentration of Vi to CRM197 protein in Typhax is 2.4:1. Preclinical immunogenicity studies in mice demonstrated that Typhax was immunogenic and elicited a significant increase in anti-Vi IgG antibody titers following each immunization. The anti-Vi IgG antibody response elicited by Typhax in rabbits increased as the dose increased from 0.1 µg to 2.5 µg. Further, at the 2.5 and 10 µg dose levels, the anti-Vi IgG antibody titers increased after the second and third immunizations. At the 10 µg dose level, 100% of rabbits seroconverted. In the non-human primate (NHP) study, 100% seroconversion was observed at both 2.5 µg and 10 µg dose levels after the first immunization. A murine in vivo immunopotency study demonstrated that Typhax stored at 4°C was stable for at least 30 months. Collectively, the Typhax in vitro profile, preclinical immunogenicity studies, and rabbit toxicology study indicate that Typhax is a viable typhoid fever vaccine candidate for Phase 1 clinical trial evaluation.",Readability of Individuals With Disabilities Education Act Part B Procedural Safeguards: An Update.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31021699,"Language, speech, and hearing services in schools",2019 06 03,"Purpose The purpose of this study was to analyze the readability of Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) Part B procedural safeguard documents, as distributed by each of the 50 U.S. states. Results were compared to the 5th- to 6th-grade readability guideline for documents recommended by experts in health literacy and health communication. Method A commercially available readability software, Readability Studio ( Oleander Software, 2009 ), was used to assess document readability. Text-based files of each IDEA Part B procedural safeguard document were analyzed using four readability formulas: Flesch-Kincaid ( Flesch, 1965 ), Gunning fog index ( Gunning, 1952 ), Flesch Reading Ease ( Flesch, 1948 ), and Simple Measure of Gobbledygook ( McLaughlin, 1969 ). Results No procedural safeguard document scored below an 11th-grade reading level.

It is now well established that bacterial communication regulates hundreds of genes. Hydrophobic molecules which do not diffuse in aqueous environments alone have been identified in bacterial communication, that raised the question on how these molecules are transported between cells and trigger gene expressions. Recent studies show that these hydrophobic signaling molecules, including a long-chain N-acyl homoserine lactone signal produced in Paracoccus denitrificans, are carried by membrane vesicles (MVs). MVs were thought to be formed only through the blebbing of the cell membrane, but new findings in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Bacillus subtilis revealed that different types of MVs can be formed through explosive cell lysis or bubbling cell death, which findings have certain implications on our view of bacterial interactions.",Sodium chloride primes JA-independent defense against Spodoptera litura (Fabricius) larvae in Arabidopsis thaliana.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31021696,Plant signaling & behavior,2019 06 07,"Priming for better defense performance is an important strategy in acclimation to the ever-changing environment.

The previously primed plants could effectively resist the feeding of Spodoptera litura (Fabricius) larvae. Salt-priming enhanced defense of Arabidopsis plants in the absence of either MYC2 or AOS, which encodes a critical transcription factor in JA-signaling and an important enzyme in JA biosynthesis, respectively.

Dysregulation of cortisol, a common biomarker of stress, is associated with cognitive dysfunction in different clinical populations. However, little is known about the consequences of stress-induced cortisol disturbances for stroke survivors, including those with aphasia. Method Nineteen participants with aphasia and 14 age-matched neurotypical adults were tested. Saliva samples were collected from participants to assess the cortisol awakening response, a marker of the integrity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Participants also completed 2 subjective stress questionnaires. Language was evaluated using 3 short, picture description narratives, analyzed for discourse (dys)fluency and productivity markers. Results In contrast to neurotypical participants, adults with aphasia did not show the predictable cortisol awakening response. Participants with aphasia also showed an unusual heightened level of cortisol upon awakening. Additionally, neurotypical participants demonstrated an association between intact language performance and the cortisol awakening response, whereas the participants with aphasia did not, although they did perceive the language tasks as stressful. Conclusion This study indicates that the functionality of the HPA axis, as indexed by cortisol, contributes to optimal language performance in healthy adults. The absence of an awakening response among participants with aphasia suggests that stroke leads to dysregulation of the HPA axis, although the degree to which this impairment affects language deficits in this population requires further investigation.",Differentiating Beyond Name Agreement for Picture Naming: Insight From Age-Related Selection Deficits.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31021678,"Journal of speech, language, and hearing research : JSLHR",2019 05 24,"Purpose Pictures consistently referred to by the same name (high agreement) are named faster than pictures that elicit inconsistent responses across individuals (low agreement). Although this effect is more pronounced in older adults apparently due to slower lexical selection, it is unclear whether this is consistent for different types of low agreement pictures. We investigated whether pictures with different sources of disagreement have differing selection requirements, as indexed by naming latencies. Method Picture naming latencies were compared for 20 young (ages 18-35 years) and 20 older adults (ages 60-80 years) across 3 object naming conditions: high name agreement, low name agreement due to multiple correct names, and low agreement due to abbreviations and elaborations. Results Compared to high agreement items, responses were slower specifically for low agreement items with multiple names, and to a lesser extent, items with abbreviations and elaborations ( p < .001). Older adults were slower than younger adults, especially for low agreement items with abbreviations and elaborations ( p = .031). Conclusions Our findings indicate differential lexical selection requirements for low agreement pictures, depending on the reason for agreement being low. This demonstrates the importance of differentiating the source of disagreement in any experimental or clinical assessment of picture naming.",Impact of a Cancer Urgent Care Clinic on Regional Emergency Department Visits.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31021677,Journal of oncology practice,2019 06 11,Did the creation of an urgent care clinic specifically for patients with cancer affect emergency department visits among adults newly diagnosed with cancer?,Reference Values for Healthy Swallowing Across the Range From Thin to Extremely Thick Liquids.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31021676,"Journal of speech, language, and hearing research : JSLHR",2019 05 24,"Purpose Thickened liquids are frequently used as an intervention for dysphagia, but gaps persist in our understanding of variations in swallowing behavior based on incremental thickening of liquids.

Results The results clarify that, for thin liquid sips (10-14 ml), a single swallow without clearing swallows is typical and is characterized by complete laryngeal vestibule closure, complete pharyngeal constriction, and minimal postswallow residue. Aspiration was not seen, and penetration was extremely rare. Bolus position at swallow onset was variable, extending as low as the pyriform sinuses in 37% of cases. With thicker liquids, no changes in event sequencing, laryngeal vestibule closure, pharyngeal constriction, or postswallow residue were seen. The odds of penetration were significantly reduced. A longer timing interval until onset of the hyoid burst movement was seen, with an associated higher bolus position at swallow onset. Other timing measures remained unaffected by changes in bolus consistency. Conclusion The results include new reference data for swallowing in healthy adults across the range from thin to extremely thick liquids.","Analysis of prevalence, risk factors, and potential costs of unnecessary drug therapy in patients with chronic diseases at the outpatient setting.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31021675,Expert review of pharmacoeconomics & outcomes research,2019 05 14,Patients with chronic diseases require long-term use of medications and are at risk for prescription of unnecessary drugs.,Language Ability and the Familiar Talker Advantage: Generalizing to Unfamiliar Talkers Is What Matters.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31021674,"Journal of speech, language, and hearing research : JSLHR",2019 05 24,"Purpose Previous studies with children and adults have demonstrated a familiar talker advantage-better word recognition for familiar talkers. The goal of the current study was to test whether this phenomenon is modulated by a child's language ability. Method Sixty children with a range of language ability were trained to learn the voices of 3 foreign-accented, German-English bilingual talkers and received feedback about their performance. Both before and after this talker voice training, children completed a spoken word recognition task in which they heard consonant-vowel-consonant words mixed with noise that were spoken by the 3 familiarized talkers and by 3 unfamiliar German-English bilinguals. Results Two findings emerged from this study: First, children with both higher and lower language ability performed similarly on the familiarized talkers. Second, children with higher language scores performed similarly on both the familiarized and unfamiliar talkers, whereas children with lower language scores performed worse on the unfamiliar talkers compared to familiar talkers, suggesting an inability to generalize to novel, unfamiliar talkers who spoke with a similar accent. Discussion Together, these findings indicate that children with higher language scores are able to generalize knowledge about foreign-accented talkers to help spoken word recognition for novel talkers with the same accent. In contrast, children with lower language skills did not exhibit the same magnitude of generalization. This lack of generalization to similar talkers may mean that children with lower language skills are at a disadvantage in spoken language tasks because they are unable to process speech as well when listening to unfamiliar talkers.",Mental Ill Health in Homeless Women: A Review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31021673,Issues in mental health nursing,2019 04 25,"Research indicates that homeless women are reported to experience more mental health issues than women who are not homeless and are an increasing proportion of the overall homeless population. In addition, homeless women are more likely to have alcohol and/or other drug use disorders. We provide a comprehensive review of the contemporary literature that revealed homeless women experience a range of mental health problems including depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder and alcohol and other drug use disorders. Studies in this literature review indicate that some women have pre-existing mental health issues which precipitate homelessness while others develop mental illness because of their homelessness; domestic violence was also recognised as an antecedent to homelessness, although further research is needed in this area. The results of this study indicate that the homeless cohort is a complex one with distinct needs. We provide information that can help refine assessment processes and plan appropriate services to address the mental health needs of homeless women. Finally, recommendations for mental health nursing practice in regard to caring for homeless women are made.","Impact of a family interventions module on students' knowledge, skills and attitudes.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31021672,Issues in mental health nursing,2019 04 25,"Current evidence strongly supports the implementation of family interventions as a recognised approach to working with families. The aim of this study was to evaluate postgraduate students' learning experiences and skills development whilst undertaking a Master of Science module in family interventions. Questionnaires were used to elicit students' learning and experiences in relation to their work with families. Following analysis of students' responses, the key themes that emerged in relation to family interventions included: prior learning and experiences, changes in practice, skills development, supports in practice, and course strengths and challenges. Participants particularly valued the simulated learning and reflective elements of the module. The results of the study suggest that more staff should have access to education and training to enable practitioners to work more effectively with families. However, they will need to have support mechanisms in practice to effectively implement family interventions.",Facilitators and barriers to education for chiropractic students with visual impairment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31021671,The Journal of chiropractic education,2019 05 13,The purpose of this study was to document the academic experiences of students with visual impairment in a doctor of chiropractic program.

Nowadays, more than 90% of patients are cured and overall survival is nearly 100% at 5 years. Efforts have been made to avoid related effects of therapies; therefore, children are treated using different chemotherapy schemes in comparison with adults. Areas covered: This review includes a view of the clinical classification and risk assessment in children suffering from HL. The chemotherapy more commonly employed is revisited. The use of PET/CT to evaluate the disease in order to guide therapy is analyzed. New options of chemotherapy and emerging immunotherapy are also included. Expert opinion: In order to make the right treatment choice, a proper initial assessment of risk is mandatory. The choice of therapy in these kinds of patients must be done according to the experience of the team, and also, the cost and logistics related to the eligible scheme are very important. If possible, efforts must be made to include PET/CT in guiding therapy and avoiding overtreatment and long-term adverse effects in children.

All participants completed the K-TPFQ, and the Korean versions of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index ( Buysse, Reynolds, Monk, Berman, & Kupfer, 1989 ; Sohn, Kim, Lee, & Cho, 2012 ), the Beck Depression Inventory ( Beck, Ward, Mendelson, Mock, & Erbaugh, 1961 ; Jo, Park, Jo, Ryu, & Han, 2007 ), the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory questionnaire ( Cho & Choi, 1989 ; Spielberger & Gorsuch, 1983 ), and the Tinnitus Handicap Questionnaire ( Kuk, Tyler, Russell, & Jordan, 1990 ). Results The K-TPFQ exhibited good or high internal consistency and reliability (Cronbach's alpha range: .91-.95, item-total correlation range: .50-.82). The total score derived from the items of the K-TPFQ and its subcategories was moderately correlated with that of questionnaires that measure similar parameters (Pearson correlation coefficient range: .50-.79). Conclusions Overall, the results of this study indicate that the K-TPFQ is reliable and valid.

Additionally, we compared the verbal responses associated with the 2 display types to determine whether adults with TBI tended to produce more action or naming messages. Method Thirteen adults with and 13 without TBI viewed grid and visual scene displays matched for content and theme. They then provided verbal responses stating the theme or central idea of each image. Results Although no significant differences were noted between groups for theme identification accuracy, adults with TBI required significantly more time than adults without TBI to process both display types. Both participant groups more rapidly and accurately identified visual scenes than grid displays. Additionally, participants with and without TBI produced more action messages in response to visual scenes and naming messages in response to grid displays. Conclusions This investigation provides preliminary evidence that themes that depicted visual scenes maybe more rapidly and accurately identified than those depicted in grid displays. Additionally, visual scenes may more effectively represent action messages, and grids may more effectively represent naming messages for people with TBI.",Associations between pain catastrophizing and clinical characteristics in adults with substance use disorders and co-occurring chronic pain.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31021654,The American journal of drug and alcohol abuse,2019 04 25,"Pain catastrophizing refers to the tendency to interpret pain as harmful, intolerable, or uncontrollable.

Physical rehabilitation is standard practice following a period of disuse, yet mobility may be severely compromised, and recovery is commonly delayed or incomplete in special populations. Thus, a novel approach toward recovery of muscle mass is highly desired. Pericytes [neuron-glial antigen 2 (NG2)+CD31-CD45- (Lineage- [Lin-]) and CD146+Lin-] demonstrate capacity to facilitate muscle repair, yet the ability to enhance myofiber growth following disuse is unknown. In the current study, 3-4-mo-old mice were unilaterally immobilized for 14 d (IM) or immobilized for 14 d followed by 14 d of remobilization (RE). Flow cytometry and targeted gene expression analyses were completed to assess pericyte quantity and function following IM and RE. In addition, a transplantation study was conducted to assess the impact of pericytes on recovery. Results from targeted analyses suggest minimal impact of disuse on pericyte gene expression, yet NG2+Lin- pericyte quantity is reduced following IM (P < 0.05). Remarkably, pericyte transplantation recovered losses in myofiber cross-sectional area and the capillary-to-fiber ratio following RE, whereas deficits remained with vehicle alone (P = 0.01). These findings provide the first evidence that pericytes effectively rehabilitate skeletal muscle mass following disuse atrophy.-Munroe, M., Dvoretskiy, S., Lopez, A., Leong, J., Dyle, M.

However, structural details for understanding the nature of the molecular contacts and mechanistic roles in various physicochemical and thermodynamic events often remain unclear. This study provides a spectroscopic characterization of posaconazole (POSA) formulations, a second-generation triazole antifungal drug (Noxafil, Merck & Co., Inc., Kenilworth, NJ, USA), at molecular resolution. One- and two-dimensional (2D) solid-state NMR (ssNMR) techniques including spectral editing, heteronuclear 1H-13C, 19F-13C, 15N-13C, and 19F-1H polarization transfer, and spin correlation and ultrafast magic angle spinning, together with the isotopic labeling strategy, were utilized to uncover molecular details in POSA ASDs in a site-specific manner. Active groups in triazole and difluorophenyl rings exhibited rich but distinct categories of interactions with two polymers, hypromellose acetate succinate and hypromellose phthalate, including intermolecular O-H···O═C and O-H···F-C hydrogen bonding, π-π aromatic packing, and electrostatic interaction. Interestingly, the chlorine-to-fluorine substituent in POSA, one of the major structural differences from itraconazole that could facilitate binding to the biological target, offers an additional contact with the polymer. These findings exhibit 2D ssNMR as a sensitive technique for probing sub-nanometer structures of pharmaceutical materials and provide a structural basis for optimizing the type and strength of drug-polymer interactions in the design of amorphous formulations.",Self-Powered Pressure- and Vibration-Sensitive Tactile Sensors for Learning Technique-Based Neural Finger Skin.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31021638,Nano letters,2019 05 28,"Finger skin electronics are essential for realizing humanoid soft robots and/or medical applications that are very similar to human appendages. A selective sensitivity to pressure and vibration that are indispensable for tactile sensing is highly desirable for mimicking sensory mechanoreceptors in skin. Additionally, for a human-machine interaction, output signals of a skin sensor should be highly correlated to human neural spike signals. As a demonstration of fully mimicking the skin of a human finger, we propose a self-powered flexible neural tactile sensor (NTS) that mimics all the functions of human finger skin and that is selectively and sensitively activated by either pressure or vibration stimuli with laminated independent sensor elements. A sensor array of ultrahigh-density pressure (20 × 20 pixels on 4 cm2) of interlocked percolative graphene films is fabricated to detect pressure and its distribution by mimicking slow adaptive (SA) mechanoreceptors in human skin. A triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) was laminated on the sensor array to detect high-frequency vibrations like fast adaptive (FA) mechanoreceptors, as well as produce electric power by itself. Importantly, each output signal for the SA- and FA-mimicking sensors was very similar to real neural spike signals produced by SA and FA mechanoreceptors in human skin, thus making it easy to convert the sensor signals into neural signals that can be perceived by humans. By introducing microline patterns on the top surface of the NTS to mimic structural and functional properties of a human fingerprint, the integrated NTS device was capable of classifying 12 fabrics possessing complex patterns with 99.1% classification accuracy.",Divergent Hammett Plots of the Ground- and Excited-State Proton Transfer Reactions of 7-Substituted-2-Naphthol Compounds.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31021637,The journal of physical chemistry. B,2019 05 16,"The rational design of photoacids requires accessible predictive models of the electronic effect of functional groups on chemical templates of interest. Here, the effect of substituents on the photoacidity and excited-state proton transfer (PT) pathways of prototype 2-naphthol (2OH) at the symmetric C7 position was investigated through photochemical and computational studies of 7-amino-2-naphthol (7N2OH) and 7-methoxy-2-naphthol (7OMe2OH). Time-resolved emission experiments of 7N2OH revealed that the presence of an electron-withdrawing versus electron-donating group (EWG vs EDG, NH3+ vs NH2) led to a drastic decline in photoacidity: p Ka* = 1.1 ± 0.2 vs 9.6 ± 0.2. Time-dependent density functional theory calculations with explicit water molecules confirmed that the excited neutral state (x = NH2) is greatly stabilized by water, with equation-of-motion coupled cluster singles and doubles calculations supporting potential mixing between the La and Lb states. Similar suppression of photoacidity, however, was not observed for 7OMe2OH with EDG OCH3, p Ka* = 2.7 ± 0.1. Hammett plots of the ground- and excited-state PT reactions of substituted 7-x-2OH compounds (x = CN, NH3+, H, CH3, OCH3, OH, and NH2) vs Hammett parameters σp showed breaks in the linearity between the EDG and EWG regions: ρ ∼ 0 vs 1.14 and ρ* ∼ 0 vs 3.86.

The catalysts structural properties are dynamically changing as they perform via complex phenomenon dependent on the reaction conditions. In turn, not just the structural features but even more importantly, catalytic characteristics of nanoparticles get altered. Definitive conclusions about these phenomena are not possible with imaging of random nanoparticles with unknown atomic structure history. Using a contemporary PtCu-alloy electrocatalyst as a model system, a unique approach allowing unprecedented insight into the morphological dynamics on the atomic-scale caused by the process of dealloying is presented. Observing the detailed structure and morphology of the same nanoparticle at different stages of electrochemical treatment reveals new insights into atomic-scale processes such as size, faceting, strain and porosity development. Furthermore, based on precise atomically resolved microscopy data, Kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulations provide further feedback into the physical parameters governing electrochemically induced structural dynamics. This work introduces a unique approach toward observation and understanding of nanoparticles dynamic changes on the atomic level and paves the way for an understanding of the structure-stability relationship.","Study of Benzene Fragmentation, Isomerization, and Growth Using Microwave Spectroscopy.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31021635,The journal of physical chemistry letters,2019 05 16,"Using a combination of broadband and cavity Fourier transform microwave spectroscopies, and newly developed analysis and assignment tools, the discharge products of benzene have been extensively studied in the 2-18 GHz frequency range.

A,2019 05 23,"Approaches for using diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) to evaluate matrix elements involving two vibrational wave functions are explored. In the first part of this study, overlaps between a wave function obtained using DMC and one that can be calculated analytically are evaluated. In this case, the analytical wave function is used as the guiding function for an importance sampled DMC simulation. The accuracy of the calculated overlaps is found to depend strongly on the accuracy of the calculated descendant weights, which are obtained in the DMC simulation. While a single evaluation of the descendant weights is sufficient for obtaining projected probability amplitudes or expectation values of multiplicative operators, averages of multiple independent evaluations of the descendant weights are required to obtain accurate matrix elements. This approach is investigated for one-dimensional model systems as well as H2CO, H2D+, and D2H+. The approach is extended to the evaluation of matrix elements of the dipole moment operator between the ground state and states with one quantum of excitation in one of the OH stretching vibrations in H3O2-. For these calculations, the wave functions for both the ground and excited states are evaluated using DMC.

Here, a large new family of 2D materials is found from metal hydrides by high-throughput computational search augmented with first-principles calculations. There are 110 thermally and dynamically stable 2D materials that range from metallic materials to wide-gap semiconductors. A subgroup of these materials even varies from topological insulators to nodal-loop semimetals as well as from antiferromagnetic semiconductors to ferromagnetic half-metals. Unexpectedly, these monolayers resemble graphene in an ability to form weak interlayer interaction due to the variable multicenter bonding of hydrogen that eliminates the otherwise prevalent dangling bonds, rather than the covalent bonds between stacked layers as in previously reported synthetic 2D materials. This feature will favor potential experimental synthesis of these metal hydride monolayers.",Current Review of the Modulatory Effects of LED Lights on Photosynthesis of Secondary Metabolites and Future Perspectives of Microgreen Vegetables.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31021630,Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,2019 06 10,"Light-emitting diode (LED) lights have recently been applied in controlled environment agriculture toward growing vegetables of various assortments, including microgreens.

In particular, 1 exhibits a stronger photoelectric response in a wider optical region compared to that of 2, and the ""on/off"" ratio of conductivity of 1 is estimated to ∼300 under sunlight illumination. Density functional theory calculation discloses that different inorganic motifs make greater contributions to their electronic structure and photoelectric response. It is believed that the heteromorphic method allows a potential pathway for construction of new lead-free hybrid materials as light absorbers for photoelectric application.",Leveraging a Low-Affinity Diazaspiro Orthosteric Fragment to Reduce Dopamine D3 Receptor (D3R) Ligand Promiscuity across Highly Conserved Aminergic G-Protein-Coupled Receptors (GPCRs).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31021617,Journal of medicinal chemistry,2019 05 23,"Previously, we reported a 3-(2-methoxyphenyl)-9-(3-((4-methyl-5-phenyl-4 H-1,2,4-triazol-3-yl)thio)propyl)-3,9-diazaspiro[5.5]undecane (1) compound with excellent dopamine D3 receptor (D3R) affinity (D3R Ki = 12.0 nM) and selectivity (D2R/D3R ratio = 905). Herein, we present derivatives of 1 with comparable D3R affinity (32, D3R Ki = 3.2 nM, D2R/D3R ratio = 60) and selectivity (30, D3R Ki = 21.0 nM, D2R/D3R ratio = 934). Fragmentation of 1 revealed orthosteric fragment 5a to express an unusually low D3R affinity ( Ki = 2.7 μM). Compared to piperazine congener 31, which retains a high-affinity orthosteric fragment (5d, D3R Ki = 23.9 nM), 1 was found to be more selective for the D3R among D1- and D2-like receptors and exhibited negligible off-target interactions at serotoninergic and adrenergic G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), common off-target sites for piperazine-containing D3R scaffolds. This study provides a unique rationale for implementing weakly potent orthosteric fragments into D3R ligand systems to minimize drug promiscuity at other aminergic GPCR sites.",Cobalt- and Nickel-Containing Germanotungstates Based on Open Wells-Dawson Structure: Synthesis and Characterization of Tetrameric Anion.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31021616,Inorganic chemistry,2019 05 21,"Two transition-metal-substituted compounds K10H10{[Co(H2O)2]2[Co(H2O)3]2(Ge4W36O130)}·32H2O (1Co) and K10H10{[Ni(H2O)2]2[Ni(H2O)3]2(Ge4W36O130)}·32H2O (2Ni), have been successfully synthesized, both of which consist of the S-shaped tetrameric structure {Ge4W36} constructed from trivacant Keggin-type germanotungstate precursor K8Na2[ A-α-GeW9O34]·25H2O.

However, numerous MOFs have poor chemical stability, significantly restricting their industrial application. The introduction of trifluoromethyl groups around clusters of MOFs results in a shielding effect caused by their hydrophobicity and bulkiness, thus preventing guest molecules from attacking the coordination bonds. To prove such a shielding effect, the position of the trifluoromethyl groups is rationally adjusted, with trifluoromethyl groups at the ortho positions of carboxyl groups significantly improving the chemical stability of UiO-67. The prepared UiO-67- o-2CF3 remains intact after treatment with boiling water, 8 M HCl, 10 mM NaOH, and 50 ppm of NaF aqueous solutions. As the control experiment, trifluoromethyl groups at the meta positions of carboxyl groups have no shielding effect; hence, UiO-67- m-2CF3 has a stability that is lower than that of UiO-67- o-2CF3. In addition, the shielding effect is also applied to other MOFs, including DUT-5- o-2CF3 and Al-TPDC- o-2CF3, confirming the universality of this strategy.",China Electricity Generation Greenhouse Gas Emission Intensity in 2030: Implications for Electric Vehicles.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31021614,Environmental science & technology,2019 05 23,"Electrification of transportation offers clear national energy security benefits but unclear climate benefits. With the current heterogeneity of grid electricity mix in China, greenhouse gas (GHG) benefits of battery electric vehicles (BEVs) vary dramatically with location. Currently, compared to baseline conventional gasoline vehicles, BEVs in north and northeastern Chinese provinces have very modest (∼10-20%) well-to-wheel (WTW) GHG benefits, whereas BEVs in southern provinces have substantial benefits (∼50%). With the expected transition to a more renewable electricity mix documented here, regional effects will largely disappear and the benefits of BEVs will be substantial (∼60-70% lower than current internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs) and ∼10-40% lower than 2030 advanced hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs)) across the whole of China by 2030.

The 3'-end of the RNA contains two unpaired nucleotides (3'-overhang) that interact with the PAZ (PIWI/Argonaute/Zwille) domain of the protein. Theoretical and experimental evidence points toward a direct connection between the PAZ/3'-overhang binding affinity and siRNA's potency and specificity. Among the challenges to overcome when deploying siRNA molecules as therapeutics are their ready degradation under physiological conditions and off-target effects. It has been demonstrated that nuclease resistance can be improved via replacement of the dinucleotide overhang by small molecules which retain the interactions of the RNA guide strand with the PAZ domain. Most commonly, nucleotide analogues are used to substitute the siRNA overhang. However, in this study we adopt a de novo approach to its modification. The X-ray structure of human Argonaute-2 PAZ domain served to perform virtual screening and molecular interaction energy profiling (i.e., decomposition of the force field calculated protein-ligand interaction energies) of tailored-to-purpose fragment libraries. The binding of fragments to the PAZ domain was validated experimentally by NMR spectroscopy. The in silico guided protocol led to the efficient discovery of a number of PAZ domain ligands with affinities comparable to that of a reference dinucleotide (UpU, Kd = 33 μM). Originally starting from a generic fragment library, hits progress from 930 μM down to 14 μM within three iterations for the fragments selected via in silico molecular interaction energy profiling from a bespoke library. These dinucleotide siRNA guide strand surrogates represent potential new siRNA-based therapeutics (when attached to siRNA to form bioconjugates) featuring improved efficacy, specificity, stability, and cellular uptake. This project yielded a portfolio of seven patent applications, four of which have been granted to date.",Mechanistic Insight into the Effect of Metal Ions on Photogeneration of Reactive Species from Dissolved Organic Matter.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31021612,Environmental science & technology,2019 05 23,"The photogeneration of reactive species (RS) from dissolved organic matter (DOM) exhibits a great impact on the attenuation of pollutants in natural waters. However, the effect of metal ions on the photogeneration of excited triplet-state DOM (3DOM*), singlet oxygen (1O2), and hydroxyl radical (•OH) by effluent organic matter (EfOM), fulvic acid (FA), and humic acid (HA) is poorly understood. Here, we provided the first evidence that the quenching of 3DOM* was positively correlated with the complexation capacity of metal ions with DOM. Generally, the paramagnetic metal ions (Cr3+, Mn2+, Fe3+, and Cu2+) exhibited higher conditional stability constants (log KML) with DOM and stronger inhibition for RS than the others (Mg2+, Ca2+, Al3+, and Zn2+). For DOM of different sources, the metal binding capacity increased in the order of EfOM < HA < FA and the humic substances were more susceptible to metal ions. The inhibition was attributed to both static and dynamic quenching of 3DOM* by metal ions. The dynamic quenching rate constants of metal ions for 3DOM* were estimated as ∼109 M-1 s-1, which was positively related to the corresponding log KML. These findings highlight crucial links between metal-DOM complexation and 3DOM* quenching and, consequently, the inhibition of RS.","Gridded Emissions of CO, NO x, SO2, CO2, NH3, HCl, CH4, PM2.5, PM10, BC, and NMVOC from Open Municipal Waste Burning in India.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31021611,Environmental science & technology,2019 05 07,"Accurate emission inventories serve as critical inputs for air quality and climate models but are poorly constrained over India.

Out of the 216 (201-232) Tg y-1 of waste produced in the year 2015, 68 (45-105) Tg y-1 was burned in the open. To determine emissions from waste burning, emission factors of 59 non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs), CH4, CO2, CO, and NO x were measured from garbage fires in rural and urban sites in India. The NMVOC emissions from open waste burning of 1.4-2 Tg y-1 increase India's total anthropogenic NMVOC budget by 8-12%, while BC emissions (40-110 Ggy-1) increase the total anthropogenic BC emissions by 8-12%. Open waste burning in India emits 3-7 Tg y-1 of CO and 58-130 Tg y-1 of CO2. Emissions increase the total anthropogenic CO and CO2 in the MIX-Asia inventory by 4-11% and 2-6%, respectively.

These interactions are therefore widely probed in both basic studies and drug development to enhance or interrupt them. Here, we designed a high-throughput publicly available platform for visualization and selection of eukaryotic cells according to the specificity of surface-exposed receptors by consolidation of phage display and flow cytometry techniques. Polypeptide ligands for membrane receptors are incorporated into every copy of p3 protein of M13K07 bacteriophage, which is intracellularly biotinylated to further accept PE-Cy7-labled streptavidin. Transgenic antigen-specific B-cells expressing membrane-tethered lymphoid B-cell receptor in a single-chain format interacted with engineered bacteriophages exposing the polypeptide ligand with an unprecedented selectivity of 97% and a false-positive detection value of 2.0%. Multivalent binding of the phage bioconjugates with the receptor provided significantly better specificity and sensitivity allowing application of engineered bacteriophage bioconjugates at a concentration 3 orders of magnitude lower in comparison with synthetic biotinylated peptide. We suggest that the platform described in this work may be applied either for routine staining or characterization of orphan membrane receptors exposed on the surface of living mammalian cells in their native environment."

Despite enormous clinical potential, the mechanism of action is controversial. To investigate the mechanism of ONC201 and identify compounds with improved potency, we tested a series of novel ONC201 analogues (TR compounds) for effects on cell viability and stress responses in breast and other cancer models. The TR compounds were found to be ∼50-100 times more potent at inhibiting cell proliferation and inducing the integrated stress response protein ATF4 than ONC201. Using immobilized TR compounds, we identified the human mitochondrial caseinolytic protease P (ClpP) as a specific binding protein by mass spectrometry. Affinity chromatography/drug competition assays showed that the TR compounds bound ClpP with ∼10-fold higher affinity compared to ONC201. Importantly, we found that the peptidase activity of recombinant ClpP was strongly activated by ONC201 and the TR compounds in a dose- and time-dependent manner with the TR compounds displaying a ∼10-100 fold increase in potency over ONC201. Finally, siRNA knockdown of ClpP in SUM159 cells reduced the response to ONC201 and the TR compounds, including induction of CHOP, loss of the mitochondrial proteins (TFAM, TUFM), and the cytostatic effects of these compounds. Thus, we report that ClpP directly binds ONC201 and the related TR compounds and is an important biological target for this class of molecules. Moreover, these studies provide, for the first time, a biochemical basis for the difference in efficacy between ONC201 and the TR compounds.",Low-Temperature Charging Dynamics of the Ionic Liquid and Its Gating Effect on FeSe0.5Te0.5 Superconducting Films.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31021595,ACS applied materials & interfaces,2019 05 17,"Ionic liquids (ILs) have been investigated extensively because of their unique ability to form the electric double layer (EDL), which induces high electrical field.

Here, we report our investigation of the low-temperature charging dynamics in two widely used ILs-DEME-TF2N and C4mim-TF2N. Results show that the formation of the EDL at ∼220 K requires several hours relative to milliseconds at room temperature, and an equivalent voltage Ve is introduced as a measure of the EDL formation during the biasing process. The experimental observation is supported by molecular dynamics simulation, which shows that the dynamics are logically a function of gate voltage, time, and temperature. To demonstrate the importance of understanding the charging dynamics, a 140 nm thick FeSe0.5Te0.5 film was biased using the DEME IL, showing a tunable Tc between 18 and 35 K.

The switch is composed of a positive feedback loop involving a novel transcription factor and can be switched ON and OFF via two different transient inducer inputs. By further coupling the bistable switch with an antibiotic resistance gene, we obtained a growth differentiation circuit, where yeast cells can be switched to stable HIGH or LOW growth rate states via transient inducer inputs.

Materiales y métodos. Se hizo un estudio comparado de las políticas públicas en Estados Unidos y el Reino Unido, las cuales representan casos extremos de la tamización neonatal. Con base en las similitudes y las diferencias, se interpretó la influencia de los principios bioéticos. Con esta información, se indicaron en la normatividad colombiana sobre tamización neonatal las consideraciones bioéticas pertinentes. Resultados. En el Reino Unido prevalece la autonomía de los padres, lo que ocasiona riesgos al no cumplirse con las acciones obligatorias de beneficencia. En los Estados Unidos prevalece la beneficencia, con un amplio y obligatorio cubrimiento de anomalías sujetas a tamización, lo cual incrementa la probabilidad de falsos positivos y ocasiona un alto costo de oportunidad. Hay similitudes entre los procedimientos de los dos países que también están parcialmente contemplados en Colombia, como la pretensión de equidad en el acceso.

Validar la escala EMUN-AR usando el modelo de Rasch. Materiales y métodos. La escala EMUN-AR mide 26 ítems que evalúan por dimensiones los síntomas de la enfermedad maníaco-depresiva en tres categorías: frecuencia, intensidad y grado de molestia causada. Para evaluar las propiedades psicométricas de la escala, se efectuaron análisis factoriales exploratorios con el fin de tener una aproximación de su estructura latente, y se usaron modelos de Rasch que incluyeron la 'unidimensionalidad', la confiabilidad, el ajuste de ítems, el ordenamiento de umbrales, y los mapas de personas e ítems. Resultados. Se seleccionó una muestra de 267 pacientes hospitalizados, 204 de los cuales había sufrido un episodio maníaco (76,4 %) y estaba recibiendo tratamiento farmacológico. Se encontró una estructura factorial que puede resumirse en cuatro dominios: activación, inhibición, ideas depresivas e inadaptación. El análisis de Rasch evidenció la unidimensionalidad en los factores, adecuados valores de confiabilidad, buen ajuste de los 26 ítems en general (excepto en el ítem que mide las ideas de muerte o suicidio), un funcionamiento deficiente del sistema de calificación de los ítems y un cubrimiento limitado de los síntomas de la enfermedad correspondientes a las formas atenuadas.

La aplicación del diseño pedagógico con estos propósitos en la educación en cirugía, ha sido limitada. Objetivos. Presentar los resultados de una estrategia pedagógica para integrar la enseñanza de la cirugía con las humanidades con base en el modelo teórico de aprendizaje cognitivo, y evaluar su asociación con las percepciones de los estudiantes en torno al aprendizaje. Materiales y métodos. Se desarrolló un diseño pedagógico para la enseñanza de condiciones clínicas en cirugía utilizando recursos de las humanidades médicas. Se evaluaron las percepciones estudiantiles en torno al soporte y la articulación ofrecidos por los profesores para la integración de ambas disciplinas, así como en torno a su propio aprendizaje mediante cuestionarios validados. Se utilizaron modelos de regresión lineal para evaluar la asociación propuesta. Resultados. Se incluyeron 216 estudiantes en el análisis y se obtuvieron altos promedios en cada una de las variables. Por cada unidad adicional atribuida al soporte y la articulación desplegadas por los profesores para integrar ambas disciplinas, la percepción del aprendizaje (b) aumentó en 0,45 (IC95% 30-0,60) y en 0,40 (IC95% 25-55) (coeficiente de determinación múltiple -R2=0,64, p<0,001), respectivamente. Conclusiones. Las estrategias educativas centradas en las técnicas de soporte y articulación orientadas a integrar las humanidades médicas y la cirugía en el proceso de enseñanza, se asociaron positivamente con las percepciones de los estudiantes sobre el aprendizaje. Se requieren nuevos estudios que evalúen los efectos de estas intervenciones en el aprendizaje y la memoria a largo plazo.","Risk factors associated with the metabolic syndrome in Cali, Colombia (2013): A case-control study.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31021546,Biomedica : revista del Instituto Nacional de Salud,2019 04 25,"In 2016, the World Health Organization reported that more than 2 billion adults were overweight, of whom 600 million were obese, 347 million had diabetes mellitus type II, and people with hypertension had increased from 600 million in 1980 to 1 billion in 2010. Additionally, 20% of the world's adult population will develop metabolic syndrome during their lifespan with tremendous effects for their wellbeing and the health systems.","Psychometric properties and validity of the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) in a population attending an HIV clinic in Cali, Colombia.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31021545,Biomedica : revista del Instituto Nacional de Salud,2019 04 25,"Depression in people living with HIV/AIDS is associated with poor health outcomes.

La paciente era una mujer de 21 años de edad con fractura cerrada de húmero y fémur izquierdos, que presentó un síndrome de embolia grasa, neumotórax izquierdo e hipertensión pulmonar, en las primeras 24 horas después de un accidente. Estuvo hospitalizada un mes y quedó con varios déficits neurológicos centrales, como infartos 'lacunares' y necrosis cortical laminar occipital, así como limitaciones en la bipedestación, la marcha, la visión y las funciones cognitivas. A partir del primer mes después del alta hospitalaria, se comenzó un proceso integral de rehabilitación neurológica y cognitiva en casa, y posteriormente, en una unidad médica de rehabilitación. Durante los primeros dos años después del accidente, la paciente recibió estimulación sensorial, sensoperceptiva y motora, así como rehabilitación motora y visual intensiva. Una vez se recuperó físicamente, se inició un proceso de rehabilitación neuropsicológica. Seis años después del accidente, la paciente terminó sus estudios universitarios y hoy está laboralmente activa. El proceso de rehabilitación neurológica es complejo, individual y difícil, aunque no imposible, y no se puede estandarizar un patrón de recuperación para todos los pacientes. Si bien existe la recuperación espontánea, la cual se da en los primeros seis meses, el caso aquí reportado demuestra que, en la fase crónica, la recuperación se puede lograr, pero requiere de evaluaciones y técnicas coordinadas de rehabilitación neurológica."
