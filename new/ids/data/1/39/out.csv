Despite an obligatory role in porcine reproductive and respiratory virus (PRRSV) infection, information on sCD163 as a biomarker of disease outcome in swine remains limited. In the present study, we developed a sandwich ELISA using an anti-bovine CD163 antibody, LND68A, in conjunction with the porcine specific 2A10/11 antibody. The ELISA demonstrated that CD163 shedding from porcine alveolar macrophages increased following in vitro exposure to lipopolysaccharide or PRRSV-2 strain NVSL 97-7895. Evaluation of serum sCD163 in healthy feeder pigs identified a significant age effect with concentration rising after birth to a peak at day 19 (P < 0.05) followed by a sharp decline to a minimal level of detection at 9 weeks of age (P < 0.05). Healthy sows showed substantial variation but no significant change in average concentration between early and late lactation. The serum concentration of sCD163 from pigs with homozygous gene edits disrupting translation of the CD163 protein was below the threshold of detection. However, when reformatted as a competitive ELISA the assay identified an interfering substance consistent with the release of a truncated form of the CD163 protein in sera from gene edited animals. With sCD163 shown to be both dynamic and responsive, the described ELISA represents a novel tool for investigation of this molecule as a potential biomarker of disease response in the pig.",Intestinal colonization and acute immune response in commercial turkeys following inoculation with Campylobacter jejuni constructs encoding antibiotic-resistance markers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30947981,Veterinary immunology and immunopathology,2019 04 22,"Consumption of contaminated poultry products is one of the main sources of human campylobacteriosis, of which Campylobacter jejuni subsp. jejuni (C. jejuni) is responsible for approximately 90% of the cases. At slaughter, the ceca of commercial chickens and turkeys are the main anatomical site where C. jejuni asymptomatically colonizes. We have previously colonized commercial turkey poults with different isolates of C. jejuni and evaluated different media to best enumerate Campylobacter from intestinal samples, but the host-response is unknown in turkeys. Enumeration of Campylobacter (colony forming units (cfu)/gram of intestinal contents) can be challenging, and can be confounded if animals are colonized with multiple species of Campylobacter. In order to precisely enumerate the C. jejuni isolate used to experimentally colonize turkeys, constructs of C. jejuni (NCTC 11,168) were tagged with different antibiotic resistance markers at the CmeF locus (chloramphenicol (CjCm) or kanamycin (CjK)). We sought to examine the kinetics of intestinal colonization using the antibiotic resistant constructs, and characterize the immune response in cecal tissue of turkeys. In vitro analysis of the tagged antibiotic-resistant constructs demonstrated no changes in motility, morphology, or adherence and invasion of INT-407 cells compared to the parent isolate NCTC 11,168. Two animal experiments were completed to evaluate intestinal colonization by the constructs. In experiment 1, three-week old poults were colonized after oral gavage for 14 days, and CjCm and CjK cfu were recovered from cecal, but not ileal contents. In experiment 2, nine-week old poults were orally inoculated with CjCm, and the abundance of CjCm cfu/g of cecal contents significantly decreased beyond 14 days after inoculation. Significant lesions were detected in CjCm colonized poults at day 2 post-colonization. Using immunohistochemistry, Campylobacter antigen was detected in between cecal villi by day 7 of CjCm colonized poults. Quantitative RT-PCR of CjCm-colonized cecal tissue demonstrated significant down-regulation of IL-1β, IL-10 and IL-13 mRNA, and significant up-regulation of IL-6, IL-8, IL-17 A, IL-22 and IFNγ mRNA on day 2, and for some on day 7 post-colonization. All differentially expressed genes were similar to mock-infected poults by day 14. These data suggest that C. jejuni induced a brief inflammatory response in the cecum of poults that quickly resolved. Results from this study provide valuable insight into host-response and persistent colonization of the turkey cecum. These findings will help to develop and test strategies to promote food safety in commercial turkeys.",Avian pathogenic Escherichia coli infection of a chicken lung epithelial cell line.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30947980,Veterinary immunology and immunopathology,2019 04 22,"Virulent strains of Escherichia coli (Avian Pathogenic E. Coli: APEC) can cause initial infection of the respiratory tract in chickens potentially leading to systemic infection called colibacillosis, which remains a major cause of economic losses in the poultry industry. The role of epithelial lung cells as first targets of APEC and in initiating the innate immune response is unclear and was investigated in this study. APEC was able to adhere and subsequently invade cells from the chicken lung epithelial CLEC213 cell line exhibiting pneumocyte type II-like characteristics. Invasion was confirmed using confocal microscopy after infection with GFP-labelled APEC. Moreover, the infection resulted in a significant increase in IL-8 gene expression, a chemo-attractant of macrophages and heterophils. Gene expression of interferon α and β were not significantly upregulated and chicken Surfactant Protein A, also did not show a significant upregulation on either gene or protein level. The immune response of CLEC213 cells towards APEC was shown to be similar to stimulation with E. coli LPS. These results establish CLEC213 cells as a novel model system for studying bacterial infection of the lung epithelium and show that these cells may play a role in the initial innate response towards bacterial pathogens.",Flow-cytometric analysis of circulating leukocyte populations in turkeys: Establishment of a whole blood analysis approach and investigations on possible influencing factors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30947979,Veterinary immunology and immunopathology,2019 04 22,"The blood cell counting methods used for diagnostic and research purposes in turkeys are, up to date, inferior to the techniques established for mammals and chickens. While microscopic counts are time consuming, previous flow cytometric approaches did not cover all blood cell types of interest due to the lack of turkey-specific markers for the different cell populations. Moreover, it is unknown to what extent the different leukocyte populations are affected by host and environmental factors including age, breed of the bird, and housing environment, respectively. In this study we established a whole blood based flow cytometric analysis method for turkeys. This method was used to determine baseline values depending on the age of the birds as well as under consideration of variations between trials and animal room effects. During three trials whole blood samples of B.U.T. 6 female turkeys were collected to analyze different leukocyte concentrations (cells/μl whole blood). In the first trial one group and in the second and third trial two groups with 22 birds/group were housed. Blood samples were collected at days one, 23, 43, 60, and 88 post hatch and concentrations of monocytes, MHC class II-positive, CD4+, and CD8+ lymphocytes, as well as thrombocytes and granulocytes were determined by flow cytometric analysis. Concentrations of all identified populations were not only influenced by the bird's age (p < 0.05), they varied also among trials (p < 0.05) and even for some of the populations between animal rooms within the same trial despite comparable housing and management conditions. Therefore, for the establishment of baseline values for leucocyte concentrations in whole blood effects of age and housing have to be considered. In addition, our data emphasize the importance of the establishment of baseline values for different age groups, as age had the strongest effect on the blood cell numbers in this study.",The effect of age on foal monocyte-derived dendritic cell (MoDC) maturation and function after exposure to killed bacteria.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30947978,Veterinary immunology and immunopathology,2019 04 22,"Neonatal foals are uniquely susceptible to certain infections early in life. Dendritic cells (DC) are vital in the transition between the innate and adaptive immune response to infection, but DC biology in foals is not fully characterized. Monocyte-derived DC represent a suitable in vitro model similar to DC that differentiate from monocytes recruited from circulation. We hypothesized that foal monocyte-derived DC (MoDC) would exhibit age-dependent phenotypic and functional differences compared to adult horse MoDC. MoDC generated from 9 horses (collected once) and from 8 foals (collected at 1, 7, and 30 days-of-age) were exposed to killed whole cell Escherichia coli or Staphylococcus aureus bacteria. MoDC expression of MHC class II (MHC class-II), CD86, and CD14 were measured by flow cytometry, and supernatant cytokine concentrations of IL-4, IL-17, IFN-γ, and IL-10 were quantified with a validated immunoassay. The percentage of MoDC expressing MHC class-II and CD86 was lower and CD14 was higher for cells generated from 1-day-old foals compared to cells generated from adult horses (P < 0.0001). Bacterial exposure increased the percentage of cells expressing CD86 at all ages (P < 0.0001). Bacteria-exposed MoDC from 1-day-old foals produced significantly less IL-4, IL-17, and IFN-γ than adult MoDC produced in response to bacterial exposure (P ≤ 0.04). Following bacterial exposure, foal MoDC phenotype and cytokine secretion were different than those of mature horses. These differences could reduce the ability of foals to generate a protective immune response against bacterial infection.","Heat stress, Eimeria spp. and C. perfringens infections alone or in combination modify gut Th1/Th2 cytokine balance and avian necrotic enteritis pathogenesis.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30947977,Veterinary immunology and immunopathology,2019 04 22,"Information on the dynamics of the chicken immune system during bacterial or parasite challenge in the presence or absence of stressful situations may provide a better understanding of the complex mechanisms behind these diseases. Necrotic enteritis (NE) had been controlled previously by the proper use of antimicrobial agents; however, more recently, NE has reemerged in many countries. The imposed restrictions on antimicrobial use and/or the intensive productive programs implemented by producers are challenges the birds, leading to large host adaptive responses that in many instances are like those elicited by stressors. This study analyses the effects of heat stress on Th1/Th2 cytokine balance, pathological features, and Toll-like receptor expression in the small intestine of broiler chickens infected with Clostridium perfringens type A in the presence or absence of Eimeria spp. co-infection. This co-infection model was experimentally used because it reproduces the findings commonly observed in the field during avian NE. For this purpose, broiler chickens infected with C. perfringens and/or Eimeria spp. were reared in isolator chambers subjected or not to heat stress intermittently. It was observed that heat stress directs the expression of Th2-type cytokines, increases Toll-like receptor 4 expression in the intestine and reduces the disease severity induced by Eimeria spp. and C. perfringens infections alone or in combination, most likely as a consequence of stress-induced changes in brain-gut axis activity.",Stocking density induces differential expression of immune-related genes in skeletal muscle and head kidney of fine flounder (Paralichthys adspersus).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30947976,Veterinary immunology and immunopathology,2019 04 22,"Immunity can be modulated by different internal and external factors, being stress one of the most important. However, the stress effects on the immunocompetence of the skeletal muscle has not been studied in detail in earlier vertebrates. Here, we examine the effect of chronic (4 and 7 weeks) crowding stress on the immunocompetence of skeletal muscle and head kidney in the fine flounder (Paralichthys adspersus). Corticosteroid receptor transcript levels and their target genes; pro-inflammatory cytokines, and Toll-, NOD-, and RIG-like receptors were quantified by qPCR. The results indicate that chronic stress down-regulates the expression of these genes in muscle, compromising skeletal muscle immunocompetence, while the expression of these genes is upregulated in head kidney after seven weeks of crowding stress. The data suggests that chronic stress modulates the expression of these immune-related genes in a tissue-specific manner.",Correlation between toll-like receptor 4 and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain 2 (NOD2) and pathological severity in dogs with chronic gastrointestinal diseases.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30947975,Veterinary immunology and immunopathology,2019 04 22,"Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain 2 (NOD2), and TNF-α play important roles in human inflammatory bowel diseases. The aim of this study was to elucidate the relationship between Toll-like receptor 4, NOD2, and TNF-α and the severity of chronic gastrointestinal diseases in dogs. We examined the expression levels of TLR4, NOD2, and TNF-α in the stomach, duodenum, ileum, colon, and rectum obtained from 21 dogs with chronic gastrointestinal disease, including inflammatory bowel disease, high-grade lymphoma, food responsive enteropathy, chronic pancreatitis, low-grade lymphoma, inflammatory colorectal polyp, and chronic colitis. Next, we demonstrated whether there is good correlation between the expression levels of TLR4, NOD2, and TNF-α and the histopathological analysis of each sample. We found that the level of TLR4 expression in the ileum of dogs with chronic gastrointestinal disease was positively associated with the histopathological severity. We also found that the level of NOD2 expression in the duodenum, stomach, and rectum was positively associated with the histopathological severity. However, there was no correlation between TNF-α expression in the 5 regions tested in this study and the histopathological severity. These findings indicate that TLR4 and NOD2 are remarkably associated with the severity of chronic gastrointestinal disease in dogs.","Modulation of TNF-α, IL-1Ra and IFN-γ in equine whole blood culture by glucocorticoids.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30947974,Veterinary immunology and immunopathology,2019 04 22,"Glucocorticoids are important drugs in the treatment of many inflammatory, autoimmune and allergic diseases in humans and animals. We investigated the effects of hydrocortisone and dexamethasone on TNF-α, IL-1Ra and INF-γ release in stimulated whole blood cell culture from healthy horses. Whole blood cell cultures proved to be useful for the characterization of the anti-inflammatory properties of new drugs. Diluted equine whole blood was exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and PCPwL (a cocktail consisting of phythemagglutinin E, concanavalin A, pokeweed mitogen and lipopolysaccharide) in the presence or absence of hydrocortisone and dexamethasone (10-12 - 10-5 M). TNF-α and IL-1Ra (LPS) as well as IFN-γ (PCPwL) levels were measured in the supernatants using specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The LPS-induced TNF-α and IL-1Ra as well as the PCPwL-induced IFN-γ levels were more potently suppressed by dexamethasone than by hydrocortisone in a concentration-dependent manner. Dexamethasone inhibited TNF-α, IL-1Ra and IFN-γ with the half maximal inhibition concentration (IC50) values of 0.09 μM, 0.453 μM and 0.001 μM, respectively, whereas hydrocortisone inhibited these cytokines with lower IC50 values of 1.45 μM, 2.96 μM and 0.09 μM, respectively. Our results suggest that the equine whole blood test system is useful and reliable to evaluate drug effects and immunological alterations and offers several advantages including simple and cheap performance in physiological and pathological conditions.",Brain Awareness and Conflict in Veterinary Medical Practice: What Happens and How to Deal with It.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30947973,The Veterinary clinics of North America.

Although MMCs are commonly used as biomarkers for anthropogenic exposure in many environmental monitoring programs, a substantial knowledge on characteristics of MMCs is required prior to the assessment of MMC responses. The present study was the first to determine the 3D structure of splenic MMCs of a fish from a number of consecutive histology sections by use of the Fiji and AutoCad software. Most splenic MMCs of shorthorn sculpins (Myoxocephalus scorpius) had spherical shape and limited variation in size (maximum diameter). We confirmed the close relationship between MMCs and blood vessels in spleen of shorthorn sculpins as 97% of investigated MMCs (60 whole MMCs over 510 μm thickness of the samples) were closely associated with splenic blood capillaries (mainly ellipsoids) at least once in a set of consecutive sections. In this paper, we describe variations in morphology, density, size, area, distribution, pigments and response to pathogens of MMC populations from different organs (spleen, kidney, liver, pancreas and gills). Additionally, we provide evidence suggesting the presence and dominance of pheomelanin in MMCs of shorthorn sculpins.",Expression of miR-210 mediated by adeno-associated virus performed neuroprotective effects on a rat model of acute spinal cord injury.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30947960,Tissue & cell,2019 04 05,"Acute spinal cord injuries (ASCI) are common neural disorders in traumatology medicine. MicroRNA-210 (miR-210) plays a crucial role in cell survival, endothelial cell migration and cell regeneration. This paper is aim to validate the pathophysiological function of miR-210 on ASCI. We built a rat model of ASCI and utilized an adeno-associated virus (rAAV)-expressing miR-210 for stable over-expression of miR-210. We tested in vivo miR-210 gain of function on ASCI by microinjected rAAV-miR-210 into the rat spinal cord. We further screened the targeting genes of miR-210 by PCR array and detected related signal proteins by Western Blot and qPCR. Over-expression of miR-210 protected neurons while neurologic function scores were improved. We further identified less TUNEL-positive cells, few features of apoptosis under electron microscopy, decreased activities of caspase-3 and 8 and increased vessel count in the spinal cord from rAAV-miR-210 group. We also found rAAV-miR-210 promoted expression of angiogenesis and metastasis-related protein (VEGF and Glut1) and regulated serum levels of inflammation-related cytokines. PCR screen array showed PTP1B, target of miR-210, was significantly down-regulated and Akt phosphorylation was significantly increased in rAAV-miR-210 group. The current data suggest that over-expression of miR-210 may target PTP1B and plays a neuroprotective role on rats after ASCI.","Immunophenotypic characterization, multi-lineage differentiation and aging of zebrafish heart and liver tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells as a novel approach in stem cell-based therapy.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30947959,Tissue & cell,2019 04 05,"Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are a good model for preclinical and clinical investigations, and alternative sources of MSCs are subject to intensive experiments. In this study, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were isolated from heart and liver tissue of Zebrafish (Danio rerio). The flow-cytometry as well as RT-PCR were used to analyze the expression of a panel of cell surface markers CD44, CD90, CD31 and CD34. In the following, alizarin red, oil red-O and toluidine blue staining were carried out to evaluate the multi-lineage differentiation of zebrafish heart and liver tissue-derived MSCs. Subsequently, the gene and protein expression of Oct4, Sox2 and Nanog as pluri-potent markers were analyzed by RT-PCR and western blotting, respectively. In addition, MTT assay was used for cell proliferation potential and population doubling time (PDT) assessment. Also, the aging of cells was investigated by β-galactosidase activity assay. The results showed that, like other MSCs, zebrafish heart and liver tissue-derived MSCs were positive for mesenchymal, negative for hematopoietic markers and expressed pluripotent markers Oct4, Sox2 and Nanog. Moreover, these cells were differentiated to osteocyte, adipocyte, and chondrocyte lineages following directed differentiation. It was found that PDT of zebrafish heart and liver tissue-derived MSCs were 50.67 and 46.61 h, respectively. These cells had significantly more rapid growth on day 4. Our results show that zebrafish heart and liver tissue-derived MSCs exhibited typical MSC characteristics including fibroblast morphology, multi-lineage differentiation capacity, pluripotency potential and expression of a typical set of classic MSC surface markers.","Ultrastructural organisation of the spermatozoon of Allopodocotyle tunisiensis Derbel and Neifar, 2009 (Digenea, Opecoelidae), an intestinal parasite of Solea aegyptiaca Chabanaud, 1927 (Teleostei, Soleidae).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30947958,Tissue & cell,2019 04 05,"The ultrastructure of the spermatozoon of Allopodocotyle tunisiensis (Digenea, Opecoelidae), an intestinal parasite of Solea aegyptiaca (Teleostei, Soleidae), is described by transmission electron microscopy (TEM).

In particular, we discuss the off-target immune-modulatory effects of approved cardiovascular therapies, review the attempted anti-inflammatory therapies including the recently published CIRT (Cardiovascular Inflammation Reduction Trial), and discuss the likely reasons for their failures. We further build on CANTOS to review the immune-modulatory therapies for atherosclerosis currently in trials, and discuss the likelihood of their added value as well as the potential hazard associated with their use.

To prevent the introduction bias in health care AI, the physician community should work with developers and regulators to develop pathways to ensure that algorithms marketed for widespread clinical practice are safe, effective, and free of unintended bias. The ACR Data Science Institute has developed structured AI use cases with data elements that allow the development of standardized data sets for AI testing and training across multiple institutions to promote the availability of diverse data for algorithm development. Additionally, the ACR Data Science Institute validation and monitoring services, ACR Certify-AI and ACR Assess-AI, incorporate standards to mitigate algorithm bias and promote health equity. In addition to promoting diversity, the ACR should promote and advocate for payment models for AI that afford access to AI tools for all of our patients regardless of socioeconomic status or the inherent resources of their health systems.","Radiology Support, Communication, and Alignment Network and Its Role to Promote Health Equity in the Delivery of Radiology Care.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30947900,Journal of the American College of Radiology : JACR,2019 05 10,"Racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic disparities in radiological care have been well documented in both the emergency and outpatient setting. Health IT has the potential to facilitate equitable care across diverse populations. Ordering the appropriate study is the first step in the greater mission of improving access and equity for everyone. Radiology Support, Communication, and Alignment Network (R-SCAN) is an informatics-based solution using clinical decision support (CDS) to promote health equity through optimization in appropriate imaging utilization. R-SCAN and CDS may help combat the potential implicit bias of clinicians by providing evidence-based imaging guidelines at the point of care and ensure that patients will receive equitable and appropriate imaging regardless of ethnic and socioeconomic background.

Challenges to screening include access to care, awareness of the option for screening, stigma and implicit bias that are due to stigmatization of smoking, stigma of race, nihilism with lung cancer diagnosis viewed as a ""death sentence,"" shared decision making, and underestimation of lung cancer risk. African Americans (AA) have the highest lung cancer mortality rate in the United States despite similar smoking rates as whites. AAs are diagnosed at a later stage, and there is a greater likelihood they will refuse treatment options when diagnosed. Additionally, fewer AAs were found to meet lung cancer screening eligibility criteria compared with whites because of lower tobacco exposure and younger age at time of diagnosis. Outreach and access for lung cancer screening in the AA community and other subpopulations at risk are critical to avoid further increasing disparities in lung cancer morbidity and mortality as lung cancer screening is implemented across the United States. The path forward requires implementing outreach programs and providing lung cancer screening in underserved communities at high risk for lung cancer; consideration of using National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines for screening selection criteria, including risk model screening selection; and developing interventions to address stigma, clinician implicit bias, and nihilism.",Improving Lung Cancer Screening Access for Individuals With Serious Mental Illness.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30947893,Journal of the American College of Radiology : JACR,2019 06 10,"Lung cancer continues to be the leading cause of cancer mortality in the United States across all races and ethnicities, but it does not affect everyone equally. Individuals with serious mental illness (SMI), including schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, experience two to four times greater lung cancer mortality in part due to high rates of smoking, delays in cancer diagnosis, and inequities in cancer treatment. Additionally, adults with SMI experience patient, clinician, and health care system-level barriers to accessing cancer screening, such as cognitive deficits that impact understanding of cancer risk, higher rates of poverty and social isolation, patient-provider communication challenges, decreased access to tobacco cessation, and the fragmentation of primary care and mental health care. Despite the proven benefits and mandated coverage by public and private payers, lung cancer screening participation rates remain low among eligible patients, below 4% a year. Given disparities in other cancer screening modalities, these rates are likely to be even lower among individuals with SMI. This article provides a brief overview of current challenges in lung cancer screening and describes a pilot collaboration between radiology and psychiatry that has potential to improve access to lung cancer screening for individuals with serious mental illness.",Challenges and Opportunities for Lung Cancer Screening in Rural America.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30947892,Journal of the American College of Radiology : JACR,2019 05 10,"Rural populations have higher rates of smoking and both lung cancer incidence and mortality compared with their urban peers. As such, it is imperative that high-risk, rural populations have access to recommended low-dose CT (LDCT) screening, which can detect lung cancer at an earlier, more treatable stage. Data from the 2015 National Health Interview Survey, a nationally representative survey, were analyzed to assess nonmetropolitan-metropolitan and geographic differences in LDCT utilization among screening-eligible individuals. Screening uptake did not differ by nonmetropolitan vs. metropolitan status (3.72% and 3.83%, respectively). Regional uptake varied from 1.58% in the West to 10.11% in the Northeast. Additionally, nonmetropolitan populations represent a disproportionately high 23% of the screening-eligible population despite accounting for only 15% of the US population. There are two key challenges to high-quality LDCT screening experienced by rural populations: (1) geographic access to LDCT screening programs and (2) provider-patient communication. Despite the increased availability of LDCT screening centers since 2015, which is when most insurance plans began to cover the costs of screening, centers are geographically maldistributed relative to the rural-urban and regional need. Although decision aids can facilitate discussion between providers and patients regarding the risks and benefits of LDCT screening, research on the uptake and utility of these tools in rural areas is very limited. Analyses of population-based surveys and administrative and clinical data are needed to continue to surveil screening utilization, elucidate predictors of screening use, and inform shared decision-making tools and interventions for at-risk rural populations.","Relationships Between Health Care Disparities and Coverage Policies for Breast, Colon, and Lung Cancer Screening.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30947890,Journal of the American College of Radiology : JACR,2019 05 10,"Disparities in outcomes exist for breast, colon, and lung cancer among diverse populations, particularly racial and ethnic underrepresented minorities (URMs) and individuals from lower socioeconomic status. For example, blacks experience mortality rates up to about 42% higher than whites for these cancers. Furthermore, although overall death rates have been declining, the differential access to screening and care has aggravated disparities. Our purpose is to assess how the coverage policies of CMS and the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) influence these disparities. Additionally, barriers are often encountered in accessing screening tests and receiving prompt treatment. To narrow, and potentially eliminate, outcomes disparities, CMS and USPSTF could consider revising their decision-making processes regarding coverage. Some options include (1) extending their evidence base to include observational studies that involve groups at higher risk; (2) lowering the threshold ages for screening to encompass differences in incidence; (3) CMS approving screening CT colonography coverage, which can even increase compliance with other screening tests; (4) clarifying and streamlining guidelines; (5) supporting research on improving access to screening; and (6) encouraging the development of more navigation services for URMs.",Beyond Universal Health Care: Barriers to Breast Cancer Screening Participation in Canada.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30947889,Journal of the American College of Radiology : JACR,2019 05 10,"Despite well-established preventive screening guidelines for breast cancer, screening rates do not meet targets in both the United States and Canada.

Using the 2012 National Trauma Data Bank, we identified 5858 patients with major abdominal and/or pelvic vascular injury. Patients were stratified by age group, gender, race, Injury Severity Score (ISS), and mechanism of injury. We evaluated the percentage of patients with blunt and penetrating trauma by demographic and correlated the mechanism of injury to the ISS score, emergency room disposition, and hospital disposition. We performed a logistic regression analysis to calculate predictors of death. In the final cohort, 1458 patients (25%) with abdominal/pelvic vascular injury died of trauma. In total, 3368 patients (57%) had a blunt mechanism of injury, whereas 2353 (40%) were victims of a penetrating trauma. Patients with penetrating injuries were 1.72 times more likely to die from their injuries than those with blunt traumas. Patients with higher ISS scores (>16) were more likely to die from their injuries than patients with lower ISS scores. Men were more likely to experience a penetrating vascular injury than women (48% vs 17%). Similarly, 77 per cent of black patients had a penetrating mechanism of injury compared with 20 per cent of white patients. There were 1910 patients with penetrating injuries (81%) that went immediately from the emergency room to the OR, compared with 1287 patients with blunt injuries (38%).

We developed a chest trauma protocol for our ""elderly"" (>45 years) trauma patients and sought to determine whether this would improve pulmonary outcomes. We retrospectively reviewed our elderly chest trauma patients one year before (CTRL) and nine months after implementation (STU) of the chest trauma protocol. The protocol consisted of intravenous narcotics, oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, prophylactic noninvasive ventilation, and measurements of incentive spirometry. In the control year, there were 176 patients meeting study criteria, whereas 140 met the criteria in the STU group. The CTRL group had 11 unplanned ICU admissions (rate 0.063), six unplanned intubations (rate 0.034), and eight patients diagnosed with pneumonia (rate 0.045). These rates decreased in the STU group to two unplanned ICU admissions (0.014, P = 0.044), one unplanned intubation (rate 0.007, P = 0.138), and no patients with pneumonia (0.0, P = 0.010). Our chest trauma protocol has significantly decreased adverse pulmonary events in our older blunt chest trauma population with multiple rib fractures. This protocol has become our standard procedure for patients older than 45 years admitted with rib fractures.",Open Diverticulectomy and Cricopharyngotomy for Symptomatic Zenker's Diverticulum after Endoscopic Diverticuloesophagostomy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30947775,The American surgeon,2019 04 15,"Two of the accepted treatments for symptomatic Zenker's diverticula are open resection of the diverticulum with cricopharyngotomy and transoral, endoscopic diverticuloesophagostomy with cricopharyngotomy. We report our experience with open surgical resection of the diverticulum with repeat cricopharyngotomy in patients with persistent symptoms after endoscopic diverticuloesophagostomy. This is a retrospective review of patients who underwent open surgical resection of the diverticulum, with repeat cricopharyngotomy in patients with persistent symptoms after endoscopic diverticuloesophagostomy. Medical records were reviewed for demographics, surgical detail, short-term complications, and symptomatic outcomes. Four patients underwent open resection of a Zenker's diverticulum with repeat cricopharyngotomy. There were two men and two women, with a mean age of 77.5 years. The mean operative time was 56 minutes and median length of stay was two days. All patients had improvement in dysphagia. Surgical diverticulectomy with cricopharyngotomy after failed endoscopic diverticuloesophagostomy is a technically challenging operation. However, symptomatic improvement can be achieved.",Lumbar Incisional Hernia Repair: Complete Reconstruction of the Deficient Myofascial Component Using Christmas Tree Bone Anchors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30947774,The American surgeon,2019 04 15,"Lumbar incisional hernias are difficult to repair because one of the hernia margins is bone, namely, the iliac crest. Previous studies have described the use of orthopedic bone anchors that fix a mesh onto the iliac crest. We present a novel technique for open repair of large lumbar incisional hernias using a double-mesh technique in combination with suture-loaded bone anchors to reattach the abdominal wall musculature onto the iliac crest. The surgical technique involves creating a preperitoneal plane behind the transversus abdominus and above the iliac crest and iliacus, below the iliac crest, with application of a Prolene mesh in this layer. This is followed by the drilling of suture-loaded Christmas Tree bone anchors™ along the rim of the iliac crest. The preloaded sutures are used to attach the myofascial component on the iliac crest, followed by the placement of a second Prolene mesh in an on-lay fashion. Drains are left in the preperitoneal and subcutaneous spaces. Unlike other reported techniques in the literature which only fix mesh onto the iliac crest, our technique with the use of Christmas Tree bone anchors™ allows for complete reconstruction of the lumbar abdominal wall defect and its myofascial components.",Laparoscopic Weight Loss Surgery in the Elderly: An ACS NSQIP Study on the Effect of Age on Outcomes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30947773,The American surgeon,2019 04 15,"In an era of rising obesity and an aging population, there are conflicting data regarding outcomes of laparoscopic weight loss surgery in older Americans. The aim of this study was to characterize the short-term outcomes of laparoscopic weight loss surgery in the elderly. The ACS NSQIP database was queried for obese patients aged ≥40 years undergoing laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass or sleeve gastrectomy. Patients were subdivided into age groups: 40 to 49, 50 to 59, 60 to 64, 65 to 69, and ≥70 years, and compared with univariate and multivariate analyses. Fifty-three thousand five hundred thirty-three patients were identified. Roux-en-Y gastric bypass was performed in 57.5 per cent of cases and was more common than sleeve gastrectomy in all age groups (P < 0.05). Comorbidities increased significantly with increasing age. There was an increase in minor (4.6% vs 9.1%; P < 0.0001) and major complications (2.2% vs 6.3%; P < 0.0001), and 30-day mortality (0.1% vs 0.5%; P = 0.0001) between the 40 to 49 and ≥70 years age groups. Increased age was independently associated with major complications. Mortality also increased with age. Older patients undergoing laparoscopic weight loss surgery have increased morbidity and mortality. When controlling for comorbidities, increases in age continued to impact major and minor complications and mortality.",Penetrating Renal Trauma: Nonoperative Management Is Safe in Selected Patients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30947772,The American surgeon,2019 04 15,"Present literature seems to support the nonoperative management of penetrating renal trauma although data remain limited. We conducted a nine-year retrospective review of nonoperative versus operative management and mechanism of injury [stab wound (SW) versus gunshot wound (GSW)] among patients admitted with penetrating renal trauma. Of 203 patients, the median age was 24 years, with the majority being male and having GSW injuries. More than half (52.2%) were treated nonoperatively (69.9% of SW and 40% of GSW injured patients). When compared with all operative patients combined, nonoperative patients had a lower median Injury Severity Score (17 vs 26, P < 0.001), lower transfusion requirement (27.4% vs 77.3%, P < 0.001), shorter median hospital stay (4.7 vs 12.6 days, P < 0.001), and lower mortality (1.9% vs 13.4%, P = 0.002). Gunshot wound patients had a higher median Injury Severity Score (26 vs 14, P < 0.001), higher median American Association for the Surgery of Trauma-Organ Injury Score (3 vs 2, P = 0.001), greater need for transfusion (69.2% vs 29.3%, P < 0.001), longer median hospital length of stay (12.1 vs 3.9 days, P < 0.001), and greater mortality (12.5% vs 0%, P < 0.001) than SW patients. Nonoperative management of penetrating renal injury is safe in selected patients. In addition, renal GSW injuries are associated with a greater morbidity and mortality.",Overuse of Previsit Ultrasound in Patients Referred for Treatment of Inguinal Hernias.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30947771,The American surgeon,2019 04 15,"Inguinal ultrasound (US) has a high sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of inguinal hernias but is often performed unnecessarily, adding cost and time to treatment. The aim of our study was to assess the rate and necessity of US before clinical examination by a hernia surgeon. Medical records of patients referred for an inguinal hernia from April through July 2017 were reviewed. These cases were analyzed for patient demographics, physical examination (PE) findings, previsit imaging, health-care system of surgeon, and case outcome. Twenty-nine per cent of patients had an inguinal US before visiting a surgeon. Sixty-three per cent of patients who underwent an US had a palpable hernia on PE, and 76 per cent had a positive PE by the surgeon. Patients without a hernia on referring provider's PE underwent US 59 per cent of the time. Inguinal USs are being ordered unnecessarily by referring providers. Physical examination by referring providers and surgeons should be the primary tool for diagnosis of an inguinal hernia.",Diagnosis-Related Group in Colon Surgery: Identifying Areas of Improvement to Drive High-Value Care.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30947770,The American surgeon,2019 04 15,"Diagnosis-related group (DRG) migration is defined as the reassignment of colectomy patients from DRG 331 to 330 based exclusively on postoperative complications. Strategic and comparative application of this metric has the potential to demonstrate baseline and excessive rates of complications related directly to patient care differences across institutions. The aim of this study was to report the variability of DRG migration across United States hospitals and its impact on overall cost and length of stay (LOS). This study investigated the variability of DRG migration rates across United States hospitals polling 5 per cent of the national Medicare data. The study endpoints were total cost, LOS, and DRG migration rate. Hospitals were classified into tertiles for low (0.1-16.6%), moderate (16.7-23.0%), and high (23.1-83.3%) DRG migration rates. The study included 5120 patients from 615 hospitals. DRG migration rates for hospitals ranged from 0.1 per cent to 83.3 per cent, with 157 in the low, 183 in the moderate, and 364 in the high tertile. DRG migration resulted in a progressively increased LOS and hospital costs from the lowest to highest tertile. Several diagnoses were identified which are suggestive of failure to integrate evidence-based processes of care across the tertiles. The data confirm a wide variation in DRG migration rates from DRG 331 to 330 based only on postoperative complications. These ranges allow for the potential definition of both best practice, and opportunities for quality improvement with respect to postoperative complications, identification of hospital outliers, and the economics of care as part of a value-based care program.",Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy Outcomes in Patients with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30947769,The American surgeon,2019 04 15,"Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common disease among the bariatric population. However, there are limited data regarding the impact of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (SG) on these patients. The study was conducted at University Hospital, United States. The purpose of this study was to examine per cent excess body weight loss (%EWL) and diabetes control in patients who have PCOS compared with those without PCOS. A total of 550 female patients underwent SG between December 2011 and October 2016. Retrospective analysis was completed to include follow-up data at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months and yearly after that. Outcomes measured were %EWL and hemoglobin A1c (HgbA1c). The mean and median follow-up for the entire cohort was 21 and 15 months, respectively. Seventy-eight per cent of patients completed at least 12 months of follow-up for %EWL, although only 21 per cent had similar follow-up for HgbA1c. PCOS patients had similar age (36.3 vs 36.2 years, P = 0.90), preoperative BMI (47.2 vs 47.2, P = 0.99), preoperative HgbA1c (6% vs 5.8%, P = 0.31), conversion rate to gastric bypass, and other associated comorbidities compared with non-PCOS comparisons. There was no difference in %EWL at 12-month (49.7% vs 53.1%, P = 0.53) or 24-month (43% vs 49.8%, P = 0.46) postoperative intervals. There was no difference in absolute change of HgbA1c at 12 months (-0.47% vs -0.67%, P = 0.39). SG has equivalent short-term results in %EWL and reduction in HgbA1c for patients who have PCOS and those who do not."

Concerns have been raised that this practice can result in reduced growth. This retrospective clinical audit collected data from the medical records of a cohort of preterm infants (≤30 weeks gestational age) receiving either ≥28 d of PDHM (n 53) or ≥28 d of their mother's own milk (MOM, n 43) with standard fortification supplied to both groups during admission. Weight growth velocity was assessed from regained birth weight to 34+1 weeks' postmenstrual age (PMA); and weight, length and head circumference were compared at discharge and 12 months (corrected age). At 34+1 weeks' PMA, the weight growth velocity (g/kg per d) was significantly lower in the PDHM group (15·4 g/kg per d, 95 % CI 14·6, 16·1) compared with the MOM group (16·9 g/kg per d, 95 % CI 16·1, 17·7, P=0·007). However, the increase was still within clinically acceptable limits (&gt;15 g/kg per d) and no significant difference was observed in the weight between the two groups. There was no significant difference in weight between the groups at discharge or at the 12-month corrected gestational age review. Although we demonstrated a significant reduction in the weight growth velocity of preterm infants receiving PDHM at 34 weeks' PMA, this difference is not present at discharge, suggesting that the growth deficit is reduced by supplementation before discharge.",Clinical and biological effects of long-term lithium treatment in older adults with amnestic mild cognitive impairment: randomised clinical trial.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30947755,The British journal of psychiatry : the journal of mental science,2019 04 05,"Experimental studies indicate that lithium may facilitate neurotrophic/protective responses in the brain.

It is generally accepted that this period saw the rise of professional practitioners and the emergence of biology (as opposed to the older mode of natural history). However, recent scholarship has increasingly shown that this narrative elides the more complex processes at work in shaping scientific communities from the 1850s to the turn of the century. This article adds to such scholarship by examining the ways in which the editors of four entomological periodicals from across this time frame attempted to shape the communities of their readership, and in particular focuses upon the apparent divide between 'mere collectors' and 'entomologists' as expressed within these journals. Crucially, the article argues that non-professional practitioners were active in defining their own distinct identities and thereby claiming scientific authority. Alongside the periodicals, the article makes use of the correspondence archive of the entomologist and periodical editor Henry Tibbats Stainton (1822-1892), which has hitherto not been subject to sustained analysis by historians.",Sequential organ failure assessment score is an excellent operationalization of disease severity of adult patients with hospitalized community acquired pneumonia - results from the prospective observational PROGRESS study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30947753,"Critical care (London, England)",2019 06 12,"CAP (Community acquired pneumonia) is frequent, with a high mortality rate and a high burden on health care systems.

CXL requires delivery of 5.4 J/cm2 of ultraviolet A (UVA) radiation to a cornea saturated with riboflavin in order to induce cross-link formation. The conventional CXL procedure achieves this fluence by exposing the cornea to a 3 mW/cm2 UVA lamp for 30 min; however, some surgeons have proposed accelerated protocols which achieve the same fluence in a shorter period of time by using a higher power light source. Whether accelerated protocols are as effective in arresting ectasia as the established conventional procedure remains unclear.

However, safety concerns regarding the potential increase in oxidative stress and other adverse effects persist and it remains unclear whether all iron preparations are equivalent. Indeed, the comparative risk of adverse events with IV iron preparations has not been extensively assessed. We hypothesize that IV iron leads to changes in oxidative stress, endothelial function, and potential renal damage depending on the iron formulation (related to the generation of ""free"" or catalytic labile iron) and this may result in more tubular and glomerular injury manifested as increased proteinuria and raised neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) levels in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD).",Addressing preconception behaviour change through mobile phone apps: a protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30947750,Systematic reviews,2019 04 17,"Many of the adverse outcomes experienced by mothers and babies are directly related to the health of the woman prior to pregnancy.

Mobile phone applications as a behaviour change intervention have the potential to address these risks through supporting the provision of information, healthier lifestyles and informed decision-making. The aim of this systematic review is to assess the effectiveness of mobile phone applications in promoting behaviour change and improving long-term outcomes for mother and babies, in women of reproductive age.",Predictors of poor glycemic control among patients with type 2 diabetes on follow-up care at a tertiary healthcare setting in Ethiopia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30947749,BMC research notes,2019 04 17,Contemporary clinical guidelines endorsed that glycemic control is the ultimate goal in the management patients with diabetes.

However, the precise effects and mechanisms of excess androgen during follicular development are still unclear. Here we investigated the effects of androgen on mouse follicle development in vitro. Androgen did not affect the growth of follicles smaller than 160-180 μm in the presence of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). However, in the presence of low FSH, androgen supported the growth of follicles larger than 160-180 μm, a size at which growing follicles acquire FSH-dependency. Androgen did not change the mRNA expression of various growth-promoting factors but did increase mRNA expression of the FSH receptor.

On the basis of discussion in this review, we hope more effective, selective and drug-like CDK8 inhibitors will be developed and demonstrate therapeutic values in the near future.",Autoimmune Hepatitis and Stellate Cells; an Insight into the Role of Autophagy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30947648,Current medicinal chemistry,2019 04 05,"Autoimmune hepatitis is a necroinflammatory process of liver, featuring interface hepatitis by T cells, macrophages and plasma cells that invade to periportal parenchyma. In this process a variety of cytokines is secreted and liver tissue undergoes fibrogenesis, that cause apoptosis of hepatocytes. Autophagy is a complementary mechanism for restraining intracellular pathogens to which the innate immune system does not provide an efficient endocytosis. Hepatocytes with their particular regenerative features are normally in a quiescent state, and, autophagy controls the accumulation of excess products, therefore the liver serves as a basic model for the study of autophagy. Impairment of autophagy in liver causes the accumulation of damaged organelles, misfolded proteins and exceeded lipids in hepatocytes as seen in metabolic diseases. In this review, we introduce autoimmune hepatitis in association with autophagy signaling. We also discuss some genes and proteins of autophagy, their regulatory roles in activation of hepatic stellate cells and the importance of lipophagy and tyrosine kinase in hepatic fibrogenesis. In order to provide a comprehensive overview on the regulatory role of autophagy in autoimmune hepatitis, a pathway analysis of autophagy in autoimmune hepatitis is also included in this article.",Impact of previous stroke on outcome after thrombectomy in patients with large vessel occlusion.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30947643,International journal of stroke : official journal of the International Stroke Society,2019 04 05,Many patients with large vessel occlusion (LVO) who are otherwise candidates for endovascular treatment (EVT) have had previous strokes.

Despite the existence of neuroimaging modalities that depict the onset of the accompanying cerebral vasospasm, preventive and therapeutic options are limited and fail to improve outcome owing to an insufficient pathomechanistic understanding of the delayed perfusion deficit. Previous studies have suggested that BOXes (bilirubin oxidation end products), originating from released heme surrounding ruptured blood vessels, are involved in arterial vasoconstriction. Recently, isolated intermediates of oxidative bilirubin degradation, known as PDPs (propentdyopents), have been considered as potential additional effectors in the development of arterial vasoconstriction.","Difficult TEE Probe Placement: The Evidence, Troubleshooting Techniques, and a Guide to Alternative Monitoring Options for Intraoperative Physicians.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30947628,Seminars in cardiothoracic and vascular anesthesia,2019 04 05,"Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) imaging has become an essential component of many open and interventional cardiac procedures and has increasing use in monitoring for noncardiac procedures, partly because of an aging population. Whether expected or not, encountering difficulty when inserting the TEE probe presents the anesthesiologist with a conundrum. Repeated insertion attempts increase the risk of a serious complication; however, proceeding without TEE may be unacceptable to the proceduralist or surgeon.

We divide the total population into four different compartments, namely, the susceptible individuals in which the disease transmission rate is distributed by white noise, the acutely infected individuals in which the same perturbation occur, the chronically infected individuals and the recovered individuals. We use the stochastic Lyapunov function theory to construct a suitable stochastic Lyapunov function for the existence of positive solution. We also then establish the sufficient conditions for the hepatitis B extinction and the hepatitis B persistence. At the end numerical simulation is carried out by using the stochastic Runge-Kutta method to support our analytical findings.","The influence of relatedness proportion on the joint relationship among word frequency, stimulus quality, and semantic priming in the lexical decision task.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30947626,Quarterly journal of experimental psychology (2006),2019 04 29,"In the lexical decision task, the additive effects of stimulus quality and word frequency have been used to infer the presence of independent processing stages in visual word recognition. Importantly, this pattern can be moderated by semantic priming, suggesting the presence of a retrospective prime retrieval mechanism that is selectively engaged based on task context (i.e., utility of the primes). We examine the sensitivity of this mechanism in two lexical decision experiments that manipulate stimulus quality, word frequency, and semantic priming. Critically, we studied these joint effects when the proportion of related primes was set at .50 or .25. Results indicated that with a .50 relatedness proportion, a three-way interaction was obtained such that additivity between frequency and stimulus quality was found following related semantic primes, but an overadditive pattern was exhibited following unrelated primes. When the relatedness proportion was reduced to .25, this interaction was eliminated. Furthermore, relatedness proportion affected the magnitude of the stimulus quality by priming interaction but not the frequency by priming interaction. These results are interpreted within the context of a flexible lexical processer that adaptively engages processes in response to task context.",Beta-thalassemia: renal complications and mechanisms: a narrative review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30947625,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",2019 04 18,"Beta-thalassemias are a group of recessively autosomal inherited disorders of hemoglobin synthesis, which, due to mutations of the beta-globin gene, lead to various degrees of defective beta-chain production, an imbalance in alpha/beta-globin chain synthesis, ineffective erythropoiesis, and anemia.

Most studies have dealt with non-criminal populations. This study aimed to explore the relationship between self-esteem and aggression and investigate possible differences in self-esteem and aggression between female inmates and women without criminal records (non-criminals) in the prefecture of Attica, Greece. One hundred fifty-seven female inmates in the Attica's Korydallos Female Prison and 150 non-criminals from Attica's general population completed the Buss & Perry Aggression Questionnaire and Rosenberg's Self-esteem Scale between February 2012 and April 2014. Lower self-esteem was associated with higher aggression among women independent of criminality. Self-esteem was lower in inmates (Mean = 18.06, SD = 6.19) than in non-criminals (Mean = 21.65, SD = 4.90, p < .001). Female prisoners presented higher aggression than non-criminals (unadjusted Mean = 78.40, SD = 23.60 versus Mean = 68.82, SD = 14.95, p < .001). However, after adjusting for age, education and self-esteem, this difference was no longer statistically significant (p = .127).

Anxiety sensitivity (AS), the fear of physiological arousal and bodily sensations, is a risk factor for anxiety and poor sleep. Smoking also contributes to poor sleep and may compound the effects of AS on sleep quality. This study evaluated the main and interactive effects of AS and cigarettes/day on sleep quality among smokers. Participants (n = 190) were adult treatment-seeking daily smokers who completed a baseline assessment as part of a larger smoking cessation trial. Sleep quality was self-reported. Results indicated that AS was significantly correlated with greater disturbance in sleep duration, subjective sleep quality, sleep onset latency, sleep disturbance, daytime dysfunction, and sleep medication use. There was a significant interaction between AS and cigarettes/day in terms of sleep onset latency, but not other sleep quality indices. AS was associated with significantly longer sleep onset latency minutes among heavier smokers, but not lighter smokers. Specifically, the association between AS and sleep onset latency was significant for those who smoked ≥ 33 cigarettes/day. AS is a psychological factor that may contribute to poor sleep quality, especially in heavy smokers, and thus may be a promising intervention target."

Our goal was to study cohorts with acquired and developmental prosopagnosia with a complementary battery of tests of object recognition that address prior limitations, as well as evaluating for residual effects of object expertise. We studied 15 subjects with acquired and 12 subjects with developmental prosopagnosia on three tests: the Old/New Tests, the Cambridge Bicycle Memory Test, and the Expertise-adjusted Test of Car Recognition. Most subjects with developmental prosopagnosia were normal on the Old/New Tests: for acquired prosopagnosia, subjects with occipitotemporal lesions often showed impairments while those with anterior temporal lesions did not. Ten subjects showed a putative classical dissociation between the Cambridge Face and Bicycle Memory Tests, seven of whom had normal reaction times. Both developmental and acquired groups showed reduced car recognition on the expertise-adjusted test, though residual effects of expertise were still evident. Two subjects with developmental prosopagnosia met criteria for normal object recognition across all tests. We conclude that strong evidence for intact object recognition can be found in a few subjects but the majority show deficits, particularly those with the acquired form. Both acquired and developmental forms show residual but reduced object expertise effects.",Medicaid Patients Have Greater Difficulty Scheduling Health Care Appointments Compared With Private Insurance Patients: A Meta-Analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30947608,"Inquiry : a journal of medical care organization, provision and financing",2019 05 05,"Medicaid patients are known to have reduced access to care compared with privately insured patients; however, quantifying this disparity with large controlled studies remains a challenge. This meta-analysis evaluates the disparity in health services accessibility of appointments between Medicaid and privately insured patients through audit studies of health care appointments and schedules. Audit studies evaluating different types of outpatient physician practices were selected. Studies were categorized based on the characteristics of the simulated patient scenario. The relative risk of appointment availability was calculated for all different types of audit scenario characteristics. As a secondary analysis, appointment availability was compared pre- versus post-Medicaid expansion. Overall, 34 audit studies were identified, which demonstrated that Medicaid insurance is associated with a 1.6-fold lower likelihood in successfully scheduling a primary care appointment and a 3.3-fold lower likelihood in successfully scheduling a specialty appointment when compared with private insurance. In this first meta-analysis comparing appointment availability between Medicaid and privately insured patients, we demonstrate Medicaid patients have greater difficulty obtaining appointments compared with privately insured patients across a variety of medical scenarios.",A randomized comparison of ultrasound-guided versus landmark-based corticosteroid injection for trigger finger.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30947606,"The Journal of hand surgery, European volume",2019 05 07,"One hundred and four patients who had been diagnosed with trigger finger and were to be treated by corticosteroid injection were randomized into two groups; one for landmark-based injection and the other for ultrasound-guided injection.

The aim of this in vitro study was to examine the steroid hormone (progesterone and 17- β estradiol) release, proliferation (PCNA and cyclin B1) and apoptosis (caspase 3 and p53) of porcine ovarian granulosa cells after the addition of quercetin at concentrations 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10 and 100 μmol L-1. Progesterone release was stimulated at the concentration 10 μmol L-1. Quercetin neither had any impact on 17-β estradiol secretion nor on the presence of PCNA. However, a significant enhancement of the occurrence of cyclin B1 was noted except for the lowest concentration 0.01 μmol L-1. Quercetin did not have any influence on the number of granulosa cells containing caspase 3, but at the concentration 10 μmol L-1 it inhibited p53 occurrence. Results confirm the safety of quercetin in porcine ovarian granulosa cell model and further suggest its possible concentration-dependent influence on ovarian functions through pathway that may involve progesterone, cyclin B1 and p53.",Determinants of Hip and Knee Replacement: The Role of Social Support and Family Dynamics.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30947603,"Inquiry : a journal of medical care organization, provision and financing",2019 05 05,"The objective of this study was to examine variations in the determinants of joint replacement (JR) across gender and age, with emphasis on the role of social support and family dynamics. We analyzed data from the US Health and Retirement Study (1998-2010) on individuals aged 45 or older with no prior receipt of JR. We used logistic regression to analyze the probability of receiving knee or hip replacement by gender and age (<65, 65+). We estimated the effect of demographic, health needs, economic, and familial support variables on the rate of JR. We found that being married/partnered with a healthy spouse/partner is positively associated with JR utilization in both age groups (65+ group OR: 1.327 and <65 group OR: 1.476). While this finding holds for men, it is not statistically significant for women. Among women younger than 65, having children younger than 18 lowers the odds (OR: 0.201) and caring for grandchildren increases the odds (1.364) of having a JR. Finally, elderly women who report availability of household assistance from a child have higher odds of receiving a JR as compared with elderly women without a child who could assist (OR: 1.297). No effect of available support from children was observed for those below 65 years old and elderly men. Our results show that intrafamily dynamics and familial support are important determinants of JR; however, their effects vary by gender and age. Establishing appropriate support mechanisms could increase access to cost-effective JR among patients in need of surgery.",Involvement of the Clock Gene period in the Circadian Rhythm of the Silkmoth Bombyx mori.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30947602,Journal of biological rhythms,2019 06 07,"In Lepidoptera, the roles of period ( per) and the negative feedback involving this gene in circadian rhythm are controversial. In the present study, we established a per knockout strain using TALEN in Bombyx mori, and compared eclosion and hatching rhythms between the per-knockout and wild-type strains to examine whether per is actually involved in these rhythms. The generated per knockout allele was considered null, because it encoded an extensively truncated form of PERIOD (198 aa due to a 64-bp deletion in exon 7, in contrast to 1113 aa in the wild-type protein). In this per knockout strain, circadian rhythms in eclosion and hatching were disrupted. Under LD cycles, however, a steep peak existed at 1 h after lights-on in both eclosion and hatching, and was considered to be produced by a masking effect-a direct response to light. In the per-knockout strain, temporal expression changes of per and timeless ( tim) were also lost. The expression levels of tim were continuously high, probably due to the loss of negative feedback by per and tim. In contrast, the expression levels of per were much lower in the per knockout strain than in the wild type at every time point. From these results, we concluded that per is indispensable for circadian rhythms, and we suggest that the negative feedback loop of the circadian rhythm involving per functions for the production of behavioral rhythms in B. mori.",Spiritual Dimensions of Nurse Practitioner Consultations in Family Practice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30947601,Journal of holistic nursing : official journal of the American Holistic Nurses' Association,2019 04 05,To explore the spiritual dimensions of nurse practitioner consultations in primary care through the lens of availability and vulnerability.

Medicaid offices monitor quality of care, and many states encourage or require plans to adopt quality management practices. This research examines quality management in Medicaid managed care from the perspectives of Medicaid officials, managed care plan representatives, and providers through 25 qualitative interviews in one Northeastern state. Plan representatives described quality management efforts as robust and discussed strategies targeting providers and beneficiaries. Medicaid officials indicated motivations for plans to be responsible for quality management. Providers were unaware of plan efforts or reported them to be counterproductive since performance data were thought to be inaccurate or limited, and modest incentive programs presented excessive administrative burden. Providers' general skepticism about managed care plans' quality improvement efforts may hinder their effectiveness, cause frustration, and lead to administrative burden that may harm care quality.","Examination of Barriers to Medication Adherence, Asthma Management, and Control Among Community Pharmacy Patients With Asthma.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30947599,Journal of pharmacy practice,2019 04 05,"To describe the prevalence of common barriers to asthma medication adherence and examine associations between patient-reported asthma controller adherence and asthma control, therapy adherence barriers, and asthma management characteristics.",Variations of the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 gene in coronary artery disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30947598,The Journal of international medical research,2019 04 05,"Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the principal cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide.

The combined treatment led to ERK hyperactivation and induced IL-6 secretion in BJAB cells but not in Namalwa cells. A blockade of ERK signaling with trametinib suppressed the combination treatment-induced ERK activation, reduced IL-6 mRNA expression, and downregulated IL-6R mRNA expression, resulting in an improvement in the antitumor effect. We stepwise treated Namalwa cells with both inhibitors using on-and-off treatment cycles and found that Namalwa cells gained chemoresistance by activating the ERK/IL-6 feedback loop, suggesting that the ERK-dependent IL-6 positive feedback loop can compensate for AKT inactivation and is closely associated with adaptive resistance and relapse.",Short-Term Outcomes of Three-Port Laparoscopic Right Hemicolectomy Versus Five-Port Laparoscopic Right Hemicolectomy: With a Propensity Score Matching Analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30947574,Journal of investigative surgery : the official journal of the Academy of Surgical Research,2019 04 05,"The aim of this study is to compare the short-term and pathological outcomes of TPLRC (Three-port laparoscopic right hemicolectomy) and FPLRC (Five-port laparoscopic right hemicolectomy), using propensity score matching analysis.",Proteotyping pluripotency with mass spectrometry.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30947573,Expert review of proteomics,2019 05 02,"Pluripotency emerges transiently during embryogenesis in two main forms with different developmental potential, termed naïve and primed states. Importantly, these pluripotent states can be recapitulated in vitro under specific culture conditions, representing a unique model to study the regulatory principles of development and cellular plasticity. Areas covered: A complex network of signaling pathways that senses intrinsic and extrinsic cues controls the fine balance between self-renewal and differentiation. Much of our knowledge on this tight regulation originates from epigenetic and transcriptomic approaches. However, the presence of post-transcriptional and post-translational mechanisms demands a direct assessment of the proteome in its multiple facets. Mass spectrometry-based proteomics is now a mature technique and has started to deliver new insights in the stem cell field. Expert opinion: Here, we review our current understanding on the mechanisms that dictate the spectrum of pluripotency levels. We put special emphasis on the emerging proteomic studies that focused on the molecular properties behind the naïve and primed states. In addition, we hypothesize on the impact that future developments in proteomic technologies can have to improve our view of pluripotency.",Role of mean platelet volume in pregnancy to predict gestational diabetes mellitus in the first trimester.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30947572,"The journal of maternal-fetal & neonatal medicine : the official journal of the European Association of Perinatal Medicine, the Federation of Asia and Oceania Perinatal Societies, the International Society of Perinatal Obstetricians",2019 04 05,Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is defined as glucose intolerance detected for the first time in pregnancy or identified during pregnancy.

Recently, the involvement of two different classes of sRNAs namely, miRNAs (microRNAs), and siRNAs (small interfering RNAs) in biotic stress response has been underlined. Notably, during virus infection, these sRNAs deploy antiviral defense by regulating the gene expression of the modulators of host defense pathways. As a counter defense, viruses have evolved strategic pathways involving the production of suppressors that interfere with the host silencing machinery. This molecular arms race between the sophisticated gene regulatory mechanism of host plants fine-tuned by sRNAs and the defense response exhibited by the virus has gained much attention among the researchers. So far, several reports have been published showing the mechanistic insights on sRNA-regulated defense mechanism in response to virus infection in several crop plants. In this context, our review enumerates the molecular mechanisms underlying host immunity against viruses mediated by sRNAs, the counter defense strategies employed by viruses to surpass this immunogenic response and the advances made in our understanding of plant-virus interactions. Altogether, the report would be insightful for the researchers working to decode the sRNA-mediated defense response in crop plants challenged with virus infection.",Using Family Members as Medical Interpreters: An Explanation of Healthcare Practitioners' Normative Practices in Pediatric and Neonatal Departments in Australia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30947559,Health communication,2019 04 05,"Both international tourism and migration of people with low English proficiency (LEP) to Australia are increasing. Thus, health-care practitioners (HPs) increasingly use interpreters to communicate with patients with LEP. Although qualified interpreters are the most suggested and policy-endorsed mechanism for communicating with patients with LEP, family members (FMIs) are also used as interpreters. This study investigated (a) when do health professionals consider it appropriate to use FMIs and (b) what characteristics of family members health professionals believe make them suitable to act as FMIs. As part of a larger project examining the decision-making processes of HPs regarding interpreter use, 69 HPs from neonatal and pediatric departments in one hospital in Queensland Australia were interviewed. Results indicated HPs thought the appropriateness of using FMIs depended on the type of information, such that it was either completely acceptable (e.g., explaining some basic or non-medical information) or completely unacceptable (e.g., confidential information or consent). However, in an emergency, when no other options were available, FMIs were used. The characteristics of suitable FMIs included age, level of English proficiency and medical understanding, and the relationship between patient and FMI. Results were to some extent consistent with Queensland government policies but there were notable differences, including using children and regarding FMIs as first preference. Improving HP's knowledge of policies may increase their confidence in their practice and appropriate use of FMIs, thereby improving their care delivery to patients and families with LEP.","Influence of Hemoglobin Level on Muscle and Physical Functions, Activities of Daily Living, and Quality of Life in Patients With Hematological Malignancies.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30947558,Integrative cancer therapies,2019 05 05,"Patients with hematological malignancies often present with reduced muscle and physical functions, which are caused by the disease or related treatment.

Food ads tend to juxtapose unhealthy food products with overly thin models who promote these foods. This paradoxical presentation of food and body raises important questions about adolescents' perceptions of food ads and the body, as part of the larger realm of nutritional health. The study sheds light on adolescents' nutritional health socialization by exploring the role of food advertising as it intersects with other socialization agents, namely parents and peers. Adolescent's perceptions of and reactions to food ads, and the food products and models in these ads, are examined using the media practice model as the theoretical framework. In-depth interviews were conducted with 82 adolescents in middle- and high-school, taking into consideration their development, heightened vulnerability to messages about the body and appearances, and their lived experiences. The study's findings suggest that adolescents, though skeptical of ads, internalize the mediated thin ideal and expect models in ads to be thin, beautiful, and famous. Parents emerged as positive role models for nutritional health whereas peers are more paradoxical, emphasizing the importance of exercising along with a socially-oriented consumption of junk food. Socialization messages from parents, peers, and the media interact in shaping adolescents' reactions to food ads. Only minimal gender differences were found in adolescents' reactions to food ads and their approach to nutritional health. Mostly, female models are expected to meet more stringent standards of thinness and beauty than male models, especially among female adolescents.",Sustainability drivers of Canada's most health-promoting hospital.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30947555,Healthcare management forum,2019 04 26,"Sustaining large health promotion interventions in hospitals is notoriously difficult, and our understanding of sustainability enablers remains peripheral.

The article reviews the current status on the innovation of the Mexican pharmaceutical industry with a focus on cancer drugs. The authors examined the scientific and nonscientific literature in search of the origin of innovative cancer drugs, as well as the regulatory frames by which these drugs are approved in Mexico. The article presents a narrative analysis of the author's experiences on the barriers that impede pharmaceutical innovation in Mexico. To the best of the authors' knowledge, there was only 1 domestic approval by COFEPRIS, the Mexican health regulatory agency, of an anticancer product developed under a repositioning approach. Among the barriers impeding drug innovation in Mexico are, but not be limited to, insufficient funds for the discovery phase; unaffordable or limited capacity for performing preclinical studies under good laboratory practices (GLP); lengthy clinical trial approval; unfavorable conditions for clinical trials for both academic and domestic pharmaceutical industry-sponsored studies; unclear policies for drug approvals and marketing. The authors state specific proposals for overcoming these barriers to generate a climate for increasing participation of academic and existing domestic pharmaceutical industry as well as to increase venture capital and favor start-up and early-stage companies.

Due to their neuroprotective and neurorestorative properties, their therapeutic potential has been tested in various neurodegenerative diseases. Bioavailability of NTFs in the target tissue remains a major challenge for NTF-based therapies. Various intracerebral delivery approaches, both protein and gene transfer-based, have been tested with varying outcomes. Three growth factors, glial cell-line derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), neurturin (NRTN) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF-BB) have been tested in clinical trials in Parkinson's Disease (PD) during the past 20 years. A new protein can now be added to this list, as cerebral dopamine neurotrophic factor (CDNF) has recently entered clinical trials. Despite their misleading names, CDNF, together with its closest relative mesencephalic astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factor (MANF), form a novel family of unconventional NTF that are both structurally and mechanistically distinct from other growth factors. CDNF and MANF are localized mainly to the lumen of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and their primary function appears to be modulation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway. Prolonged ER stress, via the UPR signaling pathways, contributes to the pathogenesis in a number of chronic degenerative diseases, and is an important target for therapeutic modulation. Intraputamenally administered recombinant human CDNF has shown robust neurorestorative effects in a number of small and large animal models of PD, and had a good safety profile in preclinical toxicology studies. Intermittent monthly bilateral intraputamenal infusions of CDNF are currently being tested in a randomized placebo-controlled phase I-II clinical study in moderately advanced PD patients. Here, we review the history of growth factor-based clinical trials in PD, and discuss how CDNF differs from the previously tested growth factors.",Silencing of the Mutant Huntingtin Gene through CRISPR-Cas9 Improves the Mitochondrial Biomarkers in an In Vitro Model of Huntington's Disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30947515,Cell transplantation,2019 04 05,"During the 25-year history of the American Society for Neural Therapy and Repair (ASNTR) there have been several breakthroughs in the area of neurotherapeutics, which was the case during the 2014-2105 year when one of us (GLD) had the privilege of serving as its president.

Constructs within the Research Domain Criteria framework are intentionally transdiagnostic, with the construct of ""acute threat,"" for example, broadly relevant to clinical problems and associated traits involving fearfulness and stress reactivity. A potentially valuable referent for research on the construct of acute threat is a structural model of fear/fearlessness questionnaires known to predict variations in physiological threat reactivity as indexed by startle potentiation. The aim of the current work was to develop an efficient, item-based scale measure of the general factor of this structural model for use in studies of dispositional threat sensitivity and its relationship to psychopathology. A self-report scale consisting of 44 items from a conceptually relevant, nonproprietary questionnaire was first developed in a sample of 1,307 student participants, using the general factor of the fear/fearlessness model as a direct referent. This new Trait Fear scale was then evaluated for convergent and discriminant validity with measures of personality and psychopathology in a separate sample ( n = 213) consisting of community adults and undergraduate students. The strong performance of the scale in this criterion-validation sample suggests that it can provide an effective means for indexing variations along a dispositional continuum of fearfulness reflecting variations in sensitivity to acute threat.","Home Palliative Sedation Using Phenobarbital Suppositories: Time to Death, Patient Characteristics, and Administration Protocol.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30947512,The American journal of hospice & palliative care,2019 04 05,"Most people in the United States and other countries cite their preferred location of death as their homes.

For this, we have introduced the basic reproduction number R₀ of model and we prove that this threshold shows completely the stability of each steady state. Our approach is the use of general constructed Lyapunov functional with some results on the persistence theory.

A PSS can be configured quickly and cheaply to meet the customer's personalized product and service requirements via a PPS design platform, and a modular master structure is the core of PSS design platform. When a PSS instance is configured, it needs to determine the module types and make decisions on the types of PSS firstly, so as to build a master structure for PSS. Therefore, the decision-making on module types and customization degree is a key step to establish the PSS modular master structure. This article proposes a five-step planning method for the modular structure planning of PSS. Firstly, the PSS module types are classified based on the Kano model. Then, bi-level decision-making on modules and its properties are finished by using conjoint analysis method, includes the customer's decision-making on modules and their properties, and the manufacturer's modules and their properties, which provides support for PSS modular optimization configuration design.

In particular, the model is used to assess the impact of different microclimate condition on the population dynamics of malaria. The disease free state of the model is seen to be globally asymptotically stable in the absence of disease induced mortality when the associated reproduction number is less than unity. Also when the associated reproduction number of the model is greater than unity, the disease persist in the population. Numerical simulations of the time-averaged basic reproduction number show that neglecting the variation of indoor and outdoor temperature will under-estimate the value of this threshold parameter. Numerical simulations of the model show that the higher indoor temperature influences the efficacy of control measures as a higher prevalence level is obtained when indoor and outdoor temperature variation is considered. It is further shown that both where the mosquitoes rest and how long they rest there may determine the transmission intensity.",Analysis of spontaneous emergence of cell polarity with delayed negative feedback.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30947426,Mathematical biosciences and engineering : MBE,2019 04 09,"Cell polarity refers to spatial di erences in the shape and structure of cells, which leads to the generation of diverse cell types playing di erent roles in biological processes. Cell polarization usually involves the localization of some specific signaling molecules to a proper location of the cell membrane. Recent studies proposed that delayed negative feedback may be important for maintaining the robustness of cell polarization and the observed oscillating behavior of signaling cluster. However, the fundamental mechanisms for achieving cell polarization under negative feedback remain controversial. In this paper, we formulate the cell polarization system as a non-local reaction di usion equation with positive and delayed negative feedback loops. Through the Turing stability analysis, we identify the parameter conditions, including the range of the time delay constant, for achieving cell polarization without any inhomogeneous spatial cues. Also, our numerical results support that by controlling the length of the time delay in negative feedback and the magnitude of positive feedback, the oscillating behavior of signaling cluster can be observed in our simulations.","GOF/LOF knowledge inference with tensor decomposition in support of high order link discovery for gene, mutation and disease.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30947425,Mathematical biosciences and engineering : MBE,2019 04 09,"For discovery of new usage of drugs, the function type of their target genes plays an important role, and the hypothesis of ""Antagonist-GOF"" and ""Agonist-LOF"" has laid a solid foundation for supporting drug repurposing.

Unlike the design of(entity, predicate, entity) triples in a traditional three way tensor, a four way and a five way tensor, GMFD-/GMAFD-tensor, were designed to represent higher order links among or among part of these entities: genes(G), mutations(M), functions(F), diseases( D) and annotation labels(A). A tensor decomposition algorithm, CP decomposition, was applied to the higher order tensor and to unveil the correlation among entities. Meanwhile, a state-of-the-art baseline tensor decomposition algorithm, RESCAL, was carried on the three way tensor as a comparing method. The result showed that CP decomposition on higher order tensor performed better than RESCAL on traditional three way tensor in recovering masked data and making predictions.

However, since labeled data of privacy objects in remote sensing images are less, the samples for training are commonly small. Besides, traditional deep neural networks have a huge amount of parameters which leads to over complexity of models and have a great heavy of computation. They are not suitable for small sample image classification task. A sparse method for deep neural network is proposed to reduce the complexity of deep learning model with small samples. A singular value decomposition algorithm is employed to reduce the dimensions of the output feature map of the upper convolution layers, which can alleviate the input burden of the current convolution layer, and decrease a large number of parameters of the deep neural networks, and then restrain the number of redundant or similar feature maps generated by the over-complete schemes in deep learning. Experiments with two remote sensing image data sets UCMLU and WHURS show that the image classification accuracy with our sparse model is better than the plain model,which is improving the accuracy by 3%,besides, its convergence speed is faster."

Precipitated by the build up of extra fat in the liver not caused by alcohol, it is still not understood why steatosis occurs where it does in the liver microstructure in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. It is likely, however, that the location of steatosis is due, at least in part, to metabolic zonation (heterogeneity among liver cells in function and enzyme expression). Recently, there has been an influx of computational and mathematical models in order to investigate the relationship between metabolic zonation and steatosis in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Of interest among these models are ""compartments-in-series"" models. Compartments-in-series models include the spatial distribution of metabolite concentrations via series of compartments that are connected through some representation of blood flow. In this paper, we analyze one such model, focusing specifically at how the number of compartments and inclusion of dispersion in the flow affect simulation results. We find the number of compartments to have a much larger effect than the inclusion of dispersion, however this is likely due to numerical artifacts. Overall, we conclude that considering partial differential equations that are equivalent to compartments-in-series models would be beneficial both in computation and in theoretical analyses.",A fast 3-D ultrasound projection imaging method for scoliosis assessment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30947409,Mathematical biosciences and engineering : MBE,2019 04 09,"Applying ultrasound for scoliosis assessment has been an attractive topic over the past decade. This study proposed a new fast 3-D ultrasound projection imaging method to evaluate the spine deformity. A narrow-band rendering method was used to generate the coronal images based on B-mode images and their corresponding positional data. The non-planar reslicing method, which followed the natural spine curve, was used to project the complete spine data into the coronal image. The repeatability of the new method was tested. A comparison experiment on the reconstructed images and the processing time between the conventional 3-D rendering method and the developed projection imaging method was also performed among 70 patients with scoliosis. The intra- and inter-operator tests results demonstrated very good repeatability (ICC ≥ 0.90). The mean processing times for the developed projection method and conventional rendering method were 15.07 ± 0.03 s and 130.31 ± 35.07 s, respectively. The angle measurement results showed a high correlation (y = 0.984x, r = 0.954) between the images obtained using the two methods. The above results indicated that the developed projection imaging method could greatly decrease the processing time while preserving the comparative image quality.

In this regard, the WHO consolidated guidelines on drug-resistant tuberculosis treatment fulfil the mandate of WHO to inform health professionals in Member States on how to improve treatment and care for patients with DR-TB. Between 2011 and 2018, WHO has developed and issued evidence-based policy recommendations on the treatment and care of patients with DR-TB. These policy recommendations have been presented in several WHO documents and their associated annexes, including the WHO treatment guidelines for multidrug- and rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis, 2018 update, issued by WHO in December 2018.

Transcriptional regulation of the genes encoding miRNAs (MIR genes) can be activated by numerous transcription factors, which themselves are regulated by other miRNAs. Fine-tuning of MIR genes or miRNAs is a powerful biotechnological strategy to improve tolerance to abiotic or biotic stresses in crops of economic importance. Current approaches for miRNA fine-tuning are based on the down- or up-regulation of MIR gene transcription and the use of genetic engineering tools to manipulate the final concentration of these miRNAs in the cytoplasm. Transgenesis, cisgenesis, intragenesis, artificial MIR genes, endogenous and artificial target mimicry, MIR genes editing using Meganucleases, ZNF proteins, TALENs and CRISPR/Cas9 or CRISPR/Cpf1, CRISPR/dCas9 or dCpf1, CRISPR13a, topical delivery of miRNAs and epigenetic memory have been successfully explored to MIR gene or miRNA modulation and improve agronomic traits in several model or crop plants.

However, little is known about the population evolution of this species, the genomic difference between its major genetic groups, such as European and Asian rapeseed, and the impacts of historical large-scale introgression events on this young tetraploid. In this study, we reported the de novo assembly of the genome sequences of an Asian rapeseed (B. napus), Ningyou 7, and its four progenitors and compared these genomes with other available genomic data from diverse European and Asian cultivars. Our results showed that Asian rapeseed originally derived from European rapeseed but subsequently significantly diverged, with rapid genome differentiation after hybridization and intensive local selective breeding. The first historical introgression of B. rapa dramatically broadened the allelic pool but decreased the deleterious variations of Asian rapeseed. The second historical introgression of the double-low traits of European rapeseed (canola) has reshaped Asian rapeseed into two groups (double-low and double-high), accompanied by an increase in genetic load in the double-low group. This study demonstrates distinctive genomic footprints and deleterious SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) variants for local adaptation by recent intra- and interspecies introgression events and provides novel insights for understanding the rapid genome evolution of a young allopolyploid crop."

Although immunosuppression (IS) has been implicated as a primary cause, we have previously shown that the implantation response of a kidney allograft can lead to early transcriptional activation of latent murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) genes in an immune-competent host and to MCMV reactivation and dissemination to other organs in a genetically immune-deficient recipient. We now describe a model that allows us to separately analyze the impact of the implantation effect vs that of a clinically relevant IS regimen. Treatment with IS of latently infected mice alone does not induce viral reactivation, but transplant of latently infected allogeneic kidneys combined with IS facilitates MCMV reactivation in the graft and dissemination to other organs. The IS regimen effectively dampens allo-immune inflammatory pathways and depletes recipient anti-MCMV but does not affect ischemia-reperfusion injury pathways. MCMV reactivation similar to that seen in allogeneic transplants combined with also occurs after syngeneic transplants. Thus, our data strongly suggest that while ischemia-reperfusion injury of the implanted graft is sufficient and necessary to initiate transcriptional reactivation of latent MCMV (""first hit""), IS is permissive to the first hit and facilitates dissemination to other organs (""second hit"").",PTPRK suppresses progression and chemo-resistance of colon cancer cells via direct inhibition of pro-oncogenic CD133.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30947381,FEBS open bio,2019 05 07,"Receptor-type protein tyrosine phosphatase κ (PTPRK) is considered to be a candidate tumor suppressor. PTPRK dephosphorylates CD133, which is a stem cell marker; phosphorylated CD133 accelerates xenograft tumor growth of colon cancer cells through the activation of AKT, but the functional significance of this has remained elusive. In this study, we have demonstrated that knockdown of PTPRK potentiates the pro-oncogenic CD133-AKT pathway in colon cancer cells. Intriguingly, depletion of PTPRK significantly reduced sensitivity to the anti-cancer drug oxaliplatin and was accompanied by up-regulation of phosphorylation of Bad, a downstream target of AKT. Together, our present observations strongly suggest that the CD133-PTPRK axis plays a pivotal role in the regulation of colon cancer progression as well as drug resistance.",Two binding proteins of the ABC transporter that confers growth of Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis ATCC27673 on β-mannan possess distinct manno-oligosaccharide-binding profiles.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30947380,Molecular microbiology,2019 04 25,"Human gut bifidobacteria rely on ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters for oligosaccharide uptake. Multiple oligosaccharide-specific solute-binding protein (SBP) genes are occasionally associated with a single ABC transporter, but the significance of this multiplicity remains unclear. Here, we characterize BlMnBP1 and BlMnBP2, the two SBPs associated to the β-manno-oligosaccharide (MnOS) ABC transporter in Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis. Despite similar overall specificity and preference to mannotriose (Kd ≈80 nM), affinity of BlMnBP1 is up to 2570-fold higher for disaccharides than BlMnBP2. Structural analysis revealed a substitution of an asparagine that recognizes the mannosyl at position 2 in BlMnBP1, by a glycine in BlMnBP2, which affects substrate affinity. Both substitution types occur in bifidobacterial SBPs, but BlMnBP1-like variants prevail in human gut isolates. B. animalis subsp. lactis ATCC27673 showed growth on gluco and galactomannans and was able to outcompete a mannan-degrading Bacteroides ovatus strain in co-cultures, attesting the efficiency of this ABC uptake system. By contrast, a strain that lacks this transporter failed to grow on mannan. This study highlights SBP diversification as a possible strategy to modulate oligosaccharide uptake preferences of bifidobacterial ABC-transporters during adaptation to specific ecological niches. Efficient metabolism of galactomannan by distinct bifidobacteria, merits evaluating this plant glycan as a potential prebiotic.","Enantioselective Desymmetrization of 1,4-Dihydropyridines by Oxidative NHC Catalysis.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30947379,"Chemistry (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)",2019 06 05,"The unprecedented desymmetrization of prochiral dialdehydes catalyzed by N-heterocyclic carbenes under oxidative conditions was applied to the highly enantioselective synthesis of 1,4-dihydropyridines (DHPs) starting from 3,5-dicarbaldehyde substrates. Synthetic elaboration of the resulting 5-formyl-1,4-DHP-3-carboxylates allowed for access to the class of pharmaceutically relevant 1,4-DHP-3,5-dicarboxylates (Hantzsch esters).

The nanocomposite was characterized by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms, X-ray diffraction, infrared spectroscopy, and vibrating sample magnetometry. The results showed that the prepared composite had a large surface area (306.45 m²/g), a unique pore size (2.15 nm), and strong magnetic properties (45.7 emμ/g), rendering it a promising sorbent material for magnetic solid-phase extraction. The parameters that affect the extraction efficiency of rhodamine B were optimized with the assistance of response surface methodology. Under the optimal conditions, the developed method has been successfully applied to determine the rhodamine B in food samples. The linearities and limits of detection of rhodamine B in hot pepper, red wine, and chili powder samples were measured. Satisfactory recoveries in the range of 94.8-103.3% with relative standard deviations <5.5% were obtained. Investigation of the adsorption mechanism of magnetic polyimide composite indicated that multiple interactions, including hydrophobic, π-π, and hydrogen bonding interactions, were involved in the adsorption process.",Alternariol as virulence and colonization factor of Alternaria alternata during plant infection.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30947377,Molecular microbiology,2019 04 24,"The filamentous fungus Alternaria alternata is a potent producer of many toxic secondary metabolites, which contaminate food and feed. The most prominent one is the polyketide-derived alternariol (AOH) and its derivative alternariol monomethyl ether (AME). Here, we identified the gene cluster for the biosynthesis of AOH and AME by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene inactivation of several biosynthesis genes in A. alternata and heterologous expression of the gene cluster in Aspergillus oryzae. The 15 kb-spanning gene cluster consists of a polyketide synthase gene, pksI, an O-methyltransferase, omtI, a FAD-dependent monooxygenase, moxI, a short chain dehydrogenase, sdrI, a putative extradiol dioxygenase, doxI and a transcription factor gene, aohR. Heterologous expression of PksI in A. oryzae was sufficient for AOH biosynthesis. Co-expression of PksI with different tailoring enzymes resulted in AME, 4-hydroxy-alternariol monomethyl ether (4-OH-AME), altenusin (ALN) and altenuene (ALT). Hence, the AOH cluster is responsible for the production of at least five different compounds. Deletion of the transcription factor gene aohR led to reduced expression of pksI and delayed AOH production, while overexpression led to increased expression of pksI and production of AOH. The pksI-deletion strain displayed reduced virulence on tomato, citrus and apple suggesting AOH and the derivatives as virulence and colonization factors.",Carotid artery disease in post-stroke survivors and effects of enriched environment on stroke pathology in a mouse model of carotid artery stenosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30947376,Neuropathology and applied neurobiology,2019 05 23,"Carotid artery disease (CAD) is an important risk factor for stroke.

In this study, we explored the potential mechanism of DCZ0801 action, its anti-tumor activity both in vitro and in vivo on MM. This study was carried out via cell cycle proliferation assay, apoptotic analysis, western blot analysis, and examination of xenotransplantation model of tumors. The in vitro studies revealed that DCZ0801 could inhibit cell proliferation and induce apoptosis by regulating both caspase-dependent and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways, inducing S-phase arrest of the cell cycle related to downregulation of CDK2, cyclin-A2, and CDC25A protein expression.

This was achieved by coupling molecular phylogenetic analyses and TEM observations with non-destructive measurements of kleptoplast O2 production over a 15-day experimental study. Results show that the studied E. williamsoni actively selected kleptoplasts mainly from pennate diatoms and had the ability to produce oxygen, up to 13.4 nmol O2 cell-1 d-1, from low to relatively high irradiance over at least 15 days. Ultrastructural features and photophysiological data showed significant differences over time, the number of lipid droplets, residual bodies and the dark respiration increased; whereas, the number of kleptoplasts decreased accompanied by a minor decrease of the photosynthetic rate. These observations suggest that in E. williamsoni kleptoplasts might provide extra carbon storage through lipid droplets synthesis and highlight the complexity of E. williamsoni feeding strategy and the necessity of further dedicated studies regarding mechanisms developed by kleptoplastidic foraminifera for carbon partitioning and storage.",Barriers to hypertension and diabetes management in primary health care in Argentina: qualitative research based on a behavioral economics approach.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30947329,Translational behavioral medicine,2019 04 04,"Despite efforts to improve detection and treatment of adults with hypertension and diabetes in Argentina, many public healthcare system users remain undiagnosed or face barriers in managing these diseases. The purpose of this study is to identify health system, provider, and user-related factors that may hinder detection and treatment of hypertension and diabetes using a traditional and behavioral economics approach. We did qualitative research using in-depth semistructured interviews and focus groups with healthcare providers and adult users of Public Primary Care Clinics. Health system barriers included inadequate care accessibility; poor integration between primary care clinics and local hospitals; lack of resources; and gender bias and neglect of adult chronic disease. Healthcare provider-related barriers were inadequate training; lack of availability or reluctance to adopt Clinical Practice Guidelines; and lack of counseling prioritization. From a behavioral economics perspective, bottlenecks were related to inertia and a status quo, overconfidence, and optimism biases. User-related barriers for treatment adherence included lack of accurate information; resistance to adopt lifelong treatment; affordability; and medical advice mistrust. From a behavioral economics perspective, the most significant bottlenecks were overconfidence and optimism, limited attention, and present biases. Based on these findings, new interventions that aim to improve prevention and control of chronic conditions can be proposed. The study provides empirical evidence regarding the barriers and bottlenecks in managing chronic conditions in primary healthcare settings. Results may contribute to the design of behavioral interventions targeted towards healthcare provision for the affected population.",Long-term urea fertilization alters the composition and increases the abundance of soil ureolytic bacterial communities in an upland soil.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30947327,FEMS microbiology ecology,2019 04 12,"Urea is a widely used nitrogen (N) fertilizer in agriculture, but considerable amounts of urea are lost through ammonia volatilization. Soil microbes are major urease producers; however, the impact of urea application on the soil ureolytic microbial community is poorly understood. In this study, the urease activity and the abundance and composition of the ureolytic bacterial community in soil (30-cm deep) under long-term urea application (four treatments: 0, 200, 400 and 600 kg N ha-1yr-1) were investigated by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and high-throughput sequencing of the ureC gene. Urease activity and ureC abundance decreased with the soil depth and increased with urea fertilization. The ureC/16S rRNA gene ratio slightly varied in the different treatments, and the ureC gene abundance was significantly and positively correlated with urease activity only in surface soil (0-10 cm), despite the greater impact of urea application on the ureolytic bacterial community structure observed in deeper soil layers (10-20 and 20-30 cm). The diversity of the ureolytic bacterial community was higher in upper soil layers than deeper ones and decreased with the urea application rate. These results suggest that long-term intensive urea fertilization may increase the risk of N loss through ammonia volatilization and increase the risk of soil degradation due to the collapse of soil microbial diversity.",An aluminum shield enables the amphipod Hirondellea gigas to inhabit deep-sea environments.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30947320,PloS one,2019 06 10,"The amphipod Hirondellea gigas inhabits the deepest regions of the oceans in extreme high-pressure conditions.

The H. gigas exoskeleton contained aluminum, as well as a major amount of calcium carbonate. Unlike other (accumulated) metals, aluminum was distributed on the surface of the exoskeleton. To investigate how H. gigas obtains aluminum, we conducted a metabolome analysis and found that gluconic acid/gluconolactone was capable of extracting metals from the sediment under the habitat conditions of H. gigas. The extracted aluminum ions are transformed into the gel state of aluminum hydroxide in alkaline seawater, and this gel covers the body to protect the amphipod.

In recent years, considerable evidence has indicated that Gene Ontology (GO) functions, especially GO-biological processes, have important effects on the mechanisms and treatments of different diseases. However, the roles of GO functions in the pathogenesis and treatment of MG have not been well studied. This study aimed to uncover the potential important roles of risk-related GO functions and to screen significant candidate drugs related to GO functions for MG. Based on MG risk genes, 238 risk GO functions and 42 drugs were identified. Through constructing a GO function network, we discovered that positive regulation of NF-kappaB transcription factor activity (GO:0051092) may be one of the most important GO functions in the mechanism of MG. Furthermore, we built a drug-GO function network to help evaluate the latent relationship between drugs and GO functions. According to the drug-GO function network, 5 candidate drugs showing promise for treating MG were identified. Indeed, 2 out of 5 candidate drugs have been investigated to treat MG. Through functional enrichment analysis, we found that the mechanisms between 5 candidate drugs and associated GO functions may involve two vital pathways, specifically hsa05332 (graft-versus-host disease) and hsa04940 (type I diabetes mellitus). More interestingly, most of the processes in these two pathways were consistent. Our study will not only reveal a new perspective on the mechanisms and novel treatment strategies of MG, but also will provide strong support for research on GO functions.",Perceived stress and reference ranges of hair cortisol in healthy adolescents.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30947316,PloS one,2019 04 21,"Chronic stress during adolescence has usually been evaluated through subjective measures, leaving aside objective measures such as hair cortisol concentrations.

In the current study, a validated LC-MS/MS assay was established for DMB quantification in rat liver microsomes (RLMs) with application to the drug metabolic stability assessment. Chromatographic resolution of DMB and lapatinib (internal standard) was achieved using an isocratic mobile phase and a reversed-phase C18 column. The linearity of the established LC-MS/MS assay ranged from 2 to 500 ng/mL with r2 ≥ 0.9999. The limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) were 0.35 and 1.1 ng/mL, respectively. The precision and accuracy (both intra-day and inter-day) were 0.84-3.58% and 92.2-100.32%, respectively. The metabolic stability of DMB in the RLM matrix was estimated by calculating two parameters, in vitro t1/2 (0.97 mL/min/kg) and intrinsic clearance (157.5 min). Such values infer that DMB would be excreted very slowly from the human body, which might lead to possible bioaccumulation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first method for DMB analysis in RLMs with metabolic stability estimation.",The quality of skilled birth attendants in Nepal: High aspirations and ground realities.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30947314,PloS one,2019 04 21,"While Nepal's maternal mortality ratio (MMR) has improved overall, the proportion of maternal deaths occurring in health facilities and attended to by skilled birth attendants (SBAs), has nearly doubled over 12 years.

The best model developed from data already available in the scheduling system, had a good performance to predict patient no-show. It is expected the model to be helpful to overbooking decision in the scheduling system. Further investigation is needed to explore the effectiveness of using this model in terms of improving service performance and its impact on quality of care compared to the usual practice.","Prevalence and predictors of postpartum depression by HIV status and timing of HIV diagnosis in Gauteng, South Africa.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30947293,PloS one,2019 04 21,Postpartum depression (PPD) is a common mental health condition that can compromise the quality of life and functional capacity of mothers and cause health and developmental problems in children born to affected mothers.,Biomechanical evaluation of the influence of posterolateral corner structures on cruciate ligaments forces during simulated gait and squatting.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30947292,PloS one,2019 04 21,"Posterolateral corner (PLC) structures of the knee joint comprise complex anatomical soft tissues that support static and dynamic functional movements of the knee. Most previous studies analyzed posterolateral stability in vitro under static loading conditions. This study aimed to evaluate the contributions of the lateral (fibular) collateral ligament (LCL), popliteofibular ligament (PFL), and popliteus tendon (PT) to cruciate ligament forces under simulated dynamic loading conditions by using selective individual resection. We combined medical imaging and motion capture of healthy subjects (four males and one female) to develop subject-specific knee models that simulated the 12 degrees of freedom of tibiofemoral and patellofemoral joint behaviors. These computational models were validated by comparing electromyographic (EMG) data with muscle activation data and were based on previous experimental studies. A rigid multi-body dynamics simulation using a lower extremity musculoskeletal model was performed to incorporate intact and selective resection of ligaments, based on a novel force-dependent kinematics method, during gait (walking) and squatting. Deficiency of the PLC structures resulted in increased loading on the posterior cruciate ligament and anterior cruciate ligament. Among PLC structures, the PT is the most influential on cruciate ligament forces under dynamic loading conditions.",Viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase mutants display an altered mutation spectrum resulting in attenuation in both mosquito and vertebrate hosts.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30947291,PLoS pathogens,2019 05 17,"The presence of bottlenecks in the transmission cycle of many RNA viruses leads to a severe reduction of number of virus particles and this occurs multiple times throughout the viral transmission cycle. Viral replication is then necessary for regeneration of a diverse mutant swarm. It is now understood that any perturbation of the mutation frequency either by increasing or decreasing the accumulation of mutations in an RNA virus results in attenuation of the virus. To determine if altering the rate at which a virus accumulates mutations decreases the probability of a successful virus infection due to issues traversing host bottlenecks, a series of mutations in the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV), strain 68U201, were tested for mutation rate changes. All RdRp mutants were attenuated in both the mosquito and vertebrate hosts, while showing no attenuation during in vitro infections. The rescued viruses containing these mutations showed some evidence of change in fidelity, but the phenotype was not sustained following passaging. However, these mutants did exhibit changes in the frequency of specific types of mutations. Using a model of mutation production, these changes were shown to decrease the number of stop codons generated during virus replication. This suggests that the observed mutant attenuation in vivo may be due to an increase in the number of unfit genomes, which may be normally selected against by the accumulation of stop codons. Lastly, the ability of these attenuated viruses to transition through a bottleneck in vivo was measured using marked virus clones. The attenuated viruses showed an overall reduction in the number of marked clones for both the mosquito and vertebrate hosts, as well as a reduced ability to overcome the known bottlenecks in the mosquito. This study demonstrates that any perturbation of the optimal mutation frequency whether through changes in fidelity or by alterations in the mutation frequency of specific nucleotides, has significant deleterious effects on the virus, especially in the presence of host bottlenecks.","Death of a close friend: Short and long-term impacts on physical, psychological and social well-being.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30947290,PloS one,2019 04 21,"This paper reports the impact of a major life event-death-on the physical, psychological and social well-being of the deceased's close friends. We utilised data from a large longitudinal survey covering a period of 14 years (2002-2015) consisting a cohort of 26,515 individuals in Australia, of whom 9,586 had experienced the death of at least one close friend. This longitudinal cohort dataset comprises responses to the SF-36 (health related quality of life measure) and allowed for analysis of the short and longer-term impacts of bereavement. In order to manage the heterogeneity of the socio-demographics of respondents who did/not experience a death event, we use a new and robust approach known as the Entropy Balancing method to construct a set of weights applied to the bereaved group and the control group (the group that did not experience death). This approach enables us to match the two groups so that the distribution of socio-demographic variables between the two groups are balanced. These variables included gender, age, marital status, ethnicity, personality traits, religion, relative socio-economic disadvantage, economic resources, and education and occupation and where they resided. The data show, for the first time, a range of negative and enduring consequences experienced by people following the death of a close friend. Significant adverse physical and psychological well-being, poorer mental health and social functioning occur up to four years following bereavement. Bereaved females experienced a sharper fall in vitality, suffered greater deterioration in mental health, impaired emotional and social functioning than the male counterparts up to four years after the death. The data show that the level of social connectedness plays an important role in bereavement outcomes. Specifically, we found that less socially active respondents experienced a longer deterioration in physical and psychological health. Finally, we found evidence that the death of a close friend lowered the respondent's satisfaction with their health. Since death of friends is a universal phenomenon, we conclude the paper by reflecting on the need to recognise the death of a close friend as a substantial experience, and to offer support and services to address this disenfranchised grief. Recognising bereaved friends as a group experiencing adverse outcomes can be used internationally to prompt health and psychological services to assist this specific group, noting that there may be substantial longevity to the negative sequelae of the death of a friend. Facilitating bereaved people's support networks may be a fruitful approach to minimising these negative outcomes.",Gut microbiota from high-risk men who have sex with men drive immune activation in gnotobiotic mice and in vitro HIV infection.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30947289,PLoS pathogens,2019 05 17,"Men who have sex with men (MSM) have differences in immune activation and gut microbiome composition compared with men who have sex with women (MSW), even in the absence of HIV infection. Gut microbiome differences associated with HIV itself when controlling for MSM, as assessed by 16S rRNA sequencing, are relatively subtle. Understanding whether gut microbiome composition impacts immune activation in HIV-negative and HIV-positive MSM has important implications since immune activation has been associated with HIV acquisition risk and disease progression. To investigate the effects of MSM and HIV-associated gut microbiota on immune activation, we transplanted feces from HIV-negative MSW, HIV-negative MSM, and HIV-positive untreated MSM to gnotobiotic mice. Following transplant, 16S rRNA gene sequencing determined that the microbiomes of MSM and MSW maintained distinct compositions in mice and that specific microbial differences between MSM and MSW were replicated. Immunologically, HIV-negative MSM donors had higher frequencies of blood CD38+ HLADR+ and CD103+ T cells and their fecal recipients had higher frequencies of gut CD69+ and CD103+ T cells, compared with HIV-negative MSW donors and recipients, respectively. Significant microbiome differences were not detected between HIV-negative and HIV-positive MSM in this small donor cohort, and immune differences between their recipients were trending but not statistically significant. A larger donor cohort may therefore be needed to detect immune-modulating microbes associated with HIV. To investigate whether our findings in mice could have implications for HIV replication, we infected primary human lamina propria cells stimulated with isolated fecal microbiota, and found that microbiota from MSM stimulated higher frequencies of HIV-infected cells than microbiota from MSW. Finally, we identified several microbes that correlated with immune readouts in both fecal recipients and donors, and with in vitro HIV infection, which suggests a role for gut microbiota in immune activation and potentially HIV acquisition in MSM.",Impact of p53 status on TRAIL-mediated apoptotic and non-apoptotic signaling in cancer cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30947287,PloS one,2019 04 21,"Due to their ability to preferentially induce cell death in tumor cells, while sparing healthy cells, TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) and agonistic anti-TRAIL-R1 or anti-TRAIL-R2-specific antibodies are under clinical investigations for cancer-treatment. However, TRAIL-Rs may also induce signaling pathways, which result in malignant progression. TRAIL receptors are transcriptionally upregulated via wild-type p53 following radio- or chemotherapy. Nevertheless, the impact of p53 status on the expression and signaling of TRAIL-Rs is not fully understood. Therefore, we analyzed side by side apoptotic and non-apoptotic signaling induced by TRAIL or the agonistic TRAIL-R-specific antibodies Mapatumumab (anti-TRAIL-R1) and Lexatumumab (anti-TRAIL-R2) in the two isogenic colon carcinoma cell lines HCT116 p53+/+ and p53-/-. We found that HCT116 p53+/+ cells were significantly more sensitive to TRAIL-R-triggering than p53-/- cells. Similarly, A549 lung cancer cells expressing wild-type p53 were more sensitive to TRAIL-R-mediated cell death than their derivatives with knockdown of p53. Our data demonstrate that the contribution of p53 in regulating TRAIL-R-induced apoptosis does not correlate to the levels of TRAIL-Rs at the plasma membrane, but rather to p53-mediated upregulation of Bax, favouring the mitochondrial amplification loop. Consistently, stronger caspase-9 and caspase-3 activation as well as PARP-cleavage was observed following TRAIL-R-triggering in HCT116 p53+/+ compared to HCT116 p53-/- cells. Interestingly, HCT116 p53+/+ cells showed also a more potent activation of non-canonical TRAIL-R-induced signal transduction pathways like JNK, p38 and ERK1/ERK2 than p53-/- cells. Likewise, these cells induced IL-8 expression in response to TRAIL, Mapatumumab or Lexatumumab significantly stronger than p53-/- cells. We obtained similar results in A549 cells with or without p53-knockdown and in the two isogenic colon cancer cell lines RKO p53+/+ and p53-/-. In both cellular systems, we could clearly demonstrate the potentiating effects of p53 on TRAIL-R-mediated IL-8 induction. In conclusion, we found that wild-type p53 increases TRAIL-R-mediated apoptosis but simultaneously augments non-apoptotic signaling.",Evaluation of blood type as a potential risk factor for early postpartum hemorrhage.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30947286,PloS one,2019 04 21,Studies have demonstrated an association between ABO blood type and bleeding status.

Cyclophosphamide (CYP) is a chemotherapy drug that, after a single dose, elevates murine taste thresholds at times related to drug-induced losses of taste sensory cells and disruptions of proliferating cells that renew taste sensory cells. Pretreatment with amifostine can protect the taste system from many of these effects. This study compared the effects of a single dose (75 mg/kg) of CYP with effects generated by fractionated dosing of CYP (5 doses of 15 mg/kg), a dosing approach often used during chemotherapy, on the taste system of mice using immunohistochemistry. Dose fractionation prolonged the suppressive effects of CYP on cell proliferation responsible for renewal of taste sensory cells. Fractionation also reduced the total number of cells and the proportion of Type II cells within taste buds. The post-injection time of these losses coincided with the life span of Type I and II taste cells combined with lack of replacement cells. Fractionated dosing also decreased Type III cells more than a single dose, but loss of these cells may be due to factors related to the general health and/or cell renewal of taste buds rather than the life span of Type III cells. In general, pretreatment with amifostine appeared to protect taste cell renewal and the population of cells within taste buds from the cytotoxic effects of CYP with few observable adverse effects due to repeated administration. These findings may have important implications for patients undergoing chemotherapy."

Studies in captive-bred macaques show the development of obesity and diabetes with similar complications to humans including eye and kidney diseases, nerve damage associated with pain and blood vessel damage. Diets differ in outcomes and here we document inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract that can be exacerbated through these dietary interventions. Following baseline physiological evaluation of body composition, Southern pigtail macaques were given a high-fat diet (HFD) for three months. This HFD consisted of lard, grains (including gluten), dairy and fructose that was otherwise omitted from a standard macaque diet (Chow). Physiological parameters were then reassessed before animals were reverted back to standard Chow for a further three months (remission). Consumption of the HFD resulted in food-mediated hypersensitivity marked by chronic weight loss, alopecia, malabsorption, protein-losing enteropathy and gross diffuse intestinal villi atrophy and lamina propria hypertrophy. Physiological changes were more highly pronounced in female macaques suggesting sex-specific differences but could be fully reversed through change of diet. Care should be taken in choosing non-human primate HFD diets for creating experimental models of obesity because they can induce severe food-driven chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract that can eventuate to diet-induced chronic wasting and mortality.",Renal insufficiency among urban populations in Bangladesh: A decade of laboratory-based observations.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30947271,PloS one,2019 04 21,"The objective of this study was to describe the age and sex-specific prevalence of renal insufficiency, and observe its trends over a decade at an urban Bangladesh setup.",The use of flipped classroom as an active learning approach improves academic performance in social work: A randomized trial in a university.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30947270,PloS one,2019 04 21,The flipped classroom (FC) is a pedagogical approach that means that the activities that have traditionally taken place within the classroom are carried out outside the classroom.

Parathyroid hormone-related peptide, containing the parathyroid hormone sequence (PTHrP 1-34), enhances cartilage growth during development and inhibits hypertrophic differentiation of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) and growth plate chondrocytes. This study aims to determine the possible anabolic and/or hypertrophic effect of PTH on human articular chondrocytes. Healthy human articular cartilage-derived chondrocytes (n = 6 donors) were cultured on type II collagen-coated transwells with/without 0.1 or 1.0 μM PTH from day 0, 9, or 21 until the end of culture (day 28). Extracellular matrix production, (pre)hypertrophy and PTH signaling were assessed by RT-qPCR and/or immunohistochemistry for collagen type I, II, X, RUNX2, MMP13, PTHR1 and IHH and by determining glycosaminoglycan production and DNA content. The Bern score assessed cartilage quality by histology. Regardless of the concentration and initiation of supplementation, PTH treatment significantly decreased DNA and glycosaminoglycan content and reduced the Bern score compared with controls. Type I collagen deposition was increased, whereas PTHR1 expression and type II collagen deposition were decreased by PTH supplementation. Expression of the (pre)hypertrophic markers MMP13, RUNX2, IHH and type X collagen were not affected by PTH. In conclusion, PTH supplementation to healthy human articular chondrocytes did not affect hypertrophic differentiation, but negatively influenced cartilage quality, the tissues' extracellular matrix and cell content. Although PTH may be an effective inhibitor of hypertrophic differentiation in MSC-based cartilage repair, care may be warranted in applying accessory PTH treatment due to its effects on articular chondrocytes.",First clinical isolate of Escherichia coli harboring mcr-1 gene in Mexico.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30947268,PloS one,2019 04 21,"Our aim in this report was to describe the characteristics of the first clinical isolate of Escherichia coli (EC-PAG-733) harboring the mcr-1 gene found in Mexico. This isolate was obtained from a fecal sample from a young child with an oncological condition. We obtained the whole-genome sequence using next-generation sequencing and analyzed the sequence by bioinformatics tools. EC-PAG-733 was resistant to third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins and was susceptible to all carbapenems and amikacin; it was also resistant to ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, gentamicin and colistin at a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 4 μg/mL. This isolate was classified as O11:H25-ST457. EC-PAG-733 harbored an ESBL type CTX-M-55 as well as several virulence factors that have been associated with Enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAEC).

The aims of the present study were to evaluate the use of intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) of 45 Gy in 20 fractions to compensate for the dose heterogeneity in gross tumor volume observed with single-fraction BNCT with mean prescription dose 19 Gy (w), and to evaluate planning quality indices of simulated BNCT+IMRT versus single-fraction BNCT alone. All IMRT plans were generated using the Eclipse TPS which employs the analytical anisotropic algorithm. The conformity index for the gross tumor volume (GTV) was better for the BNCT+IMRT plan than for the BNCT-alone plan (p = 0.003). In addition, the BNCT+IMRT plan provided significantly better homogeneity in the GTV (p = 0.03). The cold spots in inhomogeneous dose distribution in the BNCT plan may be a key factor for H&N cancer recurrence. Our results suggest that single-fraction BNCT combined with compensated multi-fraction IMRT improves treatment homogeneity and conformity than single-fraction BNCT alone, especially for tumor volumes >100 cm3, and possibly increases local tumor control.",Investigation of the spatial heterogeneity of soil microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen under long-term fertilizations in fluvo-aquic soil.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30947266,PloS one,2019 04 21,"Soils are heterogeneous and microbial spatial distribution can clearly indicate the spatial characteristics of the soil carbon and nitrogen cycle. However, it is not clear how long-term fertilization affects the spatial distribution of microbial biomass in fluvo-aquic soil. We collected fluvo-aquic soil samples (topsoil 0-7.5 cm and sub-topsoil 7.5-20 cm) using a spatially-explicit design within three 40.5 m2 plots in each of four fertilization treatments. Fertilization treatments were: cropping without fertilizer inputs (CK); chemical nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium fertilizer (NPK); chemical fertilizer with straw return (NPKS); and chemical fertilizer with animal manure (NPKM). Variables included soil microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and nitrogen (MBN), and MBC/MBN. For both soil layers, we hypothesized that: microbial biomass was lowest in CK but with the largest spatial heterogeneity; and microbial biomass was highest in NPKM and NPKS but with the lowest spatial heterogeneity. Results showed that: (1) Fertilization significantly increased MBC and MBN more in topsoil than sub-topsoil but had no MBC/MBN changes. (2) The coefficient of variation (CV) and Cochran's C showed that variation was largest in CK in topsoil and NPK in sub-topsoil and that variation of topsoil was generally lower than in sub-topsoil. The sample size of the three variables was largest in CK in topsoil but had little variation among the other treatments. (3) The trend-surface model showed that within-plot heterogeneity varied substantially with fertilization (NPKM = NPK > NPKS > CK), but Moran's I and the interpolation map showed that spatial variability with fertilization followed the order NPK > NPKS > CK = NPKM at a fine scale in topsoil. In sub-topsoil, the trend-surface model showed that within-plot heterogeneity followed the order NPKM = CK > NPK > NPKS and that the fine-scale pattern was NPKM>NPK = NPKS>CK. MBC had the highest spatial heterogeneity among the three variables in both soil layers. Our results indicate that the application of organic fertilizer (straw or manure) reduced the variation of MBC and MBN but increased the spatial variability of MBC and MBN. The spatial variation of the three variables was MBC > MBN > MBC/MBN regardless of whether variation was considered at the plot-scale or the fine-scale in both layers.",The emerging burden of liver disease in cystic fibrosis patients: A UK nationwide study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30947265,PloS one,2019 04 21,Cystic fibrosis associated liver disease (CFLD) is the third largest cause of mortality in CF.

These isotherms have been interpreted considering the monolayer as a two dimensional ideal or van der Waals gas without contact with the water phase. These modelistic approaches do not fit the experimental results. Based on Thermodynamics of Irreversible Processes (TIP), the expansion/compression process is interpreted in terms of coupled phenomena between area changes and water fluxes between a bidimensional solution of hydrated head groups in the monolayer and the bulk solution. The formalism obtained can reproduce satisfactorily the surface pressure/area per lipid isotherms of monolayer in different states and also can explain the area expansion and compression produced in particles enclosed by bilayers during osmotic fluxes. This novel approach gives relevance to the lipid-water interaction in restricted media near the membrane and provides a formalism to understand the thermodynamic and kinetic response of biointerphases to biological effectors."

We then assess the extent to which hardships related to the Great Recession account for the growing social disparity in economic distress. Based on the concept of loss aversion, we also test whether the psychological pain associated with a financial loss is greater than the perceived benefit of an equivalent gain. Analyses are based on longitudinal survey data from the Midlife Development in the US study. Results suggest that widening social disparities in perceived economic distress between the mid-2000s and mid-2010s are explained in part by differential exposure to hardships related to the Great Recession, the effects of which have lingered even four to five years after the recession officially ended. Yet, auxiliary analyses show that the socioeconomic disparities in economic distress widened by nearly as much (if not more) during the period from 1995-96 to 2004-05 as they did during the period in which the recession occurred, which suggests that the factors driving these trends may have already been in motion prior to the recession. Consistent with the loss aversion hypothesis, perceptions of financial strain appear to be somewhat more strongly affected by losses in income/assets than by gains, but the magnitude of the differentials are small and the results are not robust. Our findings paint a dismal portrait of a growing socioeconomic divide in economic distress throughout the period from the mid-1990s to the mid-2010s, although we cannot say whether these trends afflict all regions of the US equally.

Thus, the probable risk factors and association between these factors and motorcycle crash severity outcomes is not known. Traditional statistical models have intrinsic assumptions and pre-defined correlations that, if flouted, can generate inaccurate results. In this study, machine learning based algorithms were employed to predict and classify motorcycle crash severity. Machine learning based techniques are non-parametric models without the presumption of relationships between endogenous and exogenous variables. The main aim of this research is to evaluate and compare different approaches to modeling motorcycle crash severity as well as investigating the effect of risk factors on the injury outcomes of motorcycle crashes. Motorcycle crash dataset between 2011 and 2015 was extracted from the National Road Traffic Crash Database at the Building and Road Research Institute (BRRI) in Ghana. The dataset was classified into four injury severity categories: fatal, hospitalized, injured, and damage-only. Three machine learning based models were developed: J48 Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest (RF) and Instance-Based learning with parameter k (IBk) were employed to model the severity of injury in a motorcycle crash. These machine learning algorithms were validated using 10-fold cross-validation technique. The three machine learning based algorithms were compared with one another and the statistical model: multinomial logit model (MNLM). Also, the relative importance analysis of the attribute was conducted to determine the impact of these attributes on injury severity outcomes. The results of the study reveal that the predictions of machine learning algorithms are superior to the MNLM in accuracy and effectiveness, and the RF-based algorithms show the overall best agreement with the experimental data out of the three machine learning algorithms, for its global optimization and extrapolation ability. Location type, time of the crash, settlement type, collision partner, collision type, road separation, road surface type, the day of the week, and road shoulder condition were found as the critical determinants of motorcycle crash injury severity.",Comparing the effects of asynchronous herbivores on New Zealand montane vegetation communities.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30947249,PloS one,2019 04 21,"Large herbivores facilitate a range of important ecological processes yet globally have experienced high rates of decline and extinction over the past 50,000 years. To some extent this lost function may be replaced through the introduction of ecological surrogate taxa, either by active management or via historic introductions. However, comparing the ecological effects of herbivores that existed in the same location, but at different times, can be a challenging proposition. Here we provide an example from New Zealand that demonstrates an approach for making such comparisons. In New Zealand it has been suggested that post-19th Century mammal introductions (e.g. deer and hare) may have filled ecological niches left vacant after the 15th Century AD extinction of large avian herbivores (moa). We quantified pollen assemblages from fecal samples deposited by these two asynchronous herbivore communities to see whether they were comparable. The fecal samples were collected at the same location, and in a native-dominated vegetation community that has experience little anthropogenic disturbance and their contents reflect both the local habitat and diet preferences of the depositing herbivore. The results reveal that the current forest understory is relatively sparse and species depauperate compared to the prehistoric state, indicating that deer and moa had quite different impacts on the local vegetation community.

Previous studies have showed that long-term CCH training has positive effects physically (induced by handwriting activities) and psychologically (induced by the state of relaxation and concentration), the latter of which is similar to the effects of meditation. The aim of this study was to investigate the long-term CCH training effect on anxiety and attention, as well as brain structure. Participants were 32 individuals who had at least five years of CCH experience and 44 controls. Results showed that CCH training benefited individuals' selective and divided attention but did not decrease their anxiety level. Moreover, the VBM analysis showed that long-term CCH training was mainly associated with smaller grey matter volumes (GMV) in the right precuneus/posterior cingulate cortex (PCC). No brain areas showed larger GMV in the CCH group than the control group. Using two sets of regions of interest (ROIs), one related to meditation and the other to handwriting, ROI analysis showed significant differences between the CCH and the control group only at the meditation-related ROIs, not at the handwriting-related ROIs. Finally, for the whole sample, the GMV of both the whole brain and the PCC were negatively correlated with selective attention and divided attention. The present study was cross-sectional and had a relatively small sample size, but its results suggested that CCH training might benefit attention and influence particular brain structure through mental processes such as meditation.","Goiter and its associated factors among primary school children aged 6-12 years in Anchar district, Eastern Ethiopia.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30947246,PloS one,2019 04 21,"Goiter is a major public health problem in Ethiopia.

Despite their ubiquitous use, individual neuronal responses measured with these microscopes have not been directly compared to those obtained with established in vivo imaging techniques such as bench-top two-photon microscopes. To achieve this, we performed calcium imaging in mouse primary visual cortex while presenting animals with drifting gratings. We identified the same neurons in image stacks acquired with both microscopy methods and quantified orientation tuning of individual neurons. The response amplitude and signal-to-noise ratio of calcium transients recorded upon visual stimulation were highly correlated between both microscopy methods, although influenced by neuropil contamination in miniaturized microscopy. Tuning properties, calculated for individual orientation tuned neurons, were strongly correlated between imaging techniques. Thus, neuronal tuning features measured with a miniaturized microscope are quantitatively similar to those obtained with a two-photon microscope.",Trichophyton rubrum LysM proteins bind to fungal cell wall chitin and to the N-linked oligosaccharides present on human skin glycoproteins.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30947244,PloS one,2019 04 21,"The Trichophyton rubrum genome contains six proteins containing two or more lysin M (LysM) domains.

We have characterized the individual LysM domains in LysM1, and shown that the protein contains two functional LysM domains. Each of these domains can bind to chitin, to N-linked oligosaccharides in human skin glycoproteins, and to N-linked oligosaccharides on fungal glycoproteins. We hypothesize that LysM proteins could provide the pathogen with three important functions. First, the T. rubrum LysM proteins could shield host cell wall chitin from the human immune system. Second, the LysM proteins could shield the pathogen's glycoproteins from host degradation and immune surveillance. Third, the LysM proteins could help facilitate pathogen adhesion to human skin.",An in vivo pharmacological study: Variation in tissue-accumulation for the drug probucol as the result of targeted microtechnology and matrix-acrylic acid optimization and stabilization techniques.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30947243,PloS one,2019 04 21,"Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is characterised by β-cell damage and hyperglycaemia. The lipophilic drug, probucol, has shown significant β-cell protective and potential antidiabetic effects, which were enhanced by hydrophilic bile acid incorporation using taurocholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid. However, probucol has severe cardiotoxicity and a variable absorption profile, which limit its potential applications in T2D. Accordingly, this study aimed to design multiple formulations to optimise probucol oral delivery in T2D and test their effects on probucol absorption and accumulation in the heart. Adult male mice were given a high fat diet (HFD), and a week later, injected with a single dose of alloxan to accelerate T2D development, and once diabetes confirmed, divided into three groups (six to seven mice each). The groups were gavaged a daily dose of probucol powder, probucol microcapsules, or probucol-bile acid microcapsules for three months, and euthanized; and blood, tissues, and feces collected for blood glucose and probucol concentration analyses. Probucol concentrations in plasma were similar among all the groups. Groups given probucol microcapsules and probucol-bile acid microcapsules showed significant reduction in probucol accumulation in the heart compared with the group given probucol powder (p<0.05). Probucol microencapsulation with or without bile acids reduced its accumulation in heart tissues, without changing plasma concentrations, which may be beneficial in reducing its cardiotoxicity and optimise its potential applications in T2D."

However, a major problem with broader implementation of personalised medicine is patient access to new drugs, devices and treatments. The fact that a new medicine or innovative product can sometimes take as long as 20 years to get from bench to bedside is not only clearly undesirable but is arguably unacceptable in the 21st century. This paper looks in detail at the issues surrounding development, continued investment, risk factors, testing and approval from both the industry perspective as well as that of the assessor and the decision maker/payer. It becomes clear that there is a lack of working in tandem that results in a double time frame (two times 10 years). This is simply because the key stakeholders, surprisingly, do not synergise their assessments of a new product. As well as causing delays in patient access, this can also affect investment confidence as industry waits too long for approval for its product to reach the market and its subsequent implementation into healthcare. Such a slow process undermines continued investment and contributes to a risk-averse environment, which in turn can have an impact on innovation. The solution appears to be uncomplicated, involving better coordination and collaboration between the different stakeholders working at various stages within the bench-to-bedside timeframe. We take the example of the network of the European Alliance for Personalised Medicine (EAPM) to demonstrate possible solutions using an innovative approach.",Spinal Cord Stimulation for Restless Legs Syndrome: Case Series and Mechanistic Hypothesis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30947223,Stereotactic and functional neurosurgery,2019 05 07,"Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is a well-established therapy for chronic pain syndromes, with growing applicability to other conditions.

We tested 35 patients affected by PD and 42 matched healthy controls in an oddball paradigm, using frequency and duration deviant stimuli to measure auditory MMN. PD patients displayed reduced duration MMN amplitudes in comparison to healthy controls. No group differences were detected for duration MMN latency, as well as frequency MMN indices.

Panic attacks may cause or contribute to acute or episodic vestibular symptoms. Generalized anxiety and depression do the same for chronic vestibular symptoms. Fear of falling causes considerable functional impairment, particularly in the elderly. Persistent postural-perceptual dizziness, a newly defined functional vestibular disorder that was 145 years in the making, is the most common cause of chronic dizziness in neurotologic practice. These 5 disorders are the primary diagnoses in 8-10% of patients who consult neurologists or otologists for vestibular symptoms and may be present in up to 50% of patients with structural vestibular disorders.

The utility of the monothermal caloric screen has been proposed in various studies. When appropriate cut-offs are used, the monothermal screen can be completed with a low false-negative rate. Air is often used as a medium for caloric testing, though not without some controversy. When air and water are compared, the response magnitudes for air are consistently smaller than for water. However, the overall classification of the result appears to be generally the same regardless of the caloric medium used. Posturography: Concerns have been raised about the reliability and validity of posturographic measurements. Approaches and analysis techniques vary widely, and there is little consensus regarding the best approaches for assessment or interpretation. There is a need for standardized protocols. The portable and low-cost Nintendo Wii Balance Board (WBB) has inspired a surge in publications looking at the validity of the system for quantifying posturography and for balance training; preliminary findings are very promising."

The SVV/H test in peripheral lesions probes static asymmetries in utricular function and represents a perceptual error in perceived gravitational vertical/horizontal. VEMPs and SVV/H enable the characterization of patterns and severity of otolith dysfunction in common vestibular disorders. Combined with tests of semicircular canal function, they provide a useful tool for eliciting diagnostic profiles in vestibular neuritis and Ménière's disease.

Such an RTM, denoted as [Formula: see text], has a sizable reduction (enhancement) as a moderate tensile strain is applied in a parallel (perpendicular) direction. For example, when the strain strength amounts to 7%, [Formula: see text] the two distinct cases of the strain applied in x and y  directions differ from each other by roughly two times. In contrast, the RTM in armchair direction is not so sensitive to a tensile strain. The underlying mechanism for such a strain effect on the mobility is then analysed in depth.

The newly developed EXIRAD-3D autoradiography technique (MILabs B.V.) based on a highly focusing multi-pinhole collimator achieves micron-resolution SPECT for cryo-cooled tissue samples. For such high resolutions, the choice of pinhole material may have a significant impact on images. Therefore, this paper aims to compare the performance of EXIRAD-3D with lead, tungsten, gold, and depleted uranium pinhole collimators designed such that they achieve equal sensitivities. Performance in terms of resolution is characterized for several radioisotopes, namely 111In (171 keV and 245 keV), 99mTc (140 keV), 201Tl (71 keV), and 125I (27 keV). Using Monte Carlo simulation, point spread functions were generated and their profiles as well as their full-width-at-half-maximum and full-width-at-tenth-maximum were determined and evaluated for different materials and isotopes. Additionally, simulated reconstructions of a Derenzo resolution phantom, validated with experimental data, were judged by assessment of the resolvable rods as well as a contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) analysis. Our results indicate that using materials with higher photon-stopping power yields images with better CNR for the studied isotopes with improvements ranging from 1.9% to 36.6%.

Grain growth mechanisms driven by grain rotation, grain boundary curvature, and disorder are discussed.",The matrix environmental and cell mechanical properties regulate cell migration and contribute to the invasive phenotype of cancer cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30947151,Reports on progress in physics. Physical Society (Great Britain),2019 05 31,"The minimal structural unit of a solid tumor is a single cell or a cellular compartment such as the nucleus. A closer look inside the cells reveals that there are functional compartments or even structural domains determining the overall properties of a cell such as the mechanical phenotype. The mechanical interaction of these living cells leads to the complex organization such as compartments, tissues and organs of organisms including mammals. In contrast to passive non-living materials, living cells actively respond to the mechanical perturbations occurring in their microenvironment during diseases such as fibrosis and cancer. The transformation of single cancer cells in highly aggressive and hence malignant cancer cells during malignant cancer progression encompasses the basement membrane crossing, the invasion of connective tissue, the stroma microenvironments and transbarrier migration, which all require the immediate interaction of the aggressive and invasive cancer cells with the surrounding extracellular matrix environment including normal embedded neighboring cells. All these steps of the metastatic pathway seem to involve mechanical interactions between cancer cells and their microenvironment. The pathology of cancer due to a broad heterogeneity of cancer types is still not fully understood. Hence it is necessary to reveal the signaling pathways such as mechanotransduction pathways that seem to be commonly involved in the development and establishment of the metastatic and mechanical phenotype in several carcinoma cells. We still do not know whether there exist distinct metastatic genes regulating the progression of tumors. These metastatic genes may then be activated either during the progression of cancer by themselves on their migration path or in earlier stages of oncogenesis through activated oncogenes or inactivated tumor suppressor genes, both of which promote the metastatic phenotype. In more detail, the adhesion of cancer cells to their surrounding stroma induces the generation of intracellular contraction forces that deform their microenvironments by alignment of fibers. The amplitude of these forces can adapt to the mechanical properties of the microenvironment. Moreover, the adhesion strength of cancer cells seems to determine whether a cancer cell is able to migrate through connective tissue or across barriers such as the basement membrane or endothelial cell linings of blood or lymph vessels in order to metastasize. In turn, exposure of adherent cancer cells to physical forces, such as shear flow in vessels or compression forces around tumors, reinforces cell adhesion, regulates cell contractility and restructures the ordering of the local stroma matrix that leads subsequently to secretion of crosslinking proteins or matrix degrading enzymes. Hence invasive cancer cells alter the mechanical properties of their microenvironment. From a mechanobiological point-of-view, the recognized physical signals are transduced into biochemical signaling events that guide cellular responses such as cancer progression after the malignant transition of cancer cells from an epithelial and non-motile phenotype to a mesenchymal and motile (invasive) phenotype providing cellular motility. This transition can also be described as the physical attempt to relate this cancer cell transitional behavior to a T1 phase transition such as the jamming to unjamming transition. During the invasion of cancer cells, cell adaptation occurs to mechanical alterations of the local stroma, such as enhanced stroma upon fibrosis, and therefore we need to uncover underlying mechano-coupling and mechano-regulating functional processes that reinforce the invasion of cancer cells. Moreover, these mechanisms may also be responsible for the awakening of dormant residual cancer cells within the microenvironment. Physicists were initially tempted to consider the steps of the cancer metastasis cascade as single events caused by a single mechanical alteration of the overall properties of the cancer cell. However, this general and simple view has been challenged by the finding that several mechanical properties of cancer cells and their microenvironment influence each other and continuously contribute to tumor growth and cancer progression. In addition, basement membrane crossing, cell invasion and transbarrier migration during cancer progression is explained in physical terms by applying physical principles on living cells regardless of their complexity and individual differences of cancer types. As a novel approach, the impact of the individual microenvironment surrounding cancer cells is also included. Moreover, new theories and models are still needed to understand why certain cancers are malignant and aggressive, while others stay still benign. However, due to the broad variety of cancer types, there may be various pathways solely suitable for specific cancer types and distinct steps in the process of cancer progression. In this review, physical concepts and hypotheses of cancer initiation and progression including cancer cell basement membrane crossing, invasion and transbarrier migration are presented and discussed from a biophysical point-of-view. In addition, the crosstalk between cancer cells and a chronically altered microenvironment, such as fibrosis, is discussed including the basic physical concepts of fibrosis and the cellular responses to mechanical stress caused by the mechanically altered microenvironment. Here, is highlighted how biophysical approaches, both experimentally and theoretically, have an impact on classical hallmarks of cancer and fibrosis and how they contribute to the understanding of the regulation of cancer and its progression by sensing and responding to the physical environmental properties through mechanotransduction processes. Finally, this review discusses various physical models of cell migration such as blebbing, nuclear piston, protrusive force and unjamming transition migration modes and how they contribute to cancer progression. Moreover, these cellular migration modes are influenced by microenvironmental perturbances such as fibrosis that can induce mechanical alterations in cancer cells, which in turn may impact the environment. Hence, the classical hallmarks of cancer need to be refined by including biomechanical properties of cells, cell clusters and tissues and their microenvironment to understand mechano-regulatory processes within cancer cells and the entire organism.",Disorder-induced localisation and suppression of superconductivity in YSr2Cu3O6+x.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30947150,Journal of physics. Condensed matter : an Institute of Physics journal,2019 05 09,"By means of ab initio calculations within the local density approximation to density functional theory, we investigate the electronic structure of the 60 K superconductor YSr2Cu3O6+x (YSCO). We focus on the effects of the Sr/Ba substitution and on the main structural modifications induced by this substitution experimentally found in the Sr compound, namely the tetragonal symmetry and the oxygen disorder in the basal plane. In the calculations, this disorder is simulated by using a supercell approach. Due to band structure effects, we find a larger stabilisation free energy of the orthorhombic structure in YBa2Cu3O6+x (YBCO). In YSCO, the tetragonal disordered phase is found to be stabilized by oxygen overdoping (x  >  1) and by sufficiently large mass-enhancement factors, [Formula: see text]. The analysis of the atomic site projected density of states suggests that oxygen disorder in the CuO basal planes of YSCO induces hole localisation, which accounts for the large 30 K reduction of [Formula: see text] with respect to YBCO.",Quantum interference of Josephson current in topological Anderson insulator junctions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30947149,Journal of physics. Condensed matter : an Institute of Physics journal,2019 05 09,"We investigate the critical supercurrent in Josephson junctions consisting of topological Anderson insulators (TAIs) via the Matsubara Green's function formalism. Our numerical results show that the disorder-induced edge states display distinct differences in dominating normal and supercurrent transport in the TAI phase. Unlike the hallmark of the TAI phase which exhibits a quantized conductance plateau, the critical supercurrent over the disorder strength exhibits a peak structure where the maximum value is reached at the weak-disorder boundary of the TAI phase. Although the magnitude of the averaged critical supercurrent is suppressed with increasing disorder strength, periodic oscillations of the supercurrent on an external magnetic flux survive in the TAI phase. These findings indicate that the supercurrent quantum interference effect can be an effective probe in detecting the emergence of disorder-induced edge state in TAIs.",The role of radiation protection professionals in the landscape of low dose radiation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30947148,Journal of radiological protection : official journal of the Society for Radiological Protection,2019 04 04,"Radiation protection professionals benefit from using and applying a robust system of radiological protection that has evolved and matured through decades of research and experience. Nevertheless, uncertainties in potential health effects from low doses and low dose rates of radiation continue to remain. This uncertainty, coupled with complex jargon and nuances, has created an environment where the system of radiological protection can be misrepresented, even by radiation safety professionals, and by extension, misunderstood by the public. While it is universally agreed that the linear-no-threshold model cannot adequately explain or predict health effects of low dose radiation for all cancers, all individuals, or all exposure situations, the recommendation of authoritative scientific bodies to use this model for managing risks of radiation exposure is unequivocal. The role of individual radiation protection professionals in communicating radiation health and risk information is critical and consistent with the primary objective of professional organizations that represent them, mainly to promote best science and practice of radiation protection. If radiation protection professionals provide advice contrary to the recommendations and advice of regulatory and authoritative scientific bodies, it can erode public confidence in the system of radiological protection and harm the credibility of our profession.",Manipulating the particle-hole symmetry of quasiparticle bound states in geometric-size-varying Fe clusters on one-unit-cell FeSe/SrTiO3(0 0 1).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30947147,Journal of physics. Condensed matter : an Institute of Physics journal,2019 05 09,"The particle-hole symmetry (PHS) of quasiparticle bound states, which is generally expected in theory, is present or absent experimentally in a seemingly irregular manner, with the physical origin little understood yet. Here, we report a study on the bound states induced by Fe clusters with different sizes on one-unit-cell (1-UC) FeSe/SrTiO3(0 0 1) by in situ scanning tunneling spectroscopy. Statistically, on the larger-scale cluster, a pair of bias-symmetric minipeaks are detected within the superconducting-gap energies. As increasing temperature, the minipeak states show negligible energy dispersion. The temperature-independent bias-symmetric minipeaks are identified as the quasiparticle bound states that preserve the PHS. However, on the smaller-scale cluster, the bound state appears as a single resonance instead. These results reveal a geometric-size-tuning effect of the PHS, which may help reconcile the contradiction between the superconductivity theory and the PHS-breaking experiments."

Herein, we present a novel modified carbon paste electrode (CPE) with a selective molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) for recognition of sesquiterpene β-caryophyllene, constituted of important plants oil-resins and extracts. The non-covalent MIP was synthesized using AA, EGDMA, and AIBN as a functional monomer, cross-linker and initiator agent, respectively. Structural and chemical characterization of the synthesized MIP was conducted through scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). It was possible to verify the functional features of the synthesized MIP related to the extraction process of the template molecule. The CPE modified with MIP for sesquiterpene β-caryophyllene recognition was characterized by electrochemical techniques as cyclic voltammetry (CV) and square wave voltammetry (SWV). The highest selective recognition electrode enables to detect concentrations in the range between 1.5 × 10-7 and 7.5 × 10-7 M, showing great potential for applications in monitoring content of sesquiterpene β-caryophyllene in technological processes and for predicting the quality of extracts, oils, and resins of plants.",Investigation of mineralogical and bacteria diversity in Nanxi River affected by acid mine drainage from the closed coal mine: Implications for characterizing natural attenuation process.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30947135,"Spectrochimica acta. Part A, Molecular and biomolecular spectroscopy",2019 04 27,"Due to the supply-side reform and environmental protection in China, many small coal mines have been closed since 2015. However, acid mine drainage from these coal mines are continuously discharging into many rural creeks, which requires the systematical investigation on the variations of geochemical and environmental biological aspects in these water systems. In this study, from a classic acid mine drainage (AMD) from a closed coal mine of Hunan, China, various sediments and water samples in different sections were collected and analyzed. According to the corresponding Mineralogical and simple bacterial characteristics analysis (16S rRNA gene sequencing), the main findings were: 1) Secondary iron-containing minerals gradually transited from Gr(CO32-) (green rust), Sh (schwertmannite) to Akg (Akaganeite) and more stable Gt (Goethite); 2) compared to the pristine sediment, these minerals decreased the acid-neutralizing capacity and cation exchange capacity (CEC) of sediments; 3) Proteobacteria and Firmicutes were the dominant phyla and the obvious variation of Firmicutes species was observed in the creek affected by AMD, which probably could been a biological index to diagnose the natural attenuation of AMD. These results could be greatly significant to understand typical variations of creek attenuation and bacterial community in the presence of high metal and sulfate concentration.",Development of near infrared spectroscopy methodology for human albumin determination using a new calibration approach.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30947134,"Spectrochimica acta. Part A, Molecular and biomolecular spectroscopy",2019 04 27,"Though near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) has been applied widely in the field of pharmaceutical, there is still a bottleneck which limits its development. The main barrier is that conventional NIRS calibration method is based on experiences and trials, which causes the established model is not stable and difficult to explain. Therefore, a new strategy which was based on design of experiment (DoE) combined with statistical analysis was provided to solve the limitations. A pre-processing method library was set up first and orthogonal experiment design was then introduced to investigate the effects and interactions of different pre-processing methods. Paired t-test was used to select the most suitable pre-processing method. Finally, the pre-processing method selected above and three commonly used variable selection methods (CARS, UVE, VIP) were combined randomly to select the best calibration model. The results showed that the new calibration approach could provide a reasonable way for researchers to establish a more stable, objective calibration model.",Fluorescence turn-on sensing of L-cysteine based on FRET between Au-Ag nanoclusters and Au nanorods.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30947133,"Spectrochimica acta. Part A, Molecular and biomolecular spectroscopy",2019 04 27,"The applications of metallic nanoclusters and nanoparticles in biological sensing have attracted special attention owing to their optical interaction based on fluorescence and surface plasmon resonance (SPR). In this work, we designed a fluorescent nanoprobe for the determination of L-cysteine (L-Cys) based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) from gold‑silver bimetallic nanoclusters (Au-Ag NCs) to gold nanorods (AuNRs). Firstly, the negatively charged Au-Ag NCs protected by bovine serum albumin (BSA) are directly adsorbed on the surface of the positively charged AuNRs through electrostatic interaction, and the FRET effect leads to distinct fluorescence quenching of Au-Ag NCs at 615nm. The SPR wavelength of AuNRs is dependent on the aspect ratio, so the SPR of AuNRs could be tuned to have a better spectral overlap with fluorescence of Au-Ag NCs, which enhances the fluorescence quenching effect. Because the SH group of L-Cys has an affinity with gold, the addition of L-Cys can result in the release of Au-Ag NCs from the surface of AuNRs via forming AuS bonds. Thus, the introduction of L-Cys could effectively restore the fluorescence emission of the AuNRs/Au-Ag NCs system because of the restraint of FRET effect. Under the optimized conditions, the fluorescence recovery of AuNRs/Au-Ag NCs probe exhibits a linear response to L-Cys concentration ranging from 5 to 100μM, and the corresponding theoretical detection limit (LOD) is 1.73μM. Meanwhile, this method displays excellent sensitivity and selectivity for L-Cys over other amino acids, and it has been successfully applied to detect L-Cys in real samples.","Effects of methylation in acceptors on the hydrogen bond complexes between 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol and cyclic ethers.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30947132,"Spectrochimica acta. Part A, Molecular and biomolecular spectroscopy",2019 04 29,"In order to explore the effect of methylation on the stability and spectral shift of hydrogen bond complexes, the complexes of 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol (TFE) with propylene oxide (PO) and isobutylene oxide (IBO) were investigated by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and ab initio computations. The comparable OH-stretching red shifts were observed upon complexation, and an enhancement of the OH-stretching band is shown with the partial pressure of monomers increasing. The OH-stretching frequency of TFE is red shifted by 180 and 201 cm-1 with PO and IBO, respectively. By using quantum chemical calculations, we predicted the geometric parameters, binding energies, and spectral shifts of TFEPO/IBO hydrogen bond complexes. The calculated and observed spectral shifts follow the same trends. Compared with the TFEethylene oxide (EO) complex, the strength of the hydrogen bond in complex increases with the addition of methyl group, which likely results from the increase in basicity of the hydrogen bond acceptor. By combining the experimental integrated absorbance and the calculated IR intensity of the OH-stretching vibrational transition, the equilibrium constant for the complex formation was determined. In addition, atoms-in-molecules (AIM) and natural bond orbital (NBO) analyses were carried out to explain the red shift and the nature of the interaction in these complexes.",Rapid determination of sulfonamides in chicken using two-dimensional online cleanup mode with three columns coupled to liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30947131,"Journal of chromatography.

Different experimental processes containing extraction, purification, separation, and detection have been evaluated respectively to obtain optimized parameters. The developed method was fully validated and the efficient and superior performance of the developed method was demonstrated. The method produced linear results for all sulfonamides from 1 to 10 ng g-1 with a linearity >0.99. The intra-day precision of the method was <8.45% while the inter-day precision was <9.11%. The matrix effect was 77.5% to 105.1%. The recovery was in the range of 72.66% to 116.7% for all sulfonamides.

The aim of this study was to investigate whether the stability of meropenem was improved in dried blood spots (DBS) and whether sample transport between clinic and laboratory could be simplified by using this medium. Meropenem was quantified in DBS punch-out discs after extraction into acetonitrile - water (70:30 v:v) containing the internal standard D6-meropenem. The extracts were analyzed by hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). The calibration function was linear in the range of 0.5-50 μg/mL. Intra-day coefficients of variation were better than 12% with accuracies better than 5%. The corresponding inter-day values were better than 7% and 6%, respectively.

Each individual was evaluated with an executive protocol developed for people with intellectual disabilities and was rated for behaviors related to frontal lobe dysfunction (disinhibition, executive dysfunction, and apathy) by an informant using the Frontal Systems Behavior Scale. Informant-reported behaviors related to frontal lobe dysfunction were found to correlate negatively with executive function performance. Disinhibition and executive dysfunction were associated with the clinical stage of dementia. The odds of having Alzheimer's disease increased in parallel with increases in the domain and total Frontal Systems Behavior Scale scores (p ≤ 0.5).

We used preprocessed data from fully automated Roche Elecsys immunoassays. A series of linear regressions were used to examine cross-sectional effects of Aβ1-42, sex, and APOEε4 on baseline CSF tau and linear mixed models for longitudinal changes in CSF tau. Cross-sectionally, CSF t-tau and p-tau were associated with abnormal Aβ1-42 and APOEε4 but not with sex. Longitudinally, low baseline CSF Aβ1-42 levels, but not APOEε4 or sex, predicted faster p-tau accumulation. The relationship between baseline CSF Aβ1-42 and tau accumulation was strongest in APOEε4 carriers, and particularly female carriers, relative to other groups. The current findings support an association between baseline CSF Aβ1-42 and changes in CSF tau. Elevated risk in females, apparent only in carriers, reinforces findings of sex-related vulnerability in those with genetic predisposition for Alzheimer's disease.",Mild cognitive impairment reverters have a favorable cognitive prognosis and cortical integrity in Parkinson's disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30947112,Neurobiology of aging,2019 06 13,"This study aimed to investigate whether reversion to cognitively normal status (CogN) is related to a favorable cognitive prognosis in Parkinson's disease with mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI).

Our results suggest that PD-MCI reverters have relatively preserved structural and functional integrity and a favorable cognitive prognosis compared with nonreverters.",Optimizing dosing of nitrofurantoin from a PK/PD point of view: What do we need to know?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30947111,Drug resistance updates : reviews and commentaries in antimicrobial and anticancer chemotherapy,2019 05 15,"Nitrofurantoin is an old antibiotic and an important first-line oral antibiotic for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections. However despite its long term use for over 60 years, little information is available with respect to its dose justification and this may be the reason of highly variable recommended doses and dosing schedules. Furthermore, nitrofurantoin is not a uniform product -crystal sizes of nitrofurantoin, and therefore pharmacokinetic properties, differ significantly by product. Moreover, pharmacokinetic profiling of some products is even lacking, or difficult to interpret because of its unstable chemical properties. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data is now slowly becoming available. This review provides an overview of nitrofurantoins antibacterial, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties. This shows that a clear rationale of current dosing regimens is scanty.",Effect of dihydroartemisinin on epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in canine mammary tumour cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30947110,Research in veterinary science,2019 05 27,"Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a process by which epithelial cells acquire mesenchymal properties, generating metastases. Dihydroartemisinin (DHA) exhibits potent anti-cancer activities. CMTs is a potential suitable model for studies in human breast cancer research. In the present study, we separated DHA-untreated cells from CMTs cells to be a control group, the rest of the CMTs cells treated by DHA which were composed of three concentrations 5,10 as well as 20 μM. After that we cultivate the cells severally under the condition of 24, 48 and 72 h at 37 °C. CMTs cells were evaluated by Cell viability assay, Wound healing assay, Invasion assay and RT-PCR analysis for the expression of Slug, ZEB1, ZEB2 and Twist. Our results showed that DHA increased the inhibitory rate of CMTs cell and restrain TGF-β1-induced migration and invasion of cells in a time and concentration reliant manner efficaciously. Our result also show DHA inhibits the expression of Slug, ZEB1, ZEB2 and Twist at the mRNA in vitro, the media concentration DHA (10 μM) decreased the expression level of the Slug, ZEB1, ZEB2 mRNA significantly.

The catalytic mechanism of these LPMOs remains somewhat enigmatic. Recently, novel insights have been obtained from studies of enzyme-substrate complexes by X-ray crystallography, EPR, NMR, and modeling. Furthermore, it has been shown that LPMOs may carry out peroxygenase reactions, at much higher rates than monooxygenase reactions, which affects our understanding and exploitation of these powerful enzymes."

However, sewers still transport similar quantities of solids and pollutants, leading to increased wastewater concentration and, potentially, excess solids deposition. The shift towards decentralised water schemes in cities and widely reported changes in rainfall patterns cast additional uncertainty on future wastewater quality and flows into sewers. Excess solids deposition in sewers can cause increased environmental pollution risks at Combined Sewer Overflows from solids resuspension and reduced sewer hydraulic capacities. This review analyses the magnitude of excess solids deposition due to changing wastewater composition and evaluates current approaches to modelling sewer solids. Gaps in commonly used modelling approaches for deposited bed processes, specifically in bed consolidation and bed particle cohesion processes, and gross solids transport were identified and addressed to enable better solids risk prediction and management.",Renoprotective phenolic meroterpenoids from the mushroom Ganoderma cochlear.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30947089,Phytochemistry,2019 05 16,"Twelve previously undescribed phenolic meroterpenoids, cochlearols N-Y, along with two known analogs, ganocochlearins B and C, were isolated from the fruiting bodies of Ganoderma cochlear.

Previous work from our lab has demonstrated acidic-organelle Ca2+ release as a participant in agonist-evoked signaling dynamics of the parotid acinar cell. Furthermore, results implicated a potential role for the potent Ca2+ releasing second messenger NAADP in these events. The current study interrogated a direct role of NAADP for Ca2+ signaling in the parotid salivary gland acinar cell. Use of live-cell Ca2+ imaging, patch-clamp methods, and confocal microscopy revealed for the first time NAADP can evoke or enhance Ca2+ dynamics in parotid acini. These results were compared with pancreatic acini, a morphologically similar cell type previously shown to display NAADP-dependent Ca2+ signals.

However, the fundamental role of the SWCNT electrical types in the PSCs is not well understood. Herein, we prepared semiconducting (s-) and metallic (m-) SWCNT families and integrated them into TiO2 photoelectrodes of the PSCs. Based on experimental and theoretical studies, we found that the electrical type of the nanotubes plays an important role in the devices. In particular, the mixture of s-SWCNTs and m-SWCNTs (2:1 w/w)-based PSCs exhibited a remarkable efficiency of up to 19.35%, which was significantly higher than that of the best control cell (17.04%). In this class of PSCs, semiconducting properties of s-SWCNTs play a critical role in extracting and transporting electrons, whereas m-SWCNTs provide high conductance throughout the electrode.",A unified (but in fact not fully testable) model of preeclampsia triggering.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30947086,Journal of reproductive immunology,2019 04 09,"In this summary of my presentation in the last Reunion workshop I discuss a few assertions on preeclampsia, then turn on a (not fully testable) model where an embryonic defect in expression of embryo/ placental regulatory proteins results in complement activation, itself responsible for a down regulation of the T regs activity, resulting in a very early lack of complete down regulation of the preimplantation decidual inflammation, causing in the post implantation stage a low grade but chronic inflammatory state.",Toxicological exploration of peptide-based cationic liposomes in siRNA delivery.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30947085,"Colloids and surfaces. B, Biointerfaces",2019 05 31,"The toxicology of cationic liposomes was explored to advance clinical trials of liposome-mediated gene therapy through the analysis of a peptide cationic liposome with DOTAP as a positive control. We first investigated the delivery of luciferase siRNA by several peptide liposomes in mice bearing lung cancer A549 cell xenografts. Of these, a cationic liposome (CDO14) was selected for further investigation. CDO14 efficiently mediated IGF-1R-siRNA delivery and inhibited the growth of the A549 cell xenografts. The in vivo toxicity and toxicological mechanisms of the selected liposome were evaluated to assess its potential utility for gene delivery. Specifically, the effects of CDO14 on mouse body weight, hematology, urine, serum biochemical indices, and histopathology were measured in acute toxicity and subchronic toxicity tests. CDO14 showed limited toxicological effects at low dosages although it induced pulmonary inflammation and liver injury at higher dosages. The toxicity of CDO14 was lower than that of DOTAP, and the toxicity of CDO14 did not change when complexed with siRNA. The pulmonary inflammation induced by CDO14 occurred via expressional up-regulation of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-6, and expressional down-regulation of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. Liver injury induced by CDO14 was mediated by the JAK2-STAT3 signaling pathway. Lastly, CDO14 did not affect the expression of apoptosis-related proteins in normal liver cells, suggesting that it did not induce apoptosis of normal cells. The toxicological results demonstrate that peptide-based headgroups in lipids are superior to those with quaternary ammonium headgroups that are used as gene vectors for cancer therapy.",pH-Activatable tumor-targeting gold nanoprobe for near-infrared fluorescence/CT dual-modal imaging in vivo.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30947084,"Colloids and surfaces. B, Biointerfaces",2019 05 31,"One hallmark of solid tumors, regardless of its type or stage, is the existence of an unsual acidic microenvironment, which has been considered a specific and ideal target for cancer imaging. Therefore, we developed a pH-activatable nanoprobe GNPs-CKL-FA for near-infrared fluorescence (NIR) and computed tomography (CT) imaging of tumors. This nanoprobe consists of a near-infrared fluorophore (Cy5.5), a pH-sensitive ketal linker, and gold nanoparticles (GNPs) decorated with folates that could bind to tumor cells' surface receptors to promote cellular internalization. This ability of folate to mediate tumor targeting and accelerate internalization has been confirmed by in vitro experiments with HeLa cells. The fluorescence of the nanoprobes successfully activated by low intracellular pH, especially in more acidic organelles. Furthermore, fluorescence signals increased to a greater extent when the pH in tumors was lowered by injection of acetate buffer and isoproterenol. The CT contrast of GNPs-CKL-FA was obtained after administering intravenously to HeLa subcutaneous tumor-bearing mice. These results suggest that GNPs-CKL-FA has the potential to be a pH-activatable fluorescent nanoprobe combined with CT contrast agent for tumor targeted imaging.",Effect of in vitro collagen fibrillogenesis on Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) deposition for cellular behavior regulation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30947083,"Colloids and surfaces.

Furthermore, the fibrillogenesis impacting on the π-a isotherms of collagen assembly at the air/water interface was then fully evaluated. By applying LB technique, collagen fibril-assembling arrays structure can be successfully transferred to form surface deposition onto the mica and glass substrate. The morphology and collagen content were subsequently assessed by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and hydrolyzing examination respectively. Effect of collagen LB deposition on the adhesion and proliferation of SD rat bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells were estimated by Rhodamine Phalloidin/DIPI staining and CCK8 proliferation assays. The results show that highly oriented and collagen-abundant thin film can further facilitate cell adhesion and proliferation, indicating an innovative direction for tissue engineering.",Does the age of seizure onset relate to menarche and does it matter?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30947081,Seizure,2019 06 10,To determine whether there is a relationship between the age of seizure onset and the age of menarche.,Simultaneous debromination and mineralization of bromophenol in an up-flow electricity-stimulated anaerobic system.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30947080,Water research,2019 05 04,"Due to highly recalcitrant and toxicological nature of halogenated organic compounds, conventional anaerobic dehalogenation is often limited by low removal rate and poor process stability. Besides, the reduction intermediates or products formed during dehalogenation process, which are still toxic, required further energy-intensive aerobic post-treatment. In this study, an up-flow electricity-stimulated anaerobic system (ESAS) was developed by installing cathode underneath and anode above to realize simultaneous anaerobic debromination and mineralization of 4-bromophenol (4-BP). When cathode potential was -600 mV, high TOC removal efficiency (98.78 ± 0.96%), complete removal of 4-BP and phenol could be achieved at 4-BP loading rate of 0.58 mol m-3 d-1, suggesting debrominated product of 4-BP from cathode (i.e., phenol) would be utilized as the fuel by the bioanode of ESAS. Under high 4-BP loading rate (2.32 mol m-3 d-1) and low electron donor dosage (4.88 mM), 4-BP could be completely removed at acetate usage ratio as low as 4.21 ± 1.42 mol acetate mol-1 4-BP removal in ESAS, whereas only 13.45 ± 1.38% of 4-BP could be removed at acetate usage ratio as high as 31.28 ± 3.38 mol acetate mol-1 4-BP removal in control reactor. Besides, electrical stimulation distinctly facilitated the growth of various autotrophic dehalogenation species, phenol degradation related species, fermentative species, homoacetogens and electrochemically active species in ESAS. Moreover, based on the identified intermediates and the bacterial taxonomic analysis, possible metabolism mechanism involved in enhanced anaerobic debromination and mineralization of 4-BP in ESAS was proposed."

When analyzing the complexity of cellular dynamics and variability, it is important to construct a pseudo-time trajectory using single-cell expression data to reflect the process of cellular development. Although a number of computational and statistical methods have been developed recently for single-cell analysis, more effective and efficient methods are still strongly needed. In this work we propose a new method named SCOUT for the inference of single-cell pseudo-time ordering with bifurcation trajectories. We first propose to use the fixed-radius near neighbors algorithms based on cell densities to find landmarks to represent the cell states, and employ the minimum spanning tree (MST) to determine the developmental branches. We then propose to use the projection of Apollonian circle or a weighted distance to determine the pseudo-time trajectories of single cells. The proposed algorithm is applied to one synthetic and two realistic single-cell datasets (including single-branching and multi-branching trajectories) and the cellular developmental dynamics is recovered successfully. Compared with other popular methods, numerical results show that our proposed method is able to generate more robust and accurate pseudo-time trajectories.

In silico computer Aided Drug Design approaches were used and ninety two diverse pharmacophore models were generated from eighteen Glyoxalase I crystallographic complexes. Subsequent QSAR modeling followed by ROC evaluation identified a single pharmacophore model which was able to predict the expected Glyoxalase I inhibition. Screening of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) database using the optimal pharmacophore Hypo(3VW9) identified several promising hits. Thirty eight hits were successfully predicted then ordered and evaluated in vitro.

As such, cysteine and its derivatives are always essential signal molecules and thus have important roles in the regulation of many plant processes. O-acetylserine (thiol) lyase (OASTL) catalyzes the last step of the biosynthesis of cysteine. At present, detailed and comprehensive work about these enzymes has only been reported from the plant Arabidopsis thaliana, though sporadic studies on OASTL have been conducted on other dicots, such as spinach and soybean. However, few reports on the functions of OASTLs in monocots have been found in the literature. Here in this study, we obtained four SiOASTL genes (SiOASTL7, SiOASTL8, SiOASTL9 and SiOASTL10) from foxtail millet and analyzed their potential functions. Phylogenetically, the four SiOASTL genes did not belong to any published subfamily of the OASTL genes; instead they constituted a new subfamily specific to the OASTL genes from monocots. In sequencing, we found that with the exception of the pseudogene SiOASTL8, proteins encoded by the other three genes exhibited high similarity with OASTL proteins from Arabidopsis, though the critical PLP-binding sites of both SiOASTL7 and SiOASTL10 were missing. The enzymatic activity assays demonstrated that SiOASTL9 has the ability to catalyze the biosynthesis of both cysteine and S-sulfocysteine, while SiOASTL7 and SiOASTL10 did not possess any previously reported catalyzing abilities. In addition, the gene expression pattern analysis showed that all four genes were widely expressed in various tissues of foxtail millet, and all had a preference in the leaves. Under abiotic stresses, the expression of these genes could be induced by salt and drought stress. Our finding that cadmium could only up-regulate the transcription of SlOASTL8 and SlOASTL9, further indicates the diversified responses of SiOASTLs to abiotic stresses.",A scoping review of sexual minority women's health in Latin America and the Caribbean.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30947062,International journal of nursing studies,2019 06 16,"Despite research documenting significant health disparities among sexual minority women (lesbian, bisexual, and other non-heterosexual women) in high-income countries, few studies of sexual minority women's health have been conducted in low- and middle-income countries.

The results showed that soil and microbes both developed a lot after reclamation. Mean concentration of soil organic matter (SOM) and total phosphorus (TP) were higher than background value of chestnut soil, while total nitrogen (TN) and total potassium (TK) were lower than that. Soil nutrients and microorganisms in research areas were strongly correlated with each other.

The ranking of VOC mixing ratios was methanol (32.72 ± 8.94 ppb) > acetaldehyde (5.05 ± 2.4 ppb) > acetic acid (3.42 ± 1.71 ppb). Lanzhou has higher oxygenated VOCs (OVOCs) mixing ratios (methanol and acetaldehyde) and lower aromatics levels (benzene, toluene and C8-aromatics) compared with other cities. The positive matrix factorization (PMF) model showed eight sources of VOCs as follows: (1) mixed industrial process-1 (13.5%), (2) secondary formation (13.2%), (3) mixed industrial process-2 (11.8%), (4) residential biofuel use and waste disposal (13.80%), (5) solvent usage (10.1%), (6) vehicular exhaust (11.8%), (7) biogenic (13.8%) and (8) biomass burning (12.0%). Both the PSCF and the CWT results of mixed industrial process-1 were mainly from the northeast of Lanzhou and the biomass burning was from the southeast; the other four sources (without secondary formation and biogenic) were mainly from the west and northwest of Lanzhou, which were associated with the dust area of the Gobi Desert. A trajectory sector analysis revealed that the local emissions contributed 64.9-71.1% to the VOCs. OVOCs accounted for 43% of the ozone production potential (OFP), and residential biofuel use and waste disposal (25.1%), mixed industrial process-2 (15.3%) and solvent usage (13.4%) appeared to be the dominant sources contributors to O3 production.

In this study, acute toxicity of methylparaben (MeP), ethylparaben (EtP), and propylparaben (PrP) was assessed in the marine copepod Tigriopus japonicus. The acute toxicity assessment resulted in the median lethal concentration (LC50) values of MeP, EtP, and PrP were 29,754, 11,659, and 113 μg/L, respectively, for male and 38,183, 15,371, and 357 μg/L, respectively, for female, indicating the strongest toxicity of PrP, compared to MeP and EtP and the higher sensitivity of males compared to females. Developmental retardation and reproduction rate were also measured under chronic exposure. Furthermore, significant alteration in sex ratio was shown in PrP-exposed group, indicating PrP would have feminization effect in T. japonicus.

Therefore, studies on health risk assessment of exposure to metals for urban population is necessary and urgent, especially for children, who are more susceptible to environmental pollution due to their undeveloped immune system. Moreover, ingestion has been proved to be the most important pathway of human metals exposure. Therefore, typical metals, including Lead(Pb), Cadmium(Cd), Arsenic(As), Chromium(Cr), and Manganese(Mn), were analyzed in duplicated diet, drinking water, and soil in this study. The integrated risks of oral exposure to these metals for the local children were then evaluated on a field sampling and measured child-specific exposure factors basis. Results showed that the studied urban environments were polluted by metals to a certain degree. Food ingestion was the largest, which accounted for 66.7%-98.4%. Furthermore, soil ingestion was also a non-negligible exposure route, which accounted for 29.7% for Pb. The combined oral non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic risks all exceeding the corresponding maximum acceptable levels. The non-carcinogenic risk was mainly attributed to the food ingestion of As and Cr, and the soil ingestion of As, while, the carcinogenic risk was mainly attributed to the food ingestion of As and Cr, and the soil ingestion of Cr. This study emphasizes attentions should be paid to children in urban areas due to the potential adverse health risk associated with metals via oral exposure pathway.",Graphene and graphene-based nanocomposites used for antibiotics removal in water treatment: A review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30947046,Chemosphere,2019 05 07,"Due to their extensive application in human and veterinary medicine, antibiotics have been found worldwide and studied as new pollutants in the aquatic environment. In order to remove such pollutants, adsorption and photocatalysis have attracted tremendous attention because of their great potential in antibiotics removal from aqueous solutions. Graphene, as a novel two-dimensional nanomaterial, possesses unique structure and physicochemical properties, which can be used to efficiently adsorb and photodegrade antibiotics. This review provides an overview of the adsorptive and catalytic properties of graphene, and recent advances in adsorption and photodegradation of antibiotics by graphene and its derivatives. The factors that affect the adsorption and photodegradation of antibiotics are reviewed and discussed. Furthermore, the underlying mechanisms of adsorption and photodegradation are summarized and analyzed. Meanwhile, statistical analysis is conducted based on the number of papers and the maximum adsorption and photodegradation ability on various antibiotics removal. Finally, some unsolved problems together with major challenges that exist in the fabrication and application of graphene-based nanocomposites and the development for antibiotics removal is also proposed. This work provides theoretical guidance for subsequent research in the field of adsorption and photocatalytic removal of antibiotics from aqueous solution, especially on influence factors and mechanisms aspects.",Lactational exposure to phthalates impaired the neurodevelopmental function of infants at 9 months in a pilot prospective study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30947045,Chemosphere,2019 05 07,"Phthalates are widespread endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) that have been suggested to affect neurodevelopment. However, association between lactational exposure to phthalates and neurodevelopmental effects has rarely been reported in epidemiological studies. We conducted a pilot prospective study of 138 mother-infant pairs to evaluate whether lactational exposure to phthalates was associated with neurodevelopmental effects in infants. At baseline survey, the spot urine samples from both mothers and infants were collected for measuring ten metabolites of phthalates, and the food intake information of infants was assessed by the food-frequency questionnaire (FFQ). At the follow-up survey in 9 months of age, the neurodevelopmental Function of infants was assessed using the Ages and Stages Questionnaire Edition 3 (ASQ-3). Multivariate logistic regression models were used to calculate the odds ratio (OR) for delayed development according to the level of exposure to phthalates. Our results indicated that MnBP and MiBP were high in lactating infants and mothers. In the overall study population, most metabolites showed positive associations with delayed development of most ASQ-3 domains. In male, MMP, MEP, MiBP and MnBP but not DEHP metabolites were significantly associated with increased odds of delayed development of all domains. In female, most LMWP metabolites and the four oxidative metabolites of DEHP were significantly associated with increased odds of delayed development of most domains. In conclusion, we found a significant negative association between lactational exposure to phthalates and ASQ-3 domains. Some of the sex-specific observations warrant further investigation. The dietary source of lactational phthalates exposure may not the breast milk or infant formula but the complementary food.",Interactive effect of crude glycerin concentration and C:N ratio on polyhydroxyalkanoates accumulation by mixed microbial cultures modelled with Response Surface Methodology.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30947043,Water research,2019 04 15,"Response Surface Methodology (RSM) was used to investigate how the crude glycerin concentration and the carbon to nitrogen (C:N) ratio in the culture medium affect four indicators of polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) accumulation by mixed microbial cultures (MMC): the observed coefficient of active-biomass yield (Yobs,BA), the observed coefficient of PHA yield (Yobs,PHA), the PHA content in biomass (XPHA) and the volumetric productivity (PrV). The C:N ratio had the largest effect on Yobs,BA and Yobs,PHA. When the C:N ratio was increased, Yobs,BA decreased and Yobs,PHA increased, regardless of the concentration of crude glycerin in the culture medium. The C:N ratio also had the largest effect on the PHA content, whereas volumetric productivity was strongly affected by both the C:N ratio and the crude glycerin concentration. The optimal conditions for PHA accumulation were a crude glycerin concentration of 8954 mg COD/L with a C:N ratio of 15.9 mg C/mg N-NH4, which gave a Yobs,BA of 0.29 mg CODBA/mg COD, a Yobs,PHA of 0.28 mg CODPHA/mg COD, a XPHA of 55.6% VSS and a PrV of 757.3 mg CODPHA/L⋅d (550.0 mg PHA/L⋅d). The accumulated PHAs consisted mainly of 3-hydroxybutyrate. By using RSM, it was possible to predict crude glycerin concentrations and C:N ratios not tested here that will allow desirable values of PHA content in biomass or PHA productivity, which can be useful for designing PHA production with MMC.",2D kaolin ultrafiltration membrane with ultrahigh flux for water purification.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30947042,Water research,2019 04 15,"Membrane separation technology is an important option for the treatment of contaminated surface waters but the relatively high cost of materials and membrane fabrication represent a significant obstacle to the wider use of membrane processes. In this study, we describe the development and testing of a new kind of membrane made from two-dimensional (2D) kaolin nanosheets. The fabrication involved a layer-by-layer stacking of the nanosheets with a cationic polyacrylamide cross-linking agent, assembled on a cellulose acetate supporting layer. The kaolin membrane exhibited an ultrahigh flux (∼4000 L.m-2.h-1.bar-1) which was almost ten times greater than that of a commercial polyether sulfone (PES) ultrafiltration (UF) membrane. The membrane was tested using a range of influent water types, including samples of a lake water, river water and three natural organic matter solutions. The results showed that the kaolin membrane was stable and behaved as an UF membrane, in terms of its pore size distribution (peak distribution at 20-35 nm) and comparable treatment performance to the PES UF membrane. The kaolin membrane showed a substantially reduced rate of fouling, compared to PES membrane, despite a much greater flux, which was partly attributed to its highly hydrophilic nature. The advantages of lower cost, much higher flux and lower fouling propensity make the 2D-kaolin membrane a potentially important development in UF membrane technology for drinking water treatment, and possibly other applications.",Learning and memory deficits and alzheimer's disease-like changes in mice after chronic exposure to microcystin-LR.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30947040,Journal of hazardous materials,2019 06 03,"Previous studies have demonstrated that toxins produced by toxic cyanobacterial blooms are hazardous materials. Although microcystin-LR (MC-LR) has been revealed to inflict damage to the brain, the mechanisms underlying its neurotoxicity as a result of chronic exposure to MC-LR are not fully described. In this study, the mice were exposed to MC-LR dissolved in drinking water at doses of 1, 7.5, 15, or 30 μg/L for 180 days. MC-LR accumulated mostly in the mouse hippocampus (55 ng/g dry weight) followed by cortex (28 ng/g dry weight) after exposure to MC-LR at 30 μg/L. MC-LR exposure at this concentration induced dysfunction of learning and memory, accompanied with apoptosis of neuronal cells (with 10% reduction of the neurons in the CA1 region and 15% in the CA2 region), reduction of spine density, accumulation of β-amyloid plaques 1-42 (Aβ1-42), and enhanced phosphorylation of tau (p-tau) in the brain, which is characteristic of Alzheimer's disease (AD). These data indicate that MC-LR may induce AD-like pathology. Following prolonged exposure, MC-LR significantly upregulated the ratio of proBDNF to BDNF by downregulating the tPA levels, thereby activating downstream signaling pathways to improve the expression of p-JNK, and c-Jun while to inhibit the expression of p-Creb and p-PKC. This study uncovered new molecular mechanisms that account for neurotoxicity after chronic exposure to MC-LR, which has wide-ranging implications for public health.",Enhanced dye removal using polymeric nanocomposite through incorporation of Ag doped ZnO nanoparticles: Synthesis and characterization.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30947039,Journal of hazardous materials,2019 06 03,"A facile method was approached to synthesize a new series of highly porous polyethylene glycol (PEG) and Ag-ZnO (AZO) grafted polyaniline (PANI) nanocomposites (PAPE/AZO) for investigation of the adsorption behavior of brilliant green dye (BG). The compositions of Ag (1, 3 and 5%) in AZO were varied to assess the influence of bimetallic oxide incorporation. The nanocomposites were characterized by FTIR, XRD, SEM and TEM analyses. The adsorption performance of the PAPE/AZO was assessed by various parametric changes viz. contact time, pH, temperature, concentration of the dye and adsorbent dosage. The highest adsorption capacity of 94.46 mg g-1 was achieved at the optimum conditions of 0.075 g adsorbent dosage, 70 mg L-1 dye concentration, 1% AZO and pH 2. BET and BJH analyses of the nanocomposite confirmed the higher surface area and pore volume with lower amount of AZO that supported PAPE for enhanced dye removal. The Langmuir isotherm model fits the equilibrium conditions indicating a homogeneous distribution of active sites on the surface of the nanocomposite. Adsorption kinetic model ensued pseudo second order exhibiting chemisorption process. From the results, it is obvious that PAPE/AZO can be used as a potential core substance for treating real-time industrial dye effluents.",An eco-designed paper-based algal biosensor for nanoformulated herbicide optical detection.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30947038,Journal of hazardous materials,2019 06 03,"In this study we reported the development of a paper-based algal biosensor for the optical detection of nanoencapsulated-atrazine, a forefront nanoformulated herbicide with a high effective post-emergence herbicidal activity. In particular, the unicellular green photosynthetic algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii was immobilised on a paper substrate soaked with an agar thin film and placed in a glass optical measurement cell, obtaining a totally environmental-friendly device. Nanoencapsulated-atrazine was detected by following the variable fluorescence (1-VJ) parameter, which decreased inversely proportional to the herbicide concentrations, in a range between 0.5 and 200 nM, indicating a linear relationship in the measured dose-response curves and a detection limit of 4 pM. Interference studies resulted in a very slight interference in presence of 2 ppm copper and 10 ppb arsenic at safety limits, as well as a slight matrix effect and a satisfactory recovery value of 96 ± 5% for 75 nM nanoencapsulated-atrazine in tap water. Stability studies were also performed obtaining a good storage stability up to 3 weeks.

Preequilibrated kaolinite colloids with heavy metal solution was injected to the column until 10 pore volumes under two different flow rates and three different concentration of kaolinite colloids. Heavy metal concentration in effluent showed that the mobility of Pb was facilitated as kaolinite colloids concentration (Cc0) increases under high flow rate while the mobility of Pb and Cu were retarded as Cc0 increases under low flow rate. In addition, optimized first order rate coefficient related to sand-heavy metal interaction and estimated bed efficiency of experimental breakthrough curves demonstrated that the presence of mobile kaolinite colloids delayed the adsorption of heavy metals to the sand and facilitated the transport. Colloid associated contaminant transport model used in this study was found to be well fitted to the experimental breakthrough curves with the parameters associated with observed heavy metal transport without kaolinite colloids and adsorption/desorption between the heavy metals and the mobile kaolinite colloids."

FACT facilitates transcriptional elongation by destabilising nucleosomes in the path of RNAPII, assisting efficient transcription of chromatin templates. In contrast to wild type seeds, freshly harvested seeds of the Arabidopsis ssrp1 mutant germinate efficiently, exhibiting reduced seed dormancy. In line with this phenotype, the ssrp1 seeds have decreased transcript levels of the DOG1 gene, which is a known quantitative trait locus (QTL) for seed dormancy. Analysis of ssrp1 plants harbouring an additional copy of DOG1 show increased levels of DOG1 transcript and consistently more robust seed dormancy. Therefore, our findings indicate that SSRP1 is a novel factor required for the efficient expression of DOG1 and hence a modulator of seed dormancy in Arabidopsis.",Predictors of differential response to induction therapy in high-risk neuroblastoma: A report from the Children's Oncology Group (COG).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30947024,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",2019 05 01,Induction chemotherapy plays an important role in the management of patients with high-risk neuroblastoma.

Production of the oxidized guanine base, 8-oxo-guanine (8-oxoG), results in mismatched pairing with adenine and subsequently leads to G:C to T:A transversions after DNA replication. Our previous study demonstrated that Drosophila CG1795 encodes an ortholog of Ogg1, which is essential for the elimination of 8-oxoG. Moreover, the Drosophila ribosomal protein S3 (RpS3) possesses N-glycosylase activity that eliminates 8-oxoG in vitro. In this study, we show that RpS3 heterozygotes hyper-accumulate 8-oxoG in midgut cell nuclei after oxidant feeding, suggesting thatRpS3 is required for the elimination of 8-oxoG in Drosophila adults. We further showed that several muscle-aging phenotypes were significantly accelerated in RpS3 heterozygotes. Ogg1 is localized in the nucleus, while RpS3 is in the cytoplasm, closely associated with endoplasmic reticulum networks. Results of genetic analyses also suggest that these two proteins operate similarly but independently in the elimination of oxidized guanine bases from genomic DNA. Next, we obtained genetic evidence suggesting that CG42813 functions as the Drosophila ortholog of mammalian Mth1 in the elimination of oxidized dGTP (8-oxo-dGTP) from the nucleotide pool. Depletion of this gene significantly increased the number of DNA damage foci in the nuclei of Drosophila midgut cells. Furthermore, several aging-related phenotypes such as age-dependent loss of adult locomotor activities and accumulation of polyubiquitylated proteins in adult muscles were also significantly accelerated in CG42813-depleted flies. Lastly, we investigated the phenotype of adults depleted of CG9272, which encodes a protein with homology to mammalian Nth1 that is essential for the elimination of oxidized thymine. Excessive accumulation of oxidized bases was observed in the epithelial cell nuclei after oxidant feeding. In conclusion, three genes that prevent accumulation of oxidative DNA damage were identified in Drosophila.",Two Arabidopsis Receptor-like Cytoplasmic Kinases SZE1 and SZE2 Associate with the ZAR1-ZED1 Complex and Are Required for Effector-Triggered Immunity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30947022,Molecular plant,2019 04 27,"Plants utilize intracellular nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat domain-containing receptors (NLRs) to recognize pathogen effectors and induce a robust defense response named effector-triggered immunity (ETI).

We previously described a dominant mutant of Arabidopsis ZED1, zed1-D, which displays temperature-sensitive autoimmunity in a ZAR1-dependent manner. Here, we report that the RLCKs SUPPRESSOR OF ZED1-D1 (SZE1) and SZE2 associate with the ZAR1-ZED1 complex and are required for the ZED1-D-activated autoimmune response and HopZ1a-triggered immunity. We show that SZE1 but not SZE2 has autophosphorylation activity, and that the N-terminal myristoylation of both SZE1 and SZE2 is critical for their plasma membrane localization and ZED1-D-activated autoimmunity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that SZE1 and SZE2 both interact with ZAR1 to form a functional complex and are required for resistance against P. syringae pv. tomato DC3000 expressing HopZ1a. We also provide evidence that SZE1 and SZE2 interact with HopZ1a and function together with ZED1 to change the intramolecular interactions of ZAR1, leading to its activation.

HMPV F from some, but not all, viral strains promotes fusion only after exposure to low pH. Previous studies have identified several key residues involved in low pH triggering, including H435 and a proposed requirement for glycine at position 294. We analyzed the different levels of fusion activity, protein expression and cleavage of three HMPV F proteins not previously examined. Interestingly, low pH-triggered fusion in the absence of G294 was identified in one F protein, while a novel histidine residue (H434) was identified that enhanced low pH promoted fusion in another. The third F protein failed to promote cell-to-cell fusion, suggesting other requirements for F protein triggering. Our results demonstrate HMPV F triggering is more complex than previously described and suggest a more intricate mechanism for fusion protein function and activation.",Exposure to a nanosilver-enabled consumer product results in similar accumulation and toxicity of silver nanoparticles in the marine mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30946994,"Aquatic toxicology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",2019 05 10,"The incorporation of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) in commercial products is increasing rapidly. The consequent release of AgNPs into domestic and industrial wastewater raises environmental concerns due to their anti-microbial properties and toxicity to non-target aquatic organisms. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of nanArgen™ (Nanotek S.A.), a AgNP-enabled consumer product, in the marine bivalve Mytilus galloprovincialis. Two environmentally relevant concentrations of nanArgen™ (1 and 10 μg/L) were tested in vivo for 96 h, and Ag was quantified in mussel soft tissue and natural seawater (NSW). nanArgen™ suspensions were characterized via TEM, SEM, EDS, DLS, and UV-vis optical analysis. Several molecular and biochemical responses were investigated in exposed mussels: lysosomal membrane stability by Neutral Red Retention Time (NRRT) assay; micronucleus (MN) frequency in hemocytes; metallothionein (MT) protein content and gene expression (mt10 and mt20); catalase (CAT) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activities; malondialdehyde (MDA) accumulation in digestive glands; and efflux activity of ATP-binding cassette transport proteins (ABC) in gill biopsies. SEM, TEM and DLS analyses confirmed the presence of well-defined AgNPs in nanArgen™ which were roughly spherical with an average particle size of approx. 30 ± 10 nm. DLS analysis revealed the formation of AgNP aggregates in nanArgen™ suspension in NSW (Z-average of 547.80 ± 90.23 nm; PDI of 0.044). A significant concentration-dependent accumulation of Ag was found in mussels' whole soft tissue in agreement with a concentration-dependent decrease in NRRT and an increase of MN frequency in hemocytes and GST activities in digestive glands. A significant increase in MDA levels and MT via both molecular and biochemical tests, were also observed but only at the highest nanArgen™ concentration (10 μg/L). No changes were observed in CAT activities. ABC efflux activities in gill biopsies showed a significant decrease (p <  0.05) only at the lowest concentration (1 μg/L). On such basis, nanArgen™ is shown to be able to induce toxicity and Ag accumulation in marine mussels similarly to AgNPs and in short-term exposure conditions at environmentally relevant concentrations. AgNP-enabled products, instead of pristine AgNPs, should be the focus of future ecotoxicity studies in order to address any risks associated to their widespread use, disposal and uncontrolled release into the aquatic environment for non target species."

Japan is one Asian country where the mental health care system has improved substantially in the recent decades. Yet, Japan continues to report greater under-utilization of mental health services than other developed countries. One primary reason for this is hypothesized to be the cultural climate, which includes the stock of social, cultural and medical knowledge surrounding mental illness. Previous studies have not examined the cultural toolkit (Swidler, 2001) of the Japanese public, nor have they linked these to public attributions or assessments surrounding mental health. The Stigma in Global Context - Mental Health Study (SGC-MHS), a multi-stage probability sample of Japanese residents aged 18-64 years (N = 994) in 2006 provides data to describe the unprompted care suggestions from the general population regarding case scenarios meeting psychiatric criteria for schizophrenia and depression. Guided theoretically by the Network Episode Model, we analyze if and how respondents socially organize solutions into patterns of culturally acceptable care for mental health problems in Japan. Six cultural utilization patterns appear to be shaped by beliefs about underlying attributions, perceived severity of conditions, and type of mental health problem. Further, women, older individuals and those with differing education levels suggest different care patterns than their counterparts. In sum, the findings indicate unique patterns of mental health care recommendations among the Japanese public, which are culturally and socially constrained.",Accelerated drug discovery by rapid candidate drug identification.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30946980,Drug discovery today,2019 06 16,"The eventual candidate drug (CD) is often already synthesized during early drug discovery but not nominated until much later.

In addition to driving the compound property optimization, the preclinical project team has to understand the ultimate goal to be able to rapidly identify and progress a potential CD. A screening cascade with meaningful and well-balanced progression criteria based on the CDTP is required to rapidly filter out unwanted compounds and to progress a potential CD through the cascade to candidate selection.",Molecular and functional regionalization of bicarbonate secretion cascade in the intestine of the European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30946979,"Comparative biochemistry and physiology. Part A, Molecular & integrative physiology",2019 05 11,"In marine fish the intestinal HCO3- secretion is the key mechanism to enable luminal aggregate formation and water absorption. Using the sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax), the present study aimed at establishing the functional and molecular organization of different sections of the intestine concerning bicarbonate secretion and Cl- movements. The proximal intestinal regions presented similar HCO3- secretion rates, while differences were detected in the molecular expression of the transporters involved and on regional HCO3- concentrations. The anterior region presented significantly higher Na+/K+-ATPase activity, Cl- transepithelial transport and basolateral slc4a4, apical slc26a6 and slc26a3 expression levels. In the mid intestine, the total HCO3- content was significantly increased in the fluid as in the carbonate aggregates. In the rectum no HCO3- secretion was observed and was characterized by the diminished HCO3- total content, residual molecular expression of slc4a4, slc26a6 and slc26a3, higher H+-ATPase activity and expression, suggesting the existence of a different bicarbonate handling mechanism. The possible regulation of HCO3- secretion by extracellular HCO3- and increased intracellular cAMP levels were also investigated. cAMP did not affect HCO3- secretion, although Cl- secretion was enhanced by cftr. HCO3- secretion rise due to the HCO3- basolateral increment showed that at resting levels slc4a4 was not a limiting step for secretion. The transcellular/intracellular dependence of apical HCO3- secretion differed between the proximal regions. In conclusion, intestinal HCO3- secretion has a functional region-dependent organization that was not reflected by the anterior-posterior regionalization on HCO3- secretion and expression profiles of chloride/water absorption related genes.",Endothermy in the smalleye opah (Lampris incognitus): A potential role for the uncoupling protein sarcolipin.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30946978,"Comparative biochemistry and physiology. Part A, Molecular & integrative physiology",2019 05 11,"Sarcolipin (SLN) is a small transmembrane protein that in mice has been shown to uncouple the calcium ATPase pump of the sarcoplasmic reticulum, resulting in heat production. Mice up-regulate expression of SLN in response to cold challenge. This thermoregulatory mechanism is characterized as non-shivering muscle-based thermogenesis (NST). The current study was conducted to determine if the endothermic fish species, the smalleye opah (Lampris incognitus), has higher levels of sln transcription in tissues thought to be the main source of endothermic heat, namely the red aerobic pectoral fin musculature, which powers continuous swimming in this species. A search of the draft assembly of the opah genome reveals a single sln gene that is 95% identical to the zebrafish sln ortholog at the amino acid level. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) using opah-specific sln shows significantly higher sln transcript levels in the dark red pectoral fin muscle compared to both the light red pectoral muscle and white axial muscle tissues. The high ratio of sln transcripts to CaATPase (serca1) transcripts suggests that opah may utilize a futile calcium cycling NST mechanism in the dark red pectoral fin muscle to generate heat.",Pulsed electric field operates enzymatically by causing early activation of calpains in beef during ageing.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30946977,Meat science,2019 04 12,"A study was conducted to elucidate the impact of pulsed electric field (PEF) on the activity of calpains, proteolytic activity of desmin and troponin-T and physicochemical properties of beef Biceps femoris during ageing.

In this study, we analyzed age-dependent synaptic modifications in developing neuromuscular synapses of rats with prenatal hyperhomocysteinemia (hHCY). One of the main findings indicate that the intensity and the timing of transmitter release in synapses of neonatal (P6 and P10) hHCY rats acquired features of matured synaptic transmission of adult rats. The amplitude and frequency of miniature end-plate currents (MEPCs) and evoked transmitter release were higher in neonatal hHCY animals compared to the control group. Analysis of the kinetics of neurotransmitter release demonstrated more synchronized release in neonatal rats with hHCY. At the same time lower release probability was observed in adults with hHCY. Spontaneous transmitter release in neonates with hHCY was inhibited by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) whereas in controls this oxidant was effective only in adult animals indicating a higher susceptibility of motor nerve terminals to oxidative stress. The morphology and the intensity of endocytosis of synaptic vesicles in motor nerve endings was assessed using the fluorescence dye FM 1-43. Adult-like synapses were found in neonates with hHCY which were characterized by a larger area of presynaptic terminals compared to controls. No difference in the intensity of FM 1-43 fluorescence was observed between two groups of animals. Prenatal hHCY resulted in reduced muscle strength assessed by the Paw Grip Endurance test. Using biochemical assays we found an increased level of H2O2 and lipid peroxidation products in the diaphragm muscles of hHCY rats. This was associated with a lowered activity of superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase. Our data indicate that prenatal hHCY induces oxidative stress and apparent faster functional and morphological ""maturation"" of motor synapses. Our results uncover synaptic mechanisms of disrupted muscle function observed in hHCY conditions which may contribute to the pathogenesis of motor neuronal diseases associated with enhanced level of homocysteine.",Prognostic Implications for Adolescents With Depression Who Drop Out of Psychological Treatment During a Randomized Controlled Trial.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30946974,Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry,2019 06 14,"High therapy dropout rates among adolescents have been reported, but little is known about whether dropout is associated with poor outcomes.

Cesium-137 concentrations in rivers result from complex transfer processes, depending on multiple forcings. Better knowledge of the factors controlling these concentrations is therefore a prerequisite to improve predictions of 137Cs transfers within river catchments. This study aimed at analyzing the spatial and temporal variability of 137Cs concentrations in rivers and identifying the key factors controlling their variability. Published values of 137Cs concentrations in rivers in the north of FDNPP were collected, characterizing 122 sampling sites from May 2011 to October 2014. It resulted in three datasets: dissolved concentrations CW (Bq/L), concentrations in suspended sediment CSS (Bq/kg) and total concentrations CT (Bq/L). The resulting database reflected a large variety of catchments and hydrological conditions. Observed 137Cs concentrations varied by 2-4 orders of magnitude and were poorly explained (R2 = 0.13-0.38) by the average contamination density. Indices summarizing the complex spatial and temporal properties of the catchments were proposed as candidate explanatory variables of concentrations in rivers. They were selected by stepwise regression for each dataset (CW, CSS, CT). For the three datasets, the selection and combination of 5-10 indices significantly better explained this variability (R2 = 0.69-0.83). Deposit indices were identified as first drivers of concentrations in rivers. A deposit index was selected for each dataset, indicating no effect of the contamination distribution for CW, whereas CT and CSS required considering the distribution of contamination and connectivity, as well as the presence of dams for CSS. The others selected variables significantly contributed to explain the concentration variability. This meta-analysis emphasizes the importance of structural (e.g. slope, land-cover) and functional (e.g. delay, season, rainfall) properties in the dissimilarities of catchments responses, stressing that assessments could be improved by including more these properties in models.",Aging and lineage allocation changes of bone marrow skeletal (stromal) stem cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30946971,Bone,2019 04 30,"Aging is associated with decreased bone mass and accumulation of bone marrow adipocytes.

They play vital roles in bacterial elimination during early immune responses. In the present study, a second invertebrate-type (i-type) lysozyme gene from razor clam Sinonovacula constricta (denoted as ScLYZ-2) was cloned by RACE and nested PCR methods. The full-length cDNA sequences of ScLYZ-2 were 1558 bp, including a 5' untranslated region (UTR) of 375 bp, an open reading frame of 426 bp, and a 3'-UTR of 757 bp with polyadenylation signal sequence (AATAAA) located upstream of the poly(A) tail. SMART analysis showed that ScLYZ-2 contains a signal peptide in the first 16 amino acid (AA) sequences and a destabilase domain located from 24 to 134 AA sequences. The deduced AA sequences of ScLYZ-2 were highly similar (42%-58%) to other known lysozyme genes of bivalve species. Multiple alignments of AA sequences showed that ScLYZ-2 possesses the classical i-type lysozyme family signature of two motifs [""MDVGSLSCGP(Y/F)QIK"" and ""CL(E/L/R/H)C(I/M)C""] and two catalytic residues (Glu35 and Asp46). Moreover, phylogenetic analysis showed that ScLYZ-2 is a new member of the i-type lysozyme family. In healthy razor clams, ScLYZ-2 was highly expressed in the hepatopancreas, followed by the gills, water pipes, and abdominal foot. Lysozyme activity and ScLYZ-2 expression levels were significantly upregulated in the hepatopancreas and gills after being infected with V. splendidus, V. harveyi, V. parahaemolyticus and S. aureus and M. luteus. Moreover, the recombinant ScLYZ-2 had strong antimicrobial activities against V. splendidus, V. harveyi, and V. parahaemolyticus. Furthermore, the minimal inhibitory concentration of the recombinant ScLYZ-2 against V. parahaemolyticus was 7.2 μmol/mL. Taken together, our results show that ScLYZ-2 plays an important role in the immune defense of razor clam by eliminating pathogenic microorganisms.",Pattern analysis of conditional essentiality (PACE)-based heuristic identification of an in vivo colonization determinant as a novel target for the construction of a live attenuated vaccine against Edwardsiella piscicida.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30946958,Fish & shellfish immunology,2019 05 28,"Edwardsiella piscicida is the aetiological agent of fish edwardsiellosis, causing huge economic losses in aquaculture industries. The use of a live attenuated vaccine (LAV) will be an effective strategy to control the disease in farmed fish. Thus, methods facilitating exploration of targets used for construction of an LAV will be of great significance. Previously, we devised an algorithm termed pattern analysis of conditional essentiality (PACE) to perform genome-wide analysis of the temporal dynamic behaviour of E. piscicida mutants colonizing turbot. Here, we correlated the conditional essentiality patterns of the PACE-derived colonization determinants with that of the aroC gene encoding chorismate synthase, the established target for LAV construction in E. piscicida, and identified ETAE_0023 as a novel valuable LAV target. ETAE_0023 encodes an uncharacterized DcrB family protein. Deletion of ETAE_0023 dramatically impaired E. piscicida invasion capability in ZF4 cells as well as colonization in fish and resulted in in vivo clearance at ∼30 days post-infection. ΔETAE_0023 showed an ∼2500-fold higher 50% lethal dose (LD50) than that of the wild type strain. Vaccination with ΔETAE_0023 by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection upregulated expression of immune factors, i.e., IL-1β, IgM, MHC-I and MHC-II, and produced significantly high levels of E. piscicida-specific IgM as well as serum bactericidal capacities in turbot. Moreover, a single i.p. inoculation with ΔETAE_0023 generated significant protection comparable to the established WED LAV strain in turbot against challenge with the wild type strain after 5 weeks of vaccination. Taken together, we demonstrated a PACE-based method for heuristic identification of targets for LAV construction and presented ΔETAE_0023 as a new LAV candidate against edwardsiellosis.",Rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) urea cycle and polyamine synthesis gene families show dynamic expression responses to inflammation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30946957,Fish & shellfish immunology,2019 05 07,"The urea cycle is an endogenous source of arginine that also supports removal of nitrogenous waste following protein metabolism. This cycle is considered inefficient in salmonids, where only 10-15% of nitrogenous waste is excreted as urea. In rainbow trout, arginine is an essential amino acid that has attracted attention due to its many functional roles. These roles include the regulation of protein deposition, immune responses and polyamine synthesis; the latter is directly linked to the urea cycle and involved in tissue repair. The key enzymes used in the urea cycle, namely arginase, ornithine transcarbamylase, argininosuccinate synthase and argininosuccinate lyase, in addition to two rate limiting enzymes required for polyamine synthesis (ornithine decarboxylase and s-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase) are poorly studied in fishes, and their responses to inflammation remain unknown. To address this knowledge gap, we characterised these gene families using phylogenetics and comparative genomics, investigated their mRNA distribution among a panel of tissues and established their transcriptional responses to an acute inflammatory response caused by bacterial infection in liver and muscle. Gene duplicates (paralogues) were identified for arginase (ARG1a, 1b, 2a and 2b), ornithine decarboxylase (ODC1 and 2) and s-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (SAMdc1 and 2), including paralogues retained from an ancestral salmonid-specific whole genome duplication. ARG2a and 2b were highly upregulated following bacterial infection in liver, whereas ARG1b was downregulated, while both paralogues of SAMdc and ODC were upregulated in liver and unchanged in muscle. Overall, these findings improve our understanding of the molecules supporting the urea cycle and polyamine synthesis in fish, highlighting major changes in the regulation of these systems during inflammation.",Mitochondrial ALDH2 protects against lipopolysaccharide-induced myocardial contractile dysfunction by suppression of ER stress and autophagy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30946956,Biochimica et biophysica acta. Molecular basis of disease,2019 05 06,"Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), an essential component of outer membrane of the Gram-negative bacteria, plays a pivotal role in myocardial anomalies in sepsis. Recent evidence depicted an essential role for mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH2) in cardiac homeostasis. This study examined the effect of ALDH2 on endotoxemia-induced cardiac anomalies. Echocardiographic, cardiac contractile and intracellular Ca2+ properties were examined. Our results indicated that LPS impaired cardiac contractile function (reduced fractional shortening, LV end systolic diameter, peak shortening, maximal velocity of shortening/relengthening, prolonged relengthening duration, oxidation of SERCA, and intracellular Ca2+ mishandling), associated with ER stress, inflammation, O2- production, increased autophagy, CAMKKβ, phosphorylated AMPK and suppressed phosphorylation of mTOR, the effects of which were significantly attenuated or negated by ALDH2. LPS promoted early endosomal formation (as evidenced by RAB4 and RAB5a), apoptosis and necrosis (MTT and LDH) while decreasing late endosomal formation (RAB7 and RAB 9), the effects were reversed by ALDH2. In vitro study revealed that LPS-induced SERCA oxidation, autophagy and cardiac dysfunction were abrogated by ALDH2 activator Alda-1, the ER chaperone TUDCA, the autophagy inhibitor 3-MA, or the AMPK inhibitor Compound C. The beneficial effect of Alda-1 against LPS was nullified by AMPK activator AICAR or rapamycin. CAMKKβ inhibition failed to rescue LPS-induced ER stress. Tunicamycin-induced cardiomyocyte dysfunction was ameliorated by Alda-1 and autophagy inhibition, the effect of which was abolished by rapamycin. These data suggested that ALDH2 protected against LPS-induced cardiac anomalies via suppression of ER stress, autophagy in a CAMKKβ/AMPK/mTOR-dependent manner.",The endocytic trafficking pathway of oncogenic papillomaviruses.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30946955,"Papillomavirus research (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",2019 06 03,"Over the last two decades many host cell proteins have been described to be involved in the process of infectious entry of oncogenic human papillomaviruses (HPV). After initial binding and priming of the capsid, a sequence of events on the cell surface precedes the formation of the HPV entry platform. It has been shown that the virus-associated entry complex consists of membrane organizers, tetraspanins CD151 and CD63, and their associated partner proteins such as integrins, growth factor receptors, and the annexin A2 heterotetramer. Further recruitment of cytoplasmic factors such as the obscurin-like protein 1 and actin results in a non-canonical clathrin-independent endocytosis of the virus. Internalized viruses are then routed to multivesicular bodies for capsid disassembly. This early trafficking again involves annexins, and tetraspanin proteins. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge about HPV16 endocytosis and the subsequent endosomal trafficking. Moreover, we propose a model on how tetraspanins and annexins organize the spatial accumulation of HPV16-associated molecules, the recruitment of cytoplasmic trafficking factors, and the L2 membrane penetration to trigger virus entry.",Neurobiological mechanisms of TENS-induced analgesia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30946953,NeuroImage,2019 06 15,"Pain inhibition by additional somatosensory input is the rationale for the widespread use of Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) to relieve pain. Two main types of TENS produce analgesia in animal models: high-frequency (∼50-100 Hz) and low-intensity 'conventional' TENS, and low-frequency (∼2-4 Hz) and high-intensity 'acupuncture-like' TENS. However, TENS efficacy in human participants is debated, raising the question of whether the analgesic mechanisms identified in animal models are valid in humans. Here, we used a sham-controlled experimental design to clarify the efficacy and the neurobiological effects of 'conventional' and 'acupuncture-like' TENS in 80 human volunteers. To test the analgesic effect of TENS we recorded the perceptual and brain responses elicited by radiant heat laser pulses that activate selectively Aδ and C cutaneous nociceptors. To test whether TENS has a long-lasting effect on brain state we recorded spontaneous electrocortical oscillations. The analgesic effect of 'conventional' TENS was maximal when nociceptive stimuli were delivered homotopically, to the same hand that received the TENS. In contrast, 'acupuncture-like' TENS produced a spatially-diffuse analgesic effect, coupled with long-lasting changes both in the state of the primary sensorimotor cortex (S1/M1) and in the functional connectivity between S1/M1 and the medial prefrontal cortex, a core region in the descending pain inhibitory system. These results demonstrate that 'conventional' and 'acupuncture-like' TENS have different analgesic effects, which are mediated by different neurobiological mechanisms.",False-positive neuroimaging: Undisclosed flexibility in testing spatial hypotheses allows presenting anything as a replicated finding.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30946952,NeuroImage,2019 06 15,"Hypothesis testing in neuroimaging studies relies heavily on treating named anatomical regions (e.g., ""the amygdala"") as unitary entities. Though data collection and analyses are conducted at the voxel level, inferences are often based on anatomical regions. The discrepancy between the unit of analysis and the unit of inference leads to ambiguity and flexibility in analyses that can create a false sense of reproducibility. For example, hypothesizing effects on ""amygdala activity"" does not provide a falsifiable and reproducible definition of precisely which voxels or which patterns of activation should be observed. Rather, it comprises a large number of unspecified sub-hypotheses, leaving room for flexible interpretation of findings, which we refer to as ""model degrees of freedom."" From a survey of 135 functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging studies in which researchers claimed replications of previous findings, we found that 42.2% of the studies did not report any quantitative evidence for replication such as activation peaks. Only 14.1% of the papers used exact coordinate-based or a priori pattern-based models. Of the studies that reported peak information, 42.9% of the 'replicated' findings had peak coordinates more than 15 mm away from the 'original' findings, suggesting that different brain locations were activated, even when studies claimed to replicate prior results. To reduce the flexible and qualitative region-level tests in neuroimaging studies, we recommend adopting quantitative spatial models and tests to assess the spatial reproducibility of findings. Techniques reviewed here include permutation tests on peak distance, Bayesian MANOVA, and a priori multivariate pattern-based models. These practices will help researchers to establish precise and falsifiable spatial hypotheses, promoting a cumulative science of neuroimaging.",Spatial attention underpins social word learning in the right fronto-parietal network.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30946951,NeuroImage,2019 06 15,"In a multi- and inter-cultural world, we daily encounter new words. Adult learners often rely on a situational context to learn and understand a new word's meaning. Here, we explored whether interactive learning facilitates word learning by directing the learner's attention to a correct new word referent when a situational context is non-informative. We predicted larger involvement of inferior parietal, frontal, and visual cortices involved in visuo-spatial attention during interactive learning. We scanned participants while they played a visual word learning game with and without a social partner. As hypothesized, interactive learning enhanced activity in the right Supramarginal Gyrus when the situational context provided little information. Activity in the right Inferior Frontal Gyrus during interactive learning correlated with post-scanning behavioral test scores, while these scores correlated with activity in the Fusiform Gyrus in the non-interactive group. These results indicate that attention is involved in interactive learning when the situational context is minimal and suggest that individual learning processes may be largely different from interactive ones. As such, they challenge the ecological validity of what we know about individual learning and advocate the exploration of interactive learning in naturalistic settings.",Mouse BOLD fMRI at ultrahigh field detects somatosensory networks including thalamic nuclei.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30946950,NeuroImage,2019 06 15,"Forepaw somatosensory stimulation induces neural activities in relay thalamic nuclei, the primary somatosensory cortex of forelimb (S1FL), and the secondary somatosensory cortex (S2). However, rodent fMRI studies of somatosensory stimulation have commonly reported BOLD changes only in S1FL, which may be due to side effects of anesthetics and/or the low sensitivity in the thalamus. Thus, we have obtained mouse BOLD fMRI under newly-adopted ketamine-xylazine anesthesia. High-resolution BOLD fMRI obtained with same imaging parameters at 9.4T versus 15.2T shows the improvement of functional detectability by ≥ 2 times at 15.2T due to higher signal intensity and larger BOLD response. The fMRI responses at 15.2T were robustly observed at well-known somatosensory networks including thalamus. Second, echo-time-dependent BOLD signals are dominant based on multi-echo fMRI data. A ratio of BOLD responses in S1FL to thalamus is ∼2, which is not related to different baseline T2∗ or different cerebral blood volume. Third, group-averaged 15.2T BOLD maps show activities in S1FL, S2, motor cortices, and thalamic nuclei, which agree well with neural tracing network data from the Allen Institute, demonstrating that fMRI detects entire somatosensory networks. Our data suggest that ultrahigh field fMRI provides a unique window into understanding functional networks in normal and transgenic mouse models noninvasively.",Serotonin-estrogen interactions: What can we learn from pregnancy?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30946949,Biochimie,2019 05 11,"We have reviewed the scientific literature related to four diseases in which to serotonin (5-HT) is involved in the etiology, herein named 5-HT-linked diseases, and whose prevalence is influenced by estrogenic status: depression, migraine, irritable bowel syndrome and eating disorders. These diseases all have in common a sex-dimorphic prevalence, with women more frequently affected than men. The co-occurrence between these 5-HT-linked diseases suggests that they have common physiopathological mechanisms. In most 5-HT-linked diseases (except for anorexia nervosa and irritable bowel syndrome), a decrease in the serotonergic tone is observed and estrogens are thought to contribute to the improvement of symptoms by stimulating the serotonergic system. Human pregnancy is characterized by a unique 5-HT and estrogen synthesis by the placenta. Pregnancy-specific disorders, such as hyperemesis gravidarum, gestational diabetes mellitus and pre-eclampsia, are associated with a hyperserotonergic state and decreased estrogen levels. Fetal programming of 5-HT-linked diseases is a complex phenomenon that involves notably fetal-sex differences, which suggest the implication of sex steroids. From a mechanistic point of view, we hypothesize that estrogens regulate the serotonergic system, resulting in a protective effect against 5-HT-linked diseases, but that, in turn, 5-HT affects estrogen synthesis in an attempt to retrieve homeostasis. These two processes (5-HT and estrogen biosynthesis) are crucial for successful pregnancy outcomes, and thus, a disruption of this 5-HT-estrogen relationship may explain pregnancy-specific pathologies or pregnancy complications associated with 5-HT-linked diseases."

Traditionally, MO/FOPD were thought to be of reactive, non-neoplastic nature. USP6 gene rearrangement was recently reported as a consistent finding in MO and FOPD, thus expanding the spectrum of transient, USP6-rearranged neoplasms. COL1A1 was described as the fusion partner of USP6 in a subset of MO cases, but the fusion partners of USP6-rearranged FOPD have not been uncovered so far. Initially, we carefully reviewed all 27 cases of MO/FOPD from our archives, documenting the remarkable morphological overlap between both lesions. Sixteen cases were seen in consultation and our review was requested to rule in or rule out tentative diagnoses by referring pathologists. Malignant diagnosis (osteosarcoma) was suggested by the submitting pathologists in three cases, while seven cases were sent by the referring pathologists to ""rule out sarcoma"". In the following step, using next generation sequencing, we confirmed the COL1A1-USP6 rearrangement in 5/7 cases of MO and found the same abnormality in 4/5 of FOPD. Overall, nine of the 12 analyzable cases (75%) of MO and FOPD harbored this gene fusion. The presence of COL1A1-USP6 gene rearrangement in MO/FOPD links these lesions to other USP6-driven tumors, and represents a very useful supportive marker, which may help to avoid overdiagnosis of MO/FOPD as a sarcoma.",Follicular cholecystitis: Clinicopathologic associations,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30946935,Human pathology,2019 04 26,"Follicular cholecystitis (FC) is a relatively rare entity with uncertain causal associations.

Remarkably, functional distal biliary obstruction (from choledocholithiasis, sclerosing cholangitis, distal biliary strictures, or malignancies of the pancreatic head or ampulla) was found in 76.7% of the patients, irrespective of the presence of other concurrent histologic findings. FC associated with CC was relatively more common in females (61%) and strongly associated with cholelithiasis (70%). However, those without CC were predominantly males (70%) and had a significant association with LC (75%). All four cases of FC without any other histologic associations who had clinical information available showed some form of distal biliary obstruction. FC cases without concurrent LC were often associated with CC (74%). FC is strongly associated with extrahepatic biliary obstruction distal to the gallbladder. Therefore, this finding at routine cholecystectomy may warrant further evaluation to rule out a cause for distal biliary tract obstruction.

TP53 was the most frequently altered gene (69%). TP53 mutations and ERBB2 amplification were more frequent in SDCXPA than in SDCDN (P=.0007 and P=.01, respectively). Potentially targetable mutations were detected in 79% (23/29) SDC involving ERBB2 (31%), PIK3CA (28%), HRAS (21%), ALK (7%) and BRAF (3%), and 22% (5/23) of those cases harbored possible primary resistance mutations involving CCNE1, NF1 and PTEN.

In another case, EML4-ALK fusion detected in the primary tumor was associated with ALK G1202R secondary resistance mutation in the post-treatment metastasis. A germline analysis of the DNA repair genes revealed a case with a pathogenic BRCA1 E23fs germline variant. SDCDN and SDCXPA are genetically distinct.

We performed Sanger sequencing for SMAD4 mutations and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) analysis of the SMAD4 locus, in addition to immunohistochemistry for SMAD4, to determine its clinicopathological correlations and impacts on survival. The frequency of LOH at the SMAD4 locus was 45.1%, and it was significantly higher in GAED compared to in conventional gastric adenocarcinoma. SMAD4 mutations were not found in any case. Reduced SMAD4 expression was found in 60.8% of cases; it was significantly correlated with advanced stages and lymph node metastasis and showed trends of larger tumor size and lymphatic invasion. Reduced SMAD4 expression in metastatic lymph nodes was found in 21 of 36 cases. Survival analysis revealed that reduced SMAD4 expression significantly affected the patient's overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS), although multivariate analysis showed that only liver metastasis and lymphatic infiltration (Ly+) were independent prognostic factors for OS and RFS. The SMAD4 locus is one of the susceptibility genes in this tumor, although SMAD4 mutation was not detected.

The lack of knowledge regarding the true incidence of encountering bystander latent EBV-positive cells in the bone marrow may potentially lead to a diagnostic dilemma when assessing a staging bone marrow for a patient with an EBV-positive B or T/NK-cell lymphoma. The aim of our study was to investigate the rate of detection of EBV expression in bone marrow samples and correlate any positive findings with various clinical parameters including patient's age, sex, clinical history, immune status, and any neoplastic transformation if follow-up data are available. We retrospectively studied 230 consecutive bone marrow biopsies performed in 2013 and found 5 cases (2.17%) with scattered EBV-positive cells by in situ hybridization. The observed scattered EBV-positive cells are largely small in size and likely represent bystander, latently infected cells.

We aim to investigate the presence of nitrated α-SYN in minor salivary gland biopsy in PD. Patients with PD and age-matched controls underwent minor salivary gland biopsy. Motor impairment was assessed by Hoehn-Yahr (H-Y) stage and Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) Part III in off-state. 11C-methyl-N-2b-carbomethoxy-3b-(4-fluorophenyl) tropane (11C-CFT) DAT-PET scan was performed in all subjects. Immunohistochemical staining for nitrated α-SYN was performed in the minor salivary gland tissues. The minor salivary gland tissues of 8 PD cases and 7 controls with early stage (H-Y stage 1-2) were detected. All PD patients showed asymmetrical and reduction of 11C-CFT uptake in the caudate, anterior and posterior putamen, while all control subjects showed normal DAT-PET scan. Positive nitrated α-SYN immunostaining was observed in all PD patients (8/8,100%) but not in control subjects (0/7). The results were consistent well with that of DAT-PET. These nitrated alpha-synuclein positive structures were mainly located in the periacinar stroma in PD patients. Our result suggests that nitrated α-SYN exists in the early stage and is probably a promising biomarker for PD. Minor salivary gland is an ideal site for α-SYN nitration detection. Despite of the small number of subjects, attention should be given to α-SYN nitration in PD and more investigations on nitrated α-SYN in different sites and large sample using should be explored in future.",Reciprocal interactions between the basolateral amygdala and infralimbic and prelimbic regions of the mPFC: Actions of diazepam.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30946929,Neuroscience letters,2019 05 28,"The basolateral amygdala (BLA) and prelimbic (PL) and infralimbic (IL) cortices are interconnected structures that participate in the regulation of fear.

We performed multiunit activity recordings from one neuronal pool while applying electrical stimulation to another neuronal pool. In the same experimental session, PL-BLA and IL-BLA sequences of stimulation-recording were applied, followed by the inverse sequence (BLA-PL and BLA-IL). Using this procedure, we obtained information from the same neuronal pool that was stimulated and recorded. Using peristimulus histograms, we analyzed neuronal responsivity. In the saline-treated group, the PL-BLA stimulation-recording sequence produced an inhibitory response. The inverse sequence, BLA-PL, produced an excitatory response. For BLA-IL and IL-BLA stimulation-recording sequences, a minimal response was observed in the saline control group. Diazepam minimally affected responsivity of the PL-BLA and BLA-IL connections. Diazepam blocked the initial excitatory response of the IL-BLA connection. Under control conditions, the PL and BLA appeared to regulate each other. Under the action of diazepam, the IL exerted an inhibitory influence on the BLA. Because of the well-known actions of this anxiolytic drug on the BLA, this combined action may result in the synergistic control of fear.","Serotonergic system, cognition, and BPSD in Alzheimer's disease.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30946928,Neuroscience letters,2019 06 10,"Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia (BPSD), present in almost 90% of patients with Alzheimer's Disease (AD), cause extensive impairment leading to reduced independence and inability to complete activities of daily living. Though BPSD includes a wide range of symptoms, such as agitation, aggression, disinhibition, anxiety, depression, apathy, delusions, and hallucinations. Certain BPSD in AD co-present and can be clustered into distinct domains based on their frequency of co-occurrence. As these BPSD are so pervasive in any stages of AD, the disease may be better characterized as a disorder of heterogeneous degenerative symptoms across a number of symptom domains, with the most prominent domain comprising memory and cognitive deficits. Importantly, there are no FDA-approved drugs to treat these BPSD, and new approaches must be considered to develop effective treatments for AD patients. The biogenic monoamine 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), or serotonin, works as both a neurotransmitter and neuromodulator, which has been tied to cognitive decline and multiple BPSD domains. This review summarizes the evidence for specific serotonergic system alterations across some of the well-studied cognitive, behavioral, and psychiatric domains. Though differences in overall serotonergic transmission occur in AD, circuit-specific alterations in individual 5-HT receptors (5-HTRs) are likely linked to the heterogeneous presentation of BPSD in AD.",Phosphorylated NF-κB subunit p65 aggregates in granulovacuolar degeneration and neurites in neurodegenerative diseases with tauopathy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30946927,Neuroscience letters,2019 05 28,"Granulovacuolar degeneration (GVD) was originally reported in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and later found in aging brains. Pathologically, GVD is thought to be associated with the development of tauopathy, but the precise mechanism remains unknown. Previous studies have suggested that GVD contains proteins associated with an inflammatory signal. In this study, we examined phosphorylated p65 (pp65), which is the activated form of a subunit of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB), in the hippocampus of 21 autopsied cases, including AD, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis cases with optineurin mutation (ALS-OPTN), and a variety of other neurodegenerative disorder cases and normal controls. In all cases, GVDs were immunopositive for pp65. The density of pp65-positive GVDs statistically correlated with that of casein kinase 1 delta (CK1δ), which is known as GVD marker. pp65 was also detected in neurites in AD and ALS-OPTN. The number of neurons with pp65-immunoreactive GVD was significantly higher in the AD group than in the non-AD group. Double immunostaining showed the colocalization of CK1δ and pp65. pp65-positive GVD was found in a neuron with AT8-positive neurofibrillary tangles. Moreover, pp65 was also found in neurites that were immunostained with phosphorylated tau, phosphorylated α-synuclein, or TDP-43 (transactivation response element DNA-binding protein 43 kDa). Therefore, the activation of the NF-κB pathway may be related to the pathology of GVD formation and dementia with tauopathy, including AD and ALS-OPTN. We propose that pp65 is useful as a GVD marker, and that the NF-κB pathway could be a therapeutic target not only for AD, but for age-related neurodegenerative diseases in general.",The effect of response complexity on simple reaction time occurs even with a highly predictable imperative stimulus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30946926,Neuroscience letters,2019 05 28,"It is well known that increasing the complexity of the required response results in a corresponding increase in simple reaction time (RT). This ""response complexity effect"" has typically been attributed to increased time required to prepare some aspect of the response; however, most studies examining the response complexity effect have used an unpredictable foreperiod, which does not allow for optimal preparation to occur. Thus, it is conceivable that response complexity effects are influenced by an inability to predict the occurrence of the go-signal. In order to examine this possibility, participants (N = 36) were randomly assigned to one of four groups that differed in predictability of the go signal: 1) 2500-3500 ms random foreperiod; 2) 3000 ms constant foreperiod; 3) 1000 ms constant foreperiod; 4) 3000 ms constant foreperiod with a 1000 ms countdown timer. Participants performed one of three different key-press responses in a simple RT paradigm: 1) single key-press; 2) three key-presses with an equal/isochronous time interval between presses; 3) three key-presses with an unequal/non-isochronous time interval between presses. Results confirmed that while the countdown timer group had an overall reduced RT, response complexity effects were present and of similar magnitude for all groups in all testing blocks. This confirms that predictability of the go signal does not affect the response complexity effect."

Diabetic mice model was established by streptozotocin (STZ, 100 mg/kg) and the treatment groups were treated with two Bupleurum polysaccharides (60 mg/kg) for 6 weeks, respectively. The results showed that the administration of Bupleurum polysaccharides ameliorated diabetic nephropathy induced by STZ.

And the dysbiosis of gut microbiota was modulated with higher diversity and gut protective microbiota. The gut barrier was also improved and the expression of inflammatory response both in kidney and colon was reduced. These results provided the evidence that modulating the gut microbiota and inflammation was involved in the effect of Bupleurum polysaccharides against diabetic nephropathy in mice and laid the foundation for the deeper, specific mechanism research on the interaction between kidney and gut.",Preparation and characterisation of carboxymethyl-chitosan/sodium phytate composite membranes for adsorption in transformer oil.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30946908,International journal of biological macromolecules,2019 05 21,"Adsorption of metal impurities from transformer oil was studied using a novel porous membrane.

The effects of the SP content of the membrane, contact time, and contact temperature on adsorption of copper, iron, and aluminium impurities were studied. The FTIR spectra and thermogravimetric curves of the membranes indicated good compatibility between CMC and SP. The SEM and video camera observations suggested that CMC-SP composite membranes had a mature, porous structure.

In vitro assays demonstrated the cytocompatibility of the hydrogels with encapsulated rat bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSC). Crystal violet assays showed a 27% increase in cell viability when these cells were seeded in hydrogels containing nBG. In vivo biocompatibility was examined by injecting hydrogels into the dorsum of Swiss rats.

Injection of the hydrogels into a rat tibial defect allowed preliminary evaluation of the hydrogels' regenerative potential. Micro Computed Tomography analysis suggested that more new tissue was formed in the defects treated with the hydrogels. Taken together, our data suggest that the developed injectable composite hydrogels possess properties which make them suitable candidates for use as temporary injectable matrices for bone regeneration.",Unfoldness of the denatured state of proteins determines urea: Methylamine counteraction in terms of Gibbs free energy of stabilization.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30946906,International journal of biological macromolecules,2019 05 21,"In many tissues and organisms, large amount of urea gets accumulated to maintain osmotic balance. To evade the threatening impact of urea, living organisms accumulate methylamines, a class of osmolytes, in proportion of 2:1 (urea:methylamine). To understand underlying cause(s) for protein-specific counteraction behavior, thermodynamic stability (ΔGDo) of three disulfide free proteins (myoglobin, bovine cytochrome c and barstar) in the mixture of urea and methylamine has been estimated from guanidinium chloride-(GdmCl) driven denaturation curves. Using the experimentally measured values of ΔGDo obtained in the presence of individual methylamines and urea, we predicted the molar ratio of urea and a methylamine required for perfect compensation for each of the proteins. Interestingly, for all proteins studied, a similar ratio has been observed for perfect compensation. The predicted ratio for perfect compensation in terms of thermodynamic parameters was about 2:1 M ratio of urea to methylamine. Furthermore, a partial counteraction was observed in the myoglobin and barstar. However, for bovine cytochrome c, perfect compensation was observed in both GdmCl- and heat-driven denaturations. Our observations clearly suggest that the counteraction phenomenon depends on the extent of the unfolding of the denatured states of proteins.",Anti-ESBL investigation of chitosan/silver nanocomposites against carbapenem resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30946905,International journal of biological macromolecules,2019 05 21,"In the present investigation functional chitosan/silver nanocomposites (CS/Ag NCs) were successfully synthesized and found to possess favorable antibacterial activity against extended spectrum beta-lactasame (ESBL) producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Powder X-ray diffraction showed that the obtained CS/Ag NCs are constituted of highly crystalline Ag nanoparticles (NPs) embedded in an amorphous CS matrix material. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis provided structural information about CS/Ag NCs, revealing the formation of spherical cluster structures constituted of Ag NPs with size ranging from 6 to 18 nm embedded in the amorphous CS matrix. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of Ag NPs and CS/Ag NCs were found to inhibit the ESBL producing P. aeruginosa at 80 μg/mL (76%) and 50 μg/mL (92%), respectively. Confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images revealed that P. aeruginosa experienced reduced cell viability and morphological cell membrane damage at desired MIC. The in-vivo toxicity effect of Ag NPs and CS/Ag NCs suggested an increased mortality rate when Artemia franciscana were exposed for 24 h to increasing concentrations of Ag NPs and CS/Ag NCs. Anti-ESBL activity and toxicity effect of CS/Ag NCs revealed that these NCs possess promising antibacterial properties to overcome numerous communicable bacterial strains.",Harvest time optimization leads to the production of native cassava starches with different properties.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30946904,International journal of biological macromolecules,2019 05 21,"The starch market is very diverse and demanding regarding the functional characteristics of the product. However, no technique based on the management of cassava root harvest time has been applied to obtain starches with different properties. Thus, in this study, cassava roots were harvested at different times and the structure and physicochemical properties of their starches were analyzed. Results indicated the time points in the first growth cycle of plants when all parameters associated with root growth were at their highest values. It was also observed that changes in the time of harvest leads to the production of starches with different granule size, crystallinity, and content of amylose and phosphorus, which resulted in changes in the thermal and pasting properties, as well as in the solubility of the starches and swelling power; that is, on the main determinant characteristics for applicability of the starches. Planned agricultural production monitoring, coupled with the analysis of the main starches characteristics for large-scale cassava crops, can provide commercial benefits for both farmers and industry, as it is possible to obtain starches with desired physicochemical characteristics for varied applications.",Sclareol-loaded hyaluronan-coated PLGA nanoparticles: Physico-chemical properties and in vitro anticancer features.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30946903,International journal of biological macromolecules,2019 05 21,"Sclareol (labd‑14‑ene‑8,13‑diol), a phytochemical compound belonging to labdane-type diterpenes, has recently attracted noteworthy attention because of its peculiar pharmacological properties. The foremost obstacle to an efficacious application and use of this molecule is its unfavorable bioavailability due to its poor aqueous solubility. In this investigation sclareol was encapsulated within PLGA nanoparticles with the aim of favoring its administration in physiological media, increasing its anticancer activity and obtaining a stable colloidal formulation. These nanoparticles containing sclareol were characterized by a mean diameter of 100-150 nm, a narrow size distribution and a negative surface charge. The active compound was efficiently retained by the polymeric structure and did not induce any physical destabilization. The coating of the PLGA nanoparticles with hyaluronic acid (1.5 MDa) increased the antitumor efficacy of the encapsulated drug against human breast cancer cells expressing the hyaluronan receptors (MCF-7 and MDA-MB468) while a similar pharmacological effect was obtained on human colon carcinoma cells (CaCo-2).

Part B, Biochemistry & molecular biology",2019 05 10,"Transferrin is a highly conserved multifunctional protein involved in iron metabolism, oxidative stress and immune response. However, very little is known about its context-dependent functional role in insects. The present study adopts a proteomic approach to identify an abundant hemolymph protein of silkworm (Antheraea mylitta) as transferrin. SDS-PAGE coupled to LC-MS/MS was followed to identify this protein (75.7 kDa) in the advanced larvae of A. mylitta as transferrin (AmTsf). Antibody developed against this protein enabled us to determine its tissue-specific expression and functional relevance during development. Its immunodetection was optimized by western blotting, immunohisto- and cytochemistry in the larval and pupal tissues of this insect. AmTsf exhibited a considerable homology with that of other related insects. It was found to be expressed constitutively in hemolymph, fat body, midgut and silk gland of this insect during development. Abundance of transferrin in the hemolymph of this species and its upregulation in response to oxidant challenges indicated its tissue-specific role in the antioxidant protection. The present work adds to the existing knowledge of multiple roles of transferrin in insects and provides an insight into a relatively unexplored aspect of iron-associated H2O2 metabolism and redox homeostasis in the apparent absence of catalase and glutathione peroxidase. Therefore, A. mylitta can be an attractive acatalasemic model for the study of in vivo redox regulation. In addition, this study provides a novel hypothesis to explore the role of transferrin in limiting oxidative stress during larval rearing of silkworm.",Molecular basis for feedback inhibition of tyrosine-regulated 3-deoxy-d-arabino-heptulosonate-7-phosphate synthase from Escherichia coli.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30946901,Journal of structural biology,2019 05 18,"3-Deoxy-d-arabino-heptulosonate-7-phosphate synthase (DAHPS) is responsible for the biosynthesis of essential aromatic compounds in microorganisms and plants. It plays a crucial role in the regulation of the carbon flow into the shikimate pathway. Until now, the crystal structures and regulatory mechanisms of dimeric DAHPS enzymes from type Iα subclass have not been reported. Here, we reported dimeric structures of the tyrosine-regulated DAHPS from Escherichia coli, both in its apo form and complex with the inhibitor tyrosine at 2.5 and 2.0 Å resolutions, respectively. DAHPS(Tyr) has a typical (β/α)8 TIM barrel, which is decorated with an N-terminal extension and an antiparallel β sheet, β6a/β6b. Inhibitor tyrosine binds at a cavity formed by residues of helices α3, α4, strands β6a, β6b and the adjacent loops, and directly interacts with residues P148, Q152, S181, I213 and N8*. Although the small angle X-ray scattering profiles from DAHPS(Tyr) with and without tyrosine shows that tyrosine binding leaves most of DAHPS(Tyr) structures unaffected. The comparison of the liganded and unliganded crystal structures reveals that conformational changes of residues P148, Q152 and I213 initiate a transmission pathway to propagate the allosteric signal from the tyrosine-binding site to the active site, which is different from DAHPS(Phe), a phenylalanine-regulated isozyme from E. coli. In addition, mutations of five tyrosine-binding residues P148, Q152, S181, I213 and N8* leads to tyrosine-resistant DAHPS(Tyr) enzymes. These findings provide a new insight into the regulatory mechanism of DAHPS enzymes and a basis for further engineering studies."

Preimplantation genetic testing on chromosomal structural rearrangement (PGT-SR) offers a way to screen against unbalanced embryos. Here, we demonstrated a new method to distinguish carrier from noncarrier embryos. Translocation breakpoints were first delineated by nanopore sequencing followed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) across breakpoints. High-resolution breakpoint mapping was successful in all (9/9) balanced reciprocal translocation carriers. Retrospective analysis of their embryo biopsies with breakpoint PCR showed 100% concordant results with PGT-SR on trophectoderm biopsies (40/40) and 53% concordance on blastomere biopsies (8/15). The low concordant rate in blastomeres was due to failure in the amplification of derivative chromosomes involving large deletions. Breakpoint PCR also showed 100% concordant results with prenatal/postnatal outcomes on 5 pregnancies, indicating that our new method can accurately distinguish carrier from noncarrier embryos.",Adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells ameliorate bone marrow aplasia related with graft-versus-host disease in experimental murine models.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30946889,Transplant immunology,2019 04 16,"Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) constitutes the most frequent complications after the allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for a variety of hematological malignancies. In the present study, we explored the prophylactic potential of adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (AD-MSCs) in controlling GVHD in murine models with a special focus on bone marrow aplasia related with acute GVHD. The CB6F1 mice were induced GVHD by the injection intravenously of C57BL/6 (B6-Ly-5.1) splenocytes without conditioning irradiation or chemotherapy. AD-MSCs from C3H mice were injected intravenously via tail veins. GVHD was assessed using flowcytometry analysis of peripheral blood cells and histopathologic analysis of target organs. Histopathological analyses revealed that AD-MSCs markedly suppressed the infiltration of lymphocytes into liver as well as the aplasia in bone marrow. This study is the first to clarify the effectiveness of AD-MSCs against bone marrow aplasia in GVHD, supporting a rationale of AD-MSCs for ameliorating bone marrow suppression and infectivity after allo-HSCT in human clinics.",Longitudinal Retinal Perfusion Status in Eyes with Diabetic Macular Edema Receiving Intravitreal Aflibercept or Laser in VISTA Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30946887,Ophthalmology,2019 05 09,To evaluate changes in retinal perfusion status with intravitreal aflibercept injection (IAI) and laser treatment in the phase 3 VISTA study of patients with diabetic macular edema (DME).,Flap valve of the heart foramen ovale revisited: macroscopic and histologic observations of human near-term fetuses.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30946886,Annals of anatomy = Anatomischer Anzeiger : official organ of the Anatomische Gesellschaft,2019 05 31,"We assessed the flap valve of the foramen ovale (FO valve) by examining 30 hearts from human fetuses of gestational age 30-40 weeks. We dissected the hearts, examined their macroscopic morphology, and then prepared semiserial sagittal sections across the valve. Although the primary septum is expected to extend along the left atrial face, eight hearts had a superior rim of the fossa ovalis on the left atrial face that was too thick and high, so there was no smooth continuation with the valve. Moreover, three of these eight hearts each had a flap valve that was fused with a long and narrow plate arising from the caval orifice. Histological analysis indicated that 21 specimens each had a candidate primary septum that contained myocardium, although the left sinuatrial valve (LSAV) contained fibrous tissue, but little or no myocardium. In each of 17 hearts, a candidate primary septum was attached to the left atrial face of the fossa, and parts of the LSAV extended to and approached the right atrial face. However, seven of these 17 hearts each had a folded small primary septum. Another four of these 17 hearts each had an LSAV that extended widely to the fossa, and a candidate primary septum (which might be a remnant) attached to the left atrial side of the LSAV. These variations suggest that the LSAV makes a major contribution to the FO valve in some fetal hearts. Consequently, the fetal FO valve appears to have heterogeneous morphology and origin.","Prolonged exposure of rats to varenicline increases anxiety and alters serotonergic system, but has no effect on memory.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30946884,"Pharmacology, biochemistry, and behavior",2019 06 01,"Varenicline is a drug used for smoking addiction cessation treatment and acts as a partial agonist of nicotinic cholinergic receptors. Recent clinical trial data support use of varenicline for treatment of conditions/addictions that are not related to smoking cessation. Considering the importance of this issue and the need for new studies on its effects, especially on behavior, more studies using animal models are necessary. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of prolonged exposure to varenicline in anxiety-like behavior and memory, as well as in cerebral neurochemistry of rats. Male rats received three different doses of varenicline: 0.03 (therapeutic dose for humans), 0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg orally (gavage) for 30 days. Animal behavior was analyzed through open field, elevated plus maze, light/dark box, social interaction, Barnes maze and novel object recognition tests. Neurotransmitter levels and their metabolites in different brain structures (hippocampus, striatum and frontal cortex) were measured. Results showed that prolonged exposure of rats to varenicline: 1) did not interfere in motor activity, but caused an anxiogenic effect on elevated plus maze, light/dark box and social interaction testes; 2) did not alter memory; and 3) promoted alterations on serotoninergic system in the striatum and frontal cortex. In conclusion, compilation of the data indicates that prolonged exposure of rats to varenicline promoted anxiogenic effects and alteration in serotonergic system, which corroborated behavioral findings.",Interoceptive awareness is associated with acute alcohol-induced changes in subjective effects.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30946883,"Pharmacology, biochemistry, and behavior",2019 06 01,"Interoception, the sensing of bodily signals, is related to emotional reactivity and may contribute to the pathophysiology of addiction. Evidence is accumulating that individuals with alcohol use disorders and other substance-dependences show altered interoceptive processing, however little is known about the acute effects of alcohol on interoception and how this may influence the perception of drug induced effects. In a double-blind design, fifty (30 females) healthy young participants were given a beverage containing either a low (0.4 g/kg, n = 18) or high (0.6 g/kg, n = 15) alcohol dose or a placebo (n = 17). After alcohol administration, participants completed two interoceptive paradigms, the heart-beat tracking and heart-beat discrimination tasks, both assessing different accuracy and metacognitive measures of interoception. Subjective feelings elicited by alcohol administration were also measured. Participants under the low alcohol dose had lower metacognitive interoceptive awareness on the discrimination task compared to placebo. Participants under alcohol experienced feelings of light-headedness, which were positively associated with increased interoceptive awareness in the cardiac discrimination task. These results provide evidence for a relationship between interoceptive processing and the perception of drug-induced mood changes. This finding, showing how interoceptive awareness of cardiac discrimination contributes to the appraisal of subjective light-headedness generated by alcohol administration, brings novel perspectives to the understanding of drug discrimination and reinforcement mechanisms.",Neurobiological substrates of persistent working memory deficits and cocaine-seeking in the prelimbic cortex of rats with a history of extended access to cocaine self-administration.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30946882,Neurobiology of learning and memory,2019 05 22,"Cocaine use disorder (CUD) is associated with prefrontal cortex dysfunction and cognitive deficits that may contribute to persistent relapse susceptibility. As the relationship between cognitive deficits, cortical abnormalities and drug seeking is poorly understood, development of relevant animal models is of high clinical importance. Here, we used an animal model to characterize working memory and reversal learning in rats with a history of extended access cocaine self-administration and prolonged abstinence. We also investigated immediate and long-term functional changes within the prelimbic cortex (PrL) in relation to cognitive performance and drug-seeking. Adult male rats underwent 6 days of short-access (1 h/day) followed by 12 days of long-access (6 h/day) cocaine self-administration, or received passive saline infusions. Next, rats were tested in delayed match-to-sample (DMS) and (non)match-to-sample (NMS) tasks, and finally in a single context + cue relapse test on day 90 of abstinence. We found that a history of chronic cocaine self-administration impaired working memory, though sparing reversal learning, and that the components of these cognitive measures correlated with later drug-seeking. Further, we found that dysregulated metabolic activity and mGlu5 receptor signaling in the PrL of cocaine rats correlated with past working memory performance and/or drug-seeking, as indicated by the analysis of cytochrome oxidase reactivity, mGlu5 and Homer 1b/c protein expression, as well as Arc mRNA expression in mGlu5-positive cells. These findings advocate for a persistent post-cocaine PrL dysfunction, rooted in ineffective compensatory changes and manifested as impaired working memory performance and hyperreactivity to cocaine cues. Considering the possible interplay between the neural correlates underlying post-cocaine cognitive deficits and drug-seeking, cognitive function should be evaluated and considered when developing neurobiologically-based treatments of cocaine relapse.",miR-93-5p targets Smad7 to regulate the transforming growth factor-β1/Smad3 pathway and mediate fibrosis in drug-resistant prolactinoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30946881,Brain research bulletin,2019 06 14,"Prolactinoma is a common subtype of pituitary tumors. Dopamine receptor agonists are the preferred treatment for prolactinoma; however, with this therapy, drug resistance often occurs. In our previous work, we found that partial resistant prolactinomas showed increased fibrosis and that the transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1/Smad3 signaling pathway mediated fibrosis and was involved in drug resistance. Additionally, the success of surgery is known to be heavily influenced by the consistency of the pituitary adenoma. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to clarify the mechanisms of fibrosis in prolactinoma. Using high-throughput sequencing for analysis of microRNAs, we found that miR-93-5p was significantly upregulated in prolactinoma samples with a high degree of fibrosis compared with that in samples without fibrosis. Furthermore, we found that miR-93-5p was negatively correlated with the relative expression of Smad7 and positively correlated with the relative expression of TGF-β1 in clinical prolactinoma samples. In addition, luciferase reporter assays showed that miR-93-5p could downregulate the Smad7 gene, an important inhibitor of the TGF-β1/Smad3 signaling pathway, and activate TGF-β1/Smad3 signaling-mediated fibrosis in a feed-forward loop. Moreover, miR-93-5p could enhance the drug resistance of prolactinoma cells by regulation of TGF-β1/Smad3-dependent fibrosis. Taken together, our findings demonstrated that miR-93-5p may be a potential therapeutic target for inhibiting fibrosis and reducing drug resistance in prolactinoma cells.",Common spatial pattern and wavelet decomposition for motor imagery EEG- fTCD brain-computer interface.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30946880,Journal of neuroscience methods,2019 04 12,"Recently, hybrid brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) combining more than one modality have been investigated with the aim of boosting the performance of the existing single-modal BCIs in terms of accuracy and information transfer rate (ITR).

It is unknown if the underlying facets of Openness are associated with cardiovascular responsivity, and whether adaptation is evident across active and passive stress. The objective of this study was to determine if the facets of Openness are related to cardiovascular reactivity and adaptation across active and passive stress exposures. Personality measures and continuous cardiovascular data from sixty-six female adults across a protocol of active and passive stress tasks were collated. Multiple regression analysis revealed that the facet of Feelings was associated with systolic blood pressure (SBP) reactivity to active stress. Examination of cardiovascular adaption revealed that the facet of Feelings was positively associated with SBP and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) adaptation, whereas the facet of Actions demonstrated a negative association. Supplementary analyses revealed the significant effects for Feelings were not reliant on the remaining Openness facets, whereas the significant effects for Actions were. No significant effects emerged for the higher-order trait of Openness. These findings suggest that the underlying facet of Feelings is associated with active stress reactivity, with the facets of Feelings and Actions appearing to be of importance to cardiovascular adaptation.

We performed the first study in Chinese children (primary school Grade 4) that applied the wearable cameras in assisting dietary recall. Children (n = 52) wore the wearable cameras (Narrative Clip 2) for seven consecutive days, during which they completed a 3-day 24-h dietary recall at home. Then children modified their dietary recalls at school by reviewing the photos taken by the wearable camera at school, with the assistance of the investigator, and generated the camera-assisted 24-h dietary recalls. Compared with camera-assisted dietary recalls, 8% (n = 160) and 1% (n = 11) of food items were underreported (i.e. not reported at all) and misreported (i.e. reported in an incorrect amount) by dietary recalls without camera-assistance, respectively. Dietary recalls without camera assistance underestimated daily energy intake by 149 ± 182 kcal/d (8%) in comparison to the camera-assisted dietary recalls. Foods consumed on the snacking occasions (40%) were more likely to be underreported than those consumed at main meals (P < 0.001). Beverages (37%), fruits (30%), snacks and desserts (16%) were foods most likely to be inaccurately reported. Children were satisfied with the wearable cameras, with a median score 5.0 (IQR: 5.0-5.0) for most features. Wearable cameras hold promise for improving accuracy of dietary intake assessment in children, providing rich objective information on dietary behaviours, and received high level of satisfaction and compliance of the users. Our results suggest that the accuracy of dietary recall among Chinse school-aged children could be improved by wearable camera, especially avoiding underreporting in the snacking occasions.",Appetitive characteristics in children with cystic fibrosis: Questionnaire validation and associations with nutritional status.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30946864,Appetite,2019 06 08,"Appetitive characteristics are an important factor in the nutritional status of children with cystic fibrosis (CF).

Furthermore, Erianin triggered apoptosis via caspase cascades activation and the mitochondrial-mediated apoptotic pathway. Bim up-regulation and Bcl-2 down-regulation as the symbol of apoptosis which were found to play the dominant role in the effects of Erianin. We further showed that JNK pathway activation is necessary for the Erianin-mediated anti-proliferation and apoptotic response. Finally, Erianin exhibited anti-tumour activity and induced apoptosis in tumour tissue in vivo. Collectively, these results suggest that Erianin induced cell cycle G2/M-phase arrest and apoptosis via the JNK signalling pathway in bladder cancer, indicating the potential usefulness of Erianin for the therapy of bladder cancer.",A comparison of asbestos fiber potency and elongate mineral particle (EMP) potency for mesothelioma in humans.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30946862,Toxicology and applied pharmacology,2019 04 22,"Dr. Garabrant presented a paper concerning a comparison of asbestos fiber potency and elongate mineral particle (EMP) potency for mesothelioma in humans at the Elongate Mineral Particles Conference in Charlottesville, Virginia in 2017.

These findings are important because they suggest a relatively simple route by which cooperation can evolve. But it remains to be seen just how robust the walk away strategy is to ecologically important variables such as population density, strategic error, and offspring dispersal. The results of our simulation experiments show that the evolutionary success of walk away cooperators decreases with decreasing population density and/or with increasing error. This relationship is best explained by the ways in which population density and error jointly affect the opportunity cost of walking away. This opportunity cost also explains why naive cooperators regularly outcompete walk away cooperators in pair-wise competition, something not observed in previous studies. Our results further show that local offspring dispersal can inhibit the evolution of cooperation by negating the protection low population density affords the most vulnerable cooperators. Our research identifies socio-ecological conditions in which forgiveness trumps flight in the spatial iterated prisoner's dilemma.",Restoring emotional stability: Cortisol effects on the neural network of cognitive emotion regulation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30946860,Behavioural brain research,2019 05 05,"Effective emotion regulation in stressful contexts is a key feature of mental health. Acute stress, however, impairs prefrontal top-down control, probably leading to a decline of emotion regulatory capacities. By contrast, the delayed cortisol increase in response to a stressor or after a pharmacological manipulation has been linked to mood-protecting effects and emotion regulation success. In this functional magnetic resonance imaging study, healthy men and women received either 30 mg cortisol or placebo 90 min before they were exposed to an emotion regulation paradigm involving neutral and negative pictures. As expected, behavioural and brain imaging data indicated successful induction and downregulation of negative emotions via cognitive reappraisal and distraction. Cortisol enhanced regulatory activity in the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex when participants used distraction and reduced emotion-related activation in the amygdala when regulating emotions via cognitive reappraisal. Together, these findings provide first evidence for a delayed glucocorticoid-induced facilitation of cognitive emotion regulation processes that might be beneficial for restoring emotional stability in the aftermath of stressful events.",Neurokinin-1 receptor antagonist decreases [Ca2+]i in airway smooth muscle cells by reducing the reverse-mode Na+/Ca2+ exchanger current.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30946859,Peptides,2019 05 05,"Airway smooth muscle (ASM) is involved in asthma airway inflammation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of substance P and neurokinin-1 receptor (NK-1R) antagonist on intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) in airway smooth muscle cells (ASMCs), ASMC contraction, and the effect on reverse-mode Na+-Ca2+ exchanger (NCX) currents in ASMCs. In our study, primary rat ASMCs were cultured. ASMCs were identified by immunofluorescence. [Ca2+]i variations were measured by fluorescence microscopy. Cell shortening (%) and relaxation (%) were analyzed with phase-contrast microscopy. Patch clamp techniques were used to assess NCX currents in ASMCs. We found that substance P increased, and NK-1R antagonist decreased [Ca2+]i in ASMCs. Substance P induced ASMCs contraction, and NK-1R antagonist can make ASMC relax. Patch clamp techniques were implemented to analyze NCX currents in ASMCs. Substance P increased reverse-mode NCX currents in ASMCs but the current density was lower than the one treated with acetylcholine (Ach). NK-1R antagonist reduced reverse-mode NCX current activity in ASMCs, and the current density was similar to the one treated with the reversed NCX inhibitor. So, we concluded that substance P increased [Ca2+]i in ASMCs by promoting the reverse-mode NCX current and stimulating ASMCs, whereas NK-1R antagonist decreased [Ca2+]i in ASMCs by decreasing the reverse-mode NCX current to make ASMCs relax.","Trends in colonoscopy and fecal occult blood test use after the introduction of dual screening offers in Germany: Results from a large population-based study, 2003-2016.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30946858,Preventive medicine,2019 05 24,"An increasing number of countries have recently introduced colorectal cancer (CRC) screening programs. Typically, one specific screening exam, such as fecal occult blood test (FOBT) or flexible sigmoidoscopy, is offered as a primary screening test. We aimed to assess trends in FOBT and colonoscopy use in Germany following the introduction of the offer of screening colonoscopy as an alternative to FOBT in 2002. We used data from 4052 control participants aged 50-79 years recruited during 2003-2016 for a population-based case-control study in Germany. Prevalence of FOBT and colonoscopy lifetime and recent use was analyzed and trends over time were examined. The percentage of all respondents who had ever undergone a colonoscopy (for either screening or diagnostic purpose) increased markedly over time from 44.6% in 2003-2005 to 57.5% in 2013-2016 (p < 0.0001). Large increases were also observed for colonoscopy use within 10 years (from 38.0% to 52.8%, p < 0.0001), whereas FOBT uptake within one to two years declined from 54.0% to 33.3%. By 2013-2016, 67.2% of respondents either had an FOBT within one to two years or a colonoscopy within 10 years, and this percentage had remained relatively stable over time. This study demonstrates a large increase in colonoscopy utilization since colonoscopy was included as an alternative primary screening test, which was accompanied by a substantial decline in FOBT use. Although the overall adherence to CRC screening recommendations remained stable, the substantial shift of share from FOBT to colonoscopy is expected to yield more protection against CRC incidence and mortality.",Arsenic trioxide blocked proliferation and cardiomyocyte differentiation of human induced pluripotent stem cells: Implication in cardiac developmental toxicity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30946857,Toxicology letters,2019 05 06,"Arsenic trioxide (ATO) has been recommended as the first-line agent for the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL), due to its substantial anticancer effect. Numerous clinical reports have indicated that ATO is a developmental toxicant which can result in birth defects of human beings. But whether arsenic trioxide can lead to human cardiac developmental toxicity remains largely unknown. So the present study aims to explore the influence and mechanisms of ATO on human cardiac development by using a vitro cardiac differentiation model of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). Here we found that clinically achievable concentrations (0.1, 0.5 and 1 μM) of ATO resulted in a significant inhibition of proliferation during the whole process of cardiac differentiation of hiPSCs. Meanwhile, TUNEL assay revealed that ATO could cause cell apoptosis during cardiac differentiation in a concentration-dependent manner. Consistently, we found that ATO reduced the expressions of mesoderm markers Brachyury and EOMES, cardiac progenitor cell markers GATA-4, MESP-1 and TBX-5, and cardiac specific marker α-actinin in differentiated hiPSCs. Furthermore, ATO treatment had caused DNA damage which was shown in the upregulation of γH2AX, a sensitive marker for DNA double-strand breaks. Taken together, ATO blocked cardiomyocyte differentiation, induced apoptosis and cell growth arrest during cardiac differentiation of hiPSCs, which might be associated with DNA damage."

Due to the lack of animal models, however, its underlying mechanisms remain poorly explored. Moreover, most social support effects are exerted through grooming or consolation behavior from close social bonds, whether pure companionship without physical interaction exert effects still remains unknown. Here, we report that among the most widely used laboratory mouse, social avoidance and anxiety-related behaviors induced by chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) were alleviated by the presence of their pregnant partner without body contact during the stress process, whereas non-pregnant females did not afford similar protective effect to the male partner. The levels of BDNF, together with its primary transcripts, were down-regulated in the hippocampus of male mice with CSDS and these decreases were ameliorated by the presence of their pregnant partners. Furthermore, miR-30a negatively regulated BDNF expression and the regulation of miR-30a was implicated in the supporting effect on the male mice experiencing CSDS. The identification of psychological protective effects in a primary model organism and its underlying mechanism would promote our understanding how people cope with stress-induced psychiatric disorders independent of anti-depressant drugs and facilitate investigation of the molecular mechanisms of enduring social bonds in humans.",Bifurcation manifolds in predator-prey models computed by Gröbner basis method.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30946845,Mathematical biosciences,2019 05 19,"Many natural processes studied in population biology, systems biology, biochemistry, chemistry or physics are modeled by dynamical systems with polynomial or rational right-hand sides in state and parameter variables. The problem of finding bifurcation manifolds of such discrete or continuous dynamical systems leads to a problem of finding solutions to a system of non-linear algebraic equations. This approach often fails since it is not possible to express equilibria explicitly. Here we describe an algebraic procedure based on the Gröbner basis computation that finds bifurcation manifolds without computing equilibria. Our method provides formulas for bifurcation manifolds in commonly studied cases in applied research - for the fold, transcritical, cusp, Hopf and Bogdanov-Takens bifurcations. The method returns bifurcation manifolds as implicitly defined functions or parametric functions in full parameter space. The approach can be implemented in any computer algebra system; therefore it can be used in applied research as a supporting autonomous computation even by non-experts in bifurcation theory. This paper demonstrates our new approach on the recently published Rosenzweig-MacArthur predator-prey model generalizations in order to highlight the simplicity of our method compared to the published analysis.","Transcriptome and proteome analyses to investigate the molecular underpinnings of cold response in the Colorado potato beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30946844,Cryobiology,2019 05 27,"The Colorado potato beetle (Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Say)) is an insect that can cope with prolonged periods of low temperatures exposure. The molecular changes required to adapt to such conditions have not been thoroughly investigated in this insect. The current work aims at characterizing deregulated transcripts and proteins in adult L. decemlineata exposed to 15 °C and -5 °C using RNA-sequencing-based transcriptomics and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)-based proteomics approaches, respectively. RNA-sequencing highlighted the differential expression of several transcripts, including ubiquilin-1 and ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase 5, in insects submitted to low temperatures when compared with control insects. In addition, proteomics approach detected 2840 proteins in cold-exposed beetles including elevated levels for 409 proteins and reduced levels for 200 proteins. Cuticular proteins CP1, CP4, CP5 and CP7 as well as eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4B were notable proteins with elevated levels in cold insects. Functional analysis of targets modulated at low temperatures using DAVID indicated processes likely affected under cold conditions including select metabolic cascades and RNA-associated processes. Overall, this work presents molecular candidates impacted by low temperatures exposure in L. decemlineata and builds on the current knowledge associated with response to these conditions in this insect.",Plakophilin 1 is methylated and has a tumor suppressive activity in human lung cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30946843,Experimental and molecular pathology,2019 05 24,"Plakophilin 1 (PKP1) is an important plaque component of desmosomes, major intercellular adhesive junctions that act as anchorage points for intermediate filaments.

However, their production is still limited and requires more efficient and adaptive technologies. The more common systems are high-shear homogenization such as microfludizers at industrial scale and ultrasounds at research scale, both based on high energy, limiting their application for sensitive drugs. Recently a process based on premix membrane emulsification (PME) was developed to produce nanoemulsions. These 3 processes have been compared for the production of a model parenteral nanoemulsion containing all-trans retinoic acid, a thermolabile molecule that is used in the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia in a parenteral form. Droplet size and active integrity were studied because of their major interest for efficacy and safety assessment. Regarding droplet size, PME produced monodispersed droplets of 335 nm compared with the other processes that produced nanoemulsions of around 150 nm but with the presence of micron-size droplets detected by laser diffraction and optical microscopy. No real difference between the 3 processes was observed on active degradation during emulsifcation. However regarding stability, especially at 40°C, nanoemulsions obtained with the microfluidizer showed a greater molecule degradation and unstable nanoemulsion with a 4-times droplet size increase under stress conditions.",Minimal modulation of macrocyclic lactone susceptibility in Caenorhabditis elegans following inhibition of cytochrome P450 monooxygenase activity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30946841,Experimental parasitology,2019 05 14,"Anthelmintic and in particular macrocyclic lactone (ML) resistance is a widespread problem in trichostrongyloid parasitic nematodes, yet mechanisms of ML resistance are still poorly understood. In the absence of target-site changes in resistant parasite field populations, increased drug extrusion and xenobiotic metabolism have been implicated in modification of susceptibility to MLs. In addition to P-glycoproteins, cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (CYPs) were considered to be involved in ML resistance. CYPs are highly divergent in nematodes with about 80 genes in the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans. Using larval development assays in the C. elegans model, piperonyl butoxide (PBO) and a temperature-sensitive variant of the emb-8 cytochrome reductase were used for chemical and genetic ablation of CYP activity. Additionally, a loss-of-function variant of cyp-14A5 was characterized to determine whether increased expression of this CYP in an ivermectin (IVM)-tolerant C. elegans line might be related to the phenotype. In a preliminary experiment with PBO, susceptibility to 5 nM IVM was synergistically increased by PBO. However, effects of genetic ablation of CYP activity on the EC50 values were small (1.5-fold decrease) for IVM and not significant for moxidectin (MOX). However, due to the steep concentration-response-curves, there were again strong differences between the wild-type and the CYP deficient genotype at individual IVM but not MOX concentrations. Although these results suggest small but significant effects on the susceptibility level of C. elegans to IVM, the cyp14A5 gene proposed by a previous study as candidate was ruled out since it was neither IVM/MOX inducible nor did a strain with a loss-of-function allele show increased susceptibility to either drug. In conclusion, the effect of the CYP system on IVM susceptibility in C. elegans is at best low while effects on MOX susceptibility were not detected. The previously suggested candidate cyp14A5 could be excluded to be involved in ML metabolism.",Inducible brown/beige adipocytes in retro-orbital adipose tissues.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30946840,Experimental eye research,2019 06 14,"Beige adipocytes and brown adipocytes can generate heat by using mitochondrial uncoupling protein 1 (Ucp1), a thermogenic protein. Browning/beiging is the emergence of beige adipocytes in white adipose tissues (WAT) for cold acclimatization. Here we show the existence of brown/beige adipocytes in retro-orbital WAT in mice. Histologically, Ucp1-positive cells with multilocular lipid droplets were abundant in retro-orbital WAT of immature mice; those cells decreased in number with age. However, Ucp1-positive adipocytes with multilocular lipid droplets emerged in retro-orbital WAT in adult mice, due to cold exposure as short as 3 h. Consistent with this observation, the expression level of Ucp1 mRNA was enhanced in tissues upon cold exposure. Furthermore, eye surface temperature remained within a physiological range during cold challenge. RT-qPCR suggested a mixed phenotype of brown and beige adipocytes in retro-orbital WAT. Transmission electron microscopic observation showed multiple lipid droplets and numerous mitochondria with high cristae density in retro-orbital WAT cells from both control and cold-exposed mice. Our results suggest that warming of the orbital cavity by browning/beiging in retro-orbital WAT is a protective mechanism against cold cataract caused by lowered lens temperature.",Activation of KRas-ERK1/2 signaling drives the initiation and progression of glioma by suppressing the acetylation of histone H4 at lysine 16.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30946839,Life sciences,2019 05 13,"Acetylation of H4 at lysine 16 (H4K16ac) has been well-characterized as an acetylated mark, and the expression of which is closely associated with the tumorigenesis of human cancers.

Albeit strenuous exercise itself induces temporary hypoxia which causes myocardial damage and this vitiosus circulus is poorly understood and has been assumed difficult to break. Present investigation targets temporal dynamics of aerobic exercise treatment induced preconditioning against diabetes associated pre- and post- myocardial injury. The persisting high blood sugar level leads to several biochemical alterations at pre- and post-MI phase. Here, we present the assessment of temporal expression of cardiac biomarkers (CKMB, LDH, cTnI and serum nitrite/nitrate), oxidative stress (myocardial TBARS and reduced NBT), inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-α and IL-10), renal biomarkers (BUN, serum creatinine and microproteinuria) and structural alterations of cardio-renal tissue. Aerobic exercise preconditioning significantly downregulate the pathological events or biomarkers and upsurge the physiological biomarkers at both pre- and post-MI phase. The attenuation or returning of pathological makers to lowest level at different time points endorses the therapeutic management of aerobic exercise against diabetic MI. Furthermore, the temporal expression of various cardio-renal biomarkers pattern elucidates that aerobic exercise preconditioning boost the strength and consolidate the cardiac muscles to work under stress. Despite the presence of traditional knowledge about health benefits of aerobic exercise, it is yet to be brought into the clinical arena. In spite of few impending challenges subjected to additional investigations, aerobic exercise preconditioning shows a high degree of promise.",Pressure overload inhibits glucocorticoid receptor transcriptional activity in cardiomyocytes and promotes pathological cardiac hypertrophy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30946837,Journal of molecular and cellular cardiology,2019 05 06,"Glucocorticoid receptor (GR) is abundantly expressed in cardiomyocytes. However, the role of GR in regulating cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure in response to pressure overload remains unclear. Cardiomyocyte-specific GR knockout (GRcKO) mice, mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) knockout (MRcKO), and GR and MR double KO (GRMRdcKO) mice were generated using the Cre-lox system. In response to pressure overload, GRcKO mice displayed worse cardiac remodeling compared to control (GRf/f) mice, including a greater increase in heart weight to body weight ratio with a greater increase in cardiomyocytes size, a greater decline in left ventricular contractility, and higher reactivation of fetal genes. MRcKO mice showed a comparable degree of cardiac remodeling compared to control (MRf/f) mice. The worse cardiac remodeling in pressure overloaded GRcKO mice is not due to compensatory activation of cardiomyocyte MR, since pressure overloaded GRMRdcKO mice displayed cardiac remodeling to the same extent as GRcKO mice. Pressure overload suppressed GR-target gene expression in the heart. Although plasma corticosterone levels and subcellular localization of GR (nuclear/cytoplasmic GR) were not changed, a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay revealed that GR recruitment onto the promoter of GR-target genes was significantly suppressed in response to pressure overload. Rescue of the expression of GR-target genes to the same extent as sham-operated hearts attenuated adverse cardiac remodeling in pressure-overloaded hearts. Thus, GR works as a repressor of adverse cardiac remodeling in response to pressure overload, but GR-mediated transcription is suppressed under pressure overload. Therapies that maintain GR-mediated transcription in cardiomyocytes under pressure overload can be a promising therapeutic strategy for heart failure."

The global burden of food-borne diseases for 31 selected hazards was estimated by the World Health Organization at 33 million disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) in 2010 with 40% of this burden concentrated among children under 5 years of age. The highest burden per population of food-borne diseases is found in Africa, followed by Southeast Asia and the Eastern Mediterranean sub-regions. Unsafe water used for the cleaning and processing of food is a key risk factors contributing to food-borne diseases. The role of quality and quantity of water to the general burden of infectious diseases deserves attention, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, as its effects go beyond the food chain. Water-related infectious diseases are a major cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide, and climate change effects will exacerbate the challenges for the public health sector for both food-borne and water-borne diseases. Selected case studies from Africa and Asia show that (i) climate change extreme events, such as floods, may exacerbate the risks for infectious diseases spreading through water systems, and (ii) improvements related to drinking water, sanitation and hygiene could result in a significant reduction of intestinal parasitic infections among school-aged children. There is a need to better anticipate the impacts of climate change on infectious diseases and fostering multi-stakeholder engagement and multi-sectoral collaborations for integrated interventions at schools, community and household levels.

The efficient removal of such metal complexes is an imperative but still challenging task due to their stable structure and high mobility. Herein, we propose a new strategy to remove Cu-carboxyl complexes from high-salinity water by using a commercially available nanocomposite HZO-201, i.e., nanohydrated zirconium oxide (HZO) confined inside anion exchanger D201. In contrast to D201 and a cation exchanger D001, which both adsorb Cu-citrate negligibly, HZO-201 exhibits preferable adsorption toward Cu-citrate (∼130 mg Cu/g-Zr) at high salinity (1.5 wt % NaCl). On the basis of scanning transmission electron microscopy energy-dispersive spectrometry (STEM-EDS), attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR), and X-ray photoelectron spectrometry (XPS) analysis, the formation of ternary complex among Cu(II), citrate, and the embedded nano-HZO is evidenced to be responsible for the removal of Cu-citrate. The exhausted HZO-201 can be regenerated with a binary HCl-NaCl solution for repeated use for 5 cycles without capacity loss. Fixed-bed adsorption demonstrates that HZO-201 column is capable of producing ∼1150 bed volume (BV) clean water (<0.5 mg Cu/L) from simulated high-salinity wastewater, whereas only ∼10 BV and ∼60 BV was produced for the D001 and D201 columns, respectively. Furthermore, HZO-201 shows excellent removal of Cu(II) complexes with three other carboxyl ligands (oxalate, tartrate, and succinate).",Tuning the Wettability of a Thin Polymer Film by Gradually Changing the Geometry of Nanoscale Pore Edges.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30946782,Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids,2019 04 30,"Controlling wetting of solids by liquids attracts attention because of its scientific and technological importance. In this paper, the wettability of a highly uniform porous poly(methyl methacrylate) film on a silicon substrate containing a high density of randomly distributed self-similar pores was gradually tuned by changing the shape of nanometric crownlike structures around the pores. Fine-tuning the topography of these thin films was performed by isothermal annealing. The equilibrium contact angle of a water droplet placed on the surface of the films could be varied from 72 to 102°. The contact angle changes were assumed to be a consequence of changes in surface topography in the nanoscale. A simple method of a quantitative description of the change of the topography of these films was developed. Critical dimensions of these films were determined in horizontal and vertical directions relative to the surface plane. The slope coefficient (SC) describing how sharp the structures are, is defined as the ratio between the critical dimensions: the root-mean-square roughness σ and the autocorrelation length ξ. For SC > 0.08, the contact angle increased proportionally to the value of SC, whereas for SC < 0.08, the contact angle proportionally decreased. At the highest SC values, the contact angles were 6-10% higher than those predicted for flat porous surfaces using the Cassie-Baxter equation. We suggest that this discrepancy is due to the capillary tension caused by the submicron-scale undulation of the triple line, which was found to be proportional to the height of the crownlike pore edges and the value of SC. The same effect is responsible for the linear dependence of the contact angle on the SC value.",Characterization of a Carbon Monoxide-Activated Soluble Guanylate Cyclase from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30946781,Biochemistry,2019 04 30,"Signaling pathways that involve diatomic gases in photosynthetic organisms are not well understood. Exposure to nitric oxide or carbon monoxide is known to elicit certain responses in some photosynthetic organisms. For example, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii grown in low-iron media responds to exogenous carbon monoxide by increasing cell growth and intracellular chlorophyll levels. Here, we characterize Cyg11, a gas-responsive soluble guanylate cyclase from the eukaryotic green alga C. reinhardtii that converts GTP to cGMP. Cyg11 transcription is upregulated when C. reinhardtii is grown in iron-limited media, suggesting its importance in nutrient-limited environments. Cyg11 is purified as a homodimer and is activated by nitric oxide (2.5-fold over basal activity) and carbon monoxide (6.3-fold). The heme binding stoichiometry of Cyg11 was found to be one heme per homodimer, an unexpected result based on the sequence and oligomerization state of the enzyme. Gas binding properties, the kinetics of gas binding, and the ligand-modulated activity of Cyg11 are consistent with CO as the relevant physiological ligand.",From Oxygen to Sulfur and Back: Difluoro -H-phosphinothioates as a Turning Point in the Preparation of Difluorinated Phosphinates: Application to the Synthesis of Modified Dinucleotides.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30946780,The Journal of organic chemistry,2019 05 04,"A simple, two-step procedure to convert α,α-difluorinated H-phosphinic acids into the corresponding H-phosphinothioates is described. The usefulness of these species is demonstrated by their transformation into difluorinated phosphinothioyl radicals and their addition onto alkenes. Additionally, sequential treatment of H-phosphinothioates by a strong base and a primary alkyl iodide constitutes an alternate route to the formation of the C-P bond. Both methods efficiently deliver difluorinated phosphinothioates. Similar reactions carried out with the fully oxygenated counterparts clearly indicate the superiority of the sulfur-based species and emphasize the crucial role played by sulfur in the construction of the second C-P bond. Oxidation easily transforms the thereby obtained phosphinothioates into the corresponding phosphinates.

We examined the predictability of the formation of co-amorphous systems and identified two reliable indicators of successful formation: (1) a negative Δ Hmix value and (2) small Δlog P between components. Moreover, we found that the stability of co-amorphous systems was improved when (1) Δ Hmix was negative and (2) amorphous forms of the constituent compounds were stable. Furthermore, we concluded that co-amorphous systems with small (negatively large) Δ Hmix values had lower hygroscopicity. Typically, amorphous solid dispersions exhibit hygroscopicity because polymers exhibit large hygroscopicity. We proved the superiority of co-amorphous technology over amorphous solid dispersion in this respect. Our results provide methods for (1) establishing a screening method and (2) improving hygroscopicity, which may make co-amorphous technology more useful than amorphous solid dispersion technology.",Actin-binding domains mediate the distinct distribution of two Dictyostelium Talins through different affinities to specific subsets of actin filaments during directed cell migration.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30946777,PloS one,2019 04 21,"Although the distinct distribution of certain molecules along the anterior or posterior edge is essential for directed cell migration, the mechanisms to maintain asymmetric protein localization have not yet been fully elucidated. Here, we studied a mechanism for the distinct localizations of two Dictyostelium talin homologues, talin A and talin B, both of which play important roles in cell migration and adhesion. Using GFP fusion, we found that talin B, as well as its C-terminal actin-binding region, which consists of an I/LWEQ domain and a villin headpiece domain, was restricted to the leading edge of migrating cells. This is in sharp contrast to talin A and its C-terminal actin-binding domain, which co-localized with myosin II along the cell posterior cortex, as reported previously. Intriguingly, even in myosin II-null cells, talin A and its actin-binding domain displayed a specific distribution, co-localizing with stretched actin filaments. In contrast, talin B was excluded from regions rich in stretched actin filaments, although a certain amount of its actin-binding region alone was present in those areas. When cells were sucked by a micro-pipette, talin B was not detected in the retracting aspirated lobe where acto-myosin, talin A, and the actin-binding regions of talin A and talin B accumulated. Based on these results, we suggest that talin A predominantly interacts with actin filaments stretched by myosin II through its C-terminal actin-binding region, while the actin-binding region of talin B does not make such distinctions. Furthermore, talin B appears to have an additional, unidentified mechanism that excludes it from the region rich in stretched actin filaments. We propose that these actin-binding properties play important roles in the anterior and posterior enrichment of talin B and talin A, respectively, during directed cell migration.",Real-world effectiveness and safety of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir and ledipasvir/sofosbuvir hepatitis C treatment in a single centre in Germany.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30946776,PloS one,2019 04 21,"Newer direct-acting antiviral therapies are increasingly becoming the therapy of choice in patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection.

Here we demonstrate a rapid form of habituation of the C-start to touch that resembles the previously reported rapid habituation induced by auditory or vibrational stimuli. We also show that touch-induced habituation exhibits input specificity. This work sets the stage for in vivo optical investigations of the cellular sites of plasticity that mediate habituation of the C-start in the larval zebrafish.","Group B streptococcal screening, intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis, and neonatal early-onset infection rates in an Australian local health district: 2006-2016.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30946761,PloS one,2019 04 21,"Intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP) to reduce the likelihood of neonatal early-onset group B streptococcal infection (EOGBS) has coincided with major reductions in incidence.

Both methods have limitations: WGBS is expensive and prohibitive for most large-scale projects; RRBS only interrogates 6-12% of the CpGs in the human genome. Here, we introduce methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme bisulfite sequencing (MREBS) which has the reduced sequencing requirements of RRBS, but significantly expands the coverage of CpG sites in the genome. We built a multiple regression model that combines the two features of MREBS: the bisulfite conversion ratios of single cytosines (as in WGBS and RRBS) as well as the number of reads that cover each locus (as in MRE-seq). This combined approach allowed us to estimate differential methylation across 60% of the genome using read count data alone, and where counts were sufficiently high in both samples (about 1.5% of the genome), our estimates were significantly improved by the single CpG conversion information. We show that differential DNA methylation values based on MREBS data correlate well with those based on WGBS and RRBS. This newly developed technique combines the sequencing cost of RRBS and DNA methylation estimates on a portion of the genome similar to WGBS, making it ideal for large-scale projects of mammalian genomes.",Fasting breath H2 and gut microbiota metabolic potential are associated with the response to a fermented milk product in irritable bowel syndrome.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30946757,PloS one,2019 04 21,Aim of this study was to assess the effect of a fermented milk product containing Bifidobacterium lactis CNCM I-2494 (FMP) on gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms and exhaled H2 and CH4 during a nutrient and lactulose challenge in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).,A survey of Onchocerca fasciata infection in camels (Camelus bactrianus) with notes on morphology.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30946756,PloS one,2019 04 21,"The goal of this study was to provide insight into the pathogenicity of Onchocerca fasciata in Camelus bactrianus to help control onchocerciasis. From November 2015 to January 2016, the prevalence and severity of onchocerciasis were recorded in 152 camels. Nodules containing Onchocerca were collected and observed. Adult parasites were extracted from the nodules and identified via light microscopy as well as by partial sequencing of the cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) gene. The sequences were examined and compared to similar sequences from other Onchocerca species. In total, 80.3% of camels were parasitized. The severity of infection varied, as camels harboured between one and fifteen nodules. The morphology and the cuticle differed in both sexes and displayed considerable variation in the thickness and structure of different body parts. Identification was further confirmed using molecular biology methods. This study provides a comprehensive morphological description of Onchocerca fasciata isolated from camels. The prevalence and intensity of infection (assessed via nodules) varied in the Bactrian camels. The structure of the cuticle was an important morphological feature for species differentiation in Onchocerca.

In contrast to most S. cerevisiae and Frohberg-type S. pastorianus strains, S. eubayanus cannot utilize the α-tri-glucoside maltotriose, a major carbohydrate in brewer's wort. In Saccharomyces yeasts, utilization of maltotriose is encoded by the subtelomeric MAL gene family, and requires transporters for maltotriose uptake. While S. eubayanus strain CBS 12357T harbors four SeMALT genes which enable uptake of the α-di-glucoside maltose, it lacks maltotriose transporter genes. In S. cerevisiae, sequence identity indicates that maltotriose and maltose transporters likely evolved from a shared ancestral gene. To study the evolvability of maltotriose utilization in S. eubayanus CBS 12357T, maltotriose-assimilating mutants obtained after UV mutagenesis were subjected to laboratory evolution in carbon-limited chemostat cultures on maltotriose-enriched wort. An evolved strain showed improved maltose and maltotriose fermentation in 7 L fermenter experiments on industrial wort. Whole-genome sequencing revealed a novel mosaic SeMALT413 gene, resulting from repeated gene introgressions by non-reciprocal translocation of at least three SeMALT genes. The predicted tertiary structure of SeMalT413 was comparable to the original SeMalT transporters, but overexpression of SeMALT413 sufficed to enable growth on maltotriose, indicating gene neofunctionalization had occurred. The mosaic structure of SeMALT413 resembles the structure of S. pastorianus maltotriose-transporter gene SpMTY1, which has high sequences identity to alternatingly S. cerevisiae MALx1, S. paradoxus MALx1 and S. eubayanus SeMALT3. Evolution of the maltotriose transporter landscape in hybrid S. pastorianus lager-brewing strains is therefore likely to have involved mechanisms similar to those observed in the present study.",Evolution of a novel chimeric maltotriose transporter in Saccharomyces eubayanus from parent proteins unable to perform this function.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30946740,PLoS genetics,2019 05 08,"At the molecular level, the evolution of new traits can be broadly divided between changes in gene expression and changes in protein-coding sequence. For proteins, the evolution of novel functions is generally thought to proceed through sequential point mutations or recombination of whole functional units. In Saccharomyces, the uptake of the sugar maltotriose into the cell is the primary limiting factor in its utilization, but maltotriose transporters are relatively rare, except in brewing strains. No known wild strains of Saccharomyces eubayanus, the cold-tolerant parent of hybrid lager-brewing yeasts (Saccharomyces cerevisiae x S. eubayanus), are able to consume maltotriose, which limits their ability to fully ferment malt extract. In one strain of S. eubayanus, we found a gene closely related to a known maltotriose transporter and were able to confer maltotriose consumption by overexpressing this gene or by passaging the strain on maltose. Even so, most wild strains of S. eubayanus lack native maltotriose transporters. To determine how this rare trait could evolve in naive genetic backgrounds, we performed an adaptive evolution experiment for maltotriose consumption, which yielded a single strain of S. eubayanus able to grow on maltotriose. We mapped the causative locus to a gene encoding a novel chimeric transporter that was formed by an ectopic recombination event between two genes encoding transporters that are unable to import maltotriose. In contrast to classic models of the evolution of novel protein functions, the recombination breakpoints occurred within a single functional domain. Thus, the ability of the new protein to carry maltotriose was likely acquired through epistatic interactions between independently evolved substitutions. By acquiring multiple mutations at once, the transporter rapidly gained a novel function, while bypassing potentially deleterious intermediate steps. This study provides an illuminating example of how recombination between paralogs can establish novel interactions among substitutions to create adaptive functions.",Genome-wide association study reveals sex-specific genetic architecture of facial attractiveness.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30946739,PLoS genetics,2019 05 08,"Facial attractiveness is a complex human trait of great interest in both academia and industry. Literature on sociological and phenotypic factors associated with facial attractiveness is rich, but its genetic basis is poorly understood. In this paper, we conducted a genome-wide association study to discover genetic variants associated with facial attractiveness using 4,383 samples in the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study. We identified two genome-wide significant loci, highlighted a handful of candidate genes, and demonstrated enrichment for heritability in human tissues involved in reproduction and hormone synthesis. Additionally, facial attractiveness showed strong and negative genetic correlations with BMI in females and with blood lipids in males. Our analysis also suggested sex-specific selection pressure on variants associated with lower male attractiveness. These results revealed sex-specific genetic architecture of facial attractiveness and provided fundamental new insights into its genetic basis.","Outbreak of Cyanide Poisoning Caused by Consumption of Cassava Flour - Kasese District, Uganda, September 2017.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30946738,MMWR.

Morbidity and mortality weekly report,2019 04 05,"When the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) began in 1988, cases of poliomyelitis were reported from 125 countries. Since then, only Afghanistan, Nigeria, and Pakistan have experienced uninterrupted transmission of wild poliovirus (WPV). The primary means of detecting poliovirus is through surveillance for acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) among children aged <15 years with testing of stool specimens for WPV and vaccine-derived polioviruses (VDPVs) in World Health Organization (WHO)-accredited laboratories of the Global Polio Laboratory Network (GPLN) (1,2). AFP surveillance is supplemented by environmental surveillance for polioviruses in sewage at selected locations. Analysis of genomic sequences of isolated polioviruses enables assessment of transmission by time and place, potential gaps in surveillance, and emergence of VDPVs (3). This report presents 2017-2018 poliovirus surveillance data, focusing on 31 countries* identified as high-priority countries because of a ""high risk of poliovirus transmission and limited capacity to adequately address those risks"" (4). Some of these countries are located within WHO regions with endemic polio, and others are in regions that are polio-free. In 2018, 26 (84%) of the 31 countries met AFP surveillance indicators nationally; however, subnational variation in surveillance performance was substantial. Surveillance systems need continued strengthening through monitoring, supervision, and improvements in specimen collection and transport to provide sufficient evidence for interruption of poliovirus circulation.","Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Prevalence Among Adults Who Have Never Smoked, by Industry and Occupation - United States, 2013-2017.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30946736,MMWR.

However, an estimated 24% of adults with COPD have never smoked (3,4). Among these persons, 26%-53% of COPD can be attributed to workplace exposures, including dust, fumes, gases, vapors, and secondhand smoke exposure (4-6). To assess industry-specific and occupation-specific COPD prevalence among adults aged ≥18 years who have never smoked and who were employed any time during the past 12 months, CDC analyzed 2013-2017 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) data. Among an estimated 106 million workers who had never smoked, 2.2% (2.4 million) have COPD. Highest prevalences were among workers aged ≥65 years (4.6%), women (3.0%), and those reporting fair/poor health (6.7%). Among industries and occupations, the highest COPD prevalences were among workers in the information industry (3.3%) and office and administrative support occupations (3.3%). Among women, the highest prevalences were among those employed in the information industry (5.1%) and in the transportation and material moving occupation (4.5%), and among men, among those employed in the agriculture, forestry, fishing, and hunting industry (2.3%) and the administrative and support, waste management, and remediation services industry (2.3%). High COPD prevalences in certain industries and occupations among persons who have never smoked underscore the importance of continued surveillance, early identification of COPD, and reduction or elimination of COPD-associated risk factors, such as the reduction of workplace exposures to dust, vapors, fumes, chemicals, and exposure to indoor and outdoor air pollutants.","Nonfatal Assaults and Homicides Among Adults Aged ≥60 Years - United States, 2002-2016.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30946734,MMWR.

A robot-assisted surgical system was used in 30 patients for pedicle screw placement. The other 30 patients underwent fluoroscopy-guided percutaneous pedicle screw placement. RESULTS There were 130 screws placed under fluoroscopic guidance, with 26.2% penetration of the pedicle wall. There were 130 screws placed in robotic-assisted surgery, with 6.2% penetration of the pedicle wall. Severe screw deviation (Neo grade III) was identified in 4 screws in the fluoroscopy-guided group, while no severe deviation was noted in the robot-assisted group. In the fluoroscopic group, 15.6% of screws penetrated the superior articular process, and 2.1% screws had severe complications (Babu grade III). However, only 5.1% of screws in the robot-assisted group had severe complications. The mean screw insertion angle was significantly greater in the robot-assisted group than in the fluoroscopy-guided group (23.8±6.1° vs. 18.4±7.2°, P=0.017). CONCLUSIONS Compared to fluoroscopy-guided percutaneous pedicle screw placement, robot-assisted percutaneous pedicle screw placement has the following advantages: greater accuracy, lower incidences of screw penetration of the pedicle wall and invasion of the facet joints, and better screw insertion angle. Combined with MIS-TLIF, robot-assisted percutaneous pedicle screw placement is an effective minimally invasive treatment for lumbar spondylolisthesis.",Correlation of anxiety and chronic pain to grade of synovitis in patients with knee osteoarthritis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30946731,Psychiatria Danubina,2019 04 04,"This study was conducted with the objective of finding out the correlation between synovial inflammation measured histopathologically and subjective symptoms; anxiety and chronic pain, in knee osteoarthritis (OA).",Quality of life and health of patients in early stages of Multiple sclerosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30946730,Psychiatria Danubina,2019 04 04,"Multiple sclerosis is a chronic neurologic condition with a variety of symptoms which have a great impact on quality of life even in the early stages.

However, majority of adverse outcomes of anaphylaxis during pregnancy frequently affect the neonates rather than the mothers. The negative neurologic outcomes of the fetus are mostly due to delayed caesarean delivery or inadequate doses of adrenaline during anaphylaxis.

In many cases, an allergic mechanism cannot be ruled out and systematic investigations should be tested of all drugs and agents the patient was exposed to prior to the reaction. The complexity of agents used for anaesthesia and surgery present challenges when attempting to identify the culprit drugs and select proper testing to better recognition of trigger. The diagnosis of preoperative anaphylactic or anaphylactoid reaction is clinical and based upon the presence of characteristic symptom and signs that begin suddenly and developed rapidly in most cases. Elevations of mast cell mediators such as tryptase and histamine in the blood can help to distinguish anaphylaxis from other disorders that present with similar clinical picture. The secondary investigations of adverse perioperative drug reactions are highly specialised and include skin testing, in vitro testing and in some cases challenge tests. Any suspected reaction during anaesthesia must be extensively investigated and these diagnostic tests should be done in specialised centres. The cooperation between anaesthesiologists and allergists is necessary to provide the necessary diagnostic tests to identify the responsible drug, to carry out prevention and to provide recommendations for future anesthetic procedures.",Complication and prognosis of juvenile idiopathic arthritis associated uveitis in the era of modern immunomodulatory treatment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30946717,Psychiatria Danubina,2019 04 04,"JIA is the most common rheumatic disease of childhood and JIA-U is its most frequent and most devastating extraarticular manifestation.

Thus, screening for JIA-U in all JIA patients and early treatment is of prime importance. Over the last 15-20 years, ever since IMT has been used, studies generally show trends toward decrease of JIA-U onset, complications frequency, improvement of prognosis and remission achievement. Despite evident improvements, over 20% JIA-U patients still develop complications in long-term follow-up. Moreover, about 50% JIA-U patients continue to have active uveitis in adulthood. Therefore, JIA-U is still associated with high risk of late sequelae and visual acuity loss, functionally and structurally eye damage and quality of life impairment.",Health Sequelae of Tobacco Exposure in Childhood and Adolescence.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30946716,Psychiatria Danubina,2019 04 04,"Tobacco consumption is one of the most common preventable cause of premature deaths worldwide.

Understanding of physiology and pathophysiology requires integration of both clinical and basic factual knowledge and regulatory homeodynamic concepts.

Matrix led algorhythmic analysis and re-synthesis puts together patients' clinical data along with a broad academic knowledge which may be relevant to it. Graphic representation enables outlining a multiple interconnections among etiopathogenetic components within the human body. The etiopathogenetic clusters (EPCs) are crossing points, the integrative hubs of disease pathways. Multiple diseases of triggered by independent etiologies often converge to a common EPC, and thus contributing to natural networking of physiological processes in health and diseases. Contemporary biomedical sciences have been daily producing copious amounts of data whose participation in integrative physiology is yet to be explored within the whole body reactivity. Graphic representation and active composition of pathophysiological processes stimulates a synthetic reasoning as a subroutine intellectual habit, critically relevant to both physicians and biomedical researchers.

Its osteogenic and bone regenerative abilities are well studied, but much is unknown about the periosteum. In this study, we found that macrophage-lineage cells recruit periosteum-derived cells (PDCs) for cortical bone formation. Knockout of colony stimulating factor-1 eliminated macrophage-lineage cells and resulted in loss of PDCs with impaired periosteal bone formation. Moreover, macrophage-lineage TRAP+ cells induced transcriptional expression of periostin and recruitment of PDCs to the periosteal surface through secretion of platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB), where the recruited PDCs underwent osteoblast differentiation coupled with type H vessel formation. We also found that subsets of Nestin+ and LepR+ PDCs possess multipotent and self-renewal abilities and contribute to cortical bone formation. Nestin+ PDCs are found primarily during bone development, whereas LepR+ PDCs are essential for bone homeostasis in adult mice. Importantly, conditional knockout of Pdgfrβ (platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta) in LepR+ cells impaired periosteal bone formation and regeneration. These findings uncover the essential role of periosteal macrophage-lineage cells in regulating periosteum homeostasis and regeneration.",Elevation of circular RNA circ_0005230 facilitates cell growth and metastasis via sponging miR-1238 and miR-1299 in cholangiocarcinoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30946694,Aging,2019 05 19,"Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is a highly malignant carcinoma with high mortality rate worldwide. Emerging evidence indicates that aberrantly expressed circular RNAs (circRNAs) functions crucial roles in tumor progression. In this work, we focused on a novel circRNA, circ_0005230, in carcinogenesis and development of CCA. Circ_0005230 levels in CCA specimens and cells were measured by qRT-PCR. The clinical implication of circ_0005230 was analyzed by fisher's exact test. Gain/loss of-function assays were conducted to reveal the effects of circ_0005230 on the cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion of CCA cells. Xenograft and lung metastatic models were constructed to confirm the in vitro data. Dual luciferase reporter and rescue assays were carried out to illuminate the mechanism behind the regulatory actions. As data showed, circ_0005230 was elevated in tumors and CCA cells. Its expression in tumor samples was related to clinical severity. Functionally, circ_0005230 significantly facilitated cell growth, clone-forming ability and metastatic properties and inhibit cell apoptosis in CCA cells. The in vivo study further validated the in vitro results. However, knockdown of circ_0005230 did not affect normal biliary epithelial (HIBEC) cell growth and apoptosis.

Using data from the Medical Panel Expenditure Survey, I exploit the discontinuity in health insurance coverage rates at age 26, the new dependent coverage age cutoff enforced by the ACA. Under alternative regression discontinuity design models, I find that 2.5 to 5.3 percent of young adults lose their health insurance coverage once they turn 26. This effect is mainly driven by those who lose their private health insurance plan coverage and those who lose their health insurance plan coverage, whose main holder resides outside of the household. I also find that the discrete change in health insurance coverage rates at age 26 is associated with up to a 3.6 percentage point decrease in office-based physician and and up to a 2.1 percentage point decrease in dental visits, but does not have a significant impact on the utilization of outpatient or emergency department services. Furthermore, the effects of the ACA's dependent coverage mandate on health care spending and out-of-pocket costs are insignificant. These results are robust under alternative model specifications.","Consumer-Mediated Data Exchange for Research: Current State of US Law, Technology, and Trust.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30946692,JMIR medical informatics,2019 06 04,"A compendium of US laws and regulations offers increasingly strong support for the concept that researchers can acquire the electronic health record data that their studies need directly from the study participants using technologies and processes called consumer-mediated data exchange. This data acquisition method is particularly valuable for studies that need complete longitudinal electronic records for all their study participants who individually and collectively receive care from multiple providers in the United States. In such studies, it is logistically infeasible for the researcher to receive necessary data directly from each provider, including providers who may not have the capability, capacity, or interest in supporting research. This paper is a tutorial to inform the researcher who faces these data acquisition challenges about the opportunities offered by consumer-mediated data exchange. It outlines 2 approaches and reviews the current state of provider- and consumer-facing technologies that are necessary to support each approach. For one approach, the technology is developed and estimated to be widely available but could raise trust concerns among research organizations or their institutional review boards because of the current state of US law applicable to consumer-facing technologies. For the other approach, which does not elicit the same trust concerns, the necessary technology is emerging and a pilot is underway. After reading this paper, the researcher who has not been following these developments should have a good understanding of the legal, regulatory, technology, and trust issues surrounding consumer-mediated data exchange for research, with an awareness of what is potentially possible now, what is not possible now, and what could change in the future. The researcher interested in trying consumer-mediated data exchange will also be able to anticipate and respond to an anticipated barrier: the trust concerns that their own organizations could raise.",Dimensionality Reduction of Hyperspectral Imagery Based on Spatial-Spectral Manifold Learning.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30946691,IEEE transactions on cybernetics,2019 04 04,"The graph embedding (GE) methods have been widely applied for dimensionality reduction of hyperspectral imagery (HSI). However, a major challenge of GE is how to choose the proper neighbors for graph construction and explore the spatial information of HSI data. In this paper, we proposed an unsupervised dimensionality reduction algorithm called spatial-spectral manifold reconstruction preserving embedding (SSMRPE) for HSI classification. At first, a weighted mean filter (WMF) is employed to preprocess the image, which aims to reduce the influence of background noise. According to the spatial consistency property of HSI, SSMRPE utilizes a new spatial-spectral combined distance (SSCD) to fuse the spatial structure and spectral information for selecting effective spatial-spectral neighbors of HSI pixels. Then, it explores the spatial relationship between each point and its neighbors to adjust the reconstruction weights to improve the efficiency of manifold reconstruction. As a result, the proposed method can extract the discriminant features and subsequently improve the classification performance of HSI. The experimental results on the PaviaU and Salinas hyperspectral data sets indicate that SSMRPE can achieve better classification results in comparison with some state-of-the-art methods.","Object Activity Scene Description, Construction, and Recognition.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30946690,IEEE transactions on cybernetics,2019 04 04,"Action recognition is a critical task for social robots to meaningfully engage with their environment. 3-D human skeleton-based action recognition has been an attractive research area in recent years. Although the existing approaches are good at action recognition, it is a great challenge to recognize a group of actions in an activity scene. To tackle this problem, at first, we partition the scene into several primitive actions (PAs)-based upon motion attention mechanism. Then, the PAs are described by the trajectory vectors of the corresponding joints. After that, motivated by text classification based on word embedding, we employ a convolutional neural network (CNN) to recognize activity scenes by considering motion of joints as ``word'' of activity. The experimental results on the dataset of human activity scenes show the efficiency of the proposed approach."

Moreover, we provide rigorous Lyapunov-based proofs for the stability of the equilibrium point, which results in asymptotic convergence properties. A terminal state evaluation procedure is introduced to facilitate the online implementation.

It is a challenge to develop multi-finger force feedback gloves with light weight. In this paper, we propose a solution using layer jamming sheet (LJS) on each finger joint. In simulating free space, the LJS is soft and easy to deform, which allows the finger joints to move freely with a small resistance force. In simulating constrained space, the LJS becomes stiff, which provides resistance torques to prevent rotation of finger joints. Possible solutions for mounting the LJS on finger joints are investigated. Mechanical models of the LJS are derived by quantifying the relationship between the bending stiffness and the pressure, material and geometry of the layer. Experiments are performed to characterize the mechanical behavior of the LJS actuator and to validate the performance of the different design solutions in simulating free space and constrained space. Experimental results indicate the potential of the proposed joint-based LJS-actuated approach for developing light weighted force feedback gloves.","Haptic Telerobotic Cardiovascular Intervention: a Review of Approaches, Methods, and Future Perspectives.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30946677,IEEE reviews in biomedical engineering,2019 04 05,"Cardiac diseases are recognized as the leading cause of mortality, hospitalization, and medical prescription globally. The gold standard for the treatment of coronary artery stenosis is the percutaneous cardiac intervention which is performed under live X-ray imaging.

Telerobotic vascular intervention systems with a master-slave architecture reduced the X-ray exposure and enhanced the clinical outcomes; however, the loss of haptic feedback during surgery has been the main limitation of such systems. This study is a review of the state-of-the-art for haptic telerobotic cardiovascular interventions. A survey on the literature published between 2000 to 2019 was performed. Results of the survey were screened based on their relevance to this work. Also, the leading research disciplines were identified based on the results of the survey.

Our sensing system primarily detects the periodic movements of the human lungs and the hearts via the impedance variation of the resonator. With a change in impedance, both the VCO oscillation frequency and the PLL feedback voltage also change. Thus, by tracking the feedback voltage of the PLL, breath and heart rate signals can be acquired simultaneously. However, as the distance between the body and the sensor varies, there are certain points with minimal sensitivity, making it is quite difficult to detect vital signs. These points, called impedance null points, periodically occur at distances proportional to the wavelength. To overcome the impedance null point problem, two resonators operating at different frequencies, 2.40 and 2.76 GHz, are employed as receiving components. In an experiment to investigate the sensing performance as a function of distance, the measurement distance was accurately controlled by a linear actuator. Furthermore, to evaluate the sensing performance in a real environment, experiments were carried out with a male and a female subject in a static vehicle. To demonstrate the real-time vital sign monitoring capability, spectrograms were utilized, and the accuracy was assessed relative to reference sensors. Based on the results, it is demonstrated that the proposed remote sensor can reliably detect vital signs in a real vehicle environment.",Seq2seq Fingerprint with Byte-Pair Encoding for Predicting Changes in Protein Stability upon Single Point Mutation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30946675,IEEE/ACM transactions on computational biology and bioinformatics,2019 04 04,"Engineering stable proteins is crucial to various industrial purposes. Several machine learning methods have been developed to predict changes in the stability of proteins upon single point mutations. To improve accuracy of the prediction, we propose a new unsupervised descriptor for protein sequences that is based on a sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) neural network model combined with a sequence-compression method called byte-pair encoding (BPE). Our results exhibit that BPE can encode a protein sequence into a sequence of shorter length, thereby enabling efficient training of the seq2seq model.

In recent years, deep learning methods have achieved significant success in CNER tasks. However, these methods depend greatly on recurrent neural networks (RNNs), which maintain a vector of hidden activations that are propagated through time, thus causing too much time to train models. In this paper, we propose a residual dilated convolutional neural network with conditional random field (RD-CNN-CRF) for the Chinese CNER, which makes the model asynchronous in computation and thus speeding up the training period dramatically. To be more specific, Chinese characters and dictionary features are first projected into dense vector representations, then they are fed into the residual dilated convolutional neural network to capture contextual features. Finally, a conditional random field is employed to capture dependencies between neighboring tags and obtain the optimal tag sequence for the entire sequence. Computational results on the CCKS-2017 Task 2 benchmark dataset show that our proposed RD-CNN-CRF method competes favorably with state-of-the-art RNN-based methods both in terms of computational performance and training time.",Cloning the λ Switch: Digital and Markov Representations of the Lambda Phage Infected E. coli Bacterium.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30946673,IEEE transactions on nanobioscience,2019 04 05,"The lysis-lysogeny switch in E. coli due to infection from lambda phage has been extensively studied and explained by scientists of molecular biology. The bacterium either survives with the viral strand of Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), or dies producing hundreds of viruses for propagation of infection. Many proteins transcribed after infection by λ phage take part in determining the fate of the bacterium, but two proteins that play a key role in this regard are the cI and cro dimers, that are transcribed off the viral DNA. This paper presents a novel modeling mechanism for the lysis-lysogeny switch, by transferring the interactions of the main proteins, the lambda right operator and promoter regions and the Ribonucleic acid (RNA) polymerase, to a finite state machine (FSM), to determine cell fate. The FSM thus derived is implemented in field-programmable gate array (FPGA) and simulations have been run in random conditions. A Markov model has been created for the same mechanism. Steady state analysis has been conducted for the transition matrix of the Markov model and results have been generated to show the steady state probability of lysis with various model values.

However, most of state-of-the-art long-read based SV detection approaches are in generic design to detect various kinds of SVs, and they are either not suited to detect NSIs or computationally expensive. Herein, we propose Read Clustering and Assembly-based Novel Insertion Detection tool (rCANID). It applies tailored chimerically aligned and unaligned read clustering and lightweight local assembly methods to reconstruct inserted sequences with low computational cost. Benchmarks on both simulated and real datasets demonstrate that rCANID can discover NSIs sensitively and efficiently, especially for NSI events with long inserted sequences which is still a non-trivial task for state-of-the-art approaches.

This paper examined the longitudinal changes in band-limited resting-state (RS) functional connectivity (FC) networks in association with post-stroke UL functional recovery achieved by a multimodal intervention involving motor attempt (MA)-based BMI and robotic hand-exoskeleton. Four adults were rehabilitated with the intervention for a period lasting up to six weeks. RS magnetoencephalography (MEG) signals, Action Research Arm Test (ARAT), and grip strength (GS) measures were recorded at five equispaced sessions over the intervention period. An average post-interventional increase of 100.0% (p=0.00028) and 88.0% was attained for ARAT and GS, respectively. A cluster-based statistical test involving correlation estimates between beta-band (15-26 Hz) RS-MEG FCs and UL functional recovery provided the positively correlated sub-networks in both the contralesional and ipsilesional motor cortices. The frontoparietal FC exhibited hemispheric lateralization wherein the majority of the positively and negatively correlated connections were found in contralesional and ipsilesional hemispheres, respectively.

Given a grayscale target image, we first select a color source image containing similar segments to target image and extract multi-level features of each superpixel in both images after superpixel segmentation. Then a set of color candidates for each target superpixel is selected by adopting a top-down feature matching scheme with confidence assignment. Finally, we propose a variational approach to determine the most appropriate color for each target superpixel from color candidates. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method and show its superiority to other state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, our method can be easily extended to color transfer between two color images."

Occlusion in OST-HMDs is a powerful visual cue that enables depth perception in augmented reality (AR). Without occlusion, virtual objects rendered by an OST-HMD appear semi-transparent and less realistic. A common occlusion technique is to use spatial light modulators (SLMs) to block incoming light rays at each pixel on the SLM selectively. However, most of the existing methods create an occlusion mask only at a single, fixed depth-typically at infinity. With recent advances in varifocal OST-HMDs, such traditional fixed-focus occlusion causes a mismatch in depth between the occlusion mask plane and the virtual object to be occluded, leading to an uncomfortable user experience with blurred occlusion masks. In this paper, we thus propose an OST-HMD system with varifocal occlusion capability: we physically slide a transmissive liquid crystal display (LCD) to optically shift the occlusion plane along the optical path so that the mask appears sharp and aligns to a virtual image at a given depth. Our solution has several benefits over existing varifocal occlusion methods: it is computationally less demanding and, more importantly, it is optically consistent, i.e., when a user loses focus on the corresponding virtual image, the mask again gets blurred consistently as the virtual image does. In the experiment, we build a proof-of-concept varifocal occlusion system implemented with a custom retinal projection display and demonstrate that the system can shift the occlusion plane to depths ranging from 25 cm to infinity.",Light Attenuation Display: Subtractive See-Through Near-Eye Display via Spatial Color Filtering.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30946657,IEEE transactions on visualization and computer graphics,2019 04 04,"We present a display for optical see-through near-eye displays based on light attenuation, a new paradigm that forms images by spatially subtracting colors of light. Existing optical see-through head-mounted displays (OST-HMDs) form virtual images in an additive manner-they optically combine the light from an embedded light source such as a microdisplay into the users' field of view (FoV). Instead, our light attenuation display filters the color of the real background light pixel-wise in the users' see-through view, resulting in an image as a spatial color filter. Our image formation is complementary to existing light-additive OST-HMDs. The core optical component in our system is a phase-only spatial light modulator (PSLM), a liquid crystal module that can control the phase of the light in each pixel. By combining PSLMs with polarization optics, our system realizes a spatially programmable color filter. In this paper, we introduce our optics design, evaluate the spatial color filter, consider applications including image rendering and FoV color control, and discuss the limitations of the current prototype.",Embedding Psychiatric Risk Flags Within an Electronic Health Record: Initial Findings and Lessons Learned.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30946656,"Healthcare quarterly (Toronto, Ont.)",2019 04 04,"In an effort to improve safety in psychiatric settings, health professionals need to be aware of patients at risk for aggression and violent behaviour.

Many hospitals, challenged with increasing demand and limited resources, have tried to find efficiencies within their operations. One such strategy is that of early morning discharges and expedited bed turnaround times. We conducted a retrospective study within three high-volume hospitals in the Greater Toronto Area looking at discharge times of in-patients and transfer times of admitted, Emergency Department (ED)-boarded patients.

Sixteen SCNs have been implemented, and all are constituted as teams of healthcare professionals, researchers, government stakeholders, patients and families seeking to improve delivery of healthcare across the province. SCNs were developed in part as a strategy for strengthening clinical engagement to achieve a broad range of healthcare delivery benefits including improvement of clinical care processes and reduced variations in practice, better access to care and improved patient outcomes across the province.

However, the potential involvement of proteolytic system macroautophagy/autophagy in this wasting process remains elusive. Autophagy is precisely regulated to maintain cell survival and homeostasis; thus its dysregulation (i.e., overactivation or persistent suppression) could lead to detrimental outcomes in skeletal muscle. Here we show that infusion of ANG II for 7 days in male FVB mice suppressed autophagy in skeletal muscle. ANG II blunted microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3B (LC3B)-I-to-LC3B-II conversion (an autophagosome marker), increased p62/SQSTM1 (an autophagy cargo receptor) protein expression, and decreased the number of autophagic vacuoles. ANG II inhibited UNC-51-like kinase 1 via inhibition of 5'-AMP-activated kinase and activation of mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1, leading to reduced phosphorylation of beclin-1Ser14 and Autophagy-related protein 14Ser29, suggesting that ANG II impairs autophagosome formation in skeletal muscle. In line with ANG II-mediated suppression of autophagy, ANG II promoted accumulation of abnormal/damaged mitochondria, characterized by swelling and disorganized cristae and matrix dissolution, with associated increase in PTEN-induced kinase 1 protein expression. ANG II also reduced mitochondrial respiration, indicative of mitochondrial dysfunction. Together, these results demonstrate that ANG II reduces autophagic activity and disrupts mitochondrial ultrastructure and function, likely contributing to skeletal muscle wasting. Therefore, strategies that activate autophagy in skeletal muscle have the potential to prevent or blunt ANG II-induced skeletal muscle wasting in chronic diseases. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Our study identified a novel mechanism whereby angiotensin II (ANG II) impairs mitochondrial energy metabolism in skeletal muscle. ANG II suppressed autophagosome formation by inhibiting the UNC-51-like kinase 1(ULK1)-beclin-1 axis, resulting in accumulation of abnormal/damaged and dysfunctional mitochondria and reduced mitochondrial respiratory capacity. Therapeutic strategies that activate the ULK1-beclin-1 axis have the potential to delay or reverse skeletal muscle wasting in chronic diseases characterized by increased systemic ANG II levels.","Mechanical properties, physiological behavior, and function of aponeurosis and tendon.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30946635,"Journal of applied physiology (Bethesda, Md. : 1985)",2019 06 10,"During human movement, the muscle and tendinous structures interact as a mechanical system in which forces are generated and transmitted to the bone and energy is stored and released to optimize function and economy of movement and/or to reduce risk of injury.

The force-bearing tissues are examined from a structural macroscopic point of view down to the nanoscale level of the collagen fibril. In recent years, the understanding of in vivo mechanical function of the force-bearing tissues has increased, and it has become clear that these tissues adapt to loading and unloading and furthermore that force transmission mechanics is more complex than previously thought.

This case-control study compared the deoxygenation of the masseter during standardized tasks between TMD-free individuals with frequent self-reports of wake-time clenching and those with infrequent self-reports. University students ( N = 255) filled out the Oral Behavior Checklist. Fourteen females with high versus low scores-high parafunctional (HP) group ( n = 7, ≥80th percentile of score distribution) versus low parafunctional (LP) group ( n = 7, ≤20th percentile)-completed 2 sessions during which they clenched at their maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) for 2 min and at 10% to 20% MVC for 20 min. Tissue oxygen saturation (StO2) and changes in oxygenated hemoglobin, deoxygenated hemoglobin, and total hemoglobin of the masseter were measured via near-infrared spectroscopy and analyzed with a generalized mixed effect model. A significant interaction effect (task × study group) was found on all outcome measures, indicating that the deoxygenation pattern of the HP group differed from the LP group (all P < 0.001). MVC of the masseter induced an almost 5-times-greater reduction of StO2 in the HP group as compared with the LP group ( P = 0.023). However, the relative increase in StO2 at rest after the MVC was similar between groups ( P > 0.05). At the end of the prolonged MVC task (10% to 20%), the blood flow (change in total hemoglobin) was almost 6 times higher in the LP group as compared with baseline. On the contrary, it increased minimally in the HP group (all P < 0.001). Healthy individuals at risk for TMD have abnormalities in masseter deoxygenation. Future prospective studies are needed to test whether this contributes to the onset of muscular TMD."

Information obtained from these experiments correlates with residue solvent exposure within the protein in solution. However, it is impossible to determine protein structure from covalent labeling data alone. Incorporation of sparse covalent labeling data into the protein structure prediction software Rosetta has been shown to improve protein tertiary structure prediction. Here, covalent labeling techniques were analyzed computationally to provide insight into what labeling data is needed to optimize tertiary protein structure prediction in Rosetta. We have successfully implemented a new scoring functionality that provides improved predictions. We developed two new covalent labeling based score terms that use a ""cone""-based neighbor count to quantify the relative solvent exposure of each amino acid. To test our method, we used a set of 20 proteins with structures deposited in the Protein Data Bank. Decoy model sets were generated for each of these 20 proteins, and the normalized covalent labeling score versus RMSD distributions were evaluated. On the basis of these distributions, we have determined an optimal subset of residues to use when performing covalent labeling experiments in order to maximize the structure prediction capabilities of the covalent labeling data. We also investigated how much false negative and false positive data can be tolerated without meaningfully impacting protein structure prediction. Using these new covalent labeling score terms, protein models were rescored and the resulting models improved by 3.9 Å RMSD on average. New models were also generated using Rosetta's AbinitioRelax program under the guidance of covalent labeling information, and improvement in model quality was observed.",Chromium-Mediated Stannylcyclopropanation of Alkenes with (Diiodomethyl)stannanes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30946593,Organic letters,2019 06 13,"A stannyl-group-substituted gem-dichromiomethane species, generated in situ from CrCl2, TMEDA, and tributyl(diiodomethyl)stannane, worked as an efficient stannylcarbene equivalent to promote cyclopropanation of alkenes.

We establish the phase diagram ( T vs 1/ d) of confined water covering a broad range of pore diameters. A linear dependence of the heterogeneous and the homogeneous nucleation temperatures on the inverse pore diameter is shown. The two lines converge at a pore diameter of ∼2.6 nm, below which formation of stable crystals is suppressed. By combining dielectric spectroscopy and different NMR techniques, we determine the dynamics of water within mesoporous silica over broad temperature and frequency ranges. Both techniques identify two dynamically distinguishable fractions of confined water coexisting within the pores. We attribute the two fractions to an interfacial water layer at the pore walls and confined water in the pore interior. Two alternative scenarios are proposed to rationalize the coexistence of two dynamically distinguishable water fractions. In the first scenario, two liquid fractions of water coexist under extreme confinement conditions for a range of temperatures; we discuss similarities with the two ultraviscous liquids (high-density liquid and low-density liquid) put forward for supercooled bulk water. In the second scenario, a liquid and a solid phase coexist; we conjecture that highly distorted and unstable crystal nuclei exist under extreme confinement that exhibit reorientation dynamics with time scales intermediate to the surrounding confined liquid and to bulk ice."

These compounds are easily synthesized by reacting Al[L]Cl with an equimolar amount of anhydrous Lewis acid and were characterized by elemental analyses, ESI-MS, MALDI-TOF MS, 1H, 13C{1H}, and multinuclear NMR spectroscopy. DFT calculations showed that Al[L]+ cations containing bidentate NO coordination of the morpholine group are at least 21.1 kJ/mol more stable when compared to hypothetical monodentate (N bound) structures. When combined with protic co-initiators (EtOH, glycerol carbonate), the cationic complexes, where [WCA]- = [GaCl4]- or [InCl4]-, are living catalyst systems for the polymerization of ε-caprolactone, producing polycaprolactone with narrow dispersity ( D̵ = 1.00-1.05). Employing glycidol as a co-initiator furnished polymers with narrow dispersity ( D̵ = 1.01-1.07) but experimental molecular weights diverged considerably from the calculated values. Similar reactivity toward ROP was observed for all complexes containing a stable [WCA]- but where [WCA]- = [AlCl4]-, upon combination with alcohols, alcoholysis was observed. Kinetic studies (Eyring analyses) allowed the determination of activation parameters, which were consistent with a coordination-insertion mechanism for the catalysts containing [WCA]- = [GaCl4]- or [InCl4]-. End group analyses using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and 1H NMR spectroscopy showed hydroxyl and ester end groups within the polymer, corroborating the proposed mechanism.

Global models simulate air-sea exchange based either on an atmospheric or ocean model simulation and treat the other media as a boundary condition. Here we develop a new modeling capability (NJUCPL) that couples GEOS-Chem (atmospheric model) and MITgcm (ocean model) at the native hourly model time step. The coupled model is evaluated against high-frequency simultaneous measurements of elemental mercury (Hg0) in both the atmosphere and surface ocean obtained during five published cruises in the Atlantic, Pacific, and Southern Oceans. Results indicate that the calculated global Hg net evasion flux is 12% higher for the online model than the offline model. We find that the coupled online model captures the spatial pattern of the observations; specifically, it improves the representation of peak seawater Hg0 (Hg0aq) concentration associated with enhanced precipitation in the intertropical convergence zone in both the Atlantic and the Pacific Oceans. We investigate the causes of the observed Hg0aq peaks with two sensitivity simulations and show that the high Hg0aq concentrations are associated with elevated convective cloud mass flux and bromine concentrations in the tropical upper troposphere. Observations of elevated Hg0aq concentrations in the western tropical Pacific Ocean merit further study involving BrO vertical distribution and cloud resolving models.","Characterization of Rh-Al Bond in Rh(PAlP) (PAlP = Pincer-type Diphosphino-Aluminyl Ligand) in Comparison with Rh(L)(PMe3)2 (L = AlMe2, Al(NMe2)2, BR2, SiR3, CH3, Cl, or OCH3): Theoretical Insight.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30946577,Inorganic chemistry,2019 04 24,"The unique Rh-Al bond in recently synthesized Rh(PAlP) 1 {PAlP = pincer-type diphosphino-aluminyl ligand Al[NCH2(P iPr2)]2(C6H4)2NMe} was investigated using the DFT method. Complex 1 has four doubly occupied nonbonding d orbitals on the Rh atom and one Rh d orbital largely participating in the Rh-Al bond which exhibits considerably large bonding overlap between Rh and Al atoms like in a covalent bond. Interestingly, Rhδ--Alδ+ polarization is observed in the bonding MO of 1, which is reverse to Rhδ+-Eδ- (E = coordinating atom) polarization found in a usual coordinate bond. This unusual polarization arises from the presence of the Al valence orbital at significantly higher energy than the Rh valence orbital energy. Characteristic features of 1 are further unveiled by comparing 1 with similar Rh complexes RhL(PMe3)2 (2 for L = AlMe2, 3 for L = Al(NMe2)2, 4 for L = BMe2, 5 for L = SiMe3, 6 for L = SiH3, 7 for L = CH3, 8 for L = OMe, and 9 for L = Cl). As expected, 7, 8, and 9 exhibit usual Rhδ+-Eδ- polarization (E = coordinating atom) in the Rh-E bonding MO. On the other hand, the reverse Rhδ--Eδ+ polarization is observed in the Rh-E bonding MOs of 2-5 like in 1, while the Rh-Si bond is polarized little in 6. These results are clearly understood in terms of the valence orbital energy of the ligand. Because the LUMO of 1 mainly consists of the Rh 4dσ, 5s, and 5p orbitals and the Al 3s and 3p orbitals, both Rh and Al atoms play the role of coordinating site for a substrate bearing a lone pair orbital. For instance, NH3 and pyridine coordinate to both Al and Rh atoms with considerably large binding energy. PAlP exhibits significantly strong trans influence, which is as strong as that of SiMe3 but moderately weaker than that of BMe2. The trans influence of these ligands is mainly determined by the valence orbital energy of the ligand and the covalent bond radius of the coordinating E atom.",Realization of High Thermoelectric Figure of Merit in Solution Synthesized 2D SnSe Nanoplates via Ge Alloying.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30946576,Journal of the American Chemical Society,2019 04 17,"Recently single crystals of layered SnSe have created a paramount importance in thermoelectrics owing to their ultralow lattice thermal conductivity and high thermoelectric figure of merit ( zT). However, nanocrystalline or polycrystalline SnSe offers a wide range of thermoelectric applications for the ease of its synthesis and machinability. Here, we demonstrate high zT of ∼2.1 at 873 K in two-dimensional nanoplates of Ge-doped SnSe synthesized by a simple hydrothermal route followed by spark plasma sintering (SPS). Anisotropic measurements also show a high zT of ∼1.75 at 873 K parallel to the SPS pressing direction. Ge doping (3 mol %) in SnSe nanoplates significantly enhances the p-type carrier concentration, which results in high electrical conductivity and power factor of ∼5.10 μW/cm K2 at 873 K. High lattice anharmonicity, nanoscale grain boundaries, and Ge precipitates in the SnSe matrix synergistically give rise to the ultralow lattice thermal conductivity of ∼0.18 W/mK at 873 K.",The Influence of Cu and Al Additives on Reduction of Iron(III) Oxide: In Situ XRD and XANES Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30946575,Inorganic chemistry,2019 04 24,"The reduction of Fe-based nanocomposite catalysts doped with Al and Cu has been studied using in situ X-ray diffraction (XRD), in situ X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES), and temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) techniques. The catalysts have been synthesized by melting of iron, aluminum, and copper salts. According to XRD, the catalysts consist mainly of Fe2O3 and Al2O3 phases. Alumina is in an amorphous state, whereas iron oxide forms nanoparticles with the protohematite structure. The Al3+ cations are partially dissolved in the Fe2O3 lattice. Due to strong alumina-iron oxide interaction, the specific surface area of the catalysts increases significantly. TPR and XANES data indicate that copper forms highly dispersed surface CuO nanoparticles and partially dissolves in iron oxide. It has been shown that the reduction of iron(III) oxide by CO proceeds via two routes: a direct two-stage reduction of iron(III) oxide to metal (Fe2O3 → Fe3O4 → Fe) or an indirect three-stage reduction with the formation of FeO intermediate phases (Fe2O3 → Fe3O4 → FeO → Fe). The introduction of Al into Fe2O3 leads to a decrease in the rate for all reduction steps. In addition, the introduction of Al stabilizes small Fe3O4 particles and prevents further sintering of the iron oxide. The mechanism of stabilization is associated with the formation of Fe3- xAl xO4 solid solution. The addition of copper to the Fe-Al catalyst leads to the formation of highly dispersed CuO particles on the catalyst surface and a mixed oxide with a spinel-type crystalline structure similar to that of CuFe2O4. The low-temperature reduction of Cu2+ to Cu0 accelerates the Fe2O3 → Fe3O4 and FeO → Fe transformations but does not affect the Fe3O4 → FeO/Fe stages. These changes in the reduction properties significantly affect the catalytic performance of the Fe-based nanocomposite catalysts in the low-temperature oxidation of CO.",Sodium Metal Anodes: Emerging Solutions to Dendrite Growth.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30946573,Chemical reviews,2019 04 24,"This comprehensive Review focuses on the key challenges and recent progress regarding sodium-metal anodes employed in sodium-metal batteries (SMBs). The metal anode is the essential component of emerging energy storage systems such as sodium sulfur and sodium selenium, which are discussed as example full-cell applications. We begin with a description of the differences in the chemical and physical properties of Na metal versus the oft-studied Li metal, and a corresponding discussion regarding the number of ways in which Na does not follow Li-inherited paradigms in its electrochemical behavior. We detail the major challenges for Na-metal systems that at this time limit the feasibility of SMBs. The core Na anode problems are the following interrelated degradation mechanisms: An unstable solid electrolyte interphase with most organic electrolytes, ""mossy"" and ""lath-like"" metal dendrite growth for liquid systems, poor Coulombic efficiency, and gas evolution. Even solid-state Na batteries are not immune, with metal dendrites being reported. The solutions may be subdivided into the following interrelated taxonomy: Improved electrolytes and electrolyte additives tailored for Na-metal anodes, interfacial engineering between the metal and the liquid or solid electrolyte, electrode architectures that both reduce the current density during plating-stripping and serve as effective hosts that shield the Na metal from excessive reactions, and alloy design to tune the bulk properties of the metal per se. For instance, stable plating-stripping of Na is extremely difficult with conventional carbonate solvents but has been reported with ethers and glymes. Solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) such as beta-alumina solid electrolyte (BASE), sodium superionic conductor (NASICON), and sodium thiophosphate (75Na2S·25P2S5) present highly exciting opportunities for SMBs that avoid the dangers of flammable liquids. Even SSEs are not immune to dendrites, however, which grow through the defects in the bulk pellet, but may be controlled through interfacial energy modification. We conclude with a discussion of the key research areas that we feel are the most fruitful for further pursuit. In our opinion, greatly improved understanding and control of the SEI structure is the key to cycling stability. A holistic approach involving complementary post-mortem, in situ, and operando analyses to elucidate full battery cell level structure-performance relations is advocated.",Characterization of Thiamine Diphosphate-Dependent 4-Hydroxybenzoylformate Decarboxylase Enzymes from Rhodococcus jostii RHA1 and Pseudomonas fluorescens Pf-5 Involved in Degradation of Aryl C2 Lignin Degradation Fragments.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30946572,Biochemistry,2019 06 11,"A thiamine diphosphate-dependent enzyme annotated as a benzoylformate decarboxylase is encoded by gene cluster ro02984-ro02986 in Rhodococcus jostii RHA1 previously shown to generate vanillin and 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde from lignin oxidation, and a closely related gene cluster is also found in the genome of Pseudomonas fluorescens Pf-5. Two hypotheses for possible pathways involving a thiamine diphosphate-dependent cleavage, either C-C cleavage of a ketol or diketone aryl C3 substrate or decarboxylation of an aryl C2 substrate, were investigated by expression and purification of the recombinant enzymes and expression of dehydrogenase and oxidase enzymes also found in the gene clusters. The ThDP-dependent enzymes showed no activity for cleavage of aryl C3 ketol or diketone substrates but showed activity for decarboxylation of benzoylformate and 4-hydroxybenzoylformate. A flavin-dependent oxidase encoded by gene ro02984 was found to oxidize either mandelic acid or phenylglyoxal. The crystal structure of the P. fluorescens decarboxylase enzyme was determined at 1.69 Å resolution, showing similarity to structures of known benzoylformate decarboxylase enzymes. The P. fluorescens decarboxylase enzyme showed enhanced carboligase activity between vanillin and acetaldehyde, rationalized by the presence of alanine versus serine at residue 73 in the enzyme active site, which was investigated further by site-directed mutagenesis of this residue. A hypothesis for a pathway for degradation of aryl C2 fragments arising from oxidative cleavage of phenylcoumaran and diarylpropane structures in lignin is proposed.",Penetration and Uptake of Nanoparticles in 3D Tumor Spheroids.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30946570,Bioconjugate chemistry,2019 05 15,"Animal models are effective for assessing tumor localization of nanosystems but difficult to use for studying penetration beyond the vasculature. Here, we have used well-characterized HCT116 colorectal cancer spheroids to study the effect of nanoparticle (NP) physicochemical properties on penetration and uptake. Incubation of spheroids with Hoechst 33342 resulted in a dye gradient, which facilitated discrimination between the populations of cells in the core and at the periphery of spheroids by flow cytometry. This approach was used to compare doxorubicin and liposomal doxorubicin (Caelyx) and a range of model poly(styrene) nanoparticles of different sizes (30 nm, 50 nm, 100 nm) and with different surface chemistries (50 nm uniform plain, carboxylated, aminated and a range of NPs and polyethylene glycol modified NPs prepared from a promising new functionalized biodegradable polymer (poly(glycerol-adipate), PGA). Unmodified poly(styrene) nanoparticles (30 nm/50 nm) were able to penetrate to the core of HCT116 spheroids more efficiently than larger poly(styrene) nanoparticles (100 nm). Surprisingly, penetration of 30 and 50 nm particles was as good as clinically relevant doxorubicin concentrations. However, penetration was reduced with higher surface charge. PGA NPs of 100 nm showed similar penetration into spheroids as 50 nm poly(styrene) nanoparticles, which may be related to polymer flexibility. PEG surface modification of polymeric particles significantly improved penetration into the spheroid core. The new model combining the use of spheroids Hoechst staining and flow cytometry was a useful model for assessing NP penetration and gives useful insights into the effects of NPs' physical properties when designing nanomedicines.",Probing the Cys-Tyr Cofactor Biogenesis in Cysteine Dioxygenase by the Genetic Incorporation of Fluorotyrosine.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30946568,Biochemistry,2019 04 30,"Cysteine dioxygenase (CDO) is a nonheme iron enzyme that adds two oxygen atoms from dioxygen to the sulfur atom of l-cysteine. Adjacent to the iron site of mammalian CDO, there is a post-translationally generated Cys-Tyr cofactor, whose presence substantially enhances the oxygenase activity. The formation of the Cys-Tyr cofactor in CDO is an autocatalytic process, and it is challenging to study by traditional techniques because the cross-linking reaction is a side, uncoupled, single-turnover oxidation buried among multiple turnovers of l-cysteine oxygenation. Here, we take advantage of our recent success in obtaining a purely uncross-linked human CDO due to site-specific incorporation of 3,5-difluoro-l-tyrosine (F2-Tyr) at the cross-linking site through the genetic code expansion strategy. Using EPR spectroscopy, we show that nitric oxide (•NO), an oxygen surrogate, similarly binds to uncross-linked F2-Tyr157 CDO as in wild-type human CDO. We determined X-ray crystal structures of uncross-linked F2-Tyr157 CDO and mature wild-type CDO in complex with both l-cysteine and •NO. These structural data reveal that the active site cysteine (Cys93 in the human enzyme), rather than the generally expected tyrosine (i.e., Tyr157), is well-aligned to be oxidized should the normal oxidation reaction uncouple. This structure-based understanding is further supported by a computational study with models built on the uncross-linked ternary complex structure. Together, these results strongly suggest that the first target to oxidize during the iron-assisted Cys-Tyr cofactor biogenesis is Cys93. Based on these data, a plausible reaction mechanism implementing a cysteine radical involved in the cross-link formation is proposed.","Fabrication of SnS/TiO2@GO Composite Coated Glassy Carbon Electrode for Concomitant Determination of Paracetamol, Tryptophan, and Caffeine in Pharmaceutical Formulations.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30946567,Analytical chemistry,2019 05 08,"Designing an electrochemical sensor which is simple, cheap, sensitive, fast, and accurate is inevitable, as it is important in drug quality control, point-of-care diagnosis, and other clinical studies. Sensors for simultaneous determination of paracetamol, tryptophan, and caffeine have not been reported so far, and we report an electrochemical sensor via incorporating tin sulfide (SnS) and titanium dioxide (TiO2) on graphene oxide (GO) sheets (SnS/TiO2@GO ternary composite) for their separate and simultaneous determination through cyclic voltammetry and differential pulse voltammetry techniques. The surface morphology and structural properties of the composite were characterized by analytical techniques. The electrochemical study of SnS/TiO2@GO composite modified glassy carbon electrode (GC-SnS/TiO2@GO) showed high activity toward the oxidation of paracetamol, tryptophan, and caffeine with significant decrease in overpotential due to large surface and high carrier mobility. The peak currents during separate determination of paracetamol, tryptophan, and caffeine increased linearly with the increase in concentration from 9.8 nM to 280 μM for paracetamol, from 13.3 nM to 157 μM for tryptophan, and from 16.6 nM to 333 μM for caffeine. The detection limit (3σ/ S) was 7.5, 7.8, and 4.4 nM for paracetamol, tryptophan, and caffeine, respectively. The electron transfer coefficient (α), surface coverage concentration (Γ), number of electrons transferred ( n), and diffusion coefficient ( D) were calculated and discussed. The fabricated electrode showed low detection limit, wide linear range, and excellent reproducibility, selectivity, and stability. The study was also extended to the analysis of commercial tablets, beverage and human blood serum.Therefore, the present electrode holds great promise for identification and quantification of drugs in combination."

Ketamine has been administered by oral, sublingual, transmucosal, intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous, intranasal, and even rectal routes. Whereas intravenous ketamine is the best studied approach, common sense dictates that oral ketamine is the most practical. The bioavailability of oral ketamine and interindividual variations thereof have been poorly studied; possibly only 20%-25% of an oral dose reaches the bloodstream. This is not necessarily a limitation because, as with other drugs that have poor oral bioavailability, compensation is possible by administering an appropriately higher dose, and interindividual variations can be addressed through individualized dose up-titration. A quarter- century of experience supports the use of oral ketamine for treating acute and chronic pain in children and adults. Case reports, case series, chart reviews, and 3 recent randomized controlled trials (RCTs) show that oral ketamine is effective in treating severe depression, depression with suicidal ideation, and treatment-resistant depression; that oral ketamine, used as an augmentation agent, improves outcomes in patients receiving a conventional antidepressant; and that oral ketamine reduces depression in patients with chronic pain. Doses of oral ketamine have ranged from 0.25 to 7 mg/kg and from 50 mg per occasion to 300 mg per occasion in multiple daily dosing, daily dosing, and intermittent dosing schedules. Oral ketamine was well tolerated in all studies; dropout and reasons for dropout were similar in ketamine and control arms in the 3 RCTs. These findings suggest that if ketamine is to find a place as an off-label treatment for depression and suicidality in mainstream psychiatry, researchers should study the safety, efficacy, and optimization of oral ketamine. Intravenous and intranasal routes may be monetarily more promising, but the oral route could be of greatest service."

The incorporation of Fe effectively enhances the OER activity of Co-/Ni-based materials, but the corresponding role of Fe in Co-based (oxy)hydroxide materials still remains unresolved. Herein, α-Co1-m Fem (OH)x is synthesized and systematically engineered to study the effect of Fe content on the morphology, crystalline structure, electronic structure, and OER activity. As the Fe content is changed, the basic crystalline phase of α-Co1-m Fem (OH)x is consistent whereas the micromorphology changes. Much smaller and thinner nanoplates with more edge/defect sites are fabricated because of increased Fe incorporation. When the Fe content is more than 0.1, twin nanoparticles emerge at the edge/defect sites of the sister nanoplate. Additionally, the OER activity of α-Co1-m Fem (OH)x against Fe content can be plotted as a volcano curve. These data thus support a hypothesis that the edge/defect sites in α-Co1-m Fem (OH)x are responsible for the OER performance. The incorporation of Fe leads to not only the accelerated intrinsic reactivity of each active site, which is attributed to the strong electronic interaction between Co and Fe but also changes the number of edge/defect sites.",The Application of Micro- and Nanomotors in Classified Drug Delivery.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30946529,"Chemistry, an Asian journal",2019 05 02,"Micro and nanomotors (MNMs) are micro/nanoscale devices that are able to convert chemical or external energy into mechanical motion.

It includes conventional pathologies affecting cardiovascular functions such as hypertension, atherosclerosis or thrombosis and was traditionally considered from the metabolic point of view. This Cardiovascular Continuum, originally described by Dzau and Braunwald, was extended by O'Rourke to consider also the crucial role played by degradation of elastic fibers, occurring during aging, in the appearance of vascular stiffness, another deleterious risk factor of the continuum. However, the involvement of the elastin degradation products, named elastin-derived peptides, to the Cardiovascular Continuum progression has not been considered before. Data from our laboratory and others clearly showed that these bioactive peptides are central regulators of this continuum, thereby amplifying appearance and evolution of cardiovascular risk factors such as diabetes or hypertension, of vascular alterations such as atherothrombosis and calcification, but also nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. The Elastin Receptor Complex has been shown to be a crucial actor in these processes. We propose here the participation of these elastin-derived peptides and of the Elastin Receptor Complex in these events, and introduce a revisited Cardiovascular Continuum based on their involvement, for which elastin-based pharmacological strategies could have a strong impact in the future.","The four-layer graft technique, a hard and soft tissue graft from the tuberosity in one piece.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30946527,Journal of esthetic and restorative dentistry : official publication of the American Academy of Esthetic Dentistry ...

However, despite its excellent optoelectronic properties, the phase instability of CsPbI3 poses a critical hurdle for practical application. In this study, a novel stain-mediated phase stabilization strategy is demonstrated to significantly enhance the phase stability of cubic α-phase CsPbI3 . Careful control of the degree of spatial confinement induced by anodized aluminum oxide (AAO) templates with varying pore sizes leads to effective manipulation of the phase stability of α-CsPbI3 . The Williamson-Hall method in conjunction with density functional theory calculations clearly confirms that the strain imposed on the perovskite lattice when confined in vertically aligned nanopores can alter the formation energy of the system, stabilizing α-CsPbI3 at room temperature. Finally, the CsPbI3 grown inside nanoporous AAO templates exhibits exceptional phase stability over three months under ambient conditions, in which the resulting light-emitting diode reveals a natural red color emission with very narrow bandwidth (full width at half maximum of 33 nm) at 702 nm. The universally applicable template-based stabilization strategy can give in-depth insights on the strain-mediated phase transition mechanism in all-inorganic perovskites.","Long-term androgen deprivation, with or without radiotherapy, in locally-advanced prostate cancer: updated results from a phase III randomized trial.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30946523,BJU international,2019 04 04,We previously reported results of a randomized trial comparing androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) combined with external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) and ADT alone in patients treated with locally advanced prostate cancer.

This is explained, in part, by its great ability to take up Zn2+ ions from living tissues, which is induced by the ZafA transcription factor. This study shows that the ZafA-mediated regulation of fungal growth is also influenced by iron availability and that A. fumigatus is well adapted to grow in zinc-limiting and zinc-replete media with Zn:Fe ratios lower in the former than in the latter. Accordingly, this indicates that iron availability appears to be more critical for fungal growth in zinc-replete than in zinc-limiting environments. Interestingly, the cross-regulation of zinc/iron homeostasis under zinc-replete conditions relies on an unprecedented iron-mediated regulation of different zafA transcription units that, along with a limited transcript translation, allows synthesizing the right basal amount of ZafA dependent on iron availability. We posit that this regulatory strategy has evolved in fungi as a mechanism to adjust zinc intake to iron availability under zinc-replete conditions. Thus, fungal growth is enhanced in zinc- and iron-replete media but restricted by reducing zinc intake under iron starvation to prevent the noxious side effects of an intracellular zinc excess during iron deficiency.",Promoting Frustrated Lewis Pairs for Heterogeneous Chemoselective Hydrogenation via the Tailored Pore Environment within Metal-Organic Frameworks.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30946520,Angewandte Chemie (International ed. in English),2019 05 20,"Frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) have recently been advanced as efficient metal-free catalysts for catalytic hydrogenation, but their performance in chemoselective hydrogenation, particularly in heterogeneous systems, has not yet been achieved. Herein, we demonstrate that, via tailoring the pore environment within metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), FLPs not only can be stabilized but also can develop interesting performance in the chemoselective hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated organic compounds, which cannot be achieved with FLPs in a homogeneous system. Using hydrogen gas under moderate pressure, the FLP anchored within a MOF that features open metal sites and hydroxy groups on the pore walls can serve as a highly efficient heterogeneous catalyst to selectively reduce the imine bond in α,β-unsaturated imine substrates to afford unsaturated amine compounds."

Molecular subtyping has arisen in the past two decades as a promising strategy to give better predictions of glioblastoma multiforme evolution, common disease pathways, and rational treatment options. The Cancer Genome Atlas network initially identified four molecular subtypes of glioblastoma multiforme: proneural, neural, mesenchymal and classical. However, further studies, also investigated glioma stem cells, have only identified two to three subtypes: proneural, mesenchymal and classical. The proneural-mesenchymal transition upon tumour recurrence has been suggested as a mechanism of tumour resistance to radiation and chemotherapy treatment. Glioblastoma multiforme patients with the mesenchymal subtype tend to survive shorter than other subtypes when analysis is restricted to samples with low transcriptional heterogeneity. Although the mesenchymal signature in malignant glioma may seem at odds with the common idea of the ectodermal origin of neural-glial lineages, the presence of the mesenchymal signature in glioma is supported by several studies suggesting that it can result from: (i) intrinsic expression of tumour cells affected with accumulated genetic mutations and cell of origin; (ii) tumour micro-environments with recruited macrophages or microglia, mesenchymal stem cells or pericytes, and other progenitors; (iii) resistance to tumour treatment, including radiotherapy, antiangiogenic therapy and possibly chemotherapy. Genetic abnormalities, mainly NF1 mutations, together with NF-κB transcriptional programs, are the main driver of acquiring mesenchymal-signature. This signature is far from being simply tissue artefacts, as it has been identified in single cell glioma, circulating tumour cells, and glioma stem cells that are released from the tumour micro-environment. All these together suggest that the mesenchymal signature in glioblastoma multiforme is induced and sustained via cell intrinsic mechanisms and tumour micro-environment factors. Although patients with the mesenchymal subtype tend to have poorer prognosis, they may have favourable response to immunotherapy and intensive radio- and chemotherapy.",Relationship of stroke volume to different patterns of Cheyne-Stokes respiration in heart failure.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30946471,Sleep,2019 04 09,"In patients with heart failure (HF) and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (HFrEF), stroke volume (SV) falls during hyperpnea of Cheyne-Stokes respiration with central sleep apnea (CSR-CSA). We have identified two distinct patterns of hyperpnea: positive, in which end-expiratory lung volume (EELV) remains at or above functional residual capacity (FRC), and negative, in which EELV falls below FRC. The increase in expiratory intrathoracic pressure generated by the latter should have effects on the heart analogous to external chest compression. To test the hypotheses that in HFrEF patients, CSR-CSA with the negative pattern has an auto-resuscitation effect such that compared with the positive pattern, it is associated with a smaller fall in SV and a smaller increase in cardiac workload (product of heart rate and systolic blood pressure).",Clinical and Video-Polysomnographic Analysis of Rem Sleep Behavior Disorder and other Sleep Disturbances in Dementia with Lewy Bodies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30946468,Sleep,2019 04 04,To study REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) and other sleep disorders in dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB).,Clinical impact of intraoperative electronic health record downtime on surgical patients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30946466,Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,2019 04 04,"Despite increased use of electronic health records (EHRs), the clinical impact of system downtime is unknown.",Patient experience with family history tool: analysis of patients' experience sharing their family health history through patient-computer dialogue in a patient portal.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30946464,Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,2019 06 13,"The collection and use of a family health history are important for assessing the patient's risk of disease, but history taking is often impeded by practical barriers in the office.

In addition to the importance of the consolidation of relevant memories, the capacity to forget unwanted memories is also crucial. We investigated the effect of suppressing unwanted memories on EEG activity of subsequent sleep using a motivated forgetting (MF) paradigm as compared with a control non-forgetting task. Subjects were randomly assigned to nap or no-nap groups. We used a modified version of the think\no-think paradigm with dominant number of no-think words cued to be forgotten and included only subjects capable of suppressing unwanted memories by performing an initial subject inclusion experiment. In both groups and conditions, the performance of the subjects in recalling the word pairs learnt in the beginning of the day was evaluated in a final recall test. We found that both nap and no-nap groups recalled significantly less no-think words in the MF condition compared to the control condition. Moreover, for the nap group, in the MF compared to the control condition, spindle power and density increased during stage 2 (S2) while they decreased during slow wave sleep (SWS). Interestingly, recall performance of no-think words was negatively correlated with spindle power during S2 while it was positively correlated with spindle power during SWS. These results indicate that sleep spindles are sensitive to the previous MF experiences and suggest a differential role of sleep spindles during S2 and SWS in memory processing during sleep."
