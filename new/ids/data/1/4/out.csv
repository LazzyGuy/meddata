Using a neutropenic murine-lung infection model, the objectives of this study were to identify the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) index most closely associated with efficacy and the magnitude of such indices necessary for solithromycin efficacy against Streptococcus pneumoniae Plasma and epithelial lining fluid (ELF) samples for pharmacokinetics (PK) were collected serially over 24 hours from healthy mice administered single doses of solithromycin (0.625 to 40 mg/kg). Neutropenic CD-1 mice infected with 108 colony forming units (CFU) of one of five S. pneumoniae isolates were administered solithromycin (0.156 to 160 mg/kg/day) via oral gavage. Doses were administered in a fractionated manner for mice infected with one isolate while mice infected with the remaining four isolates received solithromycin as either a q6h or q12h regimen. A three-compartment model best described solithromycin PK in the plasma and ELF (r2 = 0.935 and 0.831, respectively). The ratio of total-drug ELF to free-drug plasma area under the concentration-time curve from time 0 to 24 hours (AUC) was 2.7. Free-drug plasma and total-drug ELF AUC to minimum inhibitory concentration ratios (AUC/MIC ratios) were most predictive of efficacy (r2 = 0.851 and 0.850, respectively). The magnitude of free-drug plasma/total-drug ELF AUC/MIC ratios associated with net bacterial stasis, and a 1- and 2-log10 CFU reduction from baseline was 1.65/1.26, 6.31/15.1, and 12.8/59.8, respectively. These data provided dose selection support for solithromycin for clinical trials in patients with community-acquired bacterial pneumonia.",In Vitro Activity of Bedaquiline and Delamanid Against Nontuberculous Mycobacteria Including Macrolide-Resistant Clinical Isolates.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31182533,Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,2019 06 11,"We evaluated the in vitro activities of the antimicrobial drugs bedaquiline and delamanid against the major pathogenic nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM). Delamanid showed high MIC values for all NTM except Mycobacterium kansasii However, bedaquiline showed low MIC values for the major pathogenic NTM, including M. avium complex, M. abscessus, M. massiliense, and M. kansasii Bedaquiline also had low MIC values with macrolide-resistant NTM and warrants further investigation as a potential antibiotic for NTM treatment.",A revised species concept for opportunistic Mucor species reveals species specific antifungal susceptibility profiles.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31182532,Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,2019 06 11,"Recently, the species concept of opportunistic Mucor circinelloides and its relatives has been revised, resulting in the recognition of its classical formae as independent species and the description of new species. In this study we used isolates of all clinically relevant Mucor species and performed susceptibility testing using the EUCAST reference method to identify potential species-specific susceptibility patterns. In vitro susceptibility profiles of 101 mucoralean strains belonging to the genus Mucor (72), and the closely related species Cokeromyces recurvatus (3), as well as Rhizopus (12), Lichtheimia (10) and Rhizomucor (4) to six antifungals (amphotericin B, natamycin, terbinafine, isavuconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole) were determined. The most active drug for all Mucorales was amphotericin B. Antifungal susceptibility profiles of pathogenic Mucor species were specific for isavuconazole, itraconazole and posaconazole. The species formerly united in M. circinelloides showed clear differences in their antifungal susceptibilities. Cokeromyces recurvatus, M. ardhlaengiktus, M. lusitanicus and M. ramosissimus exhibited high MICs to all azoles tested. Mucor indicus presented high MICs for isavuconazole and posaconazole and M. amphibiorum and M. irregularis showed high MICs for isavuconazole. MIC values of Mucor spp. for posaconazole, isavuconazole and itraconazole were high compared to those for Rhizopus and the Lichtheimiaceae (Lichtheimia and Rhizomucor). Molecular identification combined with in vitro susceptibility testing is recommended for Mucor species especially if azoles are applied in treatment.",Bedaquiline eliminates bactericidal activity of β-lactams against Mycobacterium abscessus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31182531,Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,2019 06 11,"The β-lactams imipenem and cefoxitin are used for the treatment of Mycobacterium abscessus lung infections. Here, we show that these cell wall synthesis inhibitors trigger a lethal bacterial ATP burst by increasing oxidative phosphorylation. Co-treatment of M. abscessus with the anti-mycobacterial ATP synthase inhibitor bedaquiline suppresses this ATP burst and eliminates the bactericidal activity of β-lactams. Thus, add-on of bedaquiline to β-lactam containing regimes may affect treatment outcome negatively.",Nacubactam enhances meropenem activity against carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae producing Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemases (KPC).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31182530,Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,2019 06 11,"Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) are resistant to most antibiotics, making CRE infections difficult to treat with available agents. Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemases (KPC-2 and KPC-3) are predominant carbapenemases in CRE in the United States. Nacubactam is a bridged diazabicyclooctane (DBO) β-lactamase inhibitor that inactivates class A and C β-lactamases and exhibits intrinsic antibiotic and β-lactam ""enhancer"" activity against Enterobacteriaceae. In this study, we examined a collection of meropenem resistant K. pneumoniae isolates carrying blaKPC-2 or blaKPC-3; meropenem-nacubactam restored susceptibility. Upon testing isogenic Escherichia coli strains producing KPC-2 variants with single residue substitutions at important Ambler class A positions (K73, S130, R164, E166, N170, D179, K234, E276, etc.), the K234R variant increased the meropenem-nacubactam minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) compared to KPC-2, without increasing the meropenem MIC. Correspondingly, nacubactam inhibited KPC-2 (Ki app 31±3 μM) more efficiently than the K234R variant (Ki app 270±27 μM) and displayed a faster acylation rate (KPC-2 k2/K = 5,815±582 M-1s-1 vs. K234R k2/K = 247±25 M-1s-1). Unlike avibactam, timed mass spectrometry revealed an intact sulfate on nacubactam and a novel peak (+337 Da) with the K234R variant. Molecular modeling of the K234R variant showed significant catalytic residue (i.e., S70, K73, and S130) rearrangements that likely interfere with nacubactam binding and acylation. Nacubactam's aminoethoxy tail formed unproductive interactions with the K234R variant's active site. Molecular modeling and docking observations are consistent with the biochemical analyses. Overall, the meropenem-nacubactam combination is effective against carbapenem resistant K. pneumoniae; moreover β-lactam inhibition by nacubactam acts through an alternative mechanism compared to avibactam.",In vitro activity of chlorhexidine compared with seven antifungal agents against 98 Fusarium isolates recovered from fungal keratitis patients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31182529,Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,2019 06 11,"Background: Fungal keratitis is a common but severe eye infection in tropical and subtropical areas of the world. In regions with a temperate climate the frequency is rising in patients with contact lenses and following trauma. Early and adequate therapy is important to prevent disease progression and loss of vision. The management of Fusarium keratitis is complex, and the optimal treatment is not well defined. We investigated the in vitro activity of chlorhexidine and seven antifungal agents against a well characterized collection of Fusarium isolates, recovered from patients with Fusarium keratitis.Patients and methods: The fungus culture collection of the Center of Expertise in Mycology Radboudumc/CWZ was searched for Fusarium isolates that were cultured from cornea scrapings, ocular biopsies, eye swabs and contact lens fluid containers from patients suspected of keratitis. The Fusarium isolates that were cultured from patients with confirmed keratitis were all identified using conventional and molecular techniques. Antifungal susceptibility testing was performed according to the EUCAST broth microdilution reference method. The antifungal agents tested included amphotericin B, voriconazole, posaconazole, miconazole, natamycin, 5-fluorocystosine, and caspofungin. In addition, the activity of chlorhexidine was determined.Results: The fungal culture collection contained 98 Fusarium isolates of confirmed fungal keratitis cases from 83 Dutch patients and 15 Tanzanian patients. The isolates were collected between 2007 and 2017. F. oxysporum (n=24, 24.5%) was the most frequently isolated species followed by F. solani sensu stricto (n=18, 18.4%) and F. petroliphilum (n=11, 11.2%). In vitro amphotericin B was the most active antifungal drug followed by natamycin, voriconazole, posaconazole, and miconazole. Chlorhexidine showed activity against all. 5-Fluorocytosine showed no in vitro activity.Conclusion: Amphotericin B showed the most favorable in vitro inhibition of Fusarium species followed by natamycin, voriconazole and chlorhexidine, while 5-fluorocytosine, posaconazole, miconazole and caspofungin showed no relevant inhibiting effect. However, chlorhexidine showed fungicidal activity against 90% of F. oxysporum strains and 100% of the F. solani strains.Our study supports the clinical efficacy of chlorhexidine, and therefore warrants its further clinical evaluation for primary therapy of fungal keratitis, particularly in low and middle income countries where fungal keratitis is much more frequent and currently antifungal eye drops are often unavailable.","First time in human (FTIH) study and prediction of early bactericidal activity for GSK3036656, a potent Leucyl - tRNA synthetase inhibitor for tuberculosis treatment.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31182528,Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,2019 06 11,"This first time in human (FTIH) study evaluated the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and food effect of single and repeat oral doses of GSK3036656, a Leucyl - tRNA synthetase inhibitor. In Part A, GSK3036656 single doses of 5 (fed and fasted), 15, and 25 mg, and placebo were administered. In Part B, repeat doses of 5 and 15 mg and placebo were administered for 14 days once daily. GSK3036656 showed dose-proportional increase following single dose administration and after dosing for 14 days. Cmax and AUC(0-τ) showed accumulation with repeated administration of approximately 2- to 3- fold. Pharmacokinetic parameters were not altered in the presence of food. Unchanged GSK3036656 was the only drug-related component detected in plasma and accounted for approximately 90% of drug-related material in urine. Based on total drug - related material detected in urine, the minimum absorbed dose after single (25 mg) and repeat (15 mg) dosing was 50 and 78%, respectively. Unchanged GSK3036656 represented at least 44% and 71% of the 25 and 15 mg dose, respectively. Clinical trial simulations were performed to guide dose escalation during the FTIH study and to predict the GSK3036656 dose range that produces the highest possible early bactericidal activity (EBA0-14) in the prospective Phase II trial, with consideration of the predefined exposure limit. GSK3036656 was well tolerated after single and multiple doses with no reports of serious adverse events.","In Vitro Activity of APX001A (Manogepix) and Comparator Agents against 1,706 Fungal Isolates Collected During an International Surveillance Program (2017).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31182527,Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,2019 06 11,"Current antifungal agents cover a majority of opportunistic fungal pathogens; however, breakthrough invasive fungal infections continue to occur and increasingly involve relatively uncommon yeasts and moulds that often exhibit decreased susceptibility. APX001A (manogepix) is a first-in-class small molecule inhibitor of the conserved fungal Gwt1 protein. This enzyme is required for acylation of inositol during glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor biosynthesis. APX001A is active against the major fungal pathogens: Candida (except C. krusei), Aspergillus, and hard-to-treat moulds, including Fusarium and Scedosporium In this study, we tested APX001A and comparators against 1,706 contemporary clinical fungal isolates collected worldwide during 2017 from 68 medical centers in North America (37.3%), Europe (43.4%), Asia-Pacific (12.7%), and Latin America (6.6%). Among the isolates tested, 78.5% were Candida spp., 3.9% were non-Candida yeasts, including 30 Cryptococcus neoformans var. grubii (1.8%), 14.7% were Aspergillus spp., and 2.9% were other moulds. All isolates were tested by CLSI reference broth microdilution.APX001A (MIC50/90, 0.008/0.06 μg/ml) was the most active agent tested against Candida spp. isolates; corresponding anidulafungin, micafungin, and fluconazole MIC90 values were 16- to 64-fold higher. Similarly, APX001A (MIC50/90, 0.25/0.5 μg/ml) was ≥8-fold more active than anidulafungin, micafungin, and fluconazole against C. neoformans var. grubii Against Aspergillus spp., AXP001A (MEC50/90, 0.015/0.03 μg/ml) was comparable in activity to anidulafungin and micafungin. Aspergillus isolates (>98%) exhibited a wild-type phenotype for the mould active triazoles (itraconazole, posaconazole, and voriconazole). APX001A was highly active against uncommon species of Candida, non-Candida yeasts, and rare moulds, including 11 isolates of Scedosporium spp. (MEC values, 0.015-0.06 μg/ml).APX001A demonstrated potent in vitro activity against recent fungal isolates, including echinocandin- and fluconazole-resistant strains. The extended spectrum of APX001A was also notable for its potency against many less common, yet antifungal-resistant strains. Further studies are in progress to evaluate the clinical utility of the methyl phosphate prodrug, APX001, in difficult-to-treat resistant fungal infections.",Phage therapy of pneumonia is not associated with an over stimulation of the inflammatory response compared to antibiotic treatment in mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31182526,Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,2019 06 11,"
Background
 Supported by years of clinical use in some countries and more recently by literature on experimental models as well as compassionate use in Europe and in USA, bacteriophage (phage) therapy is providing a solution for difficult to treat bacterial infections. However, studies of the impact of such treatments on the host remain scarce. 
Methods
 Murine acute pneumonia initiated by intranasal instillation of two pathogenic strains of Escherichia coli (536 and LM33) were treated by two specific bacteriophages (536_P1 and LM33_P1; intranasal) or antibiotics (Ceftriaxone, Cefoxitin, Imipenem-Cilastatin; intraperitoneal). Healthy mice also received phages alone. Severity of pulmonary edema, acute inflammatory cytokines (blood and lung homogenates), complete blood count, bacteria and bacteriophages counts were obtained at early (≤12h) and late (≥20h) time points. 
Results
 Bacteriophage's efficacy to decrease bacterial load was faster than antibiotics, but both displayed similar endpoints. Bacteriophage treatment was not associated with an over-inflammation but in contrast tended to lower inflammation and provided a faster correction of blood cell count abnormalities compared to antibiotics. In absence of bacterial infection, bacteriophage 536_P1 promoted a weak increase in the production of anti-viral cytokines (INF-γ and IL-12) and chemokines in the lungs, but not in the blood. However, such variations were no longer observed when bacteriophage 536_P1 was administered to treat infected animals. 
Conclusions
 The rapid lysis of bacteria by bacteriophages in vivo does not increase the innate inflammatory response compared to an antibiotic treatment.","Sequential open label study of the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic interactions between dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine and mefloquine in healthy Thai adults.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31182525,Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,2019 06 11,"Background: Artemisinin based combination therapies (ACTs) have contributed substantially to the global decline in Plasmodium falciparum morbidity and mortality but resistance to artemisinins and their partner drugs is increasing in Southeast Asia, threatening malaria control. New antimalarial compounds will not be generally available soon. Combining three existing antimalarials in the form of Triple ACTs, including dihydroartemisinin (DHA)-piperaquine plus mefloquine, is a potential treatment option for multidrug resistant Plasmodium falciparum malaria.Methods: In a sequential open label study, healthy Thai volunteers were treated with DHA-piperaquine (120-960mg), mefloquine (500mg) and DHA-piperaquine + mefloquine (120-960mg+500mg) and serial symptom questionnaires, biochemistry, full blood counts, pharmacokinetic profiles, and electrocardiographic (ECG) measurements were performed.Results: Fifteen healthy subjects were enrolled. There was no difference in the incidence or severity of adverse events between the three treatment arms. The slight prolongation in QTc interval associated with DHA-piperaquine administration did not increase after administration of DHA-piperaquine + mefloquine. The addition of mefloquine had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetic properties of piperaquine. However, co-administration of mefloquine significantly reduced the exposures to dihydroartemisinin; AUC [-22.6%; 90% CI (-33.1, -10.4), p=0.0039] and Cmax [-29.0%; 90% CI (-40.6, -15.1), p=0.0079].Conclusion: Mefloquine can be added safely to dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine in malaria treatment."

In these scenarios, biofilms are subjected to shear forces, but the mechanical integrity of these aggregates often prevents their disruption or dispersal. Their physical robustness is the result of the multiple bio-polymers secreted by constituent microbial cells which are also responsible for numerous biological functions. A better understanding of the role of these bio-polymers and their response to dynamic forces is therefore crucial for understanding the interplay between biofilm structure and function. In this manuscript, we review experimental techniques in rheology, which help quantify the viscoelasticity of biofilms, and modelling approaches from soft matter physics, that can assist our understanding of the rheological properties. We describe how these methods could be combined with synthetic biology approaches to control and investigate the effects of secreted polymers on the physical properties of biofilms. We argue that without an integrated approach of the three disciplines the links between genetics, composition and interaction of matrix biopolymers and the viscoelastic properties of biofilms will be much harder to uncover.",TonBm-PocAB system is required for maintenance of membrane integrity and polar position of flagella in Pseudomonas putida.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31182498,Journal of bacteriology,2019 06 11,"TonB-ExbB-ExbD-like energy transduction systems are widespread among Gram-negative bacteria. While most species have only one copy of tonB-exbBD genes, the Pseudomonas species possess more TonB-ExbBD homologues. One of them, the TonB3-PocA-PocB complex, was recently shown to be required for polar localization of FlhF, and thus the flagella in Pseudomonas aeruginosa Here, we show that the orthologous TonBm-PocA-PocB complex is important for polar localization of FlhF and flagella in Pseudomonas putida as well. Additionally, the system is necessary for maintaining membrane integrity as the inactivation of the TonBm-PocAB complex results in increased membrane permeability, lowered stress tolerance and conditional cell lysis. Interestingly, the functionality of TonBm-PocAB complex is more important for stationary than for exponentially growing bacteria. The whole-cell proteome analysis provided a likely explanation for this growth phase dependence, as extensive reprogramming was disclosed in exponentially growing tonBm deletion strain, while only few proteomic changes, mostly downregulation of outer membrane proteins, were determined in stationary phase ΔtonBm We propose that this response in exponential phase, involving, inter alia, activation of AlgU and ColR regulons, can compensate the TonBm-PocAB's deficiency, while stationary phase cells are unable to alleviate the lack of TonBm-PocAB. Our results suggest that mislocalization of flagella does not cause the membrane integrity problems; rather, the impaired membrane intactness of TonBm-PocAB deficient strain could be the reason for the random placement of flagella.IMPORTANCE The ubiquitous Pseudomonas species are well-adapted to survive in a wide variety of environments. Their success relies on their versatile metabolic, signaling and transport ability but also on their high intrinsic tolerance to various stress factors. This is why the study of the stress surviving mechanisms of Pseudomonas species is of utmost importance. The stress tolerance of Pseudomonads is mainly achieved through the high barrier property of their membranes. Here, we present evidence that the TonB-ExbBD-like TonBm-PocAB system is involved in maintaining the membrane homeostasis of Pseudomonas putida and its deficiency leads to lowered stress tolerance and conditional cell lysis.",From intracellular bacteria to differentiated bacteroids: transcriptome and metabolome analysis in Aeschynomene nodules using the Bradyrhizobium sp. ORS285 bclA mutant.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31182497,Journal of bacteriology,2019 06 11,"Soil bacteria called rhizobia trigger the formation of root nodules on legume plants. The rhizobia infect these symbiotic organs and adopt an intracellular lifestyle within the nodule cells where they differentiate into nitrogen-fixing bacteroids. Several legume lineages enforce their symbionts into an extreme cellular differentiation, comprising cell enlargement and genome endoreduplication. The antimicrobial peptide transporter BclA is a major determinant of this process in Bradyrhizobium sp. ORS285, a symbiont of Aeschynomene spp.. In the absence of BclA, the bacteria proceed until the intracellular infection of nodule cells but they cannot differentiate into enlarged polyploid and functional bacteroids. The bclA nodule bacteria constitute thus an intermediate stage between the free-living soil bacteria and the nitrogen-fixing bacteroids. Metabolomics on whole nodules of Aeschynomene afraspera and Aeschynomene indica infected with the wild type or the bclA mutant revealed 47 metabolites that differentially accumulated concomitantly with bacteroid differentiation. Bacterial transcriptome analysis of these nodules demonstrated that the intracellular settling of the rhizobia in the symbiotic nodule cells is accompanied with a first transcriptome switch involving several hundreds of upregulated and downregulated genes and a second switch accompanying the bacteroid differentiation, involving less genes but ones that are expressed to extremely elevated levels. The transcriptomes further suggested a dynamic role for oxygen and redox regulation of gene expression during nodule formation and a non-symbiotic function of BclA. Together, our data uncover the metabolic and gene expression changes that accompany the transition from intracellular bacteria into differentiated nitrogen-fixing bacteroids.ImportanceThe legume-rhizobium symbiosis is a major ecological process fueling the biogeochemical nitrogen cycle with reduced nitrogen. It represents also a promising strategy to cut down the use of chemical nitrogen fertilizers in agriculture, thereby improving its sustainability. This interaction leads to the intracellular accommodation of rhizobia within plant cells of symbiotic organs where they differentiate into nitrogen-fixing bacteroids. In specific legume clades, this differentiation process requires the bacterial transporter BclA to counteract antimicrobial peptides produced by the host. Transcriptome analysis of Bradyrhizobium wild-type and bclA mutant bacteria in culture and in symbiosis with Aeschynomene host plants dissected the bacterial transcriptional response in distinct phases and highlighted functions of the transporter in the free-living stage of the bacterial life cycle.",Cytotoxic curli intermediates form during Salmonella biofilm development.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31182496,Journal of bacteriology,2019 06 11,"Enterobacteriaceae produce amyloid proteins called curli that are the major proteinaceous component of biofilms. Amyloids are also produced by humans and are associated with diseases such as Alzheimer's. During the multi-step process of amyloid formation, monomeric subunits form oligomers, protofibrils, and finally mature fibrils. Amyloid β oligomers are more cytotoxic to cells than the mature amyloid fibrils. Oligomeric intermediates of curli have not been previously detected. We determined that turbulence inhibited biofilm formation, and that, intriguingly, curli aggregates purified from cultures grown under high-turbulence conditions were structurally smaller and contained less DNA than did curli preparations from cultures grown with less turbulence. Using flow cytometry analysis, we demonstrated that CsgA was expressed in cultures exposed to higher turbulence but that these cultures had lower levels of cell death than less turbulent cultures. Our data suggests that the DNA released during cell death drives the formation of larger fibrillar structures. Consistent with this idea, addition of exogenous genomic DNA increased the size of the curli intermediates and led to binding to Thioflavin T at levels observed with mature aggregates. Similar to the intermediate oligomers of amyloid β, intermediate curli aggregates were more cytotoxic than the mature curli fibrils when incubated with bone marrow-derived macrophages. The discovery of cytotoxic curli intermediates will enable research into the roles of amyloid intermediates in the pathogenesis of Salmonella and other bacteria that cause enteric infections.IMPORTANCE Amyloid proteins are the major proteinaceous components of biofilms, which are associated with up to 65% of human bacterial infections. Amyloids produced by human cells are also associated with diseases such as Alzheimer's. The amyloid monomeric subunits self-associate to form oligomers, protofibrils, and finally mature fibrils. Amyloid β oligomers are more cytotoxic to cells than the mature amyloid fibrils. Here we detected oligomeric intermediates of curli for the first time. Like the oligomers of amyloid β, intermediate curli fibrils were more cytotoxic than the mature curli fibrillar aggregates when incubated with bone marrow-derived macrophages. The discovery of cytotoxic curli intermediates will enable research into the roles of amyloid intermediates in the pathogenesis of Salmonella and other bacteria that cause enteric infections.",PhoP-mediated repression of the SPI1 T3SS in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31182495,Journal of bacteriology,2019 06 13,"Salmonella must rapidly adapt to various niches in the host during infection. Relevant virulence factors must be appropriately induced, and systems that are detrimental in a particular environment must be turned off. Salmonella infects intestinal epithelial cells using a type 3 secretion system (T3SS) encoded on Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 (SPI1). The system is controlled by three AraC-like regulators HilD, HilC, and RtsA, which form a complex feed forward loop to activate expression of hilA, encoding the main transcriptional regulator of T3SS structural genes. This system is tightly regulated, with many of the activating signals acting at the level of hilD translation or HilD protein activity. Once inside the phagosome of epithelial cells, or in macrophages during systemic stages of disease, the SPI1 T3SS is no longer required or expressed. Here we show that the PhoPQ two-component system, critical for intracellular survival, appears to be the primary mechanism by which Salmonella shuts down the SPI1 T3SS. PhoP negatively regulates hilA through multiple distinct mechanisms: direct transcriptional repression of the hilA promoter, indirect transcriptional repression of both the hilD and rtsA promoters, and activation of the sRNA PinT. Genetic analyses and electrophoretic mobility shift assays suggest that PhoP specifically binds the hilA promoter to block binding of activators HilD, HilC, and RtsA as a mechanism of repression.ImportanceSalmonella is one of the most common foodborne pathogens, causing an estimated 1.2 million illnesses per year in the US. A key step in infection is activation of the bacterial invasion machinery, which induces uptake of the bacterium into epithelial cells and leads to induction of inflammatory diarrhea. Upon entering the vacuolar compartments of host cells, Salmonella senses an environmental transition and represses the invasion machinery with a two-component system relevant for survival within the vacuole. This adaptation to specific host niches is an important example of how signals are integrated for survival of the pathogen.",Undetected Dysglycemia an Important Risk Factor for Two Common Diseases Myocardial Infarction and Periodontitis: A Report From the PAROKRANK Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31182493,Diabetes care,2019 06 11,"Information on the relationship among dysglycemia (prediabetes or diabetes), myocardial infarction (MI), and periodontitis (PD) is limited.

Degradation of elastin, a highly insoluble protein and a significant component of the lung structural matrix, generates proinflammatory molecules. Elastin fragments (EFs) have been detected in the serum of smokers with emphysema, and elastin-specific T cells have also been detected in the peripheral blood of smokers with emphysema. However, an animal model that could recapitulate T cell-specific autoimmune responses by initiating and sustaining inflammation in the lungs is lacking. In this study, we report an animal model of autoimmune emphysema mediated by the loss of tolerance to elastin. Mice immunized with a combination of human EFs plus rat EFs but not mouse EFs showed increased infiltration of innate and adaptive immune cells to the lungs and developed emphysema. We cloned and expanded mouse elastin-specific CD4+ T cells from the lung and spleen of immunized mice. Finally, we identified TCR sequences from the autoreactive T cell clones, suggesting possible pathogenic TCRs that can cause loss of immune tolerance against elastin. This new autoimmune model of emphysema provides a useful tool to examine the immunological factors that promote loss of immune tolerance to self.",Ryanodine Receptor 2 Contributes to Impaired Protein Localization in Cyclic Nucleotide-gated Channel Deficiency.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31182474,eNeuro,2019 06 11,"The photoreceptor cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channel plays a pivotal role in phototransduction and cellular calcium homeostasis. Mutations in the cone photoreceptor CNG channel subunits CNGA3 and CNGB3 are associated with achromatopsia and cone dystrophies. CNG channel deficiency leads to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-associated cone apoptosis, protein mislocalization, and ER calcium dysregulation. This work investigated the potential mechanisms of protein mislocalization associated with ER calcium dysregulation using Cnga3-/- mice lacking ER Ca2+ channel ryanodine receptor 2 (RyR2) specifically in cones. Deletion of Ryr2 improved outer segment (OS) localization of the cone proteins M-opsin, S-opsin, and cone phosphodiesterase subunit α' (PDE6C) and decreased inner segment localization. One-month-old Cnga3-/- mice showed approximately 30% of M-opsin, 55% of S-opsin, and 50% of PDE6C localized to the OS. Cnga3-/- mice with Ryr2 deletion at the same age showed almost 60% of M- opsin, 70% of S-opsin, and 70% of PDE6C localized to the OS. Deletion of Ryr2 nearly completely reversed elevations of the ER stress markers phospho-IRE1α and phospho-eIF2α and suppressed cone apoptosis. Consistent with the improved cone protein localization and reduced ER stress/cone apoptosis, cone survival was improved by deletion of Ryr2 The number of cones was increased by about 28% in 2-4 month-old Cnga3-/- mice with Ryr2 deletion, compared with age-matched Cnga3-/- mice. This work demonstrates a role of RyR2/ER calcium dysregulation in protein mislocalization, ER stress and cone death. The findings provide novel insights into the mechanisms of photoreceptor degeneration and support strategies targeting ER calcium regulation to manage retinal degeneration.Significance Statement The cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channel plays a pivotal role in phototransduction and photoreceptor calcium homeostasis. Mutations in the cone CNG channel subunits are associated with achromatopsia and cone dystrophies. CNG channel deficiency leads to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-associated cone apoptosis, protein mislocalization, and ER calcium dysregulation. This work demonstrates a role of ER Ca2+ channel ryanodine receptor 2 and ER calcium dysregulation in protein mislocalization and subsequent ER stress and cone cell death. The findings provide novel insights into the mechanisms of photoreceptor degeneration. Altered calcium signaling and ER stress-associated cell death are common throughout retinal degenerative diseases. Thus, strategies targeting ER calcium regulation may help treat or slow photoreceptor degeneration.",Nociceptor deletion of Tsc2 enhances axon regeneration by inducing a conditioning injury response in dorsal root ganglia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31182472,eNeuro,2019 06 11,"Neurons of the peripheral nervous system are able to regenerate injured axons, a process requiring significant cellular resources to establish and maintain long-distance growth. Genetic activation of mTORC1, a potent regulator of cellular metabolism and protein translation, improves axon regeneration of peripheral neurons by an unresolved mechanism. To gain insight into this process, we activated mTORC1 signaling in mouse nociceptors via genetic deletion of its negative regulator Tsc2. Perinatal deletion of Tsc2 in nociceptors enhanced initial axon growth after sciatic nerve crush, however by three days post-injury axon elongation rate became similar to controls. mTORC1 inhibition prior to nerve injury was required to suppress the enhanced axon growth. Gene expression analysis in purified nociceptors revealed that Tsc2-deficient nociceptors had increased activity of regeneration-associated transcription factors (RATFs), including cJun and Atf3, in the absence of injury. Additionally, nociceptor deletion of Tsc2 activated satellite glial cells and macrophages in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) in a similar manner to nerve injury. Surprisingly, these changes improved axon length but not percentage of initiating axons in dissociated cultures. The pro-regenerative environment in naïve DRG was recapitulated by AAV8-mediated deletion of Tsc2 in adult mice, suggesting that this phenotype does not result from a developmental effect. Consistently, AAV8-mediated Tsc2 deletion did not improve behavioral recovery after a sciatic nerve crush injury despite initially enhanced axon growth. Together, these data show that neuronal mTORC1 activation induces an incomplete pro-regenerative environment in the DRG that improves initial but not later axon growth after nerve injury.Significance Statement Long distance axon regeneration poses a significant hurdle to recovery following nervous system injury. Increased mTORC1 signaling improves axon regeneration, however the underlying mechanisms are incompletely understood. We activated neuronal mTORC1 signaling by genetically deleting Tsc2 in Nav1.8-positive neurons perinatally or by AAV8-mediated viral infection in adult mice and observed improved short- but not long-term axon regeneration after sciatic nerve injury. We suggest that Tsc2 deletion promotes initial but not later peripheral axon regeneration by upregulating expression of neuronal pro-regenerative genes and activating non-neuronal responses in the surrounding environment. Activating mTORC1 signaling in peripheral neurons may provide therapeutic benefit in circumstances with poor initial growth such as after spinal cord injury to the dorsal column or peripheral nerve repair.","SCO-267, a GPR40 full agonist, improves glycemic and body weight control in rat models of diabetes and obesity.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31182471,The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics,2019 06 12,"GPR40/FFA1 receptor is a G-protein-coupled receptor expressed in the pancreatic islets and enteroendocrine cells. Here, we report the pharmacological profiles of SCO-267, a novel full agonist of GPR40. Ca2+ signaling and insulin and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) secretion were evaluated in GPR40-expressing CHO, MIN6, and GLUTag cells. Hormone secretions and effects on fasting glucose were tested in rats. Single or repeated dosing effects were evaluated in N-STZ-1.5 rats, diet-induced obese (DIO) rats, and GPR40-knockout (Ffar1-/-) mice. Treatment with SCO-267 activated Gq signaling in both high- and low-FFAR1-expressing CHO cells, stimulated insulin secretion in MIN6 cells, and induced GLP-1 release in GLUTag cells. When administered to normal rats, SCO-267 increased insulin, glucagon, GLP-1, glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide, and peptide YY (PYY) secretions under non-fasting conditions. These results show the full agonistic property of SCO-267 against GPR40. Hypoglycemia was not induced in SCO-267-treated rats during the fasting condition. In diabetic N-STZ-1.5 rats, SCO-267 was highly effective in improving glucose tolerance in single and 2-week dosing studies. DIO rats treated with SCO-267 for 2 weeks showed elevated plasma GLP-1 and PYY levels, reduced food intake, and decreased body weight. In wild-type mice, SCO-267 induced GLP-1 secretion, food intake inhibition, and body weight reduction; however, these effects were abolished in Ffar1-/- mice, indicating a GPR40-dependent mechanism. In conclusion, SCO-267 stimulated islet and gut hormone secretion, improved glycemic control in diabetic rats, and decreased body weight in obese rats. These data suggest the therapeutic potential of SCO-267 for the treatment of diabetes and obesity.",Elevated serum preptin concentrations in patients with diabetic nephropathy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31182468,Journal of investigative medicine : the official publication of the American Federation for Clinical Research,2019 06 11,"Preptin is a peptide synthesized and secreted accompanied with insulin from pancreatic β cells. Here, we tested the hypothesis that serum preptin concentrations are correlated with diabetic nephropathy (DN). Our study was performed in a population of 234 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and 78 healthy subjects. Patients with T2DM were divided into three groups: normoalbuminuria group (DN0, n=106), microalbuminuria group (DN1, n=90), and macroalbuminuria group (DN2, n=38) according to urine albumin to creatinine ratio (ACR). Serum preptin concentrations were significantly increased in the three T2DM subgroups than those in the controls. DN2 group showed significantly higher serum preptin concentrations compared with DN0 and DN1 groups. Moreover, DN1 group had higher serum preptin concentrations than DN0 group. Serum preptin was correlated with a higher risk of T2DM and DN after logistic regression analysis. Simply linear regression analysis demonstrated a positive correlation between serum preptin and gender, body mass index (BMI), blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, ACR, and a negative correlation between serum preptin and glomerular filtration rate, metformin, acarbose treatment. Gender, BMI, and ACR were still positively correlated with serum preptin after multiple linear regression analysis.

Subsequently the diabetic atherosclerosis rat model was established, the survived rats were divided into: NC, miR-15a-5p mimic, miR-15a-5p inhibitor, sh-FASN and miR-15a-5p + sh-FASN groups. Then a series of experiments were performed to examine the degree of atherosclerosis in each group. The results revealed that compared with the NC group, expressions of CRP, IL-6, ICAM1 in rat arterial tissue, the levels of LDL-C, BG, TG, TC and Hcy in rat serum, were increased after inhibiting miR-15a-5p, while the level of HDL-C was decreased and the fat storage area was enlarged after this treatment ( P <0.05) . In the miR-15a-5p mimic and sh-FASN groups, serum HDL-C levels were increased and the fat storage areas in arteries were reduced. The levels of CRP, IL-6, ICAM1 in rat arterial tissue, along with the levels of LDL-C, BG, TG, TC and Hcy in rat serum, were decreased ( P <0.05). HE staining and TEM results showed AS lesions be apparent in the arteries of rats in both the NC and miR-15a-5p inhibitor groups, but that in miR-15a-5p and sh-FASN group were improved, the miR-15a-5p mimic + sh-FASN group showed the most obvious improvement. Thus, miR-15a-5p alleviates the inflammation response and arterial injury in diabetic AS rats by targeting FASN.",The impact of pediatric emergency department crowding on patient and health care system outcomes: a multicentre cohort study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31182457,CMAJ : Canadian Medical Association journal = journal de l'Association medicale canadienne,2019 06 11,Emergency department overcrowding has been associated with increased odds of hospital admission and mortality after discharge from the emergency department in predominantly adult cohorts.

Here we report the proteomic analyses of a wild-type Sulfolobus islandicus strain and its mutant derivative strains lacking either a homologue of the protein acetyltransferase Pat (ΔSisPat) or a homologue of the Nt-acetyltransferase Ard1 (ΔSisArd1). A total of 1,708 N&epsilon;-acetylated lysine residues in 684 proteins (26% of the total proteins), and 158 Nt-acetylated proteins (44% of the identified proteins) were found in S. islandicus ΔSisArd1 grew more slowly than the parental strain, whereas ΔSisPat showed no significant growth defects. Only 24 out of the 1,503 quantifiable N&epsilon;-acetylated lysine residues were differentially acetylated, and all but one of the 24 residues were less acetylated, by >1.3 fold in ΔSisPat than in the parental strain, indicating the narrow substrate specificity of the enzyme. Six acyl-CoA synthetases were the preferred substrates of SisPat in vivo, suggesting that N&epsilon;-acetylation by the acetyltransferase is involved in maintaining metabolic balance in the cell. Acetylation of acyl-CoA synthetases by SisPat occurred at a sequence motif conserved among all three domains of life. On the other hand, 92% of the acetylated N-termini identified were acetylated by SisArd1 in the cell. The enzyme exhibited broad substrate specificity and was capable of modifying nearly all types of the target N-termini of human NatA-NatF. The deletion of the SisArd1 gene altered the cellular levels of 18% of the quantifiable proteins (1,518) by >1.5 fold.

It is important to accurately identify genuine cases of PTSD and, as part of the differential diagnosis, to rule out instances of false PTSD. False PTSD diagnoses can adversely affect treatment planning, resource management, and research. The subjective nature of stressors, stereotypic presentation of symptoms, wealth of resources detailing how to malinger PTSD, and the high stakes for individuals involved in criminal, civil, and disability evaluations create challenges for making an accurate diagnosis. This article presents a systematic approach to help clinicians and forensic evaluators distinguish genuine PTSD from false variants of the disorder. It describes the types of false PTSD to be considered as alternative diagnoses, including malingered PTSD (for external gain, such as receiving a disability pension or evading criminal consequences), factitious PTSD (for internal gain, such as assuming the victim or hero/veteran role), and misattributed PTSD (legitimate psychopathology misdiagnosed as PTSD).

The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to investigate these factors.,Pathophysiological role of respiratory dysbiosis in hospital-acquired pneumonia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31182406,The Lancet. Respiratory medicine,2019 06 11,"Hospital-acquired pneumonia is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. The incidence of hospital-acquired pneumonia remains high globally and treatment can often be ineffective. Here, we review the available data and unanswered questions surrounding hospital-acquired pneumonia, discuss alterations of the respiratory microbiome and of the mucosal immunity in patients admitted to hospital, and explore potential approaches to stratify patients for tailored treatments. The lungs have been considered a sterile organ for decades because microbiological culture techniques had shown negative results. Culture-independent techniques have shown that healthy lungs harbour a diverse and dynamic ecosystem of bacteria, changing our comprehension of respiratory physiopathology. Understanding dysbiosis of the respiratory microbiome and altered mucosal immunity in patients with critical illness holds great promise to develop targeted host-directed immunotherapy to reduce ineffective treatment, to improve patient outcomes, and to tackle the global threat of resistant bacteria that cause these infections.",The European Society of Paediatric Oncology Ependymoma-II program Core-Plus model: Development and initial implementation of a cognitive test protocol for an international brain tumour trial.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31182404,European journal of paediatric neurology : EJPN : official journal of the European Paediatric Neurology Society,2019 06 11,"It is increasingly accepted that survival alone is an inadequate measure of the success of childhood brain tumour treatments. Consequently, there is growing emphasis on capturing quality of survival. Ependymomas are the third most frequently occurring brain tumours in childhood and present significant clinical challenges. European Society of Paediatric Oncology Ependymoma II is a comprehensive international program aiming to evaluate outcomes under different treatment regimens and improve diagnostic accuracy. Importantly, there has been agreement to lower the age at which children with posterior fossa ependymoma undergo focal irradiation from three years to either eighteen months or one year of age. Hitherto radiotherapy in Europe had been reserved for children over three years due to concerns over adverse cognitive outcomes following irradiation of the developing brain. There is therefore a duty of care to include longitudinal cognitive follow-up and this has been agreed as an essential trial outcome. Discussions between representatives of 18 participating European countries over 10 years have yielded European consensus for an internationally accepted test battery for follow-up of childhood ependymoma survivors. The 'Core-Plus' model incorporates a two-tier approach to assessment by specifying core tests to establish a minimum dataset where resources are limited, whilst maintaining scope for comprehensive assessment where feasible. The challenges leading to the development of the Core-Plus model are presented alongside learning from the initial stages of the trial. We propose that this model could provide a solution for future international trials addressing both childhood brain tumours and other conditions associated with cognitive morbidity."

To assess the localizing and lateralizing value of palpitation aura in focal epilepsy, we retrospectively analyzed the demography, electroclinical, neuroimaging, surgical, pathology data, and outcomes of 114 patients with focal epilepsy and the palpitation aura occurrence in relation to epileptogenic (temporal vs extratemporal, left vs right) origin. Out of 114 patients (mean age, 23.44 ± 9.69 years), 17 (14.9%) patients experienced palpitation as the first aura. Twelve had temporal, one had parietal, one had occipital lobe, and three had multiple lobes junction onset seizures. Palpitation aura was observed more frequently in temporal epilepsy: 22.2% of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and 8.3% of extratemporal lobe epilepsy (EX-TLE) exhibited palpitation aura (p = 0.038). However, palpitation aura had no difference between the left or right side: 16.4% with right-sided epilepsy and 13.2% with left-sided epilepsy exhibited palpitation aura (p = 0.634). Thus, our study suggested that palpitation was a frequent aura in patients with focal epilepsy. It is more commonly seen with temporal lobe origin, but it has no lateralizing value.","Ayahuasca, an ancient substance with traditional and contemporary use in neuropsychiatry and neuroscience.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31182391,Epilepsy & behavior : E&B,2019 06 11,"Ayahuasca is a botanical hallucinogenic preparation traditionally used for ritual and therapeutic purposes by native populations of the Northwestern Amazon.

Some specimens of this species were found in a cave in the municipality of Nobres, state of Mato Grosso. The specific identification of this population was confirmed by means of morphology and molecular biology. The mitochondrial 16S rDNA partial sequence of this species from Nobres has been deposited in GenBank (MK158949). The objective of this study was to elucidate the biology of O. fonsecai from Nobres, and to report autogeny in this tick population. Along three laboratory generations was observed molting of first nymphal instar to the second instar without feeding, a typical behavior of species included in the subgenus Alectorobius. The first generation (F1) presented five nymphal instars (N1 to N5), and most of adults emerged through molting of N5. The last nymphal instar of second generation (F2) was N4, but most of adults emerged from N3. In the third generation (F3) the last nymphal instar was N5, with most of the adults emerging from N4. In F2, some females (n = 20) originated from N3 began laying eggs without a blood meal. It was observed that those N3 fed twice before they molted to autogenic females. However, autogenic behavior occurred in relation to third generation females (F3) with specimens originating from N4 (n = 12) that were fed only once as nymphs. This behavior has already been reported as obligatory for the genera Otobius and Antricola, while it is facultative for one species of genus Argas and for four species of genus Ornithodoros. However, the present report provides the first record of facultative autogeny for a species of Ornithodoros in Brazil."

These Global Vascular Guidelines (GVG) are focused on definition, evaluation, and management of CLTI with the goals of improving evidence-based care and highlighting critical research needs. The term CLTI is preferred over critical limb ischemia, as the latter implies threshold values of impaired perfusion rather than a continuum. CLTI is a clinical syndrome defined by the presence of peripheral artery disease (PAD) in combination with rest pain, gangrene, or a lower limb ulceration >2 weeks duration. Venous, traumatic, embolic, and nonatherosclerotic etiologies are excluded. All patients with suspected CLTI should be referred urgently to a vascular specialist. Accurately staging the severity of limb threat is fundamental, and the Society for Vascular Surgery Threatened Limb Classification system, based on grading of Wounds, Ischemia, and foot Infection (WIfI) is endorsed. Objective hemodynamic testing, including toe pressures as the preferred measure, is required to assess CLTI. Evidence-based revascularization (EBR) hinges on three independent axes: Patient risk, Limb severity, and ANatomic complexity (PLAN). Average-risk and high-risk patients are defined by estimated procedural and 2-year all-cause mortality. The GVG proposes a new Global Anatomic Staging System (GLASS), which involves defining a preferred target artery path (TAP) and then estimating limb-based patency (LBP), resulting in three stages of complexity for intervention. The optimal revascularization strategy is also influenced by the availability of autogenous vein for open bypass surgery. Recommendations for EBR are based on best available data, pending level 1 evidence from ongoing trials. Vein bypass may be preferred for average-risk patients with advanced limb threat and high complexity disease, while those with less complex anatomy, intermediate severity limb threat, or high patient risk may be favored for endovascular intervention. All patients with CLTI should be afforded best medical therapy including the use of antithrombotic, lipid-lowering, antihypertensive, and glycemic control agents, as well as counseling on smoking cessation, diet, exercise, and preventive foot care. Following EBR, long-term limb surveillance is advised. The effectiveness of nonrevascularization therapies (eg, spinal stimulation, pneumatic compression, prostanoids, and hyperbaric oxygen) has not been established. Regenerative medicine approaches (eg, cell, gene therapies) for CLTI should be restricted to rigorously conducted randomizsed clinical trials. The GVG promotes standardization of study designs and end points for clinical trials in CLTI.

A multidisciplinary update.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31182331,Journal of infection and chemotherapy : official journal of the Japan Society of Chemotherapy,2019 06 11,"Abdominal aortic graft infections (AGIs) occur in 1-5% of aortic prosthetic placements. It can result in limb amputation, pseudo-aneurysm formation, septic emboli, aorto-enteric fistulae, septic shock and death. The most frequently involved pathogens are methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci, followed by Enterobacteriaceae and uncommon bacteria. In case of gut involvement the presence of fungi has to be considered. Computed tomography angiography is actually the gold standard diagnostic imaging but magnetic resonance is a valid alternative. Nuclear medicine imaging is commonly used to improve sensitivity and specificity. Signs and symptoms are often aspecific and blood cultures can be negative, requiring alternative ways to detect the microorganism responsible for infection, such as 16S rRNA gene sequencing and molecular rapid diagnostic tests. Curative surgical intervention is the first choice approach, with in-situ reconstruction providing by far the best outcome and xenopericardial bovine patch as a promising option. For patients unable to undergo major surgery, the outcome of conservative approach remains uncertain but usually provides for life-long suppressive therapy. However, in selected cases an attempt of stopping antibiotic treatment after 3-6 months can be done.

This committee report presents our recommendations on ASTs based on an analysis of the nationwide survey on implemented ASPs and staff FTEs at 1358 healthcare facilities conducted by the Japanese Society of Chemotherapy. Our report provides a directive for structural and financial support of ASTs and should aid in planning for the enhancement of AST practices and the organization of new ASTs."

However, each technique, if applied incorrectly or in ignorance, can lead to difficulties in execution or errors in interpretation. In this review of commonly used molecular diagnostic tests, including immunohistochemistry, microsatellite instability testing, chromosomal microarray testing, and conventional and next-generation sequencing, the emphasis will be on potential pitfalls and considerations for each platform.

Many individuals propose that these facilities can help alleviate the stress our current emergency care system faces and provide care to people with limited access to traditional hospital-based EDs. We reviewed the current literature on freestanding EDs to investigate whether these facilities are meeting those goals. We found that although they provide care that is generally similar in quality and cost to that of hospital-based EDs, freestanding EDs tend to cater to a more affluent patient population that already has access to health care instead of expanding care to underserved areas. This, coupled with a fragmented system of state-by-state regulation, leads us to recommend implementing more uniform licensing criteria from state to state, encouraging freestanding EDs to operate in more rural and underserved areas, and increasing price transparency.",Pulmonary Complications of Opioid Overdose Treated With Naloxone.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31182316,Annals of emergency medicine,2019 06 11,We aim to determine whether administration of higher doses of naloxone for the treatment of opioid overdose is associated with increased pulmonary complications.,"6,6'-Dihydroxythiobinupharidine as a poison of human type II topoisomerases.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31182315,Bioorganic & medicinal chemistry letters,2019 06 11,"A number of natural products with medicinal properties increase DNA cleavage mediated by type II topoisomerases. In an effort to identify additional natural compounds that affect the activity of human type II topoisomerases, a blind screen of a library of 341 Mediterranean plant extracts was conducted. Extracts from Nuphar lutea, the yellow water lily, were identified in this screen. N. lutea has been used in traditional medicine by a variety of indigenous populations. The active compound in N. lutea, 6,6'-dihydroxythiobinupharidine, was found to enhance DNA cleavage mediated by human topoisomerase IIα and IIβ ∼8-fold and ∼3-fold, respectively. Mechanistic studies with topoisomerase IIα indicate that 6,6'-dihydroxythiobinupharidine is a ""covalent poison"" that acts by adducting the enzyme outside of the DNA cleavage-ligation active site and requires the N-terminal domain of the protein for its activity. Results suggest that some of the medicinal properties of N. lutea may result from the interactions between 6,6'-dihydroxythiobinupharidine and the human type II enzymes.",Clinical impact of gastroesophageal reflux disease in patients with subacute/chronic cough.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31182314,Allergology international : official journal of the Japanese Society of Allergology,2019 06 11,"While gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is one of the commonest causes of subacute/chronic cough along with cough-variant asthma (CVA) and rhinosinusitis, its clinical impact remains unknown.

Experiments were carried out in rabbits at the Physiological Institute headed by Siegmund von Exner-Ewarten in Vienna to investigate the central pathways of chewing and swallowing. After placing cortical lesions, Economo applied cortical and subcortical electrical stimulation to obtain masticatory movements, and tracked degenerated fibers by means of the Marchi method. He traced fibers through the internal capsule, ventral nucleus of the thalamus, subthalamic nucleus, substantia nigra and its connections with the motor nucleus of the trigeminal nerve, and nucleus solitarius. He suggested that the substantia nigra is responsible for coordinating alimentation movements, with the involvement of cranial nerves V, VII, IX and X as well. We discuss these findings in a historical and a modern perspective, including the concept of a central pattern generator in the pontine reticular formation and its interaction with the nucleus solitarius. Today we understand that mastication is a voluntary action controlled by motor cortical areas, by motoneurons of the trigeminal, and by a neural pattern generator in the pons. On the other hand, deglutition comprises 'reflex swallowing' triggered by sensory fibers of cranial nerves V, IX and X, and 'voluntary swallowing' which may be controlled by both cortical fields and subcortical areas, such as the internal capsule, the hypothalamus and the mesencephalic reticular formation.",Arterial ischemic stroke in non-neonate children: Diagnostic and therapeutic specificities.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31182310,Revue neurologique,2019 06 11,"Pediatric arterial ischemic stroke (AIS) is a severe condition, with long-lasting devastating consequences on motor and cognitive abilities, academic and social inclusion, and global life projects.

A,2019 06 11,"Flame retardants have evoked public concerns owing to their extensive usage in consumer products and potential adverse effects on human health. In this study, a rapid and sensitive solid-phase extraction-ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (SPE-UPLC-MS/MS) method was developed to determine hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD), tetrabromobisphenol-A (TBBPA), six bromophenols (BPs), and nine organophosphate flame retardants (OPFRs) in water. Because of the differences in elution conditions and ionization modes for group 1 (HBCD, TBBPA, and the BPs) and group 2 (OPFRs), we had to run them twice under the different conditions to analyse group 1 and group 2 using UPLC-MS/MS. The method detection limits were 0.1-2.5 ng/L, linearity range was 0.1-100.0 ng/L for group 1 (HBCD, TBBPA, and the BPs). The method detection limit was 0.10 ng/L, and the linearity range was 0.25-250 ng/L for the OPFRs. First, the pH values of the water samples were adjusted to the range of 2-3. Then, the acidified water samples were extracted by hydrophilic-lipophilic-balance solid phase extraction (HLB-SPE) cartridges, which were eluted with 12 mL of acetonitrile. Finally, the recoveries of HBCD, TBBPA, and the BPs were 76.2-98.1%, and the relative standard deviations (RSDs, n = 5) were 2.0-28.5%. Regarding the OPFRs, the recoveries were 72.4-110.3%, and the RSDs were 0.6-6.9%. The stability experiment showed that the concentration differences were less than 15%, meeting the requirement for quality control samples. This proposed method was successfully applied to surface water, ground water, raw water, finished water, tap water, and bottled water samples.",An improved peak clustering algorithm for comprehensive two-dimensional liquid chromatography data analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31182307,Journal of chromatography. A,2019 06 11,"In this work, an improved algorithm was developed for two-dimensional (2D) peak detection in complex two-dimensional liquid chromatography (LC×LC) data sets. In the first step, conventional one-dimensional peak detection was performed. In the second step, retention time, bidirectional overlap and unimodality criteria were applied to decide which of the individual peaks should be merged. To improve the peak detection with LC×LC analysis using shifting second dimension (2D) gradients, the variable thresholds, which permitted different thresholds for candidate peaks at different first dimension (1D) retention times, were employed for examination of the 2D retention time differences. Furthermore, the bidirectional overlap criterion performed at specified height was recommended to improve detection for tailing peaks. The developed algorithm was further tested on data sets from different LC×LC analyses of a complex peptide mixture, and then quantitatively evaluated by comparison between the results by the algorithm and mass analysis. Evidently improved performance with an accuracy rate over 60% was obtained by the algorithm, even for peak detection with LC×LC analysis under relatively low 1D sampling frequency or shifting 2D gradients. This would help to improve LC×LC quantitative analysis and performance assessment."

Infectious diseases,2019 06 11,"In high-income countries, the presentation of tuberculosis is changing, primarily because of migration, and understanding the specific health needs of susceptible populations is becoming increasingly important. Although disseminated tuberculosis is well documented in HIV-positive patients, the disease is poorly described and less expected in HIV-negative individuals. In this Grand Round, we report eight HIV-negative refugees, who presented with extensively disseminated tuberculosis. We discuss the multifactorial causes, such as deprivations during long journeys, precarious living conditions, and the experience of violence, which might add to nutritional factors and chronic disorders, eventually resulting in a state of predisposition to immune deficiency. We also show that disseminated tuberculosis is often difficult to diagnose when pulmonary symptoms are absent. Communication difficulties between refugees and health-care workers are another major hurdle, and every effort should be made to get a valid patient history. This medical history is crucial to guide imaging and other diagnostic procedures to establish a definite diagnosis, which should be confirmed by a positive tuberculosis culture. Because many of these patients are at risk for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, drug susceptibility testing is imperative to guide therapy. In the absence of treatment guidelines for this entity, clinicians can determine treatment duration according to recommendations provided for extrapulmonary tuberculosis and affected organs. Paradoxical expansion of tuberculous lesions during therapy should be treated with corticosteroids. In many cases, treatment duration must be individualised and might even exceed 12 months.",The Dandelion Dilemma Revisited for Oligoprogression: Treat the Whole Lawn or Weed Selectively?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31182289,Clinical oncology (Royal College of Radiologists (Great Britain)),2019 06 11,"Oligoprogressive disease is a relatively new clinical concept describing progression at only a few sites of metastasis in patients with otherwise controlled widespread disease. In the era of well-tolerated targeted treatments, resistance inevitably occurs and overcoming this is a challenge. Local ablative therapy for oligoprogressive disease may allow the continuation of systemic treatments by overcoming the few sub-clones that have developed resistance. Stereotactic body radiotherapy is now frequently used in treating oligometastatic disease using ablative doses with minimally invasive techniques and acceptable toxicity. We discuss the current retrospective clinical evidence base supporting the use of local ablative therapy for oligoprogression in metastatic patients on targeted treatments within multiple tumour sites. As there is currently a lack of published prospective data available, the best management for these patients remains unclear.

The age-adjusted annual incidence of CNS tumours is reportedly low; however, there is substantial global variability in its incidence, with nearly a five-fold difference between regions with the highest rates in developed countries in the West and those with the lowest rates in developing countries in South-East Asia, including India, possibly attributable to key differences in environmental factors, genetic susceptibilities and cultural practices, as well as resource constraints in low-middle income countries precluding precise ascertainment and accurate diagnosis. The burden of CNS tumours is further compounded by the fact that they require highly specialised and skilled multidisciplinary care, including access to modern neuroimaging, neurosurgery, neuropathology and molecular biology, radiotherapy, chemotherapy and rehabilitation services, which may not be widely available in an integrated manner in large parts of the world with a large variation in clinical pathways, non-uniformity of care and resultant heterogeneity in clinical outcomes. CNS tumours encompass a heterogeneous spectrum of histopathological entities with differences in presentation, distinct molecular/genetic alterations, diverse biological behaviour and varying clinical outcomes. Survival is highly dependent on histology, grade and molecular biology, but varies widely across continents, even for the same tumour type and grade. In general, survival is higher in children with primary brain tumours than in adults, largely due to the differences in histological distribution across age groups. However, there is widespread variability, with 5-year survival for paediatric brain tumours being <40% in some low-middle income countries compared with 70-80% in the developed world.

CagW forms multimer and its absence affects cellular levels of pilus forming components, CagL, CagI and CagH. Our results support the notion that the protein is essential for the transport of CagA across the bacterial membrane barrier and would aid in improving our understanding of structural and functional aspects of the inner membrane part of Cag-T4SS channel complex for the passage of substrate CagA.",ACAP4 interacts with CrkII to promote the recycling of integrin β1.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31182282,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2019 06 11,"ACAP4, a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for the ADP-ribosylation factor 6 (ARF6), plays import roles in cell migration, cell polarity, vesicle trafficking and tumorigenesis. Similarly, the ubiquitously expressed adaptor protein CrkII functions in a wide range of cellular activities, including cell proliferation, T cell adhesion and activation, tumorigenesis, and bacterial pathogenesis. Here, we demonstrate that ACAP4 physically interacts with CrkII. Biochemical experiments revealed that ACAP4550-660 and the SH3N domain of CrkII are responsible for the interaction. Functional characterization showed that the interaction is required for the recruitment of ACAP4 to the plasma membrane where ACAP4 functions to regulate the recycling of the signal transducer integrin β1. Thus, we suggest that the CrkII-ACAP4 complex may be involved in regulation of cell adhesion.",Conversion of human fibroblasts into functional Leydig-like cells by small molecules and a single factor.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31182281,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2019 06 11,"Reprogramming fibroblasts into Leydig cells (LCs) offers a promising source for cell-based therapy for male hypogonadism.

In this study, the anti-bacterial activities of synthetic Mozambique tilapia GRN-41 peptide (OmGRN-41) against various bacterial pathogens were investigated. The results showed that OmGRN-41 had bactericidal activity against Vibrio species, including V. vulnificus, V. alginolyticus, and V. harveyi, but exhibited bacteriostatic activity against V. parahaemolyticus. OmGRN-41 maintained bactericidal activity (64 μM) against V. vulnificus at pH 2 to pH 10 or after heat treatment for 1 h at high temperatures between 40 °C and 100 °C. TEM observations revealed that the outer membrane of V. vulnificus was disrupted by OmGRN-41, leading to morphological rupture and loss of cytoplasmic contents. Additionally, little hemolytic activity against tilapia and sheep erythrocytes was detected after treatment with 128 μM OmGRN-41. OmGRN-41 can effectively enhance the survival of Nile tilapia infected by V. vulnificus. Our results suggest that the OmGRN-41 is a novel antimicrobial peptide possessing bactericidal activity, especially against Vibrio species. These results indicate that OmGRN-41 can be applied in human Vibriosis treatment and has the potential to defend against Vibrio spp. infection in critical aquaculture organisms.",The structure of the checkpoint clamp 9-1-1 complex and clamp loader Rad24-RFC in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31182279,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2019 06 11,"The 9-1-1 complex is a circular heterotrimeric complex composed of Rad9-Hus1-Rad1.

The C-terminal of Ddc1/Rad9 is critical for checkpoint activation. However, there is little structural information about the intact 9-1-1 complex and the interaction with Rad24-RFC. Here, we determined the structure of the intact 9-1-1 complex in S. cerevisiae by cryo-Electron Microscopy (cryo-EM) and identified the Ddc1 C-tail module for the first time. We found that the C-terminal of Ddc1 has structural flexibility and it plays a critical role for Mec1/Ddc2 activation in G1/G2 phase. At the same time, we got a glimpse of the structure of Rad24-RFC and captured the interaction between the 9-1-1 complex and Rad24-RFC. The structural information greatly helped us to understand the process of clamp-loading."

Biotechnological interest in this species has increased due to its use, among others, in the generation of transgenic animals for use in biomedicine based on its greater physiological proximity to the human species than other large domestic animals. This development has paralleled an improvement in Assisted Reproduction Techniques (ART) used for this species. However, the ability to generate animals from embryos produced entirely in vitro is still limited and a wide margin for improvement remains. Here we review the procedures, additives, and devices used during pig in vitro fertilization (IVF), focusing on the main points of each step that have offered the best results in terms of increased efficiency of the system. The lack of standardized protocols and consensus on the parameters to be assessed makes it difficult to compare results across different studies, but some conclusions are drawn from the literature. We anticipate that new physiological protocols will advance the field of swine IVF, including induction of prefertilization ZP hardening with oviductal fluid, sperm preparation by swim-up method, increased viscosity through the addition of inert molecules or reproductive biofluids, and the incorporation of 3D devices. Here we also reflect on the need to expand the variables on which the efficiency of pig IVF is based, providing new parameters that should be considered to supply more objective and quantitative assessment of IVF additives and protocols.",Transition Readiness in Adolescents and Young Adults with Heart Disease: Can We Improve Quality of Life?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31182220,The Journal of pediatrics,2019 06 11,We previously reported common knowledge deficits and lack of transition readiness in 13- 25-year-olds with congenital or acquired heart disease.

We sought to evaluate the incidence and outcomes of GIB in STEMI patients using a nationwide database. We identified adults admitted with STEMI between in the National Inpatient Sample (2003 to 2016), and compared the morbidity, mortality, resource utilization, and cost in patients with and without GIB. We assessed rates of endoscopy referral and its associated with mortality. Among 1,450,696 weighted STEMI hospitalizations, 32,624 (2.2%) were complicated with GIB. Patients with GIB were older, and had distinctive characteristics compared to those without GIB. Older age, cardiogenic shock; history of peptic ulcer disease, cirrhosis, anemia, or alcohol use disorder were the strongest predictors of GIB during STEMI hospitalizations. In-hospital mortality was higher in the GIB group (28.2% vs 11.1%, p <0.001). The excess mortality associated with GIB persisted after propensity-score matching, and in sensitivity analyses excluding patients who underwent coronary intervention >24-hours after admission, and those transferred to another hospital. Post-STEMI GIB was associated with more strokes and acute kidney injury, longer hospitalizations, and higher cost. In a logistic regression analysis, GIB was independently associated with mortality (odds ratios [OR] 1.91, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.85 to 1.97, p <0.001). There was a correlation between undergoing endoscopy and lower in-hospital mortality (unadjusted OR 0.27; 95% CI, 0.24 to 0.29; adjusted-OR 0.30; 95% CI, 0.27 to 0.33; p <0.001). In conclusion, GIB complicating STEMI is uncommon but is associated with excess morbidity, mortality, resource utilization and cost.

Such organization is often assumed to be reflective of the human past, emerging as human cognition and communication evolved through earlier fission-fusion social processes, typical of many primate social systems. We review the history of this assumption in light of recent empirical data of co-residence and social networks among contemporary hunter-gatherers. We suggest that while residential and foraging groups are often small, there is little evidence that these groups are drawn from small communities nested within small-scale societies. Most mobile hunter-gatherers live in groups dominated by links between non-relatives, where residential group membership is fluid and supports large-scale social networks of interaction. We investigate these dynamics with fine-grained observational data on Martu foraging groups and social organization in Australia's Western Desert. The composition of Martu foraging groups is distinct from that of residential groups, although both are dominated by ties between individuals who have no close biological relationships. The number of individuals in a foraging group varies with habitat quality, but in a dynamic way, as group size is shaped by ecological legacies of land use. The flexible size and composition of foraging groups link individuals across their ""estates"": spatially explicit storehouses of ritual and relational wealth, inherited across generations through maintaining expansive networks of social interaction in a large and complex society. We propose that human cognition is tied to development of such expansive social relationships and co-evolved with dynamic socio-ecological interactions expressed in large-scale networks of relational wealth.","New bracketing luminescence ages constrain the Sima de los Huesos hominin fossils (Atapuerca, Spain) to MIS 12.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31182208,Journal of human evolution,2019 06 11,"Recent chronological studies of the Sima de los Huesos (SH) hominin fossil site, Atapuerca, Spain, have established a close minimum age of at least 430 ka for sedimentary material immediately overlying the human remains. However, a firm maximum age limit still needs to be established for the SH fossils in order to better constrain the timing for the onset of Neandertal speciation. In the present study, we address this important chronological gap at SH by providing direct ages for the sediment deposits that host, and immediately underlie, the hominin fossils. Depositional ages were obtained using single-grain thermally-transferred optically stimulated luminescence (TT-OSL), a technique that has yielded reliable 'extended-range' luminescence chronologies at several independently dated Atapuerca sites. Four single-grain TT-OSL depositional ages of 453 ± 56 ka, 437 ± 38 ka, 457 ± 41 ka and 460 ± 39 ka were obtained for the red clay lithostratigraphic units (LU-5 and LU-6) found underlying and encasing the SH hominin bones. A Bayesian age-depth model was constructed using previously published chronologies, as well as the new single-grain TT-OSL ages for LU-5 and LU-6, in order to derive combined age estimates for individual lithostratigraphic units preserved at SH. The combined modeled ranges reveal that the hominin-bearing layer (LU-6) was deposited between 455 ± 17 ka and 440 ± 15 ka (mean lower and upper boundary 68.2% probability range ± 1σ uncertainty, respectively), with a mean age of 448 ± 15 ka. These new bracketing ages suggest that the hominin fossils at SH were most likely deposited within Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 12, enabling more precise temporal constraint on the early evolution of the Neandertal lineage. The SH fossils represent the oldest reliably dated hominin remains displaying Neandertal features across Eurasia. These Neandertal features are first observed in the facial skeleton, including the mandible and teeth, as well as the temporomandibular joint, and appear consistently across the SH collection. Our chronological findings suggest that the appearance of these Neandertal traits may have been associated with the climatic demise of MIS 12 and the ecological changes that occurred in Iberia during this period. Other Middle Pleistocene hominin fossils from Europe dated to MIS 12-11, or later, show different morphological trends, with some lacking Neandertal specializations. The latest SH dating results enable improved temporal correlations with these contrasting hominin records from Europe, and suggest a complex picture for hominin evolution during the Middle Pleistocene."

K2P13.1 (THIK-1) channels are expressed in the human heart, and atrial K2P13.1 levels are reduced in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) or heart failure. The first objective of this study was to investigate acute effects of antiarrhythmic drugs on human K2P13.1 currents. Second, we assessed atrial K2P13.1 remodeling in AF pigs to validate the porcine model for future translational evaluation of K2P13.1-based antiarrhythmic concepts. K2P13.1 protein expression was studied in domestic pigs during AF induced by atrial burst pacing. AF was associated with 66% reduction of K2P13.1 levels in the right atrium at 21-day follow-up. Voltage clamp electrophysiology was employed to elucidate human K2P13.1 channel pharmacology in Xenopus oocytes. Propafenone (-26%; 100 μM), mexiletine (-75%; 1.5 mM), propranolol (-38%; 200 μM), and lidocaine (-59%; 100 μM) significantly inhibited K2P13.1 currents. By contrast, K2P13.1 channels were not markedly affected by quinidine, carvedilol, metoprolol, amiodarone and verapamil. Concentration-dependent K2P13.1 blockade by mexiletine occurred rapidly with membrane depolarization and was frequency-independent. Mexiletine reduced K2P13.1 open rectification properties and shifted current-voltage relationships towards more negative potentials. In conclusion, atrial expression and AF-associated downregulation of K2P13.1 channels in a porcine model resemble human findings and support a general role for K2P13.1 in AF pathophysiology. K2P13.1 current sensitivity to antiarrhythmic drugs provides a starting point for further development of an emerging antiarrhythmic paradigm.",Nitric oxide radicals are emitted by wasp eggs to kill mold fungi.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31182189,eLife,2019 06 13,"Detrimental microbes caused the evolution of a great diversity of antimicrobial defenses in plants and animals.

We provide evidence that a NO-synthase (NOS) is involved in the generation of the extraordinary concentrations of nitrogen radicals in brood cells (~1500 ppm NO⋅ and its oxidation product NO2⋅). Sequencing of the beewolf NOS gene revealed no conspicuous differences to related species. However, due to alternative splicing, the NOS-mRNA in beewolf eggs lacks an exon near the regulatory domain.

Although centrioles are known to regulate PCM assembly, it is less known whether and how the PCM contributes to centriole assembly. Here we investigate the interaction between centriole components and the PCM by taking advantage of fission yeast, which has a centriole-free, PCM-containing centrosome, the SPB. Surprisingly, we observed that several ectopically-expressed animal centriole components such as SAS-6 are recruited to the SPB. We revealed that a conserved PCM component, Pcp1/pericentrin, interacts with and recruits SAS-6. This interaction is conserved and important for centriole assembly, particularly its elongation. We further explored how yeasts kept this interaction even after centriole loss and showed that the conserved calmodulin-binding region of Pcp1/pericentrin is critical for SAS-6 interaction. Our work suggests that the PCM not only recruits and concentrates microtubule-nucleators, but also the centriole assembly machinery, promoting biogenesis close by.",Prolonged Anesthetic Recovery after Continuous Infusion of Midazolam in 2 Domestic Cats (Felis catus).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31182185,Comparative medicine,2019 06 11,"Two healthy research cats involved in a randomized, blinded prospective pharmacodynamics study evaluating midazolamcontinuous-rate infusion as a means to decrease sevoflurane concentrations experienced unexpectedly prolonged recoveries.Midazolam loading doses, infusion rates, and the targeted plasma midazolam concentrations at steady-state were determinedby pharmacokinetic modeling based on the results of a preliminary pharmacokinetic study using a single dose of midazolam. In the pharmacodynamics study, cats remained oversedated after recovery from anesthesia, and plasma concentrations of midazolam and its primary metabolite (1-hydroxymidazolam) remained elevated. The use of flumazenil was unsuccessful in timely treatment of oversedation. Administration of intravenous lipid emulsion was used in one of the cats to facilitate recovery and appeared to be effective in both reducing the depth of midazolam-induced oversedation and significantly reducing the plasma concentration of 1-hydroxymidazolam. The effects after the administration of both treatment modalities on clinical signs and plasma drug concentrations in cats are discussed. The observations suggest that cats may eliminate 1-hydroxymidazolam more slowly than expected; consequently dose adjustments may be required when continuous infusionof midazolam is intended. In addition, intravenous lipid emulsion may facilitate recovery from midazolam oversedation,particularly in cases unresponsive to traditional treatment modalities.

A randomized, single-blind and cross-over trial included 15 obese adolescents aged 12-18 years with IR. All participants were submitted two different breakfasts: low glycaemic index, low insulin index (LGI-LII) and low glycaemic index, high insulin index (LGI-HII), with a one-week washout period between meals. At time 0 (just before breakfast), 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 180 and 240 minutes after the meal, serum glucose, insulin and C-peptide levels, and appetite scores were measured.

Nevertheless, many areas in cloning, especially those associated with wild mammals, are still in question because of the difficulty in obtaining cytoplasmic donor cells (or cytoplasts). Conversely, donor cell nuclei (or karyoplasts) are widely obtained from the skin of living or post-mortem individuals and often maintained in somatic cell banks. Moreover, the creation of karyoplast-cytoplast complexes by fusion followed by activation and embryo development is one of the most difficult steps that requires further clarification to avoid genetic failures. Although difficult, cloning different species, such as wild carnivores and ungulates, can be successful via iSCNT with embryo development and the birth of offspring. Thus, novel research in the area that contributes to the conservation of biodiversity and knowledge of the physiology of species continues. The present review presents the failures and successes that occurred with the application of the technique in wild mammals, with the goal of helping future work on cloning via iSCNT."

Recently, gut microbiome-host relations have been implicated in cardiovascular disease and associated metabolic conditions; therefore, gut microbiota may be key mediators or modulators driving the observed sexual dimorphism in disease onset and progression. While current evidence regarding pure physiological sex differences in gut microbiome composition is modest, robust research suggests that gut microbiome-dependent metabolites may interact with important biological pathways under sex hormone control, including toll-like receptor and flavin monooxygenase signaling. Here, we review key sex differences in gut microbiome interactions with four primary determinants of cardiovascular disease, impaired glucose regulation, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and obesity.

Also, in New Zealand, certain factors that contribute to postoperative infection are more common in Māori and Pacific populations. To date, most efforts to reduce postoperative infection have focussed on surgical aspects of care and on antibiotic prophylaxis, but recent research shows that anaesthesia providers may also have an impact on infection transmission. These providers sometimes exhibit imperfect hand hygiene and frequently transfer the blood or saliva of their patients to their work environment. In addition, intravenous medications may become contaminated whilst being drawn up and administered to patients. Working with relevant practitioners and other experts, we have developed an evidence-informed bundle to improve key aseptic practices by anaesthetists with the aim of reducing postoperative infection. The key elements of the bundle are the filtering of compatible drugs, context-relevant hand hygiene practices and enhanced maintenance of clean work surfaces.",Does VEGF-targeted active immunotherapy induce complete abrogation of platelet VEGF levels?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31182141,BMC research notes,2019 06 14,"Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is involved in physiological angiogenesis, but also is considered one of the key factors that promotes tumor angiogenesis.

Currently, no technique is available for bedside evaluation of global cerebral energy state, and until now blood pressure targets have been based on limited clinical evidence. Recent experimental and clinical studies indicate that it might be possible to evaluate cerebral oxidative metabolism from measuring the lactate-to-pyruvate (LP) ratio of the draining venous blood. In this study, jugular bulb microdialysis and immediate bedside biochemical analysis are introduced as new diagnostic tools to evaluate the effect of higher mean arterial blood pressure on global cerebral metabolism and the degree of cellular damage after OHCA."

A 2 × 2 crossover study comparing multiple oral doses of IR and SR formulations of cilostazol were conducted. Serial plasma concentrations of cilostazol and its active metabolites were used in this analysis and best depicted by one compartment model, with absorption kinetics of cilostazol having mixed first- and zero-order kinetics with a time delay at the beginning of absorption. The introduction of interoccasion variabilities into zero-order (D1), first-order (Ka), and relative bioavailability (F1) significantly improved the model fit, and total body water (TBW) was identified as a significant covariate positively affecting the clearance of cilostazol. The model validation suggested that the model constructed in this study predicted the plasma concentration of cilostazol and its two active metabolites reasonably well. The PK model we developed explored the PK characteristics of cilostazol in Korean male subjects, and may be useful for identifying optimal individual dosing regimens of cilostazol.",Do Older People Accurately Estimate the Length of Their First Step during Gait Initiation?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181989,Experimental aging research,2019 06 11,"Background/Study Context: Advancing age is associated with a decrease in step length. In line with previous studies showing that older adults often overestimate their motor abilities, we investigate whether older adults overestimate the length of their first step during gait initiation. The underlying effect could be a failure to update the internal model of motor action as a function of age-related motor decline. Methods: Without taking a step, community-dwelling older women (n = 22, age range: 68-87 years) and younger women (n = 19, age range: 19-33 years) estimated the length of their first step for both preferred step length and largest step length, which were performed without endangerment. Thereafter, the participants performed real gait initiation for both types of steps. The estimated step lengths were compared to the actual step lengths. Results: Older adults judged their first step as larger than it was (mean error: 30% for the preferred step and 9% for the largest step). A fine-grained analysis showed that this effect mainly concerned those for whom an increased risk of falling was suspected. These older adults were also among those who performed the shortest steps, and they presented with a slight decrease in cognitive functioning. Younger participants underestimated their preferred step length. Overall, the estimates were more accurate for the largest steps than for the preferred-length steps. Conclusion: Step length estimation revealed powerful evidence for overestimation in older adults. Those who overestimated step length presented with more signs of motor decline. While this result sustains the idea of an insufficient actualization of the motor-action model, the explanation also refers to more global appraisal processes. Further research should explore the relevance of this task as a clinical laboratory tool for assessing gait capacity and the risk of falling.","Development of tibulizumab, a tetravalent bispecific antibody targeting BAFF and IL-17A for the treatment of autoimmune disease.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181988,mAbs,2019 06 11,"We describe a bispecific dual-antagonist antibody against human B cell activating factor (BAFF) and interleukin 17A (IL-17). An anti-IL-17 single-chain variable fragment (scFv) derived from ixekizumab (Taltz®) was fused via a glycine-rich linker to anti-BAFF tabalumab. The IgG-scFv bound both BAFF and IL-17 simultaneously with identical stoichiometry as the parental mAbs. Stability studies of the initial IgG-scFv revealed chemical degradation and aggregation not observed in either parental antibody. The anti-IL-17 scFv showed a high melting temperature (Tm) by differential scanning calorimetry (73.1°C), but also concentration-dependent, initially reversible, protein self-association. To engineer scFv stability, three parallel approaches were taken: labile complementary-determining region (CDR) residues were replaced by stable, affinity-neutral amino acids, CDR charge distribution was balanced, and a H44-L100 interface disulfide bond was introduced. The Tm of the disulfide-stabilized scFv was largely unperturbed, yet it remained monodispersed at high protein concentration. Fluorescent dye binding titrations indicated reduced solvent exposure of hydrophobic residues and decreased proteolytic susceptibility was observed, both indicative of enhanced conformational stability. Superimposition of the H44-L100 scFv (PDB id: 6NOU) and ixekizumab antigen-binding fragment (PDB id: 6NOV) crystal structures revealed nearly identical orientation of the frameworks and CDR loops. The stabilized bispecific molecule LY3090106 (tibulizumab) potently antagonized both BAFF and IL-17 in cell-based and in vivo mouse models. In cynomolgus monkey, it suppressed B cell development and survival and remained functionally intact in circulation, with a prolonged half-life. In summary, we engineered a potent bispecific antibody targeting two key cytokines involved in human autoimmunity amenable to clinical development.","Feeding Aspergillus protease preparation combined with adequate protein diet to rats increases levels of cecum gut-protective amino acids, partially linked to Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181987,"Bioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry",2019 06 11,"Our recent study indicated that dietary Aspergillus oryzae-derived protease preparation (AP), through its enzymatic activity, exerted a bifidogenic effect in rats. We hypothesized that dietary AP links to protein degradation and subsequently elevates gut-protective amino acids (AAs) in rats fed adequate protein diet. In this study, dietary AP markedly increased the relative abundance of Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus and the levels of free threonine, alanine, proline, taurine, ornithine, phenylalanine, cystine, and γ-aminobutyric acid in the cecum contents of rats fed with an adequate protein diet, but not in those fed with a low-protein diet. The elevated AAs, except ornithine and phenylalanine, potentially have gut-related health benefits. Some of the AP-modulated free AAs appeared to be associated with the relative abundance of Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus. Thus, AP combined with adequate protein diet is likely to increase the levels of cecum beneficial free AAs, which is partially associated with the relative abundance of the probiotics.",Photocatalytic reduction of Cr(VI) using Mg doped WO3 nanoparticles.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181985,Environmental technology,2019 06 11,"The hydrothermal synthesis method was employed for the fabrication of pristine tungsten trioxide (WO3) and that of varying dopant percentages (1, 3 and 5 % m/m) of magnesium (Mg-WO3). The optical and structural properties of the synthesized materials were characterized using DRS, XRD, FTIR, TEM, BET, FESEM, XPS, PL, and Raman. Rectangular shaped nanostructures were observed through FESEM, wherein confirmed as monoclinic with the aid of XRD, FTIR and Raman analysis. Visualisation of the doping was carried out using HRTEM imagery, which was also confirmed by a slight increase (0.0069 nm) of d spacing. As a consequence, band gaps were diminished and band edge positions were shifted. Band edge position shifts were confirmed via XPS analysis (0.08 eV). The point of zero charge was observed to shift towards positive upon doping at working pH 1 and 3.75 pH was the highest recorded. The rate of recombination was greatly reduced upon doping was observed through PL analysis. This was supported by DFT calculations, in which case the reduction of the rate of recombination was attributed to the introduction of Mg orbital. An improved efficiency was observed via the photo reduction of Cr(VI) metal ion in waste water, in which case, 97 % reduction was attained.","General Sleep Disturbance Scale: Translation, cultural adaptation, and psychometric properties of the Italian version.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181984,Cranio : the journal of craniomandibular practice,2019 06 11,"Objective: The aim of this study was to translate, culturally adapt, and test the psychometric characteristics of the General Sleep Disturbance Scale (GSDS) and to detect and explore the presence of sleep disorders in the healthy Italian population.

Dependent on time to reperfusion and collateral flow, myocardial infarction ( MI ) will manifest, with transmural MI portending poor prognosis. Late gadolinium enhancement cardiac magnetic resonance imaging can detect MI with  high diagnostic accuracy. Primary percutaneous coronary intervention is the preferred reperfusion strategy in patients with ST -segment-elevation MI with <12 hours of symptom onset. We sought to visualize time-dependent necrosis in a population with ST -segment-elevation MI by using late gadolinium enhancement cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (STEMI-SCAR project). Methods and Results ST -segment-elevation MI patients with single-vessel disease, complete occlusion with TIMI (Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction) score 0, absence of collateral flow (Rentrop score 0), and symptom onset <12 hours were consecutively enrolled. Using late gadolinium enhancement cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, the area at risk and infarct size, myocardial salvage index, transmurality index, and transmurality grade (0-50%, 51-75%, 76-100%) were determined. In total, 164 patients (aged 54±11 years, 80% male) were included. A receiver operating characteristic curve (area under the curve: 0.81) indicating transmural necrosis revealed the best diagnostic cutoff for a symptom-to-balloon time of 121 minutes: patients with >121 minutes demonstrated increased infarct size, transmurality index, and transmurality grade (all P<0.01) and decreased myocardial salvage index ( P<0.001) versus patients with symptom-to-balloon times ≤121 minutes. Conclusions In MI with no residual antegrade and no collateral flow, immediate reperfusion is vital. A symptom-to-balloon time of >121 minutes causes a high grade of transmural necrosis. In this pure ST -segment-elevation MI population, time to reperfusion to salvage myocardium was less than suggested by current guidelines."

Purpose
: Uncorrected refractive errors are the leading cause of visual impairment in children, affecting children in all settings. The majority of refractive errors can be corrected with spectacles. High compliance with spectacle wear is required for children to realize the benefit, such as higher academic achievement. This review collates evidence on compliance with spectacle wear, factors which predict spectacle wear and reasons for non-compliance among schoolchildren. 
Methods
: Literature searches were conducted on Medline, Embase, Global Health and the Cochrane Library. The date range was January 2000 to November 2017 and there were no language restrictions. The search retrieved a total of 1299 references, 522 duplicate records were removed leaving 777 references to assess. Twenty-five studies were included in the review. 
Results
: Evidence suggests that greater severity of uncorrected refractive error and lower levels of uncorrected visual acuity are associated with higher levels of spectacle wear. Addressing socio-demographic reasons for non-compliance is complex as they are context specific. Evidence that children become less compliant with spectacle wear with increasing age is not consistent. Quantitative data indicate girls are more likely to be compliant with spectacles wear than boys, but qualitative studies highlight specific challenges faced by girls. 
Conclusion
: There was considerable variation between studies in how spectacle compliance was defined, the time interval between dispensing the spectacles and assessment, and how compliance was assessed. There is need to standardize all aspects of the assessment of compliance. Further qualitative and quantitative studies are required in a range of settings to assess the biomedical and socio-demographic factors which affect spectacle wear compliance using standard definitions.","""Big Sister"" Wisdom: How might non-Indigenous speech-language pathologists genuinely, and effectively, engage with Indigenous Australia?",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181968,International journal of speech-language pathology,2019 06 11,"Speech Pathology Australia, through its landmark project for the profession, ""Speech Pathology 2030 - making futures happen"" (SP 2030), calls for speech-language pathologists to ""respond (to presenting clients) in ways that respect each person's culture, language, life experiences, and preferences"" (Speech Pathology Australia, 2016, p. viii). Such engagement, it holds, is central to successful practice. Meeting the needs of Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander (Indigenous) clients and communities, however, requires a skilled response to client wholeness, to their indissoluble, and unique, immersion in their: indigeneity; lived cultural experience; and the social, geographical, economic and political realities that surround them. Equally, the achievement of a truly-effective engagement, one able to engender desired outcomes, is also dependent on the challenging achievement of culturally-safe practice. Given that the relevant literature is, historically, based on a privileging of western purviews, this article asserts the validity of incorporating (pan-)Indigenous epistemologies and perspectives. As well as the Indigenous health and cultural safety literature, then, this article draws on particular Indigenous professional experience as a locus of good-practice evidence, one capable of contributing additional insights to best address the question: ""How might Non-Indigenous speech-language pathologists really engage, effectively, with Indigenous Australia?"".

But the mechanism is unclear. EIF3C was shown to be overexpressed in PCa tissues and cell lines. EIF3C overexpression was correlated to age and tumor stage in PCa patients and indicated poor survival. The proliferation, migration, and invasiveness of PC3 cells were all inhibited after EIF3C knockdown. Additionally, the phosphorylation level of PI3K and Akt was downregulated while total NF-κB and Myc decreased after EIF3C knockdown. But the expression of IκB increased reversely. Therefore, EIF3C at least partially regulates the activity of PI3K/Akt/NF-κB signaling pathway in PC3 cells.",Financial concern predicts deteriorations in mental and physical health among university students.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181966,Psychology & health,2019 06 11,"Objective: The aim of the present study was to investigate whether students' financial concerns predicted subsequent changes in their mental and physical health. In addition the opportunity was taken to test for reverse causality, by exploring whether initial levels of health predicted subsequent changes in financial concern. Design: The study employed a prospective correlational design. Main Outcome Measures: Undergraduate students at a British university (N = 337) completed measures of financial concern and health at two time points, approximately 8 weeks apart. Results: Regression analyses indicated that experiencing greater financial concern at baseline was associated with subsequent deteriorations in health on the following outcomes: role limitation due to physical problems, role limitation due to emotional problems, social functioning, mental health, general health perception and change in health. By contrast, there was no evidence that initial health influenced subsequent changes in financial concern. Conclusion: Findings suggest that financial concern might adversely impact mental and physical health outcomes in student populations.",Exploiting DNA repair defects in breast cancer: from chemotherapy to immunotherapy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181965,Expert review of anticancer therapy,2019 06 11,"Introduction: Impaired DNA damage response (DDR) and subsequent genomic instability is associated with carcinogenic process itself, but it also results in sensitivity of tumor cells to certain drugs and can be exploited to treat cancer by inducing deadly mutations or mitotic catastrophe. Exploiting DDR defects in breast cancer cells has been one of the main strategies in both conventional chemotherapy, targeted therapies or immunotherapies. Areas covered: In this review, the authors first discuss DDR mechanisms in healthy cells and DDR defects in breast cancer, then focus on current therapies and developments in the treatment of DDR deficient breast cancer. Expert opinion: Among conventional chemotherapeutics, platinum-based regimens in particular seem to be effective in DDR-deficient patients. PARP inhibitors represent one of the successful models of translational research in this area and clinical data showed high efficacy and reasonable toxicity with these agents in patients with breast cancer and BRCA mutation. Recent studies have underlined that some subtypes of breast cancer are highly immunogenic. Promising activity has been shown with immunotherapeutic agents particularly in DDR deficient breast cancers. Chemotherapeutics, DNA repair pathway inhibitors and immunotherapies might result in further improved outcomes in certain subsets of patients with breast cancer and DDR.",Emerging therapies in Huntington's disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181964,Expert review of neurotherapeutics,2019 06 11,"Introduction Huntington's disease (HD) is an inherited neurodegenerative condition for which there are no disease-modifying treatments. The availability of early genetic diagnosis makes HD an ideal candidate for early intervention. Growing understanding of pathogenesis has led to identification of new therapeutic targets for which some compounds are now in clinical trials. Areas covered A detailed review of medical databases and clinical trial registries was performed. Recent clinical trials aimed to establish disease-modification were included. Focus was assigned to RNA and DNA-based therapies aimed at lowering mutant huntingtin (mHTT) including antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs), RNA interference (RNAi), zinc finger proteins (ZFPs) and the CRISPR-Cas9 system. Modulation of mHTT and immunotherapies are also covered. Expert opinion Targeting HD pathogenesis at its most proximal level is under intense investigation. ASOs are the only HTT-lowering strategy in clinical trials of manifest HD. Safety and efficacy of an allele specific vs. allele non-specific approach has yet to be established. Success will extend to premanifest carriers for which development of clinical and imaging biomarkers will be necessary. Scientific and technological advancement will bolster new methods of treatment delivery. Cumulative experience, collaborative research and platforms such as ENROLL-HD will facilitate efficient and effective clinical trials.",Effects of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on balance improvement: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181963,Somatosensory & motor research,2019 06 11,"Background: Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has emerged as a promising therapeutic tool to improve balance and optimize rehabilitation strategies. However, current literature shows the methodological heterogeneity of tDCS protocols and results, hindering any clear conclusions about the effects of tDCS on postural control. Objective: Evaluate the effectiveness of tDCS on postural control, and identify the most beneficial target brain areas and the effect on different populations. Methods: Two independent reviewers selected randomized tDCS clinical-trials studies from PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and reference lists of retrieved articles published between 1998 and 2017. Most frequently reported centre of pressure (COP) variables were selected for meta-analysis. Other postural control outcomes were discussed in the review. Results: Thirty studies were included in the systematic review, and 11 were submitted to a meta-analysis. A reduction of COP displacement area has been significantly achieved by tDCS, evidencing an improvement in balance control. Individuals with cerebral palsy (CP) and healthy young adults are mostly affected by stimulation. The analysis of the impact of tDCS over different brain areas revealed a significant effect after primary motor cortex (M1) stimulation, however, with no clear results after cerebellar stimulation due to divergent results among studies. Conclusions: tDCS appears to improve balance control, more evident in healthy and CP subjects. Effects are observed when primary MI is stimulated. Cerebellar stimulation should be better investigated.","Use of Dermaflage®, a silicone-based skin camouflage product, for treatment of medial canthal fistula.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181962,"Orbit (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",2019 06 11,"Medial canthal fistulas present a therapeutic challenge, given that the risk factors for development of this and similar complications also contribute to their difficulty to treat.

Differentiated HIV care models may improve IPT completion by addressing joint barriers to IPT and HIV treatment. However, the impact of differentiated care on IPT completion remains unknown. In a cross-sectional study of people with HIV on antiretroviral therapy in 5 communities in rural Uganda, we compared IPT completion between patients receiving HIV care via a differentiated care model versus a standard HIV care model and assessed multi-level predictors of IPT completion. A total of 103/144 (72%) patients received differentiated care and 85/161 (53%) received standard care completed IPT (p < 0.01). Adjusting for age, gender and community, patients receiving differentiated care had higher odds of completing IPT (aOR: 2.6, 95% CI: 1.5-4.5, p < 0.01). Predictors of IPT completion varied by the care model, and differentiated care modified the positive association between treatment completion and the belief in the efficacy of IPT and the negative association with side-effects. Patients receiving a multi-component differentiated care model had a higher odds of IPT completion than standard care, and the model's impact on health beliefs, social support, and perceived side effects to IPT may underlie this positive association.",Health insurance coverage among American Indians and Alaska Natives in the context of the Affordable Care Act.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181960,Ethnicity & health,2019 06 11,"Objectives: American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/AN) have a unique healthcare system uniquely interwoven with the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The aim of this study is to document changes in health insurance among AI/AN adults before and after implementation of the ACA. Design: We used data from the American Community Survey from 2008 to 2016 to examine trends in health insurance. We compared to Non-Hispanic Whites and stratified AI/AN adults with and without Indian Health Service (IHS) coverage. We used multivariate regression to evaluate the probability of health insurance post-ACA and included time period and subgroup interaction terms. Results: Public and private health insurance coverage increased post-ACA by 3.17 and 1.24 percentage points, respectively, but the percent uninsured remained high (37.7% of those with IHS coverage and 19.2% of those without). AI/AN in Medicaid Expansion states had a significantly greater percentage point (pp) increase in public insurance (6.31 pp, 95% CI 5.04-7.59) than AI/AN in non-expansion states (p < 0.001). There was a greater increase in private coverage among AI/AN without IHS compared to AI/AN with IHS coverage (p = 0.002). Conclusions: Despite improvements in healthcare insurance coverage for AI/AN, substantial disparities remain. The improvements appeared to be largely driven by Medicaid Expansion. Without specific considerations for AI/AN, future healthcare reforms could intensify health injustices and inequities they face."

Lasing from band-edge plasmons and amplified spontaneous emission from propagating plasmons showed rise times on the order of tens of picoseconds, during which inverted population in the gain was first generated and then followed by energy transfer to the lattice plasmon cavity for enhanced light emission.",Adsorption Features of Formaldehyde on TiO2(110) Surface Probed by High-Resolution Scanning Tunnelling Microscopy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181938,The journal of physical chemistry letters,2019 06 11,"We report a real-space imaging of formaldehyde (HCHO) adsorption on a TiO2(110) surface probed by high-resolution scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM). Density functional theory calculations (DFT) were carried out to assign the observed features. The adsorptions occur exclusively on 5-fold coordinated Ti (Ti5c) sites and oxygen vacancies (OVs). The well-resolved configurations on the Ti5c sites feature the overlapping of the two ""dumbbell"" structures which are originated from the empty orbitals of HCHO. The STM images for the physical adsorption of HCHO on the OV sites appear fuzzy because of the rapid switching of HCHO among the three stable orientations, while those for the chemical adsorption are much clearer, revealing a distinctive difference between chemical and physical adsorptions. This work presents a systematic characterization of the topological features of HCHO/TiO2(110) and provides useful information for mechanical understanding of the reaction mechanism of HCHO on the surfaces."

Also hybridizations of different fullerene families (e.g., empty fullerene, heterofullerenes, and endohedral fullerenes as well as their isomers) are considered as inter-SCA architectures and represent an emerging class of nanofunctional materials. Such highly integrated hybrids are quite promising, since they hold the potential of combining unique properties of each building block. For instance, hybridization of 2D-graphene, a synthetic carbon allotrope with outstanding chemical/physical properties, with 0D-fullerenes leads to materials with both outstanding solid state properties (e.g., electron mobility, flexibility, transparency, and mechanical stability) and distinct molecular properties (spatially resolved and tailor-made exohedral cage functionalization and endohedral guest encapsulation). Therefore, such integrated hybrids have potential as multifunctional nanocarbon materials applicable, for example, in energy storage, electronic devices, solar cells, or advanced sensors. Recognizing these significant advantages, a series of methods and techniques has been developed to synthesize such integrated hybrids. Based on in-depth understanding of fullerene chemistry, interfullerene hybrids where multiple fullerenes are linked together have been synthesized and fully characterized. However, due to the difficulty in functionalizing graphene or CNTs as a result of their poor dispersibility and weak reactivity the corresponding hybrids including these macromolecular forms are less explored. Furthermore, few approaches toward such systems reported so far inevitably involve some drawbacks such as low degree of addition and low production ability. This Account presents the concepts and strategies of our studies on the construction of inter-SCA hybrids. We first emphasize on our efficient ""reductive functionalization route"" as a versatile strategy for graphene/CNT functionalization. In sharp contrast to previous approaches, our strategy enables unprecedented functionalization of graphene/CNT without damaging their structures. As a consequence, the door for cross-dimensional architectures via hybridizing graphene/CNT with fullerenes has been opened. We will then summarize the diverse inter-SCA hybrids that we recently synthesized, ranging from interfullerene hybrids to those of cross-dimensional graphene/CNT-(endo)fullerenes hybrids as well as CNTs networks. For interfullerene hybrids, different types of fullerenes including empty fullerenes, heterofullerenes, and endohedral fullerenes have been employed. Finally, the prospects on the future challenges on inter-SCA hybrids are envisioned. This Account will provide fundamental insight into construction of inter-SCA hybrids and stimulate further efforts toward research on this emerging topic.",Understanding Nanoparticle Toxicity Mechanisms To Inform Redesign Strategies To Reduce Environmental Impact.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181913,Accounts of chemical research,2019 06 11,"There has been a surge of consumer products that incorporate nanoparticles, which are used to improve or impart new functionalities to the products based on their unique physicochemical properties. With such an increase in products containing nanomaterials, there is a need to understand their potential impacts on the environment. This is often done using various biological models that are abundant in the different environmental compartments where the nanomaterials may end up after use. Beyond studying whether nanomaterials simply kill an organism, the molecular mechanisms by which nanoparticles exhibit toxicity have been extensively studied. Some of the main mechanisms include (1) direct nanoparticle association with an organism's cell surface, where the membrane can be damaged or initiate internal signaling pathways that damage the cell, (2) dissolution of the material, releasing toxic ions that impact the organism, generally through impairing important enzyme functions or through direct interaction with a cell's DNA, and (3) the generation of reactive oxygen species and subsequent oxidative stress on an organism, which can also damage important enzymes or an organism's genetic material. This Account reviews these toxicity mechanisms, presenting examples for each with different types of nanomaterials. Understanding the mechanism of nanoparticle toxicity will inform efforts to redesign nanoparticles with reduced environmental impact. The redesign strategies will need to be chosen based on the major mode of toxicity, but also considering what changes can be made to the nanomaterial without impacting its ability to perform in its intended application. To reduce interactions with the cell surface, nanomaterials can be designed to have a negative surface charge, use ligands such as polyethylene glycol that reduce protein binding, or have a morphology that discourages binding with a cell surface. To reduce the nanoparticle dissolution to toxic ions, the toxic species can be replaced with less toxic elements that have similar properties, the nanoparticle can be capped with a shell material, the morphology of the nanoparticle can be chosen to minimize surface area and thus minimize dissolution, or a chelating agent can be co-introduced or functionalized onto the nanomaterial's surface. To reduce the production of reactive oxygen species, the band gap of the material can be tuned either by using different elements or by doping, a shell layer can be added to inhibit direct contact with the core, or antioxidant molecules can be tethered to the nanoparticle surface. When redesigning nanoparticles, it will be important to test that the redesign strategy actually reduces toxicity to organisms from relevant environmental compartments. It is also necessary to confirm that the nanomaterial still demonstrates the critical physicochemical properties that inspired its inclusion in a product or device."

Recent studies show that NMCs sequester RNA and enhance ribozyme reactions, a critical tenet of the RNA World Hypothesis. As RNA is negatively charged, it is expected to interact with polycationic coacervate components. The molecular basis for how identity and concentration of polyanionic components of complex coacervates affect ribozyme catalysis remains unexplored. We report here a general mechanism wherein diverse polyanions enhance ribozyme catalysis in complex coacervates. By competing for unproductive RNA-polycation interactions, polyanions enhance ribozyme reaction more than 12-fold. The generality of our findings is supported by similar behavior in three polyanions-polycarboxylates, polysulfates, and polysulfates/carboxylates-as well as two different ribozymes, the hammerhead and hairpin.

The extra load on endogenous processes shifts the equilibrium of resource allocation in the host, leading to slow growth and reduced biosynthesis. Here we built integrated host-circuit models to quantify growth defects caused by synthetic gene circuits. Simulations reveal a complex relation between circuit output and cellular capacity for gene expression. For weak induction of heterologous genes, protein output can be increased at the expense of growth defects. Yet for stronger induction, cellular capacity reaches a tipping point, beyond which both gene expression and growth rate drop sharply. Extensive simulations across various growth conditions and large regions of the design space suggest that the critical capacity is a result of ribosomal scarcity. We studied the impact of growth defects on various gene circuits and transcriptional logic gates, which highlights the extent to which cellular burden can limit, shape, and even break down circuit function.

However, the high and persistent radioactivity accumulation of exendin 4 in the kidneys limits accurate diagnosis and safe, as well as effective, radiotherapy in insulinomas. In this study, we intend to reduce the renal accumulation of radiolabeled exendin 4 through degradation mediated by brush border membrane enzymes. A new exendin 4 ligand NOTA-MVK-Cys40-Leu14-Exendin 4 containing Met-Val-Lys (MVK) linker between the peptide and 1,4,7-triazacyclononane-1,4,7-triacetic acid (NOTA) chelator was synthesized and labeled with 68Ga. The in vitro mouse serum stability and cell binding affinity of the tracer were evaluated. Initial in vitro cleavage of the linker was determined by incubation of a model compound Boc-MVK-Dde with brush border membrane vesicles (BBMVs) with and without the inhibitor of neutral endopeptidase (NEP). Further cleavage studies were performed with the full structure of NOTA-MVK-Cys40-Leu14-Exendin 4. Kidney and urine samples were collected in the in vivo metabolism study after intravenous injection of 68Ga-NOTA-MVK-Cys40-Leu14-Exendin 4. The microPET images were acquired in INS-1 tumor model at different time points; the radioactivity uptake of 68Ga-NOTA-MVK-Cys40-Leu14-Exendin 4 in tumor and kidneys were determined and compared with the control radiotracer without MVK linker. 68Ga-NOTA-MVK-Cys40-Leu14-Exendin 4 was stable in mouse serum. The MVK modification did not affect the affinity of NOTA-MVK-Cys40-Leu14-Exendin 4 toward GLP-1R. The in vitro cleavage study and in vivo metabolism study confirmed that the MVK sequence can be recognized by BBM enzymes and cleaved at the amide bond between Met and Val, thus releasing the small fragment containing Met. MicroPET images showed that the tumor uptake of 68Ga-NOTA-MVK-Cys40-Leu14-Exendin 4 was comparable to that of the control, while the kidney uptake was significantly reduced. As a result, more favorable tumor to kidney ratios were achieved. In this study, a novel exendin 4 analogue, NOTA-MVK-Cys40-Leu14-Exendin 4, was successfully synthesized and labeled with 68Ga. With the cleavable MVK sequence, this ligand could be cleaved by the enzymes on kidneys, and releasing the fragment of 68Ga-NOTA-Met-OH, which will rapidly excrete from urine. As the high and consistent renal radioactivity accumulation could be significantly reduced, NOTA-MVK-Cys40-Leu14-Exendin 4 shows great potential in the diagnosis and radiotherapy for insulinoma.",Combination Suicide Gene Delivery with an Adeno-Associated Virus Vector Encoding Inducible Caspase-9 and a Chemical Inducer of Dimerization Is Effective in a Xenotransplantation Model of Hepatocellular Carcinoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181889,Bioconjugate chemistry,2019 06 11,"Current treatment approaches for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have a narrow therapeutic index and alternate modes of treatment are thus required.

Regarding assisted reproductive technology, AMH has been efficiently used as a marker to predict ovarian response to stimulation. The clinical use of AMH has recently been extended and emphasized. The uses of AMH as a predictive marker of menopause onset, diagnostic tool for polycystic ovary syndrome, and assessment of ovarian function before and after gynecologic surgeries or gonadotoxic agents such as chemotherapy have been investigated. Serum AMH levels can also be affected by environmental and genetic factors; thus, the effects of factors that may alter AMH test results should be considered. This review summarizes the findings of recent studies focusing on the clinical application of AMH and factors that influence the AMH level and opinions on the use of the AMH level to assess the probability of conception before reproductive life planning as a ""fertility test.""",Primordial follicle activation as new treatment for primary ovarian insufficiency.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181871,Clinical and experimental reproductive medicine,2019 06 11,"Primordial follicle activation is a process in which individual primordial follicles leave their dormant state and enter a growth phase. While existing hormone stimulation strategies targeted the growing follicles, the remaining dormant primordial follicles were ruled out from clinical use. Recently, in vitro activation (IVA), which is a method for controlling primordial follicle activation, has provided an innovative technology for primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) patients. IVA was developed based on Hippo signaling and phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN)/phosphatidylinositol- 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT)/forkhead box O3 (FOXO3) signaling modulation. With this method, dormant primordial follicles are activated to enter growth phase and developed into competent oocytes. IVA has been successfully applied in POI patients who only have a few remaining remnant primordial follicles in the ovary, and healthy pregnancies and deliveries have been reported. IVA may also provide a promising option for fertility preservation in cancer patients and prepubertal girls whose fertility preservation choices are limited to tissue cryopreservation. Here, we review the basic mechanisms, translational studies, and current clinical results for IVA. Limitations and further study requirements that could potentially optimize IVA for future use will also be discussed.",para-Menthane as a Stable Terpene Derived from Orange By-Products as a Novel Solvent for Green Extraction and Solubilization of Natural Substances.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181870,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 11,"This study aims at investigating p-menthane, a novel bio-based solvent resulting from the hydrogenation of d-limonene, as a green alternative to n-hexane or toluene for the extraction and solubilization of natural substances. First, conductor-like combination of quantum chemistry (COSMO) coupled with statistical thermodynamics (RS) calculations show a comparable solubilization profile of p-menthane and n-hexane for carotene, volatile monoterpenes such as carvone and limonene, and model triglycerides. Other data obtained experimentally in solid/liquid extraction conditions further indicate that p-menthane showed similar performances to n-hexane for extracting carotenes from carrots, aromas from caraway seeds, and oils from rapeseeds, as these products showed a comparable composition. p-Menthane was also tested using common analytical extraction procedures such as Soxhlet for determination of oil content via multiple extraction stages, and Dean-Stark for determination of water content via azeotropic distillation. For both systems, yields were comparable, but for Dean-Stark, the distillation curve slope was higher when using p-menthane, and the time needed to attain 100% water recovery was 55% shorter than for toluene. Taken together, these results reveal the potential of p-menthane as a green replacer for petroleum-based solvents such as n-hexane or toluene.",Secondary Metabolites of Aeromonas veronii Strain A134 Isolated from a Microcystis aeruginosa Bloom.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181869,Metabolites,2019 06 11,"Aeromonas veronii strain A134 was isolated from Microcystis aeruginosa colonies collected from Lake Kinneret (Sea of Galilee), Israel.

We used a space-for-time substitution method to quantify N pools, processes, and fluxes along a hydrological gradient. Further, we linked N pools and processes and investigated not only surface but also subsurface sediments. Our results showed a gradual decrease in total N (TN) and mineralization rates (PNmin), but an increase in potential rates of nitrification (PNR) and denitrification (PDNR) under an elevated hydrological gradient, except for TN and PNmin in the subsurface sediment, which accumulated on the interaction zone between the high and middle tidal flats. Most sedimentary ammonium N (NH4+) and nitrate N (NO3-) concentrations were similar; however, NH4+ accumulated on the subsurface of the middle tidal flat. NO3- fluxes (from -0.54 to -0.35 mmol m-2 h-1) were uptake fluxes in the intertidal flats, but NH4+ fluxes (-2.48-3.54 mmol m-2 h-1) changed from uptake to efflux in the seaward direction. Structural equation modeling of the effects of inundation frequency, underground biomass, total carbon (TC), electrical conductivity (EC), and clay proportion on the N processes revealed that these accounted for 67%, 82%, and 17% of the variance of PDNR, PNmin, and PNR, respectively. Inundation frequency, underground biomass, TC, EC, and PNmin effects on N pools accounted for 53%, 69%, and 98% of the variance of NH4+, NO3-, and TN, respectively. This suggests that future sea level rise may decrease N storage due to increase in coupled nitrification-denitrification and decrease in N mineralization, and the NH4+ flux may change from sink to source in intertidal ecosystems.",Fabrication and Application of Carboxymethyl Cellulose-Carbon Nanotube Aerogels.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181867,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 11,"In this study, composite aerogels with excellent mechanical properties were prepared by using carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) as raw materials, with carboxylic carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as reinforcement. By controlling the mass fraction of CNTs, composite aerogels with different CNTs were prepared, and the surface morphology, specific surface area, compressive modulus, density and adsorption capacities towards different oils were studied. Compared to the pure CMC aerogel, the specific surface areas of CMC/CNTs were decreased because of the agglomeration of CNTs. However, the densities of composite aerogels were lower than pure CMC aerogel. This is because the CNTs were first dispersed in water and then added to CMC solution. The results indicated that it was easy for the low CMC initial concentration to be converted to low density aerogel. The compressive modulus was increased from 0.3 MPa of pure CMC aerogel to 0.5 MPa of 5 wt % CMC/CNTs aerogel. Meanwhile, the prepared aerogels showed promising properties as the adsorption materials. Because of the high viscosity, liquid possesses strong adhesion to the pore wall, the adsorption capacity of the CMC aerogel to the liquid increases as the viscosity of the liquid increases.",Fabrication of Polymer Micelles with Zwitterionic Shell and Biodegradable Core for Reductively Responsive Release of Doxorubicin.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181866,Polymers,2019 06 11,"To achieve a high stability in physiological environment and rapid intracellular drug release, a biodegradable zwitterionic triblock copolymer with a disulfide-linked poly-ε-caprolactone and polycarboxybetaine methacrylate (PCBMA-SS-PCL-SS-PCBMA) was prepared for micellar carrier to delivery doxorubicin (DOX) into tumor cells. PCBMA-SS-PCL-SS-PCBMA was obtained by following steps: i) introducing disulfide bonds through end-group modification of PCL diol with cystamine dihydrochloride; ii) preparing PCL-RAFT macromolecular chain transfer agent by EDC/NHS chemistry; iii) RAFT polymerization of zwitterionic monomer. Self-assembling from PCBMA-SS-PCL-SS-PCBMA, polymeric micelles had many advantages, such as ultra-low protein absorption in serum and obvious reduction-responsiveness in the presence of DTT. Furthermore, DOX-loaded micelles exhibited high stability upon centrifugation and lyophilization, a fast intracellular drug release and enhanced drug efficacy due to GSH-triggered PCBMA shell shedding and micellar reassembling. Thus, the polymeric micelles integrated several functions and properties could be prospectively utilized as valuable nanocarriers in cancer chemotherapeutics.",Autophagy in Synucleinopathy: The Overwhelmed and Defective Machinery.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181865,Cells,2019 06 11,"Alpha-synuclein positive-intracytoplasmic inclusions are the common denominators of the synucleinopathies present as Lewy bodies in Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, or glial cytoplasmic inclusions in multiple system atrophy.

Several decades of research have questioned the potential link between the autophagy machinery and alpha-synuclein protein toxicity in synucleinopathy and neurodegenerative processes. Here, we aimed to discuss the active participation of autophagy impairment in alpha-synuclein accumulation and propagation, as well as alpha-synuclein-independent neurodegenerative processes in the field of synucleinopathy.

However, two factors hamper their application in an objection detection task. First, a convolution in S2 (a two-dimensional sphere in three-dimensional space) or SO(3) (three-dimensional special orthogonal group) space results in the loss of an object's location. Second, overlarge bandwidth is required to preserve a small object's information on a sphere because the S2/SO(3) convolution must be performed on the whole sphere, instead of a local image patch. In this study, we propose a novel grid-based spherical CNN (G-SCNN) for detecting objects from spherical images. According to input bandwidth, a sphere image is transformed to a conformal grid map to be the input of the S2/SO3 convolution, and an object's bounding box is scaled to cover an adequate area of the grid map. This solves the second problem. For the first problem, we utilize a planar region proposal network (RPN) with a data augmentation strategy that increases rotation invariance. We have also created a dataset including 600 street view panoramic images captured from a vehicle-borne panoramic camera. The dataset contains 5636 objects of interest annotated with class and bounding box and is named as WHU (Wuhan University) panoramic dataset. Results on the dataset proved our grid-based method is extremely better than the original SCNN in detecting objects from spherical images, and it outperformed several mainstream object detection networks, such as Faster R-CNN and SSD.",Polymeric Composites with Silver (I) Cyanoximates Inhibit Biofilm Formation of Gram-Positive and Gram-Negative Bacteria.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181853,Polymers,2019 06 11,"Biofilms are surface-associated microbial communities known for their increased resistance to antimicrobials and host factors. This resistance introduces a critical clinical challenge, particularly in cases associated with implants increasing the predisposition for bacterial infections. Preventing such infections requires the development of novel antimicrobials or compounds that enhance bactericidal effect of currently available antibiotics. We have synthesized and characterized twelve novel silver(I) cyanoximates designated as Ag(ACO), Ag(BCO), Ag(CCO), Ag(ECO), Ag(PiCO), Ag(PICO) (yellow and red polymorphs), Ag(BIHCO), Ag(BIMCO), Ag(BOCO), Ag(BTCO), Ag(MCO) and Ag(PiPCO). The compounds exhibit a remarkable resistance to high intensity visible light, UV radiation and heat and have poor solubility in water. All these compounds can be well incorporated into the light-curable acrylate polymeric composites that are currently used as dental fillers or adhesives of indwelling medical devices. A range of dry weight % from 0.5 to 5.0 of the compounds was tested in this study. To study the potential of these compounds in preventing planktonic and biofilm growth of bacteria, we selected two human pathogens (Gram-negative Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus) and Gram-positive environmental isolate Bacillus aryabhattai. Both planktonic and biofilm growth was abolished completely in the presence of 0.5% to 5% of the compounds. The most efficient inhibition was shown by Ag(PiCO), Ag(BIHCO) and Ag(BTCO). The inhibition of biofilm growth by Ag(PiCO)-yellow was confirmed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Application of Ag(BTCO) and Ag(PiCO)-red in combination with tobramycin, the antibiotic commonly used to treat P. aeruginosa infections, showed a significant synergistic effect. Finally, the inhibitory effect lasted for at least 120 h in P. aeruginosa and 36 h in S. aureus and B. aryabhattai. Overall, several silver(I) cyanoximates complexes efficiently prevent biofilm development of both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria and present a particularly significant potential for applications against P. aeruginosa infections.",Homozygosity for Mobile Element Insertions Associated with WBSCR17 Could Predict Success in Assistance Dog Training Programs.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181852,Genes,2019 06 11,"Assistance dog training programs can see as many as 60% of their trainees dismissed. Many training programs utilize behavioral assays prior to admittance to identify likely successful candidates, yet such assays can be insconsistent. Recently, four canine retrotransposon mobile element insertions (MEIs) in or near genes WBSCR17 (Cfa6.6 and Cfa6.7), GTF2I (Cfa6.66) and POM121 (Cfa6.83) were identified in domestic dogs and gray wolves. Variations in these MEIs were significantly associated with a heightened propensity to initiate prolonged social contact or hypersociability. Using our dataset of 837 dogs, 228 of which had paired survey-based behavioral data, we discovered that one of the insertions in WBSCR17 is the most important predictor of dog sociable behaviors related to human proximity, measured by the Canine Behavioral Assessment Research Questionnaire (C-BARQ©). We found a positive correlation between insertions at Cfa6.6 and dog separation distress in the form of restlessness when about to be left alone by the owner. Lastly, assistance dogs showed significant heterozygosity deficiency at locus Cfa6.6 and higher frequency of insertions at Cfa6.6 and Cfa6.7. We suggest that training programs could utilize this genetic survey to screen for MEIs at WBSCR17 to identify dogs with sociable traits compatible with successful assistance dog performance.","Essential Oils-Loaded Polymer Particles: Preparation, Characterization and Antimicrobial Property.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181851,Polymers,2019 06 11,"In the last few years, essential oils (EOs) derived from plants have aroused great interest due to their well-known antimicrobial activity. Unfortunately, they present several limitations in their use, such as photosensitivity, temperature sensitivity, high volatility, and poor water solubility.

In this work, bergamot essential oil (BEO) and sweet orange essential oil (OEO) loaded-Eudragit® RS 100 (EuRS100) nanoparticles (NPs) were prepared by using the nanoprecipitation technique. We obtained nanoparticles characterized by a mean diameter of 57 to 208 nm and a positive surface charge (39 to 74 mV). The antibacterial activity of the obtained systems against Escherichia coli was in vitro investigated. We demonstrated that both orange and bergamot essential oils were successfully encapsulated and our nanoparticles have good antibacterial activity. Finally, in order to evaluate the potential applicability of OEONps to prolong fresh orange juice shelf-life, survival of E. coli during a storage period of one week at 25 °C was investigated: Orange essential oil-loaded nanoparticles (OEONPs) have been able to prolong the orange juice shelf life.",Taxol-Loaded MSC-Derived Exosomes Provide a Therapeutic Vehicle to Target Metastatic Breast Cancer and Other Carcinoma Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181850,Cancers,2019 06 11,"MSC-derived exosomes display, among others, an efficient biocompatibility and a reduced intrinsic immunogenicity, representing a valuable vehicle for drug delivery in a tumor-therapeutic approach. Following treatment of several human mesenchymal stroma/stem-like cell (MSC) populations with sub-lethal concentrations of taxol for 24 h, exosomes were isolated and applied to different human cancer populations including A549 lung cancer, SK-OV-3 ovarian cancer, and MDA-hyb1 breast cancer cells. While MSC control exosomes revealed little if any growth inhibition on the tumor cells, exposure to taxol-loaded MSC-derived exosomes was associated with 80-90% cytotoxicity. A similar application of taxol-loaded exosomes from HuVEC displayed much fewer effects. Quantification by LC-MS/MS analysis demonstrated a 7.6-fold reduced taxol concentration in MSC exosomes when compared to equivalent cytotoxic in vitro effects achieved with taxol substances, indicating a specific and more efficient tumor-targeting property. Consequently, MSC-derived taxol exosomes were tested in vivo. Highly metastatic MDA-hyb1 breast tumors were induced in NODscid mice, and systemic intravenous application of MSC-derived taxol exosomes revealed a more than 60% reduction of subcutaneous primary tumors. Moreover, the amount of distant organ metastases observed at least in lung, liver, spleen, and kidney was reduced by 50% with MSC taxol exosomes, similar to the effects observed with taxol, although the concentration of taxol in exosomes was about 1000-fold reduced. Together, these findings in different cancer cell populations and in vivo provide promising future perspectives for drug-loaded MSC-derived exosomes in efficiently targeting primary tumors and metastases by reducing side effects.",Accuracy of Buffy Coat in the Diagnosis of Disseminated Histoplasmosis in AIDS-Patients in an Endemic Area of Brazil.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181847,"Journal of fungi (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 11,"The buffy coat is obtained routinely for disseminated histoplamosis (DH) diagnosis in Ceará, Brazil.

The premise for the use the ratio transformation is that there is a zero-bias linear relationship between the panchromatic band and the corresponding multi-spectral bands. However, there are bias terms and residual terms with large values in reality, depending on the sensors, the response spectral ranges, and the land-cover types. To address this problem, this paper proposes a panchromatic and multi-spectral image fusion method based on the panchromatic spectral decomposition (PSD). The low-resolution panchromatic and multi-spectral images are used to solve the proportionality coefficients, the bias coefficients, and the residual matrixes. These coefficients are substituted into the high-resolution panchromatic band and decompose it into the high-resolution multi-spectral bands. The experiments show that this method can make the fused image acquire high color fidelity and sharpness, it is robust to different sensors and features, and it can be applied to the panchromatic and multi-spectral fusion of high-resolution optical satellites.","Preclinical Evaluation of 1,2-Diamino-4,5-Dibromobenzene in Genetically Engineered Mouse Models of Pancreatic Cancer.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181844,Cells,2019 06 11,"Background: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is highly resistant to standard chemo- and radiotherapy.

Here, we investigate the potential of 1,2-Diamino-4,5-dibromobenzene (2Br-DAB) in combination with standard chemotherapy and radiotherapy in murine and human PDAC. Methods: Cell viability and colony formation was performed in human (Panc1, BxPC3, PaTu8988t, MiaPaCa) and three murine LSL-KrasG12D/+;LSL-Trp53R172H/+;Pdx-1-Cre (KPC) pancreatic cancer cell lines. In vivo, preclinical experiments were conducted in LSL-KrasG12D/+;p48-Cre (KC) and KPC mice using 2Br-DAB (7 mg/kg, i.p.), +/- radiation (10 × 1.8 Gy), gemcitabine (100 mg/kg, i.p.), or a combination. Tumor growth and therapeutic response were assessed by high-resolution ultrasound and immunohistochemistry. Results: 2Br-DAB significantly reduced cell viability in human and murine pancreatic cancer cell lines in a dose-dependent manner. In particular, colony formation in human Panc1 cells was significantly decreased upon 25 µM 2Br-DAB + radiation treatment compared with vehicle control (p = 0.03). In vivo, 2Br-DAB reduced tumor frequency in KC mice. In the KPC model, 2Br-DAB or gemcitabine monotherapy had comparable therapeutic effects. Furthermore, the combination of gemcitabine and 2Br-DAB or 2Br-DAB and 18 Gy irradiation showed additional antineoplastic effects.

The as-received FD was processed via a simple and low-cost procedure, including sieving, deironing and milling using a variety of industrial equipment. FD powders before and after silane coupling agent (Si 69) modification were used as fillers for NR. NR composites inserted with different content of modified and unmodified FD up to 50 phr were prepared via dry-mixing method. Then, comprehensive mechanical performances were performed on the corresponding vulcanizates. It was demonstrated that NR composite filled with 50 phr of modified FD exhibited optimized comprehensive mechanical performance. Tear strength and hardness is increased by 21.3% and 12.8% than pure NR, respectively. Tensile strength is reduced by 21% and elongation at break remained nearly unchanged. Additionally, the composite showed a large increment of 50.9% for its wet grip property, while exhibited an increment of only 11.9% for its rolling resistance in comparison with the composite containing 10 phr of FD. The findings of this study may provide a new application area for the large amounts of utilization of foundry waste with a high level of value being added.",Four New Flavonoids Isolated from the Aerial Parts of Cadaba rotundifolia Forssk. (Qadab).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181831,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 11,"Cadaba rotundifolia (Forssk.) (family: Capparaceae; common name: Qadab) is one of four species that grow in the Red Sea costal region in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The roots and leaves of C. rotundifolia is traditionally used to treat tumors and abscesses in Sudan. A previous phytochemical study of the roots yielded a quaternary alkaloid, but no report on chemical constituents of the aerial parts of the C. rotundifolia growing in Saudi Arabia has been issued so far. Oxidative stress and advanced glycation end products (AGEs) are thought as causal factors in many degenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, diabetes, atherosclerosis and aging. In this study, a total of twenty compounds, including four previously undescribed acylated kaempferol glucosides, were isolated from the aerial parts of C. rotundifolia collected in Saudi Arabia. These new compounds were identified as kaempferol 3-O-[2-O-(trans-feruloyl)-3-O-β-d-glucopyranosyl]-β-d-glucopyranoside (1), kaempferol 3-O-β-neohesperidoside-7-O-[2-O-(cis-p-coumaroyl)-3-O-β-d-glucopyranosyl]-β-d-glucopyranoside (2), kaempferol 3-O-[2,6-di-O-α-l-rhamnopyranosyl]-β-d-glucopyranoside-7-O-[6-O-(trans-feruloyl)]-β-d-glucopyranoside (3) and kaempferol 3-O-[2,6-di-O-α-l-rhamnopyranosyl]-β-d-glucopyranoside-7-O-[6-O-(trans-p-coumaroyl)]-β-d-glucopyranoside (4). Their structures were established based on UV-visible, 1D, 2D NMR, and HR-ESI-MS analyses. Of the assayed compounds, 17 and 18 showed potent radical scavenging activity with IC50 values of 14.5 and 11.7 µM, respectively, and inhibitory activity toward AGEs together with compound 7 with IC50 values 96.5, 34.9 and 85.5 µM, respectively.",Differences in the Effectiveness of Long-Acting Injection and Orally Administered Antipsychotics in Reducing Rehospitalization among Patients with Schizophrenia Receiving Home Care Services.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181830,Journal of clinical medicine,2019 06 11,"The current study explored the differences in the effectiveness of first and second generation long-acting injections and orally administered antipsychotics in reducing the rehospitalization rate among patients with schizophrenia receiving home care services in a medical center in Southern Taiwan. Longitudinal data between 1 January 2006, and 31 December 2015, were collected retrospectively. Patients were classified into three treatment groups: First generation antipsychotic (FGA) long-acting injection (LAI), second generation antipsychotic long-acting injection (SGA) (LAI), and oral antipsychotics. The primary outcomes were the rehospitalization rate and the follow-up time (duration of receiving home care services) until psychiatric rehospitalization. A total of 78 patients with schizophrenia were recruited. The average observation time was about 40 months. The oral treatment group tended to be older with a higher number of female patients and a lower level of education. The FGA treatment group tended to have a higher frequency and duration of hospitalization before receiving home care services. We found no significant differences in the follow-up time or psychiatric rehospitalization rate after receiving home care services among the three treatment groups. We propose that oral and LAI antipsychotics were equally effective when patients received home care services. Our results can serve as a reference for the choice of treatment for patients with schizophrenia in a home care program.",Small RNA Functions as a Trafficking Effector in Plant Immunity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181829,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 06 11,Small RNAs represent a class of small but powerful agents that regulate development and abiotic and biotic stress responses during plant adaptation to a constantly challenging environment. Previous findings have revealed the important roles of small RNAs in diverse cellular processes. The recent discovery of bidirectional trafficking of small RNAs between different kingdoms has raised many interesting questions. The subsequent demonstration of exosome-mediated small RNA export provided a possible tool for further investigating how plants use small RNAs as a weapon during the arms race between plant hosts and pathogens. This review will focus on discussing the roles of small RNAs in plant immunity in terms of three aspects: the biogenesis of extracellular small RNAs and the transportation and trafficking small RNA-mediated gene silencing in pathogens.,Role of Cop9 Signalosome Subunits in the Environmental and Hormonal Balance of Plant.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181827,Biomolecules,2019 06 11,"The COP9 (Constitutive photomorphogenesis 9) signalosome (CSN) is a highly conserved protein complex that influences several signaling and developmental processes. The COP9 signalosome consists of eight subunits, among which two subunits, CSN5 and CSN6, contain an Mpr1/Pad1 N-terminal (MPN) domain and the remaining six subunits contain a proteasome, COP9 signalosome, and initiation factor 3 (PCI) domain. In plants, each MPN subunit is encoded by two genes, which is not the case in other organisms. This review aims to provide in-depth knowledge of each COP9 signalosome subunit, concentrating on genetic analysis of both partial and complete loss-of-function mutants. At the beginning of this review, the role of COP9 signalosome in the hormonal signaling and defense is discussed, whereas later sections deal in detail with the available partial loss-of-function, hypomorphic mutants of each subunit.

The propagation of waves that are bent downward by the ionosphere is dominated by a bi-refractive mechanism called 'magneto-ionic propagation'. The polarization of both downward waves depends on the spatial angle between the Earth's magnetic field and the direction of propagation of the radio wave. The probes and sensors described in this article are needed to simultaneously investigate signal fading and polarization dynamics on six radio wave propagation paths. The 1-Watt probes realize a 57 dB signal-to-noise ratio. The probe polarization is controlled using direct digital synthesis and the cross-polarization is 25-35 dB. The intermodulation-free dynamic range of the sensor exceeds 100 dB. Measurement speed is 3000 samples/second. This publication covers design, practical realization and deployment issues. Research performed with these devices will be shared in subsequent publications.","Isolation and Characterization of CsWRKY7, a Subgroup IId WRKY Transcription Factor from Camelliasinensis, Linked to Development in Arabidopsis.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181825,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 06 11,"WRKY transcription factors (TFs) containing one or two WRKY domains are a class of plant TFs that respond to diverse abiotic stresses and are associated with developmental processes. However, little has been known about the function of WRKY gene in tea plant. In this study, a subgroup IId WRKY gene CsWRKY7 was isolated from Camellia sinensis, which displayed amino acid sequence homology with Arabidopsis AtWRKY7 and AtWRKY15. Subcellular localization prediction indicated that CsWRKY7 localized to nucleus. Cis-acting elements detected in the promotor region of CsWRKY7 are mainly involved in plant response to environmental stress and growth. Consistently, expression analysis showed that CsWRKY7 transcripts responded to NaCl, mannitol, PEG, and diverse hormones treatments. Additionally, CsWRKY7 exhibited a higher accumulation both in old leaves and roots compared to bud. Seed germination and root growth assay indicated that overexpressed CsWRKY7 in transgenic Arabidopsis was not sensitive to NaCl, mannitol, PEG, and low concentration of ABA treatments. CsWRKY7 overexpressing Arabidopsis showed a late-flowering phenotype under normal conditions compared to wild type. Furthermore, gene expression analysis showed that the transcription levels of the flowering time integrator gene FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) and the floral meristem identity genes APETALA1 (AP1) and LEAFY (LFY) were lower in WRKY7-OE than in the WT. Taken together, these findings indicate that CsWRKY7 TF may participate in plant growth. This study provides a potential strategy to breed late-blooming tea cultivar.",Impact of Percent Body Fat on All-Cause Mortality among Adequate Dialysis Patients with and without Insulin Resistance: A Multi-Center Prospective Cohort Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181824,Nutrients,2019 06 11,"The association between body fat and mortality in hemodialysis patients remains controversial. We examined the effect of percent body fat (PBF) on all-cause mortality among adequate hemodialysis patients with and without insulin resistance (IR). A prospective cohort study was conducted on 365 adequate hemodialysis patients (equilibrated Kt/V ≥ 1.2) from seven hospitals. Patients' characteristics and clinical and biochemical parameters were assessed at baseline between September 2013 and April 2017. Patients were followed up for all-cause mortality until April 2018. The median value of homeostatic model assessment (HOMA-IR) was used to classify IR. Cox proportional hazard models were utilized to examine predictors of all-cause mortality. During 1.4 (1.0-3.2) years of follow-up, 46 patients died. In patients with IR (HOMA-IR ≥ 5.18), PBF was significantly higher in the survival group than in the death group (31.3 ± 9.0 vs. 25.4 ± 8.2, p = 0.005). After controlling for confounding factors, PBF was significantly associated with lower risk for all-cause mortality in patients with IR (hazard ratio, 0.94; 95% confidence interval, 0.89-1.00; p = 0.033). The association was not observed in patients without IR. In conclusion, percent body fat shows a protective effect on survival in hemodialysis patients with IR.",Surface Characterization and Tribological Performance of Anodizing Micro-Textured Aluminum-Silicon Alloys.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181823,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 11,"Eutectic aluminum-silicon alloys present high frictional coefficient and a high wear rate due to the low hardness under sliding friction conditions. In this paper, the eutectic aluminum-silicon alloy was textured firstly by micro-milling operations. Then, the micro-textured specimen was subjected to anodizing to fabricate alumina films. The surface topography, surface roughness, and bearing area ratio of micro-textured and anodizing micro-textured specimens were measured and characterized. For the anodizing micro-textured specimens, the surface roughness and superficial hardness increase compared with those for micro-textured ones. Tribological tests indicate that anodizing micro-textured samples present lower friction coefficient of 0.37 than that of flat samples of 0.43 under dry sliding conditions. However, they exhibit higher friction coefficient at 0.16 than that of flat samples of 0.13 under oil-lubricated conditions. The difference between the friction coefficient of anodizing micro-textured and flat samples under dry and oil-lubricated conditions is ascribed to the influence mechanism of surface roughness, bearing area ratio curves, and its relative parameters on the tribological performance of testing samples. The dry sliding friction coefficient has a positive correlation with bearing area ratio curves, while they present negative correlation with bearing area ratio curves under oil-lubricated conditions. The synergy method treated with micro-milling and anodizing provides an effective approach to enhance the dry sliding friction property of eutectic aluminum-silicon alloys.",The Use of Platelet-Rich Plasma to Promote Cell Recruitment into Low-Molecular-Weight Fucoidan-Functionalized Poly(Ester-Urea-Urethane) Scaffolds for Soft-Tissue Engineering.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181822,Polymers,2019 06 11,"Due to their elastomeric behavior, polyurethane-based scaffolds can find various applications in soft-tissue engineering. However, their relatively inert surface has to be modified in order to improve cell colonization and control cell fate. The present study focuses on porous biodegradable scaffolds based on poly(ester-urea-urethane), functionalized concomitantly to the scaffold elaboration with low-molecular-weight (LMW) fucoidan; and their bio-activation with platelet rich plasma (PRP) formulations with the aim to promote cell response. The LMW fucoidan-functionalization was obtained in a very homogeneous way, and was stable after the scaffold sterilization and incubation in phosphate-buffered saline. Biomolecules from PRP readily penetrated into the functionalized scaffold, leading to a biological frame on the pore walls. Preliminary in vitro assays were assessed to demonstrate the improvement of scaffold behavior towards cell response. The scaffold bio-activation drastically improved cell migration. Moreover, cells interacted with all pore sides into the bio-activated scaffold forming cell bridges across pores. Our work brought out an easy and versatile way of developing functionalized and bio-activated elastomeric poly(ester-urea-urethane) scaffolds with a better cell response."

The mechanisms of cisplatin hypersensitivity and resistance in embryonal carcinoma (EC), the stem cells of TGCTs, remain largely undefined. To study the mechanisms of cisplatin resistance we generated a large panel of independently derived, acquired resistant clones from three distinct parental EC models employing a protocol designed to match standard of care regimens of TGCT patients. Transcriptomics revealed highly significant expression changes shared between resistant cells regardless of their parental origin. This was dominated by a highly significant enrichment of genes normally repressed by H3K27 methylation and the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) which correlated with a substantial decrease in global H3K27me3, H2AK119 ubiquitination, and expression of BMI1. Importantly, repression of H3K27 methylation with the EZH2 inhibitor GSK-126 conferred cisplatin resistance to parental cells while induction of H3K27 methylation with the histone lysine demethylase inhibitor GSK-J4 resulted in increased cisplatin sensitivity to resistant cells. A gene signature based on H3K27me gene enrichment was associated with an increased rate of recurrent/progressive disease in testicular cancer patients. Our data indicates that repression of H3K27 methylation is a mechanism of cisplatin acquired resistance in TGCTs and that restoration of PRC2 complex function is a viable approach to overcome treatment failure.",A Candidate for Multitopic Probes for Ligand Discovery in Dynamic Combinatorial Chemistry.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181809,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 11,"Multifunctionalized materials are expected to be versatile probes to find specific interactions between a ligand and a target biomaterial. Thus, efficient methods to prepare possible combinations of the functionalities is desired. The concept of dynamic combinatorial chemistry (DCC) is ideal for the generation of any possible combination, as well as screening for target biomaterials. Here, we propose a new molecular design of multitopic probes for ligand discovery in DCC. We synthesized a new Gable Porphyrin, GP1, having prop-2-yne groups as a scaffold to introduce various functional groups. GP1 is a bis(imidazolylporphyrinatozinc) compound connected through a 1,3-phenylene moiety, and it gives macrocycles spontaneously and quantitatively by strong imidazole-to-zinc complementary coordination. Some different types of functional groups were introduced into GP1 in high yields. Formation of heterogeneous macrocycles composed of GP1 derivatives having different types of substituents was accomplished under equilibrium conditions. These results promise that enormous numbers of macrocycles having various functional groups can be provided when the kinds of GP components increase. These features are desirable for DCC, and the present system using GP1 is a potential candidate to provide a dynamic combinatorial library of multitopic probes to discover specific interactions between a ligand and a biomaterial.",Accurate Energy Modeling and Characterization of IEEE 802.11ah RAW and TWT.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181808,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 13,"Minimizing the energy consumption is one of the main challenges in iot networks. Recently, the IEEE 802.11ah standard has been released as a new low-power Wi-Fi solution. It has several features, such as raw and twt, that promise to improve energy consumption. Specifically, in this article we study how to reduce the energy consumption thanks to raw and twt. In order to do this, we first present an analytical model that calculates the average energy consumption during a raw slot. We compare these results to the IEEE 802.11ah simulator that we have extended for this scope with an energy life-cycle model for raw and twt. Then we study the energy consumption under different conditions using raw. Finally, we evaluate the energy consumption using twt. In the results, we show that the presented model has a maximum deviation from the simulations of 10% in case of ce and 7% without it. raw always performs better than csma when the traffic is higher and the usage of more slots has showed to have better energy efficiency, of up to the 76%, although also significantly increasing the latency. We will show how twt outperforms pure raw, by over 100%, when the transmission time is over 5 min.",Mow the Grass at the Mouse's Peril: Diversity of Small Mammals in Commercial Fruit Farms.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181807,Animals : an open access journal from MDPI,2019 06 11,"Small mammals are not only pests but also an important part of agricultural ecosystems. The common vole is a reference species for risk assessment of plant protection products in the European Union, but no data about the suitability of the species in the Baltic countries are present so far. Using the snap-trap line method, we evaluated species composition, abundance, and diversity of small mammal communities in commercial orchards and berry plantations in Lithuania, testing the predictions that (i) compared with other habitats, small mammal diversity in fruit farms is low, and (ii) the common vole is the dominant species. The diversity of small mammals was compared with control habitats and the results of investigations in other habitats. Out of ten small mammal species registered, the most dominant were common vole and striped field mouse. Small mammal diversity and abundance increased in autumn and decreased in line with the intensity of agricultural practices but were not dependent on crop type. In the most intensively cultivated fruit farms, small mammals were not found. The diversity of small mammal communities in fruit farms was significantly higher than in crop fields and exceeded the diversities found in most types of forests except those in rapid succession.",Preferential Response of Basal-Like Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma Cell Lines to EGFR-Targeted Therapy Depending on EREG-Driven Oncogenic Addiction.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181806,Cancers,2019 06 11,"The management of locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) with Cetuximab, a monoclonal antibody targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), achieves only moderate response rates, and clinical trials that evaluated EGFR-blockade with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) yielded disappointing results. Inter-tumor heterogeneity may hinder the therapeutic efficiency of anti-EGFR treatments. HNSCC heterogeneity was addressed in several studies, which all converged towards the definition of molecular subgroups. They include the basal subgroup, defined by the deregulated expression of factors involved in the EGFR signaling pathway, including the epiregulin EGFR ligand encoded by the EREG gene. These observations indicate that basal tumors could be more sensitive to anti-EGFR treatments. To test this hypothesis, we performed a screen of a representative collection of basal versus non-basal HNSCC cell lines for their sensitivity to several anti-EGFR drugs (Cetuximab, Afatinib, and Gefitinib), tested as monotherapy or in combination with drugs that target closely-linked pathways [Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase/ extracellular signal-regulated kinases (MEK), mammalian Target of Rapamycine (mTOR) or Human Epidermal growth factor Receptor 2 (HER2)]. Basal-like cell lines were found to be more sensitive to EGFR blockade alone or in combination with treatments that target MEK, mTOR, or HER2. Strikingly, the basal-like status was found to be a better predictor of cell response to EGFR blockade than clinically relevant mutations [e.g., cyclin-dependent kinase Inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A)]. Interestingly, we show that EGFR blockade inhibits EREG expression, and that EREG knock-down decreases basal cell clonogenic survival, suggesting that EREG expression could be a predictive functional marker of sensitivity to EGFR blockade in basal-like HNSCC.",DSPE-PEG Modification of α-Conotoxin TxID.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181805,Marine drugs,2019 06 11,"In order to improve stability of a peptide marine drug lead, α-conotoxin TxID, we synthesized and modified TxID at the N-terminal with DSPE-PEG-NHS by a nucleophilic substitution reaction to prepare the DSPE-PEG-TxID for the first time. The reaction conditions, including solvent, ratio, pH, and reaction time, were optimized systematically and the optimal one was reacted in dimethyl formamide at pH 8.2 with triethylamine at room temperature for 120 h. The in vitro stabilities in serum, simulated gastric juice, and intestinal fluid were tested, and improved dramatically compared with TxID. The PEG-modified peptide was functionally tested on α3β4 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) heterologously expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes. The DSPE-PEG-TxID showed an obvious inhibition effect on α3β4 nAChR. All in all, the PEG modification of TxID was improved in stability, resistance to enzymatic degradation, and may prolong the half-life in vivo, which may pave the way for the future application in smoking cessation and drug rehabilitation, as well as small cell lung cancer.",Oyster-Derived Zinc-Binding Peptide Modified by Plastein Reaction via Zinc Chelation Promotes the Intestinal Absorption of Zinc.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181804,Marine drugs,2019 06 11,"Zinc-binding peptides from oyster (Crassostreagigas) have potential effects on zinc supplementation. The aim of this study was to prepare efficient zinc-binding peptides from oyster-modified hydrolysates by adding exogenous glutamate according to the plastein reaction and to further explore the zinc absorption mechanism of the peptide-zinc complex (MZ). The optimum conditions for the plastein reaction were as follows: pH 5.0, 40 °C, substrate concentration of 40%, pepsin dosage of 500 U/g, reaction time of 3 h and l-[1-13C]glutamate concentration of 10 mg/mL. The results of 13C isotope labelling suggested that the addition of l-[1-13C]glutamate contributed to the increase in the zinc-binding capacity of the peptide. The hydrophobic interaction was the main mechanism of action of the plastein reaction. Ultraviolet spectra and scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) revealed that the zinc-binding peptide could bind with zinc and form MZ. Furthermore, MZ could significantly enhance zinc bioavailability in the presence of phytic acid, compared to the commonly used ZnSO4. Additionally, MZ significantly promoted the intestinal absorption of zinc mainly through two pathways, the zinc ion channel and the small peptide transport pathway. Our work attempted to increase the understanding of the zinc absorption mechanism of MZ and to support the potential application of MZ as a supplementary medicine.",Oncogenic BRAF Alterations and Their Role in Brain Tumors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181803,Cancers,2019 06 11,"Alterations of the v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B (BRAF) have been extensively studied in several tumor entities and are known to drive cell growth in several tumor entities.

Induction of Snail-driven EMT has also been shown to drive a range of pro-survival metabolic adaptations in different cancers. In the present study, we sought to determine the specific role that Snail has in driving EMT and adaptive metabolic programming in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) by overexpressing Snail in a PDAC cell line, Panc1, and in immortalized, non-tumorigenic human pancreatic ductal epithelial (HPDE) cells. Snail overexpression was able to induce EMT in both pancreatic cell lines through suppression of epithelial markers and upregulation of mesenchymal markers alongside changes in cell morphology and enhanced migratory capacity. Snail-overexpressed pancreatic cells additionally displayed increased glucose uptake and lactate production with concomitant reduction in oxidative metabolism measurements. Snail overexpression reduced maximal respiration in both Panc1 and HPDE cells, with further reductions seen in ATP production, spare respiratory capacity and non-mitochondrial respiration in Snail overexpressing Panc1 cells. Accordingly, lower expression of mitochondrial electron transport chain proteins was observed with Snail overexpression, particularly within Panc1 cells. Modelling of 13C metabolite flux within both cell lines revealed decreased carbon flux from glucose in the TCA cycle in snai1-overexpressing Panc1 cells only.

To determine the frequency and potential consequences of miRNA gene mutations, we analyzed whole exome sequencing datasets of 569 lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and 597 lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) samples generated in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project. Altogether, we identified 1091 somatic sequence variants affecting 522 different miRNA genes and showed that half of all cancers had at least one such somatic variant/mutation. These sequence variants occurred in most crucial parts of miRNA precursors, including mature miRNA and seed sequences. Due to our findings, we hypothesize that seed mutations may affect miRNA:target interactions, drastically changing the pool of predicted targets. Mutations may also affect miRNA biogenesis by changing the structure of miRNA precursors, DROSHA and DICER cleavage sites, and regulatory sequence/structure motifs. We identified 10 significantly overmutated hotspot miRNA genes, including the miR-379 gene in LUAD enriched in mutations in the mature miRNA and regulatory sequences. The occurrence of mutations in the hotspot miRNA genes was also shown experimentally. We present a comprehensive analysis of somatic variants in miRNA genes and show that some of these genes are mutational hotspots, suggesting their potential role in cancer."

The CTC recovery rate, white blood cell depletion rate, and purity of CTCs isolated using the positive and negative methods were analyzed using blood samples spiked with cancer cells with different expression levels of EpCAM. The aim was to assess the strengths and weaknesses of the positive and negative isolation methods for CTC-based diagnostics, prognostics, and therapeutics for cancer. The EpCAM-based positive method yielded CTCs of high purity, while the CD45/CD66b-based negative method yielded a large number of CTCs. In conclusion, the positive method shows promise for detecting somatic oncogenic mutations and the negative method shows promise for discovery of cellular and transcriptomic biomarkers of cancer.",Effect of Statin on Cancer Incidence: An Umbrella Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181789,Journal of clinical medicine,2019 06 11,"Statins are reported to reduce the risk of cancer, but the results of various published studies have been contradictory. We carried out an umbrella review to provide an overview and understand the strength of evidence, extent of potential biases, and validity of claimed associations between the use of statins and cancer incidence. We comprehensively re-analyzed the data of meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies on associations between statin use and cancer incidence. We also assessed the strength of evidence of the re-analyzed outcomes, which were determined from the criteria including statistical significance of the p-value of random-effects, as well as fixed-effects meta-analyses, small study effects, between-study heterogeneity, and a 95% prediction interval. Using a conventional method to assess the significance of meta-analysis (p-value < 0.05), statins had a statistically significant effect on reducing cancer incidence in 10 of 18 types of cancer. When we graded the level of evidence, no cancer type showed convincing evidence, and four cancers (esophageal cancer, hematological cancer, leukemia, and liver cancer) showed suggestive evidence of a preventive effect. There was weak evidence of an association with six cancers, and no significance for the remaining eight cancers. None of the meta-analyses of RCTs on the association of statin and cancer incidence showed a statistical significance. Although there was a preventive effect of statin on cancer incidence in 10 of the 18 cancer types, the evidence supporting the use of statins to reduce cancer incidence was low. Therefore, the associations between statin use and cancer incidence should be carefully considered by clinicians.",Factors Affecting the Welfare of Calves in Auction Markets.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181788,Animals : an open access journal from MDPI,2019 06 11,"Marketing cattle through auctions increases marketing time, exposing animals to more stressful events. Within Chile, 37% of auctioned cattle are ""calves"". To assess factors that may be affecting the welfare of calves during movement and penning, twelve markets were visited to evaluate behavioral indicators of welfare, handling, and facilities. Behavioral indicators during movement were classified into movement and other behaviors, and indicators during penning were classified into positive or negative behavioral welfare indicators. For each group of calves, an index was calculated based on a proportion of observed behavioral indicators. Statistical models were built to identify variables associated with changes in these indices. Presence of inappropriate driving, inadequate lighting, and slippery floor was associated with a movement index increase (poorer welfare). Negative tactile interactions were associated with an increase, and group size was associated with a decrease in movement index and other behavior indices. During penning, not mixing animals from different sources was associated with an increase and stocking density with a decrease in positive welfare index. Number of auctioned cattle, observation number, and not mixing with incompatible and/or with calves from different sources were factors associated with a decrease in negative welfare index, and the presence of males was associated with an increase. Behavioral welfare indicators were mostly associated with handling.",Protein Digestibility of Cereal Products.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181787,"Foods (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 11,"Protein digestibility is currently a hot research topic and is of big interest to the food industry. Different scoring methods have been developed to describe protein quality. Cereal protein scores are typically low due to a suboptimal amino acid profile and low protein digestibility. Protein digestibility is a result of both external and internal factors. Examples of external factors are physical inaccessibility due to entrapment in e.g., intact cell structures and the presence of antinutritional factors. The main internal factors are the amino acid sequence of the proteins and protein folding and crosslinking. Processing of food is generally designed to increase the overall digestibility through affecting these external and internal factors. However, with proteins, processing may eventually also lead to a decrease in digestibility. In this review, protein digestion and digestibility are discussed with emphasis on the proteins of (pseudo)cereals.",Distribution of Duffy Phenotypes among Plasmodium vivax Infections in Sudan.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181786,Genes,2019 06 11,"Negative Duffy expression on the surface of human red blood cells was believed to be a barrier for Plasmodium vivax infection in most Africans. However, P. vivax has been demonstrated to infect Duffy-negative individuals in several Central and East African countries. In this study, we investigated the distribution of Duffy blood group phenotypes with regard to P. vivax infection and parasitemia in Sudan. Out of 992 microscopic-positive malaria samples, 190 were identified as P. vivax positive infections. Among them, 186 were P. vivax mono-infections and 4 were mixed P. vivax and Plasmodium falciparum infections. A subset of 77 samples was estimated with parasitemia by quantitative real-time PCR. Duffy codons were sequenced from the 190 P. vivax positive samples. We found that the Duffy Fy(a-b+) phenotype was the most prevalent, accounting for 67.9% of all P. vivax infections, while homozygous Duffy-negative Fy(a-b-) accounted for 17.9% of the P. vivax infections. The prevalence of infection in Fy(a-b+) and Fy(a+b-)were significantly higher than Fy(a-b-) phenotypes (p = 0.01 and p < 0.01, respectively). A significantly low proportion of P. vivax infection was observed in Duffy negative individuals Fy(a-b-). This study highlights the prevalence of P. vivax in Duffy-negatives in Sudan and indicates low parasitemia among the Duffy-negative individuals.",Salivary and Serum Interferon-Gamma/Interleukin-4 Ratio in Oral Lichen Planus Patients: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181785,"Medicina (Kaunas, Lithuania)",2019 06 11,"Background and Objectives: Interferon-gamma (IFN-γ)/interleukin-4 (IL-4) ratio may indicate a change in the immune response with a potential pathological effect presented in oral lichen planus (OLP) patients. Herein, this meta-analysis evaluated the role of serum and salivary interferon-gamma/interleukin-4 ratio in the severity and development of OLP. Materials and Methods: The Scopus, Cochrane Library, PubMed, and Web of Science databases were systematically searched to retrieve the relevant studies published up from the database inception to March 2019. The crude mean difference (MD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated by RevMan 5.3 software using a random-effects model. A sensitivity analysis was performed on the results using the CMA 2.0 software. A total of 98 studies were retrieved from the databases, of which at last seven studies were included in this meta-analysis. Results: The findings showed that the pooled MDs of serum and salivary IFN-γ/IL-4 ratio were -0.22 (95% CI: -1.16, 0.72; p = 0.64) and 0.17 (95% CI: -1.50, 1.84; p = 0.84) in OLP patients compared to controls, respectively.

The multi-period network design problem within is to determine the location of waste facilities and allocation/transportation of wastes/residues in each period during the planning horizon, such that the total cost and total risk in the location and transportation procedures are minimized. With consideration of the life cycle capacity of disposal centers, we formulate the problem as a bi-objective mixed integer linear programming model in which a unified modeling strategy is designed to describe the closing of existing waste facilities and the opening of new waste facilities. By exploiting the characteristics of the proposed model, an augmented ε -constraint algorithm is developed to solve the model and find highly qualified representative non-dominated solutions. Finally, computational results of a realistic case demonstrate that our algorithm can identify obviously distinct and uniformly distributed representative non-dominated solutions within reasonable time, revealing the trade-off between the total cost and total risk objectives efficiently. Meanwhile, the multi-period network design optimization is superior to the single-period optimization in terms of the objective quality.",Rubbertown Next Generation Emissions Measurement Demonstration Project.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181783,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 06 11,"Industrial facilities and other sources can emit air pollutants from fugitive leaks, process malfunctions and area sources that can be difficult to understand and to manage. Next generation emissions measurement (NGEM) approaches executed near facilities are enabling new ways to assess these sources and their impacts to nearby populations. This paper describes complementary uses of emerging NGEM systems in a Louisville, KY industrial district (Rubbertown), focusing on an important area air toxic, 1,3-butadiene. Over a one-year deployment starting in September 2017, two-week average passive samplers (PSs) at 11 sites showed both geospatial and temporal trends. At 0.24 ppbv annual average 1,3-butadiene concentration, a group of PSs located near facility fence lines was elevated compared to a PS group located in the community and upwind from facilities (0.07 ppbv average). Two elevated PS periods capturing emission events were examined using time-resolved NGEM approaches as case studies. In one event a 1.18 ppbv PS reading was found to be relatively localized and was caused by a multiday emission from a yet to be identified, non-facility source. In the other event, the airshed was more broadly impacted with PS concentrations ranging from 0.71 ppbv for the near-facility group to 0.46 ppbv for the community group. This case was likely influenced by a known emission event at an industrial facility. For both case studies, air pollutant and wind data from prototype NGEM systems were combined with source location models to inform the emission events. This research illustrates the power of applying NGEM approaches to improve both the understanding of emissions near sources and knowledge of impacts to near-source communities.",MZF1 and SCAND1 Reciprocally Regulate CDC37 Gene Expression in Prostate Cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181782,Cancers,2019 06 11,"Cell division control 37 (CDC37) increases the stability of heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) client proteins and is thus essential for numerous intracellular oncogenic signaling pathways, playing a key role in prostate oncogenesis. Notably, elevated expression of CDC37 was found in prostate cancer cells, although the regulatory mechanisms through which CDC37 expression becomes increased are unknown. Here we show both positive and negative regulation of CDC37 gene transcription by two members of the SREZBP-CTfin51-AW1-Number 18 cDNA (SCAN) transcription factor family-MZF1 and SCAND1, respectively. Consensus DNA-binding motifs for myeloid zinc finger 1 (MZF1/ZSCAN6) were abundant in the CDC37 promoter region. MZF1 became bound to these regulatory sites and trans-activated the CDC37 gene whereas MZF1 depletion decreased CDC37 transcription and reduced the tumorigenesis of prostate cancer cells. On the other hand, SCAND1, a zinc fingerless SCAN box protein that potentially inhibits MZF1, accumulated at MZF1-binding sites in the CDC37 gene, negatively regulated the CDC37 gene and inhibited tumorigenesis. SCAND1 was abundantly expressed in normal prostate cells but was reduced in prostate cancer cells, suggesting a potential tumor suppressor role of SCAND1 in prostate cancer. These findings indicate that CDC37, a crucial protein in prostate cancer progression, is regulated reciprocally by MZF1 and SCAND1.",Clinical Impact of RANK Signalling in Ovarian Cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181781,Cancers,2019 06 11,"Ovarian cancer (OC) is a gynaecological malignancy with poor clinical outcome and limited treatment options. The receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB (RANK) pathway, activated by RANK ligand (RANKL), critically controls bone metabolism, tumourigenesis and tumour immune responses. Denosumab, a monocloncal RANKL antibody, exerts tumour-suppressive effects in mice and humans. Here, we investigated the relevance of RANK signalling in OC. RANK, RANKL and OPG expression in 192 epithelial OC tissues was compared to expression in 35 non-malignant control tissues and related to clinico-pathological characteristics. Findings were validated in a cohort of 563 OC patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). The expression of RANK, RANKL and OPG was studied in four OC cell lines and the impact of RANK ligation or blockade on OC cell proliferation was determined. RANK, RANKL and OPG were expressed in epithelial and stromal cells in OC. RANKL expression was elevated in OC tissue, particularly in BRCA1/2 mutated tumours. High RANKL expression independently predicted reduced progression-free (PFS, p = 0.017) and overall survival (OS, p = 0.007), which could be validated in the TCGA cohort (PFS, p = 0.022; OS, p = 0.046, respectively). Expression of RANK and OPG in OC cells was induced by inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and TNFα. Neither recombinant RANK ligation nor denosumab treatment affected OC cell proliferation. Our study independently links RANKL expression with poor clinical outcome in two unrelated OC cohorts. These findings implicate RANK signalling in the immunopathogenesis of OC and warrant clinical trials with denosumab in OC."

In countries where input-intensive agriculture is practiced, these developments and trends over the past decade include renewed efforts by the agrichemical industry in herbicide discovery, cultivation of crops with combined (stacked) HR traits, increasing reliance on preemergence vs. postemergence herbicides, breeding for weed-competitive crop cultivars, expansion of harvest weed seed control practices, and advances in site-specific or precision weed management. The unifying framework or strategy underlying these developments and trends is mitigation of viable weed seeds into the soil seed bank and maintaining low weed seed banks to minimize population proliferation, evolution of resistance to additional herbicidal sites of action, and spread. A key question going forward is: how much weed control is enough to consistently achieve the goal of low weed seed banks? The vision for future HR weed management programs must be sustained crop production and profitability with reduced herbicide (particularly glyphosate) dependency.",A Global Review of Animal-Visitor Interactions in Modern Zoos and Aquariums and Their Implications for Wild Animal Welfare.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181769,Animals : an open access journal from MDPI,2019 06 11,"We provide an initial insight into the occurrence and characteristics of animal-visitor interactions (AVIs) involving captive wild animals within zoos and aquaria. Using information provided online via official public websites of modern zoos and aquaria, we found that AVIs were provided by the majority of facilities. Our study revealed that a variety of AVI types were being offered. Globally, petting captive wild animals was the most prevalent AVI type advertised (n = 1241 observations, 43% (534) of facilities) and Mammalia was the most advertised taxonomic class (n = 5142; 53% (2739)). We found certain AVI types that were more commonly offered than predicted. These were opportunities to: (1) Hand feed captive wild animals in Asia, North America and Oceania; (2) ride wild animals in Europe and North America; (3) walk with or swim through wild animal enclosures in Asia; and (4) walk with wild animals in Asia and Europe. Given the global prevalence of AVIs in modern zoos and aquaria, and an apparent lack of animal welfare focused research, we provide recommendations to help effectively balance and manage captive wild animal welfare with other primary interconnected goals.",Purple: A Computational Workflow for Strategic Selection of Peptides for Viral Diagnostics Using MS-Based Targeted Proteomics.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181768,Viruses,2019 06 11,"Emerging virus diseases present a global threat to public health. To detect viral pathogens in time-critical scenarios, accurate and fast diagnostic assays are required. Such assays can now be established using mass spectrometry-based targeted proteomics, by which viral proteins can be rapidly detected from complex samples down to the strain-level with high sensitivity and reproducibility. Developing such targeted assays involves tedious steps of peptide candidate selection, peptide synthesis, and assay optimization. Peptide selection requires extensive preprocessing by comparing candidate peptides against a large search space of background proteins. Here we present Purple (Picking unique relevant peptides for viral experiments), a software tool for selecting target-specific peptide candidates directly from given proteome sequence data. It comes with an intuitive graphical user interface, various parameter options and a threshold-based filtering strategy for homologous sequences. Purple enables peptide candidate selection across various taxonomic levels and filtering against backgrounds of varying complexity. Its functionality is demonstrated using data from different virus species and strains. Our software enables to build taxon-specific targeted assays and paves the way to time-efficient and robust viral diagnostics using targeted proteomics.",Probing Slip Differential Heat of Magnetorheological Fluids Subjected to Shear Mode Operation and Its Effect on the Structure.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181767,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 11,"The paper probes slip differential heat of magnetorheological fluids (MRFs) subjected to shear mode operation and its effect on the structure. To begin, we present a novel model for measurement of slip differential heat to describe temperature rise of MRFs mainly caused by friction between magnetorheological particles. It includes two stages: (1) The micro-macro analysis of slip differential heat of MRFs including force, movement and heat between neighboring particles based on magnetic dipole and Hertzian contact theories, and (2) the further application to two basic disc-type and cylinder-type magnetorheological clutches combined with finite element simulations involving electromagnetic field and thermal analysis. The model takes into account the effect of each of the main influencing factors, such as the input current of excitation coil, the rotational speed difference of the clutches, the size and volume fraction of particles, the saturation magnetization of particles, and the structural size of the clutches, etc., on the slip differential heat of MRFs. Then the thermal structure analysis of MRFs comprising thermal deformation and equivalent thermal stress is carried out. Moreover, the effect of typical governing parameters on the slip power of MRFs and the influence of slip differential heat on the structure of MRFs are investigated individually. We show that such a model is effective in reflecting the temperature-slip time relation of MRFs. It is shown that the input current and the rotational speed difference have great effect on the slip power, and the slip differential heat has a certain influence on the micro-structure of MRFs.",Efficient Fabrication Process of Ordered Metal Nanodot Arrays for Infrared Plasmonic Sensor.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181766,Micromachines,2019 06 11,"In this paper, a simple process to fabricate ordered Au nanodot arrays up to 520 nm in diameter that respond to infrared light is developed, and the feasibility of its application to infrared plasmonic sensors is shown. The developed process utilizes thermal dewetting to agglomerate a coated gold film into nanodots. It was difficult to produce large nanodots that responded to infrared light owing to dot separation. In this paper, therefore, the mechanism of dot agglomeration by thermal dewetting is studied via an experiment and theoretical model, and conditions to form single nanodots are clarified. Furthermore, Au nanodot arrays of 100 nm to 520 nm in diameter were fabricated by this process, and their absorption spectra were analyzed. In addition, an analysis of the change in the peak wavelength against the refractive index indicates the possibility of further improvement of the sensitivity of the infrared plasmon sensors.",Nutrient Intakes from Meals and Snacks Differ with Age in Middle-Aged and Older Americans.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181765,Nutrients,2019 06 11,"The present study investigated the meal patterns across demographic characteristics in middle-aged and older US adults. Study participants were noninstitutionalized participants from the 2005-2016 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, an observational cross-sectional study. Data from 17,361 adults were categorized into 45-59 years (n = 7366), 60-70 years (n = 5348), and 71+ years (n = 4647) to compare demographics, nutrient intakes, and meal patterns. Dietary recalls were collected using the multiple-pass method. Data analyses were weighted to create a nationally representative sample. Two-thirds of adults reported consuming three meals on the day of intake. Lunch was the most often skipped meal across all age groups. A greater proportion of adults over 70 years reported consuming breakfast, while a smaller proportion reported consuming snacks. Significant differences were observed in total energy and nutrient intakes and proportion of the day's intakes by meal. Grain, milk, and dairy food group intakes were highest at breakfast, while the protein food group intakes were highest at lunch and dinner. Age-related differences in meal consumption and composition provide valuable formative data to support targeted nutritional education and intervention opportunities to promote and encourage healthy food choices.","Surface Modification by Polyzwitterions of the Sulfabetaine-Type, and Their Resistance to Biofouling.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181764,Polymers,2019 06 11,"Films of zwitterionic polymers are increasingly explored for conferring fouling resistance to materials. Yet, the structural diversity of polyzwitterions is rather limited so far, and clear structure-property relationships are missing. Therefore, we synthesized a series of new polyzwitterions combining ammonium and sulfate groups in their betaine moieties, so-called poly(sulfabetaine)s. Their chemical structures were varied systematically, the monomers carrying methacrylate, methacrylamide, or styrene moieties as polymerizable groups. High molar mass homopolymers were obtained by free radical polymerization. Although their solubilities in most solvents were very low, brine and lower fluorinated alcohols were effective solvents in most cases. A set of sulfabetaine copolymers containing about 1 mol % (based on the repeat units) of reactive benzophenone methacrylate was prepared, spin-coated onto solid substrates, and photo-cured. The resistance of these films against the nonspecific adsorption by two model proteins (bovine serum albumin-BSA, fibrinogen) was explored, and directly compared with a set of references. The various polyzwitterions reduced protein adsorption strongly compared to films of poly(nbutyl methacrylate) that were used as a negative control. The poly(sulfabetaine)s showed generally even somewhat higher anti-fouling activity than their poly(sulfobetaine) analogues, though detailed efficacies depended on the individual polymer-protein pairs. Best samples approach the excellent performance of a poly(oligo(ethylene oxide) methacrylate) reference.",Memristor Neural Network Training with Clock Synchronous Neuromorphic System.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181763,Micromachines,2019 06 11,"Memristor devices are considered to have the potential to implement unsupervised learning, especially spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), in the field of neuromorphic hardware research. In this study, a neuromorphic hardware system for multilayer unsupervised learning was designed, and unsupervised learning was performed with a memristor neural network. We showed that the nonlinear characteristic memristor neural network can be trained by unsupervised learning only with the correlation between inputs and outputs. Moreover, a method to train nonlinear memristor devices in a supervised manner, named guide training, was devised. Memristor devices have a nonlinear characteristic, which makes implementing machine learning algorithms, such as backpropagation, difficult. The guide-training algorithm devised in this paper updates the synaptic weights by only using the correlations between inputs and outputs, and therefore, neither complex mathematical formulas nor computations are required during the training. Thus, it is considered appropriate to train a nonlinear memristor neural network. All training and inference simulations were performed using the designed neuromorphic hardware system. With the system and memristor neural network, the image classification was successfully done using both the Hebbian unsupervised training and guide supervised training methods.",An Ontology to Standardize Research Output of Nutritional Epidemiology: From Paper-Based Standards to Linked Content.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181762,Nutrients,2019 06 11,"The use of linked data in the Semantic Web is a promising approach to add value to nutrition research.

Postprandial lipemia, which is mainly related to the increase in chylomicron production, is frequently elevated in individuals at high cardiovascular risk such as obese or overweight patients, type 2 diabetic patients and subjects with a metabolic syndrome who share an insulin resistant state. It is now well known that chylomicron production and thus postprandial lipemia is highly regulated by many factors such as endogenous factors: circulating factors such as hormones or free fatty acids, genetic variants, circadian rhythms, or exogenous factors: food components, dietary supplements and prescription drugs. In this review, we focused on the effect of nutrients, micronutrients and phytochemicals but also on food structure on chylomicron production and postprandial lipemia."

In 2015, a novel GII.P16-GII.4 Sydney recombinant strain emerged, replacing the predominance of GII.Pe-GII.4 Sydney among US outbreaks. Distinct from GII.P16 polymerases detected since 2010, this novel GII.P16 was subsequently detected among GII.1, GII.2, GII.3, GII.10 and GII.12 viruses, prompting an investigation on the unique characteristics of these viruses. Norovirus positive samples (n = 1807) were dual-typed, of which a subset (n = 124) was sequenced to yield near-complete genomes. CaliciNet and National Outbreak Reporting System (NORS) records were matched to link outbreak characteristics and case outcomes to molecular data and GenBank was mined for contextualization. Recombination with the novel GII.P16 polymerase extended GII.4 Sydney predominance and increased the number of GII.2 outbreaks in the US. Introduction of the novel GII.P16 noroviruses occurred without unique amino acid changes in VP1, more severe case outcomes, or differences in affected population. However, unique changes were found among NS1/2, NS4 and VP2 proteins, which have immune antagonistic functions, and the RdRp. Multiple polymerase-capsid combinations were detected among GII viruses including 11 involving GII.P16. Molecular surveillance of protein sequences from norovirus genomes can inform the functional importance of amino acid changes in emerging recombinant viruses and aid in vaccine and antiviral formulation.",Measurement of Diffusion and Segregation in Semiconductor Quantum Dots and Quantum Wells by Transmission Electron Microscopy: A Guide.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181748,"Nanomaterials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 11,"Strategies are discussed to distinguish interdiffusion and segregation and to measure key parameters such as diffusivities and segregation lengths in semiconductor quantum dots and quantum wells by electron microscopy methods.

The molecular mechanisms leading to NMJ formation and maintenance have not yet been fully elucidated. During the last decade, it has become clear that virtually all cells release different types of extracellular vesicles (EVs), which can be taken up by nearby or distant cells modulating their activity. Initially, EVs were associated to a mechanism involved in the elimination of unwanted material; subsequent evidence demonstrated that exosomes, and more in general EVs, play a key role in intercellular communication by transferring proteins, lipids, DNA and RNA to target cells. Recently, EVs have emerged as potent carriers for Wnt, bone morphogenetic protein, miRNA secretion and extracellular traveling. Convincing evidence demonstrates that presynaptic terminals release exosomes that are taken up by muscle cells, and these exosomes can modulate synaptic plasticity in the recipient muscle cell in vivo. Furthermore, recent data highlighted that EVs could also be a potential cause of neurodegenerative disorders. Indeed, mutant SOD1, TDP-43 and FUS/TLS can be secreted by neural cells packaged into EVs and enter in neighboring neural cells, contributing to the onset and severity of the disease.",In Vivo Comparative Study on Acute and Sub-acute Biological Effects Induced by Ultrafine Particles of Different Anthropogenic Sources in BALB/c Mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181746,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 06 11,"Exposure to ultrafine particles (UFPs) leads to adverse effects on health caused by an unbalanced ratio between UFPs deposition and clearance efficacy. Since air pollution toxicity is first direct to cardiorespiratory system, we compared the acute and sub-acute effects of diesel exhaust particles (DEP) and biomass burning-derived particles (BB) on bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid (BALf), lung and heart parenchyma. Markers of cytotoxicity, oxidative stress and inflammation were analysed in male BALB/c mice submitted to single and repeated intra-tracheal instillations of 50 μg UFPs. This in-vivo study showed the activation of inflammatory response (COX-2 and MPO) after exposure to UFPs, both in respiratory and cardiovascular systems. Exposure to DEP results also in pro- and anti-oxidant (HO-1, iNOS, Cyp1b1, Hsp70) protein levels increase, although, stress persist only in cardiac tissue under repeated instillations. Statistical correlations suggest that stress marker variation was probably due to soluble components and/or mediators translocation of from first deposition site. This mechanism, appears more important after repeated instillations, since inflammation and oxidative stress endure only in heart. In summary, chemical composition of UFPs influenced the activation of different responses mediated by their components or pro-inflammatory and pro-oxidative molecules, indicating DEP as the most damaging pollutant in the comparison.",A Feature-Based Model for the Identification of Electrical Devices in Smart Environments.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181745,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 13,"Smart Homes (SHs) represent the human side of a Smart Grid (SG).

Advanced monitoring and control mechanisms are necessary to deal with the identification of appliances. In this paper, a model for their automatic identification is proposed. It is based on a set of 19 features that are extracted by analyzing energy consumption, time usage and location from a set of device profiles. Then, machine learning approaches are employed by experimenting different classifiers based on such model for the identification of appliances and, finally, an analysis on the feature importance is provided.","The Effects of Filter's Class, Cutoff Frequencies, and Independent Component Analysis on the Amplitude of Somatosensory Evoked Potentials Recorded from Healthy Volunteers.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181744,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 11,The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of different preprocessing parameters on the amplitude of median nerve somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs).,Co-Assembly of 40S and 60S Ribosomal Proteins in Early Steps of Eukaryotic Ribosome Assembly.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181743,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 06 11,"In eukaryotes three of the four ribosomal RNA (rRNA) molecules are transcribed as a long precursor that is processed into mature rRNAs concurrently with the assembly of ribosomal subunits. However, the relative timing of association of ribosomal proteins with the ribosomal precursor particles and the cleavage of the precursor rRNA into the subunit-specific moieties is not known. To address this question, we searched for ribosomal precursors containing components from both subunits. Particles containing specific ribosomal proteins were targeted by inducing synthesis of epitope-tagged ribosomal proteins followed by pull-down with antibodies targeting the tagged protein. By identifying other ribosomal proteins and internal rRNA transcribed spacers (ITS1 and ITS2) in the immuno-purified ribosomal particles, we showed that eS7/S7 and uL4/L4 bind to nascent ribosomes prior to the separation of 40S and 60S specific segments, while uS4/S9, uL22, and eL13/L13 are bound after, or simultaneously with, the separation. Thus, the incorporation of ribosomal proteins from the two subunits begins as a co-assembly with a single rRNA molecule, but is finished as an assembly onto separate precursors for the two subunits.","Feeding Enrichment in a Captive Pack of European Wolves (Canis Lupus Lupus): Assessing the Effects on Welfare and on a Zoo's Recreational, Educational and Conservational Role.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181742,Animals : an open access journal from MDPI,2019 06 11,"This study investigated the effects of two feeding enrichment programs on the behaviour of a captive pack of European wolves (Canis lupus lupus) and their correlation with both zoo visitors' interest towards the exhibit and their overall perception of the species. Behavioural data (exploration, stereotypies, social interactions, activity/inactivity rates) were collected on four male wolves during four two-week long phases: initial control, hidden food, novel object, final control. Three observation sessions were performed daily: before, during and after feeding. Number of visitors and their permanence in front of the exhibit were recorded. After watching the wolves, visitors were asked to fill out a brief questionnaire in order to investigate their perception of captive wolf welfare, as well as their attitude towards wolf conservation issues. Despite the high inter-individual variability in their behavioural response, all wolves seemed to benefit from feeding enrichment. With regard to visitors, interest in the exhibit increased when enrichment was provided. Visitors' perception of the level of welfare of wolves improved if they attended a feeding session, especially during the novel object phase. Visitors' attitude towards wolf conservation issues also improved during feeding sessions, regardless of enrichment provision.",On the Use of Ultrafiltration or Microfiltration Polymeric Spiral-Wound Membranes for Cheesemilk Standardization: Impact on Process Efficiency.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181741,"Foods (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 11,"Ultrafiltration (UF) and microfiltration (MF) are widely-used technologies to standardize the protein content of cheesemilk. Our previous work demonstrated that protein retention of a 0.1-µm MF spiral-wound membrane (SWM) was lower, but close to that of a 10 kDa UF one. Considering that the permeability of MF membranes is expected to be higher than that of UF ones, it was hypothesized that the former could improve the efficiency of the cheesemaking process. Consequently, the objectives of this work were to compare 0.1-µm MF and 10 kDa UF spiral-wound membranes in terms of (1) hydraulic and separation performance, (2) energy consumption and fouling behavior, (3) cheesemaking efficiency of retentates enriched with cream, and (4) economic performance in virtual cheesemaking plants. This study confirmed the benefits of using MF spiral-wound membranes to reduce the specific energy consumption of the filtration process (lower hydraulic resistance and higher membrane permeability) and to enhance the technological performance of the cheesemaking process (higher vat yield, and protein and fat recoveries). However, considering the higher serum protein retention of the UF membrane and the low price of electricity in Canada, the UF scenario remained more profitable. It only becomes more efficient to substitute the 10 kDa UF SWM by the 0.1-μm MF when energy costs are substantially higher.",Changes in Serum Amyloid A (SAA) Concentration in Arabian Endurance Horses During First Training Season.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181740,Animals : an open access journal from MDPI,2019 06 11,"Sport training leads to adaptation to physical effort that is reflected by the changes in blood parameters.

This study is the first longitudinal investigation of the changes in routinely measured blood parameters and, additionally, serum amyloid A (SAA), during seven months, in Arabian horses introduced to endurance training and competing in events for young horses. It has been determined that CPK, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), packed cell volume (PCV), hemoglobin concentration, red blood cell count (RBC), and concentration of total serum protein (TSP) slightly increased after training sessions and competitions in similar manner. The increase in white blood cell (WBC) count was higher after competitions and SAA increased only after competitions. Total protein concentration was the only parameter that increased with training during a 7-month program. SAA indicated only in the case of heavy effort, and, it thus may be helpful in the monitoring of training in young horses. In an optimal program, its concentration should not increase after a training session but only after heavy effort, which should not be repeated too often."

These exosomes harbor several immune-related non-coding RNAs and proteins that drive immune-escape and tumor progression, and thus may serve as potential diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for HCC.

Methods: We performed a longitudinal, randomized controlled intervention study to investigate the effects of recreational winter exercise on allergic airway inflammation, quality of life, spirometry and cardiorespiratory fitness in adults suffering from allergic rhinitis and/or asthma. The exercise group participated in a ten-day winter sports program. The control group did not receive any intervention. Results: A significant improvement of fractional oral exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO; p = 0.008, day 10) and a significant decrease in FeNO after a single 4 h hiking tour (p < 0.001, time effect) were observed for the exercise group. The nasal eosinophilic cell count revealed a short-term reduction (p = 0.021, treatment effect) in the exercise group and for the visual analogue scale sustainable improvements in allergic symptoms (p < 0.001, day 60) were found. No adverse effects of outdoor winter exercise were observed. Conclusion: Recreational winter exercise at moderately cold temperatures reduces allergic airway inflammation measured as FeNO, nasal eosinophilic cell count and induces sustainable improvements in allergic symptoms.","ZBTB46, SPDEF, and ETV6: Novel Potential Biomarkers and Therapeutic Targets in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181727,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 06 11,"Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second most common killer among men in Western countries. Targeting androgen receptor (AR) signaling by androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is the current therapeutic regime for patients newly diagnosed with metastatic PCa. However, most patients relapse and become resistant to ADT, leading to metastatic castration-resistant PCa (CRPC) and eventually death. Several proposed mechanisms have been proposed for CRPC; however, the exact mechanism through which CRPC develops is still unclear. One possible pathway is that the AR remains active in CRPC cases. Therefore, understanding AR signaling networks as primary PCa changes into metastatic CRPC is key to developing future biomarkers and therapeutic strategies for PCa and CRPC. In the current review, we focused on three novel biomarkers (ZBTB46, SPDEF, and ETV6) that were demonstrated to play critical roles in CRPC progression, epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR TKI) drug resistance, and the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) for patients treated with ADT or AR inhibition. In addition, we summarize how these potential biomarkers can be used in the clinic for diagnosis and as therapeutic targets of PCa.","Synthesis and Cytotoxicity of 7,9-O-Linked Macrocyclic C-Seco Taxoids.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181726,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 11,"A series of novel 7,9-O-linked macrocyclic taxoids together with modification at the C2 position were synthesized, and their cytotoxicities against drug-sensitive and P-glycoprotein and βIII-tubulin overexpressed drug-resistant cancer cell lines were evaluated.

Although cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) is sensitive to waterlogging, its ability to generate adventitious roots facilitates gas diffusion and increases plant survival when oxygen concentrations are low. To understand the physiological responses to waterlogging, a 10-day waterlogging experiment was conducted. The objective of this study was to measure the photosynthetic and key metabolites of cucumber plants under waterlogging conditions for 10 days. Plants were also harvested at the end of 10 days and analyzed for plant height (ht), leaf number and area, fresh mass (FM), dry mass (DM), chlorophyll (Chl), carotenoid (CAR), proline, and soluble sugars. Results indicated that cucumber plants subjected to the 10-day waterlogging stress conditions were stunted, had fewer leaves, and decreased leaf area, FM, and DM. There were differences in physiological performance, Chl, CAR, proline, and soluble sugars. Overall, waterlogging stress decreased net photosynthesis (A), having a negative effect on biomass accumulation. However, these decreases were also dependent on other factors, such as plant size, morphology, and water use efficiency (WUE) that played a role in the overall metabolism of the plant.",Gasotransmitters in Action: Nitric Oxide-Ethylene Crosstalk during Plant Growth and Abiotic Stress Responses.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181724,"Antioxidants (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 11,"Since their first description as atmospheric gases, it turned out that both nitric oxide (NO) and ethylene (ET) are multifunctional plant signals. ET and polyamines (PAs) use the same precursor for their synthesis, and NO can be produced from PA oxidation. Therefore, an indirect metabolic link between NO and ET synthesis can be considered. NO signal is perceived primarily through S-nitrosation without the involvement of a specific receptor, while ET signal is sensed by a well-characterized receptor complex. Both NO and ET are synthetized by plants at various developmental stages (e.g., seeds, fruits) and as a response to numerous environmental factors (e.g., heat, heavy metals) and they mutually regulate each other's levels. Most of the growth and developmental processes (e.g., fruit ripening, de-etiolation) are regulated by NO-ET antagonism, while in abiotic stress responses, both antagonistic (e.g., dark-induced stomatal opening, cadmium-induced cell death) and synergistic (e.g., UV-B-induced stomatal closure, iron deficiency-induced expression of iron acquisition genes) NO-ET interplays have been revealed. Despite the numerous pieces of experimental evidence revealing NO-ET relationships in plants, the picture is far from complete.

In the cases of water and water rich mixtures including biological systems, a GHz frequency relaxation process appearing at around 20 GHz with the relaxation time of 8.2 ps is generally observed at 25 °C. The GHz frequency process can be explained as a rate process of exchanges in hydrogen bond (HB) and the rate becomes higher with increasing HB density. In the present work, this study analyzed the GHz frequency process observed by suitable open-ended coaxial electrodes, and physical meanings of the fractal nature of water structures were clarified in various aqueous systems. Dynamic behaviors of HBN were characterized by a combination of the average relaxation time and the distribution of the relaxation time. This fractal analysis offered an available approach to both solution and dispersion systems with characterization of the aggregation or dispersion state of water molecules. In the case of polymer-water mixtures, the HBN and polymer networks penetrate each other, however, the HBN were segmented and isolated more by dispersed and aggregated particles in the case of dispersion systems. These HBN fragments were characterized by smaller values of the fractal dimension obtained from the fractal analysis. Some examples of actual usages suggest that the fractal analysis is now one of the most effective tools to understand the molecular mechanism of HBN in aqueous complex materials including biological systems.",Improving the Accuracy of Two-Color Multiview (2CMV) Advanced Geospatial Information (AGI) Products Using Unsupervised Feature Learning and Optical Flow.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181721,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 13,"In two-color multiview (2CMV) advanced geospatial information (AGI) products, temporal changes in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images acquired at different times are detected, colorized, and overlaid on an initial image such that new features are represented in cyan, and features that have disappeared are represented in red. Accurate detection of temporal changes in 2CMV AGI products can be challenging because of 'speckle noise' susceptibility and false positives that result from small orientation differences between objects imaged at different times. Accordingly, 2CMV products are often dominated by colored pixels when changes are detected via simple pixel-wise cross-correlation. The state-of-the-art in SAR image processing demonstrates that generating efficient 2CMV products, while accounting for the aforementioned problem cases, has not been well addressed. We propose a methodology to address the aforementioned two problem cases. Before detecting temporal changes, speckle and smoothing filters mitigate the effects of speckle noise. To detect temporal changes, we propose using unsupervised feature learning algorithms in conjunction with optical flow algorithms that track the motion of objects across time in small regions of interest. The proposed framework for distinguishing between actual motion and misregistration can lead to more accurate and meaningful change detection and improve object extraction from an SAR AGI product.",Interpersonal Sensitivity and Loneliness among Chinese Gay Men: A Cross-Sectional Survey.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181720,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 06 11,"To understand the current status of, and factors related to interpersonal sensitivity (IS) and loneliness among Chinese gay men.

Previous reports rely on a two-step ball-milling process and/or time-consuming annealing. Aiming for a faster and scalable fabrication route, herein, we investigated other potential synthesis routes and their impact on the thermoelectric properties of α-MgAgSb. We started from a gas-atomized MgAg precursor and employed ball-milling only in the final mixing step. Direct comparison of high energy ball-milling and planetary ball-milling revealed that high energy ball milling already induced formation of MgAgSb, while planetary ball milling did not. This had a strong impact on the microstructure and secondary phase fraction, resulting in superior performance of the high energy ball milling route with an attractive average thermoelectric figure of merit of z T avg = 0.9. We also show that the formation of undesired secondary phases cannot be avoided by a modification of the sintering temperature after planetary ball milling, and discuss the influence of commonly observed secondary phases on the carrier mobility and on the thermoelectric properties of α-MgAgSb.",Conformational Studies of Glucose Transporter 1 (GLUT1) as an Anticancer Drug Target.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181707,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 11,"Glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) is a facilitative glucose transporter overexpressed in various types of tumors; thus, it has been considered as an important target for cancer therapy. GLUT1 works through conformational switching from an outward-open (OOP) to an inward-open (IOP) conformation passing through an occluded conformation. It is critical to determine which conformation is preferred by bound ligands because the success of structure-based drug design depends on the appropriate starting conformation of the target protein. To find out the most favorable GLUT 1 conformation for ligand binding, we ran systemic molecular docking studies for different conformations of GLUT1 using known GLUT1 inhibitors. Our data revealed that the IOP is the preferred conformation and that residues Phe291, Phe379, Glu380, Trp388, and Trp412 may play critical roles in ligand binding to GLUT1. Our data suggests that conformational differences in these five amino acids in the different conformers of GLUT1 may be used to design ligands that inhibit GLUT1.",Ultrasonographic Evaluation of The Effects of Orthodontic or Functional Orthopaedic Treatment on Masseter Muscles: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181706,"Medicina (Kaunas, Lithuania)",2019 06 11,"Objectives: This review investigated the effects of orthodontic or functional orthopedic therapy on masseter muscle thickness through the use of ultrasonography (US) in growing subjects when compared with untreated subjects. MaterialsandMethods: This review systematically assessed studies that investigated growing subjects undergoing orthopedic therapy for the correction of malocclusion of vertical, sagittal and transversal plane. Electronic databases (CENTRAL, MEDLINE-PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science) were searched up to February 2019, including available RCTs and CCTs, without language restrictions. The primary outcome was the effect of orthopedic or functional treatment on masseter muscle thickness. The risk of bias of included studies was assessed through the Newcastle-Ottawa quality assessment scale with the aim of defining their methodological quality. A random-effects meta-analysis analyzing mean differences with 95% confidence intervals was used for quantitative analysis. Results: The search retrieved 749 titles, but the studies selection resulted in a final sample of 5 CCTs. The studies retrieved data from 233 children (age range: 5-22 years) and were conducted at university dental clinics. Children were treated for Class II malocclusion, increased vertical dimension or lateral cross-bite variably with rapid or slow maxillary expansion, twin block, bite block, mandibular activators, quad helix, alone or in combination. Risk of bias was assessed as medium for three studies, low for one and high for another. The meta-analysis determined that at the end of orthopedic or functional treatment masseter muscle thickness, measured through the use of US, is significantly reduced (MD -0.79 mm; 95% CI -1.28 to -0.31). The reduction in muscle thickness, therefore, could be considered an indicator for the evaluation of the success of therapy with orthodontic appliances. Conclusions: Although the meta-analysis revealed that US could be considered a less invasive and effective method to evaluate the masseter muscle thickness, single-blinded RCTs, are required to confirm US reliability in this field of application.

Therefore, novel digital tools are discussed to improve health-related behaviors. The use of smartphone applications (apps) and wearables (e.g., activity trackers) for self-monitoring of diet and physical activity might have an impact on body weight. By now, the scientific evaluation of apps and wearables for weight management is limited. Although some intervention studies have already investigated the efficacy of aforementioned digital tools on weight management, there are no clear recommendations for its clinical and therapeutic use . Besides the lack in long-term randomized controlled trials, there are also concerns regarding the scientific quality of apps and wearables (e.g., no standards for development and evaluation). Therefore, the objective of present work is: (1) To address challenges and concerns regarding the current digital health market and (2) to provide a selective overview about intervention studies using apps and activity trackers for weight-related outcomes. Based on cited literature, the efficacy of apps and wearables on weight management is assessed. Finally, it is intended to derive potential recommendations for practical guidance.",Constraint-Based Optimized Human Skeleton Extraction from Single-Depth Camera.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181704,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 11,"As a cutting-edge research topic in computer vision and graphics for decades, human skeleton extraction from single-depth camera remains challenging due to possibly occurring occlusions of different body parts, huge appearance variations, and sensor noise. In this paper, we propose to incorporate human skeleton length conservation and symmetry priors as well as temporal constraints to enhance the consistency and continuity for the estimated skeleton of a moving human body. Given an initial estimation of the skeleton joint positions provided per frame by the Kinect SDK or Nuitrack SDK, which do not follow the aforementioned priors and can prone to errors, our framework improves the accuracy of these pose estimates based on the length and symmetry constraints. In addition, our method is device-independent and can be integrated into skeleton extraction SDKs for refinement, allowing the detection of outliers within the initial joint location estimates and predicting new joint location estimates following the temporal observations. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach in several cases.",Comparison of Different Polarization Sensitive Second Harmonic Generation Imaging Techniques.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181703,Methods and protocols,2019 06 11,"Polarization sensitive second harmonic generation (pSHG) microscopy is an imaging technique able to provide, in a non-invasive manner, information related to the molecular structure of second harmonic generation (SHG) active structures, many of which are commonly found in biological tissue. The process of acquiring this information by means of pSHG microscopy requires a scan of the sample using different polarizations of the excitation beam. This process can take considerable time in comparison with the dynamics of in vivo processes. Fortunately, single scan polarization sensitive second harmonic generation (SS-pSHG) microscopy has also been reported, and is able to generate the same information at a faster speed compared to pSHG. In this paper, the orientation of second harmonic active supramolecular assemblies in starch granules is obtained on by means of pSHG and SS-pSHG. These results are compared in the forward and backward directions, showing a good agreement in both techniques. This paper shows for the first time, to the best of the authors' knowledge, data acquired using both techniques over the exact same sample and image plane, so that they can be compared pixel-to-pixel.",Optimization of Pectin Enzymatic Extraction from Malus domestica 'Fălticeni' Apple Pomace with Celluclast 1.5L.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181702,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 11,": Pectin was extracted from apple (Malus domestica 'Fălticeni') pomace with Celluclast 1.5L, at doses of 20, 40, and 60 µL/g of material. The temperature and time of extraction were varied on three levels-temperature-40, 50, and 60 °C; time-12, 18, and 24 h. For each experiment, the extraction yield (R2 = 0.8905), the galacturonic acid content (R2 = 0.9866), and the degree of esterification (R2 = 0.9520) of pectin was determined. Response surface methodology (RSM) was implemented via a Box-Behnken design, to optimize pectin extraction. In the optimum extraction conditions (temperature of 48.3 °C, extraction time of 18 h 14 min, and enzyme dose of 42.5 µL/g of pomace), the design predicted a 6.76% yield with a galacturonic acid content of 97.46 g/100 g of pectin and a degree of esterification of 96.02%. FT-IR analysis of the pectin sample obtained in these conditions showed a chemical structure similar to that of commercial apple and citrus pectin.",Development of a Virtual Force Sensor for a Low-Cost Collaborative Robot and Applications to Safety Control.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181701,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 13,"To protect operators and conform to safety standards for human-machine interactions, the design of collaborative robot arms often incorporates flexible mechanisms and force sensors to detect and absorb external impact forces. However, this approach increases production costs, making the introduction of such robot arms into low-cost service applications difficult. This study proposes a low-cost, sensorless rigid robot arm design that employs a virtual force sensor and stiffness control to enable the safety collision detection and low-precision force control of robot arms. In this design, when a robot arm is subjected to an external force while in motion, the contact force observer estimates the external torques on each joint according to the motor electric current and calculation errors of the system model, which are then used to estimate the external contact force exerted on the robot arm's end-effector. Additionally, a torque saturation limiter is added to the servo drive for each axis to enable the real-time adjustment of joint torque output according to the estimated external force, regulation of system stiffness, and achievement of impedance control that can be applied in safety measures and force control. The design this study developed is a departure from the conventional multisensor flexible mechanism approach. Moreover, it is a low-cost and sensorless design that relies on model-based control for stiffness regulation, thereby improving the safety and force control in robot arm applications.",Chronic Inflammation as an Immunological Abnormality and Effectiveness of Exercise.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181700,Biomolecules,2019 06 11,"Reduced levels of physical activity in people's daily lives cause the development of metabolic syndromes or age-related disorders. Chronic inflammation is now understood to be an underlying pathological condition in which inflammatory cells such as neutrophils and monocyte/macrophages infiltrate into fat and other tissues and accumulate when people become obese due to overeating and/or physical inactivity. Pro-inflammatory mediators such as cytokines that are secreted in excess from inflammatory cells will not only lead to the development of arteriosclerosis when they chronically affect blood vessels but also bring tissue degeneration and/or dysfunction to various organs. Chronic inflammation is also involved in sarcopenia that brings hypofunction in the elderly, dementia, osteoporosis, or cancer and negatively affects many chronic diseases and people's healthy life expectancy. In this paper, outlines of such studies are introduced in terms of homeostatic inflammation, which occurs chronically due to the innate immune system and its abnormalities, while focusing on the efficacy of exercise from aspects of immunology and oxidative stress. The preventative effects of functional food ingredients in combination with exercise are also introduced and described. The challenges and future directions in understanding the role of exercise in the control of chronic inflammation are discussed.","The Diversity, Multiplicity of Infection and Population Structure of P. falciparum Parasites Circulating in Asymptomatic Carriers Living in High and Low Malaria Transmission Settings of Ghana.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181699,Genes,2019 06 11,": Background: Diversity in Plasmodium falciparum poses a major threat to malaria control and elimination interventions.

Equally promising are the effects of silymarin in protecting the brain from the inflammatory and oxidative stress effects by which metabolic syndrome contributes to neurodegenerative diseases. However, although clinical trials have proved that silymarin is safe at high doses (>1500 mg/day) in humans, it suffers limiting factors such as low solubility in water (<50 μg/mL), low bioavailability and poor intestinal absorption. To improve its bioavailability and provide a prolonged silymarin release at the site of absorption, the use of nanotechnological strategies appears to be a promising method to potentiate the therapeutic action and promote sustained release of the active herbal extract. The purpose of this study is to review the different nanostructured systems available in literature as delivery strategies to improve the absorption and bioavailability of silymarin.","Analyzing Municipal Solid Waste Treatment Scenarios in Rapidly Urbanizing Cities in Developing Countries: The Case of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181686,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 06 11,"Currently, large quantities of municipal solid waste (MSW) in many cities of the developing countries are being dumped in informal or formal but unregulated dumpsites that threaten the ecological environment and general public health. The situation in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania is of particular concern and is further challenged by a rapidly growing population and urbanization without adequate waste management systems. Current MSW treatment options have been selected based on the judgment and the experience of individuals with authority while underestimating the role of scientifically derived techniques. This study analyzes the most efficient waste treatment options, particularly scenarios with the lowest economic and environmental costs (EcC and EnC, respectively). It uses 12 years (2006-2017) of MSW management data and compares potential waste treatment options for the identified waste streams. A total of 108 different scenarios were designed, and a multi-criteria analysis method was applied to enable the identification of 11 scenarios with acceptable EcCs and EnCs. These formed an initial decision matrix of aggregation dominance that was then categorized into four groups, each represented by the most ideal point. Finally, the dominant scenario that formed the core for all considered options was found. It costs around $274,100 USD while saving about 1585 metric tons (MT) of CO2 emissions daily. This suggests that after all the MSW generated in the city is collected and segregated, organic waste should be composted whilst plastic, paper, glass, and ferrous metal should be recycled. After treatment, other waste will go to some form of landfill. Sustainable management of MSW in this city and others with similar conditions should consider particular local conditions and could use the methods and the findings of this study as a starting point.",The Effect of an Innovative Biofeedback SKOL-AS® Treatment on the Body Posture and Trunk Rotation in Children with Idiopathic Scoliosis-Preliminary Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181685,"Medicina (Kaunas, Lithuania)",2019 06 11,"Background andObjectives: The deformity in idiopathic scoliosis (IS) is three dimensional and effective correction involves all three planes. Recently, the biofeedback method has been implemented in the treatment of scoliosis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of an innovative biofeedback SKOL-AS® postural training among children with scoliosis. Materials and Methods: The target population for this study was 28 patients (25 girls and 3 boys) aged between 5 and 16 years old diagnosed and treated with progressing low-grade scoliosis. The postural diagnosis consisted of anthropometric measurements, posterior-anterior X-ray imaging, SpinalMeter® postural assessment and the angle of trunk rotation (ATR) assessment. The SKOL-AS® treatment comprised of 24 sessions conducted in lying and sitting positions, two times a week. Results: It has been shown that the postural training resulted in the decrease in the ATR value (pre- vs. post-exercise in younger: 5.55 vs. 3.0 and older patients: 5.2 vs. 3.0). The increase in height of the subjects seemed to confirm a positive effect of SKOL-AS® elongation treatment. In the posterior view, a statistically significant decrease in shoulder asymmetry in the sitting position in younger children has been observed. In the anterior view, the changes in the head position (based on mouth and eye symmetry) have been observed. The statistically significant increase in acromion-heel, acromion-iliac crest and posterior superior iliac spine (PSIS)-heel length values has been shown in younger children on the left side of the body. After treatment, older subjects had higher acromion-iliac crest and PSIS-heel values on the left side of the body. On the right side only PSIS-heel length was higher. In a sitting position, only a small increase in acromion-iliac crest length value has been observed. Conclusions: The SKOL-AS® biofeedback method could teach good postural habits and teach patients the auto-correction of the spine.","Rapid, Refined, and Robust Method for Expression, Purification, and Characterization of Recombinant Human Amyloid beta 1-42.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181684,Methods and protocols,2019 06 11,"Amyloid plaques found in the brains of Alzheimer's disease patients primarily consists of amyloid beta 1-42 (Aβ42). Commercially, Aβ42 is synthesized using high-throughput peptide synthesizers resulting in the presence of impurities and the racemization of amino acids that affects its aggregation properties. Furthermore, the repeated purchase of even a small quantity (~1 mg) of commercial Aβ42 can be expensive for academic researchers. Here, we describe a detailed methodology for robust expression of recombinant human Aβ(M1-42) in Rosetta(DE3)pLysS and BL21(DE3)pLysS competent E. coli using standard molecular biology techniques with refined and rapid one-step analytical purification techniques. The peptide is isolated and purified from transformed cells using an optimized reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) protocol with commonly available C18 columns, yielding high amounts of peptide (~15-20 mg per 1 L culture) within a short period of time. The recombinant human Aβ(M1-42) forms characteristic aggregates similar to synthetic Aβ42 aggregates as verified by western blotting and atomic force microscopy to warrant future biological use. Our rapid, refined, and robust technique produces pure recombinant human Aβ(M1-42) that may be used to synthesize chemical probes and in several downstream in vitro and in vivo assays to facilitate Alzheimer's disease research.",An Fc-Optimized CD133 Antibody for Induction of Natural Killer Cell Reactivity against Colorectal Cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181683,Cancers,2019 06 11,"The introduction of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) has largely improved treatment options for cancer patients. The ability of antitumor mAbs to elicit antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) contributes to a large extent to their therapeutic efficacy. Many efforts accordingly aim to improve this important function by engineering mAbs with Fc parts that display enhanced affinity to the Fc receptor CD16 expressed, e.g., on natural killer (NK) cells. Here we characterized the CD133 mAb 293C3-SDIE that contains an engineered Fc part modified by the amino acid exchanges S239D/I332E-that reportedly increase the affinity to CD16-with regard to its ability to induce NK reactivity against colorectal cancer (CRC). 293C3-SDIE was found to be a stable protein with favorable binding characteristics achieving saturating binding to CRC cells at concentrations of approximately 1 µg/mL. While not directly affecting CRC cell growth and viability, 293C3-SDIE potently induced NK cell activation, degranulation, secretion of Interferon-γ, as well as ADCC resulting in potent lysis of CRC cell lines. Based on the preclinical characterization presented in this study and the available data indicating that CD133 is broadly expressed in CRC and represents a negative prognostic marker, we conclude that 293C3-SDIE constitutes a promising therapeutic agent for the treatment of CRC and thus warrants clinical evaluation.",Neuroendocrine Aspects of Skin Aging.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181682,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 06 11,"Skin aging is accompanied by a gradual loss of function, physiological integrity and the ability to cope with internal and external stressors. This is secondary to a combination of complex biological processes influenced by constitutive and environmental factors or by local and systemic pathologies. Skin aging and its phenotypic presentation are dependent on constitutive (genetic) and systemic factors. It can be accelerated by environmental stressors, such as ultraviolet radiation, pollutants and microbial insults. The skin's functions and its abilities to cope with external stressors are regulated by the cutaneous neuroendocrine systems encompassing the regulated and coordinated production of neuropeptides, neurohormones, neurotransmitters and hormones, including steroids and secosteroids. These will induce/stimulate downstream signaling through activation of corresponding receptors. These pathways and corresponding coordinated responses to the stressors decay with age or undergo pathological malfunctions. This affects the overall skin phenotype and epidermal, dermal, hypodermal and adnexal functions. We propose that skin aging can be attenuated or its phenotypic presentation reversed by the topical use of selected factors with local neurohormonal activities targeting specific receptors or enzymes. Some of our favorite factors include melatonin and its metabolites, noncalcemic secosteroids and lumisterol derivatives, because of their low toxicity and their desirable local phenotypic effects.",Tobacco and Pituri Use in Pregnancy: A Protocol for Measuring Maternal and Perinatal Exposure and Outcomes in Central Australian Aboriginal Women.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181680,Methods and protocols,2019 06 11,"Maternal tobacco smoking is a recognized risk behavior that has adverse impacts onmaternal and fetal health. However, in some populations, the use of smokeless tobacco exceeds theuse of smoked tobacco. In central Australia, Aboriginal populations utilize wild tobacco plants(Nicotiana spp.) as a smokeless product. These plants are known by a variety of names, one of whichis pituri. The plants are masticated and retained in the oral cavity for extended periods of time andtheir use continues throughout pregnancy, birth, and lactation. In contrast to the evidence related tocombusted tobacco use, there is no evidence as to the effects of pituri use in pregnancy. CentralAustralian Aboriginal women who were at least 28 weeks pregnant were stratified into three tobaccoexposure groups: (a) Pituri chewers, (b) smokers, and (c) non-tobacco users. Routine antenatal andbirth information, pre-existing and pregnancy-related maternal characteristics, fetal characteristics,and biological samples were collected and compared. The biological samples were analysed fortobacco and nicotine metabolite concentrations. Samples from the mother included venous blood,urine, hair and colostrum and/or breast milk. From the neonate, this included Day 1 and Day 3 urineand meconium, and from the placenta, arterial and venous cord blood following delivery. This is thefirst study to correlate the pregnancy outcomes of central Australian Aboriginal women with differenttobacco exposures. The findings will provide the foundation for epidemiological data collection inrelated studies.

Ugni Blanc grape berries were separated into three classes based on the distribution of total soluble solid content (SSC) and total phenolic compounds (TP). Partial least squares regression (PLS) was applied to predict the quality parameters, including color space CIELAB, SSC, and TP. The prediction results showed that the vis/NIR spectrum correlated with the SSC and TP present in the intact grape berries with determination coefficient of prediction (RP2) in the range of 0.735 to 0.823. Next, the vis/NIR spectrum was used to distinguish between berries with different SSC and TP concentrations using partial least squares discrimination analysis (PLS-DA) with >77% accuracy.

The laser was focused on Al-coated silicone rubber by each silica glass microsphere 2.5 μm in diameter, which covered the entire surface of the silicone rubber. The silicone rubber underneath each microsphere photochemically swelled after laser-ablating the coated Al to limit the diameter of the swelling. Simultaneously, the coated Al was able to adjust the focal point to the surface of the silicone rubber to form a hole approximately 500 nm in diameter, centered at the swollen silicone.

Dental implants have been routinely installed after extraction of periodontitis-affected teeth; however, recent studies have indicated that many dental implants are affected by peri-implantitis, which progresses rapidly because of the failure of the immune system. Therefore, there is a renewed focus on periodontal regeneration aroundnatural teeth. To regenerate periodontal tissue, many researchers and clinicians have attempted to perform periodontal regenerative therapy using materials such as bioresorbable scaffolds, growth factors, and cells. The concept of guided tissue regeneration, by which endogenous periodontal ligament- and alveolar bone-derived cells are preferentially proliferated by barrier membranes, has proved effective, and various kinds of membranes are now commercially available. Clinical studies have shown the significance of barrier membranes for periodontal regeneration; however, the technique is indicated only for relatively small infrabony defects. Cytokine therapies have also been introduced to promote periodontal regeneration, but the indications are also for small size defects. To overcome this limitation, ex vivo expanded multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) have been studied. In particular, periodontal ligament-derived multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells are thought to be a responsible cell source, based on both translational and clinical studies. In this review, responsible cell sources for periodontal regeneration and their clinical applications are summarized. In addition, recent transplantation strategies and perspectives about the cytotherapeutic use of stem cells for periodontal regeneration are discussed.",In Silico Analysis of Bioactive Peptides in Invasive Sea Grass Halophila stipulacea.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181665,Cells,2019 06 11,"Halophila stipulacea is a well-known invasive marine sea grass in the Mediterranean Sea. Having been introduced into the Mediterranean Sea via the Suez Channel, it is considered a Lessepsian migrant. Although, unlike other invasive marine seaweeds, it has not demonstrated serious negative impacts on indigenous species, it does have remarkable invasive properties. The present in-silico study reveals the biotechnological features of H. stipulacea by showing bioactive peptides from its rubisc/o protein. These are features such as antioxidant and hypolipideamic activities, dipeptidyl peptidase-IV and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitions. The reported data open up new applications for such bioactive peptides in the field of pharmacy, medicine and also the food industry.",Mediterranean Diet Pyramid: A Proposal for Italian People. A Systematic Review of Prospective Studies to Derive Serving Sizes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181664,Nutrients,2019 06 11,"In the last decade, a number of meta-analyses of mostly observational studies evaluated the relation between the intake of food groups and the risk of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs). In this study, we systematically reviewed dose-response meta-analyses of prospective studies with the aim to derive the quantities of food to consume to attain a protective (Mediterranean food) or a non-adverse (non-Mediterranean food) effect toward selected NCDs such as cardiovascular disease (CVD) including coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke, type 2 diabetes (T2DM), colorectal (CRC) and breast cancer. These derived quantities, wherever possible, were suggested for a quantification of food servings of the Mediterranean Diet Pyramid proposed for Italian People (MDPPI). This pyramid came from the Modern Mediterranean Diet Pyramid developed in 2009 for Italian people. A weekly menu plan was built on the advice about frequency of intakes and serving sizes of such pyramid and the nutritional composition of this diet was compared with the Reference Italian Mediterranean Diet followed in 1960 in Nicotera. The diet built according the advice of MDPPI was very similar to that of Nicotera in the late 1950s that has been chosen as Italian Reference Mediterranean Diet with the exception of percentage of energy provided by cereals that was lower and of fruits and vegetables that was higher. Saturated fatty acids were only the 6% of daily energy intake. Also the Mediterranean Adequacy Index (MAI) was very similar to that of the aforementioned diet.",BarkBase: Epigenomic Annotation of Canine Genomes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181663,Genes,2019 06 11,"Dogs are an unparalleled natural model for investigating the genetics of health and disease, particularly for complex diseases like cancer. Comprehensive genomic annotation of regulatory elements active in healthy canine tissues is crucial both for identifying candidate causal variants and for designing functional studies needed to translate genetic associations into disease insight. Currently, canine geneticists rely primarily on annotations of the human or mouse genome that have been remapped to dog, an approach that misses dog-specific features. Here, we describe BarkBase, a canine epigenomic resource available at barkbase.org. BarkBase hosts data for 27 adult tissue types, with biological replicates, and for one sample of up to five tissues sampled at each of four carefully staged embryonic time points. RNA sequencing is complemented with whole genome sequencing and with assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq), which identifies open chromatin regions. By including replicates, we can more confidently discern tissue-specific transcripts and assess differential gene expression between tissues and timepoints. By offering data in easy-to-use file formats, through a visual browser modeled on similar genomic resources for human, BarkBase introduces a powerful new resource to support comparative studies in dogs and humans.",Nasal Administration and Plasma Pharmacokinetics of Parathyroid Hormone Peptide PTH 1-34 for the Treatment of Osteoporosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181662,Pharmaceutics,2019 06 11,"Nasal delivery of large peptides such as parathyroid 1-34 (PTH 1-34) can benefit from a permeation enhancer to promote absorption across the nasal mucosa into the bloodstream. Previously, we have published an encouraging bioavailability (78%), relative to subcutaneous injection in a small animal preclinical model, for a liquid nasal spray formulation containing the permeation enhancer polyethylene glycol (15)-hydroxystearate (Solutol® HS15). We report here the plasma pharmacokinetics of PTH 1-34 in healthy human volunteers receiving the liquid nasal spray formulation containing Solutol® HS15. For comparison, data for a commercially manufactured teriparatide formulation delivered via subcutaneous injection pen are also presented. Tc-99m-DTPA gamma scintigraphy monitored the deposition of the nasal spray in the nasal cavity and clearance via the inferior meatus and nasopharynx. The 50% clearance time was 17.8 min (minimum 10.9, maximum 74.3 min). For PTH 1-34, mean plasma Cmax of 5 pg/mL and 253 pg/mL were obtained for the nasal spray and subcutaneous injection respectively; relative bioavailability of the nasal spray was ≤1%. Subsequently, we investigated the pharmacokinetics of the liquid nasal spray formulation as well as a dry powder nasal formulation also containing Solutol® HS15 in a crossover study in an established ovine model. In this preclinical model, the relative bioavailability of liquid and powder nasal formulations was 1.4% and 1.0% respectively. The absolute bioavailability of subcutaneously administered PTH 1-34 (mean 77%, range 55-108%) in sheep was in agreement with published human data for teriparatide (up to 95%). These findings have important implications in the search for alternative routes of administration of peptides for the treatment of osteoporosis, and in terms of improving translation from animal models to humans.","Petunidin, a B-ring 5'-O-Methylated Derivative of Delphinidin, Stimulates Osteoblastogenesis and Reduces sRANKL-Induced Bone Loss.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181661,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 06 11,"Several lines of evidence suggest that oxidative stress is one of the key pathogenic mechanisms of osteoporosis. We aimed to elucidate the bone protective effects of petunidin, one of the most common anthocyanidins, considering its potent antioxidative activity. Petunidin (>5 μg/mL) significantly inhibited osteoclastogenesis and downregulated c-fos, Nfatc1, Mmp9, Ctsk, and Dc-stamp mRNA expression in RAW264.7 cells. Conversely, petunidin (>16 μg/mL) stimulated mineralized matrix formation and gene expression of Bmp2 and Ocn, whereas it suppressed Mmp13, Mmp2, and Mmp9 mRNA expression and proteolytic activities of MMP13 and MMP9 in MC3T3-E1 cells. Micro-CT and bone histomorphometry analyses of sRANKL-induced osteopenic C57BL/6J mice showed that daily oral administration of petunidin (7.5 mg/kg/day) increased bone volume to tissue volume (BV/TV), trabecular thickness (Tb.Th), trabecular number (Tb.N), the ratio of osteoid volume to tissue volume (OV/TV), osteoid thickness (O.Th), the ratio of osteoid surface to bone surface (OS/BS), the ratio of osteoblast surface to bone surface (Ob.S/BS), and the number of osteoblast per unit of bone surface (N.Ob/BS), and decreased trabecular separation (Tb.Sp), the ratio of eroded surface to bone surface (ES/BS), the ratio of osteoclast surface to bone surface (Oc.S/BS), and number of osteoclast per unit of bone surface (N.Oc/BS), compared to untreated mice. Furthermore, histological sections of the femurs showed that oral administration of petunidin to sRANKL-induced osteopenic mice increased the size of osteoblasts located along the bone surface and the volume of osteoid was consistent with the in vitro osteoblast differentiation and MMP inhibition. These results suggest that petunidin is a promising natural agent to improve sRANKL-induced osteopenia in mice through increased osteoid formation, reflecting accelerated osteoblastogenesis, concomitant with suppressed bone resorption.",Activation of LXR Receptors and Inhibition of TRAP1 Causes Synthetic Lethality in Solid Tumors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181660,Cancers,2019 06 11,"Cholesterol is a pivotal factor for cancer cells to entertain their relentless growth. In this case, we provide a novel strategy to inhibit tumor growth by simultaneous activation of liver-X-receptors and interference with Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor-associated Protein 1 (TRAP1). Informed by a transcriptomic and subsequent gene set enrichment analysis, we demonstrate that inhibition of TRAP1 results in suppression of the cholesterol synthesis pathway in stem-like and established glioblastoma (GBM) cells by destabilizing the transcription factor SREBP2. Notably, TRAP1 inhibition induced cell death, which was rescued by cholesterol and mevalonate. Activation of liver X receptor (LXR) by a clinically validated LXR agonist, LXR623, along with the TRAP1 inhibitor, gamitrinib (GTPP), results in synergistic reduction of tumor growth and cell death induction in a broad range of solid tumors, which is rescued by exogenous cholesterol. The LXR agonist and TRAP1 inhibitor mediated cell death is regulated at the level of Bcl-2 family proteins with an elevation of pro-apoptotic Noxa. Silencing of Noxa and its effector BAK attenuates cell death mediated by the combination treatment of LXR agonists and TRAP1 inhibition. Combined inhibition of TRAP1 and LXR agonists elicits a synergistic activation of the integrated stress response with an increase in activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) driven by protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK). Silencing of ATF4 attenuates the increase of Noxa by using the combination treatment. Lastly, we demonstrate in patient-derived xenografts that the combination treatment of LXR623 and gamitrinib reduces tumor growth more potent than each compound. Taken together, these results suggest that TRAP1 inhibition and simultaneous activation of LXR might be a potent novel treatment strategy for solid malignancies.",Annotation and Expression of IDN2-like and FDM-like Genes in Sexual and Aposporous Hypericum perforatum L. accessions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181659,"Plants (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 11,"The protein IDN2, together with the highly similar interactors FDM1 and FDM2, is required for RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) and siRNA production. Epigenetic regulation of gene expression is required to restrict cell fate determination in A. thaliana ovules. Recently, three transcripts sharing high similarity with the A. thaliana IDN2 and FDM1-2 were found to be differentially expressed in ovules of apomictic Hypericum perforatum L. accessions. To gain further insight into the expression and regulation of these genes in the context of apomixis, we investigated genomic, transcriptional and functional aspects of the gene family in this species. The H. perforatum genome encodes for two IDN2-like and 7 FDM-like genes. Differential and heterochronic expression of FDM4-like genes was found in H. perforatum pistils. The involvement of these genes in reproduction and seed development is consistent with the observed reduction of the seed set and high variability in seed size in A. thaliana IDN2 and FDM-like knockout lines. Differential expression of IDN2-like and FDM-like genes in H. perforatum was predicted to affect the network of potential interactions between these proteins. Furthermore, pistil transcript levels are modulated by cytokinin and auxin but the effect operated by the two hormones depends on the reproductive phenotype.","High TSH Level within Normal Range Is Associated with Obesity, Dyslipidemia, Hypertension, Inflammation, Hypercoagulability, and the Metabolic Syndrome: A Novel Cardiometabolic Marker.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181658,Journal of clinical medicine,2019 06 11,"(1) Background: Overt and subclinical hypothyroidism has been associated with increased cardiometabolic risks. Here we further explore whether thyroid function within normal range is associated with cardiometabolic risk factors in a large population-based study. (2) Methods: We screened 24,765 adults participating in health examinations in Taiwan. Participants were grouped according to high-sensitive thyroid-stimulating hormone (hsTSH) level as: <50th percentile (0.47-1.48 mIU/L, the reference group), 50-60th percentile (1.49-1.68 mIU/L), 60-70th percentile (1.69-1.94 mIU/L), 70-80th percentile (1.95-2.3 mIU/L), 80-90th percentile (2.31-2.93 mIU/L), and >90th percentile (>2.93 mIU/L). Cardiometabolic traits of each percentile were compared with the reference group. (3) Results: Elevated hsTSH levels within normal range were dose-dependently associated with increased body mass index, body fat percentage, waist circumferences, blood pressure, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), fasting insulin, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), high homeostasis model of assessment of beta-cell (HOMA-β), triglycerides, total cholesterols, fibrinogen, and uric acids (p-for-trend <0.001), but not with fasting glucose levels. The association remained significant after adjustment of age, sex, and lifestyle. As compared to the reference group, subjects with the highest hsTSH percentile had significantly increased risk of being overweight (adjusted odds ratio (adjOR): 1.35), increased body fat (adjOR: 1.29), central obesity (adjOR: 1.36), elevated blood pressure (adjOR: 1.26), high HbA1c (adjOR: 1.20), hyperinsulinemia (adjOR: 1.75), increased HOMA-IR (adjOR: 1.45), increased HOMA-β (adjOR: 1.40), hypertriglyceridemia (adjOR: 1.60), hypercholesterolemia (adjOR: 1.25), elevated hsCRP (adjOR: 1.34), increased fibrinogen (adjOR: 1.45), hyperuricemia (adjOR: 1.47), and metabolic syndrome (adjOR: 1.42), but significant risk of low fasting glucose (adjOR: 0.89). Mediation analysis indicates that insulin resistance mediates the majority of the association between thyroid hormone status and the metabolic syndrome. (4) Conclusion: Elevated hsTSH within the normal range is a cardiometabolic risk marker associated with central obesity, insulin resistance, elevated blood pressure, dyslipidemia, hyperuricemia, inflammation, and hypercoagulability.","Vitamin D Supplementation and Post-Stroke Rehabilitation: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181657,Nutrients,2019 06 11,"Low vitamin D levels are associated with poorer outcomes after stroke. However, it is not clear whether post-stroke vitamin D supplementation can improve these outcomes. In this study, we investigated the effects of vitamin D supplementation on outcomes in hospitalized patients undergoing rehabilitation after acute stroke. A multicenter, randomized, controlled, double-blind, parallel-group trial was conducted from January 2012 through July 2017. One hundred patients admitted to a convalescent rehabilitation ward after having an acute stroke were randomized, and each one received either vitamin D3 (2000 IU/day) or a placebo. The primary outcome was a gain in the Barthel Index scores at week 8. Secondary outcomes were seen in Barthel Index efficiency, hand grip strength, and calf circumference at week 8. Ninety-seven patients completed the study. There were no significant differences in the demographic characteristics between the groups. The mean (±standard deviation) gain in the Barthel Index score was 19.0 ± 14.8 in the supplementation group and 19.5 ± 13.1 in the placebo group (p = 0.88). The Barthel Index efficiency was 0.32 ± 0.31 in the supplementation group and 0.28 ± 0.21 in the placebo group (p = 0.38). There were no between-group differences in the other secondary outcomes. Our findings suggest that oral vitamin D3 supplementation does not improve rehabilitation outcomes after acute stroke."

Clinical studies can provide some data concerning the etiology, pathophysiology, and outcomes of this disease. However, the study of early events and new targeted therapies cannot be performed on humans due to ethical reasons. Experimental murine models can be used in the understanding of the pancreatic inflammation, because they are able to closely mimic the main features of human AP, namely their histologic glandular changes and distant organ failure. These models continue to be important research tools for the reproduction of the etiological, environmental, and genetic factors associated with the pathogenesis of this inflammatory pathology and the exploration of novel therapeutic options. This review provides an overview of several murine models of AP. Furthermore, special focus is made on the most frequently carried out models, the protocols used, and their advantages and limitations. Finally, examples are provided of the use of these models to improve knowledge of the mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis, identify new biomarkers of severity, and develop new targeted therapies.","Comparison of Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus Isolates from Cellulitis and from Osteomyelitis in a Taiwan Hospital, 2016-2018.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181643,Journal of clinical medicine,2019 06 11,"Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) causes superficial infections such as cellulitis or invasive infections such as osteomyelitis; however, differences in MRSA isolates from cellulitis (CL-MRSA) and from osteomyelitis (OM-MRSA) at the same local area remain largely unknown. A total of 221 MRSA isolates including 106 CL-MRSA strains and 115 OM-MRSA strains were collected at Chang-Gung Memorial Hospital in Taiwan between 2016 and 2018, and their genotypic and phenotypic characteristics were compared. We found that OM-MRSA isolates significantly exhibited higher rates of resistance to multiple antibiotics than CL-MRSA isolates. Genotypically, OM-MRSA isolates had higher proportions of the SCCmec type III, the sequence type ST239, and the spa type t037 than CL-MRSA isolates. Besides the multidrug-resistant lineage ST239-t037-SCCmecIII more prevalent in OM-MRSA, higher antibiotic resistance rates were also observed in several other prevalent lineages in OM-MRSA as compared to the same lineages in CL-MRSA. Furthermore, when prosthetic joint infection (PJI) associated and non-PJI-associated MRSA strains in osteomyelitis were compared, no significant differences were observed in antibiotic resistance rates between the two groups, albeit more diverse genotypes were found in non-PJI-associated MRSA. Our findings therefore suggest that deep infections may allow MRSA to evade antibiotic attack and facilitate the convergent evolution and selection of multidrug-resistant lineages.","Toxicity of Kadsura coccinea (Lem.)

Smith is an evergreen, woody climbing plant that is widely distributed throughout southwest mainland China. Extracts of this plant are used in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) for the treatment of various diseases, like cancer and dermatosis, and as an anodyne to relieve pain, while the leaves are used to treat eczema. In the current study, the toxicity of essential oil from its stem (EOKC) was studied against two strains of bed bugs (Cimex lectularius). Essential oil from the plant was obtained by hydrodistillation and analyzed by GC/MS. The major compound identified was β-caryophyllene (24.73%), followed by caryophyllene oxide (5.91%), α-humulene (3.48%), and β-pinene (2.54%). Preliminary screening was performed by topically delivering a 1 µL droplet of the treatments dissolved in acetone. At 24 h after treatment, the EOKC induced mortality rates of 61.9% and 66.7% in the Bayonne and Ft. Dix strains, respectively, at 100 µg/bug. Four major compounds-β-caryophyllene, caryophyllene oxide, α-humulene, and β-pinene-were selected based on their availability and were subjected to topical, residual, and fumigation methods. When applied topically, only β-caryophyllene induced high toxicity in both strains. None of the selected compounds induced significant toxicity in the residual and fumigation methods.","Bile Acid and Fibroblast Growth Factor 19 Regulation in Obese Diabetics, and Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease after Sleeve Gastrectomy.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181641,Journal of clinical medicine,2019 06 11,"Sleeve gastrectomy (SG) is an effective treatment for obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD); however, the mechanism is not completely understood.

The aim of this study was to compare the potential prebiotic effects of fructans with increasing degrees of polymerization, namely fructooligosaccharides (FOS) and inulins with a low and high polymerization degree (LPDI and HPDI, respectively), using an ex vivo fermentation system to simulate the colonic environment. The system was inoculated with pooled feces from three healthy donors with the same baseline enterotype. Changes in microbiota composition were measured by 16S metagenomic sequencing after 2, 7, and 14 days of fermentation, and acid production was measured throughout the experiment. Alpha-diversity decreased upon inoculation of the ex vivo fermentation under all treatments. Composition changed significantly across both treatments and time (ANOSIM p < 0.005 for both factors). HPDI and LPDI seemed to be similar to each other regarding composition and acidification activity, but different from the control and FOS. FOS differed from the control in terms of composition but not acidification. HDPI restored alpha-diversity on day 14 as compared to the control (Bonferroni p < 0.05). In conclusion, the prebiotic activity of fructans appears to depend on the degree of polymerization, with LPDI and especially HPDI having a greater effect than FOS.",Scalable Synthesis of Mesoporous TiO2 for Environmental Photocatalytic Applications.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181637,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 11,"Increasing environmental concern, related to pollution and clean energy demand, have urged the development of new smart solutions profiting from nanotechnology, including the renowned nanomaterial-assisted photocatalytic degradation of pollutants.

In plants, this is exemplified by the PIN-FORMED (PIN) efflux carriers of the phytohormone auxin: The polar subcellular localization of the PINs is instructive to the directional intercellular auxin transport, and thus to a plethora of auxin-regulated growth and developmental processes. Despite its importance, the regulation of PIN polar subcellular localization remains poorly understood. Here, we have employed advanced live-cell imaging techniques to study the roles of microtubules and actin microfilaments in the establishment of apical polar localization of PIN2 in the epidermis of the Arabidopsis root meristem. We report that apical PIN2 polarity requires neither intact actin microfilaments nor microtubules, suggesting that the primary spatial cue for polar PIN distribution is likely independent of cytoskeleton-guided endomembrane trafficking.","Bone Immune Response to Materials, Part II: Copper and Polyetheretherketone (PEEK) Compared to Titanium at 10 and 28 Days in Rabbit Tibia.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181635,Journal of clinical medicine,2019 06 11,"Osseointegration is likely the result of an immunologically driven bone reaction to materials such as titanium. Osseointegration has resulted in the clinical possibility to anchor oral implants in jaw bone tissue. However, the mechanisms behind bony anchorage are not fully understood and complications over a longer period of time have been reported. The current study aims at exploring possible differences between copper (Cu) and polyetheretherketone (PEEK) materials that do not osseointegrate, with osseointegrating cp titanium as control. The implants were placed in rabbit tibia and selected immune markers were evaluated at 10 and 28 days of follow-up. Cu and PEEK demonstrated at both time points a higher immune activation than cp titanium. Cu demonstrated distance osteogenesis due to a maintained proinflammatory environment over time, and PEEK failed to osseointegrate due to an immunologically defined preferential adipose tissue formation on its surface. The here presented results suggest the description of two different mechanisms for failed osseointegration, both of which are correlated to the immune system."

However, the underlying mechanisms of malignancy in RCC are not completely understood. We found that silencing of fibronectin expression attenuated human RCC 786-O and Caki-1 cell growth and migration. Silencing of potential fibronectin receptor integrin α5 and integrin β1 decreased 786-O cell ability in movement and chemotactic migration. Biochemical examination revealed a reduction of cyclin D1 and vimentin expression, transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) production, as well as Src and Smad phosphorylation in fibronectin-silenced 786-O and Caki-1 cells. Pharmacological inhibition of Src decreased 786-O cell growth and migration accompanied by a reduction of cyclin D1, fibronectin, vimentin, and TGF-β1 expression, as well as Src and Smad phosphorylation. In 786-O cells, higher activities in cell growth and migration than in Caki-1 cells were noted, along with elevated fibronectin and TGF-β1 expression. The additions of exogenous fibronectin and TGF-β1 promoted Caki-1 cell growth and migration, and increased cyclin D1, fibronectin, vimentin, and TGF-β1 expression, as well as Src and Smad phosphorylation. These findings highlight the role of fibronectin in RCC cell growth and migration involving Src and TGF-β1 signaling.",Benzimidazoles Downregulate Mdm2 and MdmX and Activate p53 in MdmX Overexpressing Tumor Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181622,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 11,"Tumor suppressor p53 is mutated in about 50% of cancers. Most malignant melanomas carry wild-type p53, but p53 activity is often inhibited due to overexpression of its negative regulators Mdm2 or MdmX. We performed high throughput screening of 2448 compounds on A375 cells carrying p53 activity luciferase reporter construct to reveal compounds that promote p53 activity in melanoma. Albendazole and fenbendazole, two approved and commonly used benzimidazole anthelmintics, stimulated p53 activity and were selected for further studies. The protein levels of p53 and p21 increased upon the treatment with albendazole and fenbendazole, indicating activation of the p53-p21 pathway, while the levels of Mdm2 and MdmX decreased in melanoma and breast cancer cells overexpressing these proteins. We also observed a reduction of cell viability and changes of cellular morphology corresponding to mitotic catastrophe, i.e., G2/M cell cycle arrest of large multinucleated cells with disrupted microtubules. In summary, we established a new tool for testing the impact of small molecule compounds on the activity of p53 and used it to identify the action of benzimidazoles in melanoma cells. The drugs promoted the stability and transcriptional activity of wild-type p53 via downregulation of its negative regulators Mdm2 and MdmX in cells overexpressing these proteins. The results indicate the potential for repurposing the benzimidazole anthelmintics for the treatment of cancers overexpressing p53 negative regulators.","Boosting GSH Using the Co-Drug Approach: I-152, a Conjugate of N-acetyl-cysteine and β-mercaptoethylamine.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181621,Nutrients,2019 06 11,"Glutathione (GSH) has poor pharmacokinetic properties; thus, several derivatives and biosynthetic precursors have been proposed as GSH-boosting drugs. I-152 is a conjugate of N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) and S-acetyl-β-mercaptoethylamine (SMEA) designed to release the parent drugs (i.e., NAC and β-mercaptoethylamine or cysteamine, MEA). NAC is a precursor of L-cysteine, while MEA is an aminothiol able to increase GSH content; thus, I-152 represents the very first attempt to combine two pro-GSH molecules. In this review, the in-vitro and in-vivo metabolism, pro-GSH activity and antiviral and immunomodulatory properties of I-152 are discussed. Under physiological GSH conditions, low I-152 doses increase cellular GSH content; by contrast, high doses cause GSH depletion but yield a high content of NAC, MEA and I-152, which can be used to resynthesize GSH. Preliminary in-vivo studies suggest that the molecule reaches mouse organs, including the brain, where its metabolites, NAC and MEA, are detected. In cell cultures, I-152 replenishes experimentally depleted GSH levels. Moreover, administration of I-152 to C57BL/6 mice infected with the retroviral complex LP-BM5 is effective in contrasting virus-induced GSH depletion, exerting at the same time antiviral and immunomodulatory functions. I-152 acts as a pro-GSH agent; however, GSH derivatives and NAC cannot completely replicate its effects. The co-delivery of different thiol species may lead to unpredictable outcomes, which warrant further investigation.",Collagen 1A1 (COL1A1) Is a Reliable Biomarker and Putative Therapeutic Target for Hepatocellular Carcinogenesis and Metastasis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181620,Cancers,2019 06 11,"Increasing evidence shows that hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a principal cause of cancer-related mortality globally, especially among Asian and African populations. Collagen type I α1 (COL1A1) is the major component of type I collagen. While aberrant expression of COL1A1 and COL1A2 is implicated in numerous cancers, the differential role of COL1A1 in malignant, premalignant and normal tissues remains unclear, and its clinical significance in HCC has not been elucidated. In this study, using bioinformatics analysis of publicly-available HCC microarray data from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and RNAseq data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, we determined that COL1A1 is significantly upregulated in HCC tumor tissues in comparison to normal tissues. Our analysis also revealed that COL1A1 confers survival advantage and enhanced oncogenicity on HCC cells. Interestingly, the siRNA-mediated silencing of COL1A1 expression (siCOLIA1) suppressed HCC cells clonogenicity, motility, invasiveness and tumorsphere formation. Concomitantly, siCOL1A1 abrogated Slug-dependent epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and HCC stemness gene-signature, by attenuating expression of stemness markers SOX2, OCT4 and CD133. The present study provides some mechanistic insight into COL1A1 activity in HCC and highlights its putative role as an important diagnostic biomarker and potential therapeutic target in early development and metastasis of HCC.",Knockdown of microRNA-135b in Mammary Carcinoma by Targeted Nanodiamonds: Potentials and Pitfalls of In Vivo Applications.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181619,"Nanomaterials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 11,"Nanodiamonds (ND) serve as RNA carriers with potential for in vivo application. ND coatings and their administration strategy significantly change their fate, toxicity, and effectivity within a multicellular system. Our goal was to develop multiple ND coating for effective RNA delivery in vivo. Our final complex (NDA135b) consisted of ND, polymer, antisense RNA, and transferrin. We aimed (i) to assess if a tumor-specific coating promotes NDA135b tumor accumulation and effective inhibition of oncogenic microRNA-135b and (ii) to outline off-targets and immune cell interactions. First, we tested NDA135b toxicity and effectivity in tumorospheres co-cultured with immune cells ex vivo. We found NDA135b to target tumor cells, but it binds also to granulocytes. Then, we followed with NDA135b intravenous and intratumoral applications in tumor-bearing animals in vivo. Application of NDA135b in vivo led to the effective knockdown of microRNA-135b in tumor tissue regardless administration. Only intravenous application resulted in NDA135b circulation in peripheral blood and urine and the decreased granularity of splenocytes. Our data show that localized intratumoral application of NDA135b represents a suitable and safe approach for in vivo application of nanodiamond-based constructs. Systemic intravenous application led to an interaction of NDA135b with bio-interface, and needs further examination regarding its safety.",An Effective Primary Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma In Vitro Model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181618,Cells,2019 06 11,"Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma is a highly malignant disease and research is needed to find new therapeutic approaches. Faithful experimental models are required for this purpose. Here, we describe the specific cell culture conditions enabling the efficient establishment of primary cell culture models. Whereas a classical 10% serum-containing medium resulted in the growth of fibroblast-like cells that outcompeted epithelial cells, we found that the use of specific culture conditions enabled the growth of epithelial tumor cells from HPV+ and HPV- head and neck cancer tissue applicable for research. EpCAM and high Thy-1 positivity on the cell surface were mutually exclusive and distinguished epithelial and fibroblast-like subpopulations in all primary cultures examined and thus can be used to monitor stromal contamination and epithelial cell content. Interestingly, cells of an individual patient developed tumor spheroids in suspension without the use of ultra-low attachment plates, whereas all other samples exclusively formed adherent cell layers. Spheroid cells were highly positive for ALDH1A1 and hence displayed a phenotype reminiscent of tumor stem cells. Altogether, we present a system to establish valuable primary cell culture models from head and neck cancer tissue at high efficiency that might be applicable in other tumor entities as well.","Interactions between β-Lactoglobulin and 3,3'-Diindolylmethane in Model System.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181617,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 11,"The compound 3,3'-diindolylmethane (DIM) has a broad spectrum of anticancer activities. However, low stability and bioavailability limit its application. Elucidating interactions between DIM and β-lactoglobulin (β-LG) may be useful for fabricating whey protein-based protecting systems. Interaction with DIM increased the diameter and absolute zeta potential value of β-LG. UV-absorption spectra suggested that there was a complex of DIM and β-LG. β-LG showed enhanced fluorescence intensity by complexing with DIM with a binding constant of 6.7 × 105 M-1. Upon interaction with DIM, β-LG was decreased in secondary structure content of helix and turn while increased in β-sheet and unordered. FT-IR spectra and molecular docking results indicated the roles of hydrophobic interaction and hydrogen bond for the formation of DIM and β-LG nanocomplexes. Data suggested that β-LG may be a good vehicle for making a protein-based DIM protection and delivery system due to the tight binding of DIM to β-LG.",Nutrition and Supplement Update for the Endurance Athlete: Review and Recommendations.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181616,Nutrients,2019 06 11,Endurance events have experienced a significant increase in growth in the new millennium and are popular activities for participation globally.

In the present study, scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive spectroscopy, a high-temperature testing machine, a Brinell hardness tester and the Image-Pro Plus software were used to analyze and compare the types and amounts of inclusions, the average area of the (Al,Mg)O inclusions, and the mechanical properties of points at different distances from the edge of the GH4169 superalloy vacuum arc remelting (VAR) ingot edge. The effects of the amount of turning to which the superalloy is subjected, the metallurgical qualities, and the mechanical properties were systematically studied. The results showed that the five inclusion types did not change as the sampling locations moved away from the ingot edge, but the amount of inclusions and the average area of the (Al,Mg)O inclusions first decreased and then stabilized. Similarly, the tensile strength, elongation, section shrinkage, hardness, and fatigue life first increased and then stabilized. Finally, this experiment tentatively determined that an appropriate amount of turning for a GH4169 superalloy ingot is 36-48 mm.",Multi-View Image Denoising Using Convolutional Neural Network.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181614,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 13,"In this paper, we propose a novel multi-view image denoising algorithm based on convolutional neural network (MVCNN). Multi-view images are arranged into 3D focus image stacks (3DFIS) according to different disparities. The MVCNN is trained to process each 3DFIS and generate a denoised image stack that contains the recovered image information for regions of particular disparities. The denoised image stacks are then fused together to produce a denoised target view image using the estimated disparity map. Different from conventional multi-view denoising approaches that group similar patches first and then perform denoising on those patches, our CNN-based algorithm saves the effort of exhaustive patch searching and greatly reduces the computational time. In the proposed MVCNN, residual learning and batch normalization strategies are also used to enhance the denoising performance and accelerate the training process. Compared with the state-of-the-art single image and multi-view denoising algorithms, experiments show that the proposed CNN-based algorithm is a highly effective and efficient method in Gaussian denoising of multi-view images."

In spite of its great applicability, a small amount of polymer that is yielded in a short-time polymerization has been a major bottleneck for polymer characterizations. In order to overcome this limitation, a large-scale SF (LSF) system has been developed, which offers stable and scalable polymerization over an expanded time range from a few tens milliseconds to several seconds. The scalability of the LSF technique has been further improved by introducing a new quenching protocol. With these advantages, the LSF technique has been effectively applied to address several unknown issues in ZN catalysis, such as the role of physical and chemical transformations of a catalyst on the initial polymerization kinetics, and regiochemistry of ZN propylene polymerization. Here, we review the development of the LSF technique and recent efforts for understanding heterogeneous ZN olefin polymerization catalysis with this new system.",Catalytic Activity of Oxidized Carbon Waste Ashes for the Crosslinking of Epoxy Resins.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181600,Polymers,2019 06 11,"In this study, two different fillers were prepared from carbon-based ashes, produced from the wooden biomass of a pyro-gasification plant, and starting from lignocellulosic waste. The first type was obtained by dry ball-milling (DBA), while the second one was prepared by oxidation in H2O2 of the dry ball-milled ashes (oDBA). The characterization of the fillers included wide-angle x-ray diffraction (WAXD), thermogravimetric, and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis. The DBA and oDBA fillers were then tested as possible catalysts for the crosslinking reaction of a diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A (DGEBA) with a diamine. The cure reaction was studied by means of rheometry and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The oDBA filler exhibits both a higher catalytic activity on the epoxide-amine reaction than the DBA sample and improved mechanical properties and glass transition temperature. The results obtained indicate, hence, the potential improvement brought by the addition of carbon-based waste ashes, which allow both increasing the flexural properties and the glass transition temperature of the epoxy resin and reducing the curing time, acting as a catalyst for the crosslinking reaction of the epoxy resin.",The Ecology of New Constituents of the Tick Virome and Their Relevance to Public Health.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181599,Viruses,2019 06 11,"Ticks are vectors of several pathogens that can be transmitted to humans and their geographic ranges are expanding. The exposure of ticks to new hosts in a rapidly changing environment is likely to further increase the prevalence and diversity of tick-borne diseases. Although ticks are known to transmit bacteria and viruses, most studies of tick-borne disease have focused upon Lyme disease, which is caused by infection with Borrelia burgdorferi. Until recently, ticks were considered as the vectors of a few viruses that can infect humans and animals, such as Powassan, Tick-Borne Encephalitis and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever viruses. Interestingly, however, several new studies undertaken to reveal the etiology of unknown human febrile illnesses, or to describe the virome of ticks collected in different countries, have uncovered a plethora of novel viruses in ticks. Here, we compared the virome compositions of ticks from different countries and our analysis indicates that the global tick virome is dominated by RNA viruses. Comparative phylogenetic analyses of tick viruses from these different countries reveals distinct geographical clustering of the new tick viruses. Some of these new tick RNA viruses (notably severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus and Heartland virus) were found to be associated with serious human diseases. Their relevance to public health remains unknown. It is plausible that most of these newly identified tick viruses are of endogenous origin or are restricted in their transmission potential, but the efforts to identify new tick viruses should continue. Indeed, future research aimed at defining the origin, the ecology and the spillover potential of this novel viral biodiversity will be critical to understand the relevance to public health.",Effects of Disruption of Five FUM Genes on Fumonisin Biosynthesis and Pathogenicity in Fusarium proliferatum.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181598,Toxins,2019 06 11,"The mycotoxin fumonisin is known to be harmful to humans and animals, and thus it is desirable to reduce fumonisin content in crop products. We explored the functions of several genes that function in fumonisin biosynthesis (FUM1, FUM6, FUM8, FUM19, and FUM21) in Fusarium proliferatum and found that deletion of FUM1, FUM6, FUM8, or FUM21 results in a severe reduction in fumonisin biosynthesis, while loss of FUM19 does not. In addition, fumonisin-deficient strains display significantly decreased pathogenicity. Co-cultivation of the ΔFUM1, ΔFUM6, ΔFUM8, and ΔFUM19 mutants restores fumonisin synthesis. However, co-cultivation was unable to restore fumonisin synthesis in the ΔFUM21 strain. The relative expression levels of three key FUM genes (FUM1, FUM6, and FUM8) differed significantly in each mutant strain; notably, the expression levels of these three genes were significantly down-regulated in the ΔFUM21 strain. Taken together, our results demonstrate that FUM1, FUM6, FUM8, and FUM21 are essential for fumonisin synthesis, and FUM19 is non-essential. Partial mutants lost the ability to synthesize fumonisin, the co-culture of the mutants was able to restore fumonisin biosynthesis. While the pathogenicity of F. proliferatum is affected by many factors, inhibition of the synthesis of the mycotoxin fumonisin will weaken the pathogenicity of rice spikelet rot disease (RSRD).",Relationship between Degree of Polymeric Ionisation and Hydrolytic Degradation of Eudragit® E Polymers under Extreme Acid Conditions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181597,Polymers,2019 06 11,"The commercial copolymers Eudragit® E 100 and Eudragit® PO are widely used materials in the pharmaceutical field as coating systems. Such materials derived from amino-methacrylate groups under acidulated conditions may acquire an ionisable fraction or undergo hydrolytic degradation of the polymeric structure. This work focused on establishing the chemical, physical, and surface changes of two reprocessed polymeric materials, here named as EuCl-E-100 and EuCl-E-PO, which were obtained from the commercial Eudragit® E 100 and Eudragit® E PO, respectively. The commercial materials were exposed to extreme acid conditions, where the polymers were solubilised and subsequently dried by the refractance window method. The materials obtained were chemically characterised by potentiometric titration, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H NMR and 13C NMR) in one and two dimensions (COSY, HSQC, and HMBC), infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and differential scanning calorimetry. Changes in the physical properties of the materials were evaluated through studies of flowability, compactability, and their ability to gain and lose humidity. Surface thermodynamic studies were carried out through contact angle measurements using the sessile drop method. The results showed that the processed polymeric materials acquired a substantial degree of ionisation without undergoing hydrolysis of the esterified groups. Furthermore, such changes improved the flow characteristics of the material and the solubility in aqueous media at pH > 5, while also maintaining the hydrophobicity degree of the polymeric surface.",Clinical Characteristics and Treatment Outcomes of Definitive Versus Standard Anti-Tuberculosis Therapy in Patients with Tuberculous Lymphadenitis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181596,Journal of clinical medicine,2019 06 11,"Although it is necessary to culture Mycobacterium tuberculosis from tuberculous lymphadenitis (TBL) patients for definitive therapy, based on the drug-sensitivity test (DST), substantial cases remain culture-negative. Limited data are available regarding the treatment outcomes after standard anti-tuberculosis therapy in culture-negative TBL. The aim of this study was to compare the recurrence rates between definitive anti-tuberculosis therapy, based on DST and standard anti-tuberculosis therapy in culture-negative TBL. A multicenter retrospective cohort study was performed from 2011 to 2015 in South Korea. The study population was divided into two groups according to treatment type. A total of 234 patients with TBL were analyzed, who were treated with definitive (84 patients) and standard anti-tuberculosis (150 patients) therapy, respectively. During a 28.0 (24.0-43.0) month follow-up period, nine cases (3.8%) had recurrence of TB after treatment completion. The recurrence rate was not significantly different between the two groups (2/84, 2.4% in definitive anti-tuberculosis therapy group versus 7/150, 4.7% in standard anti-tuberculosis therapy group, p = 0.526). The recurrence in all nine cases was diagnosed as clinical recurrence rather than microbiological recurrence. Therefore, culture-negative TBL can be treated with standard anti-TB medication, although DST is not available but clinically stable after initiation of treatment.",Second-Order Vector Mode Propagation in Hollow-Core Antiresonant Fibers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181595,Micromachines,2019 06 11,"Second-order vector modes, possessing doughnut-shaped intensity distribution with unique polarization, are widely utilized in material micromachining, optical tweezers, and high-resolution microscopy. Since the hollow-core fiber can act as a flexible and robust optical waveguide for ultra-short pulse delivery and manipulation, high-order vector modes guided in hollow-core fibers will have huge potential in many advanced applications. We firstly reveal that a second-order vector mode can be well guided in a hollow-core antiresonant fiber with the suppression of the fundamental mode and other second-order vector modes at the red side of transmission band. We interpret our observation through a phase-matched coupling mechanism between core modes and coupled cladding modes. A single second-order vector mode such as TE01, TM01, or HE21 can be guided with low confinement loss at specific wavelengths with appropriate structure parameters. Our proposed hollow-core fibers have a modal engineering function which will open up a new avenue toward the single second-order vector mode propagation and its fiberized applications.","Development and Optimization of Expression, Purification, and ATPase Assay of KaiC for Medium-Throughput Screening of Circadian Clock Mutants in Cyanobacteria.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181593,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 06 11,"The slow but temperature-insensitive adenosine triphosphate (ATP) hydrolysis reaction in KaiC is considered as one of the factors determining the temperature-compensated period length of the cyanobacterial circadian clock system. Structural units responsible for this low but temperature-compensated ATPase have remained unclear. Although whole-KaiC scanning mutagenesis can be a promising experimental strategy, producing KaiC mutants and assaying those ATPase activities consume considerable time and effort. To overcome these bottlenecks for in vitro screening, we optimized protocols for expressing and purifying the KaiC mutants and then designed a high-performance liquid chromatography system equipped with a multi-channel high-precision temperature controller to assay the ATPase activity of multiple KaiC mutants simultaneously at different temperatures. Through the present protocol, the time required for one KaiC mutant is reduced by approximately 80% (six-fold throughput) relative to the conventional protocol with reasonable reproducibility. For validation purposes, we picked up three representatives from 86 alanine-scanning KaiC mutants preliminarily investigated thus far and characterized those clock functions in detail.",Role of Platelet Glycoprotein VI and Tyrosine Kinase Syk in Thrombus Formation on Collagen-Like Surfaces.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181592,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 06 11,"Platelet interaction with collagens, via von Willebrand factor, is a potent trigger of shear-dependent thrombus formation mediated by subsequent engagement of the signaling collagen receptor glycoprotein (GP)VI, enforced by integrin α2β1.

High-shear perfusion of blood over microspots of these substances resulted in thrombus formation, which was assessed by eight parameters and was indicative of platelet adhesion, activation, aggregation, and contraction, which were affected by the Syk inhibitor PRT-060318. In platelet suspensions, only collagen peptides containing the consensus GPVI-activating sequence (GPO)n and Horm-type collagen evoked Syk-dependent Ca2+ rises. In whole blood under flow, Syk inhibition suppressed platelet activation and aggregation parameters for the collagen peptides with or without a (GPO)n sequence and for all of the collagens. Prediction models based on a regression analysis indicated a mixed role of GPVI in thrombus formation on fibrillar collagens, which was abolished by Syk inhibition. Together, these findings indicate that GPVI-dependent signaling through Syk supports platelet activation in thrombus formation on collagen-like structures regardless of the presence of a (GPO)n sequence.",Isolation and Characterization T4- and T7-Like Phages that Infect the Bacterial Plant Pathogen Agrobacterium tumefaciens.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181591,Viruses,2019 06 11,"In the rhizosphere, bacteria-phage interactions are likely to have important impacts on the ecology of microbial communities and microbe-plant interactions. To better understand the dynamics of Agrobacteria-phage interactions, we have isolated diverse bacteriophages which infect the bacterial plant pathogen, Agrobacterium tumefaciens. Here, we complete the genomic characterization of Agrobacteriumtumefaciens phages Atu_ph04 and Atu_ph08. Atu_ph04-a T4-like phage belonging to the Myoviridae family-was isolated from waste water and has a 143,349 bp genome that encodes 223 predicted open reading frames (ORFs). Based on phylogenetic analysis and whole-genome alignments, Atu_ph04 is a member of a newly described T4 superfamily that contains other Rhizobiales-infecting phages. Atu_ph08, a member of the Podoviridae T7-like family, was isolated from waste water, has a 59,034 bp genome, and encodes 75 ORFs. Based on phylogenetic analysis and whole-genome alignments, Atu_ph08 may form a new T7 superfamily which includes Sinorhizobium phage PCB5 and Ochrobactrum phage POI1126. Atu_ph08 is predicted to have lysogenic activity, as we found evidence of an integrase and several transcriptional repressors with similarity to proteins in transducing phage P22. Together, this data suggests that Agrobacterium phages are diverse in morphology, genomic content, and lifestyle."

The process has yet to be recapitulated in vitro whereas in vivo it is directly driven by uterine secretions and indirectly influenced by systemic progesterone. To better understand the environment facilitating this critical reproductive phenomenon, we interrogated the biochemical composition of uterine luminal fluid from heifers with high vs. physiological circulating progesterone on Days 12-14 of the estrous cycle-the window of conceptus elongation-initiation-by high-throughput untargeted ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectroscopy. A total of 233 biochemicals were identified, clustering within 8 super-pathways [amino acids (33.9%), lipids (32.2%), carbohydrates (8.6%), nucleotides (8.2%), xenobiotics (6.4%), cofactors and vitamins (5.2%), energy substrates (4.7%), and peptides (0.9%)] and spanning 66 metabolic sub-pathways. Lipids dominated total progesterone (39.1%) and day (57.1%) effects; however, amino acids (48.5%) and nucleotides (14.8%) accounted for most day by progesterone interactions. Corresponding pathways over-represented in response to day and progesterone include (i) methionine, cysteine, s-adenosylmethionine, and taurine (9.3%), (ii) phospholipid (7.4%), and (iii) (hypo)xanthine and inosine purine metabolism (5.6%). Moreover, under physiological conditions, the uterine lumen undergoes a metabolic shift after Day 12, and progesterone supplementation increases total uterine luminal biochemical abundance at a linear rate of 0.41-fold·day-1-resulting in a difference (P ≤ 0.0001) by Day 14.

While several previous studies have evaluated off-target mutations in genomic DNA4-8, it is now appreciated that the deaminases integral to commonly used DNA base editors often exhibit RNA binding activity9-13. For example, the cytosine deaminase APOBEC1 used in cytosine base editors (CBEs) was found to target both DNA and RNA12, and the adenine deaminase TadA used in adenine base editors (ABEs) was found to induce site-specific inosine formation on RNA9,11. However, any potential RNA mutations caused by DNA base editors has not been evaluated. Adeno-associated viruses are the most common delivery system for DNA editing gene therapies; these viruses can sustain long-term gene expression in vivo, so the extent of potential RNA mutation induced by DNA base editors is of great concern14-16[REMOVED HYPERLINK FIELD]. Here, we quantitatively evaluated the RNA single nucleotide variations (SNVs) induced by CBEs and by ABEs. We found that both the cytosine base editor BE3 and the adenine base editor ABE7.10 generate tens of thousands of off-target RNA SNVs. Subsequently, by engineering deaminases, we found that three CBE variants and one ABE variant reduced off-target RNA SNVs to the baseline while maintaining their efficient DNA on-target activity.

Animal model data suggest that N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists may block corticosteroid effect on the hippocampus. This translational clinical trial investigated the effect of memantine vs. placebo on hippocampal subfield volume in humans receiving chronic corticosteroid therapy. Men and women (N = 46) receiving chronic prescription corticosteroid therapy were randomized to memantine or placebo in a double-blind, crossover design (two 24-week treatment periods, separated by a 4-week washout) for 52 weeks. Structural magnetic resonance imaging was obtained at baseline and after each treatment. Data were analyzed using repeated measures analysis of variance. Mean corticosteroid dose was 7.69 ± 6.41 mg/day and mean duration 4.90 ± 5.61 years. Controlling for baseline volumes, the left DG/CA3 region was significantly larger following memantine than placebo (p = .011). The findings suggest that an NMDA receptor antagonist attenuates corticosteroid effect in the same hippocampal subfields in humans as in animal models. This finding has both mechanistic and clinical implications. Attenuation of the effect of corticosteroids on the human DG/CA3 region implicates the NMDA receptor in human hippocampal volume losses with corticosteroids. In addition, by suggesting a drug class that may, at least in part, block the effects of corticosteroids on the human DG/CA3 subfield, these results may have clinical relevance for people receiving prescription corticosteroids, as well as to those with cortisol elevations due to medical or psychiatric conditions.",Tuning spin filtering by anchoring groups in benzene derivative molecular junctions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181563,Journal of physics.

The changes in dispersion laws of SWCNT low-frequency phonon modes due to the axial stress of different signs are discussed. Then, the results obtained are used to analyze low-temperature (T&amp;lt;70 K) heat capacity and thermal conductivity of individual nanotubes. We demonstrate that compressive stress leads to increase in heat capacity CV of an individual SWCNT, while tensile stress causes CV to decrease. In the latter case at T→0 heat capacity diminishes according to a linear law ~T instead of a power one ~T1/2.

To evaluate the effectiveness of the decontamination measures in reducing individual doses and examine the influence of the timing of decontamination and the district, the data for 18,392 adults and 3,650 children in Minamisoma City, Fukushima, who participated in voluntary screening programs using individual radiation dosimeters (Glass Badge) between June 2013 and September 2016 were analyzed. The dose reduction rates (DRR) in 2013, 2014, and 2015 for one year were calculated and compared between in areas with and without decontamination. Using a regression approach and Monte-Carlo simulation, the dose reduction rate by decontamination (DRRd') was also estimated. The annual DRR in areas with decontamination for both adults and children were significantly higher than those in areas without decontamination, depending on the timing of decontamination: 31-36% for 2013-2014 for adults in decontamination areas and 33-35% for children in decontamination areas compared to 12-23% and 13-23% for adults and children in areas without decontamination, respectively. There was a positive correlation between the DRRd' and individual doses, and the DRRd' was estimated 30-40% for adults and children with doses of 3 mSv/y in 2013 and 2014.

Here, we present a novel electrochemically-triggered transience mechanism of Si by lithiation, allowing complete and controllable destruction of Si devices. The depth and microstructure of lithiation-affected zone over time is investigated in detail and the results suggest a few hours of lithiation is sufficient to create microcracks and significantly promote Li penetration.

A 1% increase in kg of oil equivalent per capita energy consumed and real income per capita led to 0.542% decrease and 0.558% increase in environmental quality in the long-run. On the direction of predictive relationship, empirical results showed unidirectional causality running from environmental quality to real income per capita, from kg oil equivalent per capita of energy consumed to environmental quality and from kg oil equivalent per capita of energy consumed to real income per capita. Results indicated that environmental pollution in South Africa is not output driven but depends on the unit of kg oil equivalent per capita energy produced and consumed. Depending on the direction of causality between the variables, the policy implication can be examined from the perspective of economic performance, energy saving, and environmental sustainability in the long-run.","Spatial and temporal distribution of p,p'-DDE (1‑dichloro‑2,2‑bis (p‑chlorophenyl) ethylene) blood levels across the globe.

Therefore, this study aimed to assess the variation of soil CO2 emission (FCO2) and its relationship with soil attributes under long-term no-tillage systems with different successions of summer and winter crop sequences. Treatments consisted of combinations of three summer and two winter crop sequences. Summer sequences were maize monocrop (MM), soybean monocrop (SS), and soybean-maize intercrop (SM), while winter crops were crotalaria and maize. FCO2 showed no difference among summer sequences (p > 0.05). For winter crops, however, the soil under crotalaria crop residues presented higher FCO2 values (1.03 ± 0.027 μmol m-2 s-1) when compared to that under maize crop residues (0.94 ± 0.027 μmol m-2 s-1). Soil moisture presented the greatest influence on the temporal variation of FCO2, being correlated in the summer sequences MM (r = 0.79; p < 0.0001) and SS (r = 0.70; p = 0.002), as well as in the winter crops crotalaria (r = 0.78; p < 0.0001) and maize (r = 0.66; p = 0.005). In the Oxisol under no-tillage for >14 years, the spatial variation of FCO2 was explained by the soil physical attributes total porosity, macroporosity, microporosity, and soil temperature. The soil under crotalaria crop residues as a winter crop had an improvement in soil physical attributes, leading to a more aerated environment and hence a higher CO2 production process. However, the winter crops crotalaria (38.65 ± 0.08 Mg ha-1) and maize (38.14 ± 0.09 Mg ha-1) also provided a higher carbon stock on this tropical soil. Maize monocrop (41.13 ± 0.11 Mg ha-1) as a summer crop under no-tillage system also promoted higher carbon stocks on this tropical soil. A strategy to optimize no-tillage systems in terms of FCO2 reduction and increase in soil carbon stock is related to the adoption of crop cultivation that includes legumes and grasses under intercropping and succession. Therefore, our results suggested that the summer sequences used in this study might contribute to reducing FCO2 and that both winter crops influenced the increased soil carbon stock.",Emission and dispersal of antibiotic resistance genes through bioaerosols generated during the treatment of municipal sewage.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181526,The Science of the total environment,2019 06 14,"Wastewater treatment plants act as socio-ecological couplers through the concentration, treatment, and subsequent environmental release of sewage collected from surrounding communities and are often considered hotspots for antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB) and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). While studies have identified the release of ARB/ARGs in treated liquid sewage, little is known about potential dispersal through wastewater bioaerosol emissions. The aim of this study was to better define the contribution of WWTP bioaerosols to potential environmental distribution of ARB/ARGs. Bioaerosols were collected immediately upwind and downwind from the aeration tanks of a municipal wastewater treatment plant and liquid sludge samples were obtained from the aeration tanks. From the bioaerosol and liquid samples, qPCR assays identified 44 ARGs that confer resistance to a wide range of antibiotics. Comparison of the ARG profiles across samples showed that the downwind bioaerosol profile was 68% similar to the profile found in liquid sludge samples. Community 16S rRNA gene sequencing also showed that downwind bioaerosols had similar taxonomic profiles as those generated from liquid sludge while the upwind profiles showed a distinct difference. Preliminary ARG dispersion modeling estimated an ARG emission rate of ~10,620 genes per hour from the liquid sludge and indicated that the bioaerosols have the potential to be carried kilometers away from the WWTP source based on wind speed. The overall results from this study suggest that bioaerosols generated during WWTP processes can aid in the emission and dispersal of bacteria and ARGs, resulting in a possible route of human exposure and deposition into surrounding environments.",Investigation of the spatial variability of poly- and perfluoroalkyl substance trophic magnification in selected riverine ecosystems.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181525,The Science of the total environment,2019 06 14,"The occurrence at different trophic levels of 17 poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), including perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) and some of their precursors (e.g., perfluoroalkane sulfonamides, 6:2 fluorotelomer sulfonate (6:2 FTSA)), was investigated in riverine freshwater food webs in Southeastern France. Two fish species (Barbus barbus and Squalius cephalus) and various invertebrate taxa were collected in five rivers to assess the spatial variability of trophic magnification factors (TMFs). Particular attention was devoted to sample and data processing to minimize potential biases associated with the TMF determination. Fish were significantly more contaminated than invertebrates (ΣPFAS = 7-1811 vs. 0.9-213 ng g-1 wet weight (ww)). Those from the Rhône River presented significantly higher levels due to high concentrations of perfluoroundecanoic acid (406 ng g-1 ww) and perfluorotridecanoic acid (566 ng g-1 ww) ascribed to an industrial point source. Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) was dominant at the other sites (concentration range = 3.6-134 ng g-1 ww). Two linear regression models were compared (i.e., Kendall regression vs. Generalized Linear Mixed-Effect Model, GLMM). Results showed that TMFs calculated using the non-weighted Kendall regression were higher than those obtained using the GLMM approach. GLMM-based TMFs were consistently >1 for C9-C14 perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCAs), PFOS and perfluorodecane sulfonate (PFDS), indicating their apparent biomagnification in the investigated food webs. Comparatively, 6:2 FTSA and N-ethylperfluorooctane sulfonamidoacetic acid (N-EtFOSAA) were less often detected and were not significantly biomagnified, probably because of metabolization. TMF estimates were generally consistent across sites although some PFASs (in particular C9, C10 and C13 PFCAs) displayed higher variability, due to a unique extreme value that may have resulted from the contribution of unattributed precursor biotransformation.",Impact of photochemical ageing on Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAH) and oxygenated PAH (Oxy-PAH/OH-PAH) in logwood stove emissions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181524,The Science of the total environment,2019 06 14,"The combustion of spruce logwood in a modern residential stove was found to emit polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) and oxygenated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (OPAH) with emission factors of 404 μg MJ-1 of 35 analysed PAH, 317 μg MJ-1 of 11 analysed Oxy-PAH and 12.5 μg MJ-1 of 5 analysed OH-PAH, most of which are known as potential mutagens and carcinogens. Photochemical ageing in an oxidation flow reactor (OFR) degraded particle-bound PAH, which was also reflected in declining PAH toxicity equivalent (PAH-TEQ) values by 45 to 80% per equivalent day of photochemical ageing in the atmosphere. OPAH concentrations decreased less than PAH concentrations during photochemical ageing, supposedly due to their secondary formation, while 1-hydroxynaphthalene, 1,5-dihydroxynaphthalene and 1,8-naphthalaldehydic acid were significantly increased after ageing. Furthermore, secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation and aromatic compounds not included in targeted analysis were investigated by thermal-optical carbon analysis (TOCA) hyphenate to resonance-enhanced multi-photon ionisation time-of-flight mass spectrometry (REMPI-TOFMS). The commonly used PAH-source indicators phenanthrene/anthracene, fluoranthene/pyrene, retene/chrysene, and indeno[cd]pyrene/benzo[ghi]perylene remained stable during photochemical ageing, enabling identification of wood combustion emissions in ambient air. On the other hand, benz[a]pyrene/benz[e]pyrene and benz[a]anthracene/chrysene were found to decrease with increasing photochemical age. Retene/chrysene was not a proper classifier for the wood combustion emissions of this study, possibly due to more efficient combustion than in open wood burning, from which this diagnostic ratio was initially derived. This study motivates in-depth investigation of degradation kinetics of particle-bound species on different combustion aerosol as well as the consequences of photochemical ageing on toxicity and identification of wood combustion emissions in ambient air.",Riverine dissolved organic carbon and its optical properties in a permafrost region of the Upper Heihe River basin in the Northern Tibetan Plateau.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181523,The Science of the total environment,2019 06 14,"Riverine dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and its optical properties were investigated in two sub-river basins (Yeniugou and Hulugou river) of the Upper Heihe river basin in the northern Tibetan Plateau. The results showed that DOC concentrations ranged from 0.25 to 12.2 and 0.18-1.04 mg L-1 for Yeniugou and Hulugou river basin with an average of 0.82 and 0.33 mg L-1, respectively. Export of DOC from the studied river (YNG: ~0.86 Gg C yr-1) was lesser compared with other large river in the Tibetan Plateau and Arctic regions because of the small drainage area and lower DOC concentrations. There exhibited significant seasonality for DOC in Yeniugou river basin with higher values observed during late spring and summer; however, no such distinct trend was observed for DOC in the studied rivers of Hulugou river basin. In contrast, total dissolved nitrogen showed a slightly lower value during the summer season. A strong relationship was determined between DOC concentrations and spectral UV absorbance at 254 nm (SUVA254), absorption coefficients and spectral slope for both sub-river basins, attributing that the riverine DOM in the northern Tibetan Plateau has a remarkably high content of aromatic compounds in late spring and summer. Considering the less snow cover percentage, this study highlights the potential impacts of permafrost thaw on the riverine DOC and its characteristics in the permafrost region under climate change.",Emerging per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) in surface water and sediment of the North and Baltic Seas.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181522,The Science of the total environment,2019 06 14,"Along with the phase-out of legacy long-chain perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCAs), perfluoroalkane sulfonic acids (PFSAs) and their precursors, attention has been drawn to emerging per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs). This study is aimed at investigating the importance of selected emerging PFASs as pollutants in European coastal environments and a possible transition from legacy long-chain PFCAs and PFSAs to replacement compounds. Therefore, the spatial distribution of 29 PFASs was analysed in surface water and sediment of the North and Baltic Seas sampled in 2017. Levels of the replacement compound HFPO-DA were approximately three times higher than those of its predecessor PFOA in surface water from the North Sea, which is characterised by the influence of point sources and constant exchange with open water. Reanalysis of sample extracts from the last decade showed that HFPO-DA had already been present in 2011, when it had not yet been in focus. In the Baltic Sea with a limited water exchange and dominance of diffuse sources, the proportion of HFPO-DA was negligible, whereas long-chain PFCAs and PFSAs still contributed to ∑PFASs with about 30%. The emerging cyclic compound perfluoro-4-ethylcyclohexanesulfonate (PFECHS), which has not yet been reported in European coastal environments, was detected in 86% of the Baltic Sea samples. Influenced by sediment characteristics in addition to source-specific contributions, the spatial distribution of PFASs in surface sediments was more variable than for water samples. The linear isomer of the long-chain legacy substance PFOS was the predominant compound found over the entire study area. Of the emerging PFASs, 6:6 and 6:8 perfluoroalkyl phosphinic acids (PFPiAs) were identified close to potential industrial inputs and in sedimentation areas. The results show that particular emerging PFASs play a relevant role in the investigated coastal environments and that a shift to replacements is dependent on sources and geographical conditions.",Introduction to the virtual special issue monitoring ecological responses to air quality and atmospheric deposition in the Athabasca Oil Sands region the wood Buffalo environmental Association's Forest health monitoring program.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181521,The Science of the total environment,2019 06 14,"The expansion of oil sands resource development in the Athabasca Oil Sands Region in the early 1990's led to concerns regarding the potential ecological and health effects of increased emissions and deposition of acidic substances. Conditions attached to a 1994 approval for an oil sands facility expansion led to the creation of the Wood Buffalo Environmental Association, and its Terrestrial Environmental Effects Monitoring committee. This multi-stakeholder body was tasked with development and operation of an environmental (forest health) monitoring program for the detection of ecological responses to atmospheric emissions and deposition. Initially focused on acid deposition monitoring, jack pine forest, growing on sandy soils with limited acid buffering capacity, was selected as the receptor system. An initial set of 10 monitoring locations was established using the Canadian Acid Rain Network Early Warning System methodology (since increased to 27, with three lost to development). Ecological monitoring is on a 6-year cycle, with concurrent measures of soil, needle and lichen chemistry, and tree and understory condition, together with ongoing measurements of air quality and atmospheric deposition. Because jack pine forest edges facing the emissions sources were expected to be more exposed to acidic emissions, evaluation of stand edge monitoring locations began in 2008. Monitoring of a targeted suite of indicators began in 2012 at 25 jack pine stand edge monitoring sites. This special issue presents the results derived from biophysical sampling campaigns (1998 to 2013), coupled with ongoing ambient atmospheric, deposition and epiphytic lichen monitoring (data through 2017) and source apportionment studies, as well as papers contributed by others engaged in regional research and monitoring programs.

However, there is limited knowledge about the impact of NMs in the biota, especially the amphibians. The present study revised the historical use of amphibian species as a model system for nanoecotoxicological studies and summarized the data available in the scientific literature about the genotoxic, mutagenic, histopathological, embryotoxic and reproductive effects of NMs in different groups of amphibians. The interaction, bioaccumulation, mode of action (MoA) and ecotoxicity of NMs on amphibians were also revised. The nanoecotoxicological studies were conducted with 11 amphibian species, being eight species of the order Anura and three species of the order Caudata. Xenopus laevis was the most studied species. The studies were conducted mainly with inorganic NMs (72%) compared to organic ones. The nanoecotoxicity depends on NM behavior and transformation in the environment, as well as the developmental stages of amphibians. The known effects of NMs in amphibians were mainly reported with reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, oxidative stress, and genotoxic effects. Results emphasize the need for further studies testing the ecotoxicity of different NMs, concentrations and exposure periods at environmentally relevant approaches. Furthermore, standard protocols for nanoecotoxicological tests using amphibians are required. Revised data showed that amphibians are suitable organisms to assess the environmental impact of NMs and indicated significant research gaps concerning the ecotoxicity of NMs on freshwater ecosystems and recommendations for future researches."

Part A, Molecular and biomolecular spectroscopy",2019 06 13,"Artemisinin-based combination therapy is widely used for the treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria, and piperaquine (PQ) is one of the important partner drugs. During the biotransformation of PQ, M1 (N-oxidation product), M2 (N-oxidation product), M3 (carboxylic acid product), M4 (N-dealkylation product), and M5 (N-oxidated product of M4) are formed by cytochrome P450 pathways. Despite decades of clinical use, the interactions between PQ and its main metabolites (PQs) with human serum albumin (HSA) have not been reported. In the present study, the binding of PQs with HSA under physiological conditions was investigated systematically through fluorescence, circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, and molecular docking methods. The experimental results show that the intrinsic fluorescence quenching of HSA was induced by those compounds resulting from the formation of stable HSA-compound complexes. The main forces involved in the interactions between PQ, M1, and M2 which bind to HSA were hydrogen s and van der Waals forces, while the interactions of M3, M4, and M5 were driven by hydrophobic forces. The main binding sites of the compounds to HSA were also examined by classical fluorescent marker experiments and molecular docking studies. Binding constants (Kb) revealed that the affinities of the PQ, M1, M2, M3, and M4 to HSA were stronger than that of M5. Additionally, the binding rates of PQs with HSA were determined by ultrafiltration methods. Consistent with the binding constant results, the binding rate of M5 was lower than the binding rates of PQ, M1, M2, M3, and M4. Furthermore, PQs binding to HSA led to conformational and structural alterations of HSA, as revealed by multi-spectroscopic studies. In order to investigate one possible mechanism by which PQs inhibit the growth of malaria-causing Plasmodium parasites, 1H NMR spectroscopy was performed to investigate the interaction of the PQs with heme.

The XRD, DFT and FT-IR results show that the compound exists in the phenol-imine form in the solid state. HOMA indices support the aromatic structure of the compound. DFT calculations were performed to understand proton transfer process and relatively close values were obtained for the energies of tautomers. UV-vis studies prove the solvent dependence of the tautomerism in the compound by revealing the existence of both phenol-imine and keto-amine forms in polar solvents and only the phenol-imine form in apolar solvent. The TD-DFT results for the electronic transitions lead to the same conclusion as the absorption spectra. 1H NMR and 13C NMR studies at room and low (-60 °C) temperatures indicate that the tautomeric equilibrium occurs rapidly in the compound. Therefore, it is difficult to observe two tautomers. However, the presence of tautomeric structures is clearly seen in acetone‑d6, alternatively underlying the solvent and temperature dependence of tautomerism in the title compound.","Occurrences, levels and risk assessment studies of emerging pollutants (pharmaceuticals, perfluoroalkyl and endocrine disrupting compounds) in fish samples from Kalk Bay harbour, South Africa.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181501,"Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)",2019 06 14,"A comprehensive analysis of 15 target chemical compounds (pharmaceuticals and personal care product, perfluoroalkyl compounds and industrial chemicals) were carried out to determine their concentrations in selected commercially exploited, wild caught small and medium sized pelagic fish species and their organs (Thyrsites atun (snoek), Sarda orientalis (bonito), Pachymetopon blochii (panga) and Pterogymnus laniarius (hottentot)) obtained from Kalk Bay harbour, Cape Town.

HA loading significantly weakened the toxicity of nZVI, resulting in the higher soil microbial quantity and enzyme activities compared with CN. Additionally, the improvement of soil microecology by CNH and HA was positively correlated with the ratio of application, while CN was negatively correlated (except FDA enzyme activity) with these indexes. These results emphasized the potential of the synthesized CNH as a promising material to remediate Cr contaminated soil. Furthermore, details of possible mechanistic insight into the Cr remediation were carefully discussed.",A first step towards building spectral libraries as complementary tools for snake venom proteome/peptidome studies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181499,"Comparative biochemistry and physiology.

To study the influence of the photoperiod on adipose tissue, Fischer 344 rats were treated for 14 weeks with a long day (18 h light:6 h dark; LD) or a short day (6 h light:18 h dark; SD) and fed a standard diet (STD). Biometric measures, postprandial plasmatic parameters, gene expression in the retroperitoneal white adipose tissue (RWAT) and brown adipose tissue (BAT) and histology of the RWAT were analyzed. A second experiment with the same conditions and analysis was performed for 11 weeks with rats fed a cafeteria diet (CAF). In the STD experiment, the SD increased triglycerides and showed a tendency to reduce fat compared to the LD. In the RWAT, genes implicated in adipogenesis, lipogenesis and lipolysis were down-regulated, and the histological results showed a higher percentage of small adipocytes in the SD without changes in their total number. In the CAF experiment, lipogenesis and adipogenesis gene expression was increased in the SD, while adipocytes were smaller and their number increased. Both experiments showed in the SD a decrease in the BAT expression of lipid uptake and β-oxidation genes, while only the STD additionally showed a reduction in Ucp1 expression. In conclusion, the RWAT morphology and the expression of key genes for lipid metabolism in RWAT and BAT were influenced by the photoperiod; however, the changes observed in the RWAT were different depending on the diet."

DFC-M was not stable in solution due to the presence of oxazoline moiety, which provided further hindrance for analytical sample preparation and HPLC analysis. Hence, the mechanistic study on the in-solution degradation of DFC-M was carried out via online and offline UPLC-HR-ESI-MS as well as in-situ NMR, and the degradation pathways were proposed. This mechanistic information, together with the follow-up solution stability study, provided crucial information regarding the solution handling and mobile phase selection for DFC-M analysis during commercial processing.",An LC-MS/MS spectrometry method for the simultaneous determination of Rosuvastatin and Irbesartan in rat plasma: Insight into pharmacokinetic and drug-drug interaction studies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181484,Journal of pharmaceutical and biomedical analysis,2019 06 14,"The synergistic vascular protective effect of statins and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) is well known, however, the pharmacokinetic interaction among these classes is yet to be understood and the necessity of developing analytical methods for their determination in vivo is gradually increased. Herein, first chromatographic separation coupled tandem mass spectrometric was developed and fully validated for simultaneous measurement of rosuvastatin (ROS) and irbesartan (IRB) in rat plasma after oral administration. The two analytes were extracted from plasma sample using acetonitrile-induced protein precipitation then separated on an Agilent Eclipse Plus ODS (4.6 × 100 mm, 3.5 μm) column by gradient elution using 6 mM ammonium formate/0.1% formic acid and ACN at a flow rate 0.4 mL min-1.

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) exhibit therapeutic effects in a variety of pathological conditions and our group recently reported that their number increases in regenerating mouse LG. Since the therapeutic effects are suggested to arise from secreted trophic factors, the application of MSC-secreted proteins seems to be a promising approach to induce/enhance LG regeneration. Therefore, this study aims to optimize the isolation of murine LG-MSC and analyze their secretome to investigate its potential for LG epithelial cell survival in vitro. For optimization, LG-MSC were isolated by an explant technique or cell sorting and their secretome was investigated under normal and inflammatory conditions. Results showed that the secretome of MSC had beneficial effects on the viability of ethanol-damaged LG epithelial cells. Additional, Lipocalin-2, prosaposin, ras GTPase-activating protein-binding protein 1 (Rac1) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1), proteins that were up-regulated under inflammatory conditions, further improved the cell survival of ethanol-damaged LG epithelial cells. Interestingly, recovery of cell viability was highest, when the cells were incubated with STAT1. Summarizing, this study identified promising proteins for further studies on LG regeneration.","Tetrahydropyrazolo[1,5-a]pyridine-fused steroids and their in vitro biological evaluation in prostate cancer.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181481,European journal of medicinal chemistry,2019 06 14,"The androgen receptor (AR) is a steroid hormone receptor and its high expression and disruption of its regulation are strongly implicated in prostate cancer (PCa) development. One of the current therapies includes application of steroidal antiandrogens leading to blockade of the AR action by the abrogation of AR-mediated signaling. We introduced here novel 4,5,6,7-tetrahydropyrazolo[1,5-a]pyridine-fused steroidal compounds, described their synthesis based on [8π+2π] cycloaddition reactions of diazafulvenium methides with different steroidal scaffolds and showed their biological evaluation in different prostate cancer cell lines in vitro.

The antitumor efficacy of the representative compound 11x in mice was also evaluated, and the results showed that compound 11x effectively inhibited tumor growth and decreased tumor weight in animal models. Further investigation on mechanism of action indicated that compound 11x could inhibit colorectal cancer growth through ATG5-depenent autophagy pathway. Therefore, these quinoline derivatives are a new class of molecules that have the potential to be developed as new antitumor drugs.",A combined forecasting structure based on the L1 norm: Application to the air quality.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181479,Journal of environmental management,2019 06 14,"Air pollution is very harmful to the industrial production and public health. Therefore, it is necessary to predict the air pollution and release air quality levels to provide guidance for public production and life. In most previous studies, pollutant data were directly used for predictions, which are rarely based on the structural characteristics of the data itself. Therefore, a novel combined forecasting structure based on the L1 norm was designed, aiming at pollution contaminant monitoring and analysis. It comprises analysis, forecast, and evaluation. Firstly, the original data are decomposed into several components. Subsequently, each component is expanded into a matrix time series by phase space reconstruction. The forecast module is then used to carry out the weighted combination of the prediction results of the three models based on the L1 norm to determine the final prediction result and the process parameters are optimized using the multi-tracker optimization algorithm. Moreover, comprehensive fuzzy evaluation was applied to qualitatively analyze the air quality. The daily pollution sources in three cities in China are taken as examples to verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the established combined forecasting structure. The results show that the architecture has a great application potential in the field of air quality prediction.",Transcriptomic analyses of the biological effects of black carbon exposure to A549 cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181478,Journal of environmental management,2019 06 14,"Ambient black carbon (BC) is found to be associated with increased risk of diverse pulmonary diseases, including acute respiratory inflammation and decreased lung function. Freshly emitted BC (FBC) can be transformed into oxidized BC (OBC) through the photochemical oxidization in the air. How this oxidization process influences the toxicity of BC particles is unclear. Previous studies found FBC and OBC could induce oxidative stress and inflammation. This study aimed to further compare the regulating pathways and tried to reveal the crucial target genes caused by FBC and OBC in A549 cells based on transcriptomic data. A total of 47,000 genes in A549 cells after treated with FBC and OBC were examined using Affymetrix Human U133 plus 2.0 chips. Gene ontology (GO) classification (functional enrichment of differentially expressed genes) and Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) classification (pathway enrichment of differentially expressed genes) were conducted and crucial genes were screened. The results showed that top 50 GO terms of FBC and OBC were not completely consistent. The Go term of cation channel was only identified in OBC group, probably caused by the characteristic that zeta potential of OBC is negative, while, that of FBC is positive. In addition transient receptor potential melastatin 7 (trpm7) gene was suggested to be closely related to this process caused by OBC. There are 47 identical pathways in FBC and OBC group among the top 50 KEGG. The inconsistent pathways are mostly related to inflammation with different up-regulation or down-regulation trends of crucial genes. The KEGG results suggested that FBC and OBC both cause inflammatory responses, but through different regulating pathways. In conclusion, OBC and FBC could induce similar toxic endpoints in A549 cells, but the underline regulating processes are not exactly the same.",Environmental assessment of livestock farms in the context of BAT system introduction in Russia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181477,Journal of environmental management,2019 06 14,"The article focuses on the environmental and economic assessment of animal/poultry manure utilisation technologies as the sources of the greatest negative impact on environment from agriculture. This procedure is especially topical in the context of current transition to BAT system in Russia. Russian BAT reference books on intensive rearing of pigs and intensive rearing of poultry came into force on June 1, 2018. At present, the large-scale livestock farms face the difficult task of selecting efficient technologies for manure utilisation with due account for their performance potential and the opportunities for end products use. To address the relevant practical issues, the criteria for the environmental and economic assessment of technologies were developed for selecting the rational technological solutions adjusted to the conditions of particular agricultural enterprises. Environmental assessment was based on the nitrogen saving coefficient. The developed approaches were applied to a dairy farm for 2600 head, a poultry factory for 1 million head and a full-cycle pig rearing complex for 16,500 head. The best suited technologies of animal/poultry manure utilisation were substantiated for these enterprises, which would allow achieving the reduction in environmental pollution by nutrients at the economically justified costs."

Under optimum conditions, the gold recovery rate was more than 80% at a dilute concentration of Au3+. Model-fitting analysis indicated the adsorption of Au3+ was well described by the pseudo-second-order kinetic model and the Langmuir isotherm model. The maximum Au3+ adsorption was from 208 to 280 mg/g within the temperature range of 20-50 °C.

Effects of each treatment step on chemical composition, cellulose accessibility, and enzymatic digestibility of poplar sawdust was investigated. Acetic acid pretreatment remarkably increased cellulose accessibility while also producing a relatively high quantity of xylooligosaccharides (XOS) (37.6% of raw xylan). However, enzymatic digestibility remained low (28.3%) despite hemicellulose disruption. Post alkali treatment was next applied, leading to improvement on cellulose accessibility and enzymatic hydrolysis. Enzymatic hydrolysis was improved more significantly by successive alkali treatment with PEGDE. Its potential mechanisms attributable to enzymatic hydrolysis improvement were explored by revealing the changes to lignin properties.

Current pharmacokinetic models have been based on invasive methods to measure drug concentrations, limiting them in spatial resolution, and restricting the research to larger rodents. We developed an intracochlear pharmacokinetic model based on an imaging, learning-prediction (LP) paradigm for learning transport parameters in the murine cochlea. This was achieved using noninvasive micro-computed tomography imaging of the cochlea during in vivo infusion of a contrast agent at the basal end of scala tympani through a cochleostomy. Each scan was registered in 3-D to a cochlear atlas to segment the cochlear regions with high accuracy, enabling concentrations to be extracted along the length of each scala. These spatio-temporal concentration profiles were used to learn a concentration dependent diffusion coefficient, and transport parameters between the major scalae and to clearance. The LP model results are comparable to the current state of the art model, and can simulate concentrations for cases involving different infusion molecules and different drug delivery protocols. Forward simulation results with pulsatile delivery suggest the pharmacokinetic model can be used to optimize drug delivery protocols to reduce total drug delivered and the potential for toxic side effects. While developed in the challenging murine cochlea, the processes are scalable to larger animals and different drug infusion paradigms.",Targeting ER stress/ER stress response in myopathies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181458,Redox biology,2019 06 14,"There is more skeletal muscle tissue in the body than any other tissue and, as it is the organ of the majority of metabolic activity, muscle defect can affect the health of the entire body. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress due to defects in protein folding/degradation balance, altered calcium and lipid levels and alterations in ER-mitochondria contacts has recently been recognised as the pathogenic cause of many different myopathies. In addition, a maladaptive ER stress response triggered by ER stress and mediated by three ER stress sensors (PERK, IRE1 and ATF6) is involved in a failure to relieve muscle tissue from this stress. Targeting ER stress and the ER stress response pathway offers a broad range of opportunities for treating myopathies but, as the inhibition of the three ER stress sensors may not be safe because it could lead to unexpected effects; it therefore calls for careful analysis of the changes in downstream signal transduction in the different myopathies so these sub-pathways can be pharmacologically targeted.

In this study, we present an optimized mass spectrometry based protocol to identify and quantify chlorinated peptides from single proteins modified by HOCl (100 and 500 μM, within estimated pathophysiological levels), at a high level of sensitivity and accuracy. Particular emphasis was placed on 1) sensitive and precise detection of modification sites, 2) the avoidance of loss or artefactual creation of modifications, 3) accurate quantification of peptide abundance and reduction of missing values problem, 4) monitoring the dynamics of modification in samples exposed to different oxidant concentrations and 5) development of guidelines for verification of chlorination sites assignment. A combination of an optimised sample preparation protocol, and improved data analysis approaches have allowed identification of 33 and 15 chlorination sites in laminin and fibronectin, respectively, reported in previous manuscripts [1,2]. The method was subsequently tested on murine basement membrane extract, which contains high levels of laminin in a complex mixture. Here, 10 of the major chlorination sites in laminin were recapitulated, highlighting the utility of the method in detecting damage in complex samples."

The mechanisms of action of andrographolide in disease prevention and/or therapy include anti-inflammation, anti-oxidative stress, anti-apoptosis, and/or pro-apoptosis. Pharmacodynamic studies have shown that andrographolide can cross the blood brain barrier and distribute into different brain regions, and therefore its pharmacological effects in the central nervous system (CNS) have begun to be revealed in recent years. For example, andrographolide has been reported to reduce brain infarct volume in several models of cerebral ischemia. In models of Alzheimer's disease (AD), andrographolide not only reduces Aβ aggregation, but suppresses neuroinflammatory response and synaptic dysfunction, which could be evidenced by the reversal of microglia-mediated production of pro-inflammatory cytokines as well as AD-associated decreases in synaptic proteins, such as postsynaptic membrane dense substance-95. Andrographolide may also inhibit the onset and/or progression of Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, and surgery- or diabetes-induced cognitive impairment. Further, andrographolide has been shown to inhibit chronic stress-induced abnormalities in serum corticosterone levels, mood-associated behavior, and hippocampal neurogenesis, suggesting that andrographolide may have a potential to treat psychiatric disorders, such as anxiety and depression. In this review, we summarize and discuss the pharmacological effects of andrographolide in the CNS in hope of revealing more possibilities of andrographolide in disease prevention and/or therapy.",An acellular tissue matrix-based drug carriers with dual chemo-agents for colon cancer growth suppression.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181443,Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,2019 06 14,"Relapse, metastasis, and chemo-resistance are the main factors responsible for the failure of surgical treatment of malignant tumors, and typically are the main obstacles to effective cancer treatment. Although significant advances have been made in the field of cancer chemotherapy, many patients still receive inadequate treatment due to the severe adverse effects of these drugs, resulting in an inability to reach therapeutic concentrations at the tumor site with systemic chemotherapy. Thus, a biological patch loaded with chemotherapeutic drugs could be an ideal strategy for the treatment of cancer at the tumor site.","LncRNA LINC00689 promotes the growth, metastasis and glycolysis of glioma cells by targeting miR-338-3p/PKM2 axis.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181442,Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,2019 06 14,"Accumulating evidence supports that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are implicated in the tumorigenesis and progression of glioma. Recent studies find that lncRNA long intergenic non-protein coding RNA 689 (LINC00689) is associated with obesity and participates in eukaryotic gene expression. However, whether LINC00689 plays a critical role in glioma progression remains unknown. Here, we identified a highly expressed lncRNA LINC00689 in gliomas compared to normal brain tissues based on the GSE dataset (GSE4290). The analysis of our data indicated that the expression of LINC00689 was up-regulated in glioma tissues and cell lines. Moreover, the high expression of LINC00689 was closely correlated with tumor size ≥3 cm, high tumor grade, low KPS scores and poor prognosis of glioma patients. Further investigation demonstrated that LINC00689 knockdown markedly repressed the proliferation, migration, invasion and glycolysis of glioma cells. Additionally, silencing of LINC00689 significantly suppressed the growth of glioma cells in vivo. Mechanistically, LINC00689 functioned as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) by directly interacting with miR-338-3p to promote pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) expression. Notably, we also revealed that restoration of PKM2 abolished the effects of LINC00689 silencing on glioma cell proliferation, migration, invasion and glycolysis. In summary, our results suggested that LINC00689/miR-338-3p/PKM2 axis might play an essential role in glioma progression.","J-2156, a somatostatin receptor type 4 agonist, alleviates mechanical hyperalgesia in a rat model of chronic low back pain.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181441,Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,2019 06 14,"Chronic low back pain (LBP) ranks among the most common reasons for patient visits to healthcare providers. Drug treatments often provide only partial pain relief and are associated with considerable side-effects. J-2156 [(1'S,2S)-4amino-N-(1'-carbamoyl-2'-phenylethyl)-2-(4""-methyl-1""-naphthalenesulfonylamino)butanamide] is an agonist that binds with nanomolar affinity to the rat and human somatostatin receptor type 4 (SST4 receptor). Hence, our aim was to assess the efficacy of J-2156 for relief of chronic mechanical LBP in a rat model. Male Sprague Dawley rats were anaesthetised and their lumbar L4/L5 and L5/L6 intervertebral discs (IVDs) were punctured (0.5 mm outer diameter, 2 mm-deep) 10 times per disc. Sham-rats underwent similar surgery, but without disc puncture. For LBP-rats, noxious pressure hyperalgesia developed in the lumbar axial deep tissues from day 7 to day 21 post-surgery, which was maintained until study completion. Importantly, mechanical hyperalgesia did not develop in the lumbar axial deep tissues of sham-rats. In LBP-rats, single intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of J-2156 (3, 10, 30 mg kg-1) alleviated primary and secondary hyperalgesia in the lumbar axial deep tissues at L4/L5 and L1, respectively. This was accompanied by a reduction in the otherwise augmented lumbar (L4-L6) dorsal root ganglia expression levels of the pro-nociceptive mediators: phosphorylated p38 (pp38) mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphorylated p44/p42 MAPK and a reduction in pp38 MAPK in the lumbar enlargement of the spinal cord.

Ischemia lasted 80 min at 30 °C. Melatonin was given before ischemia (UI80 + M1, HTK80 + M1) or before and after ischemia (UI80 + M2, HTK80 + M2). We measured the left ventricular developed pressure (LVDP), diastolic pressure (LVPmin), cardiac rhythm (VC-RR), time of electrical cell uncoupling (t-in) and recovery (t-ret), intracellular Ca++ [Ca++], and postischemic ROS. After 45 min reperfusion, LVDP in UI80 was significantly higher than in HTK80 (p < .01). Compared to UI80, the postischemic ROS burst was slightly smaller in HTK80 and significantly smaller in HTK80 + M1 and HTK80 + M2 (p < .05).

Identifying the neural mechanisms that underlie this process will contribute to our understanding of how we realize adaptive self-control in daily life. Here, we focused on the neural substrates that allow us to voluntarily utilize prospective metacognition to carry out such action selection. Participants were asked to bet on their recall of sound stimuli presented at an earlier time in a delayed match-to-sample task of rapidly changing sound stimuli. During the task, brain activity was measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging. We found that the brain network composed of the ventral and dorsal parts of the medial prefrontal cortex and the medial precuneus regulated the strategic selection of risk/return profiles based on metacognition. In particular, increments in functional connectivity between the ventral and dorsal medial prefrontal cortices during high-risk/return bets correlated with the adaptiveness of the bet (as measured by the correspondence between choosing high risk/return bets and high accuracy of task performance). This index is considered to reflect the degree of voluntary use of metacognition to bet. These findings suggest that the strong connectivity within the network involving the ventral and dorsal medial prefrontal cortices enables us to utilize metacognition to select actions for achieving a goal efficiently.",The functional organisation of the hippocampus along its long axis is gradual and predicts recollection.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181420,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,2019 06 14,"Understanding the functional organisation of the hippocampus is crucial for understanding its role in cognition and disorders in which it is implicated.

Here, we applied a novel 'connectopic mapping' data-analysis approach to the resting-state fMRI data of participants of the Human Connectome Project, and demonstrate that the functional organisation of the hippocampal longitudinal axis is gradual rather than segregated into parcels. In addition, we show that inter-individual variations in this gradual organisation predict variations in recollection memory better than a characterisation based on functional parcellation.

Thrombolytic therapy with tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) is one of the mainstream treatments, but it still has many problems, including short half-life, and t-PA-induced reperfusion and oxidative injuries. To broaden the therapeutic window of t-PA and reduce its associated oxidative stress after reperfusion, t-PA-installed, nitroxide radical-containing, self-assembled polyion complex nanoparticles (t-PA@iRNP) were designed. Encapsulation of t-PA in the self-assembled antioxidant nanoparticles improved its bioavailability and extended its therapeutic window. To suppress reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the ischemic penumbra area, the low-molecular-weight nitroxide antioxidant 4-amino-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl was covalently conjugated with the nanoparticle matrix, thus suppressing oxidative damage in the brain after reperfusion. t-PA and nitroxide radicals were confined and protected in the core of t-PA@iRNP, thereby preventing their rapid metabolism and excretion out of the body after systemic circulation for prolonged period. The nano-sized formulation prevented non-specific internalization of t-PA@iRNP in healthy cells, thereby preserving the normal function of redox reactions in the cells, especially important redox reactions such as electron transport chains. This improved pharmacological performance of t-PA@iRNP remarkably extended the in vivo half-life of t-PA in systemic circulation. Using a mouse model of photo-thrombotic middle cerebral artery occlusion, we found that t-PA@iRNP treatment, compared with naked t-PA, void iRNP, or t-PA@niRNP (non-ROS scavenging nanoparticle as a control), significantly suppressed increases in cerebral infarct volume and improved neurological deficit after brain ischemia. t-PA-induced subarachnoid hemorrhage was also suppressed by t-PA@iRNP treatment through elimination of overproduced ROS. Based on these data, t-PA@iRNP presents therapeutic potential through synergistic effect of thrombolysis and antioxidant effects for preventing and treating ischemia-reperfusion injury."

Elucidating the pathways by which 5-HTTLPR contributes to depression could resolve this controversy. Insomnia independently contributes to the onset and course of negative affective symptoms and, hence, represents one of the primary risk factors for depression. To evaluate the relevance of this relationship for the interaction between 5-HTTLPR and stress in depression, the present review investigated the moderating influence of 5-HTTLPR on the relationship between stress and sleep quality as well as on the relationship between sleep and affective symptomatology.",His bundle has shorter chronaxie than adjacent ventricular myocardium: Implications for pacemaker programming.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181375,Heart rhythm,2019 06 10,Strength-duration curves for permanent His bundle (HB) pacing are potentially important for pacemaker programming.,"Twenty-year trends in profile, management and outcomes of patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction according to use of reperfusion therapy: Data from the FAST-MI program 1995-2015.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181374,American heart journal,2019 06 12,"The increased use of reperfusion therapy in ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients in the past decades is generally considered the main determinant of improved outcomes.

One possible explanation may be related to the post-translational modification of plasticity-related receptors and their associated intracellular signaling molecules, given that these proteins are integral to the development of synaptic plasticity. In particular, phosphorylation governs the biophysical properties (e.g., Ca2+ conductance) and the migratory patterns (i.e., trafficking) of plasticity-related receptors by altering the relative density of specific receptor subunits at synapses. We hypothesized that a single session of exercise would alter the subunit phosphorylation of plasticity-related receptors (AMPA receptors, NMDA receptors) and signaling molecules (PKA, CaMKII) in a manner that would serve to prime motor cortex. Young, male Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 24) were assigned to either exercise (Moderate, Exhaustion), or non-exercising (Sedentary) groups. Immediately following a single session of treadmill exercise, whole tissue homogenates were prepared from both the motor cortex and hippocampus. We observed a robust (1.2-2.0x greater than sedentary) increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of AMPA (GluA1,2) and NMDA (GluN2A,B) receptor subunits, and a clear indication that exercise preferentially affects pPKA over pCaMKII. The changes were found, specifically, following moderate, but not maximal, acute aerobic exercise in both motor cortex and hippocampus. Given the requirement for these proteins during the early phases of plasticity induction, the possibility exists that exercise-induced priming may occur by altering the phosphorylation of plasticity-related proteins.",Pairwise Interactions among Brain Regions Organize Large-Scale Functional Connectivity during Execution of Various Tasks.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181368,Neuroscience,2019 06 16,"Spatially separated brain areas interact with each other to form networks with coordinated activities, supporting various brain functions. Interaction structures among brain areas have been widely investigated through pairwise measures. However, interactions among multiple (e.g., triple and quadruple) areas cannot be reduced to pairwise interactions. Such higher order interactions (HOIs), e.g., exclusive-or (XOR) operation, are widely implemented in computation systems and are crucial for effective information processing. However, it is currently unclear whether any HOIs are present in large-scale brain functional networks when subjects are executing specific tasks. Here we analyzed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data collected from human subjects executing various perceptual, motor, and cognitive tasks. We found that HOI strength in the macroscopic functional networks was very weak for all tasks, suggesting that major brain activities do not rely on HOIs on the macroscopic level at the timescale of hundreds of milliseconds. These weak HOIs during tasks were further investigated with a neural network model activated by external inputs, which suggested that weak pairwise interactions among brain areas organized the system without involving HOIs. Taken together, these results demonstrated the dominance of pairwise interactions in organizing coordinated activities among different brain areas to support various brain functions."

Its total extract was first revealed with xanthine oxidase (XO) inhibitory activity in vitro and anti-hyperuricemic effect in vivo. Bioassay-guided separation on Fr. A5 yielded six chalcone-flavonone heterodimers, termipaniculatones A-F. Their structures were elucidated based on extensive spectroscopic analyses involving HRESIMS, 1D and 2D NMR, UV, IR and [α]D, and the absolute configuration of termipaniculatone F was verified by ECD calculation. Termipaniculatones A and E showed obvious XO inhibitory activity with IC50 values of 55.6 and 89.5 μM, respectively, which took effects via a mix-type mode. A molecular modeling study revealed that termipaniculatone A was well located into the active site of XO by interacting with Glu802, Arg880, Thr1010 and Val1011 residues.

However, its success rate may depend on what the clue is for the repositioning. Recently, repositioning based on correction of unwarranted gene expression pattern has suggested the possibility of new drug development. Here, we designed a similar method for the repositioning of nutraceutical ginseng (Panax ginseng C.A.Mey.), which is one of the most validated natural therapeutic products for various diseases. We analyzed ginseng-induced gene expression profiles using the connectivity map algorithm, which is a database that connects diseases, chemical drugs, and gene expression. Ginseng was predicted to show the same effects as those of topoisomerase I inhibitors. In a subsequent in vitro assay, ginseng extract unwound coiled or supercoiled DNA, an effect comparable to that of the topoisomerase I inhibitor, camptothecin. Furthermore, ginseng extract induced synthetic lethality with suppression of the Werner syndrome gene. The collected data implicate ginseng as a candidate antitumor agent owing to its topoisomerase I inhibitory activity and further validate the usefulness of differentially expressed gene similarity-based repurposing of other natural products.",Benzylpenicillin versus flucloxacillin for penicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infections from a large retrospective cohort study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181352,International journal of antimicrobial agents,2019 06 10,"In clinical practice, differing opinion exists as to the optimal management of patients with penicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (PSSA) bloodstream infections (BSIs). The aim of this study was to compare 30-day mortality of patients treated with benzylpenicillin or flucloxacillin. We compared 30-day mortality for patients treated with flucloxacillin or benzylpenicillin for PSSA BSIs from a large prospective data set from Australia and New Zealand. We used a logistic regression model and a propensity score treatment analysis using inverse probability of treatment weighting. 915 patients were included in the study with an overall mortality rate of 12.9% (benzylpenicillin 10.5%, 33/315 and flucloxacillin 14.2%, 85/600). Endocarditis was associated with benzylpenicillin treatment choice, whereas dialysis and skin and soft tissue infection was associated with flucloxacillin treatment. In the multivariate analysis, an increased mortality was associated with flucloxacillin compared to benzylpenicillin (OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.0 - 2.5, p = 0.05). When adjusted for treatment choice in the propensity score analysis, flucloxacillin was again associated with increased mortality (OR 1.05, 95% CI 1.01 - 1.1, p = 0.03).

The lifetime of an antibubble is governed by the drainage of the gas between the two liquid-gas interfaces populated by surfactants. Depending on the relative magnitude of surface viscosity and elastic moduli, which directly depend on or are determined by the nature of surfactants, the lifetime of an antibubble may vary a lot, from few seconds to few minutes. While such a difference can be predicted with models that include the role of interfacial properties, they were not observed experimentally in previous studies, due to important sources of dispersion. In this review, the main sources of dispersion are identified, such as (i) the initial amount of gas embedded in the antibubble, (ii) the level of saturation of gas in the bulk liquid, (iii) the presence of dust particles (<0.5 μm) in the gas, and (iv) three-dimensional flow effects. By accounting for these various effects, we obtain a coherent view on the lifetime of an antibubble, as a function of its radius and the surface rheology, with excellent consistency between experiments and modeling. Results thus demonstrate that controlling the size and lifetime of antibubbles is achievable.",Long-range forces and charge inversions in model charged colloidal dispersions at finite concentration.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181349,Advances in colloid and interface science,2019 06 12,"In charged colloidal dispersion systems the interest is in finding their stability conditions, phase transitions, and transport properties, either in bulk or confinement, among other physicochemical quantities, for which the knowledge of the dispersions' molecular structure and the associated macroion-macroion forces is crucial. To investigate these phenomena simple models have been proposed. Most of the theoretical and simulation studies on charged particles suspensions are at infinite dilution conditions. Hence, these studies have been focused on the electrolyte structure around one or two isolated central particle(s), where phenomena as charge reversal, charge inversion and surface charge amplification have been shown to be relevant. However, experimental studies at finite volume fraction exhibit interesting phenomenology which imply very long-range correlations. A simple, yet useful, model is the Colloidal Primitive Model, in which the colloidal dispersion is modeled as a mixture of size (and charge) asymmetrical hard spheres, at finite volume fraction. In this paper we review recent integral equations solutions for this model, where very long-range attractive-repulsive forces, as well as new long-range, giant charge inversions are reported.

Deposited macrophages promote atherosclerotic lesion progression; therefore they are viewed as the main targets in order to alleviate atherosclerosis. Danlou tablet, a patented Chinese Medicine, has long been used to treat cardiovascular diseases. In the present study, we used Apolipoprotein E-deficient (ApoE-/-) mice model and in vitro cell line of RAW264.7 to explore the mechanisms of ethanol extracts of Danlou tablet (EEDT) in treating atherosclerosis. The potential targets that EEDT works to treat atherosclerosis were predicted by ""Network pharmacology analysis"", based on which we designed mRNA array of 93 genes. Then mRNA array and oil red O staining were performed in aortic extracted from the cohorts of Control (C57BL/6 mice, chow fed), Model (ApoE-/- C57BL/6 mice, 20 weeks of high-fat diet) and EEDT intervening (ApoE-/- mice, 20 weeks of high-fat diet with 12 weeks of EEDT treatment) group. Furthermore, mRNA array, inflammation cytokines and lipid content were examined in RAW264.7 cell line. It was showed that EEDT decreased the expressions of inflammation cytokines by down regulating NF-κB singling pathway and accelerated cholesterol effluent through activating PPARα/ABCA1 signaling pathway. On the other hand, activation of NF-κB pathway or suppression of PPARα/ABCA1 signaling pathway both abolished the therapeutic effect of EEDT. In conclusion, EEDT played a key role in anti-inflammation and preventing lipid deposition in macrophages of atherosclerosis via suppressing NF-κB signaling and triggering PPARα/ABCA1 signaling pathway.",Paeoniflorin protects against intestinal ischemia/reperfusion by activating LKB1/AMPK and promoting autophagy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181335,Pharmacological research,2019 06 16,"Intestinal ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury is a common pathological process with high clinical morbidity and mortality. Paeoniflorin, a monoterpene glucoside, is found to have diverse health beneficial effects including autophagy modulation, anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, and anti-oxidative effects. Based on our pre-experiments, we proposed that paeoniflorin could ameliorate intestinal I/R injury and restore autophagy through activating LKB1/AMPK signal pathway. Our proposal was verified using rat intestinal I/R model in vivo and intestinal epithelial cell line (IEC-6 cells) hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) model in vitro. Our results showed that paeoniflorin pretreatment exerted protective effects in rat intestinal I/R injury by reducing intestinal morphological damage, inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis. Paeoniflorin restored H/R-impaired autophagy flux by up-regulating autophagy-related protein p62/SQSTM1 degradation, LC3II and beclin-1 expression, and autophagosomes synthesis without significantly affecting control IEC-6 cells. Paeoniflorin pretreatment significantly activated LKB1/AMPK signaling pathway by reversing the decreased LKB1 and AMPK phosphorylation without affecting total LKB1 both in vivo and in vitro. LKB1 knockdown reduced AMPK phosphorylation, suppressed LC3II and Beclin-1 level, and decreased the degradation of SQSTM/p62, and the knockdown weakened the effects of paeoniflorin in restoring the impaired autophagy flux in H/R injured IEC-6 cells, suggesting that paeoniflorin mitigated the intestinal I/R-impaired autophagy flux by activating LKB1/AMPK signaling pathway.

However, the effect of CTS on pulmonary fibrosis is unknown. This study aims to investigate the effects of CTS treatment on pulmonary fibrosis and its underlying mechanism. The pulmonary fibrosis model was established by intratracheal instillation of bleomycin (5 mg/kg) in Sprague-Dawley rats (in vivo) and stimulating human fetal lung fibroblasts (HLFs) with transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-β1) (in vitro). CTS (7.5, 15, 30, 60 mg/kg/day) and pirfenidone (150 mg/kg/day, positive control) were administered by oral gavage for 28 days. In this study, we found CTS treatment improved pulmonary function, relieved pathological changes and attenuated the accumulation of extracellular matrix in pulmonary fibrosis rat model induced by bleomycin. Mechanistically, CTS suppressed phosphorylation of Smad2/3 and STAT3 induced by TGF-β1 in HLFs. Stattic, a 1-benzothiophene based small-molecule STAT3 inhibitor, resulted in a significant down-regulation of fibrosis biomarkers including fibronectin, collagen type I and alpha smooth muscle actin (α-SMA). Overexpression of STAT3 promoted expression of fibrosis biomarkers in HLFs cell model induced by TGF-β1 and partially blocked the inhibitory effect of CTS on TGF-β1-induced fibrosis response. Taken together, these results suggested that CTS protects against pulmonary fibrosis via inhibition of Smad and STAT3 signaling pathways. Thus, CTS may represent a promising drug candidate for treating pulmonary fibrosis.",In vivo widefield calcium imaging of the mouse cortex for analysis of network connectivity in health and brain disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181333,NeuroImage,2019 06 10,"The organization of brain areas in functionally connected networks, their dynamic changes, and perturbations in disease states are subject of extensive investigations. Research on functional networks in humans predominantly uses functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). However, adopting fMRI and other functional imaging methods to mice, the most widely used model to study brain physiology and disease, poses major technical challenges and faces important limitations. Hence, there is great demand for alternative imaging modalities for network characterization. Here, we present a refined protocol for in vivo widefield calcium imaging of both cerebral hemispheres in mice expressing a calcium sensor in excitatory neurons. We implemented a stringent protocol for minimizing anesthesia and excluding movement artifacts which both imposed problems in previous approaches. We further adopted a method for unbiased identification of functional cortical areas using independent component analysis (ICA) on resting-state imaging data. Biological relevance of identified components was confirmed using stimulus-dependent cortical activation. To explore this novel approach in a model of focal brain injury, we induced photothrombotic lesions of the motor cortex, determined changes in inter- and intrahemispheric connectivity at multiple time points up to 56 days post-stroke and correlated them with behavioral deficits. We observed a severe loss in interhemispheric connectivity after stroke, which was partially restored in the chronic phase and associated with corresponding behavioral motor deficits. Taken together, we present an improved widefield calcium imaging tool accounting for anesthesia and movement artifacts, adopting an advanced analysis pipeline based on human fMRI algorithms and with superior sensitivity to recovery mechanisms in mouse models compared to behavioral tests. This tool will enable new studies on interhemispheric connectivity in murine models with comparability to human imaging studies for a wide spectrum of neuroscience applications in health and disease.",Trial-by-trial source-resolved EEG responses to gait task challenges predict subsequent step adaptation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181332,NeuroImage,2019 06 10,"A growing body of evidence indicates a pivotal role of cognition and in particular executive function in gait control and fall prevention. In a recent gait study using electroencephalographic (EEG) imaging, we provided direct proof for cortical top-down inhibitory control in step adaptation. A crucial part of motor inhibition is recognizing stimuli that signal the need to inhibit or adjust motor actions such as steps during walking. One of the EEG signatures of performance monitoring in response to events signaling the need to adjust motor responses, are error-related potential (error-ERP) features. To examine whether error-ERP features may index executive control during gait adaptation, we analyzed high-density (108-channel) EEG data from an auditory gait pacing study. Participants (N = 18) walking on a steadily moving treadmill were asked to step in time to an auditory cue tone sequence, and then to quickly adapt their step length and rate, to regain step-cue synchrony following occasional unexpected shifts in the pacing cue train to a faster or slower cue tempo. Decomposition of the continuous EEG data by independent component analysis revealed a negative deflection in the source-resolved event-related potential (ERP) time locked to 'late' cue tones marking a shift to a slower cue tempo. This vertex-negative ERP feature, localized primarily to posterior medial frontal cortex (pMFC) and peaking 250 ms after the onset of the tempo-shift cue, we here refer to as the step-cue delay negativity (SDN). SDN source, timing, and polarity resemble other error-related ERP features, e.g., the Error-Related Negativity (ERN) and Feedback-Related Negativity (FRN) in (seated) button press response tasks. In single trials, SDN amplitude varied with the magnitude of the cue latency deviation (the time interval between the expected and actual cue onsets). Regression analysis also identified linear coupling between SDN amplitude and the subsequent speed of gait tempo adaptation (as measured by the increase in length of the ensuing adaptation step). The SDN in this paradigm thus seems both to index the perceived need for and the subsequent magnitude of the immediate gait adjustment, consistent with performance-monitoring models. Future research might investigate relationships of these control processes to the impairment of gait adjustment in motor disorders and cognitive decline, for example to develop a biomarker for fall risk prediction in early-stage Parkinson's.",Inflammation and Cerebral Small Vessel Disease: A Systematic Review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181331,Ageing research reviews,2019 06 10,"Inflammation is increasingly implicated as a risk factor for dementia, stroke, and small vessel disease (SVD). However, the underlying mechanisms and causative pathways remain unclear. We systematically reviewed the existing literature on the associations between markers of inflammation and SVD (i.e., white matter hyperintensities (WMH), lacunes, enlarged perivascular spaces (EPVS), cerebral microbleeds (CMB)) in cohorts of older people with good health, cerebrovascular disease, or cognitive impairment. Based on distinctions made in the literature, markers of inflammation were classified as systemic inflammation (e.g. C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, fibrinogen) or vascular inflammation/endothelial dysfunction (e.g. homocysteine, von Willebrand factor, Lp-PLA2). Evidence from 82 articles revealed relatively robust associations between SVD and markers of vascular inflammation, especially amongst stroke patients, suggesting that alterations to the endothelium and blood-brain barrier may be a driving force behind SVD. Conversely, cross-sectional findings on systemic inflammation were mixed, although longitudinal investigations demonstrated that elevated levels of systemic inflammatory markers at baseline predicted subsequent SVD severity and progression. Importantly, regional analysis revealed that systemic and vascular inflammation were differentially related to two distinct forms of SVD. Specifically, markers of vascular inflammation tended to be associated with SVD in areas typical of hypertensive arteriopathy (e.g., basal ganglia), while systemic inflammation appeared to be involved in CAA-related vascular damage (e.g., centrum semiovale). Nonetheless, there is insufficient data to establish whether inflammation is causal of, or secondary to, SVD. Findings have important implications on interventions, suggesting the potential utility of treatments targeting the brain endothelium and blood brain barrier to combat SVD and associated neurodegenerative diseases.",Menstrual suppression in paediatric and adolescent patients with disabilities ranging from developmental to acquired conditions: A population study in an Australian Quaternary Paediatric and Adolescent Gynaecology Service from January 2005 to December 2015.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181330,Journal of pediatric and adolescent gynecology,2019 06 10,"The aim of this study was to review the efficacy of different medical modalities for menstrual suppression in the cohort of patients with disabilities presenting to the Queensland Paediatric and Adolescent (PAG) Gynaecology Service between January 2005 and December 2015.

Some biological drugs currently used in the therapy of JIA can interfere with these mechanisms.",P2X7 receptor: A potential therapeutic target for autoimmune diseases.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181327,Autoimmunity reviews,2019 06 10,"P2X7 receptor (P2X7R), a distinct ligand-gated ion channel, is a member of purinergic type 2 receptor family with ubiquitous expression in human body. Previous studies have revealed a pivotal role of P2X7R in innate and adaptive immunity. Once activated, it will meditate some vital cascaded responses including the assembly of nucleotide-binding domain (NOD) like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome, non-classical secretion of IL-1β, modulation of cytokine-independent pathways in inflammation such as P2X7R- transglutaminase-2 (TG2) and P2X7R-cathepsin pathway, activation and regulation of T cells, etc. In fact, above responses have been identified to be involved in the development of autoimmunity, specifically, the NLRP3 inflammasome could promote inflammation in massive autoimmune diseases and TG2, as well as cathepsin may contribute to joint destruction and degeneration in inflammatory arthritis. Recently, numerous evidences further suggested the significance of P2X7R in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), multiple sclerosis (MS), etc. In this review, we will succinctly discuss the biological characteristics and summarize the recent progress of the involvement of P2X7R in the development and pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases, as well as its clinical implications and therapeutic potential."

Our study analyzed the role of CASC11 in ovarian squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). In the present study we showed that plasma CASC11 was upregulated in OSCC, and the upregulation of CASC11 distinguished OSCC patients from control group. Plasma levels of CASC11 were further increased after chemotherapy. Treatment with oxaliplatin, tetraplatin, cisplatin, and carboplatin mediated the upregulation of CASC11 in cells of OSCC cell line. In addition, overexpression of CASC11 led to increased cancer cell viability under oxaliplatin, tetraplatin, cisplatin, and carboplatin treatment, while CASC11 siRNA silencing played an opposite role. Therefore, overexpression of CASC11 in OSCC mediated the development of cancer cell resistance to chemotherapy.",miR-454-3p exerts tumor-suppressive functions by down-regulation of NFATc2 in glioblastoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181312,Gene,2019 06 16,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most prevalent and malignant primary brain tumor. Numerous studies have demonstrated that aberrant microRNAs (miRNAs) expression is involved in various pathogenesis events in GBM. miR-454-3p has been found to be downregulated in GBM, however, the role and underlying mechanism has not been fully investigated. The expression levels of miR-454-3p in GBM clinical tissues and cultured cell lines were measured by qRT-PCR. To evaluate the role of miR-454-3p in GBM, GBM cells were transfected with miR-454-3p inhibitor (anti-miR-454-3p)/control inhibitor (anti-miR-NC) or miR-454-3p mimic/control mimic (miR-NC). Online prediction algorithm Targetscan was used to predict the target genes of miR-454-3p. The dual luciferase reporter gene assay was performed to confirm whether nuclear factor of activated T cells c2 (NFATc2) was a direct biological target of miR-454-3p. We found that miR-454-3p expression was significantly decreased in both GBM tissues and cultured cell lines. Overexpression of miR-454-3p by transfection with miR-454-3p mimic suppressed cell proliferation and induced apoptosis of GBM cells. Nuclear factor of activated T cells c2 (NFATc2) was predicted as a target gene of miR-454-3p. We found that NFATc2 expression was significantly increased in both GBM tissues and cultured cell lines. Besides, expression levels of miR-454-3p were negatively associated with NFATc2 expression in GBM tissues. NFATc2 knockdown in GBM cells obviously inhibited cell proliferation and elevated apoptosis. Luciferase reporter assay revealed that NFATc2 was a target gene of miR-454-3p. miR-454-3p overexpression suppressed the NFATc2 expression, while inhibition of miR-454-3p induced the NFATc2 expression. Suppression of NFATc2 blocked the effects of miR-454-3p inhibitor on cell proliferation and apoptosis in GBM cells. The results indicated that miR-454-3p executed the tumor suppressive activity via downregulating NFATc2 in GBM.",Potential association between TSGA13 variants and risk of total colonic aganglionosis in Hirschsprung disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181311,Gene,2019 06 16,"Hirschsprung disease (HSCR) is a congenital rare disorder and a kind of developmental neuropathies, characterized by the lack of enteric neurons in variable segments of distal bowel. Our recent genome-wide association study identified a variant (rs13223150) of testis-specific A13 (TSGA13) as a potential risk locus for total colonic aganglionosis (TCA) in HSCR. The aim of this study was to identify the impact of the variant (rs13223150) and potential association of genetic variations of TSGA13 with TCA in HSCR. This study performed a fine mapping and extended analyses in Korean population. A total of 9 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of TSGA13 were genotyped in a larger HSCR cohort (187 HSCR patients and 283 unaffected controls), and extended genetic analyses using various genetic modelling, haplotype, and combined analyses were performed. The rs13223150_A allele showed a significant association with TCA (P = 0.003), even after correcting for multiple testing (Pcorr = 0.02). One haplotype (BL1_ht1, G-A-C-C) including rs13223150 also showed a significant association with TCA (P = 0.002, Pcorr = 0.01). Further combined imputation analysis indicated that several single nucleotide polymorphisms of TSGA13 were significantly associated with TCA in HSCR. Although replications in other population cohorts and functional evaluations are needed, our results suggest that TSGA13 genetic variants may affect TCA in HSCR and/or the extent of aganglionosis during enteric nervous system development.",Effect of minor manufacturing changes on stability of compositionally equivalent PLGA microspheres.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181309,International journal of pharmaceutics,2019 06 16,"The physicochemical properties and drug release characteristics of Q1/Q2 equivalent microspheres are sensitive to minor manufacturing changes, which may alter their stability under different storage-conditions. This may be undesirable due to the presence of a substantial amount of drug in microsphere products. Hence, the objective of the present work was to investigate the impact of minor manufacturing changes on the stability of Q1/Q2 equivalent microspheres under various storage conditions. Two Q1/Q2 equivalent risperidone microsphere formulations prepared with minor manufacturing changes (solvent system etc.) showed differences in their physicochemical properties (size, morphology, porosity etc.), drug release characteristics and hence, storage stability. Overall, both formulations were stable under long-term storage conditions (4 °C/ambient humidity). However, under the intermediate storage conditions (25 °C/ambient humidity), only formulation 1 was stable while formulation 2 showed significant polymer degradation, particle aggregation and alteration in the drug release characteristics. Lastly, under accelerated storage conditions (40 °C/ambient humidity vs 75% RH), the extent of polymer degradation, morphological changes and alteration of drug release characteristics of formulation 2 was significantly higher compared to that of formulation 1. Thus, minor manufacturing changes have the potential to significantly alter the storage stability and, hence, the quality and performance of complex drug products such as microspheres.",Hydrogel Microspheres Evading Alveolar Macrophages for Sustained Pulmonary Protein Delivery.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181308,International journal of pharmaceutics,2019 06 10,"Pulmonary delivery is a highly attractive alternative to injections for biologics such as therapeutic proteins. However, bioavailabilities generally suffer from the presence of phagocytic cells that clear particulate matter entering the lung. In this study, microgel particles were developed using an all-aqueous two-phase system approach and evaluated for their efficacy as an inhalable controlled release system. Norbornene- and thiol-modified four- and eight-armed poly (ethylene glycol) with an average molecular mass of 10,000 Da were prepared as macromonomers for microgel formation. Emulsions of precursor solution droplets containing macromonomers and Irgacure 2959 as photocatalyst were prepared in a dextran solution. Irradiation with UV light was used to covalently crosslink the droplets by triggering the thiol-ene reaction. The resulting microgels were processed to dry powder inhaler formulations, and respirable aerodynamic sizes were assessed in vitro. Microgels were loaded with the model proteins lysozyme and bovine serum albumin, with encapsulation efficiencies of 51.5% and 73.6%, respectively. Depending on the macromonomer type, protein-loaded microgels released their cargo over a 6 to 14 day period. In an MTT assay, the particles did not show significant cytotoxicity, and their recognition by alveolar macrophages was considerably lower than for polystyrene control particles. This makes the microgels a promising pulmonary delivery system for proteins and other biologics.",Sustained release and improved bioavailability in mice after subcutaneous administration of griseofulvin as nano- and microcrystals.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181305,International journal of pharmaceutics,2019 06 10,"The objective of the study was to evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile after different subcutaneous (s.c.) administrations of nano- and microparticle suspensions of griseofulvin to mice. The solubility of the compound was determined as approximately 40 µM, at 37°C, independent of particle size, stabilizer mixtures investigated and solvent used for measurement. The present in vivo studies demonstrated non-linear absorption kinetics (in peak concentration, Cmax) for griseofulvin up to 50 mg/kg after s.c. administration of nanocrystals and microsuspensions but linear increase in area under the curve (AUC) at all occasions investigated. Cmax was higher for smaller particles administered. Both investigated suspensions, at 10 and 50 mg/kg, showed significantly sustained plasma profiles compared to i.v. and p.o administration. Administering 10 and 50 mg/kg of griseofulvin nanocrystals as 10 mL/kg, instead of 2.5 mL/kg, improved Cmax but AUC was unchanged. The present study showed that the bioavailability of griseofulvin, administered as nano- and microparticles, increased significantly after s.c, administration (60-100%) compared with p.o dosing (17%).

Aside from their antimicrobial functions, AMPs present physicochemical and structural properties that allow them to exert activity against other kind of cells, such as cancer cells. VmCT1 is a potent cationic amphipathic AMP from the venom of the scorpion Vaejovis mexicanus. In this study, we designed lysine-substituted VmCT1 analogs for verifying the influence of changes in the net positive charge on biological activities. The increase in the net positive charge caused by lysine substitutions in the hydrophilic portion, led to higher antimicrobial activity values (0.1-6.3 μmol L-1) than VmCT1 (0.8-50 μmol L-1) and higher activity against mammary cancer cells MCF-7 (6.3-12.5 μmol L-1) than VmCT1 (12.5 μmol L-1). Contrarily, when lysine-substitutions were made at the hydrophobic portion of the helical projection, the activity values decreased. However, the lysine-substitution at the center of the hydrophobic face led to the generation of an analog with antiplasmodial activity at the same concentration presented by VmCT1 (0.8 μmol L-1). In this study, we demonstrated that it is possible to modulate biological activities and cytotoxicity of VmCT1 peptides by increasing their net positive charge using lysine residues, thus creating alternatives for standard-of-care therapeutics against different types of microorganisms and MCF-7 human breast cancer cells.",Method for Labeling and Reconstruction of Single Neurons Using Sindbis Virus Vectors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181303,Journal of chemical neuroanatomy,2019 06 10,"Neuronal dendrites and axons are key substrates for the input and output of information, respectively, so establishing the precise and complete morphological description of dendritic and axonal processes of a single neuron is essential for understanding the neuron's functional role in the neuronal circuits. The whole structure of single neurons was originally revealed using Golgi staining, and later the intracellular labeling method was developed, although this is technically too difficult to stain entire neurons in vivo. Since the late 1980s, molecular biology techniques have been applied to neuroscience research, leading to the development of various virus vectors, such as the Sindbis and adeno-associated virus vectors, which have facilitated the reconstruction of neurons at a single cell level. In the present review, we focus on a method for labeling and reconstruction of single neurons using Sindbis virus vectors that express membrane-targeted fluorescent proteins. We describe in detail a protocol for single-neuron labeling using Sindbis virus vectors, and we provide an example of a recent project at our laboratory in which we successfully applied these methods to study thalamocortical projection neurons. Further, we discuss the strengths and limitations of Sindbis virus vectors for single neuron reconstruction, comparing them with adeno-associated virus vectors.",Peripheral Versus Central Nervous System APOE in Alzheimer's Disease:Interplay across the Blood-Brain Barrier.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181302,Neuroscience letters,2019 06 10,"The apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 allele has been demonstrated as the preeminent genetic risk factor for late onset Alzheimer's disease (AD), which comprises greater than 90% of all AD cases. The discovery of the connection between different APOE genotypes and AD risk in the early 1990s spurred three decades of intense and comprehensive research into the function of APOE in the normal and diseased brain. The importance of APOE in the periphery has been well established, due to its pivotal role in maintaining cholesterol homeostasis and cardiovascular health. The influence of vascular factors on brain function and AD risk has been extensively studied in recent years. As a major apolipoprotein regulating multiple molecular pathways beyond its canonical lipid-related functions in the periphery and the central nervous system, APOE represents a critical link between the two compartments, and may influence AD risk from both perspectives. This review discusses recent advances in understanding the different functions of APOE in the periphery and in the brain, as well as highlighting several promising APOE-targeted therapeutic strategies for AD."

Toxicology & pharmacology : CBP,2019 06 10,"Thyroid hormones (THs) play an important role in early stages development of fish species. Manual elevation of THs in the embryos improves viability and hatching success. However, the impacts of endocrine disrupting chemicals on THs-treated embryos are unclear. This study investigated the effect of triiodothyronine (T3) to mitigate toxic effects of diazinon in the endangered Persian sturgeon (Acipenser persicus) eggs and embryos. Fertilized eggs were exposed to nominal concentrations of 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 mg/L diazinon and the 96 h LC50 value was calculated at 3.5 mg/L. Eggs were then treated with exogenous T3 (1 ng/mL: LT3, and 10 ng/mL: HT3) and exposed to 3.5 mg/L diazinon (DLT3 and DHT3). Total THs concentrations, levels of cortisol, and expression of the igf-II gene were measured during embryogenesis. All the measured endpoints were significantly different between treatments or stages of incubation. Generally, despite insignificant in some cases, higher levels of T3 and Thyroxin (T4) were observed in T3-treated embryos regardless of the presence of diazinon. Cortisol was high in unfertilized eggs which reduced after fertilization. The igf-II gene up-regulated quickly after fertilization; was higher in T3-treated embryos. Exposure of eggs to diazinon reduced the levels of T3, T4, and igf-II gene expression, which corresponded to the lowest hatching. We concluded that exogenous T3 improves embryos development in A. persicus, which is a promising application for conservation strategies. Our study suggests that treating embryos with 10 ng/L T3 is a suitable way to overcome problems of incubation in diazinon-polluted water sources.",The Microbial Toxin Microcin B17: Prospects for the Development of New Antibacterial Agents.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181289,Journal of molecular biology,2019 06 10,"Microcin B17 (MccB17) is an antibacterial peptide produced by strains of Escherichia coli harbouring the plasmid-borne mccB17 operon. MccB17 possesses many notable features. It is able to stabilise the transient DNA gyrase-DNA cleavage complex, a very efficient mode of action shared with the highly-successful fluoroquinolone drugs. MccB17 stabilises this complex by a distinct mechanism making it potentially valuable in the fight against bacterial antibiotic resistance. MccB17 was the first compound discovered from the Thiazole/Oxazole-Modified Microcins (TOMMs) family and the Linear Azole-containing Peptides (LAPs); these ribosomal peptides are post-translationally modified to convert serine and cysteine residues into oxazole and thiazole rings. These chemical moieties are found in many other bioactive compounds like the vitamin thiamine, the anti-cancer drug bleomycin, the antibacterial sulfathiazole and the antiviral nitazoxanide. Therefore, the biosynthetic machinery that produces these azole rings is noteworthy as a general method to create bioactive compounds. Our knowledge of MccB17 now extends to many aspects of antibacterial-bacteria interactions: production, transport, interaction with its target, resistance mechanisms; this knowledge has wide potential applicability. After a long time with limited progress on MccB17, recent publications have addressed critical aspects of MccB17 biosynthesis as well as an explosion in the discovery of new related compounds in the TOMMs/LAPs family. It is therefore timely to summarise the evidence gathered over more than 40 years about this still enigmatic molecule and place it in the wider context of antibacterials.",The Cytoplasm-Entry Domain of Antibacterial CdiA Is a Dynamic α-Helical Bundle with Disulfide-Dependent Structural Features.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181288,Journal of molecular biology,2019 06 14,"Many Gram-negative bacterial species use contact-dependent growth inhibition (CDI) systems to compete with neighboring cells. CDI+ strains express cell-surface CdiA effector proteins, which carry a toxic C-terminal region (CdiA-CT) that is cleaved from the effector upon transfer into the periplasm of target bacteria. The released CdiA-CT consists of two domains. The C-terminal domain is typically a nuclease that inhibits cell growth, and the N-terminal ""cytoplasm-entry"" domain mediates toxin translocation into the target-cell cytosol. Here, we use nuclear magnetic resonance and circular dichroism spectroscopic approaches to probe the structure, stability and dynamics of the cytoplasm-entry domain from Escherichia coli STEC_MHI813. Chemical shift analysis reveals that the CdiA-CTMHI813 entry domain is composed of a C-terminal helical bundle and a dynamic N-terminal region containing two disulfide linkages. Disruption of the disulfides by mutagenesis or chemical reduction destabilizes secondary structure over the N-terminus, but has no effect on the C-terminal helices. Though critical for N-terminal structure, the disulfides have only modest effects on global thermodynamic stability, and the entry domain exhibits characteristics of a molten globule. We find that the disulfides form in vivo as the entry domain dwells in the periplasm of inhibitor cells prior to target-cell recognition. CdiA-CTMHI813 variants lacking either disulfide still kill target bacteria, but disruption of both bonds abrogates growth inhibition activity. We propose that the entry domain's dynamic structural features are critical for function. In its molten globule-like state, the domain resists degradation after delivery, yet remains pliable enough to unfold for membrane translocation.",TWEAK/Fn14 is overexpressed in Crohn's disease and mediates experimental ileitis by regulating critical innate and adaptive immune pathways.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181286,Cellular and molecular gastroenterology and hepatology,2019 06 10,"Crohn's Disease (CD) is a debilitating inflammatory disorder that affects more than 1.6 million people in North America alone.

In this manuscript, we describe the path to approval for the first therapeutic against smallpox, identified during its development as ST-246, now known as tecovirimat and TPOXX®, a small-molecule antiviral compound sponsored by SIGA Technologies to treat symptomatic smallpox. Because the disease is no longer endemic, the development and approval of TPOXX® was only possible under the U.S. Food and Drug and Administration Animal Rule (FDA 2002).

More specifically, biological mechanisms of epileptic states and state transitions are not well understood. Here, we explore the concept of the epilepsy as a manifestation of a multistate network composed of coupled oscillatory units. We also propose that functional coupling between neuroglial elements is a dynamic process, characterized by temporal changes both at short and long time scales. We review various experimental and modelling data suggesting that epilepsy is a pathological manifestation of such a multistate network - both when viewed as a coupled oscillatory network, and as a system of multistate stable state attractors. Based on a coupled oscillators model, we propose a significant role for glial cells in modulating hyperexcitability of the neuroglial networks of the brain. Also, using these concepts, we explain a number of observable phenomena such as propagation patterns of bursts within a seizure in the isolated intact hippocampus in vitro, postictal generalized suppression in human encephalographic seizure data, and changes in seizure susceptibility in epileptic patients. Based on our conceptual model we propose potential clinical applications to estimate brain closeness to ictal transition by means of active perturbations and passive measures during on-going activity.",Neuroprotective effect of CuATSM on neurotoxin-induced motor neuron loss in an ALS mouse model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181282,Neurobiology of disease,2019 06 16,"CuATSM is a PET-imaging agent that has recently received attention for its success in extending the lifespan in animals in several neurodegenerative disease models. In the SOD1G93A model of ALS, CuATSM prolonged mouse longevity far longer than any previously tested therapeutic agents. The mechanism underlying this outcome has not been fully understood, but studies suggest that this copper complex contributes to maintaining copper homeostasis in mitochondria. More specifically for the SOD1 model, the molecule supplies copper back to the SOD1 protein. Additionally, CuATSM demonstrated similar protective effects in various in vivo Parkinson's disease mouse models. In the current pilot study, we utilized a neurodegenerative mouse model of motor neuron degeneration induced by the neurotoxin β-sitosterol β-D-glucoside. In this model, slow but distinct and progressive features of sporadic ALS occur. Treatment with CuATSM kept animal behavioural performance on par with the controls and prevented the extensive motor neuron degeneration and microglia activation seen in the untreated animals. These outcomes support a broader neuroprotective role for CuATSM beyond mutant SOD models of ALS.",Cyclophillin A deficiency accelerates RML-induced prion disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181281,Neurobiology of disease,2019 06 10,"Prion diseases typically involve brain deposition of abnormally folded prion protein, which is associated with activated glia and increased cytokine production. Cyclophilin A (CypA) is a ubiquitous protein with peptidyl prolyl cis-trans isomerase activity, which regulates protein folding, and can be secreted by cells in response to inflammatory stimuli. On the basis of in vitro studies, CypA was proposed to mediate glial activation during prion infection. To investigate the role of CypA in vivo, we inoculated CypA+/+, CypA+/- and CypA-/- mice with the RML prion strain, and recorded the time to onset of neurological signs and to terminal disease, and the astrocyte and microglia response at presymptomatic and symptomatic stages. Time to onset of disease and survival were significantly shorter in CypA-deficient mice than CypA-expressing controls. CypA-deficient mice had significantly greater microglial activation in the presymptomatic stage, and analysis of anti- and pro-inflammatory microglial markers indicated a shift towards a pro-inflammatory phenotype. There was no difference in astrocyte activation. This suggests that CypA contributes to dampening the pro-inflammatory microglial response during the early stage of RML-induced prion disease.",Influence of Chemokines on the Endothelial Permeability and Cellular Transmigration during Dengue.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181280,Immunology letters,2019 06 10,"During a pathogenic infection, an inflammatory process is triggered in which several inflammatory mediators, such as cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, complement system components, nitric oxide, and others induce integrity alteration on the endothelial barrier. Chemokines are responsible for regulating leukocyte trafficking under homeostatic conditions as well as activating immune system cells under inflammatory conditions. They are crucial molecules in the early stages of infection, leading to the recruitment of immune cells, namely neutrophils, monocytes, natural killer (NK) cells, natural killer T cells (NKT), dendritic cells (DC), T lymphocytes and all cells expressing chemokine receptors for inflammatory sites. Other functions, such as collagen production, tissue repair, a proliferation of hematopoietic precursors and angiogenesis, are also performed by these molecules. Chemokines, amongst inflammatory mediators, play a key role in dengue immunopathogenesis. Dengue fever is a disease caused by the dengue virus (DENV). It is characterized by a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations ranging from asymptomatic cases to mild and severe symptomatic ones. As for the latter, the appearance of hemorrhagic manifestations and changes in vascular permeability may lead the patient to develop cavitary effusions, organ involvement, and even death. As chemokines exert an influence on various homeostatic and inflammatory processes, acting vigorously on vascular endothelial activation and cell migration, the main purpose of this chapter is to discuss the influence of chemokines on the alteration of endothelial permeability and migration of T lymphocytes in DENV infection."

The underlying nature of autoimmune diseases has led to speculation that the risk of malignancy might be higher or lower in patients with such diseases. However, the rarity and heterogeneity of both autoimmune diseases and malignancies is the main challenge for systematic exploration of associations between autoimmune diseases and cancer. The nationwide usages of electronic health records in Sweden and other countries has created longitudinal clinical datasets of large populations, which are ideal for quantifying the associations as well as possible guidance concerning the underlying mechanisms. In this report, we firstly summarize the population-based epidemiological association studies between autoimmune diseases and subsequent hematological malignancies using data derived mainly from Swedish nationwide data. These include over one million cancer cases and approximately 500,000 patients with medically diagnosed autoimmune disease. We further discuss the underlying mechanisms that contribute to the observed association between autoimmune diseases and hematological malignancies, including shared genetics, environmental factors, medical treatments of autoimmune diseases as well as dysregulated immune function.",Antibody Therapeutics and Immunoregulation in Cancer and Autoimmune Disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181267,Seminars in cancer biology,2019 06 10,"Cancer and autoimmune disease are closely related, and many therapeutic antibodies are widely used in clinics for the treatment of both diseases. Among them, the anti-CD20 antibody has proven to be effective against both lymphoid malignancy and autoimmune disease. Moreover, immune checkpoint blockade using the anti-PD1/PD-L1/CTLA4 antibody has improved the prognosis of patients with refractory solid tumors. At the same time, however, over-enhancement of immunoreaction can induce autoimmune reaction. Although anti-TNF antibody therapies represent a breakthrough in the treatment of autoimmune diseases, optimal management is required to control the serious associated issues, including development and progression of cancer, and it is becoming more and more important to control the immunoreaction. In addition, next-generation antibody therapeutics such as antibody-drug conjugates and bispecific antibodies, are anticipated to treat uncontrolled cancer and autoimmune disease. IL-7R signaling plays an important role in the development and progression of both lymphoid malignancy and autoimmune disease. In addition, abnormal homing activity and steroid resistance caused by IL-7R signaling may worsen prognosis. Therefore, anti-IL-7R targeting antibody therapies that enable suppression of such pathophysiological status have the potential to be beneficial for the treatment of both diseases. In this review, we discuss current antibody therapeutics in cancer and autoimmune disease, and describe a new therapeutic strategy for immunoregulation including IL-7R targeting antibodies.",On the behavioral economics of medication choice: A research story.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181266,Behavioural processes,2019 06 10,"Behavioral economics has been consistently useful in describing a wide range of clinical phenomena, particularly in reference to behavioral excesses such as substance abuse, problematic gambling and obesity/overeating. Given an opportunity to explore these processes as they relate to treatment adherence in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), our central thesis was that behavioral economic tools/processes that have been helpful in other areas of application (e.g., substance abuse, obesity) could be leveraged to help understand treatment non-adherence and hopefully lead to efforts to combat it. The current paper tells a story of how an interdisciplinary set of researchers came to combine their separate expertise in MS and behavioral economics to yield novel insights into the failures of treatment adherence often experienced in this clinical population.",Phorid parasitoid attack triggers specific defensive behaviours and collaborative responses in leaf-cutting ants.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181265,Behavioural processes,2019 06 16,"Being social adds another level of defence for organisms: social defences. Beside individual defensive behaviours, social organisms can limit parasite infections by using collective and collaborative behaviours. We evaluated whether the social defence of the leaf-cutting ant Atta cephalotes is specific against phorid parasitoids and the occurrence of collaborative responses depends on the context, i.e. ant activity in foraging trails and number of phorid attacks. We exposed workers to freshly dead specimens of phorids, non-phorid flies or a control without flies in different ant flux conditions and number of attacks and evaluated ant response. We found that workers responded more frequently to phorids than to non-phorid flies and controls suggesting that specific chemical or visual cues of phorids are recognized by leaf-cutting ants triggering a behavioural response. Although the probability of collaborative defences was similar in different ant flux conditions and number of attacks, they occurred more frequently when ants were attacked by a phorid than when they were attacked by the other treatments. Therefore, we demonstrated that leaf-cutting ants differentiate parasitoid flies from other flies, showing a collaborative response against them, in contrast to the other flies and the control, for which almost no collaborative responses were displayed.",Alum as an adjuvant for nanoparticle based vaccines: A case study with a hybrid nanoparticle-based nicotine vaccine.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181264,"Nanomedicine : nanotechnology, biology, and medicine",2019 06 10,"The treatment efficacy of a nicotine vaccine largely relies on its ability to induce high titers of nicotine-specific antibodies.

In this study, we attempted to improve the immunological performance of a hybrid nanoparticle-based nicotine vaccine (NanoNicVac) by co-administering it with Alum. It was found that Alum severely restricted the release of NanoNicVac at the site of injection. Moreover, Alum damaged the hybrid structure of the vaccine. In the animal trial, mice immunized with NanoNicVac alone achieved an anti-nicotine IgG titer of 3.5±0.2×104 after three injections. Unexpectedly, Alum with quantities of 125, 250, 500, and 1000μg did not enhance the immunogenicity of NanoNicVac.

However, the rapid degradation of Mg alloys and loss of their mechanical integrity before sufficient bone healing impede their clinical application. Our literature review shows that magnesium matrix nanocomposites (MMNCs) reinforced with nanoparticles possess enhanced strength, high corrosion resistance, and good biocompatibility. This article provides a detailed analysis of the effects of nanoparticle reinforcements on the mechanical properties, corrosion behavior, and biocompatibility of MMNCs as promising biodegradable implant materials. The governing equations to quantitatively predict the mechanical properties and underlying synergistic strengthening mechanisms in MMNCs are elucidated. The potential, recent advances, challenges and future research directions in relation to nanoparticles reinforced MMNCs are highlighted.

The attraction largely is due to Mg's biodegradability and ability to enhance bone healing and formation. However, the underlying mechanism of how Mg regulates osteogenesis is still unclear. Based on our previous in vivo and molecular signaling work demonstrating the osteogenic effect of Mg, the current study aims to extend this work at the molecular level especially that we also observed and quantified mineral deposits in the bone marrow space in a rabbit ulna fracture model with Mg plates and screws. Histological analysis and quantitative results of micro-CT showed mineralized deposition and a significant increase in bone volume at 8 weeks and 16 weeks post-operative. These in vivo results led us to focus on studying the effect of Mg2+ on human bone marrow stromal cells (hBMSCs). The data presented in this manuscript demonstrate the activation of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway in hBMSCs when treated with 10 mM Mg2+. With additional Mg2+ present, the protein expression of active β-catenin was significantly increased to a level similar to that of the positive control. Immunocytochemistry and the increased expression of LEF1 and Dkk1, downstream target genes that are controlled directly by active β-catenin, demonstrated the protein translocation and the activation of transcription. Taken together, these data suggest that Mg2+ induces an osteogenic effect in the bone marrow space by activating the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, which in turn causes BMSCs to differentiate toward the osteoblast lineage.",Thiazide Diuretics and Risk of Knee Replacement Surgery among Patients with Knee Osteoarthritis: A General Population-based Cohort Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181261,Osteoarthritis and cartilage,2019 06 10,"Thiazide diuretic use is associated with higher bone mineral density (BMD) and possibly lower serum magnesium levels than loop diuretic use, and both high BMD and low serum magnesium have been linked to high prevalent knee osteoarthritis.

The working electrode was constructed via the layer-by-layer (LBL) method with the Ho3+/Yb3+-TiO2, CdSe QDs, NHS/EDC, antibody of VP (anti-VP), bovine serum albumin (BSA) modified on the surface of the FTO in sequence. Ascorbic acid (AA) acts as an electron donor to combine photogenerated holes in order to provide a stable current system. Ho3+ and Yb3+ co-doping TiO2 broadened the spectral response range of TiO2 to the infrared region and improved the photocurrent responsiveness of TiO2. The PEC immunosensor, with Ho3+/Yb3+ ratio of 1:5, Ho3+/Yb3+-TiO2 of 2 mg/mL and PBS solution of pH 7.4, had an optimal photocurrent responsiveness. Immobilization of anti-VP was by classical NHS/EDC coupling reactions between -COOH groups of CdSe QDs and -NH2 groups of the anti-VP. The results indicated that PEC immunosensors had a low detection limit of 25 CFU/mL, a wide detection range of 102-108 CFU/mL, high stability, low price, and short detection time. This method could be promising for the rapid and ultrasensitive detection of pathogenic microorganisms in the food."

In this respect, a prominent example is Hsp70, a chaperone protein whose synthesis is dynamically regulated in stress conditions. In this paper, we expand a formal model of Hsp70 heat induction originally proposed in previous articles. To accurately capture various modes of heat shock effects, we not only introduce temperature dependencies in transcription to Hsp70 mRNA and in dissociation of transcriptional complexes, but we also derive a new formal expression for the temperature dependence in protein denaturation. We calibrate our model using comprehensive sets of both previously published experimental data and also biologically justified constraints. Interestingly, we obtain a biologically plausible temperature dependence of the transcriptional complex dissociation, despite the lack of biological constraints imposed in the calibration process. Finally, based on a sensitivity analysis of the model carried out in both deterministic and stochastic settings, we suggest that the regulation of the binding of transcriptional complexes plays a key role in Hsp70 induction upon heat shock. In conclusion, we provide a model that is able to capture the essential dynamics of the Hsp70 heat induction whilst being biologically sound in terms of temperature dependencies, description of protein denaturation and imposed calibration constraints.",The role of network structure and time delay in a metapopulation Wilson--Cowan model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181240,Journal of theoretical biology,2019 06 16,"We study the dynamics of a network Wilson--Cowan model (a system of connected Wilson--Cowan oscillators) for interacting excitatory and inhibitory neuron populations with time delays. Each node in this model corresponds to a population of neurons, including excitatory and inhibitory subpopulations, and hence it can be viewed as a metapopulation model. It is known that information transfer within each cortical area is not instantaneous, and therefore we consider a system of delay differential equations with two different kinds of discrete delays. We account for the time delay in information propagation between individual excitatory and inhibitory subpopulations at each node via intra-node time delays, and we account for time delay in information propagation between neuron populations at different nodes with inter-node time delays. The biologically relevant resting state solutions are oscillatory (stable limit cycles). After determining the influence of the coupling parameters between nodes, the intra-node delays, and the inter-node delays on the dynamics of the two coupled Wilson--Cowan oscillators, we then explore a variety of larger networks of 16 and 100 nodes, in order to determine how the network topology will influence time delayed Wilson--Cowan dynamics. We find that network structure can regularize or deregularize the dynamics, with networks of higher mean degree permitting stable limit cycles and networks with smaller mean degree yielding less regular dynamics (which may range from chaotic solutions, to solutions for which limit cycles collapse into steady states, which are biologically undesirable compared with the preferred stable limit cycles). Furthermore, heterogeneity in the degree distribution of the network (resulting from networks with nodes of varying degree) can result in asynchronous dynamics, even if at each node the local dynamics are that of a limit cycle, in contrast to the synchronization of dynamics between nodes seen when the degree of all nodes is equal. This suggests that homogeneous and well-connected networks permit robust limit cycles under time-delayed Wilson--Cowan dynamics, whereas heterogeneous or poorly connected networks may fail to provide such desirable dynamics, a phenomena akin to structural loss of neuron connections in neurodegenerative diseases.",Anti-diabetic effect of oligosaccharides from seaweed Sargassum confusum via JNK-IRS1/PI3K signalling pathways and regulation of gut microbiota.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181236,Food and chemical toxicology : an international journal published for the British Industrial Biological Research Association,2019 06 16,"Brown seaweed Sargassum confusum (C. Agardh) has been used in traditional Chinese medicine to treat a variety of diseases. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the anti-diabetic effect of oligosaccharides from brown seaweed S. confusum (SCO). The anti-diabetic effect of SCO was evaluated in vivo using high-fat/high-sucrose fed hamsters. Molecular mechanisms of modulating gene expression of specific members of insulin signaling pathways were determined. The components of the intestinal microflora in diabetic animals were also analyzed by high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing. And it was found that SCO had a sequence of sulfated anhydrogalactose and methyl sulfated galactoside units. Fasting blood glucose levels were significantly decreased after SCO administration. Histology showed that SCO could protect the cellular architecture of the liver. SCO could also significantly increase the relative abundance of Lactobacillus and Clostridium XIVa and decrease that of Allobaculum, Bacteroides and Clostridium IV. The active role of SCO in anti-diabetic effect was revealed by its regulation of insulin receptor substrate 1/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and c-Jun N-terminal kinase pathways.

Here, we present an isothermal strategy named rolling circle reverse transcription-mediated RNA amplification (RCRT-MRA) to amplify small RNAs with accurate length and sequence. The target RNA and complementary DNA were circularized to serve as amplicons replicated via the rolling circle mechanism. The transcription product consisting of tandemly repeated RNA units, was monomerized by site-specific cleavage to generate amplified RNA with authentic length and sequence. T4 DNA ligase was chosen to circularize RNA template for its high efficiency and low cost. SuperScript IV reverse transcriptase was found to be able to catalyze the RCRT reaction on the circular RNA template, and the reaction efficiency was enhanced by adding the nicking enzyme, Nb.BbvCI to the RCRT system. E. Coli RNA polymerase, instead of the commonly used T7 RNA polymerase, was applied to synthesize long-strand RNA product for its high universality and processivity. Under the optimized conditions, small RNAs can be precisely amplified by 105∼6 folds. The fidelity of the established method was demonstrated by the accordance of the sequencing result and the initial RNA sequences. Free from expensive thermal cycler (necessary for RT-PCR-based amplification), precise replication of the initial RNA and high fidelity will enable the established strategy to be applied in RNA-seq, mRNA profiling, microarray analysis and RNA-based SELEX as well.",Mammalian legumain - a lysosomal cysteine protease with extracellular functions?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181234,Biochimie,2019 06 10,"The cysteine protease legumain (asparaginyl endopeptidase, AEP) plays important roles in normal physiology but is also associated with several disorders, such as atherosclerosis, osteoporosis, cancer and neurodegenerative diseases.

Among PAHs, phenanthrene and anthracene are isomers consisting of three benzene rings. In the present study, we have made comparisons of constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) activation and toxic effects on the liver between these two isomers. Phenanthrene, but not anthracene, significantly induced promoter activity and gene expression of human drug metabolizing enzyme CYP2B6 in HepG2 cells and human primary hepatocytes, respectively. Phenanthrene, but not anthracene, significantly increased CYP2B10 expression levels and caused hepatotoxicity in mice. Phenanthrene induced the nuclear accumulation of CAR in the liver of wild-type mice, but not CAR-/- mice. Hepatocellular necrosis, elevated expression levels of some CAR-related genes such as CYP2B10, CYP3A11, UGT1A1, SULT2A1 and GSTM3, and lower hepatic glutathione levels were found in phenanthrene-exposed wild-type mice but not CAR-/- mice. Additionally, phenanthrene and anthracene were detected in both raw and grilled lamb samples. The average concentrations of phenanthrene were much higher than those of anthracene in these samples. This study is the first to demonstrate that phenanthrene, but not its isomer anthracene, effectively activates both human and mouse nuclear receptor CAR, and CAR plays a crucial role in phenanthrene-induced mouse hepatotoxicity. Compared with anthracene, K region may be an important electronic structure of phenanthrene for activation of CAR.

Details of what precisely triggers these responses as well as the sequence of events leading up to these responses are not clear. We review the musculoskeletal effects of burn injury to determine the precise contributions of this system in the generation and sustenance of this post-burn triad as well as the possible effects of pharmacologic intervention in the musculoskeletal response to burns on the resulting hypermetabolism. Inflammation-associated bone resorption liberates calcium, which may either prolong or intensify the systemic inflammatory response. Phosphate and magnesium liberated from bone could contribute to sustaining the increased ATP turnover in skeletal muscle that accompanies burn hypermetabolism. Reduced bone formation resulting from both pro-inflammatory cytokines and elevated endogenous glucocorticoid production results in reduced bone mass and therefore reduced osteocalcin production, which may contribute to reduced glucose uptake by skeletal muscle. Moreover, bone resorption liberates muscle catabolic factors such as transforming growth factor β, which contribute to the muscle wasting of burn hypermetabolism. Pharmacologic intervention with anti-resorptive agents early in the process preserve bone and muscle mass post-burn and future research should address the consequences for the hypermetabolic triad duration and intensity accompanying burn injury.",PPP1R3C mediates metformin-inhibited hepatic gluconeogenesis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181215,Metabolism: clinical and experimental,2019 06 10,"Metformin has been widely used to alleviate hyperglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes mainly via suppressing hepatic gluconeogenesis.

The biological substrate for frailty is sarcopenia, which is potentiated by chronic inflammation and depletion or impairment of endogenous precursor and stem cells. Current interventions focus on interdisciplinary approaches which include nutritional supplementation, physical exercise, and cognitive intervention. Clinical studies of these preventative approaches have shown inconsistent and modest benefits, further highlighting the unmet clinical need. A variety of pharmacologic and biologic therapies are currently being tested to treat aging. Cell-based therapy represents an attractive option that addresses the pathophysiology of the syndrome. Human allogeneic mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) which possess immunomodulatory and tissue reparative properties, have been tested in Phase I and Phase II trials. These small early stage studies reveal that allogeneic MSCs administered to frail older adults are feasible to administer, safe and potentially efficacious, ameliorating signs and symptoms of frailty.

While the need for standardization in sample processing and data analysis is well-recognized, the impact of sample handling in the pre-analytical phase remains underestimated. We evaluated the impact of sample storage time (≈transport time) and temperature, type of anticoagulant, and limited blood volume on reproducibility of flow cytometric studies. EDTA and Na-Heparin samples processed with the EuroFlow bulk lysis protocol, stained and stored at 4 °C showed fairly stable expression of cell surface markers and distribution of the major leukocyte populations for up to 72 h. Additional sample fixation (1% PFA, Fix & Perm) did not have any beneficial effects. Blood samples stored for <24 h at room temperature before processing and staining seemed suitable for reliable immunophenotyping, although losses in absolute cell numbers were observed. The major losses were observed in myeloid cells and monocytes, while lymphocytes seemed less affected. Expression of cell surface markers and population distribution were more stable in Na-Heparin blood than in EDTA blood. However, storage of Na-Heparin samples was associated with faster decrease in leukocyte counts over time. Whole blood fixation strategies (Cyto-Chex, TransFix) improved long-term population distribution, but were detrimental for expression of cellular markers. The main conclusions from this study on healthy donor blood samples were successfully confirmed in EDTA clinical (patient) blood samples with different time delays until processing. Finally, we recognized the need for adjustments in bulk lysis in case of insufficient blood volumes. Despite clear overall conclusions, individual markers and cell populations had different preferred conditions. Therefore, specific guidelines for sample handling should always be adjusted to the clinical application and the main target leukocyte population.",Fluorochrome choices for multi-color flow cytometry.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181212,Journal of immunological methods,2019 06 10,"Fluorochrome selection is a key step in designing multi-color antibody panels. The list of available fluorochromes is continuously growing, fitting current needs in clinical flow cytometry to simultaneously use more markers to better define multiple leukocyte subpopulations in a single tube. Several criteria guide fluorochrome selection: i) the fluorescence profiles (excitation and emission), ii) relative brightness, iii) fluorescence overlap, iv) fluorochrome stability, and v) reproducible conjugation to antibodies. Here we used 75 samples (45 bone marrow and 30 blood) to illustrate EuroFlow strategies for evaluation of compatible fluorochromes, and how the results obtained guide fluorochrome selection as a critical step in the antibody-panel building process. Our results allowed identification of optimal fluorescence profiles (e.g. higher fluorescence intensity and/or resolution with limited fluorescence overlap into neighbor channels) for brilliant violet (BV)421 and BV510 in the violet laser and allophycocyanin (APC) hilite 7 (H7) or APC C750 in the red laser vs. other candidate fluorochromes generally applied for the same detectors and here evaluated. Moreover, evaluation of the same characteristics for another group of fluorochromes (e.g. BV605, BV650, PE CF594, AF700 or APC AF700) guided selection of the most appropriate fluorochrome conjugates to be combined in a multi-color antibody panel. Albeit this is a demanding approach, it could be successfully applied for selection of fluorochrome combinations for the EuroFlow antibody panels for diagnosis, classification and monitoring of hematological malignancies and primary immunodeficiencies. Consequently, sets of 8-, 10- and 12-color fluorochrome combinations are proposed as frame of reference for initial antibody panel design.",Optimisation of multiplex immunofluorescence for a non-spectral fluorescence scanning system.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181211,Journal of immunological methods,2019 06 16,"The use of multi-colour immunofluorescence (IF) for immunophenotyping in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections is gaining popularity worldwide. This technique allows for the simultaneous detection of multiple markers on the same tissue section, thereby yielding more complex information than is possible by chromogenic immunohistochemistry (IHC). However, many commercially-available multiplex IF kits are designed for use in conjunction with a multispectral imaging system, to which many research groups have limited access. Here we present two 5-colour IF panels designed for T cell characterisation in human colorectal tissue, which can be imaged using a non-spectral fluorescence slide scanner with standard band-pass filters. We describe the optimisation process and the key considerations in developing a multiplex fluorescence assay, and discuss some of the advantages and disadvantages of using multiplex IF with a non-spectral imaging system.",Fluoxetine selectively induces p53-independent apoptosis in human colorectal cancer cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181210,European journal of pharmacology,2019 06 16,"Fluoxetine has been shown to induce anti-tumour activity. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of fluoxetine on HCT116+/+ and p53 gene-depleted HCT116-/- human colorectal cancer cells and the mechanisms, including potential p53-dependence, of its action. Fluoxetine-induced apoptosis was investigated by mitochondrial membrane potential assay, Annexin V assay, two-step cell cycle analysis using NC-3000™ system and pharmacological inhibition assays. Fluoxetine induced very selectively concentration-dependent apoptosis in human colorectal cancer cells by altering mitochondrial membrane potential and inducing translocation of phosphatidylserine to the outer membrane layer. Further evidence of the preponderance of apoptosis in fluoxetine-induced cell death is provided by the finding that the cell death was not blocked by inhibitors of parthanatos, a form of cell death that results from overactivation of the enzyme poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) but is different from apoptosis. Data obtained indicate fluoxetine caused cell cycle event at Sub-G1 and G0/G1 phases in both cell lines. In terms of apoptosis, there is no significant difference between the responses of the two cell lines to fluoxetine. In conclusion, fluoxetine's cytotoxicity induces mainly apoptosis and causes DNA fragmentation in human colorectal cancer cells, which seemed to be independent of the p53 protein, as no significant difference in death profiles in response to fluoxetine treatment was observed in both the p53-intact and the p53-deleted cell lines. Fluoxetine, therefore, has potential for being repurposed as a drug for the treatment of colon cancer and thus deserves further investigations in this context.",IMM-H007 improves heart function via reducing cardiac fibrosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181209,European journal of pharmacology,2019 06 16,"Cardiac dysfunction is a pathological state characterized by damaged ability of the left ventricle (LV) to either eject or fill blood accompanied by cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis. IMM-H007, an adenosine derivative, is an activator of AMP-Activated Protein Kinase (AMPK). AMPK can decrease the transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) expression during fibrosis. Therefore, we hypothesized that IMM-H007 contributed to cardiac dysfunction by mediating cardiac fibrosis. To test this hypothesis, we used angiotensin II (AngII)-induced cardiac remodeling model treated with IMM-H007 or vehicle. Echocardiography measurements showed that IMM-H007 significantly improved heart function indicated by increased LV ejection fraction (%LVEF) and LV fractional shortening (%LVFS). Histological staining and qRT-PCR analysis revealed that IMM-H007 markedly reduced AngII-induced cardiac fibroblast activation (α-smooth muscle actin and periostin) and matrix protein production (Collagen I and Collagen III). However, IMM-H007 did not affect AngII-induced cardiac hypertrophy. Immunoblotting analysis revealed that IMM-H007 activated AMPK, decreased the expression of TGF-β1, and inhibited the activation of Smad2 in heart tissues. In mouse primary cultured cardiac fibroblasts, pharmacological activation of AMPK by IMM-H007 significantly reduced AngII-induced TGF-β1 expression as well. Consistently, in human cardiac fibroblasts-adult ventricular (HCF-av), IMM-H007 activated AMPK and markedly suppressed AngII-induced TGF-β1 expression. These results together reveal that IMM-H007 improves heart function, and alleviates AngII-induced cardiac fibrosis by regulating AMPK-TGF-β1 signaling. These findings suggest IMM-H007 as a potential drug for treating cardiac dysfunction.",Blockade of spinal α5-GABAA receptors differentially reduces reserpine-induced fibromyalgia-type pain in female rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181208,European journal of pharmacology,2019 06 10,"The role of spinal α5 subunit-containing GABAA (α5-GABAA) receptors in chronic pain is controversial. The purpose of this study was to investigate the participation of spinal α5-GABAA receptors in the reserpine-induced pain model. Reserpine administration induced tactile allodynia and muscle hyperalgesia in female and male rats. Intrathecal injection of L-655,708 and TB 21007 (7 days after the last reserpine injection) decreased tactile allodynia and, at a lesser extent, muscle hyperalgesia in female rats. The effects of these drugs produced a lower antiallodynic and antihyperalgesic effect in male than in female rats. Contrariwise, these drugs produced tactile allodynia and muscle hyperalgesia in naïve rats and these effects were lower in naïve male than female rats. Intrathecal L-838,417 prevented or reversed L-655,708-induced antiallodynia in reserpine-treated female rats. Repeated treatment with α5-GABAA receptor small interfering RNA (siRNA), but not scramble, siRNA reduced reserpine-induced allodynia in female rats. Accordingly, α5-GABAA receptor siRNA induced nociceptive hypersensitivity in naïve female rats. Reserpine enhanced α5-GABAA receptors expression in spinal cord and DRG, while it increased CD11b (OX-42) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) fluorescence intensity in the lumbar spinal cord. In contrast, reserpine diminished K+-Cl- co-transporter 2 (KCC2) protein in the lumbar spinal cord. Data suggest that spinal α5-GABAA receptors play a sex-dependent proallodynic effect in reserpine-treated rats. In contrast, these receptors have a sex-dependent antiallodynic role in naïve rats."

Cytokines are known to induce neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) formation via free radicals generation. Hyper-activation of neutrophil leads to the increased NETs formation or ineffective clearance of NETs would likely increase the risk of auto-antibody generation against NETs components and being partly responsible for the sepsis severity and organ dysfunction. The present study was undertaken to further assess the status of NETs formation and their correlation with severity of sepsis, with the cytokines and organ dysfunction.",A homozygous ABCB4 mutation causing an LPAC syndrome evolves into cholangiocarcinoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181191,Clinica chimica acta; international journal of clinical chemistry,2019 06 16,"Low phospholipid-associated cholelithiasis (LPAC) is characterized by the association of ABCB4 mutations and low biliary phospholipid concentration with symptomatic and recurring cholelithiasis. In the present study, we reported a case of a 63-year-old woman, who presented a biliary pain beginning at the age of 30, recurrent after cholecystectomy, along with ""comet-tail shadows"" revealed by ultrasonography thus, fulfilling the diagnosis of LPAC. This disease evolved into a cholangiocarcinoma. To understand the molecular basis of this phenotype, we performed the ABCB4 gene sequencing, followed by in silico analysis and Q-RT-PCR assay. The results displayed a homozygous missense sequence variation (c.140G > A, p.Arg47Gln), predicted as pathogenic according to MutPred. Accordingly, this gave rise to a decreased hepatic ABCB4 mRNA level and structural alterations of the mutated protein. Eventually, we reported, here, the first description of an ABCB4 missense mutation (p.Arg47Gln) at homozygous state in a Tunisian LPAC syndrome. An elucidation of its functional consequences was performed. Besides, this case suggests that the delayed diagnosis of LPAC syndrome and the lack of UDCA treatment may contribute in the development of complications, such as cholangiocarcinoma.","Molecular characterization of six widespread avian haemoproteids, with description of three new Haemoproteus species.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181190,Acta tropica,2019 06 15,"Species of Haemoproteus (Haemosporida, Haemoproteidae) are widespread and often prevalent blood parasites of birds all over the word. They are particularly diverse in tropical countries. Due to limited knowledge of life cycles, these pathogens usually have been considered relatively benign and were neglected in veterinary medicine and bird management. However, recent molecular studies provided evidence that Haemoproteus parasites might cause severe diseases if they infect non-adapted (wrong) avian hosts due to marked damage of organs by exo-erythrocytic stages (megalomeronts). Additionally, high Haemoproteus infections are lethal to blood-sucking insects. Molecular markers are essential for reliable detection and species identification both at tissue stages in vertebrates and sporogonic stages in arthropods however, remain insufficiently developed for wildlife haemosporidian parasites. This study combined PCR-based and microscopic approaches and reported cytochrome b gene (cytb) and apicoplast gene (clpc) markers for characterization of six widespread species of haemoproteids parasitizing common birds wintering in tropics and subtropics of the Old World. Three new Haemoproteus species were described using morphological and molecular markers. Molecular characterization of haemoproteids parasitizing falcons was developed. Morphological and phylogenetic characterization of Haemoproteus tinnunculi (cytb lineage hFALSUB01), H. brachiatus (hLK03), H. parabelopolskyi (hSYAT1), H. homogeneae n. sp. (hSYAT16), H. homopicae n. sp. (hGAGLA07) and H. homominutus n. sp. (hCUKI1) was performed and provides clues for infections diagnostics. This study adds three species to the group of morphologically readily distinct Haemoproteus parasites, which differ in few base pairs (< 1%) in their partial cytb sequences, indicating that low genetic difference in such sequences often show between-species divergence and should be carefully applied in taxonomic biodiversity studies of haemosporidian parasites. Bayesian phylogenetic analysis identified the position of detected lineages in regard of other Haemoproteus species, suggesting that all reported parasites belong to subgenus Parahaemoproteus and likely are transmitted by Culicoides biting midges. Importance of clpc gene sequences was specified in haemosporidian parasite taxonomy on species levels.",Cryptococcosis in the Amazon: A current overview and future perspectives.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181189,Acta tropica,2019 06 10,"The Amazon region or regional Amazon complex includes nine states of Brazil with an area of around 5.1 million km, which is almost 60% of the country's territory. The sanitary conditions in this region are reflected by illness resulting from substandard living conditions and limited access to prevention measures and health care, in addition to the epidemiological profile of cryptococcosis. This article aims to provide a comprehensive review of the literature on cryptococcosis in the Amazon region and its future prospects. Thus, the present study searched the Scientific Electronic Library Online, Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature, Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System, Virtual Health Library, PubMed, and CAPES Periodical Portal for studies on cryptococcosis in the Amazon region, with an established search period of 1999 to 2018, using the search terms ""Cryptococcus,"" ""cryptococcosis,"" and ""Amazon"" with the Boolean operator AND. Out of 275 articles found, 29 were selected according to the inclusion criteria and were categorized into clinical and environmental studies. Analysis of these studies verified the increased occurrence of infection by Cryptococcus gattii at younger ages in the supposedly immunocompetent and the predominance of C. neoformans in HIV-positive patients. No occurrence of Cryptococcus laurentii infection has been identified in the literature. The regional endemic molecular types included VNI, VNII, and VGII. Similarly, the strain sequence type (ST) allelic profiles, including ST5, 7, 20, and 264-268, were identified in C. gattii isolated in Amazonas state. VNI isolates are a genetically monotypic group, with ST93 being highly important in HIV individuals. In urban environments, cryptococcosis agents were isolated in samples collected fromtrees, wooden houses, and dove excrement. Due to the absence of a control program and specific epidemiological surveillance for the primary disease, cryptococcal meningitis has become a failure parameter in the treatment of HIV/AIDS patients. The findings of the present study underscore the need for programs to track cryptococcal antigens and identify high-risk populations in order to reduce the morbimortality of this disease.","Antidepressants and nose-to-brain delivery: drivers, restraints, opportunities and challenges.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181188,Drug discovery today,2019 06 10,"Why is nose-to-brain delivery considered to be a strategy that directly allows the access of antidepressants to the brain?

Herein, we investigated the effect of pelargonidin on cellular transformation in mouse skin epidermal JB6 (JB6 P+) cells induced by tumor promoter 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). Pelargonidin treatment significantly decreased colony formation and suppressed cell viability of JB6 P+ cells. Pelargonidin also induced the anti-oxidant response element (ARE)-luciferase activation in HepG2-C8 cells overexpressing the ARE-luciferase reporter. Knockdown of nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) in shNrf2 JB6 P+ cells enhanced TPA-induced colony formation and attenuated pelargonidin's blocking effect. Pelargonidin reduced the protein levels of genes encoding methyltransferases (DNMTs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs). Importantly, pelargonidin decreased the DNA methylation in the Nrf2 promoter region of JB6 P+ cells and increased Nrf2 downstream target genes expression, such as NAD(P)H/quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), involved in cellular protection. In summary, our results showed that pelargonidin blocks TPA-induced cell transformation. The possible molecular mechanisms of its potential anti-cancer effects against neoplastic transformation may be attributed to its activation of Nrf2-ARE signaling pathway and its cytoprotective effect.",Randomized Controlled Trial of Motivational Interviewing to Support Breastfeeding Among Appalachian Women.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181186,"Journal of obstetric, gynecologic, and neonatal nursing : JOGNN",2019 06 10,To determine the effectiveness of a single session of prenatal motivational interviewing (MI) to enhance breastfeeding outcomes.,The pathogenic MT-ATP6 m.8851T>C mutation prevents proton movements within the n-side hydrophilic cleft of the membrane domain of ATP synthase.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181185,Biochimica et biophysica acta. Bioenergetics,2019 06 10,"Dozens of pathogenic mutations have been localized in the mitochondrial gene (MT-ATP6) that encodes the subunit a of ATP synthase. The subunit a together with a ring of identical subunits c moves protons across the mitochondrial inner membrane coupled to rotation of the subunit c-ring and ATP synthesis. One of these mutations, m.8851T>C, has been associated with bilateral striatal lesions of childhood (BSLC), a group of rare neurological disorders characterized by symmetric degeneration of the corpus striatum. It converts a highly conserved tryptophan residue into arginine at position 109 of subunit a (aW109R). We previously showed that an equivalent thereof in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (aW126R) severely impairs by an unknown mechanism the functioning of ATP synthase without any visible assembly/stability defect. Herein we show that ATP synthase function was recovered to varying degree by replacing the mutant arginine residue 126 with methionine, lysine or glycine or by replacing with methionine an arginine residue present in position 169 of subunit a (aR169). In recently described atomic structures of yeast ATP synthase, aR169 is at the center of a hydrophilic cleft along which protons are transported from the subunit c-ring to the mitochondrial matrix, in the proximity of the two residues known from a long time to be essential to the activity of FO (aR176 and cE59). We provide evidence that the aW126R change is responsible for an electrostatic and steric hindrance that enables aR169 to engage in a salt bridge with cE59. As a result, aR176 cannot interact properly with cE59 and ATP synthase fails to effectively move protons across the mitochondrial membrane. In addition to insight into the pathogenic mechanism induced by the m.8851T>C mutation, the present study brings interesting information on the role of specific residues of subunit a in the energy-transducing activity of ATP synthase.",Comparing dopaminergic dynamics in the dorsolateral striatum between adolescent and adult rats: Effect of an acute dose of WIN55212-2.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181184,Brain research,2019 06 10,"During adolescence dopaminergic neurotransmission shows transient changes until reaching adulthood. The administration of CB1 agonists such as WIN55212-2 during adulthood increases dopamine extracellular levels. However, the effects of acute administration of cannabinoids on nigrostriatal dopamine neurotransmission during adolescence are not fully elucidated. The aim of this research is to compare dorsolateral striatum (DLS) dopamine (DA) dynamics and to study the effect of WIN55212-2 on DLS DA dynamics during adolescence and adulthood. No-net flux microdialysis experiments were carried out in adolescent (post-natal day 35-40) and young-adult (post-natal day 70-75) urethane-anesthetized rats. Basal DA dialysate, DA extraction fraction (Ed) and extracellular concentration of DA (Cext) in DLS were assessed after an acute injection of WIN55212-2 (1.2 mg/kg) or vehicle. An increased basal DA dialysate and DA Ed were observed during adolescence compared to adulthood. Moreover, WIN55212-2 increases DLS DA Cext rising basal DA dialysate in adulthood and decreasing DA Ed in adolescence. Our results suggest that an age-dependent mechanism underlies the effect of WIN 55212-2 on DA balance between release and uptake in DLS.",The intrinsic and regulated proteomes of barley seeds in response to fungal infection.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181183,Analytical biochemistry,2019 06 15,"Barley is an important cereal grain used for beer brewing, animal feed, and human food consumption. Fungal disease can impact barley production, as it causes substantial yield loss and lowers seed quality. We used sequential window acquisition of all theoretical ions mass spectrometry (SWATH-MS) to measure and quantify the relative abundance of proteins within seeds of different barley varieties under various fungal pathogen burdens (ProteomeXchange Datasets PXD011303 and PXD014093). Fungal burden in the leaves and stems of barley resulted in changes to the seed proteome. However, these changes were minimal and showed substantial variation among barley samples infected with different pathogens. The limited effect of intrinsic disease resistance on the seed proteome is consistent with the main mediators of disease resistance being present in the leaves and stems of the plant. The seeds of barley varieties accredited for use as malt had higher levels of proteins associated with starch synthesis and beer quality. The proteomic workflows developed and implemented here have potential application in quality control, breeding and processing of barley, and other agricultural products."

However, few studies have addressed the early vocalizations of infants and toddlers who were later diagnosed, as older children, with childhood apraxia of speech (CAS). We refer to these infants and toddlers as LCAS. Extant studies also often lack a comparison group of infants and toddlers who were later diagnosed, as older children, with a speech sound disorder (SSD). We refer to these infants and toddlers as LSSD. We aimed to compare the volubility, consonant emergence, and syllabic structure from birth to age of 2 years, as observed in home videos, among 3 groups of infants and toddlers: LCAS, LSSD, and typically developing (TD). Method We assessed the speech-language skills of 17 children (3.5-8.8 years old; 7 with CAS, 5 with SSD, and 5 TD) and transcribed home videos (obtained from parents) of these same children from birth to age of 2 years. Early vocalizations were coded as nonresonant or resonant. Nonresonant vocalizations could not be transcribed with the International Phonetic Alphabet. Resonant (speechlike) vocalizations were broadly transcribed, and resonant consonants were categorized by place, manner, and voicing. Results Effect size comparisons revealed LCAS infants and toddlers were less voluble, used fewer resonant consonants, had a less diverse phonetic repertoire, and acquired resonant consonants later than either the LSSD or TD participants. For LSSD infants and toddlers, means for these dependent variables were lower than the means demonstrated by the TD group, but effect size were not strong due to LSSD variability. Conclusions Findings imply there might be clinical ""red flags"" that could assist the identification of infants and toddlers at risk for later diagnosis of CAS. Data did not support red flags for identifying infants and toddlers at risk for later diagnosis of SSD. Because of significant study limitations, results obtained should be considered preliminary.

The purpose of this study was to identify differences in language produced during different discourse tasks in a large aphasia group and an age- and education-matched control group. Method Four structured discourse tasks across 3 discourse types (expositional, narrative, and procedural) were evaluated in a group of adults with aphasia ( n = 90) and an age-matched control group ( n = 84) drawn from AphasiaBank. CLAN software was used to extract primary linguistic variables (mean length of utterance, propositional density, type-token ratio, words per minute, open-closed class word ratio, noun-verb ratio, and tokens), which served as proxies for various language abilities. Using a series of repeated-measures analyses of covariance, with significantly correlated demographic and descriptive variables as covariates, main effects of discourse type were evaluated. Results Despite an impoverished output from the aphasia group (i.e., the control group produced significantly more overall output), there was a main effect of discourse type on most primary linguistic variables in both groups, suggesting that, in adults with and without language impairments, each discourse type taxed components of the spoken language system to varying extents. Post hoc tests fleshed out these results, demonstrating that, for example, narrative discourse produced speech highest in propositional density. Conclusion Each discourse type taxes the language system in different ways, verifying the importance of using several discourse tasks and selecting the most sensitive discourse tasks when evaluating specific language abilities and outcomes.",E to Z Photoisomerization of Phytochrome Cph1Δ Exceeds the Born-Oppenheimer Adiabatic Limit.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181167,The journal of physical chemistry letters,2019 06 13,"The Born-Oppenheimer adiabatic limit applies broadly in chemistry because most reactions occur on the ground electronic state. Photochemical reactions involve two or more electronic states and need not be subject to this adiabatic limit. The spectroscopic signatures of nonadiabatic processes are subtle, and therefore, experimental investigations have been limited to the few systems dominated by single photochemical outcomes. Systems with branched excited-state pathways have been neglected, despite their potential to reveal insights into photochemical reactivity. Here we present experimental evidence from coherent three-dimensional electronic spectroscopy that the E to Z photoisomerization of phytochrome Cph1 is strongly nonadiabatic, and the simulations reproduce the measured features only when the photoisomerization proceeds nonadiabatically near, but not through, a conical intersection. The results broaden the general understanding of photoisomerization mechanisms and motivate future studies of nonadiabatic processes with multiple outcomes arising from branching on excited-state potential energy surfaces.",Observation of Intersubband Polaritons in a Single Nanoantenna Using Nano-FTIR Spectroscopy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181166,Nano letters,2019 06 12,"Strong coupling of an intersubband (ISB) electron transition in quantum wells to a subwavelength plasmonic nanoantenna can give rise to intriguing quantum phenomena, such as ISB polariton condensation, and enable practical devices including low threshold lasers. However, experimental observation of ISB polaritons in an isolated subwavelength system has not yet been reported. Here, we use scanning probe near-field microscopy and Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy to detect formation of ISB polariton states in a single nanoantenna. We excite the nanoantenna by a broadband IR pulse and spectrally analyze evanescent fields on the nanoantenna surface. We observe the distinctive splitting of the nanoantenna resonance peak into two polariton modes and two π-phase steps corresponding to each of the modes. We map ISB polariton dispersion using a set of nanoantennae of different sizes.

The intermediate C12H18Ni which has been isolated in the nickel-catalyzed trimerization of butadiene but too unstable for X-ray crystallography, is suggested here to have an open chain hexahapto 3,3-C12H18 ligand rather than the octahapto such ligand suggested by some investigators. The lowest energy (C4H6)3M structures of the other first row transition metals from vanadium to cobalt are found to have related structures with open chain C12H18 ligands having hapticities ranging from four to eight with hexahapto structures being most common. The nickel and cobalt (C12H18)M derivatives favor low-spin singlet and doublet spin states, respectively, whereas the manganese derivative (C12H18)Mn favors the high-spin sextet state corresponding to the half-filled d5 shell of Mn(II). A (C4H6)3Cr structure with three separate tetrahapto butadiene ligands analogous to the very stable (4-C4H6)3M (M = Mo, W) with the favored 18-electron metal configuration is found to be a very high energy structure relative to isomers containing an open chain C12H18 ligand.","An engineered B. subtilis inducible promoter system with over 10,000-fold dynamic range.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181163,ACS synthetic biology,2019 06 10,"Bacillus subtilis is the leading model Gram-positive bacterium, and a widely used chassis for industrial protein production. However, B. subtilis research is limited by a lack of inducible promoter systems with low leakiness and high dynamic range. Here, we engineer an inducible promoter system based on the T7 RNA Polymerase, the lactose repressor LacI, and a chimeric T7lac promoter PT7lac, integrated as a single copy in the B. subtilis genome. In the absence of IPTG, LacI strongly represses T7RNAP and PT7lac and minimizes leakiness. Addition of IPTG de-represses PT7lac and simultaneously induces expression of T7RNAP, resulting in very high output expression. Using green fluorescent and β-galactosidase reporter proteins, we estimate that LacI-T7 can regulate expression with a dynamic range of over 10,000, by far the largest reported for an inducible B. subtilis promoter system. Furthermore, LacI-T7 responds to similar IPTG concentrations and with similar kinetics as the widely used Phy-spank IPTG-inducible system, which we show has a dynamic range of at most 300 in a similar genetic context. Due to its superior performance, our LacI-T7 system should have broad applications in fundamental B. subtilis biology studies and biotechnological applications.",How Do Nuclei Couple to the Magnetic Moment of a Paramagnetic Center? A New Theory at the Gauntlet of the Experiments.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181162,The journal of physical chemistry letters,2019 06 10,"The recent derivation, based on pure quantum chemistry (QC) first principles, of the pseudocon-tact shifts (PCSs) caused by a paramagnetic metal center on far away nuclei has casted doubts on the validity of the semi-empirical (SE) theory, predicting PCSs to arise from the metal magnetic susceptibility anisotropy. The SE theory has been used and applied countless times, especially in the last two decades, to obtain structural information on proteins containing paramagnetic met-al ions. We show here that the QC and SE predictions can be directly tested against experiments, provided a suitable macromolecular system is used. The SE approach yields a good prediction of the experimental PCSs, while the QC one does not. It appears that the classic theory is able to grasp satisfactorily the underlying physics.",A Unified Force and Torque Balance for Colloid Transport: Predicting Attachment and Mobilization under Favorable and Unfavorable Conditions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181161,Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids,2019 06 10,"Colloid attachment and detachment behaviors concern a wide range of environmental contexts but have typically been mechanistically predicted exclusive of one another despite their obvious coupling. Furthermore, previous mechanistic prediction often addressed packed column contexts wherein specific forces and torques on the colloid could not be well constrained, preventing robust predictions. These weaknesses were addressed through direct observation experiments under conditions where perfect sink assumptions fail and allow calibration of the contact between the colloid and collector. Attachment and flow perturbation experiments in the presence of colloid-collector attraction (favorable conditions) permitted calibration of contact parameters without the complexity that comes with colloid-collector repulsion (unfavorable conditions). Combining calibrated contact parameters with discrete representative nanoscale heterogeneity (DRNH), developed to predict unfavorable attachment, provided an independent means to predict unfavorable detachment. The result was mechanistic prediction of colloid attachment and detachment that quantitatively agreed with experimental observation for both ionic strength and flow perturbation results, improving significantly upon previous qualitative prediction.",Thermodynamic View of Proton Activated Electron Transfer in Reaction Center of Photosynthetic Bacteria.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181159,The journal of physical chemistry. B,2019 06 10,"The temperature-dependence of the sequential coupling of proton transfer to the second interquinone electron transfer is studied in the reaction center proteins of photosynthetic bacteria modified by different mutations and treatment by divalent cations. The Eyring plots of kinetics were evaluated by the Marcus theory of electron and proton transfer. In mutants of electron transfer limitation (including the wild type), the observed thermodynamic parameters had to be corrected for those of the fast proton pre-equilibrium. The electron transfer is non-adiabatic with transmission coefficient 1•10-4 and the reorganization energy amounts 1.2 eV. If the proton transfer is the rate limiting step, the reorganization energy and the work terms fall in the range of 200-500 meV depending on the site of damage in the proton transfer chain. The product term is 100-150 meV larger than the reactant term. While the electron transfer mutants have low free energy of activation (~200 meV), the proton transfer variants show significantly elevated levels of free energy barrier (~500 meV). The second electron transfer in bacterial reaction center can serve as model system of coupled electron and proton transfer in other proteins or ion channels.",Linker Optimization and Therapeutic Evaluation of Phosphatidylserine-Targeting Zinc Dipicolylamine-based Drug Conjugates.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181158,Journal of medicinal chemistry,2019 06 10,"We report that compound 13, a novel phosphatidylserine-targeting zinc (II) dipicolylamine drug conjugate, readily triggers a positive feedback therapeutic loop through the in situ generation of phosphatidylserine at the tumor microenvironment.

This overview aims to identify systematic reviews and meta-analyses of studies aiming to improve health outcomes in university students, to assess their methodological quality, to identify the different types of interventions used and outcomes assessed, and to estimate their overall effect. Four electronic databases were searched until 19 March, 2018 following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The identified reviews were described and their methodological quality was rated. The studies of reviews were investigated to identify the different types of interventions used and outcomes assessed. Effectiveness was assessed by measuring the overall number of improved outcomes out of the total number of outcomes reported. As a result, 8 reviews were identified targeting food sales (n = 2), dietary (n = 3), PA (n = 1), WR (n = 1), or all outcomes (n = 1). The methodological quality of the reviews was moderate (n = 5) to low (n = 3). In all, the reviews included 122 studies, of which 36 used an environmental, 51 a face-to-face, 30 an e-intervention, and 5 a combined approach. Environmental interventions improved a moderate number of food sales (32 of 61) and dietary intake (22 of 47) outcomes. Face-to-face interventions improved a high number of dietary cognitive outcomes (15 of 18), a moderate number of dietary intake (28 of 65) and WR (11 of 18) outcomes, and a low number of PA behavioral (22 of 69) and cognitive (2 of 14) outcomes. E-interventions improved a high number of dietary cognitive variables (11 of 16) but had a low effect (≤33%) on the other types of outcomes. In conclusion, face-to-face and e-interventions improved cognitive variables toward diet or PA but were less effective in changing actual behaviors. Environmental interventions favorably changed food sales. Face-to-face and e-interventions moderately affected WR outcomes. Future research should focus on long-term studies.","Scar Quality of Skin Graft Borders: A Prospective, Randomized, Double Blinded Evaluation.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181140,Journal of burn care & research : official publication of the American Burn Association,2019 06 10,Prominent scars may remain around the border of a mature skin graft (SG) at the interface of the SG with normal skin.

Crops of the plant family Brassicaceae require more S compared to other crops for optimum growth and yield, with most S ultimately sequestered in the mature seeds as storage proteins cruciferin and napin, along with unique S rich secondary metabolite-glucosinolate (GSL). It is well established that S assimilation primarily takes place in the shoots rather than roots, and that sulphate is the major form in which S is transported and stored in plants. We carried out a developmental S audit to establish the net fluxes of S in two lines of B. juncea mustard where seed GSL content differed, but resulted in no yield penalty.","Late Gestation Supplementation of Corn Dried Distiller's Grains Plus Solubles to Beef Cows Fed A Low-Quality Forage: III. Effects on Mammary Gland Blood Flow, Colostrum and Milk Production, and Calf Body Weights.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181138,Journal of animal science,2019 06 10,"Objectives were to investigate the effects of supplementation with corn dried distiller's grains plus solubles (DDGS) to late gestating beef cows on arterial blood flow to the mammary glands during late gestation and early lactation; colostrum and milk production; dystocia and immunity; and calf BW. Cows were fed a control (CON; n = 15; 5.1% CP; 36.2% ADF) diet consisting of 90% corn stover and 10% corn silage on a dry basis offered ad libitum or CON diet with supplementation of DDGS (0.30% of BW; SUP n = 12). Mammary gland blood flow was assessed on d 245 of gestation. At parturition, maternal and calving parameters were assessed; colostrum and jugular blood was sampled; and dams were weighed. Mammary gland blood flow and milk production was measured on d 44 of lactation. Calves were weighed fortnightly for 8 wk and at weaning. Colostrum production tended to be greater in SUP dams than in CON dams (837 vs. 614 ± 95 g, P = 0.10). Calves of SUP dams were heavier at birth and 24 h (0 h, 43.2 vs. 39.8 ± 1.0 kg, P = 0.02; 24 h, 44.0 vs 40.4 ± 1.1 kg, P = 0.02). At birth and 24 h, blood pCO2 was greater in calves born to SUP dams (6.82 vs. 6.00 ± 0.41 kPa, P = 0.04). Serum IgG did not differ (P = 0.21) at 24 h. Ipsilateral mammary gland blood flow of SUP cows was greater than CON cows (2.76 vs. 1.76 ± 0.30 L/min; P = 0.03); however, when summed with contralateral, total blood flow was similar (P = 0.33). Hemodynamic measures on d 44 of lactation were similar (P ≥ 0.32). Milk production tended to be increased (13.5 vs. 10.2 ± 1.2 kg/d, P = 0.07) in SUP vs. CON cows. Despite similar BW through 56 d, calves from SUP cows were heavier (P = 0.04) at weaning (309.7 vs. 292.0 ± 6.0 kg). In conclusion, we accept our hypothesis that DDGS supplementation during gestation influenced mammary blood flow, milk production and calf weights. These findings implicate maternal nutrition's leverage on both nutrient and passive immunity delivery to the calf early in life as well as potential advantages on long term performance.",Embedding research recruitment in a community resource e-prescribing system: lessons from an implementation study on Chicago's South Side.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181137,Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,2019 06 10,The study sought to implement and assess the CommunityRx e-prescribing system to recruit research participants from a predominantly non-Hispanic Black community on Chicago's South Side.,Pediatric Mucormycosis: A 10-Year Systematic Review of Reported Cases and Review of the Literature.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181136,Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society,2019 06 10,"Mucormycosis is a severe infection that affects a variety of patients, including immunocompromised children and neonates.

In order to better understand the effects of these antipsychotic drugs on the visual responses of P23H rat RGCs, I examined the responses of RGCs to a drifting sinusoidal grating of various contrasts. In-vitro multielectrode array recordings were made from P23H rat RGCs and healthy Sprague-Dawley (SD) rat RGCs. Retinas were stimulated with a drifting sinusoidal grating with eight values of contrast (0, 4, 6, 8.5, 13, 26, 51, and 83%). Contrast response functions based on response amplitudes were fitted with a hyperbolic ratio function and contrast thresholds were determined from the fitted curves. SD rat RGCs were divided into two categories, saturating and non-saturating cells, based on whether they showed saturation of responses at high contrast levels. Most SD rat RGCs (58%) were saturating cells. Haloperidol and clozapine decreased the responses of saturating SD rat RGCs to all grating contrasts, except for the highest contrast tested. Clozapine also decreased the responses of non-saturating SD rat RGCs to all grating contrasts, except for the highest contrast tested. Haloperidol did not however significantly affect the responses of non-saturating SD rat RGCs. Haloperidol and clozapine increased the contrast thresholds of both saturating and non-saturating cells in SD rat retinas. Most (73%) P23H rat RGCs could be categorized as either saturating or non-saturating cells. The remaining 'uncategorized' cells were poorly responsive to the drifting grating and were analyzed separately. Haloperidol and clozapine increased the responses of non-saturating and uncategorized P23H rat RGCs to most grating contrasts, including the highest contrast tested. Haloperidol and clozapine also increased the responses of saturating P23H rat RGCs to most grating contrasts but these increases were not statistically significant. Haloperidol and clozapine decreased the contrast thresholds of saturating cells, non-saturating cells and uncategorized cells in P23H rat retinas, although the decrease in contrast thresholds of saturating cells was not found to be statistically significant. Overall, the findings show that haloperidol and clozapine have differential effects on the contrast response functions of SD and P23H rat RGCs. In contrast to the effects observed on SD rat RGCs, both haloperidol and clozapine increased the responsiveness of P23H rat RGCs to both low and high contrast visual stimuli and decreased contrast thresholds.",Development of a markerless gene deletion strategy using rpsL as a counterselectable marker and characterization of the function of RA0C_1534 in Riemerella anatipestifer ATCC11845 using this strategy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181133,PloS one,2019 06 10,"Riemerella anatipestifer is a gram-negative bacterium that mainly infects ducks, turkeys and other birds. In a previous study, we established a markerless mutation system based on the pheS mutant as a counterselectable marker. However, the toxic effect of p-Cl-Phe on the R. anatipestifer strain expressing the pheS mutant was weak on blood agar plates. In this study, we successfully obtained streptomycin-resistant derivative of R. anatipestifer ATCC11845 using 100 μg/mL streptomycin as a selection pressure. Then, we demonstrate that rpsL can be used as a counterselectable marker in the R. anatipestifer ATCC11845 rpsL mutant strain, namely, R. anatipestifer ATCCs. A suicide vector carrying wild-type rpsL, namely, pORS, was constructed and used for markerless deletion of the gene RA0C_1534, which encodes a putative sigma-70 family RNA polymerase sigma factor. Using rpsL as a counterselectable marker, markerless mutagenesis of RA0C_1534 was also performed based on natural transformation. R. anatipestifer ATCCsΔRA0C_1534 was more sensitive to H2O2-generated oxidative stress than R. anatipestifer ATCCs. Moreover, transcription of RA0C_1534 was upregulated under 10 mM H2O2 treatment and upon mutation of fur. These results suggest that RA0C_1534 is involved in oxidative stress response in R. anatipestifer. The markerless gene mutation method developed in this study provides new tools for investigation of the physiology and pathogenic mechanisms of this bacterium."

To gain access to the central nervous system, GBS must interact with and penetrate brain or meningeal blood vessels; however, the exact mechanisms are still being elucidated. Here, we investigate the contribution of BspC, an antigen I/II family adhesin, to the pathogenesis of GBS meningitis. Disruption of the bspC gene reduced GBS adherence to human cerebral microvascular endothelial cells (hCMEC), while heterologous expression of BspC in non-adherent Lactococcus lactis conferred bacterial attachment. In a murine model of hematogenous meningitis, mice infected with ΔbspC mutants exhibited lower mortality as well as decreased brain bacterial counts and inflammatory infiltrate compared to mice infected with WT GBS strains. Further, BspC was both necessary and sufficient to induce neutrophil chemokine expression. We determined that BspC interacts with the host cytoskeleton component vimentin, and confirmed this interaction using a bacterial two-hybrid assay, microscale thermophoresis, immunofluorescent staining, and imaging flow cytometry. Vimentin null mice were protected from WT GBS infection and also exhibited less inflammatory cytokine production in brain tissue. These results suggest that BspC and the vimentin interaction is critical for the pathogenesis of GBS meningitis.",In cultured cells the baculovirus P10 protein forms two independent intracellular structures that play separate roles in occlusion body maturation and their release by nuclear disintegration.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181119,PLoS pathogens,2019 06 10,"P10 is a small, abundant baculovirus protein that accumulates to high levels in the very late stages of the infection cycle. It is associated with a number of intracellular structures and implicated in diverse processes from occlusion body maturation to nuclear stability and lysis. However, studies have also shown that it is non-essential for virus replication, at least in cell culture. Here, we describe the use of serial block-face scanning electron microscopy to achieve high-resolution 3D characterisation of P10 structures within Trichoplusia ni TN-368 cells infected with Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus. This has enabled unparalleled visualisation of P10 and determined the independent formation of dynamic perinuclear and nuclear vermiform fibrous structures. Our 3D data confirm the sequence of ultrastructural changes that create a perinuclear cage from thin angular fibrils within the cytoplasm. Over the course of infection in cultured cells, the cage remodels to form a large polarised P10 mass and we suggest that these changes are critical for nuclear lysis to release occlusion bodies. In contrast, nuclear P10 forms a discrete vermiform structure that was observed in close spatial association with both electron dense spacers and occlusion bodies; supporting a previously suggested role for P10 and electron dense spacers in the maturation of occlusion bodies. We also demonstrate that P10 hyper-expression is critical for function. Decreasing levels of p10 expression, achieved by manipulation of promoter length, correlated with reduced P10 production, a lack of formation of P10 structures and a concomitant decrease in nuclear lysis.",Challenges and strategies in patients' health priorities-aligned decision-making for older adults with multiple chronic conditions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181117,PloS one,2019 06 10,"While patients' health priorities should inform healthcare, strategies for doing so are lacking for patients with multiple conditions.

We were therefore surprised to find that a single fimbrial gene reconstitution can return the virulence-attenuated commensal strain Escherichia coli 83972 to virulence, defined by a disease phenotype in human hosts. E. coli 83972pap stably reprogrammed host gene expression, by activating an acute pyelonephritis-associated, IRF7-dependent gene network. The PapG protein was internalized by human kidney cells and served as a transcriptional agonist of IRF-7, IFN-β and MYC, suggesting direct involvement of the fimbrial adhesin in this process. IRF-7 was further identified as a potent upstream regulator (-log (p-value) = 61), consistent with the effects in inoculated patients. In contrast, E. coli 83972fim transiently attenuated overall gene expression in human hosts, enhancing the effects of E. coli 83972. The inhibition of RNA processing and ribosomal assembly indicated a homeostatic rather than a pathogenic end-point. In parallel, the expression of specific ion channels and neuropeptide gene networks was transiently enhanced, in a FimH-dependent manner. The studies were performed to establish protective asymptomatic bacteriuria in human hosts and the reconstituted E. coli 83972 variants were developed to improve bacterial fitness for the human urinary tract. Unexpectedly, P fimbriae were able to drive a disease response, suggesting that like oncogene addiction in cancer, pathogens may be addicted to single super-virulence factors.",Chemogenomic profiling in yeast reveals antifungal mode-of-action of polyene macrolactam auroramycin.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181115,PloS one,2019 06 10,"In this study, we report antifungal activity of auroramycin against Candida albicans, Candida tropicalis, and Cryptococcus neoformans. Auroramycin, a potent antimicrobial doubly glycosylated 24-membered polyene macrolactam, was previously isolated and characterized, following CRISPR-Cas9 mediated activation of a silent polyketide synthase biosynthetic gene cluster in Streptomyces rosesporous NRRL 15998. Chemogenomic profiling of auroramycin in yeast has linked its antifungal bioactivity to vacuolar transport and membrane organization. This was verified by disruption of vacuolar structure and membrane integrity of yeast cells with auroramycin treatment. Addition of salt but not sorbitol to the medium rescued the growth of auroramycin-treated yeast cells suggesting that auroramycin causes ionic stress. Furthermore, auroramycin caused hyperpolarization of the yeast plasma membrane and displayed a synergistic interaction with cationic hygromycin. Our data strongly suggest that auroramycin inhibits yeast cells by causing leakage of cations from the cytoplasm. Thus, auroramycin's mode-of-action is distinct from known antifungal polyenes, reinforcing the importance of natural products in the discovery of new anti-infectives.","Spreading dynamics in a cattle trade network: Size, speed, typical profile and consequences on epidemic control strategies.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181112,PloS one,2019 06 10,"Infections can spread among livestock notably because infected animals can be brought to uncontaminated holdings, therefore exposing a new group of susceptible animals to the disease. As a consequence, the structure and dynamics of animal trade networks is a major focus of interest to control zoonosis. We investigate the impact of the chronology of animal trades on the dynamics of the process. Precisely, in the context of a basic SI model spreading, we measure on the French database of bovine transfers to what extent a snapshot-based analysis of the cattle trade networks overestimates the epidemic risks. We bring into light that an analysis taking into account the chronology of interactions would give a much more accurate assessment of both the size and speed of the process. For this purpose, we model data as a temporal network that we analyze using the link stream formalism in order to mix structural and temporal aspects. We also show that in this dataset, a basic SI spreading comes down in most cases to a simple two-phases scenario: a waiting period, with few contacts and low activity, followed by a linear growth of the number of infected holdings. Using this portrait of the spreading process, we identify efficient strategies to control a potential outbreak, based on the identification of specific elements of the link stream which have a higher probability to be involved in a spreading process.",L-dopa response pattern in a rat model of mild striatonigral degeneration.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181111,PloS one,2019 06 10,"Unresponsiveness to dopaminergic therapies is a key feature in the diagnosis of multiple system atrophy (MSA) and a major unmet need in the treatment of MSA patients caused by combined striatonigral degeneration (SND).

The aim of the current study was to replicate mild stage MSA-P/SND with L-dopa failure.",The regulatory control of Cebpa enhancers and silencers in the myeloid and red-blood cell lineages.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181110,PloS one,2019 06 10,"Cebpa encodes a transcription factor (TF) that plays an instructive role in the development of multiple myeloid lineages. The expression of Cebpa itself is finely modulated, as Cebpa is expressed at high and intermediate levels in neutrophils and macrophages respectively and downregulated in non-myeloid lineages. The cis-regulatory logic underlying the lineage-specific modulation of Cebpa's expression level is yet to be fully characterized. Previously, we had identified 6 new cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) in a 78kb region surrounding Cebpa. We had also inferred the TFs that regulate each CRM by fitting a sequence-based thermodynamic model to a comprehensive reporter activity dataset. Here, we report the cis-regulatory logic of Cebpa CRMs at the resolution of individual binding sites. We tested the binding sites and functional roles of inferred TFs by designing and constructing mutated CRMs and comparing theoretical predictions of their activity against empirical measurements in a myeloid cell line. The enhancers were confirmed to be activated by combinations of PU.1, C/EBP family TFs, Egr1, and Gfi1 as predicted by the model. We show that silencers repress the activity of the proximal promoter in a dominant manner in G1ME cells, which are derived from the red-blood cell lineage. Dominant repression in G1ME cells can be traced to binding sites for GATA and Myb, a motif shared by all of the silencers. Finally, we demonstrate that GATA and Myb act redundantly to silence the proximal promoter. These results indicate that dominant repression is a novel mechanism for resolving hematopoietic lineages. Furthermore, Cebpa has a fail-safe cis-regulatory architecture, featuring several functionally similar CRMs, each of which contains redundant binding sites for multiple TFs. Lastly, by experimentally demonstrating the predictive ability of our sequence-based thermodynamic model, this work highlights the utility of this computational approach for understanding mammalian gene regulation.",Depression among people living with type 2 diabetes in an urbanizing community of Nepal.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181109,PloS one,2019 06 10,Diabetes mellitus is a major public health problem which accounts for serious medical and economic consequences.

While the number of civilian casualties is a frequently used indicator to evaluate intensity of violence in conflict, the inclusion of other indicators may provide a more complete understanding of how war impacts people and their communities. The Syrian conflict has been specifically marked by attacks against healthcare facilities, and the advancement of technology has provided an avenue for remote data analysis of conflict trends. This study aims to determine the feasibility of using publicly available, online data of attacks on healthcare facilities to better describe population-level violence in the Syrian Civil War.","Risk factors of stunting (chronic undernutrition) of children aged 6 to 24 months in Mekelle City, Tigray Region, North Ethiopia: An unmatched case-control study.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181094,PloS one,2019 06 10,"In 2014, 159 million under 5 year-old children were stunted (suffered chronic undernutrition) worldwide.

To date, most studies of gastrointestinal parasites focus on host-parasite systems that involve either a single parasite or a host species. However, when hosts share habitat and resources, they may also cross-transmit generalist gastrointestinal parasites. Here we explore multi-host-parasite interactions in a single ecosystem to understand the infection patterns, especially those linked to livestock-wildlife interfaces and zoonotic risk.","An observational, prospective, multicenter study on rescue high-frequency oscillatory ventilation in neonates failing with conventional ventilation.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181092,PloS one,2019 06 10,"To achieve gas exchange goals and mitigate lung injury, infants who fail with conventional ventilation (CV) are generally switched to high-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV).

Currently, rice is the second most consumed cereal in the world and production losses caused by extreme temperature events in the context of ""major climatic changes"" can have major impacts on the world economy. We report here an analysis of rice genotypes in response to low-temperature stress, studied through physiological gas-exchange parameters, biochemical changes in photosynthetic pigments and antioxidants, and at the level of gene and protein expression, towards an understanding and identification of multiple low-temperature tolerance mechanisms. The first effects of cold stress were observed on photosynthesis among all genotypes. However, the tropical japonica genotypes Secano do Brazil and Cypress had a greater reduction in gas exchange parameters like photosynthesis and water use efficiency in comparison to the temperate japonica Nipponbare and M202 genotypes. The analysis of biochemical profiles showed that despite the impacts of low temperature on tolerant plants, they quickly adjusted to maintain their cellular homeostasis by an accumulation of antioxidants and osmolytes like phenolic compounds and proline. The cold tolerant and sensitive genotypes showed a clear difference in gene expression at the transcript level for OsGH3-2, OsSRO1a, OsZFP245, and OsTPP1, as well as for expression at the protein level for LRR-RLKs, bHLH, GLYI, and LTP1 proteins. This study exemplifies the cold tolerant features of the temperate japonica Nipponbare and M202 genotypes, as observed through the analysis of physiological and biochemical responses and the associated changes in gene and protein expression patterns. The genes and proteins showing differential expression response are notable candidates towards understanding the biological pathways affected in rice and for engineering cold tolerance, to generate cultivars capable of maintaining growth, development, and reproduction under cold stress. We also propose that the mechanisms of action of the genes analyzed are associated with the tolerance response.",Assessment of progress in education for children and youth with disabilities in Afghanistan: A multilevel analysis of repeated cross-sectional surveys.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181088,PloS one,2019 06 10,"Recent study shows that 617 million children and adolescents-or six out of 10 globally- are not acquiring minimum levels in literacy and mathematics, indicating the magnitude of the learning acquisition problem. For children with disabilities in context of conflict, the situation is arguably even worse: the literature shows that they face difficulties to access the education system due to multiple barriers, and when they do access, they are not learning. Our paper examines if an active education policy promoting inclusion since 2005 in Afghanistan, a protracted crisis context, has been effective. Using two cross sectional household surveys carried out eight years apart (2005-2013), our study shows that access to school and literacy did not improve between 2005 and 2013 for children and youth with disabilities. Both access and literacy outcomes were worse for girls with disabilities, those with a mental, learning or associated disability and those living in household where the head was uneducated. Finally, odds of being mentally distressed significantly declined between 2005 and 2013 indicating that schools might play a protective role for children with disabilities in Afghanistan. Our findings suggest that a multilevel multi-pronged adaptation of the existing system to improve the learning experience and promote children's resilience, particularly for children with disabilities, in conflict context such as Afghanistan, is required."
