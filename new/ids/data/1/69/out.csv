To counteract these stressful conditions, they contain a multifaceted array of detoxifying systems that, in conjugation with cellular repairing mechanisms and in close crosstalk with metal homeostasis, allow them to survive in the presence of O2 and reactive oxygen species. Some of these systems are shared with aerobes, but two families of enzymes emerged more recently that, although not restricted to anaerobes, are predominant in anaerobic microbes. These are the iron-containing superoxide reductases, and the flavodiiron proteins, endowed with O2 and/or NO reductase activities, which are the subject of this Review. A detailed account of their physicochemical, physiological and molecular mechanisms will be presented, highlighting their unique properties in allowing survival of anaerobes in oxidative stress conditions, and comparing their properties with the most well-known detoxifying systems.",New red-shifted fluorescent biosensor for monitoring intracellular redox changes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735840,Free radical biology & medicine,2019 04 08,"Maintenance of intracellular redox homeostasis is critical for cell survival, proliferation, differentiation, and signaling. In this regard, major changes in the intracellular redox milieu may lead to cell death whereas subtle increases in the level of certain oxidizing species may act as signals that regulate a plethora of cellular processes. Redox-sensitive variants of green fluorescent proteins (roGFP2 and rxYFP) were developed and proved useful to monitor intracellular redox changes in a non-invasive and online manner. With the aim to extend the spectral range of the fluorescent redox biosensors, we here describe the generation, biochemical characterization and biological validation of a new redox reporter based on the red-shifted mRuby2 protein (rxmRuby2). Spectrofluorimetric analysis performed with the recombinant biosensor shows a reversible redox response produced by two redox-active cysteine residues predicted by molecular modeling. rxmRuby2 is highly selective for the couple glutathione/glutathione disulfide in the presence of the oxidoreductase glutaredoxin. The estimated redox potential of rxmRuby2 (E° -265 ± 22 mV) makes it suitable for its use in reducing subcellular compartments. Titration assays demonstrated the capacity of rxmRuby2 to monitor redox changes within a physiological pH range. rxmRuby2 responded sensitively and reversibly to different redox stimuli applied to HeLa and HEK293 cells expressing transiently and/or stable the biosensor. Fusing rxmRuby2 to the Clover fluorescent protein allowed normalization of the redox signal to the expression level of the reporter protein and/or to other factors that may affect fluorescence. The new red-shifted redox biosensor show promises for deep-tissue and in vivo imaging applications.","Critical role of H2O2 in mediating sanguinarine-induced apoptosis in prostate cancer cells via facilitating ceramide generation, ERK1/2 phosphorylation, and Par-4 cleavage.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735839,Free radical biology & medicine,2019 04 08,"Natural products are a major source of potential anticancer agents, and in order to develop improved and more effective cancer treatments, there is an immense need in exploring and elucidating their mechanism of action. Sanguinarine (SNG), a quaternary benzophenanthridine alkaloid, has been shown to induce cytotoxicity in various human cancers and suppresses various pro-tumorigenic processes such as invasion, angiogenesis, and metastasis in different cancers. Lack of understanding the anticancer mechanism(s) of SNG has impeded the development of this molecule as a potential anticancer agent. Earlier, we have reported that SNG induces reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent ceramide (Cer) generation and Akt dephosphorylation, leading to the induction of apoptosis in human leukemic cells. In the present study, we demonstrate that SNG has potent anti-proliferative activity against prostate cancer cells. Our data suggest that SNG induces Cer generation via inhibiting acid ceramidase and glucosylceramide synthase, two important enzymes involved in Cer metabolism. Furthermore, we demonstrate that SNG induces ROS-depended extracellular signal-regulated kinase1/2 (ERK1/2) phosphorylation, and prostate apoptosis response-4 (Par-4) cleavage, leading to the induction of apoptosis in human prostate cancer cells. Overall, our findings provide molecular insight into the role of ROS signaling in the anticancer mechanism(s) of SNG. This may provide the basis for its use as a nontoxic and an effective therapeutic agent in the treatment of prostate cancer.",The free radical theory of frailty: Mechanisms and opportunities for interventions to promote successful aging.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735838,Free radical biology & medicine,2019 06 02,"The free radical theory of ageing has provided a framework of research into ageing based on Harman's idea that ageing was caused by damage produced by free radicals. However, several experiments have cast doubts on the general validity of the theory. The postulation of the free radical theory of frailty came from two basic facts: first that radicals not only act as damaging molecules, but also as signals to control cell function and second that on many occasions oxidative damage does not correlate with chronological but rather with unsuccessful ageing. Frailty is a geriatric concept by which an older person shows a lack of the feeling of wellbeing, unintentional weight loss, a relatively low grip strength, lowering the speed of walking, and difficulties to stand. If left untreated, frailty progresses to disability. Many interventions that prevent oxidative damage to cells do not affect longevity but have a clear effect on the prevention of frailty and its transition to disability. Clinical trials have shown that exercise programmes do not promote longevity but delay the onset of frailty. Experiments and mechanisms to support this idea are described.",Sirt3 mediates the protective effect of hydrogen in inhibiting ROS-induced retinal senescence.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735837,Free radical biology & medicine,2019 04 29,"Hydrogen possesses antioxidative effects and cures numerous types of ophthalmopathy, but the mechanism of hydrogen on ROS-induced retinal senescence remains elusive. In this study, retinal morphology revealed that hydrogen reduced the number and size of vitreous black deposits in Bruch's membrane in NaIO3 mice. Hydrogen also reduced ROS levels in the retina as assessed by DHE staining. Moreover, this result was consistent with the downregulation of expression of the oxidative stress hallmark OGG1. These findings suggested that hydrogen can reduce retinal oxidative stress induced by NaIO3, and this result was further verified using the antioxidant ALCAR. Mechanistic analysis revealed that hydrogen significantly inhibited the downregulation of Sirt3 expression, and this notion was confirmed using AICAR, which restores Sirt3 expression and activity. Moreover, hydrogen reduced the expression of p53, p21 and p16 and the number of blue-green precipitations in the retinas of NaIO3 mice as assessed by SA-β-gal staining. We also found that hydrogen decreased the expression of the DNA damage-related protein ATM, cyclinD1 and NF-κB but increased the expression of the DNA repair-related protein HMGB1, suggesting that hydrogen inhibits senescence in retinas of NaIO3 mice. Additionally, OCT examination revealed that hydrogen suppressed retinal high reflex formation significantly and prevented the retina from thinning. This result was supported by ERG assays that demonstrated that hydrogen prevented the reduction in a- and b-wave amplitude induced by NaIO3 in mice. Thus, our data suggest that hydrogen may inhibit retinal senescence by suppressing the downregulation of Sirt3 expression through reduced oxidative stress reactions.",Evolutionary adaptations that enable enzymes to tolerate oxidative stress.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735836,Free radical biology & medicine,2019 02 28,"Biochemical mechanisms emerged and were integrated into the metabolic plan of cellular life long before molecular oxygen accumulated in the biosphere. When oxygen levels finaly rose, they threatened specific types of enzymes: those that use organic radicals as catalysts, and those that depend upon iron centers. Nature has found ways to ensure that such enzymes are still used by contemporary organisms. In some cases they are restricted to microbes that reside in anoxic habitats, but in others they manage to function inside aerobic cells. In the latter case, it is frequently true that the ancestral enzyme has been modified to fend off poisoning. In this review we survey a range of protein adaptations that permit radical-based and low-potential iron chemistry to succeed in oxic environments. In many cases, accessory domains shield the vulnerable radical or metal center from oxygen. In others, the structures of iron cofactors evolved to less oxidizable forms, or alternative metals replaced iron altogether. The overarching view is that some classes of biochemical mechanism are intrinsically incompatible with the presence of oxygen. The structural modification of target enzymes is an under-recognized response to this problem.","Geobiological feedbacks, oxygen, and the evolution of nitrogenase.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735835,Free radical biology & medicine,2019 03 17,"Biological nitrogen fixation via the activity of nitrogenase is one of the most important biological innovations, allowing for an increase in global productivity that eventually permitted the emergence of higher forms of life. The complex metalloenzyme termed nitrogenase contains complex iron-sulfur cofactors. Three versions of nitrogenase exist that differ mainly by the presence or absence of a heterometal at the active site metal cluster (either Mo or V). Mo-dependent nitrogenase is the most common while V-dependent or heterometal independent (Fe-only) versions are often termed alternative nitrogenases since they have apparent lower activities for N2 reduction and are expressed in the absence of Mo. Phylogenetic data indicates that biological nitrogen fixation emerged in an anaerobic, thermophilic ancestor of hydrogenotrophic methanogens and later diversified via lateral gene transfer into anaerobic bacteria, and eventually aerobic bacteria including Cyanobacteria. Isotopic evidence suggests that nitrogenase activity existed at 3.2 Ga, prior to the advent of oxygenic photosynthesis and rise of oxygen in the atmosphere, implying the presence of favorable environmental conditions for oxygen-sensitive nitrogenase to evolve. Following the proliferation of oxygenic phototrophs, diazotrophic organisms had to develop strategies to protect nitrogenase from oxygen inactivation and generate the right balance of low potential reducing equivalents and cellular energy for growth and nitrogen fixation activity. Here we review the fundamental advances in our understanding of biological nitrogen fixation in the context of the emergence, evolution, and taxonomic distribution of nitrogenase, with an emphasis placed on key events associated with its emergence and diversification from anoxic to oxic environments.",CD36 dependent redoxosomes promotes ceramide-mediated pancreatic β-cell failure via p66Shc activation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735834,Free radical biology & medicine,2019 04 08,"Altered metabolism is implicated in the pathogenesis of beta-cell failure in type 2 diabetes (T2D). Plasma and tissue levels of ceramide species play positive roles in inflammatory and oxidative stress responses in T2D. However, oxidative targets and mechanisms underlying ceramide signaling are unclear. We investigated the role of CD36-dependent redoxosome (redox-active endosome), a membrane-based signaling agent, in ceramide-induced beta-cell dysfunction and failure. Exposure of beta cells to C2-ceramide (N-acetyl-sphingosine) induced a CD36-dependent non-receptor tyrosine kinase Src-mediated redoxosome (Vav2-Rac1-NOX) formation. Activated Rac1-GTP-NADPH oxidase complex induced c-Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation and nuclear factor (NF)-kB transcription, which was associated with thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP) upregulation and thioredoxin activity suppression. Upregulated JNK expression induced p66Shc serine36 phosphorylation and peroxiredoxin-3 hyperoxidation, causing beta-cell apoptosis via mitochondrial dysfunction. CD36 inhibition by sulfo-N-succinimidyl oleate (SSO) or CD36 siRNA blocked C2-ceramide-induced redoxosome activation, thereby decreasing JNK-dependent p66Shc serine36 phosphorylation. CD36 inhibition downregulated TXNIP expression and promoted thioredoxin activity via enhanced thioredoxin reductase activity, which prevented peroxiredoxin-3 oxidation. CD36 inhibition potentiated glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and prevented beta-cell apoptosis. Our results reveal a new role of CD36 during early molecular events that lead to Src-mediated redoxosome activation, which contributes to ceramide-induced pancreatic beta-cell dysfunction and failure.",Monitoring evidence on overall survival benefits of anticancer drugs approved by the European Medicines Agency between 2009 and 2015.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735832,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",2019 03 06,"The introduction provisional approval strategies increases the approval of anticancer drugs with ambiguous benefit-risk profiles.

Atherosclerosis is a multifactorial disorder and its pathophysiology is highly complex. Changes in expression of multiple genes coupled with environmental and lifestyle factors initiate cascades of adverse events involving multiple types of cells (e.g. vascular endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, and macrophages). IGF-1 is a pleiotropic factor, which is found in the circulation (endocrine IGF-1) and is also produced locally in arteries (endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells). IGF-1 exerts a variety of effects on these cell types in the context of the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. In fact, there is an increasing body of evidence suggesting that IGF-1 has beneficial effects on the biology of atherosclerosis. This review will discuss recent findings relating to clinical investigations on the relation between IGF-1 and cardiovascular disease and basic research using animal models of atherosclerosis that have elucidated some of the mechanisms underlying atheroprotective effects of IGF-1."

Umbelliferone - phospholipids complex (UPLC) was prepared using solvent evaporation method. UPLC-MF was prepared by simple and reproducible solvent casting method. Prepared UPLC and UPLC-MF were both physico-chemically characterized by Fourier transforms infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), powder x-ray diffraction (PXRD), proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H NMR), weight variation, thickness, tensile strength, folding endurance, % elongation, moisture content and uptake Functional characterization of UPLC and UPLC-MF was carried out by solubility analysis, in vitro dissolution, diffusion, and ex vivo permeation via dialysis and biological membrane. UPLC - MF was also evaluated for in vivo anti-inflammatory activity using carrageenan-induced Albino rat paw model. Design-based optimal values for formulation and process variables of UPLC were observed to be 1:1.78, 50 °C and 2 h, respectively. Physico-chemical characterization confirmed the formation of the complex and the film. UPLC demonstrated a higher aqueous solubility (~11-fold), compared to pure UMB. Rate and extent of dissolution of UMB from UPLC was enhanced significantly to that of pure UMB. Compared to UMB-MF, the diffusion and permeation rate of UMB from UPLC-MF enhanced significantly. The UPLC - MF improved the anti-inflammatory potential of UMB by significant enhancement of edema inhibition (%), compared to UMB-MF. The obtained results showed that the present combined formulation system could be employed as a promising strategy for improving transdermal permeation of UMB.",Prolonged release of metformin by SiO2 nanoparticles pellets for type II diabetes control.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735819,European journal of pharmaceutical sciences : official journal of the European Federation for Pharmaceutical Sciences,2019 03 09,"Mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNPs) were synthesized and loaded with metformin hydrochloride (Metf), its adsorption has studied at different concentrations and pHs, optimal adsorption conditions were determined. Hybrid MSNPs-Metf were mixed with chitosan to compress them and form quasi-spherical pellets, were coated with five chitosan layers as a barrier to prolong metformin release. It showed that this pellet is useful for metformin controlled release since drug over time was significantly delayed by the chitosan coating and then, as metformin is electrostatically linked to MSNPs, it also controls the release of drug, releasing 170 mg after 17 h of exposure at pH 1.2. When pH is >1.2, metformin release was significantly prolonged. Since 170 mg is 21% of a 850-mg metformin dose and previous studies report that 90% of metformin is recovered as unchanged drug in urine after 12 h of metformin intakes. These results suggest that MSNPs-Metf pellets, coated with chitosan, are an option to avoid excessive metformin ingest.","Oculomotor behavior and the level of repetition in motor practice: Effects on pupil dilation, eyeblinks and visual scanning.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735818,Human movement science,2019 05 13,"The benefits of less repetitive practice in motor learning have been explained by the increased demand for memory processes during the execution of motor skills. Recently, a new perspective associating increased demand for perception with less repetitive practice has also been proposed. Augmented information gathering and visual scanning characterize this higher perceptual demand. To extend our knowledge about mental effort and perceptual differences in practice organization, the association between oculomotor behavior and type of practice was investigated. We required participants to press four keys with different absolute and relative timing goals during the acquisition phase. An eye-tracker captured visual scanning of the skill's absolute and relative information displayed on the screen. Participants were tested 24 h after acquisition by a retention and transfer test. A higher level of both pupil dilation and amount of eyeblinks indicated an increased mental effort in less repetitive practice compared to more repetitive practice. Visual scanning of the skill's relative and absolute information was specific to the type of practice. The findings indicate many differences in oculomotor behavior associated with the practice schedule.",The role of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in the treatment of cognitive impairment in patients with Alzheimer's disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735817,Journal of the neurological sciences,2019 02 26,"Although repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has been considered a potentially effective treatment for cognitive impairment in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), previous studies have produced inconsistent results.

The ligand-receptor interactions enable the parasite to invade human erythrocytes, initiating the clinical symptoms of malaria. These interactions are likely to have had an evolutionary impact on the genes that encode the ligand and receptor proteins. We used sequence data from Kilifi, Kenya to detect departures from neutrality in a paired analysis of P. falciparum merozoite ligands and their erythrocyte receptor genes from the same population. We genotyped parasite and human DNA obtained from 93 individuals with severe malaria. We examined six merozoite ligands EBA175, EBL1, EBA140, MSP1, Rh4 and Rh5, and their corresponding erythrocyte receptors, glycophorin (Gyp) A, GypB, GypC, band 3, complement receptor (CR) 1 and basigin, focusing on the regions involved in the ligand-receptor interactions. Positive Tajima's D values (>1) were observed only in the MSP1 C-terminal region and EBA175 region II, while negative values (<-1) were observed in EBL-1 region II, Rh4, basigin exons 3 and 5, CR1 exon 5, Gyp B exons 2, 3 and 4 and Gyp C exon 2. Additionally, ebl-1 region II and basigin exon 3 showed extreme negative values in all three tests, Tajima's D, Fu & Li D* and F*, ≤ - 2. A large majority of the erythrocyte receptor and merozoite genes have a negative Tajima's D even when compared with previously published whole genome data. Thus, highlighting EBA175 region II and MSP1-33, as outlier genes with a positive Tajima's D (>1). Both these genes contain multiple polymorphisms, which in the case of EBA175 may counteract receptor polymorphisms and/or evade host immune responses and in MSP1 the polymorphisms may primarily evade host immune responses.",Geographical structure of bat SARS-related coronaviruses.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735813,"Infection, genetics and evolution : journal of molecular epidemiology and evolutionary genetics in infectious diseases",2019 02 26,Bats are the natural reservoirs of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) which caused the outbreak of human SARS in 2002-2003.

In this study, we hypothesized that the copresentation of interleukin (IL)-4 and stromal cell-derived factor (SDF)-1α in high-stiffness TG-gels may enhance periodontal regeneration by modulating Mφ polarization and promoting endogenous stem cell recruitment. We found that Mφs were more likely to polarize toward an immunomodulatory M2 state in the presence of IL-4 and hence positively influence the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs when these cells coexisted in either indirect or direct co-culture systems. In cell migration assays, BMSCs exhibited an enhanced capability to move toward gels containing SDF-1α, and more cells could be recruited into the three-dimensional matrix of TG-gels. When TG-gels containing IL-4 and/or SDF-1α were used to repair periodontal defects, more new bone (MicroCT) was formed in animals that received the dual cytokine-loaded transplants at 4 weeks postsurgery. Mφs were recruited to all the transplanted gels, and after one week, more M1-phenotype cells were found in the groups without IL-4, while the presence of IL-4 was more likely to result in M2 polarization (immunofluorescence staining). When the tissue biopsies were histologically examined, the TG-gels containing both IL-4 and SDF-1α led to a generally satisfactory regeneration with respect to attachment recovery (epithelial and connective tissue) and hybrid tissue regeneration (bone, periodontal ligament and cementum). Our data suggest that the incorporation of IL-4 into high-stiffness TG-gels may promote the M2 polarization of Mφs and that SDF-1α can be applied to guide endogenous cell homing. Overall, building capacity for Mφ modulation and cell recruitment in high-stiffness hydrogels represents a simple and effective strategy that can support high levels of periodontal tissue regeneration. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: The development of hydrogel-based regenerative therapies centered on the mobilization and stimulation of native cells for therapeutics opens a window toward realizing periodontal endogenous regeneration. In the present study, the parallel use of immunomodulatory and homing factors in high-stiffness hydrogel materials is shown to induce stem cell homing, modulate cell differentiation and indeed induce regrowth of the periodontium. We found that incorporation of interleukin (IL)-4 in high-stiffness TG-gels coaxed macrophages to polarize into M2 phenotypes, and stromal cell-derived factor (SDF)-1α could be applied to direct endogenous cell homing. Hence, we present for the first time a clinically relevant strategy based on macrophage modulation and host cell recruitment that can support high levels of periodontal tissue regeneration."

Current methods are based on Western healthy adult populations. Malnourished children have many differences in their gastrointestinal anatomy and physiology compared to a healthy Western adult. These differences may affect the oral absorption of medicines and it is important to gather knowledge on these GI differences in order to develop biorelevant predictive methods for this vulnerable population. A literature search was conducted within PubMed and Scopus to identify papers that describe how gastrointestinal physiology and anatomy is altered in malnourished children. Relevant data was extracted and a narrative review generated to describe how GI differences may affect oral drug absorption. Several differences in GI anatomy and physiology were reported in the literature including: reduced saliva secretion; increased gastric pH; slower gastric emptying; increased levels of bacteria in the small intestine; reduced surface area of intestinal villi and increased intestinal permeability. Much of the data was more than 30 years old and referred to a heterogeneous malnourished population. Sufficient data has been identified that will inform basic novel biorelevant methods to predict oral drug absorption in malnourished children. Further work is required to generate additional data to improve these models and also to verify the models with appropriate pharmacokinetic data.,Advanced glycation end-product 2 and Porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide increase sclerostin expression in mouse osteocyte-like cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735798,Bone,2019 03 30,"Sclerostin is a secreted glycoprotein that is mainly expressed in osteocytes, exerts negative effects on bone formation, and is present at elevated levels in diabetes mellitus (DM). Periodontitis is an infectious disease caused by periodontopathic bacteria, a complication of DM, and sometimes associated with severe inflammation and alveolar bone resorption. Advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) are a major pathogen in DM complications and adversely influence periodontitis in DM patients. In the present study, the effects of AGE2 and Porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide (P-LPS) on the expression of sclerostin in mouse osteocyte-like cells (MLO-Y4-A2 cells) and its function in osteoblast differentiation were investigated. AGE2 and P-LPS up-regulated the expressions of receptor of AGE (RAGE) and Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), respectively, and significantly up-regulated that of sclerostin and interleukin 6 (IL-6) in osteocytes. Sclerostin, RAGE and TLR2 levels were synergistically increased by AGE2 and P-LPS. The siRNAs of RAGE and TLR2 significantly inhibited AGE2- and P-LPS-induced sclerostin expression. AGE2 up-regulated sclerostin expression in osteocyte-like cells via the RAGE, ERK and JNK, and NF-κB signal pathways. On the other hand, P-LPS elevated sclerostin levels via the TLR2, JNK and p38, and NF-κB signal pathways. When osteocytes pre-treated with AGE2 and P-LPS and osteoblastic cells (MC3T3-E1) were co-cultured in the medium with a sclerostin-neutralizing antibody, AGE2- and P-LPS-induced decreases in alkaline phosphatase activity and Runx2 expression in osteoblastic cells were significantly inhibited by the sclerostin-neutralizing antibody. These results suggest that AGE2 and P-LPS influence bone metabolism and inflammation through the regulation of sclerostin expression, and may aggravate periodontitis with DM.",Skeletal responses to an all-female unassisted Antarctic traverse.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735797,Bone,2019 02 26,To investigate the skeletal effects of the first all-female trans-Antarctic traverse.,Senescent and apoptotic osteocytes and aging: Exercise to the rescue?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735796,Bone,2019 06 10,"Osteocytes are the most prevalent cell in the skeleton and are the master regulator of bone remodeling. Despite the understanding that osteocytes have a multiyear lifespan, and some factors induce apoptosis in osteocytes, much less is understood about the induction and consequences of osteocyte senescence. Filling these gaps in knowledge will provide novel approaches to slowing age-related bone loss and preventing fragility fractures. The purpose of this review is to examine the roles of senescence and apoptosis in osteocytes in age-related bone loss. Based on evidence that exercise can prevent senescence in skeletal muscle, we provide a novel hypothesis by which exercise can prolong skeletal health.",Gene co-expression network approach for predicting prognostic microRNA biomarkers in different subtypes of breast cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735795,Genomics,2019 02 10,"New diagnostic miRNA biomarkers for different types of cancer have been studied extensively, particularly for breast cancer (BC), which is a leading cause of death among women and has many different subtypes. In the present study, a systems biology approach was used to find remarkable and novel miRNA biomarkers for five molecular subtypes of BC: luminal A, luminal B, ERBB2, basal-like and normal-like. The mRNA expression data from the five BC subtypes was used to reconstruct co-expression networks. The important mRNA-miRNA interactions were considered when reconstructing the bipartite networks from which the five bipartite sub-networks were reconstructed for further analysis. The novel biomarkers detected for each subtype are as follows: miRNAs 26b-5p and 124-3p for basal-like, 26b-5p, 124-3p and 5011-5p for ERBB2, 26b-5p and 5011-5p for LumA, 124-3p, 26b-5p and 7-5p for LumB and 26b-5p, 124-3p and 193b-3p for normal-like. The roles of the identified miRNAs in the occurrence or development of each subtype of BC remain unclear and should be investigated in future studies. In addition, the target genes of these miRNAs may be critical to the mechanisms underlying each subtype and should be analyzed as therapeutic targets in future studies.",Should 'Omics' education be a part of allied health profession curricula?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735794,Genomics,2019 02 12,"Sequencing of human genome followed by monumental progress in omics sciences within last two decades has made personalized nutrition for better health is a reality for near future.

To bring this mission to fruition, we need trained healthcare professionals ready to educate public. With this in mind, we have surveyed allied health students for their omics knowledge, desire to learn more and their perception of the need of omics education.

Moreover, the effects of anodal tDCS not only occur during the stimulation but also persist after the stimulation has ended (after-effects). Here, the duration of the after-effects induced by repetitive anodal tDCS was investigated based on our previous studies. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into three groups: a sham group, a β-amyloid (Aβ) group (AD group) and a stimulation group (ATD group). Aβ was injected into the bilateral hippocampi of the rats in the AD and ATD groups to produce the AD model. Rats in the ATD group underwent 10 sessions of anodal tDCS, and the after-effects of repetitive anodal tDCS were evaluated by behavioral and histological analyses. A Morris water maze (MWM) was utilized on a monthly basis to assess spatial learning and memory abilities. The ATD group showed shorter escape latencies and more platform region crossings than the AD group. Hippocampal choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) immunohistochemical analyses were carried out after the last MWM assessment. The immunohistochemistry results showed notable differences among the groups, particularly between the AD and ATD groups. This study reveals that repetitive anodal tDCS can not only improve cognitive function and memory performance but also has long-term after-effects that persist for 2 months.",Impaired cerebellar plasticity and eye-blink conditioning in calpain-1 knock-out mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735788,Neurobiology of learning and memory,2019 02 13,"Calpain-1 and calpain-2 are involved in the regulation of several signaling pathways and neuronal functions in the brain. Our recent studies indicate that calpain-1 is required for hippocampal synaptic plasticity, including long-term depression (LTD) and long-term potentiation (LTP) in field CA1. However, little is known regarding the contributions of calpain-1 to cerebellar synaptic plasticity. Low frequency stimulation (LFS, 5 Hz, 5 min)-induced LTP at parallel fibers to Purkinje cell synapses was markedly impaired in cerebellar slices from calpain-1 knock-out (KO) mice. Application of a selective calpain-2 inhibitor enhanced LFS-induced LTP in both wild-type (WT) and calpain-1 KO mice. Three protocols were used to induce LTD at these synapses: LFS (1 Hz, 15 min), perfusion with high potassium and glutamate (K-Glu) or dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG), a mGluR1 agonist. All three forms of LTD were impaired in calpain-1 KO mice. DHPG application stimulated calpain-1 but not calpain-2 in cerebellar slices, and DHPG-induced LTD impairment was reversed by application of a protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) inhibitor, okadaic acid. As in hippocampus, BDNF induced calpain-1 activation and PH domain and Leucine-rich repeat Protein Phosphatase 1/suprachiasmatic nucleus oscillatory protein (PHLPP1/SCOP) degradation followed by extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation, as well as calpain-2 activation leading to degradation of phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten (PTEN) in cerebellar slices. The role of calpain-1 in associative learning was evaluated in the delay eyeblink conditioning (EBC). Calpain-1 KO mice exhibited significant learning impairment in EBC during the first 2 days of acquisition training. However, after 5 days of training, the percentage of conditioned responses (CRs) between calpain-1 KO and WT mice was identical. Both calpain-1 KO and WT mice exhibited typical extinction patterns. Our results indicate that calpain-1 plays critical roles in multiple forms of synaptic plasticity and associative learning in both hippocampus and cerebellum."

Part B, Biochemistry & molecular biology",2019 03 29,"Heat shock protein 90 (HSP90), which functions as a molecular chaperone, plays an important role in reproduction and cellular defense. Among the HSP90 family, HSP90AB is an important isoform. Stress-inducible protein 1 (Stip1) acts as a co-chaperone that mediates interactions with HSP90 and appears to be a player in spermatogenesis and stress response. However, the functions of both HSP90 and Stip1 during spermatogenesis and heat stress response in Boleophthalmus pectinirostris remain unknown. We investigated mRNA expression patterns of HSP90AB and Stip1 under heat stress conditions. The results showed that mRNA levels of HSP90AB and Stip1 were significantly upregulated in the gill and liver tissues, indicating that HSP90AB and Stip1 appear to play roles in protection against heat stress. Then we cloned the complete cDNA of HSP90AB and Stip1, which have product lengths of 2546 and 2652 bp, respectively. The predicted secondary and tertiary structures of B. pectinirostris. HSP90AB and Stip1 contain conserved domains. We investigated the expression patterns of HSP90AB and Stip1 in different tissues by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, HSP90AB and Stip1 were found to be ubiquitously expressed in all major tissues and exhibited varying expression levels, indicating that HSP90AB and Stip1 have conserved biological functions. HSP90AB and Stip1 were found to be strongly expressed in the testis, indicating their special roles in this organ. We also tracked the dynamic locations of germinal cells using in situ hybridization. Results from in situ hybridization and immunofluorescence localization showed that both mRNA transcripts and proteins of HSP90AB and Stip1 were ubiquitously expressed in spermatocytes, spermatids, and spermatozoa, indicating that HSP90AB and Stip1 are both involved in spermatogenesis.",A functional gene encoding carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 and its transcriptional and kinetic regulation during fasting in large yellow croaker.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735773,"Comparative biochemistry and physiology.

In this study, the complete cDNA sequence of cpt1a was cloned from liver of large yellow croaker (Larimichthys crocea), with an open reading frame of 2319 bp encoding a protein of 772 amino acids. Bioinformatics analysis predicted the presence of conserved functional motifs and amino acid residues. The highest mRNA expression of cpt1a was observed in the liver. Phylogenetic tree clearly shows that CPT1A protein is a homologue of mammalian CPT1A. Recombinant protein rCPT1A showed catalytic activity, with Michaelis constant (km) (≈1.38 mM) and maximal reaction rates (Vmax) for carnitine (≈12.66 nmols/min/mg protein). The cpt1a mRNA expression dramatically increased and CPT1 activity remained unchanged after fasting. Fasting did not significantly change Vmax and free carnitine (FC) content in liver. Interestingly, catalytic efficiency (Vmax/Km) and FC/Km increased in fish fasted for 4 days, implying FC contents might be enough to ensure the optimal fatty acid oxidation. Contrarily, both indicators declined when fish fasted for 12 days.

Clinically, both large muscles and respiratory muscles are reported to be involved in the myotoxic profile of statins. However, the experimental data investigating the myopathic mechanism on respiratory muscles are still lacking. The present work aimed to study the effect of atorvastatin treatment on respiratory muscles using rat isolated hemidiaphragm in normoxic & hypoxic conditions. The contractile activity of isolated hemidiaphragm in rats treated with atorvastatin for 21 days was investigated using nerve stimulated technique. Muscle twitches, train of four and tetanic stimulation was measured in normoxic, hypoxic and reoxygenation conditions. Atorvastatin significantly increased the tetanic fade, a measure of muscle fatigability, in hypoxic conditions. Upon reoxygenation, rat hemidiaphragm regains its normal contractile profile. Co-treatment with coenzyme Q10 showed significant improvement in defective diaphragmatic contractility in hypoxic conditions. This work showed that atorvastatin treatment rapidly deteriorates diaphragmatic activity in low oxygen environment. The mitochondrial respiratory dysfunction is probably the mechanism behind such finding. This was supported by the improvement of muscle contractile activity following CoQ10 co-treatment."

When new products are compared with accepted reference products by broad arrays of measurements, statistical analyses are usually summarised by significance tests or confidence intervals per endpoint. The traditional approach is to test for statistical significance of differences. However, absence or presence of significant differences is not a statement about safety. Equivalence limits are essential for safety assessment. We propose graphs to present the results of equivalence tests over the array of endpoints. It is argued that plots of the equivalence limit scaled difference (ELSD) are preferable over plots of the standardised effect size (SES) used previously for similar assessments. The ELSD method can be used either with externally specified equivalence limits or with equivalence limits estimated from (historical) data. The method is illustrated with two examples: first, environmental safety of MON810 Bt maize was assessed using field trial count data of arthropods; second, human safety of herbicide tolerant NK603 maize was assessed using haematological, biochemical and organ weight data from a 90-day rat feeding study.

Human colon adenocarcinoma cells (Caco-2), differentiated as normal enterocytes, were treated with pathological concentrations of LPS, in order to stimulate iNOS pathway, which involves NF-ĸB activation through IĸBα phosphorylation and subsequent degradation induced by Akt or MAPKs. All the tested metabolites inhibited NO release induced by LPS, acting as inhibitors of iNOS expression, with an efficacy comparable to that of the parent compounds. HT and Tyr metabolites were effective in the inhibition of IĸBα degradation. No one of the compounds was able to inhibit Akt activation, whereas they modulated p38 and ERK1/2 MAPK. Obtained data show that HT and Tyr metabolites are able to prevent a pathological NO overproduction at intestinal level, where they concentrate, thus significantly contributing to the protective activity exerted by their parent compounds against inflammation.",Broccoli sprout beverage is safe for thyroid hormonal and autoimmune status: Results of a 12-week randomized trial.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735751,Food and chemical toxicology : an international journal published for the British Industrial Biological Research Association,2019 05 06,"Sulforaphane is a redox-active natural product present in cruciferous vegetables like broccoli. Broccoli sprout-derived products are promising agents for the prevention of oxidative stress-related diseases, but some have long been suspected of thyroidal toxicity. Recent findings also raise the possibility that long-term exposure to sulforaphane, or to other natural substances or drugs that modulate the activity of the transcription factor Nrf2 (NFE2-related factor 2) may lead to thyroid dysfunction or thyroid autoimmune disease, questioning the safety of trials with sulforaphane-containing products. Previous studies addressing possible effects of sulforaphane-related compounds from natural product extracts on the thyroid were quite short and/or inconsistent. To investigate whether long-term exposure to a beverage enriched with sulforaphane and its precursor glucoraphanin may affect thyroid function, we analyzed biochemical measures of thyroid function and thyroid autoimmunity in 45 female participants in a randomized clinical trial at baseline and after 84 days of beverage administration. Serum levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone, free thyroxine and thyroglobulin were not affected by the treatment, and neither was the thyroid autoimmunity status of participants.

Significant differences (p < 0.05) were recorded among the various rice types and countries of origin. Overall, cooking had little effect on the THg concentrations in rice. Thiols play a major role in the fate of Hg, therefore thiol contents in rice were measured, and a weak but significant relationship between thiol and THg contents in rice (p < 0.05) was observed. An in vitro gastro-intestinal digestion method was used to assess the bioaccessibility rate of THg in cooked rice samples, and less than 44.5% of THg from the initial rice samples was bioaccessible after in vitro digestion. Dietary exposure to Hg through rice consumption was calculated for the typical Canadian population and values were all below current provisional tolerable weekly intake guidelines.

In addition, Dox significantly (p < 0.01) activated MAP kinases, NF-κB, and apoptosis in cardiac cells; while, significant (p < 0.01) impairment in PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling was observed in Dox-treated myocardial cells. On the other hand, WWGPE, apigenin, and ferulic acid significantly (p < 0.05-0.01) attenuated Dox-induced redox stress and oxidative stress-mediated signal transduction in myocardial cells. WWGPE, apigenin, and ferulic acid treatment also could significantly (p < 0.05-0.01) reinstate Dox-mediated changes in blood parameters in rats. Histological assessments were in agreement with the biochemical findings. Results showed that, WWGPE exhibited better cardio-protective effect over ferulic acid and apigenin, which may be due to the synergy between the comprising compounds and better oral bioavailability of dietary antioxidant molecules from whole phenolic extract.",Antidiabetic effect of quercetin: A systematic review and meta-analysis of animal studies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735748,Food and chemical toxicology : an international journal published for the British Industrial Biological Research Association,2019 05 20,"Quercetin is a plant polyphenol with biological activities such as anti-inflammatory, anticancer, antidiabetic, neuroprotective and anti-allergic. The objective of this review is to provide a systematic evaluation of the evidence and a meta-analysis of data from previously published researches on the antidiabetic action of quercetin. A comprehensive literature search was conducted between July 2018 and August 2018 on PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Sciences and Scopus databases. A random-effects model was used to estimate the pooled effect size and studies were weighted according to an estimate of the mean difference. The heterogeneity between studies was assessed using a Higgins' I2 test with corresponding p values. Overall 13 eligible articles with appropriate data on serum glucose were included in the statistical analysis. The meta-analysis for serum glucose level (mg/dL) showed that at doses of 10, 25 and 50 mg/kg there was a significant difference between the means. Therefore, the results of the meta-analysis support the hypothesis that quercetin lowers serum glucose level, at doses of 10, 25 and 50 mg/kg.",Microbial metabolites of proanthocyanidins reduce chemical carcinogen-induced DNA damage in human lung epithelial and fetal hepatic cells in vitro.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735747,Food and chemical toxicology : an international journal published for the British Industrial Biological Research Association,2019 05 20,"Seven selected microbial metabolites of proanthocyanidins (MMP), 3-phenylpropionic, 4-hydroxyphenyl acetic, 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl) propionic, p-coumaric, benzoic acid, pyrogallol (PG), and pyrocatechol (PC) were evaluated for their ability to reduce chemical carcinogen-induced toxicity in human lung epithelial cells (BEAS-2B) and human fetal hepatic cells (WRL-68). Cells pre-treated with MMP were exposed to a known chemical carcinogen, 4-[(acetoxymethyl) nitrosamino]-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNKOAc) to assess MMP-mediated cytoprotection and reduction of DNA damage. PG in BEAS-2B and PC in WRL-68 cells mitigated the NNKOAc-induced cytotoxicity. Pre-incubation of PG depicted significant protection against NNKOAc-induced DNA damage in BEAS-2B cells. PC in WRL-68 cells showed similar activity. To understand the mechanisms of PG- and PC-mediated DNA damage reduction, the effect on DNA damage response (DDR) proteins, cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), total antioxidant capacity (TAC), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and caspase activity were studied. PG and PC alter the DDR and may promote ATR-Chk1 and ATM-Chk2 pathways, respectively. Cellular oxidative stress induced by NNKOAc was mitigated by PG and PC through enhanced GPx expression and TAC. PG and PC suppressed the activation of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway (caspase 3 and 8) provoked by NNKOAc.

The study design was cross-sectional. Self-selected community-dwelling young adults (ages 18-29 years; n = 143) who regularly use cannabis completed an online survey. Results revealed that approximately 40% of the sample met the criteria for chronic pain, and pain relief was their primary motivation for use. There were no differences between groups with respect to frequency of use or estimated potency of their preferred strains; however, users with chronic pain reported using a wider variety of administration methods and a greater quantity of cannabis with each use. Users with chronic pain also reported more extensive histories of use, with younger age at initiation and longer duration of regular use. Despite riskier consumption patterns, there were no between-group differences in negative consequences owing to use after controlling for gender and educational status. On average, the total sample reported approximately 8 problems in the past 30 days owing to use. These findings suggest that chronic pain is commonly experienced among young adult cannabis users and pain relief is the primary motivation for users with pain. For some users, clinically significant chronic pain and pain-related interference persist despite heavy use. Cannabis users with and without chronic pain report experiencing several negative consequences owing to their use. PERSPECTIVE: This article compares motivations for cannabis use and describes differences in consumption patterns among a community sample of young adult users with and without chronic pain. This information may be useful for providers who assess and treat pain in young adults, particularly in settings that have legalized recreational use.",Encapsulated human mesenchymal stem cells (eMSCs) as a novel anti-cancer agent targeting breast cancer stem cells: Development of 3D primed therapeutic MSCs.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735730,The international journal of biochemistry & cell biology,2019 04 30,"Breast cancer is a leading cause of mortality in women across the globe. The major reason for its recurrence and high mortality is due to the presence of a drug refractory and self-renewing population of cells, the cancer stem cells (CSCs). Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have recently emerged as a promising cell-based therapeutic agent for the treatment of different cancer types. However, the anti-tumor effect of MSCs has been indicated to be substantially reduced by their in vivo tumor-trophic migration property and direct cell-to-cell integration with tumor stromal elements. To address this drawback, the present study uses a biomaterial, sodium alginate, for the encapsulation of MSCs from the perinatal tissue, Wharton's jelly (WJMSCs) into microbeads, to study the effect of WJMSCs beads on breast CSCs derived from two breast cancer cell lines, MDA-MB-231 and MCF7. Encapsulation with sodium alginate facilitated the prevention of direct cell-to-cell interaction and these microbeads provided a three-dimensional (3D) microenvironment for the encapsulated WJMSCs (eWJMSCs). Compared to two dimensional (2D) culture, eWJMSC increased proliferation of WJMSCs with an increase in pluripotency genes, epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), immune-modulation, and angiogenesis. Interestingly, the tumor invasion suppressor protein E-cadherin was highly expressed in eWJMSCs as shown by Western blot analysis. In addition, eWJMSCs had an increased secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines VEGF, TGF-β, TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-10 and -6, and IL-3β when compared to 2D culture. Treatment of CSCs with eWJMSCs reduced cell viability, inhibited migration, and exerted an anti-angiogenic effect. eWJMSCs treatment of CSCs increased caspase 3/7 activity, nitric oxide production, and reactive oxygen species production, suggesting its anti-tumorigenic activity. Gene expression analysis revealed that CSCs treated with eWJMSCs had a downregulation of pro-proliferation markers, drug transporters, epithelial-mesenchymal transition-associated markers, and angiogenesis related genes. The mode of anti-proliferative action of WJMSCs beads was possibly through inhibition of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway as indicated by the upregulation of the Wnt antagonists sFRP4 and DKK1. These data suggest that alginate-encapsulated WJMSCs could be an efficient cell contact-free system for developing stem cell-based therapies for CSCs.",Immune aging in diabetes and its implications in wound healing.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735729,"Clinical immunology (Orlando, Fla.)",2019 02 25,"Immune systems have evolved to recognize and eliminate pathogens and damaged cells. In humans, it is estimated to recognize 109 epitopes and natural selection ensures that clonally expanded cells replace unstimulated cells and overall immune cell numbers remain stationary. But, with age, it faces continuous repertoire restriction and concomitant accumulation of primed cells. Changes shaping the aging immune system have bitter consequences because, as inflammatory responses gain intensity and duration, tissue-damaging immunity and inflammatory disease arise. During inflammation, the glycolytic flux cannot cope with increasing ATP demands, limiting the immune response's extent. In diabetes, higher glucose availability stretches the glycolytic limit, dysregulating proteostasis and increasing T-cell expansion. Long-term hyperglycemia exerts an accumulating effect, leading to higher inflammatory cytokine levels and increased cytotoxic mediator secretion upon infection, a phenomenon known as diabetic chronic inflammation. Here we review the etiology of diabetic chronic inflammation and its consequences on wound healing.","MEIS2 gene is responsible for intellectual disability, cardiac defects and a distinct facial phenotype.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735726,European journal of medical genetics,2019 02 23,"Myeloid ecotropic insertion site 2 (MEIS2) gene, encoding a homeodomain-containing transcription factor, has been recently related to syndromic intellectual disability with cleft palate and cardiac defects.

Whole exome sequencing revealed a novel de novo nonsense mutation in the MEIS2 gene. This patient represents another reported case with a de novo MEIS2 point mutation and helps to characterize a distinct facial phenotype consisting in low anterior hairline, thin eyebrows, anteverted nares, hypoplastic alae nasi, and M-shape upper lip. Furthermore, these data confirm the role of this gene in cardiac, nervous system development and gastrointestinal function.",Plastid phylogenomic insights into the evolution of Caryophyllales.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735725,Molecular phylogenetics and evolution,2019 06 13,"The Caryophyllales includes 40 families and 12,500 species, representing a large and diverse clade of angiosperms. Collectively, members of the clade grow on all continents and in all terrestrial biomes and often occupy extreme habitats (e.g., xeric, salty). The order is characterized by many taxa with unusual adaptations including carnivory, halophytism, and multiple origins of C4 photosynthesis. However, deep phylogenetic relationships within the order have long been problematic due to putative rapid divergence. To resolve the deep-level relationships of Caryophyllales, we performed phylogenomic analyses of all 40 families of Caryophyllales. We time-calibrated the molecular phylogeny of this clade, and evaluated putative correlations among plastid structural changes and rates of molecular substitution. We recovered a well-resolved and well-supported phylogeny of the Caryophyllales that was largely congruent with previous estimates of this order. Our results provide improved support for the phylogenetic position of several key families within this clade. The crown age of Caryophyllales was estimated at ca. 114.4 million years ago (Ma), with periods of rapid divergence in the mid-Cretaceous. A strong, positive correlation between nucleotide substitution rate and plastid structural changes was detected. Our study highlights the importance of broad taxon sampling in phylogenomic inference and provides a firm basis for future investigations of molecular, morphological, and ecophysiological evolution in Caryophyllales.",Elite athletes have longer telomeres than sedentary subjects: A meta-analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735724,Experimental gerontology,2019 03 05,"The aim of this meta-analysis was to investigate the effects of high levels of physical activity (in elite athletes) and sedentary lifestyle on telomere length.

After study selection, nine articles were included in our meta-analysis. All of the included subjects were elite athletes (with experience in national or international competitions) or sedentary subjects, which served as the control group. The analysis showed that elite athletes (n = 306) had longer telomeres (P = 0.001) compared with the control group (n = 322). The difference in the standardized means was 0.91 (95% CI = 0.43-1.33; I2 83.4% P value for heterogeneity = 0.001), favoring the athlete group. The analysis of the funnel plot did not detect any risk of publication bias in the studies that reported differences in means.

The present study examined the tissue and subcellular distribution of FAM81A protein and its expression levels during development. Comparison of different organs indicates selective expression of FAM81A protein in brain. FAM81A is expressed late in development, with a post-natal gradual increase in brain levels that parallels the expression of PSD-95. Comparison of subcellular fractions from adult brain shows that the distribution of FAM81A protein is similar to that of PSD-95, with a drastic enrichment in the postsynaptic density fraction. Immuno-electron microscopy of adult brain tissue reveals specific immunogold labeling for FAM81A protein at postsynaptic densities in the forebrain. The label for FAM81A protein is concentrated at the cytoplasmic edge of the electron-dense core of the postsynaptic density, with a mean distance of ∼33 nm from the postsynaptic membrane. These observations firmly establish FAM81A protein as a component of the postsynaptic density in the adult brain, suggesting a role in synaptic function.",Cell-permeable p38 MAP kinase protects adult hippocampal neurons from cell death.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735722,Neuroscience letters,2019 05 30,"p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase (p38) is a member of the MAP kinase family. Previous reports using p38 chemical inhibitors have suggested that its activation contributes to hippocampal neuronal cell death rather than cell survival. In this study, we used both a cell-permeable p38 protein containing the HIV protein transduction domain (PTD) and cultured adult hippocampal neurons, which were differentiated from cultured adult hippocampal neural stem/progenitor cells (NPCs), to evaluate the direct function of p38 on adult hippocampal neurons. Our immunocytochemical experiments demonstrated that wild-type cell-permeable p38 protein prevents cell death of adult hippocampal neurons induced by a low glucose condition. Our findings indicate that cell-permeable p38 protein may be useful in preventing the degeneration of higher brain function occurring through hippocampal neuronal cell death, and furthermore, that the maintenance of intracellular p38 levels could be another therapeutic target for neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD).",Endocrine modulation of Brucella abortus-infected osteocytes function and osteoclastogenesis via modulation of RANKL/OPG.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735720,Microbes and infection,2019 02 22,"Osteoarticular brucellosis is the most frequent complication of active disease. A large amount of cells in bone are osteocytes. Since bone remodeling process is regulated by hormones we sought to study the effect of cortisol and DHEA in Brucella abortus-infected osteocytes. Cortisol treatment inhibited the expression of IL-6, TNF-α, MMP-2 and RANKL in B. abortus-infected osteocytes. DHEA could reverse the inhibitory effect of cortisol on MMP-2 production. B. abortus infection inhibited connexin 43 (Cx43) expression in osteocytes. This expression was increased when cortisol was incorporated during the infection and DHEA treatment partially reversed the effect of cortisol. Osteocytes-infected with B. abortus induced osteoclast's differentiation. Yet, the presence of cortisol, but not DHEA, during osteocyte infection inhibited osteoclastogenesis. Glucocorticoid receptor (GR) is implicated in the signaling of cortisol. Infection with B. abortus was able to increase GRα/β ratio. Levels of intracellular cortisol are not only dependent on GR expression but also a result of the activity of the isoenzymes 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11β-HSD)-1 (cortisone to cortisol conversion), 11β-HSD2 (cortisol to cortisone conversion). B. abortus infection increased 11β-HSD 1/2 ratio and cortisone mimicked the effect of cortisol. Our results indicated that cortisol and DHEA could modulate osteocyte responses during B. abortus infection.",Dentin matrix protein 1 correlates with the severity of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome and promotes hyper-permeability of endothelial cells infected by Hantaan virus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735719,Microbes and infection,2019 02 22,"Hantaviruses are the major causative agents of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in humans, which is characterized by increased capillary permeability. Dentin matrix protein 1 (DMP1) has been shown to degrade components of the basal membrane and interendothelial junctions via matrix metalloproteinase-9. To study the changes of serum DMP1 in HFRS, we determined the concentration of DMP1 using sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. We found that serum DMP1 concentrations increased significantly, and reached peak value during the oliguric phase and in the critical group in HFRS patients. Moreover, serum DMP1 concentrations were closely related to blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, cystatin C, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). We further explored the role of DMP1 in HTNV-infected human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) model. Data from immunocytochemistry showed that VEGF and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) promoted the expression of DMP1 on HTNV-infected HUVECs. Results from transwell assays demonstrated that the permeability of HUVECs increased significantly after HTNV infection with the addition of DMP1, VEGF, and TNF-α. This study suggests that elevated DMP1 concentrations may be associated with disease stage, severity, and the degree of acute kidney injury. DMP1 is involved in the regulation of capillary permeability in HFRS caused by hantavirus infection."

The assay showed a good linear relationship, and the limits of detection for this assay were 34.6 copies/μL and 61.2 copies/μL for PEDV and PCV3, respectively. The assay exhibited high repeatability and reproducibility, with intra-assay and inter-assay variation coefficients less than 2.0%. A clinical evaluation using intestinal tissue and fecal samples from piglets suffering from diarrhea at different pig farms in China revealed that the singular infection rates of PEDV and PCV3 were 43.94% (29/66) and 16.67% (11/66), respectively, while the co-infection rate of PCV3 with PEDV was 27.27% (18/66).

Fed-batch fermentation of Trichoderma strains for the production of low cost cellulase is carried out on complex media that has various soluble and insoluble substrates. The lack of direct estimation of biomass in the presence of insoluble substrates is one of the major concerns for controlling bioprocesses in industries. In this paper, a Multiphase Artificial Neural Network (MANN) based dynamic soft sensor is developed to predict the biomass concentration of Trichoderma during fed batch fermentation in the presence of insoluble substrates. The soft sensor has three Nonlinear Auto Regressive with eXogenous input (NARX) models to capture the complete dynamics of lag, log and stationary phases of the microbe. At different phases, a particular neural network model is triggered based on the period of operation. Each NARX model estimates biomass concentration using online measurements such as pH, substrate concentration and agitation speed. The predicted output of the proposed model and single ANN model are compared against real-time biomass sensor data. The results demonstrated indicate that the proposed MANN based soft sensor shows good performance with focus on the dynamic behavior of the bioreactor. Also, the developed model recursively predicts the biomass concentration with acceptable deviation with respect to realistic measurement. The results summarized could offer a new methodology in estimating fungal biomass accurately, thereby increasing the productivity of cellulase in industries.",Toxicology study of long-term administration of rhKGF-2 eye drops on rabbit corneas.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735698,Regulatory toxicology and pharmacology : RTP,2019 05 20,"Keratinocyte growth factor -2 promotes corneal repair. Its mechanism of action involves regulating regeneration and migration of corneal cells, as well as activating corneal limbal stem cells. However, KGF-2 being a carcinogenic growth factor and its potential adverse effect in over dosage long-term treatment had not yet been reported. In this study, we used New Zealand white rabbits to study possible toxic effects of ocular administration of recombinant human keratinocyte growth factor-2 eye drops. Animals in the medium- and high-dose groups had some ocular irritant reactions during the course of drug administration; however this reaction was harmless to the cornea and it ended up when administration was stopped. Serum biochemistries were largely unaffected by treatment. Pathological examinations were unremarkable. We found that over-dosed administration of these eye drops caused some ocular irritation, but this irritant reaction was harmless to the eye, and it reversed after the drug was stopped. There were no apparent systemic effects of the drug.",ETV5 regulates GOAT/ghrelin system in an mTORC1-dependent manner.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735697,Molecular and cellular endocrinology,2019 05 21,"Ghrelin, a 28 amino acid peptide hormone, regulates multiple important metabolic functions. Its acylation by ghrelin-O-acyl-transferase enzyme (GOAT) is required for binding to and activating its receptor, the growth hormone secretagogue receptor 1a. Mechanism underlying the regulation of GOAT and acyl ghrelin remains unclear. The present study demonstrated that ETV5 could transactivate GOAT promoter region and increase its expression, leading to subsequent increase in the production of acyl ghrelin. mTORC1 modulated ETV5 expression levels, likely via altering its protein stability, in the murine hypothalamic CLU122 cells and in mice. Moreover, ETV5 mediated the effects of mTORC1 signaling on the expression level of acyl ghrelin. Our study suggests a novel mTORC1-ETV5-GOAT/ghrelin axis in the regulation of ghrelin system.

Using two sources of case data from dengue epidemics in Kampong Cham (Cambodia), models are estimated in the bayesian framework, with Markov Chain Monte Carlo and Particle Markov Chain Monte Carlo. We highlight the advantages and drawbacks of the different formulations in a practical setting.

Comparisons are made between the resulting dynamics of the nonlocal model with these kernels for the same range of nonlocal interaction. A linear stability analysis is performed for both the kernels to derive Turing and spatial-Hopf bifurcation conditions. In general, Turing bifurcation curves are different for the two kernels and the same is true for spatial-Hopf bifurcation curves. This results in different dynamics for the two kernels for some parameter values. However, for a fixed range of nonlocal interaction, the dynamics of the model with these two kernels are almost similar for most of the parameter values explored. Increase in the range of nonlocal interaction up to a certain value stabilizes the system dynamics, and then, it destabilizes. Extensive numerical simulations are performed to illustrate the system dynamics.",Multiplicative noise is beneficial for the transmission of sensory signals in simple neuron models.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735693,Bio Systems,2019 06 06,"We study simple integrate-and-fire type models with multiplicative noise and consider the transmission of a weak and slow signal, i.e. a signal that evokes a small modulation of the instantaneous firing rate on time scales that are much larger than the membrane time scale and the mean interspike interval. The specific question of interest is whether and how the state-dependence of the noise can be optimized with respect to information transmission. First, in a simple model in which the noise intensity varies linearly with the state variable, we show analytically that multiplicative fluctuations may benefit the signal transfer and we elucidate the mechanism for this improvement. In a conductance-based integrate-and-fire model with synaptically filtered shot-noise input, we show by means of extended numerical simulations that also in a biophysically more relevant situation, multiplicative noise can enhance the signal-to-noise ratio. Our results shed light on a so far unexplored aspect of stochastic signal transmission in neural systems.","Respiratory depression and brain hypoxia induced by opioid drugs: Morphine, oxycodone, heroin, and fentanyl.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735692,Neuropharmacology,2019 05 21,"Opioid drugs are important tools to alleviate pain of different origins, but they have strong addictive potential and their abuse at higher doses often results in serious health complications. Respiratory depression that leads to brain hypoxia is perhaps the most dangerous symptom of acute intoxication with opioids, and it could result in lethality. The development of substrate-specific sensors coupled with amperometry made it possible to directly evaluate physiological and drug-induced fluctuations in brain oxygen levels in awake, freely-moving rats. The goal of this review paper is to consider changes in brain oxygen levels induced by several opioid drugs (heroin, fentanyl, oxycodone, morphine). While some of these drugs are widely used in clinical practice, they all are abused, often at doses exceeding the clinical range and often resulting in serious health complications. First, we consider some basic knowledge regarding brain oxygen, its physiological fluctuations, and mechanisms involved in regulating its entry into brain tissue. Then, we present and discuss data on brain oxygen changes induced by each opioid drug within a wide range of doses, from low, behaviorally relevant, to high, likely to be self-administered by drug users. These data allowed us to compare the effects of these drugs on brain oxygen in terms of their potency, time-course, and their potential danger when used at high doses via rapid-onset administration routes. While most data discussed in this work were obtained in rats, we believe that these data have clear human relevance in addressing the alarming rise in lethality associated with the opioid abuse.",Oxycodone-like discriminative stimulus effects of fentanyl-related emerging drugs of abuse in mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735691,Neuropharmacology,2019 05 21,"Fentanyl and its structurally related compounds have emerged as the most significant contributors to opioid overdose fatalities in recent years. While there is abundant information about the pharmacological effects of fentanyl, far less is known of its more recently abused analogs. The objective of this study was to determine whether fentanyl and several fentanyl-related substances would engender oxycodone-like responding in a mouse model of oxycodone discrimination. Oxycodone was selected as the training drug due to its high selectivity for mu opioid receptors. Compounds that elicited oxycodone-like responding in this procedure would likely evoke overlapping subjective experiences."

Cardio- and skeletal myopathies have been reported in children exposed to antiretroviral drugs prenatally. These conditions have also been described in perturbed placental transfer of l-carnitine, an essential co-factor in fatty acid oxidation. Due to limited fetal and placental synthesis, carnitine supply is maintained through the placental carnitine uptake from maternal blood by the organic cation/carnitine transporters OCTN1 and OCTN2 (SLC22A4 and SLC22A5, respectively). The aim of our study was to investigate potential inhibition of placental carnitine uptake by a broad range of antiretroviral drugs comprising nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (lamivudine, zidovudine, abacavir, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (rilpivirine, efavirenz, etravirine), protease inhibitors (ritonavir, lopinavir, atazanavir, saquinavir, tipranavir), integrase inhibitors (raltegravir, dolutegravir, elvitegravir) and viral entry inhibitor, maraviroc. Studies in choriocarcinoma BeWo cells and human placenta-derived models confirmed predominant expression and function of OCTN2 above OCTN1 in l-carnitine transport. Subsequent screenings in BeWo cells and isolated MVM vesicles revealed seven antiretroviral drugs as inhibitors of the Na+-dependent l-carnitine uptake, corresponding to OCTN2. Ritonavir, saquinavir and elvitegravir showed the highest inhibitory potential which was further confirmed for ritonavir and saquinavir in placental fresh villous fragments. Our data indicate possible impairment in placental and fetal supply of l-carnitine with ritonavir and saquinavir, while suggesting retained placental carnitine transport with the other antiretroviral drugs.",An in vitro study of NF-κB factors cooperatively in regulation of Drosophila melanogaster antimicrobial peptide genes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735676,Developmental and comparative immunology,2019 03 26,"An important innate immune response in Drosophila melanogaster is the production of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). Expression of AMP genes is mediated by the Toll and immune deficiency (IMD) pathways via NF-κB transcription factors Dorsal, DIF and Relish. Dorsal and DIF act downstream of the Toll pathway, whereas Relish acts in the IMD pathway. Dorsal and DIF are held inactive in the cytoplasm by the IκB protein Cactus, while Relish contains an IκB-like inhibitory domain at the C-terminus. NF-κB factors normally form homodimers and heterodimers to regulate gene expression, but formation of heterodimers between Relish and DIF or Dorsal and the specificity and activity of the three NF-κB homodimers and heterodimers are not well understood. In this study, we compared the activity of Rel homology domains (RHDs) of Dorsal, DIF and Relish in activation of Drosophila AMP gene promoters, demonstrated that Relish-RHD (Rel-RHD) interacted with both Dorsal-RHD and DIF-RHD, Relish-N interacted with DIF and Dorsal, and overexpression of individual RHD and co-expression of any two RHDs activated the activity of AMP gene promoters to various levels, suggesting formation of homodimers and heterodimers among Dorsal, DIF and Relish. Rel-RHD homodimers were stronger activators than heterodimers of Rel-RHD with either DIF-RHD or Dorsal-RHD, while DIF-RHD-Dorsal-RHD heterodimers were stronger activators than either DIF-RHD or Dorsal-RHD homodimers in activation of AMP gene promoters. We also identified the nucleotides at the 6th and 8th positions of the 3' half-sites of the κB motifs that are important for the specificity and activity of NF-κB transcription factors.","Same words, different structures: An fMRI investigation of argument relations and the angular gyrus.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735675,Neuropsychologia,2019 05 19,"In fMRI, increased activation for combinatorial syntactic and semantic processing is typically observed in a set of left hemisphere brain areas: the angular gyrus (AG), the anterior temporal lobe (ATL), the posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS), and the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). Recent work has suggested that semantic combination is supported by the ATL and the AG, with a division of labor in which AG is involved in event concepts and ATL is involved in encoding conceptual features of entities and/or more general forms of semantic combination. The current fMRI study was designed to refine hypotheses about the angular gyrus processes in question. In particular, we ask whether the AG supports the computation of argument structure (a linguistic notion that depends on a verb taking other phrases as arguments) or the computation of event concepts more broadly. To distinguish these possibilities we used a novel, lexically-matched contrast: noun phrases (NP) (the frightened boy) and verb phrases (VP) (frightened the boy), where VPs contained argument structure, denoting an event and assigning a thematic role to its argument, and NPs did not, denoting only a semantically enriched entity. Results showed that while many regions showed increased activity for NPs and VPs relative to unstructured word lists (AG, ATL, pSTS, anterior IFG), replicating evidence of their involvement in combinatorial processing, neither AG or ATL showed differences in activation between the VP and NP conditions. These results suggest that increased AG activity does not reflect the computation of argument structure per se, but are compatible with a view in which the AG represents event information denoted by words such as frightened independent of their grammatical context. By contrast, pSTS and posterior IFG did show increased activation for the VPs relative to NPs. We suggest that these effects may reflect differences in syntactic processing and working memory engaged by different structural relations.",Responses to positive and aversive stimuli in estrous female rats housed in a seminatural environment: Effects of yohimbine and chlordiazepoxide.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735674,"Pharmacology, biochemistry, and behavior",2019 03 26,"The behavioral effects of putative anxiolytic and anxiogenic drugs are usually evaluated in highly standardized tests. Here, we determined the effects of such drugs in rats housed in mixed sex groups in a seminatural environment. Sexually receptive female Wistar rats were treated with either the anxiolytic drug chlordiazepoxide (2 mg/kg), the anxiogenic drug yohimbine (1 mg/kg), or saline (1 ml/kg). Different emotional challenges eliciting purportedly positive affect (lavender odor, Mozart's music, chocolate flavored food) or negative affect (white noise, fox odor) were then introduced into the seminatural environment. A co-occurrence analysis revealed that music was rather aversive to the rats, as were white noise and fox odor. Lavender and chocolate exposure decreased classical indicators of fear. White noise suppressed sexual behaviors and caused avoidance of the open area. Yohimbine increased sexual receptivity during lavender exposure, decreased the latency to flee the white noise, and increased self-grooming regardless of the emotional challenge. Chlordiazepoxide was effective only during exposure to white noise, and increased the frequency of hiding alone. The modest effects of the drugs in the seminatural environment may be the result of social buffering and rats experiencing a high degree of controllability over their environment.",A novel type of prolactin expressed in the bullfrog pituitary specifically during the larval period.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735673,General and comparative endocrinology,2019 05 17,"Prolactin (PRL) is one of the major hormones that control amphibian metamorphosis. Recently, a PRL (PRL1B) gene that is different from the known PRL (PRL1A) gene has been found in the genomes of several amphibian species. In order to ascertain whether the PRL1B gene is expressed in the bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana) pituitary, cloning of cDNA encoding PRL1B in the pituitary of the premetamorphic bullfrog tadpole was attempted. The bullfrog PRL1B amino acid sequence predicted from the obtained cDNA showed 62% identity with those of Xenopus PRL1Bs that have been presumed from the genome sequences, whereas the sequence identity between bullfrog PRL1A and PRL1B was 48%. A molecular phylogenetic tree showed that bullfrog PRL1B is most appropriately grouped with amphibian PRL1Bs. Quantitative PCR analysis revealed that the mRNA expression levels of bullfrog PRL1B in the pituitary were high during pre- and prometamorphosis, sharply declined at metamorphic climax and became undetectable after metamorphosis. In contrast, PRL1A mRNA levels were relatively low during pre- and prometamorphosis, rose at climax and remained high after metamorphosis. Immunohistochemical study using antibodies against partial peptides of PRL1A and PRL1B revealed that most of the PRL1A- and PRL1B-immunoreactive cells in the larval pituitary were distributed separately, but that some of the cells immunoreactive with both antibodies were also present. Western blot analysis with the larval pituitary extract indicated that PRL1B-immunoreactive band appeared at the position of molecular weight ca. 22.1 kDa and PRL1A-immunoreactive band at the position of ca. 22.8 kDa. The results obtained in this experiment suggest the possibility that PRL1B plays as-yet-unknown role(s) during the pre-climactic period of metamorphosis. This is the first report on the existence of PRL1B as a protein in the amphibian larval pituitary.","Variation in metabolic factors and gonadal, pituitary, thyroid, and adrenal hormones in association with musth in African and Asian elephant bulls.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735672,General and comparative endocrinology,2019 05 17,"Longitudinal analyses of serum testosterone, luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), prolactin, glucose, insulin, triglycerides, cholesterol, total and free thyroxine (T4), total triiodothyronine (T3), thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), and cortisol were conducted to investigate pituitary, metabolic, and adrenal changes related to testicular function and musth status in zoo-housed elephant bulls. Blood samples were collected twice a month for 12 months from 14 African and 12 Asian bulls at 17 facilities in North America. Building on previous studies, our results show that musth is associated with increased testosterone, LH, FSH, and cortisol secretion, and a decrease in thyroid hormone (total and free T4) production. In addition, glucose and triglycerides were higher during musth than non-musth periods, indicative of altered sugar and fat metabolism. There were significant differences associated with age for LH, FSH and testosterone, all increasing, whereas the glucose-to-insulin ratio (G:I) decreased with age. A species comparison found African and Asian elephants differed in measures of insulin, prolactin, cholesterol and the G:I. Across all hormones, high inter-individual variability was observed, making it difficult to define a general musth endocrine profile or to assess musth status from single samples. These results highlight the need for facilities hosting bulls to closely and consistently monitor each individual from an early age and throughout musth and non-musth periods to determine the pattern for each male.",Investigation of the utility of feces and hair as non-invasive measures of glucocorticoids in wild black-tailed prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735671,General and comparative endocrinology,2019 05 03,"Non-invasive measures of glucocorticoid (GC) hormones and their metabolites, particularly in feces and hair, are gaining popularity as wildlife management tools, but species-specific validations of these tools remain rare. We report the results of a validation on black-tailed prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus), a highly social engineer of the grasslands ecosystem that has experienced recent population declines. We captured adult female prairie dogs and brought them into temporary captivity to conduct an adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation test, assessing the relationship between plasma GC and fecal glucocorticoid metabolite (FGM) levels following a single injection of a low (4 IU/kg) or high dose (12 IU/kg) of ACTH, compared to a single injection of saline. We also gave repeated injections of ACTH to adult females to assess whether this would result in an increase of hair cortisol concentrations, compared with control individuals repeatedly injected with saline. A single injection of ACTH at either low or high dose peaked plasma cortisol levels after 30 min, and thereafter the cortisol levels declined until 120 min, where they returned to pre-treatment levels comparable to those of the saline injected group. Despite the significant elevation of plasma cortisol in the treatment groups following ACTH injection, the elevation of FGM levels in the treatment groups were not significantly different from those in the control group over the following 12 h. Repeated injection of a high dose of ACTH failed to increase hair cortisol concentration in treatment animals. Instead, hair cortisol levels remained comparable to the pre-treatment mean, despite an increase in post-treatment hair cortisol levels seen in the saline-injected group. The magnitude of increase in the saline control group was comparable to natural seasonal variation seen in unmanipulated individuals. These results highlight that while measurement of GCs and their metabolites in feces and hair are potentially valuable conservation tools for black-tailed prairie dogs, further validation work is required before these matrices can be to real-world conservation applications.","Experimental increase in temperature affects eggshell thickness, and not egg mass, eggshell spottiness or egg composition in the great tit (Parus major).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735670,General and comparative endocrinology,2019 05 03,"Phenotypic effects of global warming have been documented in many different taxa. However, the importance of transgenerational phenotypic plasticity in these adaptations are seldom studied. In birds, temperature could affect egg characteristics. Higher temperatures during egg-laying may reduce maintenance costs for females and allow a higher investment in reproduction. Yet, females may also use temperatures as a cue for the risk of mismatch latter in the season. Thus, higher temperatures may be correlated to an acceleration of embryonic development (e.g. via hormonal manipulation). We performed an experiment in which night-time temperature was increased in the nestbox by approximately 1 °C throughout the entire laying period in great tits (Parus major). We collected one pre-treatment egg (beginning of the laying sequence) and one post-treatment egg (end of the laying sequence). Egg content (yolk androgens and lysozymes in the albumen), eggshell coloration, eggshell mass, egg mass, and shape were not affected by the treatment. However, last-laid eggs in clutches from control nestboxes had a thicker eggshell than last-laid eggs from heated nestboxes, suggesting a putative slight decrease of maternal investment with the experimental increase of temperature. We also observed effects of the laying sequence on egg characteristics. Eggs that were laid late in the laying sequence were heavier, larger, had larger spots and higher yolk androgens than eggs laid earlier. Lysozyme concentration decrease with the laying sequence in late clutches only. Thus, effects of temperature may also change with the laying sequence and it would be interesting in the future to tests the effects on first-laid eggs.",Vaginal Ureaplasma parvum serovars and spontaneous preterm birth.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735669,American journal of obstetrics and gynecology,2019 06 01,"Ureaplasma species (spp) are the bacteria most often isolated from the amniotic cavity of women with preterm labor or preterm premature rupture of membranes; thus, the link between intrauterine Ureaplasma spp infection and adverse pregnancy outcome clearly is established.

However, because of the high frequency of vaginal Ureaplasma spp colonization during pregnancy, additional risk factors are needed to select a group of women who might benefit from treatment.",Factors that affect ultrasound-determined labor progress in women undergoing induction of labor.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735668,American journal of obstetrics and gynecology,2019 06 01,"The traditional approach to the assessment of labor progress is by digital vaginal examination; however, it is subjective and imprecise.

Methyl-CpG binding domain protein 2 (MBD2) is known to act as an epigenetic modulator in various types of tumors; however, the role of MBD2 in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) remains unclear. Herein, we demonstrated the down-regulation of MBD2 in LUAD compared with adjacent nontumor tissues. The down-regulation of MBD2 in LUAD was correlated with metastasis and poor survival. In addition, MBD2 inhibited tumor metastasis by maintaining the expression of the miR-200s, which suppressed the invasive properties of tumors. Also, MBD2 positively correlated with 5-hydroxymethylcytosine content in the promoter of miR-200s. The conventional view is that MBD2 acts as a transcriptional suppressor. However, the data revealed that MBD2 may act as a transcriptional activator by recruiting 10 to 11 translocation 1 (TET1) and forming a chromatin-remodeling complex. The MBD2-TET1 complex locates to the TET1 promoter and removes the methyl residues in this region, thereby activating TET1 transcription. TET1 also acted as a tumor suppressor in LUAD. Taken together, the data demonstrate the correlation between MBD2, miR-200s, and TET1, and tumor suppressive effect of MBD2 through up-regulation of TET1 and the miR-200s.","Macrophage-Mediated Phagocytosis and Dissolution of Amyloid-Like Fibrils in Mice, Monitored by Optical Imaging.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735627,The American journal of pathology,2019 06 10,"Light chain-associated amyloidosis is characterized by the extracellular deposition of amyloid fibrils in abdominothoracic organs, skin, soft tissue, and peripheral nerves. Phagocytic cells of the innate immune system appear to be ineffective at clearing the material; however, human light chain amyloid extract, injected subcutaneously into mice, is rapidly cleared in a process that requires neutrophil activity. To better elucidate the phagocytosis of light chain fibrils, a potential method of cell-mediated dissolution, amyloid-like fibrils were labeled with the pH-sensitive dye pHrodo red and a near infrared fluorophore. After injecting this material subcutaneously in mice, optical imaging was used to quantitatively monitor phagocytosis and dissolution of fibrils concurrently. Histologic evaluation of the residual fibril masses revealed the presence of CD68+, F4/80+, ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1- macrophages containing Congo red-stained fibrils as well as neutrophil-associated proteins with no evidence of intact neutrophils. These data suggest an early infiltration of neutrophils, followed by extensive phagocytosis of the light chain fibrils by macrophages, leading to dissolution of the mass. Optical imaging of this novel murine model, coupled with histologic evaluation, can be used to study the cellular mechanisms underlying dissolution of synthetic amyloid-like fibrils and human amyloid extracts. In addition, it may serve as a test bed to evaluate investigational opsonizing agents that might serve as therapeutic agents for light chain-associated amyloidosis.",Temperature dependent self-organization of DMPC membranes promoted by intermediate amounts of the saponin aescin.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735626,Biochimica et biophysica acta. Biomembranes,2019 03 27,"The plant-derived biosurfactant aescin is naturally present in many plants and is used for treatment of disorders such as varicose veins and inflammation of veins. The hemolytic activity of this saponin is attributed to its interaction with cholesterol in the red blood cell membrane. This work investigates the phase and aggregation behavior of saponin-containing model membranes consisting of the phospholipid 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DMPC). The aescin concentrations studied range from 1 mol% to 7 mol% with respect to the total lipid content. The methods of choice to elucidate the structural picture are small-angle scattering of X-rays (SAXS) and neutrons (SANS) and cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM). SANS and SAXS revealed that at lower aescin contents vesicular structures are conserved and vesicles tend to aggregate already at aescin contents of around 1 mol%. Aggregation and vesicle deformation effects are found to be stronger when the phospholipids are in the L [Formula: see text] phase. With increasing aescin content, mixed structures, i.e. aggregated and deformed vesicles and solubilized bilayer fragments, are present. This was proven for a sample with 4 mol% aescin by cryo-TEM. An increasing aescin amount leads to membrane decomposition and free standing bilayers which tend to build stacks at high temperature. These stacks are characterized by SAXS using the modified Caillé theory. Analyses and model dependent fitting reveal formation of well-defined structures beginning at 7 mol% aescin.","Associations Between Spontaneous Swallowing Frequency at Admission, Dysphagia, and Stroke-Related Outcomes in Acute Care.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735625,Archives of physical medicine and rehabilitation,2019 03 17,"To expand the scope of prior spontaneous swallowing frequency analysis (SFA) studies, by evaluating the role of SFA in dysphagia-and stroke-related outcomes at acute stroke discharge.",Geriatric Rehabilitation Should Not Be an Oxymoron: A Path Forward.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735624,Archives of physical medicine and rehabilitation,2019 04 28,"Older adults are the fastest growing segment of our population and contribute greatly to the high costs of health care. The primary concern among older adults seeking health care is maintaining or improving functional independence.

We describe 3 steps that can be implemented at an organizational or individual level to bridge the fields of geriatric medicine and rehabilitation, allowing them to better serve older patients. These include (1) recognizing the interwoven concepts of multimorbidity, function, and frailty; (2) communicating with a common language; and (3) synthesizing our knowledge from both fields.","Current Resources for Evidence-Based Practice, March 2019.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735623,"Journal of obstetric, gynecologic, and neonatal nursing : JOGNN",2019 03 11,A review of new resources to support the provision of evidence-based care for women and infants.,Role of Different Receptor-Surface Binding Modes in the Morphological and Electrochemical Properties of Peptide-Nucleic-Acid-Based Sensing Platforms.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735621,Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids,2019 03 05,"Label-free detection of charged biomolecules, such as DNA, has experienced an increase in research activity in recent years, mainly to obviate the need for elaborate and expensive pretreatments for labeling target biomolecules. A promising label-free approach is based on the detection of changes in the electrical surface potential on biofunctionalized silicon field-effect devices. These devices require a reliable and selective immobilization of charged biomolecules on the device surface. In this work, self-assembled monolayers of phosphonic acids are used to prepare organic interfaces with a high density of peptide nucleic acid (PNA) bioreceptors, which are a synthetic analogue to DNA, covalently bound either in a multidentate (∥PNA) or monodentate (⊥PNA) fashion to the underlying silicon native oxide surface. The impact of the PNA bioreceptor orientation on the sensing platform's surface properties is characterized in detail by water contact angle measurements, atomic force microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Our results suggest that the multidentate binding of the bioreceptor via attachment groups at the γ-points along the PNA backbone leads to the formation of an extended, protruding, and netlike three-dimensional metastructure. Typical ""mesh"" sizes are on the order of 8 ± 2.5 nm in diameter, with no preferential spatial orientation relative to the underlying surface. Contrarily, the monodentate binding provides a spatially more oriented metastructure comprising cylindrical features, of a typical size of 62 ± 23 × 12 ± 2 nm2. Additional cyclic voltammetry measurements in a redox buffer solution containing a small and highly mobile Ru-based complex reveal strikingly different insulating properties (ion diffusion kinetics) of these two PNA systems. Investigation by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy confirms that the binding mode has a significant impact on the electrochemical properties of the functional PNA layers represented by detectable changes of the conductance and capacitance of the underlying silicon substrate in the range of 30-50% depending on the surface organization of the bioreceptors in different bias potential regimes.",N-C Axially Chiral Compounds with an ortho-Fluoro Substituent and Steric Discrimination between Hydrogen and Fluorine Atoms Based on a Diastereoselective Model Reaction.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735620,The Journal of organic chemistry,2019 03 15,"The fluorine atom is the second smallest atom; nevertheless, the ortho-fluoro group may lead to stable N-aryl atropisomers when the steric demand of the flanking substituents is large enough. 2-Alkyl-3-(2-fluorophenyl)quinazolin-4-ones and 3-(2-fluorophenyl)-4-methylthiazoline-2-thione were found to be the first N-aryl axially chiral compounds bearing an ortho-fluoro group whose enantiomers were isolated at ambient temperature. The reaction of alkyl halides with the anionic species prepared from 2-ethyl-3-(2-fluorophenyl)quinazolin-4-one presenting an N-C axial chirality provided a model reaction for quantitative evaluation of the steric discrimination (slight difference of steric factor) between hydrogen and fluorine atoms. In the case of low steric demand (allylation reaction) no diastereoselectivity was detected, while in the case of high steric demand (isopropylation reaction) the diastereoselectivity became significant."

However, as little information is known on plant enzymes responsible for cAMP production/degradation, studies of cAMP functions have relied, to date, on non-specific pharmacological approaches. We therefore developed a more reliable approach, producing transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana lines overexpressing the 'cAMP-sponge' (cAS), a genetic tool that specifically buffers cAMP levels. In response to an avirulent strain of Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato (PstAvrB), cAS plants showed a higher bacterial growth and a reduced hypersensitive cell death in comparison with wild-type (WT) plants. The low cAMP availability after pathogen infection delayed cytosolic calcium elevation, as well as hydrogen peroxide increase and induction of redox systems. The proteomic analysis, performed 24 h post-infection, indicated that a core of 49 proteins was modulated in both genotypes, while 16 and 42 proteins were uniquely modulated in WT and cAS lines, respectively. The involvement of these proteins in the impairment of defence response in cAS plants is discussed in this paper. Moreover, in silico analysis revealed that the promoter regions of the genes coding for proteins uniquely accumulating in WT plants shared the CGCG motif, a target of the calcium-calmodulin-binding transcription factor AtSR1 (Arabidopsis thaliana signal responsive1). Therefore, following pathogen perception, the low free cAMP content, altering timing and levels of defence signals, and likely acting in part through the mis-regulation of AtSR1 activity, affected the speed and strength of the immune response.",The impact of a prospective 4-year longitudinal school intervention for improving oral health and oral health inequalities in primary schoolchildren in Flanders-Belgium.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735605,International journal of paediatric dentistry,2019 02 27,Oral diseases and socio-economic inequalities in children are a persisting problem.,Comparison of 10-year graft failure rates after induction with basiliximab or anti-thymocyte globulin in pediatric heart transplant recipients-The influence of race.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735604,Pediatric transplantation,2019 02 08,"The impact of induction therapy in pediatric heart transplantation has been uncertain.

Using Chlamydomonas reinhardtii as a model system, we found that in vivo the chloroplast chaperonin consists of CPN60α, CPN60β1 and CPN60β2 and the co-chaperonin of the three subunits CPN20, CPN11 and CPN23. In Escherichia coli, CPN20 homo-oligomers and all possible other chloroplast co-chaperonin hetero-oligomers are functional, but only that consisting of CPN11/20/23-CPN60αβ1β2 can fully replace GroES/GroEL under stringent stress conditions. Endogenous CPN60 was purified and its stoichiometry was determined to be 6:2:6 for CPN60α:CPN60β1:CPN60β2. The cryo-EM structures of endogenous CPN60αβ1β2/ADP and CPN60αβ1β2/co-chaperonin/ADP were solved at resolutions of 4.06 and 3.82 Å, respectively. In both hetero-oligomeric complexes the chaperonin subunits within each ring are highly symmetric. Through hetero-oligomerization, the chloroplast co-chaperonin CPN11/20/23 forms seven GroES-like domains, which symmetrically interact with CPN60αβ1β2. Our structure also reveals an uneven distribution of roof-forming domains in the dome-shaped CPN11/20/23 co-chaperonin and potentially diversified surface properties in the folding cavity of the CPN60αβ1β2 chaperonin that might enable the chloroplast chaperonin system to assist in the folding of specific substrates.",A comparison of post-transplant renal function in pre-emptive and post-dialysis pediatric kidney transplant recipients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735602,Pediatric transplantation,2019 02 08,"Little is known regarding post-transplant renal function following pediatric pre-emptive KT.

Here, we investigated whether the vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is involved in regulating the responsiveness of hippocampal neurons in rats under chronic restraint stress (CRS). c-Fos protein signals were detected 2 hr after VNS in 5-HT1A receptor-positive neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) as well as in the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS). Chronic VNS was performed on a daily basis for 2 weeks using an implanted microelectrode in rats that had undergone CRS for 2 weeks. We found that the levels of both 5-HT1B receptors and phospho-Erk1/2 were decreased in parallel in the hippocampal neurons of CRS animals and then increased to the baseline levels by chronic VNS. Hippocampal induction of 5-HT1B receptors and phospho-Erk1/2 by VNS was diminished after the injection of 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (5,7-DHT), a neurotoxin of serotonergic neurons, into the DRN. Hippocampal production of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) was also upregulated by VNS, but the treatment of 5,7-DHT abrogated the effects of VNS on BDNF induction. VNS in CRS animals improved the behavioral scores in forced swimming test (FST) compared to sham-stimulated control. Our results suggest that VNS-mediated serotonergic input via 5-HT1B receptors into the hippocampal neurons may activate BDNF pathway and improve depressive-like behaviors in CRS animals.",Simultaneous determination of three organotin pesticides in fruits and vegetables by high-performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735598,Rapid communications in mass spectrometry : RCM,2019 04 12,"The presence of organotins in the environment affects food safety, making it important to monitor the levels of organotin pesticides (OTPs) in fruit and vegetable samples.","A Photoswitchable Agonist for the Histamine H3 Receptor, a Prototypic Family A G-Protein-Coupled Receptor.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735597,Angewandte Chemie (International ed. in English),2019 03 19,"Spatiotemporal control over biochemical signaling processes involving G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) is highly desired for dissecting their complex intracellular signaling.

Genome analysis of the P. fijiensis PKS8-1 gene identified it as part of a gene cluster including genes encoding two transcription factors, a regulatory protein, a glyoxylase/beta-lactamase-like protein, an MFS transporter, a cytochrome P450, two aldo/keto reductases, a dehydrogenase, and a decarboxylase. Genome analysis of the related pathogens Pseudocercospora musae, Pseudocercospora eumusae, and Pseudocercospora pini-densiflorae, identified orthologous clusters containing a nearly identical combination of genes. Phylogenetic analysis of PKS8-1 identified homology to PKS proteins in the monodictyphenone and cladofulvin pathways in Aspergillus nidulans and Cladosporium fulvum, respectively. Analysis of clustered genes showed that the PKS8-1 cluster shares genes for enzymes involved in the production of the emodin intermediate in the monodictyphenone and cladofulvin pathways, but differs in many genes, suggesting production of a different metabolic product. Time course analysis of gene expression in infected banana showed up-regulation of PKS8-1 and four of eight clustered genes as early as 2 weeks post-inoculation and remaining high through 9 weeks. Overexpression of the pathway through constitutive expression of an aflR-like transcription factor gene in the cluster resulted in increased expression in culture of PKS8-1 as well as the four clustered genes that are up-regulated in infected plants. No differences were seen in timing or severity of disease symptoms with the overexpression strains relative to controls, however gene expression analysis showed no difference in expression in planta by an overexpression strain relative to controls. Thus constitutive expression of the aflR-like gene is not sufficient to upregulate the pathway above normal expression in planta. Pathway expression during all phases of disease development and conservation of the pathway in related Pseudocercospora species support a role for this pathway in disease.",Inadequate maternal weight gain in the third trimester increases the risk of intrauterine growth restriction in rural Bangladesh.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735555,PloS one,2019 02 24,To estimate the effect of inadequate maternal weight gain in the third trimester on the risk of intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) in rural Bangladesh.,Prevention of tooth extraction-triggered bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaws with basic fibroblast growth factor: An experimental study in rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735554,PloS one,2019 02 24,"Osteonecrosis of the jaw induced by administration of bisphosphonates (BPs), BP-related osteonecrosis (BRONJ), typically develops after tooth extraction and is medically challenging. As BPs inhibit oral mucosal cell growth, we hypothesized that suppression of the wound healing-inhibiting effects could prevent BRONJ onset after tooth extraction. Since basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) promotes wound healing, but has a short half-life, we examined whether the initiation of BRONJ could be prevented by applying a bFGF-containing gelatin hydrogel over the extraction sockets of BRONJ model rats. Forty-three rats, received two intravenous injections of zoledronic acid 60 μg/kg, once per week for a period of 2 weeks, underwent extraction of a unilateral lower first molar. The rats here were randomly assigned to the bFGF group (n = 15 rats, gelatin hydrogel sheets with incorporated bFGF applied over the sockets); the phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) group (n = 14 rats, gelatin hydrogel sheets without bFGF applied over the sockets); or the control group (n = 14 rats, nothing applied over the sockets). One rat in the bFGF group was sacrificed immediately after tooth extraction. Twenty-one rats were sacrificed at 3 weeks, and the remaining 21 rats were sacrificed at 8 weeks after tooth extractions. The harvested mandibles were analyzed using micro-computed tomography and sections were evaluated qualitatively for mucosal disruption and osteonecrosis. The incidence of osteonecrosis at 8 weeks after tooth extraction was 0% in the bFGF group, 100% in the PBS group, and 85.7% in the control group. The frequency of complete coverage of the extraction socket by mucosal tissue was significantly greater in the bFGF group than in the other groups. These results suggest that application of bFGF in the extraction socket promoted socket healing, which prevented BRONJ development. The growth-stimulating effects of bFGF may have offset the inhibition of wound healing by BP.",Defining the representativeness heuristic in trauma triage: A retrospective observational cohort study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735553,PloS one,2019 06 10,"Under-triage of severely injured patients presenting to non-trauma centers (failure to transfer to a trauma center) remains problematic despite quality improvement efforts.

The results are as follows: (1) Both the MIIT universities and universities nationwide in China have increased their international academic publications, and MIIT have shown a greater increase for the past decade. (2) In terms of U-I-G interaction, for UG relations, the Tug value of MIIT universities has remained stable, while that of universities in China has become declined.

Net of accumulated advantages and disadvantages, social mobility may influence mortality through health selection or changes in well-being. Men and women working in 1996 up to age 65 are observed annually until 2012 in Swedish register data. Time-varying covariates and origin and destination status are controlled for in discrete time event-history analyses. Results show that when men were upwardly mobile, mortality was lower due to cancer, CVD, IHD, and suicide. Upward mobility was only associated with lower odds of suicide for women. When downwardly mobile, cancer mortality was higher for both men and women and smoking-related cancer mortality was higher for men. Social mobility was not linked to deaths related to accidents and poisoning or alcohol-related mortality. The results may support a relationship between social mobility and mortality characterized by health selection: Only in the case of a chronic illness (cancer) was downward mobility associated with higher mortality. The widespread relationship between upward mobility and lower mortality for men may also indicate positive health selection into attaining a higher class and that individuals with poor health may be less likely to search for better positions or receive promotions.",Serological and molecular detection of Bartonella henselae in specimens from patients with suspected cat scratch disease in Italy: A comparative study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735549,PloS one,2019 02 24,"Cat scratch disease (CSD) is an infectious disease caused by Bartonella henselae, usually characterized by self-limiting regional lymphadenopathy and fever. Given the low clinical diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of conventional anti-B. henselae indirect immunofluorescence assays (IFAs), real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based detection of B. henselae is now being proposed as a more sensitive tool to diagnose CSD. Thus, here we have assessed the efficacy of real-time PCR in detecting B. henselae in different specimens from patients with suspected CSD and compared it to that of IFA. From March 2011 to May 2016, at the Microbiology and Virology Unit, Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Città della Salute e della Scienza di Torino, Turin, Italy, 115 clinical specimens (56 aspirated pus, 39 fresh lymph node biopsies, and 20 whole blood samples) and 99 sera from 115 patients with suspected CSD (62 females and 53 males between the ages of 3 months and 68 years) were analyzed by both real-time PCR, used in a qualitative way, and IFA (IgM and IgG) for the presence of B. henselae. For 16 patients, serological results were not available due to a clinical decision not to request the test. B. henselae DNA positivity was detected by real-time PCR in 37.39% of patients, while 62.61% of them were negative. Thus, patients were divided into two groups: real-time PCR+ (n = 43) and real-time PCR- (n = 72). Real-time PCR screening of whole blood, biopsies, and aspirated pus revealed B. henselae positivity in 40%, 38.46%, and 35.71% of patients, respectively. When we analyzed samples by IFA, we found the presence of B. henselae in 28 out of 99 (28.28%) patients, of which 11 (11.11%) belonged to the real-time PCR+ group and 17 (17.17%) to the real-time PCR- group. Among the 71 seronegative subjects, 16 (16.16%) were found positive for B. henselae by real-time PCR. Thus, by combining the results of both assays, we were able to increase the percentage of B. henselae positive specimens from 27.27% (real-time PCR) or 28.28% (IFA) to 44.44% (real-time PCR+IFA). Altogether, these findings indicate that the early detection of B. henselae in patients with suspicious CSD through combined real-time PCR and serological analyses can lead to a more accurate diagnosis of CSD, thereby allowing prompt and appropriate disease management.",Measuring national capability over big science's multidisciplinarity: A case study of nuclear fusion research.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735548,PloS one,2019 02 24,"In the era of big science, countries allocate big research and development budgets to large scientific facilities that boost collaboration and research capability. A nuclear fusion device called the ""tokamak"" is a source of great interest for many countries because it ideally generates sustainable energy expected to solve the energy crisis in the future. Here, to explore the scientific effects of tokamaks, we map a country's research capability in nuclear fusion research with normalized revealed comparative advantage on five topical clusters-material, plasma, device, diagnostics, and simulation-detected through a dynamic topic model. Our approach captures not only the growth of China, India, and the Republic of Korea but also the decline of Canada, Japan, Sweden, and the Netherlands. Time points of their rise and fall are related to tokamak operation, highlighting the importance of large facilities in big science. The gravity model points out that two countries collaborate less in device, diagnostics, and plasma research if they have comparative advantages in different topics. This relation is a unique feature of nuclear fusion compared to other science fields. Our results can be used and extended when building national policies for big science."

This is a longitudinal and retrospective study carried out through the analysis of police reports (PRs) in the elder abuse police units of three Brazilian cities: Ribeirão Preto (SP), Teresina (PI), and João Pessoa (PB). Descriptive statistical analysis consisted of absolute and percentage frequencies. The chi-square test, Fisher's Exact test, and Relative Risk (RR) were used to analyze the data, with a 95% Confidence Interval (CI) and a significance of 5%. A total of 2,313 reports of older adult abuse were analyzed, of which 245 (10.6%) were related to reports of multiple abuse, 49.4% in Ribeirão Preto, São Paulo, 22.9% in João Pessoa, Paraíba, and 27.8% in Teresina, Piauí. Most of the victims of recurrent older adult abuse are female and younger elderly. Psychological abuse was the most recurrent, followed by financial abuse, occurring in the victim's own home. In João Pessoa, older women and elderly living with their abusers were at a higher risk of report of multiple abuse acts. In Ribeirão Preto, living with the aggressor was a risk factor for multiple violent acts. In the total population of the study, living without companion and not living with the aggressor were identified as protective factors against recurrent violence.

The Norwegian and Barents Seas (NoBa) Atlantis model was implemented for use in 'what if' scenarios, combining fisheries management strategies with the influences of climate change and climate variability. Before being used for this purpose, we wanted to evaluate and identify sensitive parameters and whether the species position in the foodweb influenced their sensitivity to parameter perturbation. Perturbing recruitment, mortality, prey consumption and growth by +/- 25% for nine biomass-dominating key species in the Barents Sea, while keeping the physical climate constant, proved the growth rate to be the most sensitive parameter in the model. Their trophic position in the ecosystem (lower trophic level, mid trophic level, top predators) influenced their responses to the perturbations. Top-predators, being generalists, responded mostly to perturbations on their individual life-history parameters. Mid-level species were the most vulnerable to perturbations, not only to their own individual life-history parameters, but also to perturbations on other trophic levels (higher or lower). Perturbations on the lower trophic levels had by far the strongest impact on the system, resulting in biomass changes for nearly all components in the system. Combined perturbations often resulted in non-additive model responses, including both dampened effects and increased impact of combined perturbations. Identifying sensitive parameters and species in end-to-end models will not only provide insights about the structure and functioning of the ecosystem in the model, but also highlight areas where more information and research would be useful-both for model parameterization, but also for constraining or quantifying model uncertainty.","Changes in the healthcare utilization after establishment of emergency centre in Yaoundé, Cameroon: A before and after cross-sectional survey analysis.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735533,PloS one,2019 02 24,"In effort to address the shortage of emergency medical care in Cameroon, the Yaoundé Emergency Center (CURY) was established in June, 2015 in Yaoundé, Cameroon.

In 2014 the first survey was conducted on randomly selected 619 households (3,201 individuals) living in six health districts of Yaoundé. In 2017 the second quantitative survey was conducted on 622 households (3,472 individuals) using the same survey methods as the first survey. In both surveys, data on demographic information, socioeconomic status, and utilization of healthcare, including emergency care in the past year were collected on every member of the households via face-to-face interview. Data on two surveys were compared. Participants in the both surveys had similar age and gender distribution with mean age of 21-22 and 46% being male. In 2014 survey, healthcare utilization rates for emergency unit, outpatient, and hospitalization were 4.8%, 36.7%, and 10.0%, respectively. In 2017 survey, corresponding rates were 5.8%, 32.5%, and 9.2%%, respectively.

SpexNPV has been evaluated as a potential insecticide for control of this pest and has served as the subject of research on baculovirus pathology and transmission. Occlusion bodies (OBs) of SpexNPV isolate 244.1 were examined, and the nucleotide sequence of the genome was determined and characterized. SpexNPV-244.1 OBs consisted of irregular polyhedra with a size and appearance typical for alphabaculoviruses. Virions within the polyhedra contained 1-8 nucleocapsids per unit envelope. The SpexNPV-244.1 genome was comprised of a 129,528 bp circular sequence, in which 139 ORFs were annotated. Five homologous regions (hrs) consisting of a variable number of 28-bp imperfect palindromes were identified in the genome. The genome sequence contained the 38 core genes of family Baculoviridae, as well as three ORFs unique to the SpexNPV sequence and one ORF that was apparently acquired by horizontal gene transfer with a betabaculovirus ancestor. Phylogenetic inference with core gene amino acid sequence alignments placed SpexNPV-244.1 in a lineage containing alphabaculoviruses of Spodoptera frugiperda and Spodopotera exigua which in turn is part of a larger group of alphabaculoviruses from the subfamily Noctuinae in the lepidopteran family Noctuidae. Kimura-2-parameter pairwise nucleotide distances indicated that SpexNPV-244.1 represented a different and previously unlisted species in the genus Alphabaculovirus. Gene parity plots indicated that the gene order of SpexNPV-244.l was extensively collinear with that of Spodoptera exigua NPV (SeMNPV). These plots also revealed a group of 17 core genes whose order was conserved in other alpha- and betabaculoviruses.","Subclinical atherosclerosis in psoriasis.

Thought essential to cellular refreshing, little is known about the origin of a constitutional rate of basal autophagy. Here, we found that loss of Drosophila vacuolar peduncle (vap), a presumed GAP enzyme, is associated with enhanced basal autophagy rate and physiological alterations resulting in a wasteful cell energy balance, a hallmark of overactive autophagy. By contrast, starvation-induced autophagy was disrupted in vap mutant conditions, leading to a block of maturation into autolysosomes. This phenotype stem for exacerbated biogenesis of PI(3)P-dependent endomembranes, including autophagosome membranes and ectopic fusions of vesicles. These findings shed new light on the neurodegenerative phenotype found associated to mutant vap adult brains in a former study. A partner of Vap, Sprint (Spri), acting as an endocytic GEF for Rab5, had the converse effect of leading to a reduction in PI(3)P-dependent endomembrane formation in mutants. Spri was conditional to normal basal autophagy and instrumental to the starvation-sensitivity phenotype specific of vap. Rab5 activity itself was essential for PI(3)P and for pre-autophagosome structures formation. We propose that Vap/Spri complexes promote a cell surface-derived flow of endocytic Rab5-containing vesicles, the traffic of which is crucial for the implementation of a basal autophagy rate.",Using the CustusX toolkit to create an image guided bronchoscopy application: Fraxinus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735513,PloS one,2019 02 24,"The aim of this paper is to show how a specialized planning and guidance application called Fraxinus, can be built on top of the CustusX platform (www.custusx.org), which is an open source image-guided intervention software platform.

The identification of translator stylometry contributes to many fields including education, intellectual property rights and forensic linguistics. In a two stage process, this paper first evaluates the use of existing lexical measures for the translator stylometry problem. Similar to previous research we found that using vocabulary richness in its traditional form as it has been used in the literature could not identify translator stylometry. This encouraged us to design an approach with the aim of identifying the distinctive patterns of a translator by employing network-motifs. Networks motifs are small sub-graphs which aim at capturing the local structure of a complex network. The proposed approach achieved an average accuracy of 83% in three-way classification. These results demonstrate that classic tools based on lexical features can be used for identifying translator stylometry if they get augmented with appropriate non-parametric scaling. Moreover, the use of complex network analysis and network motifs mining provided made it possible to design features that can solve translator stylometry analysis problems.",An outbreak of HIV infection among people who inject drugs linked to injection of propofol in Taiwan.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735511,PloS one,2019 02 24,The aim of this study was to report an HIV outbreak related to propofol-injection and the impact of regulating propofol on the HIV epidemic among people who inject drugs (PWID).,Anti-CD8 monoclonal antibody-mediated depletion alters the phenotype and behavior of surviving CD8+ T cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735510,PloS one,2019 06 10,"It is common practice for researchers to use antibodies to remove a specific cell type to infer its function. However, it is difficult to completely eliminate a cell type and there is often limited or no information as to how the cells which survive depletion are affected. This is particularly important for CD8+ T cells for two reasons. First, they are more resistant to mAb-mediated depletion than other lymphocytes. Second, targeting either the CD8α or CD8β chain could induce differential effects. We show here that two commonly used mAbs, against either the CD8α or CD8β subunit, can differentially affect cellular metabolism. Further, in vivo treatment leaves behind a population of CD8+ T cells with different phenotypic and functional attributes relative to each other or control CD8+ T cells. The impact of anti-CD8 antibodies on CD8+ T cell phenotype and function indicates the need to carefully consider the use of these, and possibly other ""depleting"" antibodies, as they could significantly complicate the interpretation of results or change the outcome of an experiment. These observations could impact how immunotherapy and modulation of CD8+ T cell activation is pursued.","Is there an association between consent rates in Swiss hospitals and critical care staffs' attitudes towards organ donation, their knowledge and confidence in the donation process?",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735508,PloS one,2019 02 24,"This study investigated the critical care staff's attitude, knowledge and involvement with donation, skills and confidence with donation-related tasks and their association with consent rates at the hospital level.

In univariable analysis, one score point increase in doctors' confidence resulted in a 66% (95% CI: 45%-80%) reduction in the odds to consent, and one score point increase in nurses' attitudes resulted in a 223% (95% CI: 84%-472%) increase in the odds to consent. After simultaneously adjusting for all major predictors found in the crude models, only levels of education of medical and nursing staff remained as significant predictors for hospital consent rates. In Switzerland, efforts are needed to increase consent rates for organ donation and should concentrate on continuous support as well as specific training of the hospital staff involved in the donation process.",Weighted lambda superstrings applied to vaccine design.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735507,PloS one,2019 02 24,"We generalize the notion of λ-superstrings, presented in a previous paper, to the notion of weighted λ-superstrings. This generalization entails an important improvement in the applications to vaccine designs, as it allows epitopes to be weighted by their immunogenicities. Motivated by these potential applications of constructing short weighted λ-superstrings to vaccine design, we approach this problem in two ways. First, we formalize the problem as a combinatorial optimization problem (in fact, as two polynomially equivalent problems) and develop an integer programming (IP) formulation for solving it optimally. Second, we describe a model that also takes into account good pairwise alignments of the obtained superstring with the input strings, and present a genetic algorithm that solves the problem approximately. We apply both algorithms to a set of 169 strings corresponding to the Nef protein taken from patiens infected with HIV-1. In the IP-based algorithm, we take the epitopes and the estimation of the immunogenicities from databases of experimental epitopes. In the genetic algorithm we take as candidate epitopes all 9-mers present in the 169 strings and estimate their immunogenicities using a public bioinformatics tool. Finally, we used several bioinformatic tools to evaluate the properties of the candidates generated by our method, which indicated that we can score high immunogenic λ-superstrings that at the same time present similar conformations to the Nef virus proteins.",Prevalence of TMD and level of chronic pain in a group of Brazilian adolescents.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735506,PloS one,2019 02 24,"To determine the prevalence of temporomandibular disorders and associated factors in an adolescent sample from Recife, Brazil.",Loose social organisation of AB strain zebrafish groups in a two-patch environment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735505,PloS one,2019 02 24,"We study the collective behaviour of zebrafish shoals of different numbers of individuals (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10 and 20 AB zebrafish Danio rerio) in a constraint environment composed of two identical square rooms connected by a corridor. This simple set-up is similar to a natural patchy environment. We track the positions and the identities of the fish and compute the metrics at the group and at the individual levels. First, we show that the number of fish affects the behaviour of each individual in a group, the cohesion of the groups, the preferential interactions and the transition dynamics between the two rooms. Second, during collective departures, we show that the rankings of exit correspond to the topological organisations of the fish prior to their collective departure. This spatial organisation appears in the group a few seconds before a collective departure. These results provide new evidences on the spatial organisation of the groups and the effect of the number of fish on individual and collective behaviours in a patchy environment.",Prevalence of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and associated factors among HIV positive educators: Findings from the 2015/6 survey of Health of Educators in Public Schools in South Africa.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735504,PloS one,2019 02 24,"In many sub-Saharan African countries, confronting the dual epidemic of HIV and NCDs is a public health priority especially in high HIV burden countries such as South Africa. Evidence shows that poor health as a consequence of NCDs and HIV among the workforce increases absenteeism and leads to decrease in productivity. However, the prevalence of these co-occurring chronic conditions and associated factors is unknown in the educator workforce. Improved understanding has implications for their management and wellbeing of educators.

A recently established urine antigen detection test using monoclonal antibody-based enzyme-linked-immunosorbent assay (mAb-ELISA) has shown promise due to its high diagnostic accuracy and the use of urine in place of fecal samples. To further test the utility of this urine assay, we performed a cross sectional study of 1,043 people in 3 opisthorchiasis endemic communities in northeast Thailand by applying urine antigen detection together with copro-antigen detection methods. The quantitative formalin-ethyl acetate concentration technique (FECT) was concurrently performed as a reference method. The prevalence of O. viverrini determined by urine antigen detection correlated well with that by copro-antigen detection and both methods showed 10-15% higher prevalence than FECT. Within the fecal negative cases by FECT, 29% and 43% were positive by urine and copro-antigen detection, respectively. The prevalence and intensity profiles determined by antigen detection and FECT showed similar patterns of increasing trends of infection with age. The concentration of antigen measured in urine showed a positive relationship with the concentration of copro-antigen, both of which were positively correlated with fecal egg counts. The data observed in this study indicate that urine antigen detection had high diagnostic accuracy and was in concordance with copro-antigen detection. Due to the ease and noninvasiveness of sample collection, the urine assay has high potential for clinical diagnosis as well as population screening in the program for the control and elimination of opisthorchiasis.",Rescue of collapsed replication forks is dependent on NSMCE2 to prevent mitotic DNA damage.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735491,PLoS genetics,2019 05 08,"NSMCE2 is an E3 SUMO ligase and a subunit of the SMC5/6 complex that associates with the replication fork and protects against genomic instability. Here, we study the fate of collapsed replication forks generated by prolonged hydroxyurea treatment in human NSMCE2-deficient cells. Double strand breaks accumulate during rescue by converging forks in normal cells but not in NSMCE2-deficient cells. Un-rescued forks persist into mitosis, leading to increased mitotic DNA damage. Excess RAD51 accumulates and persists at collapsed forks in NSMCE2-deficient cells, possibly due to lack of BLM recruitment to stalled forks. Despite failure of BLM to accumulate at stalled forks, NSMCE2-deficient cells exhibit lower levels of hydroxyurea-induced sister chromatid exchange. In cells deficient in both NSMCE2 and BLM, hydroxyurea-induced double strand breaks and sister chromatid exchange resembled levels found in NSCME2-deficient cells. We conclude that the rescue of collapsed forks by converging forks is dependent on NSMCE2.",Marine environmental DNA biomonitoring reveals seasonal patterns in biodiversity and identifies ecosystem responses to anomalous climatic events.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735490,PLoS genetics,2019 04 15,"Marine ecosystems are changing rapidly as the oceans warm and become more acidic. The physical factors and the changes to ocean chemistry that they drive can all be measured with great precision. Changes in the biological composition of communities in different ocean regions are far more challenging to measure because most biological monitoring methods focus on a limited taxonomic or size range. Environmental DNA (eDNA) analysis has the potential to solve this problem in biological oceanography, as it is capable of identifying a huge phylogenetic range of organisms to species level. Here we develop and apply a novel multi-gene molecular toolkit to eDNA isolated from bulk plankton samples collected over a five-year period from a single site. This temporal scale and level of detail is unprecedented in eDNA studies. We identified consistent seasonal assemblages of zooplankton species, which demonstrates the ability of our toolkit to audit community composition. We were also able to detect clear departures from the regular seasonal patterns that occurred during an extreme marine heatwave. The integration of eDNA analyses with existing biotic and abiotic surveys delivers a powerful new long-term approach to monitoring the health of our world's oceans in the context of a rapidly changing climate.",Accelerated bacterial detection in blood culture by enhanced acoustic flow cytometry (AFC) following peptide nucleic acid fluorescence in situ hybridization (PNA-FISH).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735489,PloS one,2019 02 24,"Bacteraemia is a risk factor for subsequent clinical deterioration and death. Current reliance on culture-based methods for detection of bacteraemia delays identification and assessment of this risk until after the optimal period for positively impacting treatment decisions has passed. Therefore, a method for rapid detection and identification of bacterial infection in the peripheral bloodstream in acutely ill patients is crucial for improved patient survival through earlier targeted antibiotic treatment. The turnaround time for current clinical laboratory methods ranges from 12 to 48 hours, emphasizing the need for a faster diagnostic test. Here we describe a novel assay for accelerated generic detection of bacteria in blood culture (BC) using peptide nucleic acid fluorescence in situ hybridization enhanced acoustic flow cytometry (PNA-FISH-AFC). For assay development, we used simulated blood cultures (BCs) spiked with one of three bacterial species at a low starting concentration of 10 CFU/mL: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Under current clinical settings, it takes a minimum of 12 hours incubation to reach positivity on the BacTEC system, corresponding to a bacterial concentration of 107-109 CFU/mL optimal for further analyses. In contrast, our PNA-FISH-AFC assay detected 103-104 CFU/mL bacteria in BC following a much shorter culture incubation of 5 to 10 hours. Using either PCR-based FilmArray assay or MALDI-TOF for bacterial detection, it took 7-10 and 12-24 hours of incubation, respectively, to reach the positive result. These findings indicate a potential time advantage of PNA-FISH-AFC assay for rapid bacterial detection in BC with significantly improved turnaround time over currently used laboratory techniques.","Hygroregulation, a key ability for eusocial insects: Native Western European honeybees as a case study.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735488,PloS one,2019 02 24,"Sociality has brought many advantages to various hymenoptera species, including their ability of regulating physical factors in their nest (e.g., temperature). Although less studied, humidity is known to be important for egg, larval and pupal development, and also for nectar concentration. Two subspecies of Apis mellifera of the M evolutionary lineage were used as models to test the ability of a superorganism (i.e. honeybee colony) to regulate the humidity in its nest (i.e. ""hygroregulation hypothesis"") in four conservation centers: two in France (A. m. mellifera) and two in Portugal (A. m. iberiensis). We investigated the ability of both subspecies to regulate the humidity in hives daily, but also during the seasons for one complete year. Our data and statistical analysis demonstrated the capacity of the bees to regulate humidity in their hive, regardless of the day, season or subspecies. Furthermore, the study showed that humidity in beehives is stable even during winter, when brood is absent, and when temperature is known to be less stable in the beehives. These results suggest that humidity is important for honeybees at every life stage, maybe because of the 'imprint' of the evolutionary history of this hymenopteran lineage.",Drosophila ZDHHC8 palmitoylates scribble and Ras64B and controls growth and viability.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735487,PloS one,2019 02 24,"Palmitoylation is an important posttranslational modification regulating diverse cellular functions. Consequently, aberrant palmitoylation can lead to diseases such as neuronal disorders or cancer. In humans there are roughly one hundred times more palmitoylated proteins than enzymes catalyzing palmitoylation (palmitoyltransferases). Therefore, it is an important challenge to establish the links between palmitoyltransferases and their targets. From publicly available data, we find that expression of human ZDHHC8 correlates significantly with cancer survival. To elucidate the organismal function of ZDHHC8, we study the Drosophila ortholog of hZDHHC8, CG34449/dZDHHC8. Knockdown of dZDHHC8 causes tissue overgrowth while dZDHHC8 mutants are larval lethal.

Grid-LMM can compute approximate (yet highly accurate) frequentist test statistics or Bayesian posterior summaries at a genome-wide scale in a fraction of the time compared to existing general-purpose methods. We apply Grid-LMM to two types of quantitative genetic analyses. The first is focused on accounting for spatial variability and non-additive genetic variance while scanning for QTL; and the second aims to identify gene expression traits affected by non-additive genetic variation. In both cases, modeling multiple sources of heterogeneity leads to new discoveries.",Correlation Between Adiponectin Gene rs1501299 Polymorphism and Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease Susceptibility: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735485,Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research,2019 04 29,"BACKGROUND Metabolic related nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is one of the most prevalent chronic liver diseases around the world. A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs1501299 (+276G>T) in the adiponectin gene has been recently revealed to be responsible for susceptibility to NAFLD. This meta-analysis intended to assess the association risk of NAFLD and rs1501299 polymorphism. MATERIAL AND METHODS We conducted a literature search on PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases. All involved studies were selected based on our search criteria. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to quantify the strength of the association. Subgroup analysis considered the effects of ethnicity, subject scope, and source of control. Publication bias was assessed by Begg's tests. RESULTS Eight qualified case-control studies with 1639 patients and 1426 controls demonstrated a significant correlation between rs1501299 polymorphism in adiponectin and NAFLD under the dominant model (OR=1.18, 95% CI=1.02-1.36), allelic contrast (OR=1.21, 95% CI=1.09-1.36), homozygote comparison (OR=1.63, 95% CI=1.26-2.01) and the recessive allele model (OR=1.58, 95% CI=1.23-2.02) with evident heterogeneity. No association was observed between the risk of NAFLD and the genotypic variants in heterozygote comparison (OR=1.11, 95% CI=0.95-1.29) without heterogeneity. Subgroup analysis suggested that the sample size could be the potential source of heterogeneity. Source of control was not the reason for between-study heterogeneity and further sensitivity analysis and publication bias revealed good consistency and symmetry in the pooling studies. CONCLUSIONS Results from our current meta-analysis gave insight into the correlation between rs1501299 polymorphism and the risk of NAFLD, indicating the variant of rs1501299 might be related to increased NAFLD susceptibility.",Meta-analytic framework for modeling genetic coexpression dynamics.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735484,Statistical applications in genetics and molecular biology,2019 02 15,"Methods for exploring genetic interactions have been developed in an attempt to move beyond single gene analyses. Because biological molecules frequently participate in different processes under various cellular conditions, investigating the changes in gene coexpression patterns under various biological conditions could reveal important regulatory mechanisms. One of the methods for capturing gene coexpression dynamics, named liquid association (LA), quantifies the relationship where the coexpression between two genes is modulated by a third ""coordinator"" gene. This LA measure offers a natural framework for studying gene coexpression changes and has been applied increasingly to study regulatory networks among genes. With a wealth of publicly available gene expression data, there is a need to develop a meta-analytic framework for LA analysis. In this paper, we incorporated mixed effects when modeling correlation to account for between-studies heterogeneity. For statistical inference about LA, we developed a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) estimation procedure through a Bayesian hierarchical framework. We evaluated the proposed methods in a set of simulations and illustrated their use in two collections of experimental data sets. The first data set combined 10 pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma gene expression studies to determine the role of possible coordinator gene USP9X in the Hippo pathway. The second experimental data set consisted of 907 gene expression microarray Escherichia coli experiments from multiple studies publicly available through the Many Microbe Microarray Database website (http://m3d.bu.edu/) and examined genes that coexpress with serA in the presence of coordinator gene Lrp.",Validation of the Greek version of the Quality of Life in Short Stature Youth (QoLISSY) questionnaire.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735483,Journal of pediatric endocrinology & metabolism : JPEM,2019 03 07,"Background The Quality of Life in Short Stature Youth (QoLISSY) questionnaire is a condition-specific instrument for measuring the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in short statured children/adolescents from patients' and parents' perspectives. The aim of this study was to investigate the psychometric properties of the Greek version of the QoLISSY questionnaire. Methods The original European QoLISSY scales were translated into Greek following the guidelines for linguistic validation and applied to 184 dyads of children 8-18 years old and their parents, as well as to 14 parents of children 4-7 years old in Greece. The field testing responses to the Greek version of QoLISSY were analyzed. Results The qualitative analysis of the Greek data provided results consistent with the European sample. The subsequent field test showed acceptable internal consistency (Cronbach α between 0.67-0.93) and high test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficients [ICC] ≥0.70). Correlations with the generic KIDSCREEN questionnaire indicated good convergent validity. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) also yielded acceptable results. Higher HRQoL for taller children suggests that QoLISSY was able to detect significant height-related differences. Conclusions The Greek version of the QoLISSY questionnaire is psychometrically sound and its use is recommended in further clinical research to ascertain the impact of short stature (SS) and treatments in Greek children/adolescents and families."

To overcome the limitations, we developed a new high-throughput platform for the identification and retrieval of clones in the library, TrueRepertoire™. This new platform provides highly accurate sequences of the clones with linkage information between heavy and light chains of the antibody fragment. Additionally, the physical DNA of clones can be retrieved in high throughput based on the sequence information.

We hypothesized that a persistent favorable perfusion profile exists in some patients beyond 24 hours from the onset and can be predicted by a lower baseline hypoperfusion intensity ratio, which indicates favorable collaterals. Methods- We identified control arm patients from the DEFUSE 3 trial (The Endovascular Therapy Following Imaging Evaluation for Ischemic Stroke) with a diffusion weighted imaging and perfusion magnetic resonance imaging performed 24 hours following randomization and compared imaging and clinical variables between patients with persistent mismatch versus patients who no longer had a mismatch 24 hours after randomization. Results- Eighteen percent of the control arm patients had a persistent favorable profile >38 hours after last known well time. These patients had similar baseline diffusion weighted imaging and Tmax >6 seconds volumes as patients whose initially favorable perfusion profile became unfavorable (diffusion weighted imaging lesion 7 versus 17 mL; P=0.17, Tmax >6 seconds 98 versus 100 mL; P=0.48) yet experienced less infarct growth (15 versus 59 mL; P<0.001) and had 3-fold smaller infarct volumes (15 versus 59 mL; P<0.001) 24 hours after randomization. Patients with a persistent favorable perfusion profile had a significantly lower hypoperfusion intensity ratio on baseline imaging (0.2 versus 0.4; P<0.01). Favorable clinical outcome at 90 days occurred in only 10% of the persistent mismatch patients. Conclusions- About 20% of patients with a middle cerebral artery or internal carotid artery occlusion who present in an extended time window and are not treated with thrombectomy have a persistent mismatch for at least an additional 24 hours. These patients have a favorable hypoperfusion intensity ratio at presentation, may experience delayed infarct expansion, and have poor clinical outcomes. Clinical trials are needed to determine if patients with a favorable perfusion profile benefit from reperfusion beyond 24 hours. Clinical Trial Registration- URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov .

Yearly vaccination of at-risk population groups is a well-recognized cost-effective/cost-saving preventive measure. It is, however, unclear which available alternative has the most favorable economic profile. Some available options are: trivalent (TIV) and quadrivalent (QIV) inactivated vaccines, adjuvanted TIV (aTIV). Because of immunosenescence, aTIV has been specifically developed for elderly. The present study aimed at assessing the available evidence of aTIV use in elderly from the economic perspective. A systematic literature review targeting aTIV economic evaluations in adults aged ≥65 years was performed using Medline via Ovid, Embase, DARE and NHS/EED. Of a total of 3,654 papers screened, 18 studies (13 full papers, 5 conference abstracts) were included. It emerged that compared with both non-vaccination or non-adjuvanted vaccines, aTIV was cost-effective or cost-saving.

Following FDA approval of CAR T cells directed against the CD19 protein for the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia and diffuse large B cell lymphoma, CAR T cells are poised to enter mainstream oncology. Despite this success, a number of patients are unable to receive this therapy due to inadequate T cell numbers or rapid disease progression. Furthermore, lack of response to CAR T cell treatment is due in some cases to intrinsic autologous T cell defects and/or the inability of these cells to function optimally in a strongly immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. We describe recent efforts to overcome these limitations using CRISPR/Cas9 technology, with the goal of enhancing potency and increasing the availability of CAR-based therapies. We further discuss issues related to the efficiency/scalability of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing in CAR T cells and safety considerations.

Currently, there are no vaccines or antiviral drugs available for CA16-associated disease. In this study, a CA16-specific monoclonal antibody (MAb) NA11F12 was derived with an epidemic CA16 strain (GenBank no. JX127258). NA11F12 was found to have high cross-neutralization activity against different CA16 subgenotypes but not EV71 using RD cells. The neutralizing titers of NA11F12 ranged from 1:1024 to 1:12288 against A, B1, B2 and C subgenotypes of CA16 and was less than 8 against EV71 strain. In the neonatal mouse model, a single treatment of NA11F12 showed effective protection with a dose- and time-dependent relationship against lethal challenge by CA16 strain (GenBank no. JX481738). At day 1 post-infection, administering more than 0.1 μg/g of NA11F12 could protect 100% newborn mice from mobility and mortality challenged by CA16. With dose of 10 μg/g of NA11F12, a single administration fully protected mice against CA16-associated disease within 4 days post-infection. And there were 80% and 60% mice protected by administering NA11F12 at day 5 post-infection and day 6 post-infection when the control mice had shown clinical symptoms for 1- and 2-day, respectively. Immunohistochemical and histological analysis confirmed that NA11F12 significantly prohibited CA16 VP1 expression in various tissues and prevented CA16-induced necrosis. In conclusion, a CA16-specific MAb NA11F12 with high cross-neutralization activity was identified, which could effectively protect lethal CA16 challenge in mice. It could be a potential therapeutic MAb against CA16 in the future.","Unified Classification of Molecular, Network, and Endocrine Features of Hypothalamic Neurons.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735460,Annual review of neuroscience,2019 02 08,"Peripheral endocrine output relies on either direct or feed-forward multi-order command from the hypothalamus.

The identification of the underlying disease often represents a challenging situation in clinical practice. Areas covered: The prevalence of SO in the real world may vary, ranging from 17% to 80%; therefore, search for a form of SO represents a pillar when evaluating patients with osteoporosis. Guidelines for treatment of specific secondary forms of osteoporosis, such as glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis, have been published even though often neglected in clinical practice. For the majority of SO, there are currently no specific guidelines concerning treatment with only few trials showing the effect of bone-active drugs on fracture risk reduction. Expert opinion: Healthcare professionals should be aware of the secondary forms of osteoporosis, in particular when the reason for reduced skeletal resistance is uncertain or when bone mineral density results are unsatisfactory in a patient compliant to therapy. In a few cases (such as, for example: no response to therapy, better classification of bone involvement in patients with kidney failure, suspicion of rare metabolic bone disease) bone biopsy is needed to investigate the patient.

The goals of this article are, estimating influenza vaccination coverage of Health Care Workers (HCWs) in tertiary children hospital, evaluating attitudes and practices of HCWs and evaluating whether HCWs vaccination uptake improved with onsite vaccination campaign. This was a before-after trial, which was carried out in a tertiary children hospital at 2017-2018 influenza season. The vaccination team visited all participants and collected information about previous vaccination uptake, attitudes and beliefs of HCWs by means of an anonymous questionnaire. Moreover, the influenza vaccine was offered onsite to all participants. A total of 572 HCWs participated in this study (response rate: 94.2%). Coverage was 10.8% in 2016-17 season and 39.9% in 2017-18 season (p < 0.0001). Multivariate regression analysis showed that being younger than 35 years (OR: 2.09), being vaccinated in previous season (OR: 47.02) and professional category of the participant (clinicians being reference group; OR: 1.73 for support staff and OR: 0.23 for nurses,) were significantly associated with vaccination uptake in 2017-18 season [95% CI]. None of the participants with former bad experience about vaccination was vaccinated in 2017-2018 season. And 90% of the participants having lack of knowledge about the vaccine were vaccinated in 2017-2018 season. After onsite vaccination campaign, influenza vaccination coverage improved significantly among HCWs. In order to achieve target vaccination coverage we should break down the prejudices with a comprehensive education program.

These and related enzymes act in conjunction with marked crosstalk within a complex lipid mediator (LM) network where also specialized proresolving LMs (SPMs) are formed. Here, we present how prominent LM pathways can be differentially modulated in human proinflammatory M1 and proresolving M2 macrophage phenotypes that, upon exposure to Escherichia coli, produce either abundant prostaglandins and leukotrienes (M1) or SPMs (M2). Targeted liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry-based metabololipidomics was applied to analyze and quantify the specific LM profiles. Besides expected on-target actions, we found that: 1) COX or 15-LOX-1 inhibitors elevate inflammatory leukotriene levels, 2) FLAP and 5-LOX inhibitors reduce leukotrienes in M1 but less so in M2 macrophages, 3) zileuton blocks resolution-initiating SPM biosynthesis, whereas FLAP inhibition increases SPM levels, and 4) that the 15-LOX-1 inhibitor 3887 suppresses SPM formation in M2 macrophages. Conclusively, interference with discrete LM biosynthetic enzymes in different macrophage phenotypes considerably affects the LM metabolomes with potential consequences for inflammation-resolution pharmacotherapy. Our data may allow better appraisal of the therapeutic potential of these drugs to intervene with inflammatory disorders.-Werner, M., Jordan, P.

Regulatory, integrative and comparative physiology",2019 03 21,"Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and subsequent neonatal catch-up growth are implicated in programming of insulin resistance later in life. Spontaneous IUGR in the guinea pig, due to natural variation in litter size, produces offspring with asymmetric IUGR and neonatal catch-up growth. We hypothesized that spontaneous IUGR and/or accelerated neonatal growth would impair insulin sensitivity in adult guinea pigs. Insulin sensitivity of glucose metabolism was determined by hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp (HEC) in 38 (21 male, 17 female) young adult guinea pigs from litters of two-to-four pups. A subset (10 male, 8 female) were infused with d-[3-3H]glucose before and during the HEC to determine rates of basal and insulin-stimulated glucose utilization, storage, glycolysis, and endogenous glucose production. n males, the insulin sensitivity of whole body glucose uptake ( r = 0.657, P = 0.002) and glucose utilization ( r = 0.884, P = 0.004) correlated positively and independently with birth weight, but not with neonatal fractional growth rate (FGR10-28). In females, the insulin sensitivity of whole body and partitioned glucose metabolism was not related to birth weight, but that of endogenous glucose production correlated negatively and independently with FGR10-28 ( r = -0.815, P = 0.025). Thus, perinatal growth programs insulin sensitivity of glucose metabolism in the young adult guinea pig and in a sex-specific manner; impaired insulin sensitivity, including glucose utilization, occurs after IUGR in males and impaired hepatic insulin sensitivity after rapid neonatal growth in females.","Low-protein and methionine, high-starch diets increase energy intake and expenditure, increase FGF21, decrease IGF-1, and have little effect on adiposity in mice.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735436,"American journal of physiology. Regulatory, integrative and comparative physiology",2019 04 22,"Low-protein diets most often induce increased energy intake in an attempt to increase protein intake to meet protein needs with a risk of accumulation as fat of the excess energy intake. In female adult BALB/c mice, a decrease in dietary casein from 20% to 6% and 3% increased energy intake and slightly increased adiposity, and this response was exacerbated with soy proteins with low methionine content. The effect on fat mass was however limited because total energy expenditure increased to the same extent as energy intake. Lean body mass was preserved in all 6% fed mice and reduced only in 3% casein-fed animals. Insulin response to an oral glucose tolerance test was reduced in soy-fed mice and in low-protein-fed mice. Low-protein diets did not affect uncoupling protein 1 and increased fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) in brown adipose tissue and increased FGF21, fatty acid synthase, and cluster of differentiation 36 in the liver. In the hypothalamus, neuropeptide Y was increased and proopiomelanocortin was decreased only in 3% casein-fed mice. In plasma, when protein was decreased, insulin-like growth factor-1 decreased and FGF21 increased and plasma FGF21 was best described by using a combination of dietary protein level, protein-to-carbohydrate ratio, and protein-to-methionine ratio in the diet. In conclusion, reducing dietary protein and protein quality increases energy intake but also energy expenditure resulting in an only slight increase in adiposity. In this process, FGF21 is probably an important signal that responds to a complex combination of protein restriction, protein quality, and carbohydrate content of the diet.",KEYNOTE-590: Phase III study of first-line chemotherapy with or without pembrolizumab for advanced esophageal cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735435,"Future oncology (London, England)",2019 04 10,Treatment options for patients with advanced esophageal or esophagogastric junction (EGJ) cancer are limited.

The metallic state obtained by doping, substitution, or pulsed charge injection is characterized by an emergent CDW domain-wall network, while single domain walls can be found in the pristine Mott state. Here we study whether and how the single walls become metallic. Tunneling spectroscopy reveals partial suppression of the Mott gap and the presence of in-gap states strongly localized at the domain-wall sites. Using the real-space dynamical mean field theory description of the strongly correlated quantum-paramagnet ground state, we show that the local gap suppression follows from the increased hopping along the connected zigzag chain of lattice sites forming the domain wall. Furthermore, we show that full metallization is preempted by the splitting of the quasiparticle band into bonding and antibonding subbands due to the structural dimerization of the wall, explaining the presence of the in-gap states and the low density of states at the Fermi level.",Spin-Wave Amplification and Lasing Driven by Inhomogeneous Spin-Transfer Torques.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735417,Physical review letters,2019 02 15,"We show that an inhomogeneity in the spin-transfer torques in a metallic ferromagnet under suitable conditions strongly amplifies incoming spin waves. Moreover, at nonzero temperatures the incoming thermally occupied spin waves will be amplified such that the region with inhomogeneous spin-transfer torques emits spin waves spontaneously, thus constituting a spin-wave laser. We determine the spin-wave scattering amplitudes for a simplified model and setup, and show under which conditions the amplification and lasing occurs.

Particles with negative energy at infinity are a general feature, and can contribute significantly to black-hole rotational-energy extraction in a variant of the Penrose process. The generated plasma distribution depends on the pair-creation environment, and we describe two distinct realizations of the force-free electrodynamic solution.

A quantum critical point is revealed at x∼0.42, where non-Fermi-liquid behaviors similar to those in BaFe_{2}(As_{1-x}P_{x})_{2} are observed. Neutron diffraction and inelastic neutron scattering measurements suggest that the quantum critical point is associated with the antiferromagnetic order, which is not of conventional spin-density-wave type as evidenced by the ω/T scaling of spin excitations. On the other hand, no divergence of low-temperature nematic susceptibility is observed when x is decreased to 0.42 from higher doping level, demonstrating that there are no nematic quantum critical fluctuations. Our results suggest that non-Fermi-liquid behaviors in iron-based superconductors can be solely resulted from the antiferromagnetic quantum critical fluctuations, which cast doubts on the role of nematic fluctuations played in the normal-state properties in iron-based superconductors.",Protocol Dependence and State Variables in the Force-Moment Ensemble.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735414,Physical review letters,2019 02 15,"Stress-based ensembles incorporating temperaturelike variables have been proposed as a route to an equation of state for granular materials. To test the efficacy of this approach, we perform experiments on a two-dimensional photoelastic granular system under three loading conditions: uniaxial compression, biaxial compression, and simple shear. From the interparticle forces, we find that the distributions of the normal component of the coarse-grained force-moment tensor are exponential tailed, while the deviatoric component is Gaussian distributed. This implies that the correct stress-based statistical mechanics conserves both the force-moment tensor and the Maxwell-Cremona force-tiling area. As such, two variables of state arise: the tensorial angoricity (α[over ^]) and a new temperaturelike quantity associated with the force-tile area which we name keramicity (κ). Each quantity is observed to be inversely proportional to the global confining pressure; however, only κ exhibits the protocol independence expected of a state variable, while α[over ^] behaves as a variable of process.",Tunable Plasma-Based Energy Dechirper.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735413,Physical review letters,2019 02 15,"A tunable plasma-based energy dechirper has been developed at FLASHForward to remove the correlated energy spread of a 681 MeV electron bunch.

Our technique is based on the Bose polaron model; namely, an impurity embedded in the BEC acts as the thermometer. We propose to detect temperature fluctuations from measurements of the position and momentum of the impurity. Crucially, these cause minimal backaction on the BEC and hence, realize a nondemolition temperature measurement. Following the paradigm of the emerging field of quantum thermometry, we combine tools from quantum parameter estimation and the theory of open quantum systems to solve the problem in full generality. We thus avoid any simplification, such as demanding thermalization of the impurity atoms, or imposing weak dissipative interactions with the BEC. Our method is illustrated with realistic experimental parameters common in many labs, thus showing that it can compete with state-of-the-art destructive techniques, even when the estimates are built from the outcomes of accessible (suboptimal) quadrature measurements.",Extensional Strain Hardening in Highly Entangled Molecular Bottlebrushes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735410,Physical review letters,2019 02 15,"The highly strained conformation in dense molecular bottlebrushes (DB) has profound effects on the dynamics of these type of macromolecules.

The nonlinear response of poly(1-octadecene), a highly entangled α-olefin DB with linear side chains sixteen carbons long, is studied here and compared to the nonlinear response of a linear polyolefin (polypropylene) with equivalent linear viscoelastic response. We found that the DB shows remarkably larger extensional strain hardening (SH) and extensibility than the linear polyolefin. The strong SH is attributed to a strain-induced increase in friction drag between adjacent chains resulting from side-chain interdigitation and alignment perpendicular to the flow. The higher extensibility of DBs compared to linear counterparts has been predicted previously [Daniel et al., Nat.

The quantum oscillations, superposed on the positive LMC, are a remarkable fingerprint of a WSM phase with a chiral anomaly, whose observation is a valid criteria for identifying a WSM material.

Yet, it can be afflicted by a variety of neurodegenerative diseases specifically linked to aging, about which we lack a full biomolecular understanding of onset and progression, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD).

In this study, we investigated the three-dimensional near-field characteristics of high-order plasmon modes excited in a gold hexagonal nanoplate. From the near-field spectroscopic images, we found that both in-plane and out-of-plane plasmon modes observed near 900 nm were spectrally and spatially overlapped. We performed three-dimensional near-field measurement to reveal the optical characteristics of the overlapped modes in detail. We found that the steric near-field distribution near the nanoplate strongly depended on the plasmon mode, and the out-of-plane mode confines electromagnetic fields more tightly than the in-plane mode. We also found that the in-plane mode was dominantly visualized as the probe tip-sample distance increased.

B,2019 03 14,"Fully atomistic simulations of models of asphaltenes in simple solvents have allowed the study of trends in aggregation phenomena to understand the underlying role played by molecular structure. The detail included at this scale of molecular modeling is, however, at odds with the required spatial and temporal resolution needed to fully understand asphaltene aggregation. The computational cost required to explore the relevant scales can be reduced by employing coarse-grained (CG) models, which consist of lumping a few atoms into a single segment that is characterized by effective interactions. In this work, CG force fields developed via the statistical associating fluid theory (SAFT-γ) [ Müller , E. A. ; Jackson , G. Annu. Rev. Chem. Biomol. Eng. 5 , 2014 , 405 - 427 ] equation of state (EoS) provide a reliable pathway to link the molecular description with macroscopic thermophysical data. A recent modification of the SAFT-VR EoS [ Müller , E. A. ; Mejía , A. Langmuir 33 , 2017 , 11518 - 11529 ], which allows for the parameterization of homonuclear rings, is selected as the starting point to develop CG models for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. The new aromatic-core models, along with others published for simpler organic molecules, are adopted for the construction of asphaltene models by combining different chemical moieties in a group-contribution fashion. We apply the procedure to two previously reported asphaltene models and perform molecular dynamics simulations to validate the coarse-grained representation against benchmark systems of 27 asphaltenes in a pure solvent (toluene or heptane) described in a fully atomistic fashion. An excellent match between both levels of description is observed for the cluster size, radii of gyration, and relative-shape-anisotropy-factor distributions. We exploit the advantages of the CG representation by simulating systems containing up to 2000 asphaltene molecules in an explicit solvent investigating the effect of asphaltene concentration, solvent composition, and temperature on aggregation. By studying large systems facilitated by the use of CG models, we observe stable continuous distributions of molecular aggregates at conditions away from the two-phase precipitation point. As a further example application, a widely accepted interpretation of cluster-size distributions in asphaltenic systems is challenged by performing system-size tests, reversibility checks, and a time-dependence analysis. The proposed coarse-graining procedure is seen to be general and predictive and, hence, can be applied to other asphaltenic molecular structures.","Medical Uses of Silver: History, Myths, and Scientific Evidence.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735392,Journal of medicinal chemistry,2019 02 21,"Silver has no biological role, and it is particularly toxic to lower organisms. Although several silver formulations employed in medicine in the past century are prescribed and sold to treat certain medical conditions, most of the compounds, including those showing outstanding properties as antimicrobial or anticancer agents, are still in early stages of assessment, that is, in vitro studies, and may not make it to clinical trials. Unlike other heavy metals, there is no evidence that silver is a cumulative poison, but its levels can build up in the body tissues after prolonged exposure leading to undesired effects. In this review, we deal with the journey of silver in medicine going from the alternative or do-it-yourself drug to scientific evidence related to its uses. The many controversies push scientists to move toward a more comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms involved.",LC-HRMS-Database Screening Metrics for Rapid Prioritization of Samples to Accelerate the Discovery of Structurally New Natural Products.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735391,Journal of natural products,2019 02 22,"In order to accelerate the isolation and characterization of structurally new or novel secondary metabolites, it is crucial to develop efficient strategies that prioritize samples with greatest promise early in the workflow so that resources can be utilized in a more efficient and cost-effective manner. We have developed a metrics-based prioritization approach using exact LC-HRMS, which uses data for 24 618 marine natural products held in the PharmaSea database. Each sample was evaluated and allocated a metric score by a software algorithm based on the ratio of new masses over the total (sample novelty), ratio of known masses over the total (chemical novelty), number of peaks above a defined peak area threshold (sample complexity), and peak area (sample diversity). Samples were then ranked and prioritized based on these metric scores. To validate the approach, eight marine sponges and six tunicate samples collected from the Fiji Islands were analyzed, metric scores calculated, and samples targeted for isolation and characterization of new compounds. Structures of new compounds were elucidated by spectroscopic techniques, including 1D and 2D NMR, MS, and MS/MS. Structures were confirmed by computer-assisted structure elucidation methods (CASE) using the ACD/Structure Elucidator Suite.","Synthesis and Structure Reassignment of Malylglutamate, a Recently Discovered Earthworm Metabolite.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735390,Journal of natural products,2019 02 22,"Malylglutamate, a newly identified metabolite in earthworms, was synthesized using a traditional peptide coupling approach for assembling the amide from protected malate and glutamate precursors. The proposed structure (1) and a diastereomer were synthesized, but their NMR spectra did not match the natural sample. Further analysis of the natural sample using HMBC spectroscopy suggested an alternative attachment of the malyl moiety, and β-malylglutamate (2) diastereomers were synthesized, L,L-2 and D,D-2. NMR spectra were an excellent match with the natural sample, and chiral-phase chromatography was employed to identify (-)-β-l-malyl-l-glutamate (2) as the isomer native to Eisenia fetida.","Acidiphilamides A-E, Modified Peptides as Autophagy Inhibitors from an Acidophilic Actinobacterium, Streptacidiphilus rugosus.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735389,Journal of natural products,2019 02 22,"Five new tripeptides, acidiphilamides A-E (1-5), were discovered along with two previously reported compounds, l-isoleucinamide (6) and l-valinamide (7), from Streptacidiphilus rugosus AM-16, an acidophilic actinobacterial strain isolated from acidic forest soil. The structures of 1-5 were elucidated as modified tripeptides bearing phenylalaninol or methioninol fragments with C3-C5 acyl chains based mainly on NMR and mass spectroscopic data. The absolute configurations of the amine units were established by advanced Marfey's method and GITC (2,3,4,6-tetra- O-acetyl-β-d-glucopyranosyl isothiocyanate) derivatization followed by LC/MS analysis. Acidiphilamides A and B (1 and 2), the first secondary metabolites isolated from the rare actinobacterial genus Streptacidiphilus, significantly inhibited autophagic flux but not proteasome activity in HeLa cells. These compounds appeared to block mainly the autophagosome-lysosome fusion step in the late stage of cellular autophagy."

In this work, we have established a metabolite-based mass spectrometry (MS) method for rapid detection of HLB in navel orange trees. Without sample pretreatment, characteristic mass spectra can be directly obtained from the raw plant samples using the direct MS method. The whole detection process can be accomplished within 1 min. By monitoring and comparisons of the healthy and infected plants throughout a whole year, characteristic MS peaks of metabolites are found to be specific responses from infected plants and, thus, could be used as biomarkers for detection of HLB. Therefore, HLB could be directly detected in the asymptomatic samples, such as stems, using this metabolite-based direct MS method. In addition, principal component analysis and partial least squares discriminant analysis modes of metabolites from healthy and infected trees were established for investigating differentiation and seasonal variations of HLB in leaves, veins, and stems, providing valuable information for understanding the HLB in different seasons.",Insights into the Trends in the Acidity Strength of Organic and Inorganic Compounds: A Valence-Bond Perspective.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735375,The journal of physical chemistry. A,2019 03 13,"Few concepts are more familiar to chemists than the concept of acidity strength. In almost any undergraduate chemistry textbook, one can find lists of factors affecting the acidities of organic and inorganic molecules. The factors, invoked to explain trends in the acidity strength through series of compounds, rely on concepts such as hybridization, delocalization, inductive effects, and electronegativity. Some of these concepts could be considered somewhat fuzzy, whereas others have a rigorous physical definition, yet together they shape the traditional framework used by chemists for the qualitative assessment of acidity strengths. At the same time, a thermodynamic cycle reveals that the acidity of a H-A bond is dependent on only three unequivocally definable quantities: the bond dissociation energy, the electron affinity of A, and the solvent effects. Here we attempt to answer the following questions: ""How are the qualitative factors, found in textbooks, related to these quantities?"" and ""How can we connect this plethora of factors to the nature of the acidic H-A bond being cleaved heterolytically in an acidic dissociation process?"" To do so, we turn to valence bond theory and model a generic acidic dissociation process. Within this model, the quantities, determining the acidity strength of an H-A compound (as revealed through the thermodynamic cycling process), arise naturally and lucidly, thus enabling the evaluation of the effects of the different qualitative factors found in the literature on the bonding situation. Our analysis projects surprising and thought-provoking anomalies, which challenge common chemical knowledge.",Insights into Urease Inhibition by N-( n-Butyl) Phosphoric Triamide through an Integrated Structural and Kinetic Approach.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735374,Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,2019 03 08,"The nickel-dependent enzyme urease represents a negative element for the efficiency of soil nitrogen fertilization as well as a virulence factor for a large number of pathogenic and antibiotic-resistant bacteria. The development of ever more efficient urease inhibitors demands knowledge of their modes of action at the molecular level. N-( n-Butyl)-phosphoric triamide (NBPTO) is the oxo-derivative of N-( n-butyl)-thiophosphoric triamide (NBPT), which is extensively employed in agriculture to increase the efficiency of urea-based fertilizers. The 1.45 Å resolution structure of the enzyme-inhibitor complex obtained upon incubation of Sporosarcina pasteurii urease (SPU) with NBPTO shows the presence of diamido phosphoric acid (DAP), generated upon enzymatic hydrolysis of NBPTO with the release of n-butyl amine. DAP is bound in a tridentate binding mode to the two Ni(II) ions in the active site of urease via two O atoms and an amide NH2 group, whereas the second amide group of DAP points away from the metal center into the active-site channel. The mobile flap modulating the size of the active-site cavity is found in a disordered closed-open conformation. A kinetic characterization of the NBPTO-based inhibition of both bacterial (SPU) and plant ( Canavalia ensiformis or jack bean, JBU) ureases, carried out by calorimetric measurements, indicates the occurrence of a reversible slow-inhibition mode of action. The latter is characterized by a very small value of the equilibrium dissociation constant of the urease-DAP complex caused, in turn, by the large rate constant for the formation of the enzyme-inhibitor complex. The much greater capability of NBPTO to inhibit urease, as compared with that of NBPT, is thus not caused by the presence of a P═O moiety versus a P═S moiety, as previously suggested, but rather by the readiness of NBPTO to react with urease without the need to convert one of the P-NH2 amide moieties to its P-OH acid derivative, as in the case of NBPT. The latter process is indeed characterized by a very small equilibrium constant that reduces drastically the concentration of the active form of the inhibitor in the case of NBPT. This indicates that high-efficiency phosphoramide-based urease inhibitors must have at least one O atom bound to the central P atom in order for the molecule to efficiently and rapidly bind to the dinickel center of the enzyme.",Transferable Kinetic Monte Carlo Models with Thousands of Reactions Learned from Molecular Dynamics Simulations.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735373,The journal of physical chemistry. A,2019 03 13,"Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation of complex chemistry typically involves thousands of atoms propagating over millions of time steps, generating a wealth of data. Traditionally these data are used to calculate some aggregate properties of the system and then discarded, but we propose that these data can be reused to study related chemical systems. Using approximate chemical kinetic models and methods from statistical learning, we study hydrocarbon chemistries under extreme thermodynamic conditions. We discover that a single MD simulation can contain sufficient information about reactions and rates to predict the dynamics of related yet different chemical systems using kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulation. Our learned KMC models identify thousands of reactions and run 4 orders of magnitude faster than MD. The transferability of these models suggests that we can viably reuse data from existing MD simulations to accelerate future simulation studies and reduce the number of new MD simulations required.",Mechanism of Spin-Exchange Internal Conversion: Practical Proxies for Diabatic and Nonadiabatic Couplings.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735372,Journal of chemical theory and computation,2019 03 12,"Spin-exchange internal conversion (SEIC) is a general class of reactions having singlet fission and triplet fusion as particular cases. Based on a charge transfer (CT) mediated mechanism and analytical derivation with a model Hamiltonian, we propose proxies for estimating the coupling strength in both diabatic and adiabatic pictures for general SEIC reactions. In the diabatic picture, we demonstrated the existence of a bilinear relationship between the coupling strength and molecular orbital overlap, which provides a practical way to predict diabatic couplings. In the adiabatic picture, we showed that nonadiabatic couplings can be approximated by simple functions of the wave function CT coefficients. These approaches were verified through the investigation of singlet oxygen photosensitization, where both 1Δg and 1Σg oxygen states can be competitively generated by a triplet fusion reaction. The interplay between the CT-mediated mechanism, the spatial factors of the bimolecular complex, and the electronic structure of the oxygen molecule during the reaction explains the curiously small coupling to the 1Σg state along specific incidence directions. The results from both the diabatic and adiabatic pictures provide a comprehensive understanding of the reaction mechanism, which applies to general SEIC problems.","Developmental Toxicity of a Neonicotinoid Insecticide, Acetamiprid to Zebrafish Embryos.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735371,Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,2019 03 18,"Agricultural use of neonicotinoid insecticides is increasing worldwide, posing a risk to nontarget organisms. The present study investigated developmental toxicity of a widely used neonicotinoid, acetamiprid, to zebrafish embryos. Sublethal (malformations, hatchability, heart rate, body length, alteration of spontaneous movement and touch responses) and lethal effects were monitored during exposure period from 6 h post fertilization (hpf) to 120 hpf. Zebrafish embryos exhibited significant mortality and teratogenic effects at acetamiprid concentration greater than 263 mg/L, with bent spine being the main malformation. Toxicity spectra were constructed to rank the sensitivity of individual end points to acetamiprid exposure and impaired spontaneous movement was the most sensitive end point of those tested. The present study provides the basis for understanding developmental toxicity of acetamiprid exposure to zebrafish embryos. This information is critical for future studies evaluating aquatic risk from neonicotinoids as little is known regarding adverse effects of neonicotinoids to aquatic vertebrate species.",Structure-Based Design of N-(5-Phenylthiazol-2-yl)acrylamides as Novel and Potent Glutathione S-Transferase Omega 1 Inhibitors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735370,Journal of medicinal chemistry,2019 03 28,"Using reported glutathione S-transferase omega 1 (GSTO1-1) cocrystal structures, we designed and synthesized acrylamide-containing compounds that covalently bind to Cys32 on the catalytic site. Starting from a thiazole derivative 10 (GSTO1-1 IC50 = 0.6 μM), compound 18 was synthesized and cocrystallized with GSTO1. Modification on the amide moiety of hit compound 10 significantly increased the GSTO1-1 inhibitory potency. We solved the cocrystal structures of new derivatives, 37 and 44, bearing an amide side chain bound to GSTO1. These new structures showed a reorientation of the phenyl thiazole core of inhibitors, 37 and 44, when compared to 18. Guided by the cocrystal structure of GSTO1:44, analogue 49 was designed, resulting in the most potent GSTO1-1 inhibitor (IC50 = 0.22 ± 0.02 nM) known to date. We believe that our data will form the basis for future studies of developing GSTO1-1 as a new drug target for cancer therapy.",A Metabolic Engineering Approach to Incorporate Modified Pyrimidine Nucleosides into Cellular RNA.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735369,Journal of the American Chemical Society,2019 02 27,"The incorporation of modified nucleotides into RNA is a powerful strategy to probe RNA structure and function. While a wide variety of modified nucleotides can be incorporated into RNA in vitro using chemical or enzymatic synthesis, strategies for the metabolic incorporation of artificial nucleotides into cellular RNA are limited, largely due to the incompatibility of modified nucleobases and nucleosides with nucleotide salvage pathways. In this work, we develop a metabolic engineering strategy to facilitate the labeling of cellular RNA with noncanonical pyrimidine nucleosides. First, we use structure-based protein engineering to alter the substrate specificity of uridine-cytidine kinase 2 (UCK2), a key enzyme in the pyrimidine nucleotide salvage pathway. Next, we show that expression of mutant UCK2 in HeLa and U2OS cells is sufficient to enable the incorporation of 5-azidomethyl uridine (5-AmU) into cellular RNA and promotes RNA labeling by other C5-modified pyrimidines. Finally, we apply UCK2-mediated RNA labeling with 5-AmU to study RNA trafficking and turnover during normal and stress conditions and find diminished RNA localization in the cytosol during arsenite stress. Taken together, our study provides a general strategy for the incorporation of modified pyrimidine nucleosides into cellular RNA and expands the chemical toolkit of modified bases for studying dynamic RNA behavior in living cells.",Enhancing the Potency of Antimicrobial Peptides through Molecular Engineering and Self-Assembly.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735368,Biomacromolecules,2019 03 11,"Healthcare-associated infections resulting from bacterial attachment and biofilm formation on medical implants are posing significant challenges in particular with the emergence of bacterial resistance to antibiotics. Here, we report the design, synthesis and characterization of self-assembled nanostructures, which integrate on their surface antibacterial peptides. The antibacterial WMR peptide, which is a modification of the native sequence of the myxinidin, a marine peptide isolated from the epidermal mucus of hagfish, was used considering its enhanced activity against Gram-negative bacteria. WMR was linked to a peptide segment of aliphatic residues (AAAAAAA) containing a lipidic tail (C19H38O2) attached to the ε-amino of a terminal lysine to generate a peptide amphiphile (WMR PA). The self-assembly of the WMR PA alone, or combined with coassembling shorter PAs, was studied using spectroscopy and microscopy techniques. The designed PAs were shown to self-assemble into stable nanofiber structures and these nanoassemblies significantly inhibit biofilm formation and eradicate the already formed biofilms of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Gram-negative bacteria) and Candida albicans (pathogenic fungus) when compared to the native WMR peptide.

Herein we introduce a simple method for direct isolation and subsequent detection of a specific population of exosomes using an engineered superparamagnetic material with multifunctional properties, namely, gold-loaded ferric oxide nanocubes (Au-NPFe2O3NC). In this method, the Au-NPFe2O3NC were initially functionalized with a generic tetraspanin (exosomes-associated) antibody (i.e., CD63) and dispersed in sample fluids where they work as ""dispersible nanocarriers"" to capture the bulk population of exosomes. After magnetic collection and purification, Au-NPFe2O3NC-bound exosomes were transferred to the tissue-specific, antibody-modified, screen-printed electrode. As a proof of principle, we used a specific placental marker, placenta alkaline phosphatase (PLAP), to detect exosomes secreted from placental cells. The peroxidase-like activity of Au-NPFe2O3NC was then used to accomplish an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-based sensing protocol for naked-eye observation along with UV-visible and electrochemical detection of PLAP-specific exosomes present in placental cell-conditioned media. We demonstrated excellent agreement in analytical performance for the detection of placental cell-derived exosomes (i.e., linear dynamic range, 103-107 exosomes/mL; limit of detection, 103 exosomes/mL; relative standard deviation (%RSD) of <5.5% for n = 3) using with and without commercial ""total exosome isolation kit""-based preisolation step.

However, owing to the tendency of those materials to have uncontrollable morphologies and to form large crystals, they cannot be utilized in discontinuous microminiaturization, which is crucial for practical optoelectronic applications. In this research, combining the effects of adding polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), precisely controlling the inkjet printing technique, and using a postprocessing procedure, we were able to fabricate in situ crystallized perovskite-PVP nanocomposite microarrays with perfect morphologies. The viscosity of the perovskite precursor increased with the addition of PVP, eliminating the outward capillary flow that induces the coffee-ring effect. In addition, because of the presence of metallic bonds with the C═O groups in PVP and the spatial confinement of such a polymer, we were able to fabricate regulated CsPbBr3 nanocrystals capped with PVP and with a uniform size distribution. The as-printed patterns showed excellent homogeneity on a macroscale and high reproducibility on a microscale; furthermore, those patterns were invisible in the ambient environment, compatible with flexible substrates, and cost-efficient to produce, indicating that this technique holds promising potential for applications such as anticounterfeiting labels.",Small Molecule SOS1 Agonists Modulate MAPK and PI3K Signaling via Independent Cellular Responses.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735352,ACS chemical biology,2019 03 15,"Activating mutations in RAS can lead to oncogenesis by enhancing downstream signaling, such as through the MAPK and PI3K pathways. Therefore, therapeutically targeting RAS may perturb multiple signaling pathways simultaneously. One method for modulating RAS signaling is to target the activity of the guanine nucleotide exchange factor SOS1. Our laboratory has discovered compounds that bind to SOS1 and activate RAS. Interestingly, these SOS1 agonist compounds elicit biphasic modulation of ERK phosphorylation and simultaneous inhibition of AKT phosphorylation levels. Here, we utilized multiple chemically distinct compounds to elucidate whether these effects on MAPK and PI3K signaling by SOS1 agonists were mechanistically linked. In addition, we used CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing to generate clonally derived SOS1 knockout cells and identified a potent SOS1 agonist that rapidly elicited on-target molecular effects at substantially lower concentrations than those causing off-target effects. Our findings will allow us to further define the on-target utility of SOS1 agonists.",Coherence and Density Dynamics of Excitons in a Single-Layer MoS2 Reaching the Homogeneous Limit.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735350,ACS nano,2019 05 22,"We measure the coherent nonlinear response of excitons in a single layer of molybdenum disulfide embedded in hexagonal boron nitride, forming a h-BN/MoS2/ h-BN heterostructure. Using four-wave mixing microscopy and imaging, we correlate the exciton inhomogeneous broadening with the homogeneous one and population lifetime. We find that the exciton dynamics is governed by microscopic disorder on top of the ideal crystal properties. Analyzing the exciton ultrafast density dynamics using amplitude and phase of the response, we investigate the relaxation pathways of the resonantly driven exciton population. The surface protection via encapsulation provides stable monolayer samples with low disorder, avoiding surface contaminations and the resulting exciton broadening and modifications of the dynamics. We identify areas localized to a few microns where the optical response is totally dominated by homogeneous broadening. Across the sample of tens of micrometers, weak inhomogeneous broadening and strain effects are observed, attributed to the remaining interaction with the h-BN and imperfections in the encapsulation process.",Remotely Controlled in Situ Growth of Silver Microwires Forming Bioelectronic Interfaces.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735349,ACS applied materials & interfaces,2019 06 14,"There is a pressing need to advance our ability to construct three-dimensional (3D) functional bioelectronic interfaces.

It enables controlled fabrication of conductive wires in a three-dimensional configuration. Moreover, we demonstrate that this technology could be used to grow and interface conductive conduits in situ with mammalian cells, offering a new strategy to engineering bioelectronic interfaces.

The nanostructural approach helps to lower thermal conductivity but has limited effect on the power factor. Here, we demonstrate selective charge Anderson localization as a route to maximize the Seebeck coefficient while simultaneously preserving high electrical conductivity and lowering the lattice thermal conductivity. We confirm the viability of interface potential modification in an n-type Bi-doped PbTe/Ag2Te nanocomposite and the resulting enhancement in thermoelectric figure-of-merit ZT. The introduction of random potentials via Ag2Te nanoparticle distribution using extrinsic phase mixing was determined using scanning tunneling spectroscopy measurements. When the Ag2Te undergoes a structural phase transition ( T > 420 K) from monoclinic β-Ag2Te to cubic α-Ag2Te, the band gap in the α-Ag2Te increases due to the p -d hybridization. This results in a decrease in the potential barrier height, which gives rise to partial delocalization of the electrons, while wave packets of the holes are still in a localized state. Using this strategic approach, we achieved an exceptionally high thermoelectric figure-of-merit in n-type PbTe materials, a ZT greater than 2.0, suitable for waste heat power generation.",Unraveling the Formation Mechanism of Solid-Liquid Electrolyte Interphases on LiPON Thin Films.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735347,ACS applied materials & interfaces,2019 03 08,"Most commercial lithium-ion batteries and other types of batteries rely on liquid electrolytes, which are preferred because of their high ionic conductivity, and facilitate fast charge-transfer kinetics at the electrodes. On the other hand, hybrid battery concepts that combine solid and liquid electrolytes might be needed to suppress unwanted shuttle effects in liquid electrolyte-only systems, in particular if mobile redox systems are involved in the cell chemistry. However, at the then newly introduced interface between liquid and solid electrolytes, a solid-liquid electrolyte interphase forms. In this study, we analyze the formation of such an interphase between the solid electrolyte lithium phosphorous oxide nitride (Li xPO yN z, ""LiPON"") and various liquid electrolytes using in situ neutron reflectometry, quartz crystal microbalance, and atomic force microscopy measurements. Our results show that the interphase consists of two layers: a nonconducting layer directly in contact with ""LiPON"" and a lithium-rich outer layer. Initially, a fast growth of the solid-liquid electrolyte interphase is observed, which slows down significantly afterward, resulting in a thickness of about 20 nm eventually. Here, a formation mechanism is proposed, which describes the solid-liquid electrolyte interphase growth as the fast deposition of a film, which mostly covers the ""LiPON"", with only a little degree of remaining porosity. The residual void space is then slowly filled, thus blocking the remaining channels for ionic conduction, which leads to increasing resistance of the interphase. The results obtained imply that hybrid battery concepts with liquid electrolyte and solid electrolyte can be hampered by highly resistive interphases, whose formation cannot be simply slowed down or suppressed.

While extensive structure-activity studies have demonstrated that these bacterial cell wall metabolites trigger NOD1- and NOD2-dependent signaling, their direct binding to these innate immune receptors or other proteins in mammalian cells has not been established. To characterize these fundamental microbial metabolite-host interactions, we synthesized a series of peptidoglycan metabolite photoaffinity reporters and evaluated their cross-linking to NOD1 and NOD2 in mammalian cells. We show that active iE-DAP and MDP photoaffinity reporters selectively cross-linked NOD1 and NOD2, respectively, and not their inactive mutants. We also discovered MDP reporter cross-linking to Arf GTPases, which interacted most prominently with GTP-bound Arf6 and coimmunoprecipitated with NOD2 upon MDP stimulation. Notably, MDP binding to NOD2 and Arf6 was abrogated with loss-of-function NOD2 mutants associated with Crohn's disease. Our studies demonstrate peptidoglycan metabolite photoaffinity reporters can capture their cognate immune receptors in cells and reveal unpredicted ligand-induced interactions with other cellular cofactors.

The porous structure and CO2-responsiveness of PDMAEMA brushes within the CNFs aerogels allowed for the on-off switching of the oil-water mixture separation process.

Here, we report the design, synthesis, and application of a new class of fluorescent voltage indicators that make use of a fluorene-based molecular wire as a voltage-sensing domain to provide fast and sensitive measurements of membrane potential in both mammalian neurons and human-derived cardiomyocytes. We show that the best of the new probes, fluorene VoltageFluor 2 (fVF 2), readily reports on action potentials in mammalian neurons, detects perturbations to the cardiac action potential waveform in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes, shows a substantial decrease in phototoxicity compared to existing molecular wire-based indicators, and can monitor cardiac action potentials for extended periods of time. Together, our results demonstrate the generalizability of a molecular wire approach to voltage sensing and highlight the utility of fVF 2 for interrogating membrane potential dynamics."

In preterm infants in cord blood decreased activity of the plasma level and functional activity of platelets, as well as reduced coagulation potential in General. After birth, premature newborns in the venous blood showed a slowdown in blood clotting, a decrease in the rate of formation and strength of clots. There is also a decrease in the functional activity of platelets, coagulation index and a more pronounced change in hemostatic potential in the direction of hypocoagulation.

The diagnostic and prognostic role of VEGFA in OC is controversial today. The aim of the study was to compare the serum level of VEGF, the cytoplasmic protein content and VEGF transcript in the tumor tissue of primary patients with advanced ovarian cancer and to analyze the relationship between these parameters and the response to standard polychemotherapy using the AP scheme. 82 primary patients with advanced OC were incladed in the study. The control group included 30 healthy women. All patients received adjuvant chemotherapy according to the AP scheme after surgery. The serum VEGF-A level was determined by direct immunoassay analysis ""Human VEGF ELISA Kit"" (""RayBiotech"", USA). Analysis of the VEGF transcript in tumor tissue was performed by PCR-RT using TaqMan® Gene Expression Assay (Thermo Scientific) probes, and for the data normalization the 18S and GAPDH referee genes were used. To calculate the IHC score of cytoplasmic expression of VEGF, immunohistochemical reactions were performed in paired samples of OC patients using antibodies (GeneTex, USA). For the genotyping of patients' DNA, test systems for the analysis of functional polymorphisms of the VEGF-A C12143A, G634C (LLC ""Sintol"", Moscow) were used. The level of VEGF-A in the serum of patients with OC was increased in comparison with the norm and depended on the response to chemotherapy according to the AP scheme. However, the specificity of this indicator is insufficient for use in prognostic purposes. There are no significant differences in the cytoplasmic expression of VEGF-A, depending on the response to chemotherapy. VEGF mRNA level was increased in 58% of patients. There was no correlation between serum VEGF levels and the transcript in the tumor tissue. Genotyping showed that the combination of genotypes of CC / GG reduces the risk of recurrence by 2.6 times.

In the case-control study, 740 volunteers participated in the study, which were divided into 3 groups: primary (lung cancer, n = 347), comparison group (non-malignant pulmonary pathologies, n = 178) and control (conditionally healthy, n = 215). Questioning, biochemical examination of saliva, histological verification of the diagnosis were conducted to all participants. The parameters of lipoperoxidation and antioxidant protection are determined spectrophotometrically. Intergroup differences are estimated by a nonparametric criterion. Against the background of lung cancer, the development of oxidative stress is observed, which is manifested in the increase in the level of lipid peroxidation products, as well as in the reduction of antioxidant protection in saliva. It is shown that the activity of the enzymes of the first link of antioxidant protection is significantly reduced (p<0.0001), whereas the activity of salivary peroxidases increases (p = 0.0037). The parameters of non-enzymatic protection vary in different directions: the level of uric acid in lung pathologies decreases (p = 0.0399), whereas albumin concentration increases, under these conditions, it begins to exhibit pro-oxidant properties. Differences between non-small cell and neuroendocrine lung cancer have been revealed by the nature of the dynamics of antioxidant protection indices. In general, the disturbance of the balance of the lipid peroxidation system and antioxidant protection is the result of a disruption in the coordination of immunometabolic processes and indicates a decrease in adaptive reactions of the organism.",[The efficiency of modernmethods of laboratory diagnosis in the evaluation of various forms of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome caused by the Puumala hantavirus (PUUV).],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735316,Klinicheskaia laboratornaia diagnostika,2019 03 23,We've conducted the analysis of both traditional and new methods of laboratory diagnosis to estimate the severity and damage of target organs during Hemorrhagic Fever with Renal Syndrome (HFRS).

More recently, research into this technique has shifted from simple discovery and demonstration of utility to application in biomedical research. Here, we describe a protocol utilizing MALDI-IMS for the spatial mapping of lipids in brain tissue from normal human brains and brains from patients with Alzheimer's disease, in the context of Alzheimer's disease. Improved accuracy calibration of the instrument from the tissue surface is emphasized, as this allows for significantly improved mass determination in time of flight (TOF)-based instruments enabling more confident preliminary lipid identification. This improved initial result allows MALDI-IMS data to be complemented with additional instrumentation, such as liquid chromatography mass spectrometry workflows or specialized non-TOF systems such as Fourier transform cyclotron resonance instruments.

The concept of two different types of innovation was explored: Crisis/Needs Driven and Value Driven. It was found that the case studies that mapped to the Crisis/Needs Driven innovation moved relatively quickly compared to Value Driven innovations and in most cases involved new entrants. New entrants refer to new companies or start-ups that have recently entered the water technology market. The case studies, which could be mapped to Value Driven innovation, had a slower rate of technology diffusion, and they involved a combination of existing companies as well as new entrants. PRACTITIONER POINTS: The paper identifies two key types of innovation: Crisis/Needs Driven and Value Driven. Legislation was observed to be a key driver for the adoption of new technology innovation in the water sector. The Crisis/Needs driven innovations studied were observed to diffuse through the Water Technology Diffusion model at up to twice the pace of Value driven innovation. Crisis/Needs driven innovation typically involves disruptive innovation offered by new entrants, whereas with Value driven innovation, the solutions are provided by both existing companies as well as new entrants. It is also observed that in most cases a technology that is adopted in order to meet a crisis or need in the market is more expensive at the outset compared with incumbent solutions. While value driven adoption has a slower cycle for adoption, it presents a lower risk as it is less dependent on external factors and timing of implementation of regulations or the occurrence of some public health related or environmental crisis.",Mercury removal from municipal secondary effluent with hydrous ferric oxide reactive filtration.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735297,Water environment research : a research publication of the Water Environment Federation,2019 05 10,"This study evaluated the ability of hydrous ferric oxide reactive filtration (HFO-RF) to remove mercury (Hg) from municipal secondary effluent at four study sites. Pilot HFO-RF systems (136 m3 /day) at two sites demonstrated total Hg concentration removal efficiencies of 96% (inflow/outflow mean total Hg: 43.6/1.6  ng/L) and 80% (4.2/0.8 ng/L). A lightly loaded medium-scale HFO-RF system (950 m3 /day) had a concentration removal efficiency of 53% (0.98/0.46 ng/L) and removed 0.52 mg/day of total Hg and 2.2 μg/day of methyl-Hg. A full-scale HFO-RF system (11,400 m3 /day) yielded a total Hg concentration removal efficiency of 97% (87/2.7 ng/L) and removed an estimated 0.36 kg/year of Hg. Results suggest that the quality of secondary effluent, including dissolved organic matter content, affects achievable minimum total Hg concentrations in effluent from HFO-RF systems. Low HFO-RF effluent concentrations (<1 ng/L) can be expected when treating secondary effluent from suspended-growth biological treatment systems. PRACTITIONER POINTS: Trace levels of mercury in municipal secondary effluent can negatively impact receiving waters. Hydrous ferric oxide reactive filtration (HFO-RF) can remove mercury from municipal secondary effluent to levels below the Great Lakes Initiative discharge standard of 1.3 ng/L. Mercury removal to low concentrations (< 1 ng/L) using HFO-RF appears to be associated with secondary effluents with low dissolved organic matter content. HFO-RF can also remove total phosphorus and turbidity to low concentrations.",Galvanic Replacement-Mediated Synthesis of Ni-Supported Pd Nanoparticles with Strong Metal-Support Interaction for Methanol Electro-oxidation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735296,"Small (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)",2019 03 15,"Herein, well-defined Pd nanoparticles (NPs) developed on Ni substrate (Pd NPs/Ni) are synthesized via a facile galvanic replacement reaction (GRR) route performed in ethaline-based deep eutectic solvent (DES). For comparison, a Pd NPs/Ni composite is also prepared by the GRR method conducted in an aqueous solution. The Pd NPs/Ni obtained from the ethaline-DES is catalytically more active and durable for the methanol electro-oxidation reaction (MOR) than those of the counterpart derived from conventional aqueous solution and commercial Pd/C under alkaline media. Detailed kinetic analysis indicates that the unique solvent environment offered by ethaline plays vital roles in adjusting the reactivity of the active species and their mass transport properties to control over the genesis of the Pd NPs/Ni nanocomposite. The resulting Pd NPs/Ni catalyst possesses a homogeneous dispersion of Pd NPs with a strong Pd (metal)-Ni (support) interaction. This structure enhances the charge transfer between the support and the active phases, and optimizes the adsorption energy of OH- and CO on the surface, leading to superior electrocatalytic performance. This work provides a novel GRR strategy performed in ethaline-DES to the rational design and construction of advanced metal/support catalysts with strong interaction for improving the activity and durability for MOR.",Aluminum-Tailored Energy Level and Morphology of Co3-x Alx O4 Porous Nanosheets toward Highly Efficient Electrocatalysts for Water Oxidation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735295,"Small (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)",2019 03 15,"Tuning energy levels plays a crucial role in developing cost-effective, earth-abundant, and highly active oxygen evolution catalysts.

In this experiment, inexpensive and feasible to be carried out in a single laboratory session, students have to make the decision of what method is the most suitable for a given analytical problem, anticipating situations that they will probably face throughout their professional careers. It not only illustrates basic issues related to the use of enzymes as reagents for enzymatic analyses and its application to food chemistry, but it is also used to put into practice some principles of statistical analysis and analytical methods evaluation. This can be achieved because students get results from two different enzymatic analysis protocols (kinetic and end-point methods) using a single reaction mixture.

While the basic idea, as well as experimental setup for this method, are fairly simple, there is still the room for advancing of data processing algorithms. Specifically, the conventional realizations of LASCA method may limit the spatial and/or temporal resolution and thus fail in the detection of very small contrast objects since they based on the fixed-size rectangular sliding window function. We suggest an alternative data processing algorithm based on the usage of the Gaussian sliding filter for a sequential determination of both spatial and temporal parts of the speckle contrast. The suggested replacement of conventional box filter leads to the monotonic damping of high-frequency spectral components that results in a better elimination of ringing and aliasing effects in the spatio-temporal speckle contrast outputs. Additionally, we show that such sliding filtration increases robustness with respect to the processing of a sequence of nonstabilised images.

Polystyrene substrates were sandblasted with 25, 50, and 150 μm aluminum oxide particles to obtain topographies with average Sa values of 0.6, 1.1, and 1.8 μm, respectively. 3D-SEM was used to evaluate substrate's topographies. Examination was done by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), by immunocytofluorescence (ICF) analysis for vinculin, Runx2 and collagen type I, and by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis for Runx2 and collagen type I. SEM and ICF analyses revealed that surface roughness caused cells elongation (2, 6, 8, 10 times for the NT, 0.6 μm, 1.1 μm, and 1.8 μm, respectively). Vinculin staining demonstrated how the Sa value affected cellular attachment to the substrate. FA points were randomly distributed on flat surfaces, but rough surfaces resulted in more concentrated FA points on the podia of the cells (11.7, 25.2, 26.7, 16.6 vinculin spots per 20 μm2 for the NT, 0.6 μm, 1.1 μm, and 1.8 μm, respectively). qRT-PCR revealed that Runx2 expression was highest on day 16 on surfaces with Sa of 0.6 μm and 1.1 μm. Collagen type I expression increased from day 0 to day 16, no significance was found among the groups. In conclusion, surface topography affects cell shape and expression of early osteogenic potential in OGC, particularly surfaces with Sa values of 0.6 μm and 1.1 μm which showed the highest concentration of FA points on podia.

In vitro MRS studies on PSC patients have limitations due to the contamination of bile with contrast agent (commonly administered during endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography) and/or the use of patient cohorts with other diseases as controls. The objective of this study was to quantify biliary metabolites using in vivo 1 H MRS and gain insight into the pathogenesis of PSC. Biliary metabolites in 10 PSC patients and 14 healthy controls were quantified in vivo using 1 H MRS on a 3 T MR scanner. The concentrations of total bile acids plus cholesterol, glycine-conjugated bile acids, taurine-conjugated bile acids, and choline-containing phospholipids (chol-PLs) were compared between the two groups. There were statistically significant decreases in the levels of the above mentioned biliary metabolites in the PSC patients compared with controls. The reduction in bile acid secretion in bile of PSC patients indicates accumulation of bile acids in hepatocytes. Moreover, reduction in the levels of chol-PLs in bile may increase the toxic effects of bile acids. Our findings suggest that the bile duct injury in PSC patients is most likely due to ""bile acid-induced injury.""",Comparative Study of Photoswitchable Zinc-Finger Domain and AT-Hook Motif for Light-Controlled Peptide-DNA Binding.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735272,"Chemistry (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)",2019 04 09,"DNA-peptide interactions are involved in key life processes, including DNA recognition, replication, transcription, repair, organization, and modification.

The goal of this study was to analyze historical data related to such events among wild fish populations in Minnesota in order to assess the quality and completeness of the data and potential trends in fish kills. After excluding events with incomplete data (e.g., in which the location was not reported), we analyzed 225 unique fish kills from 2003 to 2013 that were recorded in two Minnesota Department of Natural Resources databases. The most reported fish kills occurred during 2007 (n = 41) and during the month of June (n = 81) across all years. Centrarchid species were present in the most fish kills (138), followed by cyprinid and ictalurid species, which were present in 53 and 40 events, respectively. Environmental factors were the most common cause of death reported. Models of environmental factors revealed that the maximum nighttime land surface temperature was the most critical factor in fish mortality, followed by changes in primary productivity and human disturbances. During the course of this study, data gaps were identified, including underreporting, inconsistent investigation, and the lack of definitive diagnoses, making interpretation of our results challenging.

Currently, a detailed understanding of the skyrmion stabilization mechanisms is still lacking in these systems. To gain more insight, it is first and foremost essential to determine the full real-space spin configuration. Here, two advanced X-ray techniques are applied, based on magnetic circular dichroism, to investigate the spin textures of skyrmions in [Ta/CoFeB/MgO]n multilayers. First, by using ptychography, a high-resolution diffraction imaging technique, the 2D out-of-plane spin profile of skyrmions with a spatial resolution of 10 nm is determined. Second, by performing circular dichroism in resonant elastic X-ray scattering, it is demonstrated that the chirality of the magnetic structure undergoes a depth-dependent evolution. This suggests that the skyrmion structure is a complex 3D structure rather than an identical planar texture throughout the layer stack. The analyses of the spin textures confirm the theoretical predictions that the dipole-dipole interactions together with the external magnetic field play an important role in stabilizing sub-100 nm diameter skyrmions and the hybrid structure of the skyrmion domain wall. This combined X-ray-based approach opens the door for in-depth studies of magnetic skyrmion systems, which allows for precise engineering of optimized skyrmion heterostructures.",What matters in clinical trial decision-making: a systematic review of interviews exploring cancer patients' experiences.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735263,Scandinavian journal of caring sciences,2019 02 08,"Being diagnosed with cancer is an existential challenge and involves difficult treatment decisions, including treatment in clinical trials.

From November 2013 to June 2015, 636 faecal specimens from 169 elderly, mainly asymptomatic, living in nursing homes in Greater Lisbon and Faro district, Portugal, were collected. NoV and RVA were detected by real-time polymerase chain reaction and NoV genotyped by phylogenetic analysis. NoV detection rate was 7.1% (12 of 169). Three GI.3 and one GII.6 strains were genotyped. RVA detection rate was 3.6% (6 of 169), exclusively in asymptomatic individuals. Host genetic factors associated with infection susceptibility were described on 250 samples by saliva-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. The Lewis-negative phenotype was 8.8% (22 of 250) and the rate of nonsecretors was 16.8% (42 of 250).

However, neurons can maintain synaptic communication and signalling under resting conditions independently of activity. Importantly, these processes are regulated by Ca2+ signals that occur at rest. Several studies have suggested that opening of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels near resting membrane potentials, activation of NMDA receptors in the absence of depolarization or Ca2+ release from intracellular stores can drive neurotransmitter release as well as subsequent signalling in the absence of action potentials. Interestingly, recent studies have demonstrated that manipulation of resting neuronal Ca2+ signalling yielded pronounced homeostatic synaptic plasticity, suggesting a critical role for this resting form of signalling in regulation of synaptic efficacy and neuronal homeostasis. Given their robust impact on synaptic efficacy and neuronal signalling, neuronal resting Ca2+ signals warrant further mechanistic analysis that includes the potential role of store-operated Ca2+ entry in these processes.",Starting Up a Hospital at Home Program: Facilitators and Barriers to Implementation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735244,Journal of the American Geriatrics Society,2019 03 06,"Hospital at home (HaH) is a model of care that provides acute-level services in the home.

Therefore, increasing the integrity of the intestinal barrier by manipulating the TJ may constitute an innovative and effective therapeutic strategy in IBD. In this context, recent studies showed that dietary polyphenols are able to protect the intestinal TJ barrier integrity. Here, using a cellular model of intestinal inflammation, consisting of cytokine-stimulated HT-29 colon epithelial cells, we show that a polyphenolic extract obtained from Portuguese red wine (RWE) decreased the paracellular permeability across the cell monolayer compared with the control cells, even in the presence of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The beneficial effect of RWE was exerted at three complementary levels: (1) by promoting a significant increase of the mRNA of key barrier-forming TJ proteins, including occludin, claudin-5 and zonnula occludens (ZO)-1 above the levels observed in the control cells; (2) by preventing the decrease in the expression of these proteins under inflammatory conditions and (3) by averting the increase in claudin-2 mRNA, a channel-forming TJ protein induced by pro-inflammatory cytokines. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that polyphenols presented and consumed in red wine as a mixture can reinforce and protect the intestinal barrier against inflammatory stimulus by affecting the TJ protein expression and, thus, without the need for purifying individual compounds, might represent a readily available therapeutic intervention against IBD and intestinal inflammation.",Optical coherence tomography angiography and photoacoustic imaging in dermatology.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735220,Photochemical & photobiological sciences : Official journal of the European Photochemistry Association and the European Society for Photobiology,2019 05 16,"Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) is a relatively novel functional extension of the widely accepted ophthalmic imaging tool named optical coherence tomography (OCT).

However, the crystal structure in complex with the native substrate mevalonate, ATP and Mg2+ has not been resolved, which has limited the understanding of its reaction mechanism and therefore its application in the production of isoprenoid-based biofuels. Here using molecular docking, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and a hybrid QM/MM study, we revisited the location of Mg2+ resolved in the crystal structure of MVK and determined a catalytically competent MVK structure in complex with the native substrate mevalonate and ATP. We demonstrated that significant conformational change on a flexible loop connecting the α6 and α7 helix is induced by the substrate binding. Further, we found that Asp204 is coordinated to the Mg2+ ion. Arg241 plays a crucial role in organizing the triphosphoryl tail of ATP for in-line phosphate transfer and stabilizing the negative charge that accumulates at the β,γ-bridging oxygen of ATP upon bond cleavage. Remarkably, we revealed that the phosphorylation of mevalonate catalyzed by MVK occurs via a direct phosphorylation mechanism, instead of the conventionally postulated catalytic base mechanism. The catalytically competent complex structure of MVK as well as the mechanism of reaction will pave the way for the rational engineering of MVK to exploit its applications in the production of biofuels.",Stevioside attenuates isoproterenol-induced mouse myocardial fibrosis through inhibition of the myocardial NF-κB/TGF-β1/Smad signaling pathway.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735218,Food & function,2019 06 14,"Stevioside, a natural glycoside compound, has many beneficial biological activities, but its protective effect on myocardial fibrosis has not been reported yet.

We show that NMR spectroscopy can resolve solvent molecules and ions (here, in H2O, DMSO, and the battery electrolyte LIPF6:DC:EMC) in and outside of the pores of the Si substrate, allowing the diffusion coefficients of the ion/molecules in the two components to be individually determined. Exchange between ions/molecules inside and outside of the pores is observed with 1H 2D exchange spectroscopy (EXSY). The pore dimensions can extracted from the diffusivity of the in-pore component and the results are in reasonable agreement with the pore dimensions measured with electron microscopy. Better agreement is obtained for pore diameters; for pore length measurements, exchange between the in-pore and ex-pore solvents should be accounted for.

A graphene electrode and 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium thiocyanate ([EMIM]+[SCN]-) ionic liquid were used as a system for the EDLC. We clarify the ionic layer structure and show that an abrupt change of the ionic layers leads to a high differential capacitance of the EDLC. The charging simulations reveal that the charging dynamics of the EDLC is highly dependent on the rearrangement of the ionic layer structure. Particularly, the electrode charge during the charging process is consistent with the perpendicular displacement of ionic liquid molecules. From this property, we analyze the contribution of each molecular ion to the electrode charge stored during charging. Charging of the EDLC is largely dependent on the desorption of the co-ions from the electrode rather than the adsorption of the counter-ions. In addition, the contribution of bulk ions to the charge stored in the EDLC is as important as that of ions adjacent to the electrode surface contrary to the conventional viewpoint. From these results, we identify the charging mechanism of the EDLC and discuss the relevance to experimental results. Our findings in the present study are expected to play an important role in designing an efficient EDLC with a novel perspective on the charging of the EDLC.",Controllable design of double metal oxide (NiCo2O4)-modified CdS for efficient photocatalytic hydrogen production.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735215,Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP,2019 02 21,"In the present study, we have successfully synthesized a kind of high-efficiency NiCo2O4/CdS composite photocatalyst using the hydrothermal method and high-temperature calcination. With the addition of NiCo2O4, hydrogen evolution has been significantly improved by successfully adjusting the electron transport routes. For the composite catalyst, the maximum amount of hydrogen evolution under visible light irradiation for 5 hours reached 549 μmol. Through this phenomenon, the hydrogen production rate of the corresponding composite catalysts reached 10 980 μmol g-1 h-1. The hydrogen production rate of the composite catalysts is 5.1 times that of pure CdS under the same conditions. In addition, there was no significant decrease in the photocatalytic activity of the composite catalyst even after 5 cycles of photocatalytic hydrogen production. These phenomena indicate that the introduction of NiCo2O4 inhibits the photo-corrosion of CdS itself and enhances hydrogen production activity while ensuring the stability of the catalyst. In order to characterize the physical properties of the NiCo2O4/CdS composite catalyst, we used XRD, SEM, TEM, XPS, BET and UV-vis techniques. In photoelectron and hole transport mechanisms, we have studied the catalysts by photoluminescence spectroscopy, transient photocurrent and photoelectrochemical experiments.

Based on this, in this study we present a new method based on the Shepard interpolation, where the nodal functions are composed of a symmetric Gaussian term and an asymmetric exponential term in each dimension. Corresponding sampling methods were also developed. We tested the method on several atmospheric bimolecular clusters and achieved root mean square errors (RMSE) below 0.13 kJ mol-1 in 150 samples for Ar-rigid H2O and Ne-rigid CO2, and below 0.39 kJ mol-1 in 1800 samples for rigid N2-rigid CO2."

Locomotor training (LT) on a treadmill is widely used as a rehabilitation tool in the SCI population with many benefits and improvements to daily life. We utilize this method of activity-based task-specific training (ABT) in rodents after SCI to both elucidate the mechanisms behind such improvements and to enhance and improve upon existing clinical rehabilitation protocols. Our current goal is to determine the mechanisms underlying ABT-induced improvements in urinary, bowel, and sexual function in SCI rats after a moderate to severe level of contusion. After securing each individual animal in a custom-made adjustable vest, they are secured to a versatile body weight support mechanism, lowered to a modified three-lane treadmill and assisted in step-training for 58 minutes, once a day for 10 weeks. This setup allows for the training of both quadrupedal and forelimb-only animals, alongside two different non-trained groups. Quadrupedal-trained animals with body weight support are aided by a technician present to assist in stepping with proper hind limb placement as necessary, while forelimb-only trained animals are raised at the caudal end to ensure no hind limb contact with the treadmill and no weight-bearing. One non-trained SCI group of animals is placed in a harness and rests next to the treadmill, while the other control SCI group remains in its home cage in the training room nearby. This paradigm allows for the training of multiple SCI animals at once, thus making it more time-efficient in addition to ensuring that our pre-clinical animal model mimics the clinical representation as close as possible, particularly with respect to the body weight support with manual assistance.",Detection of Protease Activity by Fluorescent Peptide Zymography.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735202,Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,2019 02 08,"The purpose of this method is to measure the proteolytic activity of complex biological samples. The samples are separated by molecular weight using electrophoresis through a resolving gel embedded with a degradable substrate. This method differs from traditional gel zymography in that a quenched fluorogenic peptide is covalently incorporated into the resolving gel instead of full length proteins, such as gelatin or casein. Use of the fluorogenic peptides enables direct detection of proteolytic activity without additional staining steps. Enzymes within the biological samples cleave the quenched fluorogenic peptide, resulting in an increase in fluorescence. The fluorescent signal in the gels is then imaged with a standard fluorescent gel scanner and quantified using densitometry. The use of peptides as the degradable substrate greatly expands the possible proteases detectable with zymographic techniques.",Cell Fractionation of U937 Cells in the Absence of High-speed Centrifugation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735201,Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,2019 02 08,"In this protocol we detail a method to obtain subcellular fractions of U937 cells without the use of ultracentrifugation or indiscriminate detergents. This method utilizes hypotonic buffers, digitonin, mechanical lysis and differential centrifugation to isolate the cytoplasm, mitochondria and plasma membrane. The process can be scaled to accommodate the needs of researchers, is inexpensive and straightforward. This method will allow researchers to determine protein localization in cells without specialized centrifuges and without the use of commercial kits, both of which can be prohibitively expensive. We have successfully used this method to separate cytosolic, plasma membrane and mitochondrial proteins in the human monocyte cell line U937.",Assessing Stem Cell DNA Integrity for Cardiac Cell Therapy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735199,Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,2019 02 08,"Stem and stem-cell-derived cells have immense potential as a regenerative therapy for various degenerative diseases. DNA is the storehouse of genetic data in all cells, including stem cells, and its integrity is fundamental to its regenerative ability. Stem cells undergo rapid propagation in labs to achieve the necessary numbers for transplantation. Accelerated cell growth leads to the loss of DNA integrity by accumulated metabolites, such as reactive oxygen, carbonyl, and alkylating agents. Transplanting these cells would result in poor engraftment and regeneration of the deteriorating organ. Moreover, transplanting DNA-damaged cells leads to mutations, DNA instability, cellular senescence, and possibly, life-threatening diseases such as cancer. Therefore, there is an immediate need for a quality control method to evaluate the cell's suitability for transplantation. Here, we provide step-by-step protocols for the assessment of the DNA integrity of stem cells prior to cell transplantation.",A Stainless Protocol for High Quality RNA Isolation from Laser Capture Microdissected Purkinje Cells in the Human Post-Mortem Cerebellum.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735198,Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,2019 02 08,"Laser capture microdissection (LCM) is an advantageous tool that allows for the collection of cytologically and/or phenotypically relevant cells or regions from heterogenous tissues. Captured product can be used in a variety of molecular methods for protein, DNA or RNA isolation. However, preservation of RNA from postmortem human brain tissue is especially challenging. Standard visualization techniques for LCM require histologic or immunohistochemical staining procedures that can further degrade RNA. Therefore, we designed a stainless protocol for visualization in LCM with the intended purpose of preserving RNA integrity in post-mortem human brain tissue. The Purkinje cell of the cerebellum is a good candidate for stainless visualization, due to its size and characteristic location. The cerebellar cortex has distinct layers that differ in cell density, making them a good archetype to identify under high magnification microscopy. Purkinje cells are large neurons situated between the granule cell layer, which is a densely cellular network of small neurons, and the molecular layer, which is sparse in cell bodies. Because of this architecture, the use of stainless visualization is feasible. Other organ or cell systems that mimic this phenotype would also be suitable. The stainless protocol is designed to fix fresh-frozen tissue with ethanol and remove lipids with xylene for improved morphological visualization under high magnification light microscopy. This protocol does not account for other fixation methods and is specifically designed for fresh-frozen tissue samples captured using an ultraviolet (UV)-LCM system. Here, we present a full protocol for sectioning and fixing fresh frozen post-mortem human cerebellar tissue and purification of RNA from Purkinje cells isolated by UV-LCM, while preserving RNA quality for subsequent RNA-sequencing. In our hands, this protocol produces exceptional levels of cellular visualization without the need for staining reagents and yields RNA with high RNA integrity numbers (≥8) as needed for transcriptional profiling experiments.",Development and Implementation of a Multi-Disciplinary Technology Enhanced Care Pathway for Youth and Adults with Concussion.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735197,Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,2019 02 08,"The evidence-informed standardization of care along disease lines is recommended to improve outcomes and reduce healthcare costs. The aim of this project is to 1) describe the development and implementation of the Concussion Carepath, 2) demonstrate the process of integrating technology in the form of a mobile application to enable the carepath and guide clinical decision-making, and 3) present data on the utility of the C3 app in facilitating decision-making throughout the injury recovery process. A multi-disciplinary team of experts in concussion care was formed to develop an evidence-informed algorithm, outlining best practices for the clinical management of concussion along three phases of recovery - acute, subacute, and post-concussive. A custom mobile application, the Cleveland Clinic Concussion (C3) app was developed and validated to provide a platform for the systematic collection of objective, biomechanical outcomes and to provide guidance in clinical decision-making in the field and clinical environments. The Cleveland Clinic Concussion app included an electronic incident report, assessment modules to measure important aspects of cognitive and motor function, and a return to play module to systematically document the six phases of post-injury rehabilitation. The assessment modules served as qualifiers within the carepath algorithm, driving referral for specialty services as indicated. Overall, the carepath coupled with the C3 app functioned in unison to facilitate communication among the interdisciplinary team, prevent stagnant care, and drive patients to the right provider at the right time for efficient and effective clinical management.",Simultaneous Electrical and Mechanical Stimulation to Enhance Cells' Cardiomyogenic Potential.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735196,Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,2019 02 08,"Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death in developed countries. Consequently, the demand for effective cardiac cell therapies has motivated researchers in the stem cell and bioengineering fields to develop in vitro high-fidelity human myocardium for both basic research and clinical applications. However, the immature phenotype of cardiac cells is a limitation on obtaining tissues that functionally mimic the adult myocardium, which is mainly characterized by mechanical and electrical signals. Thus, the purpose of this protocol is to prepare and mature the target cell population through electromechanical stimulation, recapitulating physiological parameters. Cardiac tissue engineering is evolving toward more biological approaches, and strategies based on biophysical stimuli, thus, are gaining momentum. The device developed for this purpose is unique and allows individual or simultaneous electrical and mechanical stimulation, carefully characterized and validated. In addition, although the methodology has been optimized for this stimulator and a specific cell population, it can easily be adapted to other devices and cell lines. The results here offer evidence of the increased cardiac commitment of the cell population after electromechanical stimulation. Electromechanically stimulated cells show an increased expression of main cardiac markers, including early, structural, and calcium-regulating genes. This cell conditioning could be useful for further regenerative cell therapy, disease modeling, and high-throughput drug screening.",Identification of Mediators of T-cell Receptor Signaling via the Screening of Chemical Inhibitor Libraries.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735195,Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,2019 02 08,"The T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling pathway comprises a multitude of mediators that transmit signals upon the activation of the TCR. Different strategies have been proposed and implemented for the identification of new mediators of TCR signaling, which would improve the understanding of T-cell processes, including activation and thymic selection. We describe a screening assay that enables the identification of molecules that influence TCR signaling based on the activation of developing thymocytes. Strong TCR signals cause developing thymocytes to activate apoptotic machinery in a process known as negative selection. Through the application of kinase inhibitors, those with targets that affect TCR signaling are able to override the process of negative selection. The method detailed in this paper can be used to identify inhibitors of canonical kinases with established roles in the TCR signaling pathways and also inhibitors of new kinases yet to be established in the TCR signaling pathways. The screening strategy here can be applied to screens of higher throughput for the identification of novel druggable targets in TCR signaling.",Live Cell Analysis of Shear Stress on Pseudomonas aeruginosa Using an Automated Higher-Throughput Microfluidic System.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735194,Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,2019 04 11,"A higher-throughput microfluidic in vitro bioreactor coupled with fluorescence microscopy has been used to study bacterial biofilm growth and morphology, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa).

A detailed protocol will describe how to grow and seed PA01-EGFP cultures, how to set up the microscope and autorun, and conduct the image analysis to determine growth rate and morphological properties using a variety of shear forces that are controlled by the microfluidic device. This article will provide a detailed description of a technique to improve the study of PA01-EGFP biofilms which eventually can be applied towards other strains of bacteria, fungi, or algae biofilms using the microfluidic platform.",Monitoring Neuronal Survival via Longitudinal Fluorescence Microscopy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735193,Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,2019 06 15,"Standard cytotoxicity assays, which require the collection of lysates or fixed cells at multiple time points, have limited sensitivity and capacity to assess factors that influence neuronal fate. These assays require the observation of separate populations of cells at discrete time points. As a result, individual cells cannot be followed prospectively over time, severely limiting the ability to discriminate whether subcellular events, such as puncta formation or protein mislocalization, are pathogenic drivers of disease, homeostatic responses, or merely coincidental phenomena. Single-cell longitudinal microscopy overcomes these limitations, allowing the researcher to determine differences in survival between populations and draw causal relationships with enhanced sensitivity. This video guide will outline a representative workflow for experiments measuring single-cell survival of rat primary cortical neurons expressing a fluorescent protein marker. The viewer will learn how to achieve high-efficiency transfections, collect and process images enabling the prospective tracking of individual cells, and compare the relative survival of neuronal populations using Cox proportional hazards analysis."

Among them, the droplet interface bilayer has gained popularity; however, the large membrane size hinders the recording of low electrical background noise. We have established a contact bubble bilayer (CBB) method that combines the benefits of planar lipid bilayer and patch-clamp methods, such as the ability to vary the lipid composition and to manipulate the bilayer mechanics, respectively. Using the setup for conventional patch-clamp experiments, CBB-based experiments can be readily performed. In brief, an electrolyte solution in a glass pipette is blown into an organic solvent phase (hexadecane), and the pipette pressure is maintained to obtain a stable bubble size. The bubble is spontaneously lined with a lipid monolayer (pure lipids or mixed lipids), which is provided from liposomes in the bubbles. Next, the two monolayer-lined bubbles (~50 µm in diameter) at the tip of the glass pipettes are docked for bilayer formation. Introduction of channel-reconstituted liposomes into the bubble leads to the incorporation of channels in the bilayer, allowing for single-channel current recording with a signal-to-noise ratio comparable to that of patch-clamp recordings. CBBs with an asymmetric lipid composition are readily formed. The CBB is renewed repeatedly by blowing out the previous bubbles and forming new ones. Various chemical and physical perturbations (e.g., membrane perfusion and bilayer tension) can be imposed on the CBBs. Herein, we present the basic procedure for CBB formation.",Methanol Independent Expression by Pichia Pastoris Employing De-repression Technologies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735181,Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,2019 02 08,"Methanol is a well-established carbon source and inducer for efficient protein production employing Pichia pastoris (P. pastoris) as a host on micro-, lab and industrial scale. However, due to its toxicity and flammability, there is a desire to avoid methanol while maintaining the high productivity of P. pastoris. Small scale bioreactor cultivations (0.5-5 L working volume) are commonly used to evaluate a strain and its protein production characteristics since microscale cultivation in deep well plates can be hardly controlled or relies on expensive equipment. Furthermore, traditional protocols for the cultivation and induction of P. pastoris were established for constitutive expression or methanol induction and so far, no reliable protocols were described to screen P. pastoris expression strains with derepressible promoters in (controlled and monitored) parallel cultivations. To simplify such initial cultivations to characterize and compare new protein production strains, we established a simple shake flask cultivation system for methanol free expression that simulates bioreactor conditions including a constant slow glycerol feed and online monitoring, thereby coming closer to the real conditions in bioreactors compared to mostly applied small scale batch cultivations. To drive recombinant protein expression in P. pastoris, the carbon source repressed promoters PDC and PDF were applied. Polymer discs with embedded carbon source, releasing a constant amount of glycerol, assured a feed rate delivering the necessary energy for maintaining the promoters active while keeping the biomass generation low.",Measuring Global Cellular Matrix Metalloproteinase and Metabolic Activity in 3D Hydrogels.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735180,Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,2019 02 08,"Three-dimensional (3D) cell culture systems often more closely recapitulate in vivo cellular responses and functions than traditional two-dimensional (2D) culture systems. However, measurement of cell function in 3D culture is often more challenging. Many biological assays require retrieval of cellular material which can be difficult in 3D cultures. One way to address this challenge is to develop new materials that enable measurement of cell function within the material. Here, a method is presented for measurement of cellular matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity in 3D hydrogels in a 96-well format. In this system, a poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) hydrogel is functionalized with a fluorogenic MMP cleavable sensor. Cellular MMP activity is proportional to fluorescence intensity and can be measured with a standard microplate reader. Miniaturization of this assay to a 96-well format reduced the time required for experimental set up by 50% and reagent usage by 80% per condition as compared to the previous 24-well version of the assay. This assay is also compatible with other measurements of cellular function. For example, a metabolic activity assay is demonstrated here, which can be conducted simultaneously with MMP activity measurements within the same hydrogel. The assay is demonstrated with human melanoma cells encapsulated across a range of cell seeding densities to determine the appropriate encapsulation density for the working range of the assay. After 24 h of cell encapsulation, MMP and metabolic activity readouts were proportional to cell seeding density. While the assay is demonstrated here with one fluorogenic degradable substrate, the assay and methodology could be adapted for a wide variety of hydrogel systems and other fluorescent sensors. Such an assay provides a practical, efficient and easily accessible 3D culturing platform for a wide variety of applications.",Optimized Interferon-gamma ELISpot Assay to Measure T Cell Responses in the Guinea Pig Model after Vaccination.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735179,Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,2019 02 08,"The guinea pig has played a pivotal role as a relevant small animal model in the development of vaccines for infectious diseases such as tuberculosis, influenza, diphtheria, and viral hemorrhagic fevers. We have demonstrated that plasmid-DNA (pDNA) vaccine delivery into the skin elicits robust humoral responses in the guinea pig. However, the use of this animal to model immune responses was somewhat limited in the past due to the lack of available reagents and protocols to study T cell responses. T cells play a pivotal role in both immunoprophylactic and immunotherapeutic mechanisms. Understanding T cell responses is crucial for the development of infectious disease and oncology vaccines and accommodating delivery devices. Here we describe an interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISpot) assay for guinea pig peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). The assay enables researchers to characterize vaccine-specific T-cell responses in this important rodent model. The ability to assay cells isolated from the peripheral blood provides the opportunity to track immunogenicity in individual animals.",Low-cost Protocol of Footprint Analysis and Hanging Box Test for Mice Applied the Chronic Restraint Stress.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735178,Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,2019 02 08,"Gait disturbance is frequently observed in patients with movement disorders. In mouse models used for movement disorders, gait analysis is important behavioral test to determine whether the mice mimic the symptoms of patients. Motor deficits are often induced by stress when no spontaneous motor phenotype is observed in the mouse models. Therefore, gait analysis followed by stress loading would be a sensitive method for evaluating the motor phenotype in mouse models. However, researchers face the requirement of an expensive apparatus to obtain quantitative results automatically from gait analysis. For stress, stress loading by simple methods without expensive apparatuses required for electric shock and forced running is desirable. Therefore, we introduce a simple and low-cost protocol consisting of footprint analysis with paper and ink, hanging box test to evaluate motor function, and stress loading defined by restraint with a conical tube. The motor deficits of mice were successfully detected by this protocol.",Automated Multiplex Immunofluorescence Panel for Immuno-oncology Studies on Formalin-fixed Carcinoma Tissue Specimens.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735177,Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,2019 02 08,"Continued developments in immuno-oncology require an increased understanding of the mechanisms of cancer immunology. The immunoprofiling analysis of tissue samples from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) biopsies has become a key tool for understanding the complexity of tumor immunology and discovering novel predictive biomarkers for cancer immunotherapy. Immunoprofiling analysis of tissues requires the evaluation of combined markers, including inflammatory cell subpopulations and immune checkpoints, in the tumor microenvironment. The advent of novel multiplex immunohistochemical methods allows for a more efficient multiparametric analysis of single tissue sections than does standard monoplex immunohistochemistry (IHC). One commercially available multiplex immunofluorescence (IF) method is based on tyramide-signal amplification and, combined with multispectral microscopic analysis, allows for a better signal separation of diverse markers in tissue. This methodology is compatible with the use of unconjugated primary antibodies that have been optimized for standard IHC on FFPE tissue samples. Herein we describe in detail an automated protocol that allows multiplex IF labeling of carcinoma tissue samples with a six-marker multiplex antibody panel comprising PD-L1, PD-1, CD68, CD8, Ki-67, and AE1/AE3 cytokeratins with 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole as a nuclear cell counterstain. The multiplex panel protocol is optimized in an automated IHC stainer for a staining time that is shorter than that of the manual protocol and can be directly applied and adapted by any laboratory investigator for immuno-oncology studies on human FFPE tissue samples. Also described are several controls and tools, including a drop-control method for fine quality control of a new multiplex IF panel, that are useful for the optimization and validation of the technique.",Handling and Assessment of Human Primary Prostate Organoid Culture.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735176,Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,2019 02 08,"This paper describes a detailed protocol for three-dimensional (3D) culturing, handling, and evaluation of human primary prostate organoids. The process involves seeding of epithelial cells sparsely in a 3D matrix gel on a 96-well microplate with media changes to cultivate expansion into organoids. Morphology is then assessed by whole-well capturing of z-stack images. Compression of z-stacks creates a single in-focus image from which organoids are measured to quantify a variety of outputs, including circularity, roundness, and area.DNA, RNA, and protein can be collected from organoids recovered from the matrix gel. Cell populations of interest can be assessed by organoid dissociation and flow cytometry. Formalin-fixation-paraffin-embedding (FFPE) followed by sectioning is used for the histological assessment and antibody staining. Whole-mount immunofluorescent staining preserves organoid morphology and facilitates observation of protein localization in organoids in situ. Commercial assays that are traditionally used for 2D monolayer cells can be modified for 3D organoids. Used together, the techniques in this protocol provide a robust toolbox to quantify prostate organoid growth, morphologic characteristics, and expression of differentiation markers.",Isolation of F1-ATPase from the Parasitic Protist Trypanosoma brucei.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735175,Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,2019 02 08,"F1-ATPase is a membrane-extrinsic catalytic subcomplex of F-type ATP synthase, an enzyme that uses the proton motive force across biological membranes to produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The isolation of the intact F1-ATPase from its native source is an essential prerequisite to characterize the enzyme's protein composition, kinetic parameters, and sensitivity to inhibitors. A highly pure and homogeneous F1-ATPase can be used for structural studies, which provide insight into molecular mechanisms of ATP synthesis and hydrolysis. This article describes a procedure for the purification of the F1-ATPase from Trypanosoma brucei, the causative agent of African trypanosomiases. The F1-ATPase is isolated from mitochondrial vesicles, which are obtained by hypotonic lysis from in vitro cultured trypanosomes. The vesicles are mechanically fragmented by sonication and the F1-ATPase is released from the inner mitochondrial membrane by the chloroform extraction. The enzymatic complex is further purified by consecutive anion exchange and size-exclusion chromatography. Sensitive mass spectrometry techniques showed that the purified complex is devoid of virtually any protein contaminants and, therefore, represents suitable material for structure determination by X-ray crystallography or cryo-electron microscopy. The isolated F1-ATPase exhibits ATP hydrolytic activity, which can be inhibited fully by sodium azide, a potent inhibitor of F-type ATP synthases. The purified complex remains stable and active for at least three days at room temperature. Precipitation by ammonium sulfate is used for long-term storage. Similar procedures have been used for the purification of F1-ATPases from mammalian and plant tissues, yeasts, or bacteria. Thus, the presented protocol can serve as a guideline for the F1-ATPase isolation from other organisms.",Genetic Engineering of Dictyostelium discoideum Cells Based on Selection and Growth on Bacteria.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735174,Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,2019 02 08,"Dictyostelium discoideum is an intriguing model organism for the study of cell differentiation processes during development, cell signaling, and other important cellular biology questions. The technologies available to genetically manipulate Dictyostelium cells are well-developed. Transfections can be performed using different selectable markers and marker re-cycling, including homologous recombination and insertional mutagenesis. This is supported by a well-annotated genome. However, these approaches are optimized for axenic cell lines growing in liquid cultures and are difficult to apply to non-axenic wild-type cells, which feed only on bacteria. The mutations that are present in axenic strains disturb Ras signaling, causing excessive macropinocytosis required for feeding, and impair cell migration, which confounds the interpretation of signal transduction and chemotaxis experiments in those strains. Earlier attempts to genetically manipulate non-axenic cells have lacked efficiency and required complex experimental procedures. We have developed a simple transfection protocol that, for the first time, overcomes these limitations. Those series of large improvements to Dictyostelium molecular genetics allow wild-type cells to be manipulated as easily as standard laboratory strains. In addition to the advantages for studying uncorrupted signaling and motility processes, mutants that disrupt macropinocytosis-based growth can now be readily isolated. Furthermore, the entire transfection workflow is greatly accelerated, with recombinant cells that can be generated in days rather than weeks. Another advantage is that molecular genetics can further be performed with freshly isolated wild-type Dictyostelium samples from the environment. This can help to extend the scope of approaches used in these research areas.",Spontaneous Formation and Rearrangement of Artificial Lipid Nanotube Networks as a Bottom-Up Model for Endoplasmic Reticulum.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735173,Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,2019 02 08,"We present a convenient method to form a bottom-up structural organelle model for the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The model consists of highly dense lipidic nanotubes that are, in terms of morphology and dynamics, reminiscent of ER. The networks are derived from phospholipid double bilayer membrane patches adhering to a transparent Al2O3 substrate. The adhesion is mediated by Ca2+ in the ambient buffer. Subsequent depletion of Ca2+ by means of BAPTA/EDTA causes retraction of the membrane, resulting in spontaneous lipid nanotube network formation. The method only comprises phospholipids and microfabricated surfaces for simple formation of an ER model and does not require the addition of proteins or chemical energy (e.g., GTP or ATP). In contrast to the 3D morphology of the cellular endoplasmic reticulum, the model is two-dimensional (albeit the nanotube dimensions, geometry, structure, and dynamics are maintained). This unique in vitro ER model consists of only a few components, is easy to construct, and can be observed under a light microscope. The resulting structure can be further decorated for additional functionality, such as the addition of ER-associated proteins or particles to study transport phenomena among the tubes. The artificial networks described here are suitable structural models for the cellular ER, whose unique characteristic morphology has been shown to be related to its biological function, whereas details regarding formation of the tubular domain and rearrangements within are still not completely understood. We note that this method uses Al2O3 thin-film-coated microscopy coverslips, which are commercially available but require special orders. Therefore, it is advisable to have access to a microfabrication facility for preparation."

However, these technological advancements yield high-dimensional data sets that have become increasingly difficult to analyze objectively within traditional manual-based gating programs. In order to better analyze and present data, scientists partner with bioinformaticians with expertise in analyzing high-dimensional data to parse their flow cytometry data. While these methods have been shown to be highly valuable in studying flow cytometry, they have yet to be incorporated in a straightforward and easy-to-use package for scientists who lack computational or programming expertise. To address this need, we have developed ExCYT, a MATLAB-based Graphical User Interface (GUI) that streamlines the analysis of high-dimensional flow cytometry data by implementing commonly employed analytical techniques for high-dimensional data including dimensionality reduction by t-SNE, a variety of automated and manual clustering methods, heatmaps, and novel high-dimensional flow plots. Additionally, ExCYT provides traditional gating options of select populations of interest for further t-SNE and clustering analysis as well as the ability to apply gates directly on t-SNE plots. The software provides the additional advantage of working with either compensated or uncompensated FCS files. In the event that post-acquisition compensation is required, the user can choose to provide the program a directory of single stains and an unstained sample. The program detects positive events in all channels and uses this select data to more objectively calculate the compensation matrix. In summary, ExCYT provides a comprehensive analysis pipeline to take flow cytometry data in the form of FCS files and allow any individual, regardless of computational training, to use the latest algorithmic approaches in understanding their data.",Generation and On-Demand Initiation of Acute Ictal Activity in Rodent and Human Tissue.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735161,Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,2019 02 08,"Controlling seizures remains a challenging issue for the medical community. To make progress, researchers need a way to extensively study seizure dynamics and investigate its underlying mechanisms. Acute seizure models are convenient, offer the ability to perform electrophysiological recordings, and can generate a large volume of electrographic seizure-like (ictal) events. The promising findings from acute seizure models can then be advanced to chronic epilepsy models and clinical trials. Thus, studying seizures in acute models that faithfully replicate the electrographic and dynamical signatures of a clinical seizure will be essential for making clinically relevant findings. Studying ictal events in acute seizure models prepared from human tissue is also important for making findings that are clinically relevant. The key focus in this paper is on the cortical 4-AP model due to its versatility in generating ictal events in both in vivo and in vitro studies, as well as in both mouse and human tissue. The methods in this paper will also describe an alternative method of seizure induction using the Zero-Mg2+ model and provide a detailed overview of the advantages and limitations of the epileptiform-like activity generated in the different acute seizure models. Moreover, by taking advantage of commercially available optogenetic mouse strains, a brief (30 ms) light pulse can be used to trigger an ictal event identical to those occurring spontaneously. Similarly, 30 - 100 ms puffs of neurotransmitters (Gamma-Amino Butyric Acid or glutamate) can be applied to the human tissue to trigger ictal events that are identical to those occurring spontaneously. The ability to trigger ictal events on-demand in acute seizure models offers the newfound ability to observe the exact sequence of events that underlie seizure initiation dynamics and efficiently evaluate potential anti-seizure therapies.",The HoneyComb Paradigm for Research on Collective Human Behavior.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735160,Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,2019 02 08,"Collective human behavior such as group movement frequently shows surprising patterns and regularities, such as the emergence of leadership. Recent literature has revealed that these patterns, often visible at the global level of the group, are based on self-organized, individual behaviors that follow several simple local parameters. Understanding the dynamics of human collective behavior can help to improve coordination and leadership in group and crowd scenarios, such as identifying the ideal placement and number of emergency exits in buildings. In this article, we present the experimental paradigm HoneyComb, which can be used to systematically investigate conditions and effects of human collective behavior. This paradigm uses a computer-based multi-user platform, providing a setting that can be shaped and adapted to various types of research questions. Situational conditions (e.g., cost-benefit ratios for specific behavior, monetary incentives and resources, various degrees of uncertainty) can be set by experimenters, depending on the research question. Each participant's motions are recorded by the server as hexagonal coordinates with timestamps at an accuracy of 50 ms and with individual IDs. Thus, a metric can be defined on the playfield, and movement parameters (e.g., distances, velocity, clustering, etc.) of participants can be measured over time. Movement data can in turn be combined with non-computerized data from questionnaires garnered within the same experiment setup. The HoneyComb paradigm is paving the way for new types of human movement experiments. We demonstrate here that these experiments can render results with sufficient internal validity to meaningfully deepen our understanding of human collective behavior.",Gene-therapy Inspired Polycation Coating for Protection of DNA Origami Nanostructures.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735159,Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,2019 02 08,"DNA origami nanostructures hold an immense potential to be used for biological and medical applications. However, low-salt conditions and nucleases in physiological fluids induce denaturation and degradation of self-assembled DNA nanostructures. In non-viral gene delivery, enzymatic degradation of DNA is overcome by the encapsulation of the negatively charged DNA in a cationic shell. Herein, inspired by gene delivery advancements, a simple, one-step and robust methodology is presented for the stabilization of DNA origami nanostructures by coating them with chitosan and linear polyethyleneimine. The polycation coating efficiently protects DNA origami nanostructures in Mg-depleted and nuclease-rich media. This method also preserves the full addressability of enzyme- and aptamer-based functionalization of DNA nanostructures.",High Throughput In Vitro Assessment of Latency Reversing Agents on HIV Transcription and Splicing.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735158,Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,2019 02 08,"HIV remains incurable due to the existence of a reservoir of cells that harbors stable and latent form of the virus, which stays invisible to the immune system and is not targeted by the current antiretroviral therapy (cART). Transcription and splicing have been shown to reinforce HIV-1 latency in resting CD4+ T cells. Reversal of latency by the use of latency reversal agents (LRAs) in the ""shock and kill"" approach has been studied extensively in an attempt to purge this reservoir but has thus far not shown any success in clinical trials due to the lack of development of adequate small molecules that can efficiently perturb this reservoir. The protocol presented here provides a method for reliably and efficiently assessing latency reversal agents (LRAs) on HIV transcription and splicing. This approach is based on the use of an LTR-driven dual color reporter that can simultaneously measure the effect of an LRA on transcription and splicing by flow cytometry. The protocol described here is adequate for adherent cells as well as the cells in suspension. It is useful for testing a large number of drugs in a high throughput system. The method is technically simple to implement and cost-effective. In addition, the use of flow cytometry allows the assessment of cell viability and thus drug toxicity at the same time.",Non-invasive Assessment of Dorsiflexor Muscle Function in Mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735157,Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,2019 02 08,"Assessment of skeletal muscle contractile function is an important measurement for both clinical and research purposes. Numerous conditions can negatively affect skeletal muscle. This can result in a loss of muscle mass (atrophy) and/or loss of muscle quality (reduced force per unit of muscle mass), both of which are prevalent in chronic disease, muscle-specific disease, immobilization, and aging (sarcopenia). Skeletal muscle function in animals can be evaluated by a range of different tests. All tests have limitations related to the physiological testing environment, and the selection of a specific test often depends on the nature of the experiments. Here, we describe an in vivo, non-invasive technique involving a helpful and easy assessment of force frequency-curve (FFC) in mice that can be performed on the same animal over time. This permits monitoring of disease progression and/or efficacy of a potential therapeutic treatment.",Inkjet Printing All Inorganic Halide Perovskite Inks for Photovoltaic Applications.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735156,Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,2019 02 08,"A method for synthesizing photoactive inorganic perovskite quantum dot inks and an inkjet printer deposition method, using the synthesized inks, are demonstrated.

The goal of the developed protocol is to construct and operate a sitting platform that can be passively destabilized while an inertial measurement unit quantifies its motion and vibrating elements deliver tactile feedback to the user. Interchangeable seat attachments alter the stability level of the device to safely challenge sitting balance. A built-in microcontroller allows fine-tuning of the feedback parameters to augment sensory function. Posturographic measures, typical of balance assessment protocols, summarize the motion signals acquired during timed balance trials. No dynamic sitting protocol to date provides variable challenge, quantification, and sensory feedback free of laboratory constraints. Our results demonstrate that non-disabled users of the device exhibit significant changes in posturographic measures when balance difficulty is altered or vibrational feedback provided. The portable, versatile device has potential applications in rehabilitation (following skeletal, muscular, or neurological injury), training (for sports or spatial awareness), entertainment (via virtual or augmented reality), and research (of sitting-related disorders).",Visualizing Adhesion Formation in Cells by Means of Advanced Spinning Disk-Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence Microscopy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735154,Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,2019 02 08,"In living cells, processes such as adhesion formation involve extensive structural changes in the plasma membrane and the cell interior. In order to visualize these highly dynamic events, two complementary light microscopy techniques that allow fast imaging of live samples were combined: spinning disk microscopy (SD) for fast and high-resolution volume recording and total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy for precise localization and visualization of the plasma membrane. A comprehensive and complete imaging protocol will be shown for guiding through sample preparation, microscope calibration, image formation and acquisition, resulting in multi-color SD-TIRF live imaging series with high spatio-temporal resolution. All necessary image post-processing steps to generate multi-dimensional live imaging datasets, i.e. registration and combination of the individual channels, are provided in a self-written macro for the open source software ImageJ. The imaging of fluorescent proteins during initiation and maturation of adhesion complexes, as well as the formation of the actin cytoskeletal network, was used as a proof of principle for this novel approach. The combination of high resolution 3D microscopy and TIRF provided a detailed description of these complex processes within the cellular environment and, at the same time, precise localization of the membrane-associated molecules detected with a high signal-to-background ratio.",Creation of Colonic Anastomosis in Mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735153,Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,2019 02 08,"Intestinal anastomoses are commonly performed in both elective and emergent operations.

Currently, there remains a paucity of data detailing the cellular mechanisms of anastomotic healing. Devising preventative strategies and treatment modalities for anastomotic leak could be greatly potentiated by a better understanding of appropriate anastomotic healing. A murine model is ideal as previous studies have shown that the murine anastomosis is the most clinically similar to the human case as compared with other animal models. We offer an easily reproducible murine model of colonic anastomosis in mice that will allow for further illustration of anastomotic healing."

Although this is a well-established paradigm, the bacterial factors required for fatty acid import are poorly understood. Previously, we found that LucA and Mce1 are required for fatty acid import in Mtb (Nazarova et al., 2017). Here, we identified additional Mtb mutants that have a reduced ability to import a fluorescent fatty acid substrate during infection within macrophages. This screen identified the novel genes as rv2799 and rv0966c as be necessary for fatty acid import and confirmed the central role for Rv3723/LucA and putative components of the Mce1 fatty acid transporter (Rv0200/OmamB, Rv0172/Mce1D, and Rv0655/MceG) in this process.",PUMILIO hyperactivity drives premature aging of Norad-deficient mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735131,eLife,2019 03 29,"Although numerous long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been identified, our understanding of their roles in mammalian physiology remains limited. Here, we investigated the physiologic function of the conserved lncRNA Norad in vivo. Deletion of Norad in mice results in genomic instability and mitochondrial dysfunction, leading to a dramatic multi-system degenerative phenotype resembling premature aging. Loss of tissue homeostasis in Norad-deficient animals is attributable to augmented activity of PUMILIO proteins, which act as post-transcriptional repressors of target mRNAs to which they bind. Norad is the preferred RNA target of PUMILIO2 (PUM2) in mouse tissues and, upon loss of Norad, PUM2 hyperactively represses key genes required for mitosis and mitochondrial function. Accordingly, enforced Pum2 expression fully phenocopies Norad deletion, resulting in rapid-onset aging-associated phenotypes. These findings provide new insights and open new lines of investigation into the roles of noncoding RNAs and RNA binding proteins in normal physiology and aging.",Venous endothelin modulates responsiveness of cardiac sympathetic axons to arterial semaphorin.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735130,eLife,2019 03 01,"Developing neurons of the peripheral nervous system reach their targets via cues that support directional growth, a process known as axon guidance. In investigating how sympathetic axons reach the heart in mice, we discovered that a combination of guidance cues are employed in sequence to refine axon outgrowth, a process we term second-order guidance. Specifically, endothelin-1 induces sympathetic neurons expressing the receptor Ednra to project to the vena cavae leading to the heart. Endothelin signaling in turn induces expression of the repulsive receptor Plexin-A4, via induction of the transcription factor MEF2C. In the absence of endothelin or plexin signaling, sympathetic neurons misproject to incorrect competing vascular trajectories (the dorsal aorta and intercostal arteries). The same anatomical and physiological consequences occur in Ednra+/-; Plxna4+/- double heterozygotes, genetically confirming functional interaction. Second-order axon guidance therefore multiplexes a smaller number of guidance cues in sequential fashion, allowing precise refinement of axon trajectories.",Brain-wide cellular resolution imaging of Cre transgenic zebrafish lines for functional circuit-mapping.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735129,eLife,2019 03 05,"Decoding the functional connectivity of the nervous system is facilitated by transgenic methods that express a genetically encoded reporter or effector in specific neurons; however, most transgenic lines show broad spatiotemporal and cell-type expression. Increased specificity can be achieved using intersectional genetic methods which restrict reporter expression to cells that co-express multiple drivers, such as Gal4 and Cre. To facilitate intersectional targeting in zebrafish, we have generated more than 50 new Cre lines, and co-registered brain expression images with the Zebrafish Brain Browser, a cellular resolution atlas of 264 transgenic lines. Lines labeling neurons of interest can be identified using a web-browser to perform a 3D spatial search (zbbrowser.com).

Here, we made optogenetically guided recordings from L5 corticofugal (CF) and L6 corticothalamic (CT) neurons in the auditory cortex of awake mice to discern differences in sensory processing and underlying patterns of functional connectivity. Whereas L5 CF neurons showed broad stimulus selectivity with sluggish response latencies and extended temporal non-linearities, L6 CTs exhibited sparse selectivity and rapid temporal processing. L5 CF spikes lagged behind neighboring units and imposed weak feedforward excitation within the local column. By contrast, L6 CT spikes drove robust and sustained activity, particularly in local fast-spiking interneurons. Our findings underscore a duality among sub-cortical projection neurons, where L5 CF units are canonical broadcast neurons that integrate sensory inputs for transmission to distributed downstream targets, while L6 CT neurons are positioned to regulate thalamocortical response gain and selectivity.",Specification of diverse cell types during early neurogenesis of the mouse cerebellum.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735127,eLife,2019 05 08,"We applied single-cell RNA sequencing to profile genome-wide gene expression in about 9400 individual cerebellar cells from the mouse embryo at embryonic day 13.5.

Together, our data revealed cell-specific markers for studying the cerebellum, gene-expression cascades underlying cell fate specification, and a number of previously unknown subpopulations that may play an integral role in the formation and function of the cerebellum.

Outcome of sepsis critically depends on macrophage activation by extracellular ATP-release and associated autocrine signalling via purinergic receptors. ATP-release mechanisms, however, are poorly understood. Here, we show that TLR-2 and -4 agonists trigger ATP-release via Connexin-43 hemichannels in macrophages leading to poor sepsis survival. In humans, Connexin-43 was upregulated on macrophages isolated from the peritoneal cavity in patients with peritonitis but not in healthy controls. Using a murine peritonitis/sepsis model, we identified increased Connexin-43 expression in peritoneal and hepatic macrophages. Conditional Lyz2cre/creGja1flox/flox mice were developed to specifically assess Connexin-43 impact in macrophages. Both macrophage-specific Connexin-43 deletion and pharmacological Connexin-43 blockade were associated with reduced cytokine secretion by macrophages in response to LPS and CLP, ultimately resulting in increased survival. In conclusion, inhibition of autocrine Connexin-43-dependent ATP signalling on macrophages improves sepsis outcome."

Background:
 Glove perforation is common during surgery. Surgical gloves are used as personal protective equipment to reduce infection risks from bloodborne pathogens for both the surgical team and patients. This research was conducted to determine the perforation rates of gloves worn in open abdominal surgery performed in a general surgery department and the risk factors affecting perforation.

 This research was designed as an observational prospective cohort study including 70 open abdominal operations. There were four members of the surgical team (surgeon, first assistant, second assistant, and scrub nurse). A total of 280 (70 × 4) pairs of gloves in 70 consecutive open abdominal procedures were included in this study. A total of 140 unused gloves were tested as control group to assess perforations and pre-existing leaks. After the operation, all gloves were checked for water impermeability using the EN455-1 method and the presence or absence of a puncture hole was recorded. 
Results:
 Glove perforation was detected in 54.3% of operations. The rate of perforation in all gloves was 10.7%, of which 78% unnoticed by the surgical team during surgical procedure. It was determined that the puncture in the gloves was mostly on the non-dominant hand (left). For the left-hand glove, the highest number of holes was observed on the index finger (21.1%) and palm/dorsum of the hand (21.1%). The risk of glove perforation was 5.8 times greater for surgeons compared with the other team members, and operation time of 61 minutes or longer increased the risk of perforation by 12.77 times. 
Conclusions:
 Glove perforation rates are high in open abdominal surgery. The highest number of perforations occurred in the non-dominant hand (left) has a high rate of perforation in surgeons and long operations. It may be beneficial for surgical team members to change gloves at certain intervals during surgery or use indicator glove systems.",Increased expression of CD40/TRAF1 and activation of nuclear factor-κκB-dependent proinflammatory gene expression in collagen-induced arthritis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735108,Scandinavian journal of rheumatology,2019 03 04,"Genetic studies have implicated both CD40 and tumour necrosis factor receptor-associated factor-1 (TRAF1) with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

Theory suggests that experiencing violence in childhood plays a role in propensity to perpetrate violence or vulnerability to violence in adulthood. Most research to date on this topic has been conducted in high-resource countries or within urban or high-risk populations. We explore the relationship between violence in childhood and violence in adulthood in a community-based sample of 18- to 49-year-old adults in rural South Africa using data from a population-based survey ( N = 1,044) in North West province in 2014. We measured childhood violence before age 15 years, experience of nonpartner sexual violence in adulthood, and IPV victimization and perpetration in the last 12 months. We conducted multivariate logistic regression; gender was tested as an effect modifier. All estimates are weighted to the subdistrict population. More women (2.7%) than men (0.8%) reported childhood forced sex, whereas fewer women (2.0%) than men (7.9%) reported childhood physical violence. Women and men reported similar rates of IPV victimization (6.8% vs. 5.4%), IPV perpetration (3.3% vs. 4.8%), and forced sex by a nonpartner (1.6% vs. 1.2%). We found that men and women who experienced childhood violence (combined physical and/or sexual) were significantly more likely to experience forced sex by a nonpartner (men: adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 5.53, 95% confidence interval [CI] = [1.27, 24.0], p < .05; women: aOR = 51.1, 95% CI = [10.58, 246.3], p < .01) compared with those who did not experience childhood violence. They were also 2.5 times as likely to perpetrate recent IPV (aOR = 2.5, 95% CI = [0.97, 6.7], p = .06) or experience recent IPV (aOR = 2.5, 95% CI = [0.9, 6.9], p = .07), although this finding was marginally significant.

In the present study, to understand the intracellular mechanisms involved in increased solubility of the target recombinant protein through EnBase system, the effect of this system was investigated on E. coli cells proteome profile. The proteome profile of E. coli cells cultured in EnBase and conventional batch mode was analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. The proteins with significant expressional changes were identified through MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometry. In EnBase system, the expressions of carbon metabolism-related proteins, sugar transport system-related proteins, and amino acids metabolism-related proteins were significantly altered. Furthermore, the expression of Thioredoxin 1 as the facilitator of protein folding was up-regulated in EnBase system that could be related to the increased solubility of recombinant protein. The proteomics analysis of E. coli cells cultured in EnBase system revealed that Thioredoxin 1 can be a potential candidate for future studies aiming at increased anti-VEGF fab fragment solubility. Studying proteomics is a valuable tool for revealing the target proteins that play the central role in EnBase culture system for increasing the solubility.",Physiological Regulation of Growth during Social Ascension in a Group-Living Fish.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735088,Physiological and biochemical zoology : PBZ,2019 03 20,"In social groups, dominant animals typically are larger and have better access to resources than subordinates. When subordinates are given the opportunity to ascend to a dominant position, they will elevate their rates of growth to help secure dominance. This study investigated the physiological mechanisms facilitating this increased growth. Using the group-living cichlid, Neolamprologus pulcher, we investigated whether the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) system-a key regulator of growth-is involved in the regulation of growth during social ascension. We also assessed differences in energy storage and expenditure among dominant, subordinate, and ascending males to determine the energetic costs associated with ascension. Daily growth rates tripled during ascension, and ascending males expended more energy after ascension, owing to higher rates of energetically costly social behaviors, increased locomotor activity, and larger home ranges. Ascenders did not increase food intake to offset increasing energetic costs but had half the liver glycogen energy stores of subordinates. Together, these results indicate a reliance on stockpiled energy reserves to fuel the high energetic demands associated with ascension. Transcript abundance of IGF binding proteins 1 (igfbp1) and 2a (igfbp2a) were low in ascenders relative to subordinates, suggesting a higher capacity for growth during ascension through increased bioavailability of circulating IGF-1. Our findings provide clear evidence of the energetic costs of social ascension and offer novel insight into the physiological mechanisms modulating the social regulation of growth.",Experiences with rotavirus vaccines: can we improve rotavirus vaccine impact in developing countries?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735087,Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics,2019 02 08,"Rotavirus vaccines have been introduced into over 95 countries globally and demonstrate substantial impact in reducing diarrheal mortality and diarrheal hospitalizations in young children. The vaccines are also considered by WHO as ""very cost effective"" interventions for young children, particularly in countries with high diarrheal disease burden. Yet the full potential impact of rotavirus immunization is yet to be realized. Large countries with big birth cohorts and where disease burden is high in Africa and Asia have not yet implemented rotavirus vaccines at all or at scale. Significant advances have been made demonstrating the impact of the vaccines in low- and lower-middle income countries, yet the modest effectiveness of the vaccines in these settings is challenging. Current research highlights these challenges and considers alternative strategies to overcome them, including alternative immunization schedules and host factors that may inform us of new opportunities.","Formation of the Inclusive Environments and Metrics in Biology Education and Research (iEMBER) Network: Building a Culture of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735086,CBE life sciences education,2019 05 10,"The Inclusive Environments and Metrics in Biology Education and Research (iEMBER) network is a newly forming national community of practice that engages diversity, equity, and inclusion stakeholders in interdisciplinary collaborative projects. iEMBER was initiated with incubator funding from the National Science Foundation program for Research Coordination Networks in Undergraduate Biology Education.

The admissions process has been the focus of examination, as it is a potential bottleneck for entry into STEM. Standardized tests are widely used as part of the decision-making process; thus, we examined the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) in two models of applicant review: metrics-based applicant review and holistic applicant review to understand whether it affected applicant demographics at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center UTHealth Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences. We measured the relationship between GRE scores of doctoral applicants and admissions committee scores. Metrics-based review of applicants excluded twice the number of applicants who identified as a historically underrepresented minority compared with their peers. Efforts to implement holistic applicant review resulted in an unexpected result: the GRE could be used as a tool in a manner that did not reflect its reported bias. Applicant assessments in our holistic review process were independent of gender, racial, and citizenship status. Importantly, our recommendations provide a blueprint for institutions that want to implement a data-driven approach to assess applicants in a manner that uses the GRE as part of the review process.","Differences in Substance Use Disparities Across Age Groups in a National Cross-Sectional Survey of Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual Adults.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735084,LGBT health,2019 03 29,"Lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) adults have elevated rates of substance use (SU) relative to heterosexual adults, yet the extent to which these disparities vary across age groups is unknown.

Background:
Klebsiella pneumoniae has gained notoriety because of its high antibiotic resistance and mortality. We compared the clinical features and outcomes of polymicrobial bacteremia involving K. pneumoniae (PBKP). 
Patients and Methods:
 A retrospective observational study of patients with polymicrobial and monomicrobial bacteremia involving K. pneumoniae from January 2012 to December 2016 was performed. The expression of resistance and virulence genes of 27 strains was also compared by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). 
Results:
 Among the polymicrobial group, the most common accompanying micro-organism was Escherichia coli. No differences in the expression of resistance and virulence genes was found among the 27 strains collected from the group. The analysis of the outcomes revealed that the patients with PBKP were more likely to have recurrent blood stream infections (p = 0.038), longer intensive care unit (ICU) lengths of stay (p = 0.043), and a higher total hospitalization cost (p = 0.045). However, no substantial differences in mortality were found between the two groups. The multivariable analysis revealed that a longer hospital stay prior to the onset of bacteremia (>20 days) was an independent risk factor for PBKP (p = 0.034), and the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score upon onset of infection (p = 0.013), the adequacy of source control (p < 0.001), and iron supplementation (p = 0.003) were identified as independent predictors of mortality in patients with KP bacteremia. 
Conclusions:
 The development of septic shock and the concomitant use of iron supplementation are associated with higher mortality in patients with KP bacteremia, and PBKP did not increase the mortality of these patients, possibly because of the ability of K. pneumoniae to obscure the effects of other bacteria. Thus, adequate source control is more important than high-dose antibiotic therapy and is linked to higher survival.",Cardiovascular Effect of Diosgenin in Ovariectomized Rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735081,Journal of medicinal food,2019 03 19,"Diosgenin is a phytoestrogen and a constituent of Dioscorea. It has several biological effects, and some of them are anti-inflammatory, antidiabetic, antitumor, and vasodilatory. The present study investigated both the vasorelaxing and antioxidant mechanisms of diosgenin in isolated rat aortic rings. Female rats weighing 200-220 g were subjected to sham or OVX operations at 8 weeks of age. Ovariectomy was performed for menopause induction after anesthesia. Diosgenin (10-9 M-3 × 10-4 M) produced a concentration-dependent relaxation in aortic rings precontracted with phenylephrine (1 μM), exhibiting Emax value of 55.34% ± 7.7% (in endothelium-intact rings) and Emax value of 30.30% ± 5.7% (in endothelium-denuded rings). In the endothelium-intact rings, the vasorelaxing effect of diosgenin was reduced by NG-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) (100 μM), atropine (1 μM), indomethacin (10 μM), 1H-[1,2,4]oxadiazolo-[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ) (10 μM), 4-aminopyridine (1 mM), tetraethylammonium (3 mM), glibenclamide (10 μM), apamin (10 μM), and Tiron (1 μM). Diosgenin (10-5 M) inhibited the contractions induced by cumulative addition of phenylephrine (10-9-10-5 M). The 28-days treatment with diosgenin (50 mg/kg, v.o.) did not imply changes in the myeloperoxidase parameter, but increased significantly, levels of glutathione, superoxide dismutase, and nitric oxide, as well as reduced the concentration of malondialdehyde related to lipid peroxidation. Our results suggest that diosgenin induced relaxation in aortic rings via an endothelium-dependent pathway, which involves the EDRF, the opening of potassium channels and antioxidant action.",Development of a Novel Tool to Assess Intimate Partner Violence Against Transgender Individuals.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735080,Journal of interpersonal violence,2019 05 15,"Intimate partner violence (IPV) takes on unique dimensions when directed against transgender individuals, with perpetrators leveraging transphobia to assert power and control. Standard IPV measurement tools do not assess this type of IPV. Four questions to assess transgender-related IPV (T-IPV) were developed: (a) being forced to conform to an undesired gender presentation or to stop pursuing gender transition; (b) being pressured to remain in a relationship by being told no one would date a transgender person; (c) being ""outed"" as a form of blackmail; and (d) having transition-related hormones, prosthetics, or clothing hidden or destroyed. The T-IPV tool was administered to 150 female-to-male transmasculine individuals completing a study of cervical cancer screening in Boston from March 2015-September 2016. Construct validity was assessed by examining correlations between T-IPV and two validated screeners of other forms of IPV (convergent) and employment status and fruit consumption (divergent). The association between T-IPV and negative health outcomes (posttraumatic stress disorder [PTSD], depression, psychological symptoms, binge drinking, number of sexual partners, and sexually transmitted infection [STI] diagnosis) were also calculated. Lifetime T-IPV was reported by 38.9%, and 10.1% reported past-year T-IPV. T-IPV was more prevalent among those who reported lifetime physical (51.7% vs. 31.7%, p = .01) and sexual (58.7% vs. 19.4%, p < .001) IPV than those who did not. Lifetime T-IPV was associated with PTSD (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 2.23, 95% confidence interval [CI] = [1.04, 4.80]), depression (AOR = 2.70, 95% CI = [1.22, 5.96]), and psychological distress (AOR = 2.82, 95% CI = [1.10, 7.26]). The T-IPV assessment tool demonstrated adequate reliability and validity and measures a novel type of abuse that is prevalent and associated with significant mental health burden. Future work should further validate the measure and pilot it with male-to-female transfeminine individuals."

The invasive listeriosis annual incidence rate per 100,000 for 2008-2016 was 0.28 cases among the general population (excluding pregnant females), and 3.73 cases among pregnant females. For adults ≥70 years, the annual incidence rate per 100,000 was 1.33 cases. No significant change in estimated listeriosis incidence was found over the 2008-2016 period, except for a small, but significantly lower pregnancy-associated rate in 2011-2013 when compared with 2008-2010. Among the nonpregnancy-associated cases, RRs increased with age from 0.43 (95% confidence interval: 0.25-0.73) for 0- to 14-year olds to 44.9 (33.5-60.0) for ≥85-year olds, compared with 15- to 44-year olds. Males had an incidence of 1.28 (1.12-1.45) times that of females. Compared with non-Hispanic whites, the incidence was 1.57 (1.18-1.20) times higher among non-Hispanic Asians, 1.49 (1.22-1.83) among non-Hispanic blacks, and 1.73 (1.15-2.62) among Hispanics.

This systematic review aimed to synthesize the knowledge about the effect of dietary interventions on patient-reported outcomes (PRO) and inflammation in patients with FM. Six electronic databases - PubMed, BioMed Central, Cochrane library, EMBASE, LILACS and ISI - were searched for clinical trials, in which a dietary intervention in patients with FM diagnosed was conducted. Quality of evidence assessment was measured in accordance with GRADE methodology. Seven clinical trials - 3 randomized controlled trials, 1 unrandomized clinical trial and 3 uncontrolled clinical trials were identified. Dietary approaches included gluten-free diet (n = 1), raw vegetarian diet (n = 2), low Fermentable oligo-, di- and monossacharides, alcohols and polyols (FODMAPs) diet (n = 1), hypocaloric diet (n = 2) and monosodium glutamate- and aspartame-free diet interventions (n = 1).

Karst). Eight compounds with flavor dilution factors ≥16 were quantitated in a 16-day sample using stable isotope dilution assays. Odor activity values (OAV) revealed anise-smelling 4-methoxybenzaldehyde (OAV; 1639), vanilla-smelling 3,4-dimethoxybenzaldehyde (OAV; 51), and cherry-smelling benzaldehyde (OAV; 14) as key contributors to the pleasant ""candy-like"" odor of the fermentation broth. Odor simulation experiments revealed a mixture of five compounds in their natural concentrations mimicked the odor of a 16-day-old fermentation broth. A 30-day time course study was conducted to monitor the production of three odorants in the fungal fermentation broth, where it was revealed that both 3,4-dimethoxybenzaldehyde (10.7 ± 1.0 mg/kg) and benzaldehyde (4.5 ± 0.1 mg/kg) peaked on day 16, whereas 4-methoxybenzaldehyde peaked on day 24 (104.9 ± 4.9 mg/kg).",Nanoparticle-Peptide-Drug Bioconjugates for Unassisted Defeat of Multidrug Resistance in a Model Cancer Cell Line.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735042,Bioconjugate chemistry,2019 03 20,"Multidrug resistance (MDR) is a significant challenge in the treatment of many types of cancers as membrane-associated transporters actively pump drugs out of the cell, limiting therapeutic efficacy. While nanoparticle (NP)-based therapeutics have emerged as a mechanism for overcoming MDR, they often rely on the delivery of multiple anticancer drugs, nucleic acid hybrids, or MDR pump inhibitors. The effectiveness of these strategies, however, can be limited by their off-target toxicity or the need for genetic transfection. In this paper, we describe a NP-peptide-drug bioconjugate that achieves significant cell killing in MDR-positive cancer cells without the need for additional drugs. We use a quantum dot (QD) as a central scaffold to append two species of peptide, a cell-uptake peptide to facilitate endocytic internalization and a peptide-drug conjugate that is susceptible to cleavage by esterases found within the endocytic pathway. This approach relies on spatiotemporal control over drug release, where endosomes traffic drug away from membrane-resident pumps and release it closer to the nucleus. Cellular internalization studies showed high uptake of the NP-drug complex and nuclear localization of the drug after 48 h in MDR-positive cells. Additionally, cellular proliferation assays demonstrated a 40% decrease in cell viability for the NP-drug bioconjugate compared to free drug, confirming the utility of this system in overcoming MDR in cancer cells.","Cryptic and Stereospecific Hydroxylation, Oxidation, and Reduction in Platensimycin and Platencin Biosynthesis.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735041,Journal of the American Chemical Society,2019 06 10,"Platensimycin (PTM) and platencin (PTN) are highly functionalized bacterial diterpenoids of ent-kauranol and ent-atiserene biosynthetic origin. C7 oxidation in the B-ring plays a key biosynthetic role in generating structural complexity known for ent-kaurane and ent-atisane derived diterpenoids. While all three oxidation patterns, α-hydroxyl, β-hydroxyl, and ketone, at C7 are seen in both the ent-kaurane and ent-atisane derived diterpenoids, their biosynthetic origins remain largely unknown. We previously established that PTM and PTN are produced by a single biosynthetic machinery, featuring cryptic C7 oxidations at the B-rings that transform the ent-kauranol and ent-atiserene derived precursors into the characteristic PTM and PTN scaffolds. Here, we report a three-enzyme cascade affording C7 α-hydroxylation in PTM and PTN biosynthesis. Combining in vitro and in vivo studies, we show that PtmO3 and PtmO6 are two functionally redundant α-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases that generate a cryptic C7 β-hydroxyl on each of the ent-kauranol and ent-atiserene scaffolds, and PtmO8 and PtmO1, a pair of NAD+/NADPH-dependent dehydrogenases, subsequently work in concert to invert the C7 β-hydroxyl to α-hydroxyl via a C7 ketone intermediate. PtmO3 and PtmO6 represent the first dedicated C7 β-hydroxylases characterized to date and, together with PtmO8 and PtmO1, provide an account for the biosynthetic origins of all three C7 oxidation patterns that may shed light on other B-ring modifications in bacterial, plant, and fungal diterpenoid biosynthesis. Given their unprecedented activities in C7 oxidations, PtmO3, PtmO6, PtmO8, and PtmO1 enrich the growing toolbox of novel enzymes that could be exploited as biocatalysts to rapidly access complex diterpenoid natural products.",Influence of the Counterion on the Synthesis of Cyclic Carbonates Catalyzed by Bifunctional Aluminum Complexes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735040,Inorganic chemistry,2019 03 08,"New bifunctional aluminum complexes have been prepared with the aim of studying the effect of a counterion on the synthesis of cyclic carbonates from epoxides and carbon dioxide (CO2). Neutral ligand 1 was used as a precursor to obtain four novel mesylate, chloride, bromide, and iodide zwitterionic NNO ligands (2-5). The reaction of these ligands with 1 or 2 equiv of AlR3 (R = Me, Et) allowed the synthesis of mono- and bimetallic bifunctional aluminum complexes [AlR2(κ2-mbpzappe)]X [X = Cl, R = Me (6), Et (7); X = Br, R = Me (8), Et (9); X = I, R = Me (10), Et (11)] and [{AlR2(κ2-mbpzappe)}(μ-O){AlR3}]X [X = MeSO3, R = Me (12), Et (13); X = Cl, R = Me (14), Et (15); X = Br, R = Me (16), Et (17); X = I, R = Me (18), Et (19)] via alkane elimination. These complexes were studied as catalysts for the synthesis of cyclic carbonates from epoxides and CO2. Iodide complex 11 showed to be the most active catalyst for terminal epoxides, whereas bromide complex 9 was found to be the optimal catalyst when internal epoxides were used, showing the importance of the nucleophile cocatalyst on the catalytic activity.",Induction of Enzyme-like Peroxidase Activity in an Iron Porphyrin Complex Using Second Sphere Interactions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735039,Inorganic chemistry,2019 03 14,"Emulating enzymatic reactivity using small molecules has been a long-time challenging pursuit of the scientific community. Peroxidases, ubiquitous heme enzymes that are involved in hormone synthesis and the immune system, have been a prime target of such efforts due to their tremendous potential in the chemical industry as well as in wastewater treatment. Here it is demonstrated that inclusion of a second sphere guanidine moiety in an iron porphyrin not only makes this small molecule a veritable peroxidase catalyst but also offers an auxiliary binding site for organic substrates, facilitating their rapid oxidation with a green oxidant like H2O2. This small molecule analogue exhibits a ""ping-pong"" mechanism and Michaelis-Menten type kinetics, which is generally typical of metallo-enzymes and follows a mechanism of the natural enzyme in its entirety, including the formation of compound I as the primary oxidant.",A Chemically Disrupted Proximity System for Controlling Dynamic Cellular Processes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735038,Journal of the American Chemical Society,2019 05 02,"Chemical methods that allow the spatial proximity of proteins to be temporally modulated are powerful tools for studying biology and engineering synthetic cellular behaviors. Here, we describe a new chemically controlled method for rapidly disrupting the interaction between two basally colocalized protein binding partners. Our chemically disrupted proximity (CDP) system is based on the interaction between the hepatitis C virus protease (HCVp) NS3a and a genetically encoded peptide inhibitor. Using clinically approved antiviral inhibitors as chemical disrupters of the NS3a/peptide interaction, we demonstrate that our CDP system can be used to confer temporal control over diverse intracellular processes. This NS3a-based CDP system represents a new modality for engineering chemical control over intracellular protein function that is complementary to currently available techniques.",Native Nano-electrospray Differential Mobility Analyzer (nES GEMMA) Enables Size Selection of Liposomal Nanocarriers Combined with Subsequent Direct Spectroscopic Analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735037,Analytical chemistry,2019 03 29,"Gas-phase electrophoresis employing a nano-electrospray differential mobility analyzer (nES DMA), aka gas-phase electrophoretic mobility molecular analyzer (nES GEMMA), enables nanoparticle separation in the gas-phase according to their surface-dry diameter with number-based concentration detection. Moreover, particles in the nanometer size range can be collected after size selection on supporting materials. It has been shown by subsequent analyses employing orthogonal methods, for instance, microscopic or antibody-based techniques, that the surface integrity of collected analytes remains intact. Additionally, native nES GEMMA demonstrated its applicability for liposome characterization. Liposomes are nanometer-sized, biodegradable, and rather labile carriers (nanoobjects) consisting of a lipid bilayer encapsulating an aqueous lumen. In nutritional and pharmaceutical applications, these vesicles allow shielded, targeted transport and sustained release of bioactive cargo material. To date, cargo quantification is based on bulk measurements after bilayer rupture. In this context, we now compare capillary electrophoresis and spectroscopic characterization of vesicles in solution (bulk measurements) to the possibility of spectroscopic investigation of individual, size-separated/collected liposomes after nES GEMMA. Surface-dried, size-selected vesicles were collected intact on calcium fluoride (CaF2) substrates and zinc selenide (ZnSe) prisms, respectively, for subsequent spectroscopic investigation. Our proof-of-principle study demonstrates that the off-line hyphenation of gas-phase electrophoresis and confocal Raman spectroscopy allows detection of isolated, nanometer-sized soft material/objects. Additionally, atomic force microscopy-infrared spectroscopy (AFM-IR) as an advanced spectroscopic system was employed to access molecule-specific information with nanoscale lateral resolution. The off-line hyphenation of nES GEMMA and AFM-IR is introduced to enable chemical imaging of single, i.e., individual, liposome particles.",Full-Length Transcriptome Analysis of the Genes Involved in Tocopherol Biosynthesis in Torreya grandis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735036,Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,2019 03 04,"The seeds of Torreya grandis (Cephalotaxaceae) are rich in tocopherols, which are essential components of the human diet as a result of their function in scavenging reactive oxygen and free radicals. Different T. grandis cultivars (10 cultivars selected in this study were researched, and their information is shown in Table S1 of the Supporting Information) vary enormously in their tocopherol contents (0.28-11.98 mg/100 g). However, little is known about the molecular basis and regulatory mechanisms of tocopherol biosynthesis in T. grandis kernels. Here, we applied single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing to T. grandis (X08 cultivar) for the first time and obtained a total of 97 211 full-length transcripts. We proposed the biosynthetic pathway of tocopherol and identified eight full-length transcripts encoding enzymes potentially involved in tocopherol biosynthesis in T. grandis. The results of the correlation analysis between the tocopherol content and gene expression level in the 10 selected cultivars and different kernel developmental stages of the X08 cultivar suggested that homogentisate phytyltransferase coding gene ( TgVTE2b) and γ-tocopherol methyltransferase coding gene ( TgVTE4) may be key players in tocopherol accumulation in the kernels of T. grandis. Subcellular localization assays showed that both TgVTE2b and TgVTE4 were localized to the chloroplast. We also identified candidate regulatory genes similar to WRI1 and DGAT1 in Arabidopsis that may be involved in the regulation of tocopherol biosynthesis. Our findings provide valuable genetic information for T. grandis using full-length transcriptomic analysis, elucidating the candidate genes and key regulatory genes involved in tocopherol biosynthesis. This information will be critical for further molecular-assisted screening and breeding of T. grandis genotypes with high tocopherol contents.",Programmable DNA Ring/Hairpin-Constrained Structure Enables Ligation-Free Rolling Circle Amplification for Imaging mRNAs in Single Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735035,Analytical chemistry,2019 03 05,"Self-assembled functional DNA structures have proven to be excellent materials for designing and implementing a variety of nanoscale devices. We demonstrate here that a rationally designed and programmable DNA ring/hairpin-constrained structure can achieve in situ ligation-free rolling circle amplification (RCA), which further leads to highly specific, sensitive, and multicolor imaging of mRNA molecules in single cells. Such a structure aims at addressing current challenges in terms of simplicity, sensitivity, and multiplexing capability related to the detection and imaging of intracellular mRNA sequences. With this new DNA ring/hairpin-RCA approach, we are able to detect the target mRNAs with high sensitivity at the subpicomolar levels in vitro. Besides, the multiplexing capability of the DNA structures can be readily realized by barcoding the DNA rings and hairpins with distinct sequences. Due to the excellent sequence recognition ability of the hairpins, the DNA structures exhibit single-base variation discrimination capability for the target mRNA and can be used to image trace amounts of down-expressed mRNAs in single cells. Moreover, drug-dependent mRNA expression variations can also be clearly differentiated by these DNA structures, highlighting the great potential of such structures for early disease diagnosis and for screening possible therapeutic drugs.",Functional Expression and Characterization of Human Myristoylated-Arf1 in Nanodisc Membrane Mimetics.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735034,Biochemistry,2019 03 12,"Lipidated small GTP-binding proteins of the Arf family interact with multiple cellular partners and with membranes to regulate intracellular traffic and organelle structure. Here, we focus on the ADP-ribosylation factor 1 (Arf1), which interacts with numerous proteins in the Arf pathway, such as the ArfGAP ASAP1 that is highly expressed and activated in several cancer cell lines and associated with enhanced migration, invasiveness, and poor prognosis. Understanding the molecular and mechanistic details of Arf1 regulation at the membrane via structural and biophysical studies requires large quantities of fully functional protein bound to lipid bilayers. Here, we report on the production of a functional human Arf1 membrane platform on nanodiscs for biophysical studies. Large scale bacterial production of highly pure, N-myristoylated human Arf1 has been achieved, including complex isotopic labeling for nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies, and the myr-Arf1 can be readily assembled in small nanoscale lipid bilayers (nanodiscs, NDs). It is determined that myr-Arf1 requires a minimum binding surface in the NDs of ∼20 lipids. Fluorescence and NMR were used to establish nucleotide exchange and ArfGAP-stimulated GTP hydrolysis at the membrane, indicating that phophoinositide stimulation of the activity of the ArfGAP ASAP1 is ≥2000-fold. Differences in nonhydrolyzable GTP analogues are observed, and GMPPCP is found to be the most stable. Combined, these observations establish a functional environment for biophysical studies of Arf1 effectors and interactions at the membrane."

Identifying the best intervention when several options are available constitute a great challenge for every clinician. Traditional meta-analysis (TMA) allows summarizing evidence from studies that compare the same two interventions for one event (head to head studies or direct comparisons). Network meta-analysis (NMA) is a relatively new procedure that allows to compare multiple interventions for one event, even when non-head to head studies have been conducted (indirect evidence). Other advantages of NMA include increasing the accuracy of the results and ranking all the interventions according to their effectiveness. These features are of paramount importance as: 1) they summarize information from events (e.g. diseases or outcomes) that has more than two possible interventions (e.g. treatments or procedures); 2) they strengthen the level of guideline recommendations; and 3) they identify new hypotheses based on indirect comparison. As this is a narrative review, all manuscripts have been selected from PubMed according to our best knowledge with the aim to illustrate different features, options or applications of NMA in critical care. First, we provide a description of the usefulness, interpretation, assumptions and main plots related to NMAs. Second, we analyzed some examples of NMAs related to critical care medicine. Third, we include a pragmatic approach about how results from NMAs can improve the clinical practice as well an R script with a database to conduct an NMAs and reproduce figures and tables that have been shown here. As a conclusion, NMA is an established, robust, objective and reproducible statistic technique that has been applied to several critical care areas. Clinical practice guidelines have started to include NMA evidence to support their recommendations. In future years, it seems highly probable that this technique will increase it applicability in almost all areas of critical care medicine.",Extracorporeal blood purification techniques in children with hyper-inflammatory syndromes: a clinical overview.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735018,Minerva anestesiologica,2019 04 24,"Data on clinical applications of blood purification techniques in children are scarce. The aim of this review is to offer a clinical overview, as complete as possible, on blood purification in children with hyper-inflammatory syndromes (HS). A review of the literature using the PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Scopus databases, on the most recent data about blood purification in children was conducted until June 2018. Except for three randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on plasma exchange, no RCTs, but only observational studies or case reports were found regarding other blood purification techniques in children. High-volume hemofiltration in two non-randomized trials did not significantly reduce 28-day mortality in children. PE was not associated with reduced mortality in pediatric patients with septic shock, but the small number of patients enrolled is an important limitation. The use of polymixin B and other adsorbing columns in children with septic shock and HS is increasing, but results are still limited by the observational nature of the studies. Based on the low-level of available evidence, no conclusions can be drawn regarding the efficacy and safety of blood purification in children. Further research with more clinically robust data is needed to determine the impact of different extracorporeal blood purification techniques in this pediatric population.",Intraoperative monitoring of nociception for opioid administration: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735017,Minerva anestesiologica,2019 04 24,"Under-dosage or over-dosage of intraoperative analgesia can cause harm to patients.

In this review, we set out to provide several examples of injuries, to elucidate the precise anatomy of fractured bones (osteotomes), and to elaborate on certain peripheral nerve blocks employed in pain management of trauma patients. Controversies/special considerations pertaining to peripheral nerve blocks also dictate thorough analysis: as such, acute compartment syndrome, acute peripheral nerve injuries, regional anesthesia in awake or anesthetized patients, continuous peripheral nerve blocks, positioning limitations and, finally, ultrasound imaging versus neurostimulation techniques, are extensively reviewed.",Proportional Assist Ventilation feasibility in the early stage of respiratory failure: a prospective randomized multicenter trial.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735015,Minerva anestesiologica,2019 02 08,Proportional assist ventilation (PAV+) is an assisted ventilator mode usually applied during weaning.

Studies have shown that mutations in melatonin receptor 1A (MTNR1A) gene are related to litter size as well as the ovulation rate in sheep and goats. In this study, polymorphism of two loci in MTNR1A melatonin receptor gene was studied in order to survey their relationship with litter size in Markhoz goats. PCR primers were employed to mask polymorphisms of MTNR1A in 150 does by PCR-RFLP method. After DNA extraction, the PCR-RFLP was performed using Ecol31I and HpaI restriction enzymes. Results showed that these loci were not polymorphic. These results show that the fecundity of Markhoz goats is not linked to MTNR1A. No polymorphism in MTNR1A was found in Markhoz goats, therefore, it is essential to test polymorphism of other genes or loci to facilitate marker-assisted selection techniques to improve reproduction traits in Markhoz goats.",Craniofacial morphology and soft tissue profile outcomes for complete unilateral and complete bilateral cleft lip and palate in New Zealand.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735011,Orthodontics & craniofacial research,2019 03 04,"(a) To establish baseline lateral craniofacial morphology and soft tissue profile outcomes for New Zealand children with complete unilateral and complete bilateral cleft lip and palate (CUCLP/CBCLP) and determine differences in relation to demographic characteristics including cleft type, sex and ethnicity and (b) To compare these outcomes to similar international studies.","The discovery and characterization of K-563, a novel inhibitor of the Keap1/Nrf2 pathway produced by Streptomyces sp.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735010,Cancer medicine,2019 04 09,"Keap1/Nrf2 pathway regulates the antioxidant stress response, detoxification response, and energy metabolism. Previous reports found that aberrant Keap1/Nrf2 pathway activation due to Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) mutations or Nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) mutations induced resistance of cancer cells to chemotherapy and accelerated cell growth via the supply of nutrients. Therefore, Keap1/Nrf2 pathway activation is associated with a poor prognosis in many cancers. These previous findings suggested that inhibition of Keap1/Nrf2 pathway could be a target for anti-cancer therapies. To discover a small-molecule Keap1/Nrf2 pathway inhibitor, we conducted high-throughput screening in Keap1 mutant human lung cancer A549 cells using a transcriptional reporter assay. Through this screening, we identified the novel Keap1/Nrf2 pathway inhibitor K-563, which was isolated from actinomycete Streptomyces sp. K-563 suppressed the expression of Keap1/Nrf2 pathway downstream target genes or the downstream target protein, which induced suppression of GSH production, and activated reactive oxygen species production in A549 cells. K-563 also inhibited the expression of downstream target genes in other Keap1- or Nrf2-mutated cancer cells. Furthermore, K-563 exerted anti-proliferative activities in these mutated cancer cells. These in vitro analyses showed that K-563 was able to inhibit cell growth in Keap1- or Nrf2-mutated cancer cells by Keap1/Nrf2 pathway inhibition. K-563 also exerted synergistic combinational effects with lung cancer chemotherapeutic agents. An in vivo study in mice xenotransplanted with A549 cells to further explore the therapeutic potential of K-563 revealed that it also inhibited Keap1/Nrf2 pathway in lung cancer tumors. K-563, a novel Keap1/Nrf2 pathway inhibitor, may be a lead compound for development as an anti-cancer agent.",Prognostic significance of mast cell and microvascular densities in malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor with and without neurofibromatosis type 1.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735009,Cancer medicine,2019 04 09,"Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are rare and aggressive soft tissue sarcomas with a significant susceptibility to metastasize early in their course. Pathogenesis is yet to be fully elucidated. Recently, the essential role of mast cells in the tumor onset of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1)-associated neurofibromas and MPNSTs was confirmed in both experimental and human studies. In this study, we investigate mast cell density (MCD), microvascular density (MVD), and proliferation index (Ki-67) in MPNST. A secondary aim was to correlate histological staining to clinical data and survival in patients with and without NF1. In total, 34 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded MPNST tissues from 29 patients were eligible. MCD, MVD, and Ki-67 labeling index (LI) were analyzed in all stained tissues by a computer-based quantitative algorithm (Aperio ImageScope). In addition, chart review was performed for clinical data and survival analysis. Overall, MCD, MVD, and Ki-67 LI were evenly distributed throughout tumor tissue. There was a negative correlation of NF1 status (affected, P = 0.037), tumor size (>10 cm, P = 0.023), and MVD in the tumor periphery (higher tercile, P = 0.002) to survival. Multivariate analysis confirmed the association of MVD in the tumor periphery (higher tercile, P = 0.019) with a decreased overall survival. Diverse mast cell and microvascular distributions suggest that angiogenesis in MPNST occurs independently. The role of mast cells in tumor progression is unclear and lacks prognostic value. Higher MVD has prognostic significance with possible therapeutic implications in MPNST."

Chem. Int. Ed. 57, 8859-8864 (2018)]. In order to dig into the nature of this novel bond the newly developed multi-component quantum theory of atoms in molecules (MC-QTAIM) is applied to this positronic system. The topological analysis reveals that this species is composed of two atoms in molecules, each containing a proton and half of the electronic and the positronic populations. Further analysis elucidates that the electron exchange phenomenon is virtually non-existent between the two atoms and no electronic covalent bond is conceivable in between. On the other hand, it is demonstrated that the positron density enclosed in each atom is capable of stabilizing interactions with the electron density of the neighboring atom. This electrostatic interaction suffices to make the whole system bonded against all dissociation channels. Thus, the positron indeed acts like an anti-matter glue between the two atoms.",Overestimation of health urgency as a cause for emergency services inappropriate use: Insights from an exploratory economics experiment in Portugal.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30734991,Health & social care in the community,2019 02 08,"Increasing visits to emergency departments add strain to public healthcare systems. The misperception of symptoms' severity can partly explain inappropriate use of hospitals' emergency departments by non-urgent patients. This paper focuses on the misperception of symptoms' severity as a cause for the inappropriate use of emergency departments. It explores the role that informing potential patients of the correct severity level can play in correcting this inefficiency. We implement in an incentivised manner an exploratory economic experiment to elicit the degree of severity of five sets of symptoms, corresponding to frequent causes of emergency department visits. The study was setup in Braga, Northern Portugal, recruiting voluntary participants through civic local organisations. We ask participants to indicate the more suitable health service, before and after revealing the true degree of severity. Results show that there is an overestimation of the degree of severity of some clinical profiles, and when confronted with the real severity, in only half of the cases are choices changed to other health services. Although exploratory, this study provides insights into the potential role of health education policies concerning symptoms' severity but it also highlights the limits of such policies. Furthermore, the use of economic experiments can provide meaningful insights for the design of policies addressing demand-side healthcare inefficiencies.",Aquablation for benign prostatic hyperplasia in large prostates (80-150 mL): 6-month results from the WATER II trial.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30734990,BJU international,2019 03 29,To present 6-month safety and effectiveness data from a multicentre prospective study of aquablation in men with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) attributable to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) with prostate volumes between 80 and 150 mL.,Effects of exercise training on multiple sclerosis biomarkers of central nervous system and disease status: a systematic review of intervention studies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30734989,European journal of neurology,2019 04 13,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a demyelinating and neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system (CNS) that can be tracked through biomarkers of disease status.

Then we review the current literature from both human and animal studies concerning altered basal ganglia function in five common psychiatric disorders: obsessive-compulsive disorder, substance-related and addiction disorders, major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and schizophrenia. Finally, we present a model based upon the findings of these studies that highlights the striatum as a particularly attractive target for restoring normal function to basal ganglia neurocircuits altered within psychiatric disorder patients."

Establishment of affordable and accessible water quality monitoring services may ensure acceptable levels of all the parameters. This paper aims to explore (a) health risk because of chemical contaminants of private wells, (b) population perspective on well water quality and monitoring, and (c) to create a business model of a centralized water quality monitoring service. The results show potential problems with toxic levels of arsenic, barium, cadmium, chromium, lead, mercury, and selenium. About 5% of the province's population is at risk for potential exposure to contaminated private well water. The survey reinforces that the successful implementation of water testing laboratories for private wells is a shared responsibility between well owners and the government organizations, and almost three-fourths respondents were willing to share the cost up to certain limit. A business model including financial projections for a centralized water testing laboratory is presented. Drinking of unmonitored private well water is putting population health at risk.

Based mainly on an analysis of in-depth interviews with family members who submitted a request for PR, we examine the regimes of justification used by supporters and opponents of this technology. With both sides using the notion of ""nature"" to support their claim, the dispute centers on whether PR constructs a new social expression of grief (and hence should be seen as unnatural) or is only a reflection of an age-old grieving process (and is thus natural). We argue that by employing a twofold, novel/traditional justification, PR supporters aim to go one step further, from a symbolic continuity of the dead to a so-called real one. This progression highlights the flexibility of the natural category at the intersection of technology and culture and the abandonment of such binary distinctions as life/death and nature/culture.",Farrerol attenuates MPP+ -induced inflammatory response by TLR4 signaling in a microglia cell line.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30734970,Phytotherapy research : PTR,2019 04 22,"Farrerol was found to possess neuroprotective effect; however, the mechanism remains unknown. The aim of the present study was to explore the effect of farrerol on MPP+ -induced inflammation in mouse microglial BV-2 cells and to elaborate the underlying mechanism. MTT assay was performed to measure the cell viability. The pro-inflammatory mediators and cytokines including interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1β, and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α); inducible nitric oxide synthase; and cyclooxygenase 2 were measured. The expression of p-p65, p-IκBα, toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), and myeloid differentiation primary response 88 were analyzed by western blot. We found that farrerol treatment improved cell viability in MPP+ -induced BV-2 cells. MPP+ -induced upregulation of IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α was inhibited by farrerol treatment. Farrerol treatment also attenuated MPP+ -induced expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase 2 as well as the activation of NF-κB in BV-2 cells. MPP+ -induced TLR4 signaling was markedly diminished by farrerol treatment. Knockdown of TLR4 attenuated MPP+ -induced inflammatory response in BV-2 cells. In conclusion, farrerol treatment attenuated MPP+ -induced inflammatory response by inhibiting the TLR4 signaling pathway in BV-2 cells. The results indicated that farrerol could be used as a therapeutic agent for preventing or alleviating the neuroinflammation-related diseases, such as Parkinson's disease.",Promising potentials of Tibetan macaques in xenotransplantation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30734969,Xenotransplantation,2019 05 28,"Organ transplantation is a crucial medical procedure, as it is often the only treatment for patients suffering from end-stage organ failure. Unfortunately, the shortage of donor organs limits the number of patients whose lives can be saved. Carrying out research on xenotransplantation with the aim of eventually replacing human organ transplants with those of animals is very promising, as it could effectively bridge the shortfall in donor organs. Thanks to the success of cloned pigs and to the emergence of gene-editing techniques, genetically modified pigs have come to be considered ideal animal donors for human xenotransplantation and have been widely used in basic research. Such research focuses on pig-to-nonhuman primates transplantation, as the recipients are suitable for preclinical studies because both their genes and organ sizes are similar to those of humans. Chinese transplantation scientists have carried out several experiments on Tibetan macaques, including successful preclinical transplants of material from genetically modified pigs, as well as research on such topics as intraocular pressure, Parkinson's disease, advanced cancer, islet transplantation, and liver transplantation. This article reviews basic and applied research on Tibetan macaques in xenotransplantation, as well as the issues of immune rejection and ethical concerns. We aim to demonstrate the various advantages of Tibetan macaques as transplant recipients compared to other nonhuman primate species and to provide a perspective for the future establishment of Tibetan macaques as principal recipients in preclinical studies of xenotransplantation.","Social adaptation and adaptation pressure among the ""drifting elderly"" in China: A qualitative study in Shanghai.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30734968,The International journal of health planning and management,2019 02 08,"In China, a population of ""drifting elderly"" that is mainly composed of older parents who migrate for nonemployment reasons has emerged and developed rapidly.

Typically, these targets are presented as percentiles of patients to be seen within specified timeframes. These targets present hospital administrators with a resourcing problem complicated by conflicting objectives: How to minimize costs while maximizing throughput to achieve the performance targets? In this paper, we describe the use of a simulation model to evaluate the effect of changes to staff levels in a cytology department, investigating the trade-off between staff levels and turnaround times in light of performance targets specified by government. Standard practice for determining staffing levels in a cytology department uses average workload estimates and does not take into account target performance measures, task variability, and the interruptive nature of the workload of pathologists. We develop a simulation model for pathologist workload within a cytology department in New Zealand. We describe the model construction process that follows the hierarchical control conceptual modeling (HCCM) framework. We use the resulting simulation model to examine the trade-offs between staffing levels (and associated rosters) and task turnaround time. The results indicate that consideration of variation in task arrivals is important when considering the effect of staffing levels on turnaround time. Furthermore, as the cytology department is required to meet performance targets that involve maximum service times for a percentile of patients, such an approach is necessary in order to estimate the performance level of a staffing roster.","Rhodium-Catalyzed Copper-Assisted Intermolecular Domino C-H Annulation of 1,3-Diynes with Picolinamides: Access to Pentacyclic π-Extended Systems.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30734965,"Chemistry (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)",2019 04 19,"A new mode of reactivity of 1,3-diynes in rhodium-catalyzed oxidative annulation reactions has enabled the rapid assembly of extended π systems from readily available picolinamide derivatives. The process involves a double C-H bond activation and the iterative annulation of two 1,3-diyne units, with each alkyne moiety engaged in an orchestrated insertion sequence with high regiocontrol, leading to the formation of five new C-C bonds and the construction of four fused rings in a single operation. Either isoquinoline-1-carboxamides or fused polycyclic systems can be accessed by a switch in the regioselectivity of the second diyne insertion depending on the reaction conditions. DFT theoretical calculations have elucidated that the cooperative participation of both rhodium and copper in substrate activation, favored in the presence of excess of the copper(II) salt, is key to such a reversal of regioselectivity and subsequent multiple cyclization leading to fused polycyclic products. The role of copper was found to be essential in assisting both multiple insertion and rhodium-walking sequences, with the implication of intermediates with a Rh-Cu bond (2.60 Å).",Can urinary histoplasma antigen test improve the diagnosis of histoplasmosis in a tuberculosis endemic region?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30734964,Mycoses,2019 05 17,Many patients with histoplasmosis are treated with anti-tubercular therapy (ATT) in tuberculosis endemic regions as diagnosis of histoplasmosis requires invasive sampling.

Targeted MS holds the promise of a paradigm shift in the quantitative determination of proteins. Nevertheless, targeted quantitative proteomics requires improvisation in making sample processing, instruments, and data analysis more accessible. In the backdrop of the genomic era reaching its zenith, certain questions arise: is the proteomic era about to come? If we are at the beginning of a new future for protein quantification, are we prepared to incorporate targeted proteomics at the benchside for basic research and at the bedside for the good of patients? Here, an overview of the knowledge required to perform targeted proteomics as well as its applications is provided. A special emphasis is placed on upcoming areas such as peptidomics, proteoform research, and mass spectrometry imaging, where the utilization of targeted proteomics is expected to bring forth new avenues.

These specimens extend the range of A. japonicus eastward into Oceania. We review the systematic characters of the monotypic genus Atrophacanthus and present colour photographs of freshly collected specimens. The diet of the juvenile specimens of A. japonicus consisted of thecosome pteropods and foraminiferans. We present a range map of A. japonicus based on all known specimens and show that specimen size is related to whether specimens were collected in the pelagic zone or on the bottom. Our results support that, compared to all other Triacanthodidae, A. japonicus has an unusually extended pelagic larval and juvenile period, up to 54 mm LS , before settling to the bottom as adults. Lastly, we provide a multilocus phylogeny addressing the phylogenetic placement of Atrophacanthus based on eight of 11 triacanthodid genera and six genetic markers.

The appearance of type 3 diabetes in the brain leads to the development of the sporadic form of Alzheimer's disease. The c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK), a subfamily of the Mitogen Activated Protein Kinases, are enzymes composed by three different isoforms with differential modulatory activity against the insulin receptor (IR) and its substrate. This research focused on understanding the regulatory role of JNK2 on the IR, as well as study the effect of a high-fat diet (HFD) in the brain. Our observations determined how JNK2 ablation did not induce compensatory responses in the expression of the other isoforms but led to an increase in JNKs total activity. HFD-fed animals also showed an increased activity profile of the JNKs. These animals also displayed endoplasmic reticulum stress and up-regulation of the protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) and the suppressor of cytokine signalling 3 protein. Consequently, a reduction in insulin sensitivity was detected and it is correlated with a decrease on the signalling of the IR. Moreover, cognitive impairment was observed in all groups but only wild-type genotype animals fed with HFD showed neuroinflammatory responses. In conclusion, HFD and JNK2 absence cause alterations in normal cognitive activity by altering the signalling of the IR. These affectations are related to the appearance of endoplasmic reticulum stress and an increase in the levels of inhibitory proteins like PTP1B and suppressor of cytokine signalling 3 protein.

We examined how P-sufficient 6-week-old soil-grown Trifolium subterraneum plants, and 2-week-old seedlings in solution culture, accumulated P in roots after inorganic P (Pi) addition. In contrast to our expectation that vacuoles would accumulate excess P, after 7 days, X-ray microanalysis showed that vacuolar [P] remained low (<12 mmol kg-1 ). However, in the plants after P addition, some cortex cells contained globular structures extraordinarily rich in P (often >3,000 mmol kg-1 ), potassium, magnesium, and sodium. Similar structures were evident in seedlings, both before and after P addition, with their [P] increasing threefold after P addition. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy showed seedling roots accumulated Pi following P addition, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed large plastids. For seedlings, we demonstrated that roots differentially expressed genes after P addition using RNAseq mapped to the T. subterraneum reference genome assembly and transcriptome profiles. Among the most up-regulated genes after 4 hr was TSub_g9430.t1, which is similar to plastid envelope Pi transporters (PHT4;1, PHT4;4): expression of vacuolar Pi-transporter homologs did not change.

From the evolution of echolocation, prehensile tail, viviparity, or winged flight, environmental factors often drive this astonishing phenomenon. However, convergent evolution is not always conspicuous or easily identified. Giant damselflies count among the largest flying insects on Earth, and have astonishing ecologies including orb-web spider plucking and oviposition in phytotelmata. One species occurs in the Afrotropics and 18 species are found in the Neotropics. Convergent evolution was historically hypothesized based on the ecological and morphological affinities of these two geographically distant lineages but was not supported by earlier phylogenetic inferences supporting their monophyly. Using a molecular supermatrix approach and a large selection of outgroups, we revisit and reject the monophyly of Afrotropical and Neotropical giant damselflies that is otherwise supported by a morphological phylogeny. Molecular divergence time estimation suggests an origin of Afrotropical giant damselflies in the late Paleogene, and of Neotropical ones at the Cretaceous/Paleogene boundary, thereby rejecting a long-standing West Gondwana vicariance hypothesis. The strong ecological and morphological resemblances between these two independent lineages represents an astonishing case of Amphi-Atlantic tropical convergent evolution.",N-homocysteinylation of tau and MAP1 is increased in autopsy specimens of Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30734924,The Journal of pathology,2019 03 19,"The pathomechanisms that associate a deficit in folate and/or vitamin B12 and the subsequent hyperhomocysteinemia with pathological brain ageing are unclear. We investigated the homocysteinylation of microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) in brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease or vascular dementia, and in rats depleted in folate and vitamin B12, Cd320 KO mice with selective B12 brain deficiency and H19-7 neuroprogenitors lacking folate. Compared with controls, N-homocysteinylated tau and MAP1 were increased and accumulated in protein aggregates and tangles in the cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum of patients and animals. N-homocysteinylation dissociated tau and MAPs from β-tubulin, and MS analysis showed that it targets lysine residues critical for their binding to β-tubulin. N-homocysteinylation increased in rats exposed to vitamin B12 and folate deficit during gestation and lactation and remained significantly higher when they became 450 days-old, despite returning to normal diet at weaning, compared with controls. It was correlated with plasma homocysteine (Hcy) and brain expression of methionine tRNAsynthetase (MARS), the enzyme required for the synthesis of Hcy-thiolactone, the substrate of N-homocysteinylation. Experimental inactivation of MARS prevented the N-homocysteinylation of tau and MAP1, and the dissociation of tau and MAP1 from β-tubulin and PSD95 in cultured neuroprogenitors. In conclusion, increased N-homocysteinylation of tau and MAP1 is a mechanism of brain ageing that depends on Hcy concentration and expression of MARS enzyme. Its irreversibility and cumulative occurrence throughout life may explain why B12 and folate supplementation of the elderly has limited effects, if any, to prevent pathological brain ageing and cognitive decline.

We used two-dimensional correlation spectroscopy (2D-COS) integrated with Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) to explore the adsorption between sludge HA (HA) and three metal ions (Cu, Ni, and Pb). The resulting adsorbing data conformed to the isotherm of Langmuir adsorption. The maximum capacity values (qm) were 5.34, 1.49, and 26.29.8 mg/g for Cu, Ni, and Pb, respectively.

These non-dietary exposures were combined with dietary exposure estimates using the Monte Carlo Risk Assessment software to produce a distribution of aggregated and cumulative exposures. Compounds are weighted by relative potency to generate a measure of overall risk. Uncertainty quantification was also included in the distribution of exposures. These tools are flexible to allow diverse sources of exposure and can provide important information to decision-makers and help to prioritise testing of pesticide mixtures. Including non-dietary sources changed the prioritisation of pesticide mixtures, when compared to dietary exposure alone.",Toxicity and developmental effect of cucurbitacin E from Citrullus colocynthis L. (Cucurbitales: Cucurbitaceae) against Spodoptera litura Fab. and a non-target earthworm Eisenia fetida Savigny.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30734910,Environmental science and pollution research international,2019 02 08,"Pest management with natural botanical insecticides is a significant implementation for the sustainability of agroecosystem by reducing the unnecessary risk from the inputs of synthetic insecticides. In this research, we isolated the bioactive compound cucurbitacin E from Citrullus colocynthis (L.) Schrad, and their toxicological effects were screened against different larval instars of Spodoptera litura. The bioactive compound cucurbitacin E was chemically characterized through TLC, FT-IR, and NMR analyses. The larval mortality bioassay revealed that the larvae exposed to cucurbitacin E at the discriminating dose of 50 ppm display higher mortality rate against second (93.8%), third (86.4%), and fourth (73.2%) instar respectively. The lethal concentrations (LC50 and LC90) was detected as 15.84 and 67.60 ppm for third instar respectively. The sub-lethal concentration of cucurbitacin E (2, 4, and 6 ppm) intentionally altered the percentage of survival, pupation, fecundity, and egg hatchability of S. litura. Moreover, antifeedant activity of cucurbitacin E was analyzed using choice-based test. In addition, we found the toxic effects of cucurbitacin E (50 and 100 ppm) and chemical pesticides (cypermethrin and monocrotophos) against terrestrial beneficial earthworm Eisenia fetida, and the result revealed that cucurbitacin E has no harmful effect on non-target organism. Hence, the present study reveals that cucurbitacin E might be a part of a new biorational product alternative to synthetic pesticides.",The effect of ramet mortality on clonal plant growth.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30734908,Theory in biosciences = Theorie in den Biowissenschaften,2019 02 08,"Clonal plants grow horizontally by producing multiple physiological individuals (ramets). We studied clonal growth in a homogeneous environment using a dynamic spatial model based on a stochastic cellular automaton. We investigated different growth forms from the aspect of ramet mortality. Non-steady-state and quasi-steady-state cases were defined, and we determined the number of steps suitable for making a reliable difference between these two types of cases. This given number of steps was used when testing for the proportion of quasi-steady-state cases in 1000 repetitions. We also tested the efficiency of occupation in these cases. Our expectation was that higher occupation would be associated with lower ramet mortality. The results only partially verified this hypothesis. Though with increasing ramet mortality, the average number of ramets tended to decrease, it was not the lowest ramet mortality that resulted in the highest occupation. Our results showed that very low ramet mortality was unfavourable for the plant, as the spreading front and the area behind this front were so packed that the plant was not able to return and recolonize the vacated sites in the central area. This resulted in a lower proportion of quasi-steady-state cases and lower occupation in these cases. Our results may contribute to a deeper understanding of clonal plant growth and its limiting factors.","Seasonality and Trend Forecasting of Tuberculosis Incidence in Chongqing, China.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30734907,"Interdisciplinary sciences, computational life sciences",2019 03 11,"Tuberculosis (TB) is a global infectious disease and one of the ten leading causes of death worldwide. As TB incidence is seasonal, a reliable forecasting model that incorporates both seasonal and trend effects would be useful to improve the prevention and control of TB. In this study, the X12 autoregressive integrated moving average (X12-ARIMA) model was constructed by dividing the sequence into season term and trend term to forecast the two terms, respectively. Data regarding the TB report rate from January 2004 to December 2015 were included in the model, and the TB report data from January 2016 to December 2016 were used to validate the results. The X12-ARIMA model was compared with the seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) model. A total of 383,797 cases were reported from January 2004 to December 2016 in Chongqing, China. The report rate of TB was highest in 2005 (151.06 per 100,000 population) and lowest in 2016 (72.58 per 100,000 population). The final X12-ARIMA model included the ARIMA (3,1,3) model for the trend term and the ARIMA (2,1,3) model for the season term. The SARIMA (1,0,2) * (1,1,1)12 model was selected for the SARIMA model. The mean absolute error (MAE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of fitting and predicting performance based on the X12-ARIMA model were less than the SARIMA model. In conclusion, the occurrence of TB in Chongqing is controlled, which may be attributed to socioeconomic developments and improved TB prevention and control services. Applying the X12-ARIMA model is an effective method to forecast and analyze the trend and seasonality of TB.",Substance Use and HIV Among Justice-Involved Youth: Intersecting Risks.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30734906,Current HIV/AIDS reports,2019 03 29,"This review discusses recent advances in research on the intersection of HIV prevention and substance use among youth involved with the justice system.

Cord blood transplantation (CBT) is a potential re-transplantation option. Total body irradiation (TBI) is often incorporated into the pre-salvage CBT conditioning regimen following PGF; however, patients experiencing PGF are not always amenable to TBI, and non-TBI regimens for salvage CBT should be established. Here, we report five patients with hematologic malignancies who received salvage CBT for PGF following a non-TBI regimen using fludarabine (Flu), melphalan (Mel), and low-dose anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG). The median intervals between the failed allo-SCT and salvage CBT, as well as between the diagnosis of PGF and salvage CBT, were 37 days and 8 days, respectively. The median neutrophil recovery period was 21 days (range 18-21 days). Four of five patients achieved neutrophil engraftment following salvage CBT; all four exhibited sustained engraftment with complete donor chimerism. Three of the five patients were alive after a median follow-up time of 907 days (range 315-909 days) post-salvage CBT; two patients died of causes unrelated to recurrence. These data suggest that CBT following the non-TBI regimen described here is feasible in patients with PGF.",Downregulation of the auxin transporter gene SlPIN8 results in pollen abortion in tomato.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30734902,Plant molecular biology,2019 04 10,"SlPIN8 is expressed specifically within tomato pollen, and that it is involved in tomato pollen development and intracellular auxin homeostasis. The auxin (IAA) transport protein PIN-FORMED (PIN) plays key roles in various aspects of plant development. The biological role of the auxin transporter SlPIN8 in tomato development remains unclear. Here, we examined the expression pattern of the SlPIN8 gene in vegetative and reproductive organs of tomato. RNA interference (RNAi) transgenic lines specifically silenced for the SlPIN8 gene were generated to identify the role of SlPIN8 in pollen development. We found that SlPIN8 mRNA is expressed specifically within tomato pollen. In the anthers, the highest mRNA expression and β-glucuronidase (GUS) activity of promoter-SlPIN8-GUS was detected during late stages of anther development, when pollen maturation occurred. The downregulation of SlPIN8 did not drastically affect the vegetative growth of tomato. However, in SlPIN8-RNAi transgenic plants, approximately 80% of the pollen grains were identified to be abnormal and lack viability; they were shriveled and flattened. Furthermore, the downregulation of SlPIN8 affected the gene expression of some anther development-specific proteins. SlPIN8-RNAi transgenic plants induced seedless fruits because of defective pollen function rather than defective female gametophyte function. In addition, SlPIN8 was found to localize to the endoplasmic reticulum, consistent with the changes in the auxin levels of SlPIN8-RNAi lines, whereas the level of free IAA was increased in SlPIN8-overexpressing protoplasts, indicating that SlPIN8 is involved in intracellular auxin homeostasis.",Diagnostic Accuracy of Glycated Haemoglobin and Average Glucose Values in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Treated with Premixed Insulin.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30734901,"Diabetes therapy : research, treatment and education of diabetes and related disorders",2019 04 16,Studies assessing the relationship between glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) and average blood glucose (ABG) were conducted in small groups of patients on different treatments and may be biased for these reasons.

We characterized microminipig as a laboratory animal by analyzing fluvoxamine-induced cardiovascular and dermatological responses under halothane anesthesia. Fluvoxamine maleate was infused in doses of 0.1, 1, and 10 mg/kg over 10 min with a pause of 20 min (n = 4). The peak plasma concentrations were 35, 320, and 1906 ng/mL, of which free plasma concentrations were estimated as 20, 187, and 1108 nmol/L, respectively. The low and middle doses did not alter any cardiovascular variable. The high dose increased heart rate and mean blood pressure, prolonged QRS width, but shortened QT interval, whereas no significant change was detected in PR interval or QTcF. Moreover, it induced systemic erythema on the skin. Pretreatment of H1/5-HT2A antagonist cyproheptadine hydrochloride sesquihydrate in a dose of 0.3 mg/kg significantly attenuated the fluvoxamine-induced pressor response; but tended to further enhance sinus automaticity, atrioventricular nodal conduction; and ventricular repolarization in addition to intraventricular conduction delay; whereas it markedly suppressed onset of systemic erythema (n = 4). In microminipigs, cardiovascular adverse effects of the high dose may be manifested as a sum of its inhibitory action on the cardiac ionic channels and its stimulatory effects on serotonergic and adrenergic systems, whereas dermatologic reaction can be induced primarily through H1/5-HT2A receptor-dependent mechanism. Thus, microminipigs may be used for analyzing such multifarious adverse events of clinical serotonergic pharmacotherapy.",Multiplicative rates model for recurrent events in case-cohort studies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30734884,Lifetime data analysis,2019 02 14,"In large prospective cohort studies, accumulation of covariate information and follow-up data make up the majority of the cost involved in the study. This might lead to the study being infeasible when there are some expensive variables and/or the event is rare. Prentice (Biometrika 73(1):1-11, 1986) proposed the case-cohort study for time to event data to tackle this problem. There has been extensive research on the analysis of univariate and clustered failure time data, where the clusters are formed among different individuals under case-cohort sampling scheme. However, recurrent event data are quite common in biomedical and public health research. In this paper, we propose case-cohort sampling schemes for recurrent events. We consider a multiplicative rates model for the recurrent events and propose a weighted estimating equations approach for parameter estimation. We show that the estimators are consistent and asymptotically normally distributed. The proposed estimator performed well in finite samples in our simulation studies. For illustration purposes, we examined the association between prior occurrence of measles on acute lower respiratory tract infections (ALRI) among young children in Brazil.",Analysis of Genetic Diversity and Development of a SCAR Marker for Green Tea (Camellia sinensis) Cultivars in Zhejiang Province: The Most Famous Green Tea-Producing Area in China.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30734883,Biochemical genetics,2019 02 08,"Camellia sinensis (L.) O. Kuntze is one of the most important non-alcoholic beverage crops in Asian and African countries. In recent years, many green tea cultivars have been released and played an important role in improving the production and quality of tea trees. The objectives of this study were to assess the genetic diversity of the eighteen main green tea cultivars in Zhejiang Province-the most famous green tea-producing area of China-using start codon-targeted (SCoT) markers and to develop a specific sequence-characterized amplified region (SCAR) marker for application in cultivar diagnosis. Thirty-one SCoT primers produced 264 loci, 226 of which were polymorphic. The genetic similarity coefficients among these green tea cultivars ranged from 0.587 to 0.814, indicating that a high level of genetic diversity was present. Both a UPGMA dendrogram and a PCoA plot grouped the tea cultivars into three groups. The partitioning of groups in the UPGMA and PCoA was similar, and much of the clustering was highly consistent with the classification of tea cultivars according to their genetic backgrounds. A unique SCoT band, SCoT4-1649, specific to the tea cultivar 'Yingshuang,' was transformed into a SCAR marker. This SCAR marker is highly useful for the identification and germplasm conservation of green tea cultivars.",Acceptability and Predictors of Uptake of Anti-retroviral Pre-exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) Among Fishing Communities in Uganda: A Cross-Sectional Discrete Choice Experiment Survey.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30734882,AIDS and behavior,2019 02 08,"We used a discrete choice experiment to assess the acceptability and potential uptake of HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) among 713 HIV-negative members of fishing communities in Uganda.

Product attributes were HIV prevention effectiveness, sexually transmitted infection (STI) prevention, contraception, waiting time, and secrecy of use. Data were analysed using mixed multinomial logit and latent class models. HIV prevention effectiveness was viewed as the most important attribute. Both genders preferred oral PrEP. Women least preferred the vaginal ring and men the implant. Condom use was predicted to decrease by one third among men, and not to change amongst women. Oral PrEP and other new prevention technologies are acceptable among fishing communities and may have substantial demand. Future work should explore utility of multiple product technologies that combine contraception with HIV and other STI prevention.",Clinical outcome of patients with recurrent non-small cell lung cancer after trimodality therapy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30734881,Surgery today,2019 02 08,The purpose of this study was to review the clinical course of patients with recurrence after induction chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery (trimodality therapy) for locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (LA-NSCLC) and to identify the factors associated with favorable clinical outcome after recurrence.,Correction to: Long-term results of intersphincteric resection for low rectal cancer in Japan.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30734880,Surgery today,2019 05 08,In the original publication Fig. 2 and Table 4 were incorrectly published.

Retrospective, singe-center, cohort study in adults with MRSAB 2008 to 2018. Independent predictors of mortality were identified through multivariable logistic regression. A scoring model was derived using a regression coefficient-based scoring method. Discriminatory ability was assessed using the c statistic. A total of 455 patients were included. Thirty-day mortality was 16.3%. The MRSAB score consisted of six variables: age, respiratory rate, Glasgow Coma scale, renal failure, hospital-acquired MRSAB, and infective endocarditis or lower respiratory tract infection source. The score demonstrated very good discrimination (c statistic 0.8662, 95% CI 0.824-0.909) and was superior to the APACHE II (P = 0.043) and the Pitt bacteremia (P < 0.001) scores. A weighted combination of six independent variables routinely measured in patients with MRSAB can be used to predict, with high discrimination, 30-day all-cause mortality.

MicroRNA-23b (miR-23b) is a multifunctional miRNA that is considered to regulate immunosuppression in sepsis. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of miR-23b on cardiomyopathy induced by sepsis and to explore the potential mechanism involved. Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to cecal ligation and puncture (CLP), and the level of miR-23b at different time points was measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Then, we overexpressed miR-23b in vivo and in vitro. The rats were subjected to CLP 7 days after transfection. Cardiac function, inflammatory response, and heart tissues were examined 3 days thereafter. In an in vitro experiment, H9C2 cardiomyoblasts were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) after transfection of miR-23b, following which apoptosis and the level of NF-κB were analyzed. The expression of miR-23b was upregulated during polymicrobial sepsis, and transfection of miR-23b lentivirus improved the outcome of sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy by attenuating inflammatory responses and protecting against histopathological damage. In in vitro experiments, elevated miR-23b inhibited excessive apoptosis of cardiomyocytes, which may be because activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway was inhibited by the decreased levels of TRAF6 and IKKβ. Therefore, miR-23b improved sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy by attenuating the inflammatory response, suppressing apoptosis, and preventing NF-κB activation via targeted inhibition of TRAF6 and IκκB. These results indicated that miR-23b may represent a novel therapeutic approach for clinical treatment of sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy.",Correction to: Schisandrin B Attenuates Inflammation in LPS-Induced Sepsis through miR-17-5p Downregulating TLR4.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30734877,Inflammation,2019 04 11,"The original version of this article contained mistakes, and the authors would like to correct them.",Self-Regulation Approach to Training Child and Family Practitioners.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30734874,Clinical child and family psychology review,2019 03 28,"Evidence-based psychotherapies or programs (EBPs) exist for most mental health disorders that occur in childhood; however, the majority of children with a mental health disorder do not receive such treatments. This research-practice gap has been attributed to a range of factors that complicate the delivery of EBPs in everyday practice. While most suggestions to bridge this gap have focused on how to develop EBPs that will have a better fit for the clinical settings in which they will ultimately be deployed, a useful adjunct is to enhance practitioners' capacity to flexibly deliver EBPs to manage these factors. We propose that the extent to which a practitioner is able to change their own behaviour in response to cues and information about the current needs of their clients, and do so while maintaining the integrity of an EBP, may be a function of practitioners' self-regulatory capacity. In this conceptual paper, we describe a model of self-regulation that can be applied to child and family practitioners. We argue that practitioners with greater self-regulatory capacity are more likely to take up EBPs, sustain their use of them and have superior outcomes with clients. We draw on our experience in disseminating a system of parenting support to illustrate how practitioners' self-regulatory capacity can be enhanced while simultaneously receiving training in an EBP. Advantages and disadvantages of a self-regulatory approach to training are discussed and directions for future research are offered."

The genus Hepatiarius Feizullaev, 1961 accommodated two species: Hepatiarius sudarikovi Feizullaev, 1961 and H. longissimus Linstow, 1883. Recently, some experts have suppressed Hepatiarius as a junior synonym of Opisthorchis Blanchard, 1895 based on morphological features alone. Prior to the present study, no molecular data either from nuclear or from mitochondrial DNA was available for any species of this genus. In the present study, four specimens of H. sudarikovi Feizullaev, 1961 were recovered from the bile ducts of the little egret, Egretta garzetta. The complete sequences of the internal transcribed spacers (ITS-1 and ITS-2) of ribosomal DNA (rDNA) and the nearly complete mitochondrial genome sequences were determined and the phylogenetic relationship of H. sudarikovi with related taxa was assessed based on the mitochondrial (mt) DNA sequences. The sequence similarity in the ITS rDNA between H. sudarikovi and Opisthorchis felineus was higher (97.62% in ITS-1 and 96.22% in ITS-2) than with other opisthorchiids. Phylogenetic analysis using Bayesian inference (BI) based on the concatenated amino acid sequences of 12 protein-coding genes (PCGs) clustered H. sudarikovi into the clade of opisthorchiids, with O. felineus being the closest related species, which supports the affinity of H. sudarikovi with trematodes in the genus Opisthorchis. This is the first avian liver fluke whose nearly complete mitochondrial genome was sequenced. The mtDNA sequences of H. sudarikovi, in combination with its rDNA sequences, provide novel resources of genetic markers for the identification, species differentiation, and systematic studies of H. sudarikovi with other avian opisthorchiid flukes.",A novel optical approach for determination of prolactin based on Pr-MOF nanofibers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30734859,Analytical and bioanalytical chemistry,2019 04 17,"The analytical quantification and follow-up of the hormone prolactin is very important in clinical diagnosis (e.g., in cases of breast cancer), treatment, and the medical laboratory. The development of a new simple, fast, and less costly method is of considerable importance. Novel praseodymium metal-organic framework nanofibers (Pr-MOF-NFs) were synthesized by a facile and simple method for the determination of human prolactin in serum samples. The Pr-MOF-NFs were well characterized with several spectroscopic tools, such as mass spectrometry, Fourier transform IR spectroscopy, UV-vis spectroscopy, elemental analysis, X-ray diffraction, field-emission scanning electron microscopy combined with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. The photoluminescence of Pr-MOF-NFs was investigated, and the results revealed that Pr-MOF-NFs could be used as a sensitive and selective nanofiber optical sensor for the detection of human prolactin. The calibration graph was studied over a wide prolactin concentration range of 0-200 ng/mL, with limits of detection and quantitation of 0.276 and 0.838 ng/mL, respectively, lower than the values mentioned in previous reports. The correlation coefficient was 0.9792. Moreover, the Pr-MOF-NFs were applied successfully for the detection of serum human prolactin at clinically applicable concentrations without interference from several types of hormones and various interfering analytes.

Herein, a novel integrated strategy combining UHPLC/Q-Orbitrap-MS techniques with chemometrics analysis is proposed for the discrimination of PSA materials. We developed a comprehensive method integrating a nontargeted bidirectionally screened (NTBDS) MS data set and a targeted extraction peak area analysis for the characterization of triterpenoid saponins of PSA from different species. After that, partial least-squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) was performed on the obtained MS data set and the parameter variable importance for the projection (VIP) value and P value were employed to screen the valuable MS features to discriminate PSA from different species. In addition, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve is used to verify the reliability of MS features. Finally, heatmap visualization was employed to clarify the distribution of the identified triterpenoid saponins, and four medicinal species of PSA were successfully differentiated. Additionally, 34 constituents were reported in PSAs for the first time, 81 triterpenoid saponins were identified as differential components, and 12 chemical ingredients were characterized as potential chemical markers to differentiate the four officinal PSA herbs. This is the first time that the differences in different PSA herbs have been observed systematically at the chemical level. The results suggested that using the identified characteristic components as chemical markers to identify different PSA herbs was effective and viable. This method provides promising perspectives in the analysis and identification of the ingredients of Chinese herbal medicines, and the identification of similar herbs from the same species.",Determination of the polyphenolic fraction of Pistacia vera L. kernel extracts by comprehensive two-dimensional liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry detection.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30734857,Analytical and bioanalytical chemistry,2019 02 08,"Pistachio (Pistacia vera L.) belongs to the Anacardiaceae family and it is a small tree species. It is native of the Middle East and Central Asia, but currently, it is cultivated also in California and in some Mediterranean countries, such as Greece and Italy. The most important pistachio producers are Iran, the USA, and Turkey. Besides being a delicious nut, pistachio, due to its wholesome nutritional properties, could be considered as a functional food. According to the results of several studies, pistachios have been proven to have various groups of valuable phytochemicals such as anthocyanins, flavan-3-ols, proanthocyanidins, flavonols, isoflavones, flavanones, stilbenes, and phenolic acids, possessing excellent biological activities. The most common analytical technique employed for their analysis is represented by liquid chromatography coupled to photodiode array and mass spectrometry detection. However, conventional LC can present some limits especially in terms of resolving power. In this contribution, as a powerful alternative, comprehensive two-dimensional liquid chromatography (LC×LC) was applied to the determination of the polyphenolic fraction of pistachio kernels from different geographical origins. A 150-mm micro-bore cyano column (2.7 μm dp) and 50-mm superficially porous C18 silica column (2.7 μm dp) in the first (1D) and second (2D) dimensions were employed, respectively. For boosting orthogonality, a shift 2D gradient was investigated leading to an increase in the overall peak capacity. The newly developed LC×LC method showed satisfactory linearity, sensitivity, precision and accuracy, which was then applied to sample quantitative analysis. A total of 51 different polyphenolic compounds were determined in the four samples investigated and 18 out of them are hereby reported for the first time.",DNA-modulated photosensitization: current status and future aspects in biosensing and environmental monitoring.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30734855,Analytical and bioanalytical chemistry,2019 02 08,"Recently, photosensitized oxidation has been explored in many fields of research and applications, such as photodynamic therapy (PDT) and photodynamic antimicrobial chemotherapy (PACT). Although the photosensitized generation of ROS features emerging applications, controllable management of the photosensitization process is still sometimes problematic. DNA has long been considered the carrier for genetic information. With the in-depth study of the chemical properties of DNA, the molecular function of DNA is gradually witnessed by the scientific community. Undoubtedly, the selective recognition nature of DNA endows them excellent candidate modulators for photosensitized oxidation. According to current research, reports on DNA regulation of photosensitized oxidation can be roughly divided into two categories in principle: P-Q quenching pair-switched photosensitization and host-guest interaction-switched photosensitization. In this review, the development status of these two analytical methods will be summarized, and the future development direction of DNA-modulated photosensitization in biosensing and environmental monitoring will also be prospected.",Nanobody: outstanding features for diagnostic and therapeutic applications.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30734854,Analytical and bioanalytical chemistry,2019 05 22,"Nanobodies (Nbs) have arisen as an alternative to conventional antibodies (Abs) and show great potential when used as tools in different biotechnology fields such as diagnostics and therapy.

This review summarizes these challenges, and also the latest advances in the detection of different kinds of molecules, such as proteins and small molecules, and describes their potential use for noninvasive in vivo imaging and for in vitro assays. Moreover, the unique properties of Nbs are outlined like internalization, size, thermal and chemical stability, affinity, blood clearance, and labeling procedures.

Polynorepinephrine-functionalized magnetic nanoparticles (polyNE-MNPs) are synthesized and applied to simultaneously extract three β-blockers (carteolol, metoprolol, and betaxolol). The prepared polyNE-MNPs are spherical with a diameter of 198 ± 17 nm and the thickness of the polyNE coating is about 14 nm. PolyNE possesses abundant catechol hydroxyl and secondary amine groups, endowing the MNPs with excellent hydrophilicity. Under the optimum conditions, the extraction efficiencies of polyNE-MNPs for β-blockers are in the range of 89.6 to 100%, with relative standard deviations (RSDs) below 3.5%. The extraction process can be finished in 4 min. Field-enhanced sample injection (FESI) in chiral CE is constructed to further enhance the sensitivities of β-blocker enantiomers. The limits of detection for β-blocker enantiomers by the FESI-CE with polyNE-MNPs are in the range of 0.401 to 1.59 ng mL-1. The practicability of this method in real samples is evaluated by analysis of human urine samples. The recoveries for each enantiomer of β-blockers in the real samples range from 89.5 to 92.8%, with RSDs ranging from 0.37 to 5.9%. The whole detection process can be finished in less than 0.5 h.

Early electrophysiological studies characterized and grouped PPN neurons based on certain functional properties (i.e., the presence or absence of the A-current, spike latency, and low threshold spikes). Although other electrophysiological characteristics of these neurons were also described (as high threshold membrane potential oscillations, great differences in spontaneous firing rate and the presence or absence of the M-current), systematic assessment of these properties and correlation of them with morphological markers are still missing. In this work, we conducted electrophysiological experiments on brain slices of genetically identified cholinergic neurons in the PPN. Electrophysiological properties were compared with rostrocaudal location of the neuronal soma and selected morphometric features obtained with post hoc reconstruction. We found that functional subgroups had different proportions in the rostral and caudal subregions of the nucleus. Neurons with A-current can be divided to early-firing and late-firing neurons, where the latter type was found exclusively in the caudal subregion. Similar to this, different parameters of high threshold membrane potential oscillations also showed characteristic rostrocaudal distribution. Furthermore, based on our data, we propose that high threshold oscillations rather emerge from neuronal somata and not from the proximal dendrites. In summary, we demonstrated the existence and spatial distribution of functional subgroups of genetically identified PPN cholinergic neurons, which are in accordance with differences found in projection and in vivo functional findings of the subregions. Being aware of functional differences of PPN subregions will help the design and analysis of experiments using genetically encoded opto- and chemogenetic markers for in vivo experiments.",Can a Prebiotic Formulation Reduce Frailty Levels in Older People?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30734832,The Journal of frailty & aging,2019 03 22,The purpose of this study was to examine whether a prebiotic formulation reduces frailty index (FI) levels in older people.,Psychosocioeconomic Precariousness and Frailty: The Respective Contribution in Predicting Mortality.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30734831,The Journal of frailty & aging,2019 03 22,"Low socioeconomic status and frailty are factors of vulnerability in old age.

To facilitate insertion of ZnPPIX into hexa-coordinated globins, apoproteins prepared via butanone extraction were unfolded by the addition of GuHCl and subsequently slowly refolded in the presence of ZnPPIX. The absorption/emission spectra of ZnPPIX reconstituted hCygb are similar to those observed for ZnPPIX reconstituted myoglobin whereas the absorption and emission spectra of ZnPPIX reconstituted hNgb are blue shifted by ∼2 nm. Different steady state absorption and emission properties of ZnPPIX incorporated in hCygb and hNgb are consistent with distinct hydrogen bonding interactions between ZnPPIX and the globin matrix. The fluorescence lifetime of ZnPPIX in hexa-coordinated globins is bimodal pointing towards increased heterogeneity of the heme binding cavity in hCygb and hNgb. ZnPPIX reconstituted Ngb binds to cytochrome c with the same affinity as reported for the native protein, suggesting that fluorescent analogues of Cygb and Ngb can be readily employed to monitor interactions between vertebrate hexa-coordinated globins and other proteins.",Transition from curvature sensing to generation in a vesicle driven by protein binding strength and membrane tension.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30734812,Soft matter,2019 03 11,"The ability of proteins to sense and/or generate membrane curvature is crucial for many biological processes inside the cell. We introduce a model for the binding and unbinding of curvature inducing proteins on vesicles using Dynamic Triangulation Monte Carlo (DTMC) simulations. In our study, the interaction between membrane curvature and protein binding is characterised by the binding affinity parameter μ, which indicates the interaction strength. We demonstrate that both sensing and generation of curvature can be observed in the same system as a function of the protein binding affinity on the membrane. Our results show that at low μ values, proteins only sense membrane curvature, whereas at high μ values, they induce curvature. The transition between sensing and generation regimes is marked by a sharp change in the μ-dependence of the protein bound fraction. We present ways to quantitatively characterise these two regimes. We also observe that imposing tension on the membrane (through internal excess pressure for liposomes) extends the region of curvature sensing in the parameter space.",Capillary displacement of viscous liquids in a multi-layered porous medium.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30734811,Soft matter,2019 03 04,"Capillary driven displacement of viscous liquids into a porous matrix plays a significant role in several porous media applications such as fractured oil reservoirs and paper micro-fluidic devices. The inherent heterogeneity in porous media is known to cause the invading fluid front to lead in narrow pores followed by large pores during spontaneous imbibition. Here, we use experiments in a layered porous medium to show that the leading front is not always in the narrow pores. We observe in a two layered porous medium that the fluid front always advances faster in the narrow pores. However, in a multi-layered porous medium, the front displacement is strongly dependent on the arrangement of the layers, the relative difference between the capillary pressure, the permeability of the layers, and the viscosity ratio of the wetting and the non-wetting fluids. We also develop a one-dimensional lubrication approximation model based on the experimental observations, which predicts the imbibition dynamics in the layers seen in the experiments. Additionally, from our model, we present a scaling law governing the leading front in the porous layers. We also predict using our model that the volume imbibed in the layered porous medium cannot be determined by using the effective porous medium properties and a detailed knowledge of the characteristics of the layers is required to accurately predict the overall imbibition of the layered porous medium.",Live cell super resolution imaging by radial fluctuations using fluorogen binding tags.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30734810,Nanoscale,2019 04 12,"Fluorescence-Activating and absorption-Shifting Tag (FAST) is a novel genetically encoded optical highlighter probe.

This results from their inherent properties such as a large portion of surface coordinatively unsaturated metal atoms, rapid mass transfer and enhanced conductivity. However, 2D MOFs have a strong tendency to aggregate, which severely limits their potential application in the OER. Here, novel 2D Ni-BDC/Ni(OH)2 (BDC stands for 1,4-benzenedicarboxylate, C8H4O4) hybrid nanosheets are synthesized via a facile sonication-assisted solution method. Because of the rational material design, the large surface area of Ni-BDC is maintained. Significantly, after coupling, the electronic structure of Ni atoms in the Ni(OH)2 component is well modified, leading to the generation of Ni cations with higher oxidation states, which are desirable for the OER. As-prepared Ni-BDC/Ni(OH)2 exhibits high activity, favorable kinetics and strong durability towards the OER. Specifically, the OER current density of Ni-BDC/Ni(OH)2 is 82.5 mA cm-2 at 1.6 V versus a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), which is significantly greater than those of Ni-BDC (5.5 times), Ni(OH)2 (20.6 times) and Ir/C (3.0 times).

Among these are transition metals (TM) participating as inorganic and organic cofactors of fundamental enzymes. While the understanding of how plant transporters facilitate TMs to the very near environment of the bacteroid is expanding, our knowledge on how bacteroid transporters integrate to TM homeostasis mechanisms in the plant host is still limited. This is significantly relevant considering the low solubility and scarcity of TMs in soils, and the in crescendo gradient of TM bioavailability rhizobia faces during the infection and bacteroid differentiation processes. In the present work, we review the main metal transporter families found in rhizobia, their role in free-living conditions and, when known, in symbiosis.

The reactions are initiated by CO multiphoton absorption of 800 nm light in strong optical fields using two different polarization configurations based on shaped chirped pulses. The observation of Swan band emission indicates that C2(d3Πg) is a reaction product. The optical polarization is in the form of either an optical centrifuge or a dynamic polarization grating. In each case, the strong field aligns CO molecules and induces multiphoton absorption. Power-dependent measurements indicate at least seven photons are absorbed by CO; CO(a3Π) is a likely reactant candidate based on kinetic modeling. Relative reaction efficiencies are determined by measuring Swan band emission intensities. For a CO pressure of 100 Torr and an optical intensity of I = 2.0 × 1013 W cm-2, the relative C2(d3Πg) yield with the dynamic polarization grating is twice that with the optical centrifuge. The extent of CO rotational energy was determined for both optical polarizations using high-resolution transient IR absorption for a number of CO states with J = 62-73 and Erot up to 10 400 cm-1. Optical centrifuge excitation generates at least 2.5 times more rotationally excited CO molecules per quantum state than the dynamic polarization grating. The results indicate that the effect of large amounts of CO rotational energy is to reduce the yield of the C2 products.",Enhanced photoelectrochemical hydrogen generation in neutral electrolyte using non-vacuum processed CIGS photocathodes with an earth-abundant cobalt sulfide catalyst.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30734787,"Chemical communications (Cambridge, England)",2019 02 27,"This work reports the novelty of using eco-friendly and cost-effective non-vacuum Electrostatic Spray-Assisted Vapour Deposited Cu(In,Ga)SSe (CIGS) thin films as photocathodes, combined with the earth abundant cobalt sulfide (Co-S) as a catalyst to accelerate the kinetics of photogenerated electron transfer and hydrogen generation for photoelectrochemical water splitting.

Here, we carry out Brownian dynamics simulations to explore the behavior of a single self-attracting chain in a suspension of self-propelling particles (SPPs). As the propelling force increases, the globule-stretch (G-S) transition of the chain occurs due to the enhanced disturbance from the SPPs. Two distinct mechanisms of the transition in the limits of low and high rotational diffusion rates of SPPs have been observed: shear-induced stretching at a low rate and collision-induced melting at a high rate. The G-S and S-G (stretch-globule) curves form a hysteresis loop at the low rate, while they merge at the high rate. Besides, we find that two competing effects result in a non-monotonic dependence of the G-S transition on SPP density at the low rate. Our results suggest an alternative approach to manipulating the folding and unfolding of (bio)polymers by utilizing active agents.","Polycyclic N-oxides: high performing, low sensitivity energetic materials.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30734785,"Chemical communications (Cambridge, England)",2019 02 27,"Polycyclic N-oxides were developed based on the heterocycles 1,2,4,5-tetrazine and 4H,8H-difurazano[3,4-b:3',4'-e]pyrazine.

After a fast, uncatalyzed and non-destructive trifluoroacetylation of all PHA hydroxyl groups, OHVs are calculated through 19F-NMR measurements, comparing integral values of the only two signals in the spectra: the fluorinated hydroxyl groups and the internal standard (trifluorotoluene) signals. Furthermore, the combined ex situ functionalization with a simple workup of the fluorinated polymer allowed to obtain spectra with an improved signal/noise ratio and short acquisition time if compared to 1H-NMR-based methods. The results obtained by 19F-NMR measurements are then validated by the established standard method based on acid/base titration and the 1H-NMR-based method. The proposed approach shows to be valuable not only for low molecular weight PHAs, but also for high molecular weight samples, which typically cannot be analysed by conventional 1H-NMR-based methods due to the very low concentration of hydroxyl terminal groups. Thanks to the observed high reliability, the method was also successfully applied to evaluate the OHVs of various commercial hydroxyl terminated polymers with different molecular weights in order to further show its wide applicability."

The film grown on LAO experiences a compressive strain and shows metallic behavior with the onset of a weak resistivity upturn below 2 K which is linked to the onset of weak localization contribution. Films grown on STO and NGO show a cross-over from a positive temperature coefficient (PTC) resistance regime to negative temperature coefficient (NTC) resistance regime at definite temperatures. We establish that a cross-over from PTC to NTC on cooling does not necessarily constitute a MIT because the extrapolated conductivity at zero temperature [Formula: see text] though small (<10 S cm-1) is finite, signaling the existence of a bad metallic state and absence of an activated transport. The value of [Formula: see text] for films grown on NGO is reduced by a factor of 40 compared to that for films grown on STO. We show that a combination of certain physical factors makes substituted nickelate (that are known to exhibit first-order Mott type transition), undergo a continuous transition as seen in systems undergoing disorder/composition driven Anderson transition.

This research was carried out in both domestic and wild environments throughout a Northeastern rural locality. Triatomines were captured in both peridomicile and wild environments, obtaining 508 specimens of triatomines, of which 99.6% were Triatoma brasiliensis. Insects were captured in 10 (18.5%) peridomiciles with an average of 8.3 triatomines per residence. Triatoma brasiliensis nymphs and adults were found in six peridomiciles, generating a 11.1% colonization. No T. cruzi infection was detected in the 447 peridomestic insects analyzed. On the other hand, of the 55 sylvatic T. brasiliensis molecularly examined for T. cruzi, 12 (21%) were positive, all harboring T. cruzi I. The blood meal analysis by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay from gut content revealed that both peridomestic and wild triatomine populations fed mainly on birds, refractory to the parasite, which may explain the null rate of natural infection prevalence in the domestic environment. However, infected triatomines for potential home infestation within the radius of insect dispersion capacity were registered in rock outcrops around the dwellings. Anthropogenic environmental influences are able to rapidly alter these scenarios. Therefore, to avoid disease transmission to humans, we recommend constant vector control combined with periodic serological surveillance.

We provide a new perspective on the integration of HOC technology and biosensing to develop a new sensor-based HOC platform.",Role of Seminal Plasma Proteins in Effective Zygote Formation- A Success Road to Pregnancy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30734670,Protein and peptide letters,2019 04 24,"Seminal plasma proteins contributed by secretions of accessory glands plays a copious role in fertilization. Their role is overlooked for decades and even now, as Artificial Reproduction Techniques (ART) excludes the plasma components in the procedures. Recent evidences suggest the importance of these proteins starting from imparting fertility status to men, fertilization and till successful implantation of the conceptus in the female uterus. Seminal plasma is rich in diverse proteins, but a major part of the seminal plasma is constituted by very lesser number of proteins. This makes isolation and further research on non abundant protein a tough task. With the advent of much advanced proteomic techniques and bio informatics tools, studying the protein component of seminal plasma has become easy and promising. This review is focused on the role of seminal plasma proteins on various walks of fertilization process and thus, the possible exploitation of seminal plasma proteins for understanding the etiology of male related infertility issues. In addition, a compilation of seminal plasma proteins and their functions has been done.",Preface.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30734669,"Recent patents on food, nutrition & agriculture",2019 03 14,,Acute lead arsenate poisoning in beef cattle in Uruguay.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30734668,"Journal of veterinary diagnostic investigation : official publication of the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians, Inc",2019 05 22,"We describe and illustrate lesions in an outbreak of lead arsenate poisoning in beef cattle that ingested pesticide residues stored in an abandoned building of a former orange orchard. Of 70 exposed cattle, 14 had diarrhea, paresis, ataxia, recumbency, and/or seizures. Ten of the affected animals died after a clinical course of 12-18 h. Pathologic findings in 3 steers included extensive necrohemorrhagic, ulcerative rumenitis, omasitis, and abomasitis; lymphocytolysis in lymphoid organs; and nephrosis. Hepatic arsenic and lead levels in cases 1-3 were 20, 24, and 31 ppm, and 8.3, 25, and 9.4 ppm, respectively. Lesions in the forestomachs and lymphoid tissues have been rarely reported in cases of lead arsenate poisoning. In southern South America, these lesions are indistinguishable from those produced by Baccharis coridifolia, a toxic plant that contains macrocyclic trichothecenes, thus these conditions should be considered in the differential diagnosis of necrotizing lesions in alimentary and lymphoid organs.",Dermoid sinus type VI associated with spina bifida and tethered cord syndrome in a French Bulldog.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30734666,"Journal of veterinary diagnostic investigation : official publication of the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians, Inc",2019 05 22,"A 4-mo-old French bulldog was presented with acute onset pain and reluctance to move.

An interpretative phenomenological analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30734665,Archives of suicide research : official journal of the International Academy for Suicide Research,2019 03 21,"Few studies have explored the impact self-harm has on family members, with none specifically focusing on physical and psychosomatic responses following a family member's high-risk self-harm Therefore, this study aims to explore the health impact of experiencing a family member's high-risk self-harm. Participants represented family members of consecutive cases of self-harm, who were recruited from the Suicide Support and Information System - A Case-Control Study (SSIS-ACE). Qualitative interviews were conducted with 9 participants whose family member presented to a large tertiary hospital in Ireland with high-risk self-harm. Interpretative phenomenological analysis was conducted. Qualitative findings indicated 4 superordinate themes in relation to experiences following a family member's presentation to hospital following an episode of high-risk self-harm (1) implications for health and well-being; (2) process of meaning-making; (3) feelings of responsibility and (4) challenges with support network. Participants consistently experienced adverse health impacts including vomiting, hypertension, and depression. The findings imply that caring for their own and their family members' well-being, together with challenges with accessing health services underscores the importance of family members being proactively contacted by healthcare professionals to alleviate these detrimental health effects.","A reporter system evaluates tumorigenesis, metastasis, β-catenin/MMP regulation, and druggability.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30734664,Tissue engineering. Part A,2019 02 08,"Cancer invasion, metastasis, and therapy resistance are the crucial phenomena in cancer malignancy. The high-expression of matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) is a biomarker as well as a causal factor of cancer invasiveness and metastatic activity. However, a regulatory mechanism underlying MMP9 expression in cancer is not clarified yet. Additionally, a new strategy for anti-cancer drug discovery is becoming an important clue. In the present study, we aimed (i) to develop a novel reporter system evaluating tumorigenesis, invasiveness, metastasis, and druggability with a combination of three-dimensional (3D) tumoroid model and Mmp9 promoter and (ii) to examine pharmacological actions of anti-cancer medications using this reporter system. High expression and genetic amplification of MMP9 were found in colon cancer cases. We found that proximal promoter sequences of MMP9 in murine and human contained conserved binding sites for transcription factors β-catenin/TCF/LEF, glucocorticoid receptor (GR), and NF-κB. The murine Mmp9 promoter (-569 to +19) was markedly activated in metastatic colon cancer cells and additionally activated by tumoroid formation and by β-catenin signaling stimulator lithium chloride (LiCl). The Mmp9 promoter-driven fluorescent reporter cells enabled the monitoring of activities of MMP9/gelatinase, tumorigenesis, invasion, and metastasis in allogeneic/syngenic transplantation experiments. We also demonstrated pharmacological actions as follows. ids Dexamethasone and hydrocortisone, steroidal medications binding to GR, inhibited the Mmp9 promoter but did not inhibit tumorigenesis. On the other hand, an antimetabolite 5-fluorouracil, a golden standard for colon cancer chemotherapy, inhibited tumoroid formation but did not inhibit Mmp9 promoter activity. Notably, anti-malaria medication artesunate inhibited both tumorigenesis and the Mmp9 promoter in vitro, potentially through inhibition of β-catenin/TCF/LEF signaling. Thus, this novel reporter system enabled monitoring tumorigenesis, invasiveness, metastasis, key regulatory signalings such as β-catenin/MMP9 axis, and druggability.",Transient ischemic attack: Incidence and early risk of stroke in northern Portugal from 1998-2000 to 2009-2011.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30734663,International journal of stroke : official journal of the International Stroke Society,2019 02 08,"A decline in TIA incidence would be expected mirroring stroke trends, but patient's awareness of symptoms/signs, improved diagnostic procedures and changes in severity of vascular disease may raise TIA incidence.

The effects of carrier type and substrate on biofilm structure and reactor performance have been studied. Starch was removed by adsorption at the biofilm surface and hydrolyzed which caused substrate gradient in MBBR1, however, hydrolyzed uniformly within biofilm in MBBR2. The biofilm of MBBR1 was irregular due to filamentous structure growth due to the substrate gradient, while, it was regular in MBBR2 due to uniform distribution of substrate. The performance of both MBBRs in ammonium, COD and TN removal decreased significantly when the amount of small particles in the reactor increased owing to feeding by starch, which led to biomass density decline. The type of media affected the quantity and distribution of attached biomass, which in turn influenced the activity of specific microbial functional groups in the biofilm. The biofilm in MBBR2 was thicker and consequently nitrogen removal by denitrification was much higher. The lower temperature did not affect negatively the reactor performance in MBBR2."

Part C, Methods",2019 03 19,"Patient-specific individual tissue-engineered bones (iTEBs) have been recognized as a promising strategy for treating large bone defects. However, current construction protocols of iTEBs vary between lots and lack standardization and quality control, hampering further research and application. This study was aimed to detail a standardized constructing protocol for iTEBs, which can be used for both clinical and experimental purposes. The procedure was designed and described as follows: scaffold preparation, cell isolation and culture, and fabrication of iTEBs. Manipulation and caution points in each section were detailed. A series of scales on the quality control and safety monitoring was developed. The effectiveness and safety of iTEBs were evaluated. Eventually, the preparing portion, from cell culture to scaffold treatment, usually required 21 days. Generally, the fabrication section took 5 days. The main advantage of this protocol was that each step was standardized and quality controlling and safety monitoring were performed throughout the process to ensure the homogeneity, reliability, and safety. The resulting iTEBs were effective and applicable to both clinical and experimental purposes. Thus, we have established a refined and standardized protocol detailing the construction process of patient-specific iTEBs that comply with strict quality control and safety criteria. This protocol is relatively easy for graduate students or staff working in the field of bone tissue engineering to implement.",Nexus of despair: A network analysis of suicidal ideation among veterans.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30734645,Archives of suicide research : official journal of the International Academy for Suicide Research,2019 03 25,"The objective of this study was to estimate a network model of risk and resilience factors of suicidal ideation among veterans. Two network models of suicidal ideation among Operation Iraqi Freedom/Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation New Dawn veterans (N = 276) incorporated key disorders, traumatic stress, and resilience constructs to contextualize suicidal ideation. Childhood trauma was positively connected with suicidal ideation and harassment and inversely connected with social support and distress tolerance. This exemplifies long-lasting associations between childhood trauma and re-victimization, emotion regulation, and ability to form supportive social relationships. A subsequent model including lower-order facets indicated that combat trauma was predominantly associated with posttraumatic stress disorder-intrusion symptoms. This study highlights the importance of addressing both risk and resilience to reduce suicide risk among veterans and increases understanding of factors that contribute to suicidal ideation.",Mental Health Problems and Suicide Risk: The Impact of Acute Suicidal Affective Disturbance.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30734644,Archives of suicide research : official journal of the International Academy for Suicide Research,2019 03 25,"Acute Suicidal Affective Disturbance (ASAD) is a suicide-specific, episodic clinical entity that is theorized to characterize acute suicide risk.

A total of 527 undergraduates completed an online survey. Depression, social anxiety, and alcohol problem risk (but not panic) were robustly, significantly related to suicide risk, but only social anxiety and depression were robustly related to ASAD history. Depression and social anxiety symptoms were indirectly related to suicide risk via ASAD. ASAD may serve as a potential explanatory pathway through which some mental health conditions may lead to greater suicide risk.",Matryoshka-type gastro-resistant microparticles for the oral treatment of Mycobacterium tuberculosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30734643,"Nanomedicine (London, England)",2019 04 17,Production of Matryoshka-type gastroresistant microparticles containing antibiotic-loaded poly lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) nanoparticles (NP) against Mycobacterium tuberculosis.,"""It's All about Breaking down Those Barriers…"": Exploring Survivors' Perspectives on Services and Treatment Needs following Commercial Sexual Exploitation during Childhood.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30734642,Journal of evidence-informed social work,2019 02 08,"In recent years, there has been an increase in funds and services available to address the needs of commercially sexually exploited children (CSEC).

They are classified into two families: Pospiviroidae, composed of species that have a central conserved region (CCR) and replicate in the cell nucleus, and Avsunviroidae, containing species that lack a CCR and whose multimeric replicative intermediates of either polarity generated in plastids self-cleave through hammerhead ribozymes. The compact, rod-like or branched, secondary structures of viroid RNAs have been predicted by RNA folding algorithms and further examined using different in vitro and in vivo experimental techniques. However, direct data about their native tertiary structure remain scarce.

Our results provide a direct visualization of their native, three-dimensional conformations at 0 and 4 mM Mg2+ and highlight the role that some elements of tertiary structure play in their stabilization. The AFM images show that addition of 4 mM Mg2+ to the folding buffer results in a size contraction in PSTVd and ELVd, as well as in PLMVd when the kissing-loop interaction that stabilizes its 3D structure is preserved.",Laparoscopic Total Devascularization of the Upper Stomach and Splenectomy (Hassab's Procedure) Under Indocyanine Green Fluorescence Imaging: Initial Experience.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30734640,Surgical innovation,2019 02 08,"The use of surgical treatment for refractory isolated gastric varices has decreased owing to the development of endoscopic and radiologic procedures, although surgeries are sometimes required as the final method.

LAB can heterogeneously express β-mannanase or be directly used as β-mannanase-producing strains. This research originally optimized the fermentation condition for β-mannanase produced by Lactobacillus casei HDS-01. The applicable potential of the crude enzyme in juice clarification was investigated. Two-factorial design screened out three factors, i.e., fermentation time (p = 0.0001), glucose (p = 0.0013), and initial pH (p = 0.0167), which significantly affected L. casei HDS-01 β-mannanase activity. Under the predicted conditions resulting from the central composite design (CCD), i.e., fermentation time 18.23 hr, glucose 12.65 g L-1, initial pH 5.18, the model reached maximal β-mannanase activity of 81.40 U mL-1. This model was validated by conducting six repeated experiments and subsequent t-test (p = 0.6308). RSM optimization obtained a 1.33-fold increase in β-mannanase activity. This increase could also be qualitatively detected by larger clearance zone on konjac powder-MRS agar through Congo Red dyeing. The yield and clarity of crude β-mannanase-treated juices from orange, apple, and pear were significantly higher than controls without enzyme treatment. This study conferred a relatively high β-mannanase-producing LAB strain with a high bio-safety level and easy and economical use in juice clarification as well as other food-level fields.","Soluble expression, rapid purification, biological identification of chicken interferon-alpha using a thioredoxin fusion system in E. coli and its antiviral effects to H9N2 avian influenza virus.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30734625,Preparative biochemistry & biotechnology,2019 03 21,"In this paper, we report a soluble expression based on Escherichia coli and two-step purification of a novel thioredoxin-tagged chicken interferon-α fusion protein (Trx-rChIFN-α) by using pET32a(+) expression system.

Over 40 autophagy-related (ATG) genes have been identified through forward-genetic screens in yeast. Although homology-based analyses have identified conserved ATG genes in plants, only a few atg mutants have emerged from forward-genetic screens in Arabidopsis thaliana. We developed a screen that consistently recovers Arabidopsis atg mutations by exploiting mutants with defective LON2/At5g47040, a protease implicated in peroxisomal quality control. Arabidopsis lon2 mutants exhibit reduced responsiveness to the peroxisomally-metabolized auxin precursor indole-3-butyric acid (IBA), heightened degradation of several peroxisomal matrix proteins, and impaired processing of proteins harboring N-terminal peroxisomal targeting signals; these defects are ameliorated by preventing autophagy. We optimized a lon2 suppressor screen to expedite recovery of additional atg mutants. After screening mutagenized lon2-2 seedlings for restored IBA responsiveness, we evaluated stabilization and processing of peroxisomal proteins, levels of several ATG proteins, and levels of the selective autophagy receptor NBR1/At4g24690, which accumulates when autophagy is impaired. We recovered 21 alleles disrupting 6 ATG genes: ATG2/At3g19190, ATG3/At5g61500, ATG5/At5g17290, ATG7/At5g45900, ATG16/At5g50230, and ATG18a/At3g62770. Twenty alleles were novel, and 3 of the mutated genes lack T-DNA insertional alleles in publicly available repositories. We also demonstrate that an insertional atg11/At4g30790 allele incompletely suppresses lon2 defects. Finally, we show that NBR1 is not necessary for autophagy of lon2 peroxisomes and that NBR1 overexpression is not sufficient to trigger autophagy of seedling peroxisomes, indicating that Arabidopsis can use an NBR1-independent mechanism to target peroxisomes for autophagic degradation.

All the novel compounds were tested for their anticancer activity against six tumour cell lines in vitro. Among these molecules, compounds 5b, and 5w exhibited strong cytotoxic activities with IC50 value of lower than 20 μM. Acute toxicities and antitumor efficacies of the selected compounds in mice were also evaluated, compounds 5b and 5w exhibited that tumour inhibition rate of over 40% in the Sarcoma 180 and Lewis lung cancer animal models. Preliminary structure-activity relationships (SARs) analysis indicated that: (1) C1-methylation and C7-methoxylation were favorable for increased activities; (2) 3-Pyridyl or 2-thienyl group substituent into position-1 of the β-carboline core, and the aryl substituent into another β-carboline ring might be detrimental to cytotoxic effects of this class compounds.

The new derivatives were investigated as inhibitors of four human (h) CA isoforms with pharmaceutical applications, such as the cytosolic hCA I, II and VII and the mitochondrial hCA VA. An interesting inhibitory profile against these isoforms was obtained, with some of these metal complexes acting as subnanomolar or low nanomolar inhibitors. They were also thoroughly characterised from the chemical point of view, making them of interest for further developments in the field of metal complexes of sulfonamides with CA inhibitory action.",Targeting Loxosceles spider Sphingomyelinase D with small-molecule inhibitors as a potential therapeutic approach for loxoscelism.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30734604,Journal of enzyme inhibition and medicinal chemistry,2019 03 14,"Loxosceles spiders' venoms consist of a mixture of proteins, including the sphingomyelinases D (SMases D), which are the main toxic components responsible for local and systemic effects in human envenomation. Herein, based on the structural information of SMase D from Loxosceles laeta spider venom and virtual docking-based screening approach, three benzene sulphonate compounds (named 1, 5 and 6) were identified as potential Loxosceles SMase D inhibitors. All compounds inhibited the hydrolysis of the sphingomyelin substrate by both recombinant and native SMases D. Compounds 5 and 6 acted as SMases D uncompetitive inhibitors with Ki values of 0.49 µM and 0.59 µM, respectively. Compound 1 is a mixed type inhibitor, and presented a Ki value of 0.54 µM. In addition, the three compounds inhibited the binding of SMases D to human erythrocytes and the removal of glycophorin C from the cell surface, which are important events in the complement-dependent haemolysis induced by Loxosceles venom. Moreover, compounds 5 and 6 reduced the binding of SMases to human keratinocytes membrane and the venom induced cell death. Importantly, compounds 5 and 6 also controlled the development of the necrotic lesion in an in vivo model of loxoscelism. Together, our findings indicate that the novel SMase D inhibitors presented here are able to suppress both local and systemic reactions induced by Loxosceles venoms. Since the number of Loxosceles envenomation accidents is currently growing worldwide, our results indicate that both inhibitors are promising scaffolds for the rational design of new drugs targeting SMases D from these spiders.",The chemical diversity and structure-based discovery of allosteric modulators for the PIF-pocket of protein kinase PDK1.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30734603,Journal of enzyme inhibition and medicinal chemistry,2019 03 14,"Phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1) is an important protein in mediating the PI3K-AKT pathway and is thus identified as a promising target. The catalytic activity of PDK1 is tightly regulated by allosteric modulators, which bind to the PDK1 Interacting Fragment (PIF) pocket of the kinase domain that is topographically distinct from the orthosteric, ATP binding site. Allosteric modulators by attaching to the less conserved PIF-pocket have remarkable advantages such as higher selectivity, less side effect, and lower toxicity. Targeting allosteric PIF-pocket of PDK1 has become the focus of recent attention. In this review, we summarise the current advances in the structure-based discovery of PDK1 allosteric modulators. We will first present the three-dimensional structure of PDK1 and illustrate the allosteric regulatory mechanism of PDK1 through the modulation of the PIF-pocket. Then, the recent advances of PDK1 allosteric modulators targeting the PIF-pocket will be recapitulated detailly according to the structural similarity of allosteric modulators.","Inhibition of bacterial α-, β- and γ-class carbonic anhydrases with selenazoles incorporating benzenesulfonamide moieties.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30734601,Journal of enzyme inhibition and medicinal chemistry,2019 03 14,"A series of benzenesulfonamides incorporating selenazoles with diverse substitution patterns were investigated as inhibitors of six bacterial carbonic anhydrases (CAs, EC 4.2.1.1) from bacterial pathogens, such as Helicobacter pylori (hpCAα was the investigated enzyme), Vibrio cholerae (all the three CAs from this pathogen were considered, VchCAα, VchCAβ and VchCAγ) and Burkholderia pseudomallei (with its two CAs, BpsCAβ and BpsCAγ). All these sulfonamides were effective CA inhibitors, with potencies in the low micromolar or submicromolar range, making them attractive as lead compounds for designing antibacterials with a novel mechanism of action, which could counteract the extensive resistance problem observed with many clinically used antibiotics.",Synthesis and biological evaluation of thiazole derivatives as LbSOD inhibitors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30734600,Journal of enzyme inhibition and medicinal chemistry,2019 03 14,"Leishmaniasis is considered as one of the major neglected tropical diseases due to its magnitude and wide geographic distribution.

The SS peptide is a tetrapeptide that is located and accumulated in the inner mitochondrial membrane; it reduces reactive oxygen species (ROS) and prevents mitochondrial dysfunction. Podocytes are key cellular components in DKD progression. However, whether the SS peptide can exert renal protection through podocytes and the mechanism involved are unknown. In the present study, we explored the mechanisms of the SS peptide on podocyte injury in vivo and in vitro. Compared with the control group, the glomerular podocyte number and expression of WT1 were significantly reduced and TUNEL-positive podocytes were significantly increased in renal tissues in the diabetic rat. These effects were further exacerbated by hypochlorite-modified albumin (HOCl-alb) challenge but prevented by SS-31. In vitro, SS-31 blocked apoptosis in podocyte cell line induced by HOCl-alb. SS-31 prevented oxidative stress and mitochondria-dependent apoptosis signalling by HOCl-alb in vivo and in vitro, as evidenced by the release of cytochrome c (cyt c), binding of apoptosis activated factor-1 (Apaf-1) and caspase-9, and activation of caspases. These data suggest that SS-31 may prevent podocyte apoptosis, exerting renal protection in diabetes mellitus, probably through an apoptosis-related signalling pathway involving oxidative stress and culminating in mitochondria.",A feature-based analysis identifies COL1A2 as a regulator in pancreatic cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30734598,Journal of enzyme inhibition and medicinal chemistry,2019 03 14,"This study aimed to identify genetic biomarkers in pancreatic cancer (PC) and explore its function in PC via a feature-base analysis of bioinformatics.

Molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations demonstrated the possible key interactions between the studied ligands and amino acid residues at different regions of the active sites of AChE and BuChE. Being diverse of the classical AChE and BuChE inhibitors, the investigated uracil derivatives may be used as lead molecules for designing new therapeutically effective enzyme inhibitors.",Trypsin inhibitors: promising candidate satietogenic proteins as complementary treatment for obesity and metabolic disorders?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30734596,Journal of enzyme inhibition and medicinal chemistry,2019 03 14,"The increase in non-communicable chronic diseases has aroused interest in the research of adjuvants to the classic forms of treatments.

In this context, trypsin inhibitors, molecules with wide heterologous application, appear as possibilities in the treatment of overweight and obesity due to the action on satiety related mechanisms, mainly in the modulation of satiety hormones, such as cholecystokinin. In addition, trypsin inhibitors have the ability to also act on some biochemical parameters related to these diseases, thus, emerging as potential candidates and promising molecules in the treatment of the obesity and metabolic syndrome. Thus, the present article proposes to approach, through a systematic literature review, the advantages, disadvantages and viabilities for the use of trypsin inhibitors directed to the treatment of overweight and obesity."

Hibernating myocardium is considered to be able to maintain long-term viability during chronic hypoperfusion. Pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) decreases the contractility of hypoxic cardiomyocytes and protects cardiomyocytes against ischemic injury, which is strikingly similar to the pathophysiologic characteristics of hibernating myocardium. It was therefore postulated that PEDF may induce acute ischemic myocardium into a ""hibernating-like"" state to maintain its viability. Adult Sprague-Dawley rat models of acute myocardial infarction were surgically established. Lentiviral vectors carrying the PEDF gene (PEDF-LVs) were delivered into myocardium with infarction to overexpress PEDF locally. It was found that PEDF local overexpression significantly reduced myocardial infarct size and cardiomyocytes necrosis but did not improve cardiac function at rest. The contractile reserve assessed by low-dose dobutamine stress echocardiography and ""perfusion-metabolism mismatch"" assessed by positron emission tomography, which are the characteristics of viable myocardium in hibernation, were observed in the PEDF overexpressed ischemic heart. Ultrastructural changes observed by electron microscopy and glycogen deposition explored by Periodic acid-Schiff staining were similar to the histological characteristics of hibernating myocardium. Moreover, PEDF overexpression protected the cardiomyocytes against anoxic injury and retained their functional recovery potential after reoxygenation in vitro. PEDF local overexpression may induce acute ischemic myocardium into a ""hibernating-like"" state and maintain its viability. This novel effect of PEDF presents an important clinical approach to enhance functional recovery after revascularization therapy in acute myocardial infarction.","Preclinical Assessment of Suitable Natural Killer Cell Sources for Chimeric Antigen Receptor Natural Killer-Based ""Off-the-Shelf"" Acute Myeloid Leukemia Immunotherapies.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30734584,Human gene therapy,2019 04 05,"The introduction of chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) to augment the anticancer activity of immune cells represents one of the major clinical advances in recent years. This work demonstrates that sorted CAR natural killer (NK) cells have improved antileukemia activity compared to control NK cells that lack a functional CAR. However, in terms of viability, effectiveness, risk of side effects, and clinical practicality and applicability, an important question is whether gene-modified NK cell lines represent better CAR effector cells than primary human donor CAR-NK (CAR-dNK) cells. Comparison of the functional activities of sorted CAR-NK cells generated using the NK-92 cell line with those generated from primary human dNK cells demonstrated that CAR-NK-92 cells had stronger cytotoxic activity against leukemia cells compared to CAR-dNK cells. CAR-NK-92 and CAR-dNK cells had similar CD107a surface expression upon co-incubation with leukemia cells. However, CAR-NK-92 cells secreted higher granzyme A and interleukin-17A levels, while CAR-dNK cells secreted more tumor necrosis factor alpha, interferon gamma, and granulysin. In addition, CAR-NK-92 cells revealed a significantly higher potential for adverse side effects against nonmalignant cells. In short, this work shows the feasibility for further development of CAR-NK strategies to treat leukemia.",Effect of combined neurofeedback and game-based cognitive training on the treatment of ADHD: A randomized controlled study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30734583,Applied neuropsychology.

The transfer functions is the most important component of the BDS algorithm, and converts continuous values of the donor into discrete values. In this paper, the eight types of transfer functions are investigated to verify their efficiency in improving BDS algorithm performance in QSAR classification. The performance was evaluated using three metrics: classification accuracy (CA), geometric mean of sensitivity and specificity (G-mean), and area under the curve. The Kruskal-Wallis test was also applied to show the statistical differences between the functions. Two functions, S1 and V4, show the best classification achievement, with a slightly better performance of V4 than S1. The V4 function takes the lowest iterations and selects the fewest descriptors. In addition, the V4 function yields the best CA and G-mean of 98.07% and 0.977%, respectively. The results prove that the V4 transfer function significantly improves the performance of the original BDS.",Direct quantitation of therapeutic antibodies for pharmacokinetic studies using immuno-purification and intact mass analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30734579,Bioanalysis,2019 02 08,"The quantitation of therapeutic antibodies by MS often utilizes a surrogate peptide approach.

The insulation performance of the gas mixture is closely related to the mixing ratio. Therefore, accurate quantification of C4F7N in the C4F7N-CO2 gas mixture has very important engineering significance. At present, there are few reports on the rapid quantitative detection of the concentration of C4F7N in the gas mixture. In this paper, a rapid analytical method for C4F7N concentration based on ultraviolet (UV) absorption spectroscopy is constructed. The UV spectral characteristics of C4F7N molecules are calculated by density functional theory. The appropriate bands that can be detected are determined by analyzing the calculated results. A concentration detection system of C4F7N based on UV absorption spectroscopy is built. Through analysis of the calculated results and experimental results, a quantitative detection method of C4F7N in the C4F7N/CO2 gas mixture is determined. The method can achieve accurate detection of the concentration of the gas mixture in the conventional application range (including 4-10% C4F7N).

The aim of this study was to examine rule violations as a possible quantifiable measure of executive functioning, particularly inhibitory control. In a sample of 82 veterans undergoing neuropsychological evaluation at a Virginia (VA) outpatient clinic, we recorded instances of two types of rule violations: using the incorrect hand during insertion and placing pegs out of sequence. Criterion measures included the Trail Making Test, the Tower of London, and the Stroop Color and Word Test. As hypothesized, total number of rule violations correlated moderately to strongly with the criterion measures. Notably, 60% of individuals committing two or more rule violations were impaired on at least two of the criterion measures, whereas only 17% of individuals without any rule violations were impaired on two criterion measures. Rule violations during the GPT provide valuable supplementary data for assessing executive dysfunction with no additional task demand or time cost. These data suggest that making two or more errors should raise suspicion of executive dysfunction."

For D-A molecules constructed by two identical groups, the degree of charge transfer is weaker and deep blue emission is easily achieved. Two D-A molecules (PIpPI and PImPI) were synthesized by employing diphenyl-phenanthroimidazole (PI) as a building block. The nonsymmetric connection of PI groups endows these molecules with a D-A feature that can result in a bipolar transport property.

Here, we introduce a facile strategy to fabricate novel shape-anisotropic particles with varied internal structures via self-assembly of block copolymers (BCPs), with perfluorooctane (PFO) as the liquid template in emulsion droplets. By increasing the volume ratio of PFO to polystyrene- block-poly(4-vinylpyridine) (PS- b-P4VP) or decreasing the initial concentration of the BCPs, the self-assembled polymer particles change from spherical core-shell structures to anisotropic particles. Moreover, the anisotropic shape and internal structure of the polymer particles, including cone-like particles with alternative PS and P4VP lamellas, crescent-shaped particles with cylindrical P4VP domains, and plate-like particles with spherical P4VP domains, can be obtained by changing the block ratio or molecular weight or by adding a hydrogen-bonding agent.

The electrochemical reaction of RuHex in the LAMP solution was then measured continuously via linear-sweep voltammetry at 65 °C. The LAMP reaction of the positive control revealed that the cathodic peak current of RuHex increased. Additionally, the initial number of miRNA copies was correlated with the time when the cathodic current began to increase. Five miRNAs were simultaneously detected at 103-106 copies per 50 μL within 2 h. We expect these results will be useful for developing a simple and stable electrochemical-based method for the real-time monitoring of miRNAs, while also facilitating the implementation of electrochemical DNA chips for molecular analyses.",Overexpression of Monacolin K Biosynthesis Genes in the Monascus purpureus Azaphilone Polyketide Pathway.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30734557,Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,2019 03 18,"Monascus purpureus is an important food and drug microbial resource through the production of a variety of secondary metabolites, including monacolin K, a well-recognized cholesterol-lowering agent. However, the high production costs and naturally low contents of monacolin K have restricted its large-scale production. Thus, in this study we sought to improve the production of monacolin K in M. purpureus through overexpression of four genes ( mokC, mokD, mokE, and mokI). Four overexpression strains were successfully constructed by protoplast electric shock conversion, which resulted in a 234.3%, 220.8%, 89.5%, and 10% increase in the yield of monacolin K, respectively. The overexpression strains showed clear changes to the mycelium surface with obvious folds and the spores with depressions, whereas the pBC5 mycelium had a fuller structure with a flatter surface. Further investigation of these strains can provide the theoretical basis and technical support for the development of functional Monascus varieties.","Effect of Secondary Metabolites of Tomato ( Solanum lycopersicum) on Chemotaxis of Ralstonia solanacearum, Pathogen of Bacterial Wilt Disease.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30734556,Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,2019 03 04,"The chemotactic activity of the pathogen of bacterial wilt disease, Ralstonia solanacearum, was tested against 30 aromatic acids and plant hormones infused on filter discs in bioassays on agar plates. 4-Hydroxycinnamic acid ( p-coumaric acid) and 4-hydroxybenzoic acid were strong chemoattractants, 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid (protocatechuic acid) and jasmonic acid were weak attractants, and 2-hydroxybenzoic acid (salicylic acid) showed both attracting and repelling activity depending on dose. Examination of the dose dependency revealed that the ED50 for 4-hydroxycinnamic acid and 4-hydroxybenzoic acid was 0.08 and 0.39 μmol/disc, respectively. 2-Hydroxybenzoic acid showed chemoattractant activity at 0.33 μmol/disc but chemorepellent activity at 3.3 μmol/disc, and bacterial random motility was activated at 1.0 μmol/disc and bacterial activity was suppressed at 33 μmol/disc.

The symmetries of their hydrogen bonds were probed by isotopic perturbation of their 13CO NMR signals. The former mixture shows a total of four signals, due to both intrinsic and perturbation isotope shifts. Therefore, that enol is a mixture of tautomers with an asymmetric hydrogen bond. In contrast, the mixture of isotopologues of nitromalonamide enol shows only two signals, due to an intrinsic isotope shift.

Using radiation with photon energy greater than the ionization potential of the adsorbed molecules, photoelectrons were collected that originated from both underlying ferromagnetic substrates and the organic films, with kinetic energies in the range of ca. 0-18 eV. We investigated chiral organic films composed of self-assembled monolayers of α-helical peptides and electrostatically adsorbed films of the protein, bovine serum albumin, with different α-helix and β-sheet contents. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectral widths were found to depend on substrate magnetization orientation and polarization, which we attribute to helicity-dependent molecular ionization cross sections arising from photoelectron impact, possibly resulting in spin-polarized holes. These interactions between spin-polarized photoelectrons and chiral molecules are physically manifested as differences in the measured photoionization energies of the chiral molecular films. Substrate magnetization-dependent ionization energies and work function values were deconvoluted using surface charge neutralization techniques, permitting the measurement of relative spin-dependent energy barriers to transmission through chiral organic films.",Golgi Apparatus Polarity Indicates Depression-Like Behaviors of Mice Using in Vivo Fluorescence Imaging.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30734552,Analytical chemistry,2019 03 05,"Depression is associated with decreased expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) which assembled in Golgi apparatus. The changes might be closely related to variation in Golgi apparatus polarity. Thus, developing a nondestructive method to detect polarity in living cells and in vivo can facilitate accurate diagnosis and prognosis of depression. Herein, we created a new near-infrared Golgi-targetable fluorescent probe (Golgi-P) in which the merocyanine and benzoyl difluoroboronate moieties sense polarity changes. Golgi-P exhibited a decrease in fluorescence intensity and red-shift of maximum emission wavelength as the increase in polarity. Using Golgi-P, we discovered distinctly higher polarity in brains of mice with depression phenotype for the first time. Furthermore, our results disclosed that the elevation of polarity could due to the reduced synthesis of BDNF. Altogether, this study offers a new strategy for the accurate diagnosis of depression."

Whereas work on syntactic bootstrapping depends on learners retaining information about the set of distributional contexts that a word occurs in, work on identifying a word's referent suggests that learners do not retain information about the set of extralinguistic contexts that a word occurs in. I argue that this asymmetry derives from the architecture of the language faculty. Learners expect words with similar meanings to have similar distributions, and so learning depends on a memory for syntactic environments. The referential context in which a word is used is less constrained and hence contributes less to the memories that drive word learning.","Strength and Motion in the Shoulder, Elbow, and Hip in Softball Windmill Pitchers.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30734537,"PM & R : the journal of injury, function, and rehabilitation",2019 05 01,"Softball pitching is a ballistic, complex movement that requires an underhand windmill motion to create force and ball velocity.

Nevertheless, there is no efficient therapeutic method to avoid IUA. Bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) are an important cell source for tissue regeneration. This study designs and explores the ability of BMSC-loaded elastic poly(glycerol sebacate) (PGS) scaffold to prevent IUA and compares the effect of PGS with poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) and collagen scaffolds in resumption of damaged rat uteruses. The 3D architecture provided by PGS scaffolds favors the attachment and growth of rat BMSCs. In vivo bioluminescence imaging shows that compared with direct BMSC intrauterine injection, PLGA, and collagen scaffolds, the PGS scaffold significantly prolongs the retention time of BMSCs in a wounded rat uterus model. More importantly, BMSCs can directly differentiate into endometrial stromal cells after transplantation of PGS/BMSCs constructs, but not PLGA/BMSCs and collagen/BMSCs. It is found that the level of transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), vascular endothelial growth factor, and insulin-like growth factors in the injured endometrium adjacent to PGS/BMSCs constructs is higher than those of rats receiving PLGA/BMSCs, collagen/BMSCs, or BMSCs intrauterine transplantation. Besides, transplantation of PGS/BMSCs leads to better morphology recovery of the damaged uterus than PLGA/BMSCs and collagen/BMSCs. The receptive fertility of PGS/BMSCs is 72.2 ± 6.4%, similar to the one of collagen/BMSCs, but significantly higher than 42.3 ± 3.9% in PLGA/BMSCs. Taken together, PGS/BMSCs may be a promising candidate for preventing IUA.","Identification of three new HLA alleles in the Spanish population: HLA-C*05:203, C*15:10:04 and DRB1*01:99.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30734534,HLA,2019 03 26,"Three new HLA alleles, HLA-C*05:203, -C*15:10:04 and DRB1*01:99, were characterized in the Spanish population.",Skeletal muscle oxygenation during cycling at different power output and cadence.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30734533,Physiological reports,2019 02 19,"The selection of cadence during cycling may be determined by a number of factors, including the degree of oxygenation in the exercising skeletal muscle. The purpose of this study was to determine the degree of muscle oxygenation associated with different cycling cadences and exercise intensities, and its putative role in the choice of self-selected cadence during cycling. We recorded cardiopulmonary and metabolic responses to cycling at exercise intensities of 70% and 90% of the ventilatory threshold (Tvent ), and used near-infrared spectroscopy to determine tissue saturation index as a measure of skeletal muscle (vastus lateralis) oxygenation. Twelve participants cycled at cadences of 30, 50, 70, 90, and 110 revolutions per minute (rpm), each for 4 min, in a randomized sequence, interspersed with active recovery periods. Despite cardiopulmonary and metabolic responses being greater at 90% than at 70% Tvent , and at 110 rpm compared with lower cadences, vastus lateralis oxygenation was not different between the two exercise intensities and five cadences tested. Our results indicate that skeletal muscle tissue saturation index is not substantially affected during cycling for short periods of time at constant, moderate exercise intensity at cadences between 30 and 110 rpm, suggesting that skeletal muscle oxygenation may not be an important negative feedback signal in the choice of self-selected cadence during cycling at moderate exercise intensity.",Advancing Frontiers in Bone Bioprinting.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30734530,Advanced healthcare materials,2019 04 10,"Three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting of cell-laden biomaterials is used to fabricate constructs that can mimic the structure of native tissues.

In this review, a critical overview of the recent literature on various types of bioinks used for bone bioprinting is presented. Major challenges, such as the vascularity, clinically relevant size, and mechanical properties of 3D printed structures, that need to be addressed to successfully use the technology in clinical settings, are discussed.

The poor efficacy has been partially attributed to the lack of understanding in how CAR-T cells function in a solid tumor microenvironment. Hypoxia plays a critical role in cancer progression and immune editing, which potentially results in solid tumors escaping immunosurveillance and CAR-T cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Mechanistic studies of CAR-T cell biology in a physiological environment has been limited by the complexity of tumor-immune interactions in clinical and animal models, as well as by a lack of reliable in vitro models. A microdevice platform that recapitulates a 3D tumor section with a gradient of oxygen and integrates fluidic channels surrounding the tumor for CAR-T cell delivery is engineered. The design allows for the evaluation of CAR-T cell cytotoxicity and infiltration in the heterogeneous oxygen landscape of in vivo solid tumors at a previously unachievable scale in vitro.",A Small-Molecule SIRT2 Inhibitor That Promotes K-Ras4a Lysine Fatty-Acylation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30734528,ChemMedChem,2019 04 09,"SIRT2, a member of the sirtuin family of protein lysine deacylases, has been identified as a promising therapeutic target for treating cancer. In addition to catalyzing deacetylation, SIRT2 has recently been shown to remove fatty acyl groups from K-Ras4a and promote its transforming activity. Among the SIRT2-specific inhibitors, only the thiomyristoyl lysine compound TM can weakly inhibit the demyristoylation activity of SIRT2. Therefore, more potent small-molecule SIRT2 inhibitors are needed to further evaluate the therapeutic potential of SIRT2 inhibition, and to understand the function of protein lysine defatty-acylation. Herein we report a SIRT2 inhibitor, JH-T4, which can increase K-Ras4a lysine fatty acylation. This is the first small-molecule inhibitor that can modulate the lysine fatty acylation levels of K-Ras4a. JH-T4 also inhibits SIRT1 and SIRT3 in vitro. The increased potency of JH-T4 is likely due to the formation of hydrogen bonding between the hydroxy group and SIRT1, SIRT2, and SIRT3. This is further supported by in vitro studies with another small-molecule inhibitor, NH-TM. These studies provide useful insight for future SIRT2 inhibitor development.",Midline carcinoma expressing NUT in malignant effusion cytology.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30734527,Diagnostic cytopathology,2019 05 14,"Nuclear protein in testis (NUT) midline carcinoma (NMC) is a rare and aggressive subset of poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma that is defined by t(15,19) and typically presents in the midline structures of the head, neck, and mediastinum. We report two cases of NMC that presented uniquely with malignant pleural and pericardial effusions including one with cardiac tamponade at presentation. The first case is of a 25-year-old male patient who presented with progressive dyspnea associated with palpitations and dizziness on standing, found to have large bilateral pleural effusions. The second case is of a previously healthy 29-year-old male patient who presented with progressive dyspnea, cough with expectoration, and a large right lower neck mass of 3 months onset, and a large left pleural effusion and left lung infiltrate on imaging studies. Both cases showed malignant cells on cytology suggestive of poorly differentiated carcinoma. Subsequent histopathological and immunochemistry studies were consistent with the diagnosis of NMC. Both patients had a rapid decline in status and suffered comorbidities secondary to their carcinoma, inevitably leading to their death. It is important to consider NUT midline carcinomas can present in a variety of clinical scenarios, and it is important to consider in the differential diagnoses when evaluating malignant effusion cytology. Utilization of ancillary testing with a broad immunostain profile including NUT studies, as well as fluorescent in-situ hydridization (FISH) studies are helpful and necessary in making the appropriate diagnosis."

SP48 on harmful algal blooms caused by Alexandrium tamarense.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30734515,MicrobiologyOpen,2019 02 08,"Bacteria play an important role in preventing algal blooms and reducing their harm to the environment. To improve the algicidal activity of Pseudoalteromonas SP48 which had an inhibition effect on dinoflagellate Alexandrium tamarense, its growth medium and fermentation conditions were optimized for this bacterium. In this study, we used two steps to establish the optimum conditions. First, the proper proportion of medium was selected based on an orthogonal design. Then, the fermentation conditions were further optimized through uniform design in an enlarged 5L bioreactor. To test the algicidal ability of Pseudoalteromonas SP48 under the optimum conditions, algal cell morphology was observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). After the orthogonal design, we found that the optimum medium was [0.7% (m/v) tryptone, 0.2% (m/v) soluble starch, 0.2% (m/v) sucrose, 0.1% (m/v) FeSO4 , and 1.2% (m/v) K2 HPO4 ] for Pseudoalteromonas SP48 growth. Based on these results, optimum fermentation conditions were further explored in a 5L fermentation cylinder using a uniform design; the influence of variables such as incubation time, carbon type, and rotation speed were tested. The optimal fermentation conditions were fermentation time (42 hr), tryptone (1.1%), seeding volume (1.4 × 1013  cells), and rotation speed (250 r/min). Under these established optimum conditions, the biomass of strain SP48 increased by 79.2% and its lethal dose 50% (LD50 ) decreased by 54.0%, respectively. The TEM results showed that compared with the control group, the cell wall and cell membrane of A. tamarense were significantly damaged, and the structure and shape of the organelles were destroyed by algicidal bacteria of Pseudoalteromonas SP48. Overall, our results demonstrate that the optimized culture conditions could significantly enhance the algicidal activity of Pseudoalteromonas SP48 against a harmful dinoflagellate, such as A. tamarense. It will effectively provide a scientific foundation for both production of algicidal substances and HABs control.","A framework for reviewing livestock disease reporting systems in high-risk areas: assessing performance and perceptions towards foot and mouth disease reporting in the Thrace region of Greece, Bulgaria and Turkey.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30734513,Transboundary and emerging diseases,2019 05 20,"Disease reporting is an essential frontline component of surveillance systems, particularly for detecting incursions of new and emerging diseases. It has the advantages of being comprehensive and continuous, with the potential to reduce the time of disease detection and the extent of consequent spread. A number of exotic diseases, including sheep and goat pox, lumpy skin disease, peste des petits ruminants and foot and mouth disease have historically entered into south-eastern Europe through the Thrace region, which extends across neighbouring areas of Greece, Bulgaria and Turkey. In this high-risk area, multiple factors can reduce the sensitivity of disease reporting across the diverse production systems and animal health services need robust and effective disease reporting systems. While describing a training exercise designed to provide animal health services of the three countries with the knowledge and skills for conducting comprehensive in-country assessments, we provide an initial evaluation of the sensitivity of foot and mouth disease reporting and identify gaps and constraints in the Thrace region. An expert elicitation approach was used to consult official veterinarians from central and local animal health authorities of the three countries, and scenario trees modelling was applied to analyse the collected data. The reported sensitivity of disease reporting often varied between the central and local veterinary authorities within the three countries. Awareness of clinical disease, of reporting procedures and of biosecurity measures affected the early stages of disease reporting, particularly in the production systems identified at lower reporting sensitivity such as small ruminant's herds, mixed bovine herds and backyard herds. Despite its limitations this training exercise provided an effective framework (a) to develop capacities of the veterinary services in the region and (b) to supply initial evidence for guiding further interventions targeting those sectors and stakeholders at lower reporting sensitivity to reduce risks of disease introduction.",Comparative analysis of the main active components and hypoglycemic effects after the compatibility of Scutellariae Radix and Coptidis Rhizoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30734512,Journal of separation science,2019 04 17,"In this study, a rapid and highly sensitive ultra high performance liquid chromatography with triple quadrupole mass spectrometry method with the mobile phase of acetonitrile and 0.1% aqueous formic acid was established and successfully applied to comparatively analyze main active components after their compatibility.

Recent studies have noted the presence of inflammatory molecules generated during MP. We hypothesized that there is a metabolism-dependent accumulation of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and inflammatory cytokines during MP and that these molecules provoke inflammation in the graft. To stratify groups by metabolic rate, MP was performed on rat livers from standard donors at 3 different temperatures: room temperature (RT), subnormothermic (30°C), and normothermic (37°C). Static cold storage at 4°C was included as a reference group. Following a 4-hour preservation period, graft reperfusion was performed ex vivo at 37°C (n = 6 for all groups). Levels of DAMPs and inflammatory cytokines were measured, and their biological activity was assessed by determining toll-like receptor (TLR) stimulation, inflammatory gene expression, and activation of cell death pathways. There was a time-dependent increase in levels of DAMPs during MP with high-mobility group box 1 and extracellular DNA levels increasing for all groups (P < 0.05, 30 versus 240 minutes). Tumor necrosis factor α levels in the perfusate also increased during MP for all groups (P < 0.05, 30 minutes versus 240 minutes). Levels of inflammatory molecules correlated with increased activation of TLRs (TLR3, P = 0.02, normothermic machine preservation [MP37] versus machine preservation at room temperature [MPRT]; TLR9, P = 0.02, MP37 versus MPRT). Priming of the NLRP3 inflammasome and activation of cell death pathways were reduced in grafts preserved by MP at room temperature. In conclusion, inflammatory molecules produced during MP have a biological impact on the graft. Therapies to attenuate DAMP-mediated inflammation during MP may further enhance this promising technology.",C-reactive protein to albumin ratio is a key indicator in a predictive model for anastomosis leakage after esophagectomy: Application of classification and regression tree analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30734487,Thoracic cancer,2019 04 16,"Anastomotic leakage (AL), a serious complication after esophagectomy, might impair patient quality of life, prolong hospital stay, and even lead to surgery-related death.

However, many longitudinal studies have identified insomnia as an independent risk factor for the development of emerging or recurrent depression among young, middle-aged and older adults. This bidirectional association between sleep disturbance and depression has created a new perspective that sleep problems are no longer an epiphenomenon of depression but a predictive prodromal symptom. In this review, we highlight the treatment of sleep disturbance before, during and after depression, which probably plays an important role in improving outcomes and preventing the recurrence of depression. In clinical practice, pharmacological therapies, including hypnotics and antidepressants, and non-pharmacological therapies are typically applied. A better understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms between sleep disturbance and depression can help psychiatrists better manage this comorbidity.",Alteration in gene expression profile of thymomas with or without myasthenia gravis linked with the nuclear factor-kappaB/autoimmune regulator pathway to myasthenia gravis pathogenesis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30734484,Thoracic cancer,2019 03 05,To investigate the gene expression profile of a set of candidate genes for a better understanding of the molecular mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of thymoma with or without myasthenia gravis.,DNA-Mediated Self-Assembly of Plasmonic Antennas with a Single Quantum Dot in the Hot Spot.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30734483,"Small (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)",2019 02 08,"DNA self-assembly is a powerful tool to arrange optically active components with high accuracy in a large parallel manner. A facile approach to assemble plasmonic antennas consisting of two metallic nanoparticles (40 nm) with a single colloidal quantum dot positioned at the hot spot is presented here. The design approach is based on DNA complementarity, stoichiometry, and steric hindrance principles. Since no intermediate molecules other than short DNA strands are required, the structures possess a very small gap (≈ 5 nm) which is desired to achieve high Purcell factors and plasmonic enhancement. As a proof-of-concept, the fluorescence emission from antennas assembled with both conventional and ultrasmooth spherical gold particles is measured. An increase in fluorescence is obtained, up to ≈30-fold, compared to quantum dots without antenna.",Application of magnetized MOF-74 to phthalate esters extraction from Chinese liquor.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30734482,Journal of separation science,2019 04 17,"In this study, magnetized MOF-74 (Ni) was prepared using an ultrasound-assisted synthesis method. This novel functional magnetic adsorbent was characterized using various techniques. Using the prepared material as adsorbents, a magnetic solid-phase extraction method coupled with high-performance liquid chromatography was proposed for determining four phthalate esters in Chinese liquor samples. The extraction parameters, including solution pH, adsorbent amount, extraction time, and eluent type and volume, were optimized. Under the optimized conditions, proposed method showed good linearity within the range of 1.53-200 μg/L for diphenyl phthalate, 2.03-200 μg/L for butyl benzyl phthalate, 7.02-200 μg/L for diamyl phthalate, and 6.03-200 μg/L for dicyclohexyl phthalate, with correlation coefficients > 0.9944, low limits of detection (0.46-2.10 μg/L, S/N = 3), and good extraction repeatability (relative standard deviations of 3.7%, n = 6). This method was successfully used to analyze phthalate esters in Chinese liquor samples with recoveries of 74.4-104.8%. Two phthalate esters were detected in two samples, both at concentrations that satisfied the Chinese national standard, indicating this method has practical application prospects. The extraction efficiency of this method was also compared with conventional solid-phase extraction using commercial C18 cartridges. The results demonstrated that the proposed magnetic solid-phase extraction is a simple, time-saving, efficient, and low-cost method.","Microbial assemblage and palaeoenvironmental reconstruction of the 1.38 Ga Velkerri Formation, McArthur Basin, northern Australia.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30734481,Geobiology,2019 02 08,"The ca. 1.38 billion years (Ga) old Roper Group of the McArthur Basin, northern Australia, is one of the most extensive Proterozoic hydrocarbon-bearing units. Organic-rich black siltstones from the Velkerri Formation were deposited in a deep-water sequence and were analysed to determine their organic geochemical (biomarker) signatures, which were used to interpret the microbial diversity and palaeoenvironment of the Roper Seaway. The indigenous hydrocarbon biomarker assemblages describe a water column dominated by bacteria with large-scale heterotrophic reworking of the organic matter in the water column or bottom sediment. Possible evidence for microbial reworking includes a large unresolved complex mixture (UCM), high ratios of mid-chained and terminally branched monomethyl alkanes relative to n-alkanes-features characteristic of indigenous Proterozoic bitumen. Steranes, biomarkers for single-celled and multicellular eukaryotes, were below detection limits in all extracts analysed, despite eukaryotic microfossils having been previously identified in the Roper Group, albeit largely in organically lean shallower water facies. These data suggest that eukaryotes, while present in the Roper Seaway, were ecologically restricted and contributed little to export production. The 2,3,4- and 2,3,6-trimethyl aryl isoprenoids (TMAI) were absent or in very low concentration in the Velkerri Formation. The low abundance is primary and not caused by thermal destruction. The combination of increased dibenzothiophene in the Amungee Member of the Velkerri Formation and trace metal redox geochemistry suggests that degradation of carotenoids occurred during intermittent oxygen exposure at the sediment-water interface and/or the water column was rarely euxinic in the photic zone and likely only transiently euxinic at depth. A comparison of this work with recently published biomarker and trace elemental studies from other mid-Proterozoic basins demonstrates that microbial environments, water column geochemistry and basin redox were heterogeneous."

As an ECL luminophore, Ru(bpy)32+ molecules are doped into silica nanoparticles. The stochastic collision events of Ru(bpy)32+ -doped silica nanoparticles (RuSNPs) can be tracked by observing the ECL 'blips' from the ECL reaction of Ru(bpy)32+ with a coreactant in solution. When RuSNPs collided with UME, Ru(bpy)32+ molecules that only exist near the collision site of silica nanoparticles (NPs) were electrochemically oxidized to form Ru(bpy)33+ , and then emitted light, because silica NPs are insulated. The inhomogeneous properties of silica nanoparticle surfaces will produce diverse ECL blips in intensity and shape. In addition, distribution gradients from the he Ru(bpy)32+ in a silica matrix also affect ECL blips. Some information on the surface properties of silica NPs can be obtained by observation of single silica collision events.",Histone deacetylase inhibitor LMK235 attenuates vascular constriction and aortic remodelling in hypertension.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30734467,Journal of cellular and molecular medicine,2019 04 09,"Here, we report that LMK235, a class I and histone deacetylase (HDAC6)-preferential HDAC inhibitor, reduces hypertension via inhibition of vascular contraction and vessel hypertrophy. Angiotensin II-infusion mice and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) were used to test the anti-hypertensive effect of LMK235. Daily injection of LMK235 lowered angiotensin II-induced systolic blood pressure (BP). A reduction in systolic BP in SHRs was observed on the second day when SHRs were treated with 3 mg/kg LMK235 every 3 days. However, LMK235 treatment did not affect angiotensin-converting enzyme 1 and angiotensin II receptor mRNA expression in either hypertensive model. LMK235, acting via the nitric oxide pathway, facilitated the relaxing of vascular contractions induced by a thromboxane A2 agonist in the rat aortic and mesenteric artery ring test. In addition, LMK235 increased nitric oxide production in HUVECs and inhibited the increasing of aortic wall thickness in both animal hypertensive models. LMK235 decreased the enhanced cell cycle-related genes cyclin D1 and E2F3 in angiotensin II-infusion mice and restored the decreased p21 expression. In addition, LMK235 suppressed calcium calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) α, which is related to vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation. Inhibition or knockdown of HDAC5 blocked the CaMKIIα-induced cell cycle gene expression. Immunoprecipitation demonstrated that class I HDACs were involved in the inhibition of CaMKII α-induced HDAC4/5 by LMK235. We suggest that LMK235 should be further investigated for its use in the development of new therapeutic options to treat hypertension via reducing vascular hyperplasia or vasoconstriction.",Delayed Blood Processing Leads to Rapid Deterioration in the Measurement of the Neutrophil Respiratory Burst by the Dihydrorhodamine-123 Reduction Assay.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30734466,"Cytometry.

There is a disparity in evidence for decay rates in measurements and recommended time-frames for assaying neutrophil parameters in particular assays following blood collection. We, therefore, evaluated the decline in the neutrophil respiratory burst, typically screened for assessing congenital NADPH oxidase defects, over a shorter time-course than previously published experiments.",Circulating RNAs as predictive markers for the progression of type 2 diabetes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30734465,Journal of cellular and molecular medicine,2019 04 10,"Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) is the most prevalent form of diabetes in the USA, thus, the identification of biomarkers that could be used to predict the progression from prediabetes to T2DM would be greatly beneficial. Recently, circulating RNA including microRNAs (miRNAs) present in various body fluids have emerged as potential biomarkers for various health conditions, including T2DM. Whereas studies that examine the changes of miRNA spectra between healthy controls and T2DM individuals have been reported, the goal of this study is to conduct a baseline comparison of prediabetic individuals who either progress to T2DM, or remain prediabetic. Using an advanced small RNA sequencing library construction method that improves the detection of miRNA species, we identified 57 miRNAs that showed significant concentration differences between progressors (progress from prediabetes to T2DM) and non-progressors. Among them, 26 have been previously reported to be associated with T2DM in either body fluids or tissue samples. Some of the miRNAs identified were also affected by obesity. Furthermore, we identified miRNA panels that are able to discriminate progressors from non-progressors. These results suggest that upon further validation these miRNAs may be useful to predict the risk of conversion to T2DM from prediabetes.",Osteoporosis is inversely associated with arterial stiffness in the elderly: An investigation using the Osteoporosis Self-assessment Tool for Asians index in an elderly Chinese cohort.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30734463,"Journal of clinical hypertension (Greenwich, Conn.)",2019 03 15,"Although the association of arterial stiffness and osteoporosis has been reported, the relation of arterial stiffness with risk of osteoporosis and bone fracture is not established. The authors investigated the correlation between arterial stiffness (brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity [baPWV]), including a cutoff value, and risk of osteoporosis as assessed by the Osteoporosis Self-assessment Tool for Asia (OSTA) index in 129 elderly Chinese community-dwelling individuals (age 83.2 ± 12.8 years, 63 females). OSTA was negatively correlated with baPWV (r = -0.326, P = 0.023) after adjusting for confounding factors such as gender, body mass index, low-density lipoprotein, triglycerides, estimated glomerular filtration rate, absence or presence of diabetes, absence or presence of hypertension, and uric acid. baPWV was an independent factor for changes in OSTA (β = -0.001, P = 0.002). ROC curve analysis confirmed association between baPWV and OSTA index (AUC = 0.742 [CI: 0.660, 0.824]; P < 0.001) with a baPWV cutoff value of 1676 cm/s (sensitivity, 80.7%; specificity, 60%) for prediction of high OSTA index. The study showed a significant correlation between OSTA index and baPWV, suggesting a potential predictive value of baPWV in elderly patient at high risk of osteoporosis.",The OsmiR396-OsGRF8-OsF3H-flavonoid pathway mediates resistance to the brown planthopper in rice (Oryza sativa).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30734457,Plant biotechnology journal,2019 03 14,"Multi-functional microRNAs (miRNAs) are emerging as key modulators of plant-pathogen interactions. Although the involvement of some miRNAs in plant-insect interactions has been revealed, the underlying mechanisms are still elusive. The brown planthopper (BPH) is the most notorious rice (Oryza sativa)-specific insect that causes severe yield losses each year and requires urgent biological control. To reveal the miRNAs involved in rice-BPH interactions, we performed miRNA sequencing and identified BPH-responsive OsmiR396. Sequestering OsmiR396 by overexpressing target mimicry (MIM396) in three genetic backgrounds indicated that OsmiR396 negatively regulated BPH resistance. Overexpression of one BPH-responsive target gene of OsmiR396, growth regulating factor 8 (OsGRF8), showed resistance to BPH. Furthermore, the flavonoid contents increased in both the OsmiR396-sequestered and the OsGRF8 overexpressing plants. By analysing 39 natural rice varieties, the elevated flavonoid contents were found to correlate with enhanced BPH resistance. Artificial applications of flavonoids to wild type (WT) plants also increased resistance to BPH. A BPH-responsive flavanone 3-hydroxylase (OsF3H) gene in the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway was proved to be directly regulated by OsGRF8. A genetic functional analysis of OsF3H revealed its positive role in mediating both the flavonoid contents and BPH resistance. And analysis of the genetic correlation between OsmiR396 and OsF3H showed that down-regulation of OsF3H complemented the BPH resistance characteristic and simultaneously decreased the flavonoid contents of the MIM396 plants. Thus, we revealed a new BPH resistance mechanism mediated by the OsmiR396-OsGRF8-OsF3H-flavonoid pathway. Our study suggests potential applications of miRNAs in BPH resistance breeding.",Glutamatergic neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex mediate the formation and retrieval of cocaine-associated memories in mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30734456,Addiction biology,2019 02 08,"In drug addiction, environmental stimuli previously associated with cocaine use readily elicit cocaine-associated memories, which persist long after abstinence and trigger cocaine craving and consumption. Although previous studies suggest that the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is involved in the expression of cocaine-addictive behaviors, it remains unclear whether excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the mPFC are causally related to the formation and retrieval of cocaine-associated memories. To address this issue, we used the designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADD) technology combined with a cocaine-induced conditioned place preference (CPP) paradigm. We suppressed mPFC neuronal activity in a cell-type- and timing-dependent manner. C57BL/6J wild-type mice received bilateral intra-mPFC infusion of an adeno-associated virus (AAV) expressing inhibitory DREADD (hM4Di) under the control of CaMKII promotor to selectively suppress mPFC pyramidal neurons. GAD67-Cre mice received bilateral intra-mPFC infusion of a Cre-dependent AAV expressing hM4Di to specifically silence GABAergic neurons. Chemogenetic suppression of mPFC pyramidal neurons significantly attenuated both the acquisition and expression of cocaine CPP, while suppression of mPFC GABAergic neurons affected neither the acquisition nor expression of cocaine CPP. Moreover, chemogenetic inhibition of mPFC glutamatergic neurons did not affect the acquisition and expression of lithium chloride-induced conditioned place aversion. These results suggest that the activation of glutamatergic, but not GABAergic, neurons in the mPFC mediates both the formation and retrieval of cocaine-associated memories.",Communication about prognosis and end-of-life in pediatric organ failure and transplantation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30734455,Pediatric transplantation,2019 02 08,"Despite advancements in treatment and survival, pediatric organ failure and transplant populations continue to face significant risks of morbidity and mortality.

Limitations in patient anatomy or a short donor renal vein may necessitate intraoperative inversion of the kidney. There is little evidence to support the use of this surgical technique, and no evidence in the pediatric population. This study identifies the perioperative and post-operative outcomes of inverted renal transplants in pediatric patients. We reviewed all patients having a renal transplant between January 2012 and December 2016 and collected short- and long-term outcomes of patients who received an inverted allograft. Early graft function was defined as the time to reach creatinine nadir. During this time, our hospital performed 81 transplants, and 50 (62%) were from deceased donors, including the 6 (12%) patients who received inverted renal grafts. Half (3/6) were female, 5/6 (83%) were dialysis-dependent, and the median age at surgery was 13 years (range 9-16 years). There was no significant difference in mean creatinine nadir values (P = 0.518) and the time to creatinine nadir mean values (P = 0.190) between the upright and inverted renal transplant groups. There were also no significant differences in rates of post-operative complications between the upright and inverted allograft recipients. Inversion of renal allografts in pediatric patients is a viable surgical technique to compensate for shortcomings in patient anatomy or in special cases of renal transplantation involving a short donor renal vein. Future research should focus on outcomes of a larger group of pediatric inverted renal transplant patients.",Stacking-Layer-Number Dependence of Water Adsorption in 3D Ordered Close-Packed g-C3 N4 Nanosphere Arrays for Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30734453,Angewandte Chemie (International ed. in English),2019 03 19,"Water adsorption capacity is a key factor to influence the photocatalytic H2 evolution activity of polymeric g-C3 N4  .

To prioritize candidates for follow-up investigation, we also sought to translate gene expression findings across species. Using data from the largest genome-wide association study (GWAS) of CD to date (n = 3176, 74% with CD), we assessed genomic heritability, gene-based associations, and tissue enrichment. We detected a significant single-nucleotide polymorphism heritability of 28% for CD and identified three genes (two loci) underlying this predisposition: the C1qL2 (complement component C1 q like 2), KCTD20 (potassium channel tetramerization domain containing 20), and STK38 (serine/threonine kinase 38) genes. Tissue enrichment analyses indicated robust enrichment in numerous brain regions, including the hippocampus. We used postmortem human hippocampal RNA-sequencing data from previous study (n = 15, seven chronic cocaine users) to follow up genome-wide results and to identify differentially expressed genes/transcripts and gene networks underlying cocaine use. Cross-species analyses utilized hippocampal gene expression from a mouse model of cocaine use. Differentially expressed genes/transcripts in humans were enriched for the genes nominally associated with CD via GWAS (P < 0.05) and for differentially expressed genes in the hippocampus of cocaine-exposed mice. We identified KCTD20 as a central component of a hippocampal gene network strongly associated with human cocaine use, and this gene network was conserved in the mouse hippocampus. We outline a framework to map and translate genome-wide findings onto tissue-specific gene expression, which provided biological insight into cocaine use/dependence.","Immunogenicity and side-effects of the inactivated hepatitis A vaccine in periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, and adenitis patients.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30734430,Pediatrics international : official journal of the Japan Pediatric Society,2019 02 22,"The aim of this study was to compare the immunogenicity and side-effects of hepatitis A virus (HAV) vaccination between periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, and adenitis (PFAPA) patients and healthy controls who have not been previously exposed to HAV.

Immunogenicity was expressed as seroconversion and seroprotection rates; mean HAV-immunoglobulin G concentration was measured at 0, 1, 7 and 18 months. Side-effects were defined as incidence of adverse events and the effect of vaccination on PFAPA symptoms. All participants were seronegative and seroconverted at 1 month. One month after primary vaccination, 92.9% of PFAPA patients and 77.6% of the controls attained seroprotection, while the rates increased to 100% and 96.1%, respectively, 1 month after the second dose. Seroprotection rates remained adequate 1 year after completion of vaccination.

The aim of the study was to assess the possibility of reducing the number of ST in children when performing a complete allergy workup for BL hypersensitivity reactions."
