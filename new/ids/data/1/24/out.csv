However, racial and gender disparities in HIV care receipt exist. Discrimination and its impact may vary by race/ethnicity and gender, contributing to disparities. Data from 1578 women in the Women's Interagency HIV Study ascertained from 10/1/2012 to 9/30/2016 were used to: (1) estimate the relationship between discrimination and missing any scheduled HIV care appointments and (2) assess whether this relationship is effect measure modified by race/ethnicity. Self-reported measures captured discrimination and the primary outcome of missing any HIV care appointments in the last 6 months. Log-binomial models accounting for measured sources of confounding and selection bias were fit. For the primary outcome analyses, women experiencing discrimination typically had a higher prevalence of missing an HIV care appointment. Moreover, there was no statistically significant evidence for effect measure modification by race/ethnicity. Interventions to minimize discrimination or its impact may improve HIV care engagement among women.",Suicidal Ideation Among Adults Re-engaging in HIV Care in Argentina.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31049810,AIDS and behavior,2019 05 03,"Argentina has one of the highest suicide rates in Latin America and the Caribbean. Though people living with HIV are at increased risk for suicidal behavior, little research on suicide risk has been conducted among HIV-positive people in this region. This study examined risk factors for suicidal ideation among HIV-infected adults (N = 360) re-engaging in care in Argentina. Overall, 21% of participants reported suicidal ideation in the past week. In adjusted logistic regression models, younger age, increased depressive symptomatology, and drug abuse were associated with suicidal ideation (p < 0.05); decreased motivation for adherence and fewer months since initiating antiretroviral therapy approached significance (p = 0.07). Suicidal ideation was common in this sample of HIV-positive patients in Argentina. Findings highlight the need for routine risk assessment and interventions integrated into the HIV care continuum, addressing depression, substance use, and suicidal behavior.",Alone But Supported: A Qualitative Study of an HIV Self-testing App in an Observational Cohort Study in South Africa.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31049809,AIDS and behavior,2019 05 03,"HIV self-testing has the potential to improve test access and uptake, but concerns remain regarding counselling and support during and after HIV self-testing. We investigated an oral HIV self-testing strategy together with a mobile phone/tablet application to see if and how it provided counselling and support, and how it might impact test access. This ethnographic study was nested within an ongoing observational cohort study in Cape Town, South Africa. Qualitative data was collected from study participants and study staff using 33 semi-structured interviews, one focus group discussion, and observation notes. The app provided information and guidance while also addressing privacy concerns. The flexibility and support provided by the strategy gave participants more control in choosing whom they included during testing. Accessibility concerns included smartphone access and usability issues for older and rural users. The adaptable access and support of this strategy could aid in expanding test access in South Africa.",Computer-Based Substance Use Reporting and Acceptance of HIV Testing Among Emergency Department Patients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31049808,AIDS and behavior,2019 05 03,"More than 10 years after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended routine HIV testing for patients in emergency departments (ED) and other clinical settings, as many as three out of four patients may not be offered testing, and those who are offered testing frequently decline. The current study examines how participant characteristics, including demographics and reported substance use, influence the efficacy of a video-based intervention designed to increase HIV testing among ED patients who initially declined tests offered by hospital staff. Data from three separate trials in a high volume New York City ED were merged to determine whether patients (N = 560) were more likely to test post-intervention if: (1) they resembled people who appeared onscreen in terms of gender or race; or (2) they reported problem substance use. Chi Square and logistic regression analyses indicated demographic concordance did not significantly increase likelihood of accepting an HIV test. However, participants who reported problem substance use (n = 231) were significantly more likely to test for HIV in comparison to participants who reported either no problem substance use (n = 190) or no substance use at all (n = 125) (x2 = 6.830, p < 0.05). Specifically, 36.4% of patients who reported problem substance use tested for HIV post-intervention compared to 30.5% of patients who did not report problem substance use and 28.8% of participants who did not report substance use at all. This may be an important finding because substance use, including heavy alcohol or cannabis use, can lead to behaviors that increase HIV risk, such as sex with multiple partners or decreased condom use.",Statins for Primary Prevention in Those Aged 70 Years and Older: A Critical Review of Recent Cholesterol Guidelines.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31049807,Drugs & aging,2019 05 03,"The risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease rises with age and remains the leading cause of death in older adults. Evidence for the use of statins for primary prevention in older adults is limited, despite the possibility that this population may derive significant clinical benefit given its increased cardiovascular risk. Until publication of the 2018 AHA/ACC/AACVPR/AAPA/ABC/ACPM/ADA/AGS/APhA/ASPC/NLA/PCNA guideline on the Management of Blood Cholesterol, and the 2019 ACC/AHA Guideline on the Primary Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease, guidelines for statin prescription in older adults remained unchanged despite new evidence of possible benefit in older adults. In this review, we present key updates in the 2018 and 2019 guidelines and the evidence informing these updates. We compare the discordant recommendations of the seven major North American and European guidelines on cholesterol management released in the past 5 years and highlight gaps in the literature regarding primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in older adults. As most cardiovascular events in older adults are nonfatal, we ask how clinicians should weigh the risks and benefits of continuing a statin for primary prevention in older adults. We also reframe the concept of deprescribing of statins in the older population, using the Geriatrics 5Ms framework: Mind, Mobility, Medications, Multi-complexity, and what Matters Most to older adults. A recent call from the National Institute on Aging for a statin trial focusing on older adults extends from similar concerns.",Limbic and cortical control of phonation for speech in response to a public speech preparation stressor.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31049806,Brain imaging and behavior,2019 05 03,"Knowledge on brain networks subserving vocalization in vocally healthy individuals under various task conditions is scarce but paramount to understand voice disorders. The aims of our study were to determine (1) the effect of social-evaluative stress on the central neural control of phonation underlying speech production; and (2) the neural signature, personality profile, and aerodynamic vocal function in relation to salivary cortisol responses. Thirteen vocally healthy females underwent an event-related sparse-sampling fMRI protocol consisting of voiced and whispered sentence productions with and without exposure to the social-evaluative stressor public speaking anticipation. Participants completed a personality questionnaire, rating scales of negative emotional state, and provided salivary cortisol samples. In the total sample, the task contrast of voiced productions revealed that stressor exposure resulted in a peak activation in the right caudate with concomitant deactivations in the bilateral pgACC and aMCC, and right IFG, BA 9, BA 10, insula, putamen, and thalamus. There were individual differences in stressor-induced brain activations as a function of stress reactivity with greater cortisol reactivity linked with lower laryngeal motor cortex activity and lower scores on aspects of extraversion. Our data confirm that stress alters the phonatory control for speech production through limbic-motor interactions. The findings support the Trait Theory of Voice Disorders (Roy and Bless 2000) and help provide critical insights to the study of voice disorders such as primary muscle tension dysphonia.",Retrieval shifts in spatial skill acquisition are collective rather than item-specific.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31049805,Memory & cognition,2019 05 03,"How do people improve their ability to intercept moving targets? Prior research and theories of skill acquisition suggest that individuals engage in item-specific retrieval shifts (Anglim & Wynton, 2015; Logan, 1988; Palmeri, 1997; Rickard, 1997, 2004; Touron, 2006; Wilkins & Rawson, 2010). However, this prior research examined performance on nonspatial, nondynamic tasks. In three experiments, we pitted four hypotheses against each other, to test skill acquisition for intercepting repeated trajectories in a spatial and dynamic task: the item-specific algorithmic speedup hypothesis, the item-specific retrieval shift hypothesis, the collective retrieval shift hypothesis, and the combined hypothesis (item-specific algorithmic speedup followed by a collective retrieval shift). We found evidence for the combined hypothesis. Specifically, under easy conditions, we found small improvements on repeated trajectories that were attributable to item-specific algorithmic speedup. By contrast, under difficult conditions, we found strong evidence that the performance benefits for repeated trajectories were driven primarily by a collective shift from algorithmic to direct-retrieval strategies. This evidence for collective retrieval shift is in direct contrast to theories suggesting item-specific retrieval shifts. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.",Computer-aided diagnosis of gastrointestinal stromal tumors: a radiomics method on endoscopic ultrasound image.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31049803,International journal of computer assisted radiology and surgery,2019 05 03,The purpose of our study is to propose a preoperative computer-aided diagnosis system based on a radiomics method to differentiate gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) of the higher-risk group (HRG) from those of the lower-risk group (LRG) on endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) images.,Extending pretrained segmentation networks with additional anatomical structures.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31049802,International journal of computer assisted radiology and surgery,2019 06 15,"For comprehensive surgical planning with sophisticated patient-specific models, all relevant anatomical structures need to be segmented.

Therefore, being able to build segmentation models with datasets from different studies and centers in an incremental fashion is highly desirable.",Development of a sequence-characterized amplified region marker for detection of Ascochyta rabiei causing Ascochyta blight in chickpea.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31049801,Folia microbiologica,2019 05 03,"Ascochyta blight of chickpea is caused by Ascochyta rabiei (Pass.) Labr. which is primarily seedborne. For rapid detection and precise identification of A. rabiei, a sequence-characterized amplified region (SCAR) marker was developed for detection of genomic DNA and infected plant DNA. An SSR primer amplified monomorphic band was cloned in pGEM®-T easy vector and sequenced. The best primer pair was selected and validated on A. rabiei. The specificity and sensitivity of the SCAR-based marker designated as MBAR was evaluated using conventional PCR and real-time PCR. The marker produced consistently an amplicon size of 196 bp in all A. rabiei isolates tested. The sensitivity of the marker was 0.1 ng of genomic fungal DNA and 0.5 ng of plant DNA by conventional PCR and 0.5 pg of A. rabiei DNA and 1.0 pg of plant DNA by real-time PCR. This is the first SCAR marker having high specificity and sensitivity towards A. rabiei. The marker may be useful in detecting the pathogen before the disease appearance and in plant quarantine program to detect the pathogen in seed lots."

This study employed a grounded theory approach to explore the key factors contributing to successful work placement experience and the perceived benefits of these placements from the perspective of adolescents with ASD (n = 5), their parents (n = 6) and employers (n = 6). Key factors contributing to success include preparing for the workplace, harnessing strengths and interests and developing work related skills, while the benefits include insight into the workplace, recognising and realising potential, working as a team and the pathway ahead. The findings articulate a framework which could underpin future transition interventions for adolescents with ASD.","Perceived Barriers and Existing Challenges in Participation of Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders: ""He Did Not Understand and No One Else Seemed to Understand Him"".",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31049788,Journal of autism and developmental disorders,2019 05 03,"Social participation is one of the most important predictors of the children's physical and mental health. Although it is evidenced that children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have restricted social participation, it is unclear which factors play a significant role. This research aimed to uncover perceived barriers of social participation by involving 26 stakeholders including parents of children with ASD, youth with ASD, and clinicians working with individuals with ASD in focus groups and interviews. Using thematic analysis yielded three themes including (a) difficulty understanding social situations; (b) maladaptive behaviours; and (c) conflicting priorities and restricted nature of training.

This study aimed to clarify the mechanism(s) of the MRP8/14-augmented inflammatory response in mice with pneumococcal meningitis. Streptococcus pneumoniae (SP) meningitis was established by intracerebral injection of SP suspension. Balb/c mice were randomly divided into four groups and received the following injections: phosphate-buffer saline (PBS), MRP8/14 alone, SP alone, and SP plus MRP8/14. At 6 h, 24 h and 48 h postinfection, the clinical disease status was measured by the modified neurological severity score test, body weight loss and degree of cerebral edema; mice were anaesthetized, blood samples and brain samples were collected and brain inflammation was detected by haematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining; tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-reactive protein (CRP) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) levels in serum and brain homogenates were assessed by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and the mRNA levels of the above cytokines in brain homogenates were measured by polymerase chain reaction (PCR); and the expression of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) p65 in brain tissues was determined by immunohistochemical assay. In this study, we identified that MRP8/14 substantially augmented the SP-stimulated inflammatory response, aggravated clinical disease status and exacerbated SP-induced brain edema in a murine model of pneumococcal meningitis. Exogenous administration of MRP8/14 significantly enhanced mRNA and protein expression of the proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines TNF-α, CRP, IL-6 and MCP-1 in brain homogenates and serum from mice with pneumococcal meningitis, which may be related to the NF-κB signalling pathway. We further found that MRP8/14 strongly augmented SP-induced phosphorylation of NF-κB p65 in brain tissue slices from the same model. In conclusion, our results indicated that MRP8/14 augmented the inflammatory response in mice with pneumococcal meningitis and contributed to the development of disease, which was probably through NF-κB signalling pathway activation.",Evaluating the effects of switching from cigarette smoking to using a heated tobacco product on health effect indicators in healthy subjects: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31049783,Internal and emergency medicine,2019 05 03,"Tobacco heating products (THPs) are a potentially safer alternative to combustible cigarette smoking. Through continued use, THPs may reduce smoking-related disease risk, whilst maintaining the sensorial experience and nicotine delivery sought by smokers. While literature evidence of the biological effects of THP aerosol exposure is increasing, there remains a knowledge gap with respect to substantiation of THP reduced risk potential in longer term real-life use. This randomized, multi-centre, controlled clinical study will test the hypotheses that following a switch from combustible cigarettes to a THP for 1 year, participants will experience a sustained reduction in exposure to tobacco-related toxicants that will lead to favourable changes in health effect indicators associated with smoking-related disease development. Changes in such indicators will be contextualized against smoking cessation and never-smoker cohorts. Up to 280 participants who do not intend to quit smoking will be randomized to continued combustible smoking (arm A, up to n = 80) or a commercially available THP (arm B n = 200). Furthermore, up to 190 participants with a high intent to quit smoking will undergo smoking cessation (arm D), and 40 never smokers will serve as a control group (arm E). Recruitment numbers were determined to be sufficient to achieve n = 50 in arms A, B and D, at study end. Enrolment started in March 2018 and the trial is scheduled to be completed in March 2020. Data from this study will be a valuable addition to the growing body of evidence in the field of understanding the individual and public health impact of THPs.Clinical Trial Registration: https://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN81075760.",Preterm Modulation of Connectivity by Endogenous Generators: The Theta Temporal Activities in Coalescence with Slow Waves.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31049782,Brain topography,2019 05 03,"The neuronal activity of the preterm brain is characterized by various endogenous activities whose roles in neurodevelopmental maturation processes have not been fully elucidated. The preterm EEG is characterized by discontinuities composed of short bursts of activity with dominant low frequencies. One of the earliest endogenous activities is the theta temporal activity in coalescence with slow waves (TTA-SW), which appears at 24 to 32 weeks of gestational age (wGA). The present study investigated the influence of TTA-SW on the spatial organization of the early preterm brain network. To achieve this objective, High-Density EEG data were recorded from preterm infants (29-32 wGA) and functional connectivity (FC) was estimated from the scalp EEG. TTA-SW, particularly in the theta band, induced increased FC between left temporal and left frontal areas and between left temporal and parietal areas with TTA-SW at the left temporal region, while FC was limited to the right temporal regions in the case of TTA-SW at the right temporal region. Regardless of the lateralization of TTA-SW, long-range FCs were observed between left frontal to left parietal areas, suggesting that these regions, together with the temporal region, provide a basis for coherent neuronal activation across distal cortical regions. TTA-SW dynamic features showed that brief phases of TTA-SW had an impact on both local and whole brain network organization, supporting the importance of TTA-SW as a biomarker of brain development.",A micromechanical muscle model for determining the impact of motor unit fiber clustering on force transmission in aging skeletal muscle.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31049781,Biomechanics and modeling in mechanobiology,2019 05 03,"This study used a micromechanical finite element muscle model to investigate the effects of the redistribution of spatial activation patterns in young and old muscle. The geometry consisted of a bundle of 19 active muscle fibers encased in endomysium sheets, surrounded by passive tissue to model a fascicle. Force was induced by activating combinations of the 19 active muscle fibers. The spacial clustering of muscle fibers modeled in this study showed unbalanced strains suggesting tissue damage at higher strain levels may occur during higher levels of activation and/or during dynamic conditions. These patterns of motor unit remodeling are one of the consequences of motor unit loss and reinnervation associated with aging. The results did not reveal evident quantitative changes in force transmission between old and young adults, but the patterns of stress and strain distribution were affected, suggesting an uneven distribution of the forces may occur within the fascicle that could provide a mechanism for muscle injury in older muscle.",MR urethrography versus X-ray urethrography compared with operative findings for the evaluation of urethral strictures.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31049780,International urology and nephrology,2019 05 03,We compared the accuracy of magnetic resonance (MR) urethrography and X-ray urethrography with operative findings for urethral strictures and observed their effects on treatment.,Observed racial disparity in the negative predictive value of multi-parametric MRI for the diagnosis for prostate cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31049779,International urology and nephrology,2019 05 03,"To evaluate the trend that despite recent advances in the screening, diagnosis, and management of prostate cancer (PCa), African-Americans (AAs) continue to have poorer outcomes compared to their Caucasian (CAU) counterparts.

To overcome endogeneity concerns in the estimation of these relationships, we exploit the polygenic risk score (PRS) for ADHD in a cohort where the diagnosis of and treatment for ADHD were generally not available. We find that an increase in the PRS for ADHD reduces the likelihood of employment, individual income, and household wealth. Moreover, it increases the likelihood of receiving social security disability benefits, unemployment or worker compensation, and other governmental transfers.

As previous studies concerning piriformis pyomyositis had lower level of evidence and no systematic review has been published yet, we performed a systematic search to review and describe causes, symptoms, red flags, and available treatment options for piriformis pyomyositis. Using PubMed and PubMed Central databases, we found 21 articles describing 23 cases of piriformis pyomyositis. Based on the retrieved information, alongside acute sciatica like buttock and/or hip pain, high-grade fever, aggressive deep seated gluteal pain, neurological deficit of sciatic nerve distribution, positive straight leg raising test, and raised inflammatory biomarkers (erythrocyte sedimentation rate, ESR, C-reactive protein, CRP) provide clues for diagnosis of piriformis pyomyositis. Some cases were very ill but no death was documented. Staphylococcus aureus was the most common pathogen, but Group A as well as Group β Streptococcus, Salmonella typhi, Proteus mirabilis, Brucella melitensis, and Escherichia coli were also involved in the disorder. To treat the piriformis pyomyositis, broad-spectrum antibiotics were found to be useful; however, sometimes, antibiotic switching was warranted based on blood and tissue aspirate reports.

In this latest version, all of the procedure was carried out in accordance with grading of recommendations assessment, development and evaluation (GRADE) system. It includes comprehensive literature search, systematic review, and determination of the recommendation by multidisciplinary expert panel which consisted of medical doctors, pharmacists, nurses, statisticians, and patients from patient advocacy group. Recently, we have had various types of chemotherapeutic drugs like kinase inhibitors or immune-checkpoint inhibitors. Thus, the guideline proposes to categorize patients into three entities: (1) driver oncogene-positive, (2) PD-L1 ≥ 50%, and (3) others. Based on this subgroup, 31 clinical questions were described. We believe that this attempt enables clinicians to choose appropriate treatment easier.

There is little information available, however, on the roles of that structure in seed germination and initial seedling development-crucial plant life cycle phases. The study therefore sought to evaluate the roles of CP in the germination and post-seminal development of the recalcitrant seeds of Mauritia flexuosa, an ecologically and economically important neotropical palm. The CP and the embryo/vegetative axis were evaluated during germination and initial seedling development using standard morphological, anatomical, histochemical, and ultrastructural methodologies. Evaluations of dormant seeds incubated for 60 days were also performed. The CP (a) promotes seedling protrusion in the germination, extending the embryo axis outside the seed; (b) protects the vegetative axis through the development of coating rich in phenolic compounds and lignin; (c) participates in reserve translocation, with the conversion of its own proteinaceous/mucilaginous reserves into transitional starch, as well as acting in the transport of endospermic reserves; (d) favors aeration, with the formation of pathways among stomata, substomatal chambers, and intercellular spaces; (e) controls seedling morphogenesis by modulating the curvature of the vegetative axis; and (f) contributes to overcoming seed bank dormancy through cytological alterations (protein synthesis and mitochondrial proliferation). The cotyledonary petiole of palms is a unique and multifunctional structure among angiosperms, with crucial roles in germination and seedling establishment.",Elemental composition of pufferfish species from Northeastern Mediterranean Sea.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31049756,Environmental monitoring and assessment,2019 05 05,"This study aimed at comparing the elemental levels of muscle and liver tissues of four pufferfish (Lagocephalus sceleratus, Lagocephalus spadiceus, Lagocephalus suezensis, and Torquigener flavimaculosus), which are common in the Northeastern Mediterranean Sea (Mersin Bay), in terms of sex and seasonal variables. Na, Mg, P, K, and Ca levels in the muscle tissues of pufferfish range from 1848.4 to 16495.7, 824.4 to 2684.5, 6936.2 to 20486.6, 13019.3 to 36165.5, and 276.4 to 5566.5 μg g-1, respectively.

This delay is due to different factors related to lifestyle, such as the development of a professional career or the absence of the right partner. As a consequence, women who defer childbearing may find themselves affected by age-related infertility when they decide to conceive. Fertility preservation techniques are, therefore, proposed as a solution for these women. Among all possible solutions, social freezing is an alternative strongly discussed from a scientific, social and ethical point of view.A survey among 930 female students at the University of Padova (Italy) investigated their knowledge and attitudes on social egg freezing and their potential intentions regarding this procedure. To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the level of awareness of age-related infertility in Italian young women and their attitudes regarding acceptable indications for elective oocyte freezing, their potential personal use, the circumstances in which they would then decide to use cryopreserved eggs, and their attitudes towards cost coverage and oocyte donation.Data collected in this study revealed some important points about young women and their knowledge about social oocyte freezing in Italy as compared to other European countries and the United States.Overall, 34.3% of the students reported having heard about the possibility of oocyte cryopreservation for non-medical reasons and being aware of the meaning of this procedure; only 19.5% were in favour of social egg freezing and 48.4% thought that the cost for this procedure should be borne entirely by the woman herself. Regarding egg donation, the majority of students (64.9%) would not accept donating their eggs to a known woman or couple and 42.5% would instead accept donating to a biobank.Our study shows that young Italian women are significantly less aware of age-related decline in fertility and the possibility of using social egg freezing compared to their similarly situated counterparts in other Western countries.",ZnO Porous Nanosheets with Partial Surface Modification for Enhanced Charges Separation and High Photocatalytic Activity Under Solar Irradiation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31049742,Nanoscale research letters,2019 05 22,"ZnO porous nanosheets (PNSs) with partial surface modification were fabricated by means of depositing amorphous BiVO4 on basic zinc carbonate nanosheets followed by calcining at 500 °C. At low levels of anchored amorphous BiVO4, the surface of ZnO PNSs was partially evolved into Bi3.9Zn0.4V1.7O10.5 (BZVO). The measurements for photocurrent and photoluminescence demonstrate that partial-surface BZVO-modified ZnO PNSs (ZB_0.01) could significantly inhibit the recombination of photoinduced carriers. This should be ascribable to the driving from surface potential difference produced by non-junction part and vertical p-n BZVO/ZnO junction part on the surface of ZB_0.01. Furthermore, the photocatalytic efficiency in degradation of reactive brilliant red for ZB_0.01 under weak solar irradiation is about 8 times higher than that under strong visible-light illumination. The discussion regarding reasons for this enhancement demonstrates that each component in photocatalysts having rational valence-band maximum and conduction-band minimum energy levels is essential to obtain high-activity sunlight-driven catalysts.",The study of killing effect and inducing apoptosis of 630-nm laser on lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells mediated by hematoporphyrin derivatives in vitro.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31049741,Lasers in medical science,2019 05 03,"To investigate the killing effect and inducing apoptosis of 630-nm laser mediated by hematoporphyrin derivatives (HPD) on human lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells.

And, meanwhile, the simple photosensitizer group, laser irradiation group, and blank control group were established. Then, CCK8, Hoechst 33258 staining, RT-PCR, and Western blot were employed. HPD-PDT proved no killing effect on the lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells with photosensitizer or laser irradiation alone. With the combination, the killing effect was obvious. CCK8 showed that the A549 cell viability in 15 μg/ml and 20 μg/ml HPD group as well as 50 mW/cm2, 75 mW/cm2, and 100 mW/cm2 power density group decreased significantly compared with the control group. Hoechst 33258 staining showed that with the increase of HPD concentration, the cells presented chromatin fixation and hyperchromatic nuclei. The Annexin V-FITC/PI double staining was used to detect the apoptosis rate, and the difference was statistically significant. RT-PCR and Western blot showed that the expression of Caspase-3 and Bax were significantly up-regulated. However, the Bcl-2 and Survivin were significantly down-regulated in the HPD-PDT group, while those of the other three groups showed no significant changes. HPD-PDT has a significant effect on A549 cells. The mechanism of action may be related to the upregulation of the expression of Caspase-3, Bax, and downregulation of the expression of Bcl-2 and Survivin.",A systematic review on the use of the breast lesion excision system in breast disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31049740,Insights into imaging,2019 05 16,To outline the current status of and provide insight into possible future research on the breast lesion excision system (BLES) as a diagnostic and therapeutic device.,Integration of Environmental Friendly Perovskites for High-efficiency White Light-emitting Diodes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31049739,Nanoscale research letters,2019 05 22,"Perovskite quantum dots (QDs) have been widely used in white light-emitting diodes (WLEDs), due to their high quantum yield (QY), tunable bandgap, and simple preparation.

It is observed that both transverse electric (TE)- and transverse magnetic (TM)-polarized light extraction efficiencies (LEEs) are sensitive to the spacing and inclined angle for the meshed structure. We also find that the LEE will not be increased when a large filling factor is adopted for the meshed structures, which is because of the competition among the p-GaN layer absorption, the Al metal plasmon resonant absorption, and the scattering effect by meshed structures. The very strong scattering effect occurring in the hybrid p-GaN nanorod/p-AlGaN truncated nanocone contacts can enormously enhance the LEE for both TE- and TM-polarized light, e.g., when the inclined angle is 30°, the LEE for the TE- and TM-polarized light can be increased by ~ 5 times and ~ 24 times at the emission wavelength of 280 nm, respectively.",Winning at all costs: a review of risk-taking behaviour and sporting injury from an occupational safety and health perspective.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31049736,Sports medicine - open,2019 05 22,"Professional athletes involved in high-performance sport are at a high injury risk, which may lead to long-term health consequences. Professional athletes often expose themselves to risky behaviours, resulting in a higher acceptance level of occupational risk compared to other occupations. To date, many studies have focused on elite athletes' specific injury prevention techniques. The objective of this narrative review is to (1) summarise elite athletes' attitudes towards important occupational safety and health (OSH) practices, including injury reporting, medicine usage and personal protective equipment (PPE) usage, and (2) explore factors that may influence elite athletes' injury awareness. If injury awareness were given a similar weighting in elite sports as in any other highly physical occupation, the potential benefits to elite athletes and their long-term health could be highly significant. This review identifies that most elite athletes are not aware that sporting injuries are occupational injuries requiring behaviours determined by OSH rules. All the 39 studies identified met the moderate methodological quality criteria according to the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT). The factors impeding athletes' injury awareness from achieving occupational health standards are discussed from three safety management perspectives: organisational, societal and individual. This review contributes to a better understanding of how to build a positive safety culture, one that could reduce elite athletes' injury rate and improve their long-term wellbeing. Further research is required to develop a quantitative measurement instrument to evaluate occupational health awareness in the sport context.

We investigate face-centered cubic, body-centered cubic, simple cubic clusters, hexagonal close-packed clusters, and the diamond cubic structure as a function of the number of cluster shells, n. In addition, we examine the Platonic solids in the form of multi-shell clusters, for a total of 19 cluster types.

Behavioral parameters such as active linking (AL) and T maze were evaluated as well as quantitative brain histological changes at 3, 7, and 10 weeks of age, to understand the longitudinal demeanor of the disease. Prefrontal evoked potentials (PFEPs) were recorded to study functional synaptic connectivity and neuronal synchronicity changes. The results showed that EMD induces a decrease of AL and poor performance of T maze, in addition to volumetric changes of cortical and subcortical brain structures and abnormalities in PFEPs. The majority of this changes were absent by neonatal MEM administration. Taking into account that all these abnormalities are associated to SCZ, we propose to MEM as a potential preventive treatment.",An electrochemical daunorubicin sensor based on the use of platinum nanoparticles loaded onto a nanocomposite prepared from nitrogen decorated reduced graphene oxide and single-walled carbon nanotubes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31049702,Mikrochimica acta,2019 06 10,"A glassy carbon electrode (GCE) was modified with a nanocomposite prepared from nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide (N-rGO) and single walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs), and then loaded with platinum nanoparticles (Pt NPs) to obtain a voltammetric sensor for daunorubicin (DNR). Reductive doping of GO and the crystallization of the Pt NPs were carried out in a one-step hydrothermal process. The modified electrode was characterized by cyclic voltammetry and differential pulse voltammetry. It exhibited high sensitivity compared with unmodified electrode. Some experimental parameters which affected sensor response were optimized. Under optimum conditions and at a working voltage of typically -0.56 V (vs. Ag/AgCl), the sensor has a low detection limit (3 ng mL-1), a wide linear range (0.01-6 μg mL-1) and good long-term stability. The method was successfully applied to the sensitive and rapid determination of DNR in spiked human serum samples. Graphical abstract Platinum nanoparticles were loaded onto a nanocomposite prepared from nitrogen decorated reduced graphene oxide and single-walled carbon nanotubes (N-rGO-SWCNTs-Pt) and then used for electrochemical determination of daunorubicin (DNR).",Evaluation of spatio-temporal variations in water quality of Zerveli stream (northern Turkey) based on water quality index and multivariate statistical analyses.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31049701,Environmental monitoring and assessment,2019 05 05,"This study of Zerveli stream, Kastamonu, aims to present an assessment of its water quality and to determine the basic factors having a significant effect on the water to identify how these factors account for variations in water quality. Samples of surface water were obtained on a monthly basis between December 2016 and November 2017 at 11 stations along the watercourse. According to these samples, 28 different water quality parameters determining the water quality were evaluated. The results were assessed with respect to the environmental water quality and irrigation water quality. For this purpose, the water quality index (WQI), sodium absorption rate (SAR), sodium percentage (%Na), and residual sodium carbonate (RSC) parameters were calculated. WQI values within the year ranged between 17.26 (excellent) and 223.05 (very poor). Based on the monthly mean values, the water quality was found to be good in December, February, July, and August and poor in the remaining months. Water quality tended to deteriorate the greater the distance from the water source. According to factor analysis (FA), salinity, pH, temperature (T), electrical conductivity (EC), suspended solid matter (SSM), chemical oxygen demand (COD), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), SO42-, SO32-, NO2--N, NO-3-N, NH+4-N, and Cl are the main variables responsible for changes in the ecosystem. According to analysis of the irrigation water quality, the stream was found to be suitable for irrigation in terms of SAR (1.07-3.25) and %Na (37.58-61.89) but problematic in terms of RSC (3.80-5.58) values.","Cloning, expression, characterization, and immunological properties of citrate synthase from Echinococcus granulosus.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31049696,Parasitology research,2019 05 20,"The larval stages of the tapeworm Echinococcus granulosus (Cestoda: Taeniidae) are the causative agent of cystic echinococcosis, one of the most important parasitic zoonoses worldwide. E. granulosus has a complete pathway for the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA), in which citrate synthase (CS) is the key enzyme. Here, we cloned and expressed CS from E. granulosus (Eg-CS) and report its molecular characterization. The localization of this protein during different developmental stages and mRNA expression patterns during H2O2 treatment were determined. We found that Eg-CS is a highly conserved protein, consisting of 466 amino acids. In western blotting assays, recombinant Eg-CS (rEg-CS) reacted with E. granulosus-positive sheep sera and anti-rEg-CS rabbit sera, indicating that Eg-CS has good antigenicity and immunoreactivity. Localization studies, performed using immunohistochemistry, showed that Eg-CS is ubiquitously expressed in the larva, germinal layer, and adult worm sections of E. granulosus. Eg-CS mRNA expression levels increased following H2O2 exposure. In conclusion, citrate synthase might be involved in the metabolic process in E. granulosus. An assessment of the serodiagnostic potential of rEg-CS based on indirect ELISA showed that, although sensitivity (93.55%) and specificity (80.49%) are high, cross-reactivity with other parasites precludes its use as a diagnostic antigen.",First report of trypanosomiasis in farmed largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) from China: pathological evaluation and taxonomic status.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31049695,Parasitology research,2019 05 20,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of trypanosomes on cultured largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) and describe the taxonomic identification of the parasite. The effects of the parasite on M. salmoides were examined based on clinical symptoms, hemograms, histopathology, and serum biochemistry. Diseased fish showed typical clinical symptoms of trypanosomiasis, which included lethargy, anorexia, and histopathological lesions in the liver, head kidney, and spleen. The serum of diseased fish had significantly lower concentrations of glucose, triglyceride, and low-density lipoprotein, and significantly higher alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activities. The morphology of the trypanosomes was also analyzed using light microscopy, and their 18S rDNA sequence was analyzed to establish genetic relationships with other known strains. We found that the trypomastigote form of the trypanosomes from M. salmoides was similar to those isolated from Pelteobagrus fulvidraco. The trypanosomes had a slender and narrow body with a relatively long free flagellum, not well-developed undulating membrane, and an oval kinetoplast located near the subterminal posterior end of the body. The 18S rDNA sequences of the trypanosome from M. salmoides had the highest similarity (99.8%) with that of P. fulvidraco, suggesting they are identical species. Based on the differences in morphological characteristics and 18S rDNA sequence compared to trypanosomes isolated from other freshwater fish, it is considered as a new species and we propose the name Trypanosoma micropteri n. sp.",Efficacy of silver nanoparticles against the adults and eggs of monogenean parasites of fish.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31049694,Parasitology research,2019 05 20,"Monogeneans are a diverse group of parasites that are commonly found on fish. Some monogenean species are highly pathogenic to cultured fish. The present study aimed to determine the in vitro anthelmintic effect of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) against adults and eggs of monogeneans in freshwater using Cichlidogyrus spp. as a model organism. We tested two types of AgNPs with different synthesis methodologies and size diameters: ARGOVIT (35 nm) and UTSA (1-3 nm) nanoparticles. Damage to the parasite tegument was observed by scanning electron microscopy. UTSA AgNPs were more effective than ARGOVIT; in both cases, there was a concentration-dependent effect. A concentration of 36 μg/L UTSA AgNPs for 1 h was 100% effective against eggs and adult parasites, causing swelling, loss of corrugations, and disruption of the parasite's tegument. This is an interesting result considering that monogenean eggs are typically tolerant to antiparasite drugs and chemical agents. To the best of our knowledge, no previous reports have assessed the effect of AgNPs on any metazoan parasites of fish. Therefore, the present work provides a basis for future research on the control of fish parasite diseases.","Distinct associations between plasma osteoprotegerin, homoarginine and asymmetric dimethylarginine in chronic kidney disease male patients with coronary artery disease.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31049693,Amino acids,2019 05 29,"High plasma osteoprotegerin (OPG) and asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) and low homoarginine (hArg) predict adverse renal and cardiovascular (CV) outcomes. In patients with chronic kidney disease and stable coronary artery disease, plasma OPG correlated with hArg (r = - 0.37, P = 0.03) and the hArg/ADMA molar ratio (r = - 0.46, P = 0.009), which was maintained upon adjustment for renal function. Elevated OPG levels and decreased hArg/ADMA ratios independently predicted 4-year composite CV and renal endpoints (CV death or progression to dialysis). Thus, high OPG and low hArg/ADMA ratio, albeit interrelated, appear to independently contribute to adverse clinical outcome.",Detection of Malachite Green using a colorimetric aptasensor based on the inhibition of the peroxidase-like activity of gold nanoparticles by cetyltrimethylammonium ions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31049692,Mikrochimica acta,2019 06 10,"A specific and sensitive colorimetric aptasensor is described for the determination of Malachite Green (MG). It is exploiting the inhibition of the peroxidase-like activity of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). The AuNPs act as enzyme mimics that catalyze the oxidation of 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) by H2O2 to yield a dark blue solution. The catalytic activity is inhibited by hexadecyl trimethyl ammonium ion, specifically by cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), which causes the aggregation of AuNPs. If a (negatively charged) RNA-aptamer against MG is added, it binds to the positively charged CTAB and prevents aggregation. This enhances the enzyme mimicking activity of the AuNPs and leads to the formation of a dark blue solution. However, in the presence of MG, the aptamer binds to MG, and leads to the aggregation of AuNPs again. The aggregated AuNPs possess a light blue color. A colorimetric method (best performed at 650 nm) was work out that can detect MG in a concentration range from 10 to 500 nmol L-1. The detection limit based on 3σ/k criterion is 1.8 nmol L-1. The assay is highly specific and accurate. Recoveries from spiked real samples (aquaculture water) ranged from 80% to 120%. Graphical abstract Based on the inhibition of cetyltrimethyal ammonium ion and the enhancement of RNA-aptamer, the differences of the peroxidase-like activities of AuNPs can be greatly enlarged with and without MG, by which a colorimetric aptasensor can be constructed for the detection of Malachite Green (MG).","Metal-ion-induced DNAzyme on magnetic beads for detection of lead(II) by using rolling circle amplification, glucose oxidase, and readout of pH changes.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31049691,Mikrochimica acta,2019 06 10,"This work reports on a method for determination of lead(II) ion in environmental water samples. A Pb2+-specific DNAzyme immobilized on magnetic beads was coupled to rolling circle amplification (RCA) and pH meter-based readout. On addition of Pb2+ ion, it induces partial cleavage of the DNAzyme on the magnetic beads. The single-stranded DNA remaining on the magnetic beads is used as the primer to trigger the RCA reaction with the assistance of a circular DNA template, polymerase and dNTPs. This results in the formation of numerous oligonucleotide repeats on the magnetic bead. Subsequently, these repeats hybridize with glucose oxidase-labeled single-stranded DNA (GOx-ssDNA) to form a long concatamer containing tens to hundreds of GOx-ssDNA tandem repeats. The concatenated GOx molecules oxidize glucose, and this is accompanied by a drop in the local pH value. The pH values (vs. background signal) drop linearly when Pb2+ concentrations increase from 1.0-100 nM, and the detection limit is 0.91 nM. The method displays good reproducibility, high specificity and acceptable accuracy. It was applied to the analysis of spiked water samples, and results compared favorably with those obtained by ICP-MS.

To better understand the onset and persistence of changes caused by postnatal day 7 (P7) ethanol treatment, we examined neocortical cell numbers, volume, surface area and thickness from neonatal to post-adolescent ages. In control mice, total neuron number decreased from P8 to reach approximately stable levels at about P30, as expected from normal programmed cell death. Cortical thickness reached adult levels by P14, but cortical volume and surface area continued to increase from juvenile (P20-30) to post-adolescent (P54-93) ages. P7 ethanol caused a reduction of total neurons by P14, but this deficit was transient, with later ages having only small and non-significant reductions. Previous studies also reported transient neuron loss after neonatal lesions that might be partially explained by an acute acceleration of normally occurring programmed cell death. GABAergic neurons expressing parvalbumin, calretinin, or somatostatin were reduced by P14, but unlike total neurons the reductions persisted or increased in later ages. Cortical volume, surface area and thickness were also reduced by P7 ethanol. Cortical volume showed evidence of a transient reduction at P14, and then was reduced again in post-adolescent ages. The results show a developmental sequence of neonatal ethanol effects. By juvenile ages the cortex overcomes the P14 deficit of total neurons, whereas P14 GABA cell deficits persist. Cortical volume reductions were present at P14, and again in post-adolescent ages."

However, very few studies have focused on the association between LA function and LA-LVA, and the mechanism of appearance of LA-LVA remains unclear. We investigated the marker for the existence of LA-LVA using automated 3-D mapping system. We studied 92 patients (75 males, 68 ± 9 years, 47 non-paroxysmal AF) who received CA for AF and 40 control patients without AF. Echocardiography was performed before the CA, and high-density voltage mapping during sinus rhythm after pulmonary isolation was performed in AF patients. LA-LVA was defined as < 0.5 mV, and LA stiffness index (LASI) was defined as the ratio of E/e' to LA peak strain. LA-LVA (LVA burden > 10%) was detected in 19/92 AF patients (21%). Patients with LA-LVA were associated with higher LASI (1.64 ± 1.70 vs. 0.61 ± 0.46, p < 0.0001), larger LA volume, non-paroxysmal AF, higher brain natriuretic peptide, structural heart disease, and older age. On multivariate analysis, LASI, LA volume, and age were independently associated with the existence of LA-LVA. Of these markers, the highest area under curve was obtained with LASI. The rate of high LASI (≥ 0.552) was highest in AF patients with LA-LVA. Moreover, the existence of LVA in anterior LA wall was associated with higher LASI. High LA stiffness index was associated with the presence of LA-LVA. The LA-LVA might be attributed to LA functional remodeling rather than LA anatomical remodeling.",Residual pulmonary hypertension is associated with clinical outcomes in patients with acute pulmonary thromboembolism.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31049674,Heart and vessels,2019 05 03,"In patients with acute pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE), the influence of residual pulmonary hypertension (PH) has not been well investigated.

We included acute PTE patients who underwent echocardiogram after acute phase between January 2009 and December 2016. These patients were divided into residual PH and non-residual PH groups according to the value of estimated right ventricular systolic pressure (eRVSP) by echocardiogram after acute phase (the residual PH group: eRVSP ≥ 40 mmHg, the non-residual PH group: eRVSP < 40 mmHg). Kaplan-Meier survival curves were applied to investigate whether the residual PH were associated with PTE-related death or recurrent PTE in patients with acute PTE. A total of 49 patients with acute PTE were allocated into the residual PH group (n = 10) and non-residual PH group (n = 39). Median follow-up period for 49 patients was 7 months. The event-free survival rate was significantly lower in the residual PH group as compared with the non-residual PH group (p = 0.003), whereas there was no statistical significance between two groups stratified by initial PH or not (p = 0.97).

For optimal handling of CIEDs in a palliative care situation, patients have to be informed that pacemakers or cardiac resynchronization therapy have no life-prolonging effect in this situation but only limit suffering, particularly due to dyspnea.

We have evaluated the clinical relevance of the Revised International Staging System (R-ISS) by comparing it with the original ISS in 718 Japanese patients. The distribution of patients according to response was similar between the ISS and R-ISS stages. Treatment response was greatly influenced by initial treatment modalities and deeper response was observed more frequently in transplanted patients. The R-ISS discriminated the difference in OS between the stages more distinctly than the ISS (p = 9.0 × 10-15 and p = 4.0 × 10-10, respectively). Differences in OS were clarified by both R-ISS and ISS in non-transplanted patients (p = 2.4 × 10-12 and p = 1.4 × 10-8, respectively), but the ISS failed to distinguish the difference between the stages in transplanted patients (p = 0.13). In contrast, the R-ISS could at least discriminate the excellent prognosis of stage I patients whereas the distinction between stage II and III was not that clear (p = 0.033). The R-ISS stage II encompassed a large number of patients, and the prognosis was heterogeneous depending on the fulfillment of prognostic factors such as LDH and adverse cytogenetics. These results suggest that treatment factors and prognostic factors greatly affect the therapeutic response and outcome, and the R-ISS is superior to ISS in prognostication of both transplant-eligible and -ineligible patients in our current clinical practice.",Transcriptional control of macrophage polarisation in type 2 diabetes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31049647,Seminars in immunopathology,2019 05 03,"Type-2 diabetes (T2D) is considered today as an inflammatory disease. Inflammatory processes in T2D are orchestrated by macrophage activation in different organs. Macrophages undergo classical M1 pro-inflammatory or alternative M2 anti-inflammatory activation in response to tissue microenvironmental signals. These subsets of macrophages are characterised by their expression of cell surface markers, secreted cytokines and chemokines. Transcriptional regulation is central to the polarisation of macrophages, and several major pathways have been described as essential to promote the expression of specific genes, which dictate the functional polarisation of macrophages. In this review, we summarise the current knowledge of transcriptional control of macrophage polarisation and the role this plays in development of insulin resistance.",Surgical Management of Tetralogy of Fallot with Unilateral Absence of the Pulmonary Artery.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31049646,Pediatric cardiology,2019 06 10,"Tetralogy of Fallot with unilateral absence of the pulmonary artery (UAPA) is a rare congenital heart disease. The aim of the present study was to examine the surgical strategy for Tetralogy of Fallot with UAPA by summarizing our experience of its treatment. We retrospectively evaluated 17 patients admitted to our hospital for treatment between 2006 and 2017. All patients were diagnosed with absence of the left pulmonary artery. The Nakata Index (NI), NI Z score, and McGoon ratio of the existing pulmonary artery were calculated. All patients were divided into one-stage complete repair (group A) or palliative procedure (group B) groups according to these criteria and surgical treatments. There were nine treated patients in group A, with a mean NI of 595.6 ± 690.32 mm2/m2 (169.3-2433 mm2/m2) and a mean NI Z score of - 1.57 ± 3.02 (- 4.60 to 5.27).

Theoretical and applied genetics. Theoretische und angewandte Genetik,2019 05 03,"A half-diallel population involving five elite grapevine cultivars was generated and genotyped by GBS, and highly-informative segregation data was used to construct a high-density genetic map for Vitis vinifera L. Grapevine is one of the most relevant fruit crops in the world. Deeper genetic knowledge could assist modern grapevine breeding programs to develop new wine grape varieties able to face climate change effects. To assist in the rapid identification of markers for crop yield components, grape quality traits and adaptation potential, we generated a large Vitis vinifera L. population (N = 624) by crossing five red wine cultivars in a half-diallel scheme, which was subsequently sequenced by an efficient GBS procedure. A high number of fully informative genetic variants was detected using a novel mapping approach capable of reconstructing local haplotypes from adjacent biallelic SNPs, which were subsequently used to construct the densest consensus genetic map available for the cultivated grapevine to date. This 1378.3-cM map integrates 10 bi-parental consensus maps and orders 4437 markers in 3353 unique positions on 19 chromosomes. Markers are well distributed all along the grapevine reference genome, covering up to 98.8% of its genomic sequence. Additionally, a good agreement was observed between genetic and physical orders, adding confidence in the quality of this map. Collectively, our results pave the way for future genetic studies (such as fine QTL mapping) aimed to understand the complex relationship between genotypic and phenotypic variation in the cultivated grapevine. In addition, the method used (which efficiently delivers a high number of fully informative markers) could be of interest to other outbred organisms, notably perennial fruit crops.",A breeding strategy targeting the secondary gene pool of bread wheat: introgression from a synthetic hexaploid wheat.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31049633,TAG. Theoretical and applied genetics. Theoretische und angewandte Genetik,2019 05 03,"Introgressing one-eighth of synthetic hexaploid wheat genome through a double top-cross plus a two-phase selection is an effective strategy to develop high-yielding wheat varieties. The continued expansion of the world population and the likely onset of climate change combine to form a major crop breeding challenge. Genetic advances in most crop species to date have largely relied on recombination and reassortment within a relatively narrow gene pool. Here, we demonstrate an efficient wheat breeding strategy for improving yield potentials by introgression of multiple genomic regions of de novo synthesized wheat. The method relies on an initial double top-cross (DTC), in which one parent is synthetic hexaploid wheat (SHW), followed by a two-phase selection procedure. A genotypic analysis of three varieties (Shumai 580, Shumai 969 and Shumai 830) released from this program showed that each harbors a unique set of genomic regions inherited from the SHW parent. The first two varieties were generated from very small populations, whereas the third used a more conventional scale of selection since one of bread wheat parents was a pre-breeding material. The three varieties had remarkably enhanced yield potential compared to those developed by conventional breeding. A widely accepted consensus among crop breeders holds that introducing unadapted germplasm, such as landraces, as parents into a breeding program is a risky proposition, since the size of the breeding population required to overcome linkage drag becomes too daunting. However, the success of the proposed DTC strategy has demonstrated that novel variation harbored by SHWs can be accessed in a straightforward, effective manner. The strategy is in principle generalizable to any allopolyploid crop species where the identity of the progenitor species is known.","BjuWRR1, a CC-NB-LRR gene identified in Brassica juncea, confers resistance to white rust caused by Albugo candida.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31049632,TAG.

Theoretische und angewandte Genetik,2019 05 03,"BjuWRR1, a CNL-type R gene, was identified from an east European gene pool line of Brassica juncea and validated for conferring resistance to white rust by genetic transformation. White rust caused by the oomycete pathogen Albugo candida is a significant disease of crucifer crops including Brassica juncea (mustard), a major oilseed crop of the Indian subcontinent. Earlier, a resistance-conferring locus named AcB1-A5.1 was mapped in an east European gene pool line of B. juncea-Donskaja-IV. This line was tested along with some other lines of B. juncea (AABB), B. rapa (AA) and B. nigra (BB) for resistance to six isolates of A. candida collected from different mustard growing regions of India. Donskaja-IV was found to be completely resistant to all the tested isolates. Sequencing of a BAC spanning the locus AcB1-A5.1 showed the presence of a single CC-NB-LRR protein encoding R gene. The genomic sequence of the putative R gene with its native promoter and terminator was used for the genetic transformation of a susceptible Indian gene pool line Varuna and was found to confer complete resistance to all the isolates. This is the first white rust resistance-conferring gene described from Brassica species and has been named BjuWRR1. Allelic variants of the gene in B. juncea germplasm and orthologues in the Brassicaceae genomes were studied to understand the evolutionary dynamics of the BjuWRR1 gene.",Insights into deployment of DNA markers in plant variety protection and registration.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31049631,TAG. Theoretical and applied genetics. Theoretische und angewandte Genetik,2019 05 03,"The efficiency of phenotype-based assessments of plant variety protection and registration could be improved by the integration of DNA-based testing. We review the current and proposed models in the era of next-generation breeding. The current plant variety protection system relies on morphological description of plant varieties. Distinctness, uniformity, and stability (DUS) assessments determine whether a new variety is distinguishable from common knowledge varieties and exhibits sufficient phenotypic uniformity and stability during two independent growing cycles. However, DUS assessment can be costly, time-consuming and often restricted to a relatively small number of traits that can be influenced by environmental conditions. This calls for the adoption of a DNA-based system which is endorsed by the International Union for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants (UPOV). This could enable examiners to deploy trait-specific DNA markers in DUS testing as well as using such genetic markers to manage reference collections. Within UPOV's system, breeders can freely use protected varieties in breeding programs. However, breeders of protected varieties may seek sharing in ownership of essentially derived varieties once it is proven that they, with the exception of a few distinctive DUS trait(s), conform to parental varieties in essential characteristics. As well as their complementary role in DUS testing, DNA markers have been known as a good replacement of morphological traits in defining boundaries between independently and essentially derived varieties. With the advent of new breeding technologies that allow minor modification in varieties with outcomes of specific merit or utility, detecting distinctness between varieties may become increasingly challenging. This, together with the ever-increasing number of varieties with which to compare new candidate varieties, supports the potential utility of using DNA-based approaches in variety description.",Analysis of recombinant inbred line populations derived from wheat landraces to identify new genes for wheat stem sawfly resistance.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31049630,TAG.

Theoretische und angewandte Genetik,2019 05 03,"Wheat landrace accessions were chosen from areas of the world with historical European wheat stem sawfly (Cephus pygmaeus L.) selection pressure to develop six recombinant inbred line (RIL) populations. Molecular maps were constructed, and resistance due to antibiosis and antixenosis was assessed at sites in Montana naturally infested by Cephus cinctus Norton, the wheat stem sawfly (WSS). Novel QTLs were identified along with QTL previously identified in elite germplasm. A newly identified QTL on chromosome 1B provided a new source for pith-filled solid stems. An allele for resistance on chromosome 4A unrelated to solid stems was identified in four of the six RIL populations. A landrace from Turkey, PI 166471, contained alleles at three QTLs causing high levels of larval mortality. None of the QTLs were related to stem solidness, but their combined effect provided resistance similar to that observed in a solid-stemmed check cultivar. These results show the utility of genetic populations derived from geographically targeted landrace accessions to identify new alleles for insect resistance. New PCR-based molecular markers were developed for introgression of novel alleles for WSS resistance into elite lines. Comparison of results with previous analysis of elite cultivars addresses changes in allele frequencies during the wheat breeding process.",[Cysts in the lung : A practical guide to differential diagnosis].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31049629,Der Radiologe,2019 05 08,"Solitary or multiple pulmonary cysts are a relatively rare finding and should always prompt the search for an underlying cause.

The differentiation of diseases with multiple, diffusely distributed cysts from diseases with single or grouped cysts facilitates the definition of the final diagnosis.

There is now ample evidence that motor learning relies on multiple interacting learning processes that operate on different timescales, but the specific cognitive mechanisms that contribute to motor learning remain unclear. Working memory resources appear to be particularly important during the early stages of motor learning, and declines in early motor learning have been associated with working memory performance in older adults. We examined whether age differences in the early stages of motor learning could be reduced or eliminated by reducing the spatial working memory demands during a force-field adaptation task. Groups of younger and older adults made center-out reaching movements to spatial targets either in a repeating four-element sequence, or in a random order. Participants also performed a battery of cognitive tests to further investigate the potential involvement of associative memory, spatial working memory, and procedural learning mechanisms in the early stage of motor learning. Although all groups adapted their movements equally well by the end of the learning phase, older adults only adapted as quickly as younger adults in the sequence condition, with the older adults in the random group exhibiting slower learning in the earliest stage of motor learning. Across all participants, early motor learning performance was correlated with recognition memory performance on an associative memory test. Within the younger random group, who were able to adapt as quickly as the sequence groups, early motor learning performance was also correlated with performance on a test of procedural learning. These findings suggest that age differences in early stages of motor learning can be eliminated if the spatial working memory demands involved in a motor learning task are limited. Moreover, the results suggest that multiple cognitive resources may be utilized during the early stage of learning, and younger adults may be more flexible than older adults in the recruitment of additional cognitive resources to support learning when spatial working memory demands are high.",Alkaliphilic Enzymes and Their Application in Novel Leather Processing Technology for Next-Generation Tanneries.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31049627,Advances in biochemical engineering/biotechnology,2019 05 03,"Leather manufacturing involves conversion of raw skin and hides into leather (stable material) through series of mechanical and chemical operations. The leather industry has attracted public outcry due to severe environmental degradation, pollution and health and safety risks. Currently the industry faces serious sustainability challenge due to extensive use of toxic chemicals and generation of hazardous waste. This chapter describes the polluting chemicals consumed in different stages of conventional leather processing and the nature of waste generated. In order to overcome the hazards caused by toxic chemicals in tanneries and protect the environment, enzymes have been identified as a realistic alternate for chemicals used in beam house operation and waste management. Alkaline active proteases of alkaliphiles offer advantages over the use of conventional chemical catalysts for numerous reasons, for example, they exhibit high catalytic activity and high degree of substrate specificity, can be produced in large amounts and are economically viable. This is because the enzymes of these alkaliphiles are capable of catalysing reactions at the extremes of pH, temperature and salinity of leather-manufacturing processes.The chapter describes how alkaliphilic enzyme can effectively be used in soaking, dehairing, bating and degreasing operations to prevent waste generation, help in recovery of valuable by-products, reduce cost and increase leather quality. It is worth noting that protease has the capability to replace sodium sulphide in the dehairing process. In addition, alkaline proteases have shown remarkable ability in bioremediation of waste generated during the industrial processes. Intensive efforts are being directed towards chemical-based industries to use viable clean technology in their operation to reduce their negative impact on the environment. Similarly, leather industry should adopt the use of eco-friendly reagents such as enzymes to achieve long-term sustainability and clean environment and avert health hazards. Application of enzyme technology in clean leather processing strongly depends on legislation, political will and allocation of financial resources in research, development and implementation of this potentially powerful technology.

Culmorin (CUL), a potentially co-occurring Fusarium metabolite, was recently found to inhibit the corresponding detoxification reaction in plants, namely DON-glucoside formation, raising the question whether CUL might affect also the mammalian counterpart. Using cell-free conditions, CUL when present equimolar (67 µM) or in fivefold excess, suppressed DON glucuronidation by human liver microsomes, reducing the formation of DON-15-glucuronide by 15 and 50%, and DON-3-glucuronide by 30 and 50%, respectively. Substantial inhibitory effects on DON glucuronidation up to 100% were found using the human recombinant uridine 5'-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferases (UGT) 2B4 and 2B7, applying a tenfold excess of CUL (100 µM). In addition, we observed the formation of a novel metabolite of CUL, CUL-11-glucuronide, identified for the first time in vitro as well as in vivo in piglet and human urine samples. Despite the observed potency of CUL to inhibit glucuronidation, no significant synergistic toxicity on cell viability was observed in combinations of CUL (0.1-100 µM) and DON (0.01-10 µM) in HT-29 and HepG2 cells, presumably reflecting the limited capacity of the tested cell lines for DON glucuronidation. However, in humans, glucuronidation is known to represent the main detoxification pathway for DON. The present results, including the identification of CUL-11-glucuronide in urine samples of piglets and humans, underline the necessity of further studies on the relevance of CUL as a potentially co-occurring modulator of DON toxicokinetics in vivo.",[Prioritization or unlimited resources in orthopedics and trauma surgery?],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31049611,Der Unfallchirurg,2019 06 10,"The development of the healthcare system in Germany is increasingly approaching human and economic limits.

Synthesized LQFM032 (0.3, 0.6, or 1.2 mg/kg) was administered by intravenous and intracerebroventricular routes to evaluate the potential alteration of mean arterial pressure, heart rate, and renal sympathetic nerve activity of normotensive and hypertensive rats. Vascular function was further evaluated in isolated vessels, while pharmacological antagonists and computational studies of nitric oxide synthase and muscarinic receptors were performed to assess possible mechanisms of LQFM032 activity. The intravenous and intracerebroventricular administration of LQFM032 elicited a temporal reduction in mean arterial pressure, heart rate, and renal sympathetic nerve activity of rats.

However, it is still not fully known which transcription factors can induce a neuronal chromatin accessibility profile when overexpressed in fibroblasts. To identify such transcription factors, we used ATAC-sequencing to generate differential chromatin accessibility profiles between human fibroblasts and iNeurons, an in vitro neuronal model system obtained by overexpression of Neurog2 in induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). We found that the ONECUT transcription factor sequence motif was strongly associated with differential chromatin accessibility between iNeurons and fibroblasts. All three ONECUT transcription factors associated with this motif (ONECUT1, ONECUT2 and ONECUT3) induced a neuron-like morphology and expression of neuronal genes within two days of overexpression in fibroblasts. We observed widespread remodeling of chromatin accessibility; in particular, we found that chromatin regions that contain the ONECUT motif were in- or lowly accessible in fibroblasts and became accessible after the overexpression of ONECUT1, ONECUT2 or ONECUT3. There was substantial overlap with iNeurons, still, many regions that gained accessibility following ONECUT overexpression were not accessible in iNeurons. Our study highlights both the potential and challenges of ONECUT-based direct neuronal reprogramming.","Trends in Mean Nutrient Intakes of US Infants, Toddlers, and Young Children from 3 Feeding Infants and Toddlers Studies (FITS).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31049587,The Journal of nutrition,2019 05 03,"Many updates to young child feeding recommendations have been published over the past decade, but concurrent intake trends have not been assessed.",Intravenous colistin use for infections due to MDR Gram-negative bacilli in critically ill paediatric patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31049586,The Journal of antimicrobial chemotherapy,2019 05 03,Data are limited regarding the clinical effectiveness and safety of intravenous colistin for treatment of infections due to MDR Gram-negative bacilli (GNB) in paediatric ICUs (PICUs).,MyDGR: a server for identification and characterization of diversity-generating retroelements.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31049585,Nucleic acids research,2019 05 03,"MyDGR is a web server providing integrated prediction and visualization of Diversity-Generating Retroelements (DGR) systems in query nucleotide sequences.

Our research objectives were a proof-of-concept for collaborative surveillance, which involved establishing an academic and government partnership to enhance tick surveillance efforts. The University of Tennessee (UT) collaborated with United States Department of Agriculture Forest Service, Southern Research Station Forest Inventory Analysis (FIA) in an Occupational Health and Safety partnership. UT provided FIA crews in the southeastern United States with vials containing 80% ethanol (July 2014-November 2017). Crew members were instructed to put all encountered ticks into the vials and return them to FIA headquarters. UT identified all submitted ticks to species and life stage, and screened Amblyomma americanum (L.) for Ehrlichia bacteria using a nested-PCR assay.

Whereas its paralog, HCF-1, is known to act as a versatile chromatin-associated protein required for cell proliferation and differentiation, much less is known about HCF-2. Here, we show that HCF-2 is broadly present in human and mouse cells, and possesses activities distinct from HCF-1. Unlike HCF-1, which is excluded from nucleoli, HCF-2 is nucleolar-an activity conferred by one and a half C-terminal Fibronectin type 3 repeats and inhibited by the HCF-1 nuclear localization signal. Elevated HCF-2 synthesis in HEK-293 cells results in phenotypes reminiscent of HCF-1-depleted cells, including inhibition of cell proliferation and mitotic defects. Furthermore, increased HCF-2 levels in HEK-293 cells lead to inhibition of cell proliferation and metabolism gene-expression programs with parallel activation of differentiation and morphogenesis gene-expression programs. Thus, the HCF ancestor appears to have evolved into a small two-member protein family possessing contrasting nuclear versus nucleolar localization, and cell proliferation and differentiation functions.",Spinal Balance/Alignment - Clinical Relevance and Biomechanics.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31049580,Journal of biomechanical engineering,2019 05 03,"In the normal spine due to its curvature in various regions, C7 plumb line (C7PL) passes through the sacrum so that the head is centered over the pelvis-ball and socket hip joints and ankle joints.

Several parameters like the thoracic kyphosis (TK), lumbar lordosis (LL), pelvic incidence (PI), sacral slope (SS), Hip- and leg position influence the sagittal balance and thus the optimal configuration of spinal alignment. Global sagittal imbalance is energy consuming and often painful compensatory mechanisms are developed, that in turn negatively influence the quality of life. This review looks at the clinical aspects of spinal imbalance, and the biomechanics of spinal balance as dictated by the deformities- ankylosing spondylitis, scoliosis and kyphosis; surgical corrections- pedicle subtraction osteotomies and long segment stabilizations and consequent postural complications like the proximal and distal junctional kyphosis.

Here, we examined the association between the canine gut microbiome and age via a bacterial 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequence analysis in a colony of 43 Japanese purebred Shiba Inu dogs. We found that microbial diversity tended to decrease with aging. A differential abundance analysis showed an association of a single specific microbe with aging. The age-related coabundance network analysis showed that two microbial network modules were positively and negatively associated with aging, respectively.

Physical structures, biotic components and abiotic conditions create a patchwork mosaic of potential niches for microbes. Questions remain about mechanisms and patterns of community assembly belowground, including: Do fungal and bacterial communities assemble differently? How do microbes reach the roots of host plants? Within a 4 m2 plot in alpine vegetation, high throughput sequencing of the 16S (bacteria) and ITS1 (fungal) ribosomal RNA genes was used to characterise microbial community composition in roots and adjacent soil of a viviparous host plant (Bistorta vivipara). At fine spatial scales, beta-diversity patterns in belowground bacterial and fungal communities were consistent, although compositional change was greater in bacteria than fungi. Spatial structure and distance-decay relationships were also similar for bacteria and fungi, with significant spatial structure detected at <50 cm among root- but not soil-associated microbes. Recruitment of root microbes from the soil community appeared limited at this sampling and sequencing depth. Possible explanations for this include recruitment from low-abundance populations of soil microbes, active recruitment from neighbouring plants and/or vertical transmission of symbionts to new clones, suggesting varied methods of microbial community assembly for viviparous plants. Our results suggest that even at relatively small spatial scales, deterministic processes play a significant role in belowground microbial community structure and assembly."

In this perspective, we provide the thermodynamic framework for understanding all such future applications of closed bipolar electrochemistry in a 4-electrode configuration. We distinguish the differences between open and closed bipolar electrochemical cells. In particular, the use of the 4-electrode configuration in both open and closed bipolar electrochemical cells with immiscible aqueous-organic solutions is outlined. A comprehensive overview of the influence of external bias on the thermodynamics underpinning electron transfer from an organic redox couple to an aqueous redox couple, or vice versa, by electrons flowing along a conducting bipolar electrode serving as an electronic bridge is provided. Fermi level equilibration between redox species at opposite poles of a bipolar electrode under external bias is discussed. The concept of the Line of Zero Overpotential (LZO) on the bipolar electrode at steady-state conditions under an external bias is introduced. The influence of a series of experimental variables (redox potential of each redox couple, rate constant of electron transfer at each pole, an excess bulk concentration of one redox couple over the other, and areas of the poles of the bipolar electrode in contact with each electrolyte solution) on the final position of the LZO on the bipolar electrode is highlighted. A cyclic voltammogram obtained using a closed bipolar electrochemical cell in a 4-electrode configuration with immiscible aqueous-organic electrolyte solutions is explained using the thermodynamic theory detailed throughout the perspective.

All MMOPs were found to be isostructural to MOPs as determined by XRD. Remarkably, MOPs-(2 and 3) and MMOPs-(5-7) exhibit switchable chromic behaviour associated with reversible structural transformation which was facilitated by dehydration/rehydration or solvent exchange (MeOH/H2O) processes. Chromic behaviour and its mechanism were investigated using IR, solid-state UV-Vis, XRD, PXRD and TGA indicating the coordination/de-coordination of water molecules to be the key factor that influences the colour changes.

In this perspective, the effects of CTAB concentration, pH, and TEOS concentration on the monodisperse sphere morphology of Pd@mSiO2 nanoparticles (NPs) were investigated. In addition, a nucleation mechanism was proposed. Hydrogenation of nitrobenzene to aniline was used as a model reaction to discuss the effect of pore size on the transport rate of the reactants and the product selectivity in metal-catalyzed hydrogenation.

For the purpose of overcoming this issue, an innovative cascade reaction-based colorimetric aptasensor was developed for the achievement of high sensitivity. The biotin-labelled OTA aptamer was immobilized onto streptavidin magnetic beads by means of the biotin-streptavidin reaction. With OTA binding to its aptamer, the structural switching of the aptamer results in the release of the alkaline phosphatase-labelled oligonucleotide, which is partially complementary to the aptamer. Following the magnetic separation, the cascade reaction is initiated through the enzymatic conversion of ascorbic acid-2-phosphate into ascorbic acid. Subsequent to that, the generated ascorbic acid reduces MnO2 nanosheets to Mn2+ ions, accordingly destroying the oxidase-mimicking activity of MnO2 nanosheets. In consequence, it is not possible to oxidize 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB), a substrate for oxidase, with Mn2+ for the production of the blue colour product (TMB Ox). With the increasing amount of OTA, a colour change occurs from blue to colourless. The cascade reaction has the potential of greatly amplifying the detection signal, together with remarkably improving the sensitivity, making this colorimetric sensor a universal and promising platform for the highly sensitive detection of mycotoxins in the field of public food safety monitoring.",Efficient light harvesting with a nanostructured organic electron-transporting layer in perovskite solar cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31049532,Nanoscale,2019 05 17,"Nanostructures have proved to be advantageous in light harvesting, improving the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of photovoltaic devices. However, the reported light-harvesting nanostructures all require extra processing beyond that for device fabrication, with multiple steps for nano-patterned structures or plasmonic nano-particles. Here we synthesized a conjugated polymer PFPDI which could simply form a nanostructured film on perovskite by spin coating. PFPDI possesses a perylene diimide-based backbone and phosphite ester pendants, which makes it a robust electron-transporting material (ETM) in perovskite solar cells. Furthermore, the perovskite solar cells with PFPDI as the electron-transporting layer (ETL) exhibited a higher light-harvesting efficiency compared to the standard phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) devices. The JSC of the PFPDI device was enhanced from 19.71 mA cm-2 to 23.43 mA cm-2. SEM images and reflectance spectra confirmed that the PFPDI formed ditch-like nanostructures on perovskite film and induced a better light-harvesting efficiency. Further research indicated that the interaction of P[double bond, length as m-dash]O with Pb was essential to the formation of the nanostructures of PFPDI on perovskite. Therefore, our work not only offers an efficient organic ETM, but also opens up new horizons for simply constructing nanostructures with light-harvesting ability in photovoltaic devices.",Quartz crystal microbalance for telomerase sensing based on gold nanoparticle induced signal amplification.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31049531,"Chemical communications (Cambridge, England)",2019 05 23,"A novel circulating-flow quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) biosensing method has been established to detect telomerase.

We present an approach which allows for the computationally efficient calculation of exchange splittings in polynuclear lanthanide complexes including dynamical correlation. This is achieved by extending the local-density-fitted configuration-averaged Hartree-Fock (LDF-CAHF) method to systems with more than one group of open-shell orbitals (e.g. at different metal atoms) and combining it with linear-scaling many-state pair-natural-orbital complete active space perturbation theory of second order (PNO-CASPT2). In order to assess the performance of the method, we apply it to the asymmetric dinuclear complex [hqH2][Yb2(hq)4(NO3)3]·MeOH (hqH = 8-hydroxyquinoline).",Ab initio computation for solid-state 31P NMR of inorganic phosphates: revisiting X-ray structures.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31049516,Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP,2019 05 16,"The complete 31P NMR chemical shift tensors for 22 inorganic phosphates obtained from ab initio computation are found to correspond closely to experimentally obtained parameters.

We present a van der Waals p-MoTe2/n-MoTe2 homojunction p-n diode with low resistance metal contacts. Such two-dimensional homojunction devices with low contact resistance can be used in various applications in the electronics industry. The device structure consists of stacked nanoflakes of p-MoTe2 and n-MoTe2. In this investigation, we implement a deep ultraviolet light-driven doping technique in a N2 gas environment to modulate the carrier concentration in a multilayered p-MoTe2 flake, which is consequently inverted to n-MoTe2. The deep ultraviolet light-driven doping provides environmental stability in the treated devices. We use ohmic metal contacts for the homojunction p-n diode and achieve excellent gate-dependent rectifying behavior with a rectification ratio of up to 104. Contrary to heterojunctions, the ideality factor is found to be 1.05 for the zero gate bias, indicative of good interface quality at the p-MoTe2/n-MoTe2 junction, owing to low charge trapping sites at the homojunction interface. In addition, low-temperature measurements are performed to determine the barrier height for different gate biases. This study contributes to research on van der Waals homojunction p-n diodes, which show much potential for nanoelectronic and optoelectronic devices.",Kasha's rule: a reappraisal.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31049513,Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP,2019 05 16,"This work revises some anomalous cases reported in the literature, which seemingly violate Kasha's rule.

Faraday Soc., 1950, 9, 14-19): ""The emitting electronic level of a given multiplicity is the lowest excited level of that multiplicity"". Therefore, Kasha's rule focuses on the emission (photophysics) for complex molecules, in condensed phase, for the absorption of one photon per molecule under photostationary conditions, then a rapid internal conversion and a vibrational relaxation warrant that the corresponding emission comes from the first excited electronic level regardless of which electronic state of equal multiplicity is excited.",Assessment of fine particles released during paper printing and shredding processes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31049512,Environmental science. Processes & impacts,2019 05 08,"In this study, we investigated the airborne particles released during paper printing and paper shredding processes in an attempt to characterize and differentiate these particles. Particle characteristics were studied with real time instruments (RTIs) to measure concentrations and with samplers to collect particles for subsequent microscopy and cytotoxicity analysis. The particles released by paper shredding were evaluated for cytotoxicity by using in vitro human lung epithelial cell models. A substantial amount of particles were released during both the shredding and printing processes. We found that the printing process caused substantial release of particles with sizes of less than 300 nm in the form of metal granules and graphite. These released particles contained various elements including Al, Ca, Cu, Fe, Mg, N, K, P, S and Si. The particles released by the paper shredding processes were primarily nanoparticles and had a peak size between 27.4 nm and 36.5 nm. These paper particles contained elements including Al, Br Ca, Cl, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mg, N, Na, Ni P, S and Si, as determined by scanning electron microscope-energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDS) and single-particle inductively coupled plasma-mass spectroscopy (SP-ICP-MS) analysis. Although various metals were identified in the paper particles, these particles did not elicit cytotoxicity to simian virus-transformed bronchial epithelial cells (BEAS2B) and immortalized normal human bronchial epithelial cells (HBE1). However, future studies should investigate other cytotoxicity effects of these paper particles in various types of lung cells to identify potential health effects of the particles.",A flexible and conductive metallic paper-based current collector with energy storage capability in supercapacitor electrodes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31049511,"Dalton transactions (Cambridge, England : 2003)",2019 06 05,"The development of flexible current collectors as an indispensable component in energy storage devices has been in strong demand for the ever-growing market of flexible and wearable electronics. Herein, flexible and conductive paper-based current collectors are fabricated by directly depositing a metallic Ni layer composed of spiny Ni nanospheres of 400 nm diameter on the surface of filter paper via electroless deposition.

MnO2 is selected as an electrode active material to explore the role of flexible and conductive paper-based current collectors in supercapacitors. Electrochemical results reveal that the largest areal specific capacitance is 1095 mF cm-2 at 1 mA cm-2 and the excellent electrochemical performance can be attributed to the hierarchical porous fibre structure of paper and the lower contact resistance between the active material and the current collector.

The precisely designed plasmonic resonator with dual-band perfect absorption (DPA) shows strongly-enhanced nearfield intensity and polarization independence, at both resonances, providing a powerful antenna platform for the multi-band vibrational sensing. As a proof of concept, we experimentally apply the plasmonic DPAs in bond-selective dual-band infrared sensing of an ultrathin polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) film, simultaneously amplifying two representative vibrational bands (asymmetric C-H stretching of CH3 at 2962 cm-1 and CH3 deformation of Si-CH3 at 1263 cm-1) by surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (SEIRA). The plasmonic DPA was successfully adopted for the in situ monitoring of reaction kinetics, by recording the spectral changes in C-H stretching and Si-CH3 deformation modes of a 10 nm PDMS elastomer, which are selectively enhanced by the two antenna resonances, during its gelation process. Our systematic study of the SEIRA spectra has demonstrated mode splitting and a clear avoided-crossing in the dispersion curve as a function of resonance frequency of DPA, manifesting itself as a promising basis for future polaritonic devices utilizing the hybridization between the molecular vibrational states and the enhanced light field.","Approaches for the isolation and identification of hydrophilic, light-sensitive, volatile and minor natural products.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31049509,Natural product reports,2019 05 03,"Covering: up to 2019The discovery of new bioactive natural products gained momentum during the last few decades, resulting from instrumentation advances, from the expansion of genome mining and regulation, as well as by exploration of untapped biological sources.

One of the main barriers to the introduction of photo-thermal therapies (PTT) has been recognised as the inability to directly monitor the local temperature deep within the tissue at the point of therapy. Here Au nanoparticles with a Raman reporter molecule (temperature reporters) are used in combination with Au nanoshells (heat mediators) to provide simultaneously heating under NIR illumination and direct spectroscopic monitoring of local temperature deep within mammalian tissues. The surface enhanced Raman signal was read out at the tissue surface using a transmission geometry in this example and the temperature of the tissue was ascertained from the anti-Stokes to Stokes Raman reporter. This approach opens the prospect of non-invasive hyperthermia treatments with direct temperature feedback from deep inside within tissue, where nanoparticles can be used to both provide localised heating and accurately monitor the local temperature.","[Zr6O4(OH)4(benzene-1,4-dicarboxylato)6]n: a hexagonal polymorph of UiO-66.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31049494,"Chemical communications (Cambridge, England)",2019 05 23,"Since its discovery in 2008, the paradigmatic UiO-66 has behaved as the germ that has prompted the chemistry of group-4 metal based metal-organic frameworks, all of them featuring outstanding thermal and chemical stability.

Moreover, ARs treatment increased NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) signaling activation, which was evidenced by increased transcription of anti-oxidant responsive genes GCL, NQO1 and HO-1. Knockdown of Nrf2 through targeted siRNA alleviated ARs-mediated HO-1 transcription, and almost abolished ARs-mediated cytoprotection against H2O2 induced cell damage.

In this study two fast, economic and green HPLC and HPTLC methods were validated for the simultaneous determination of the three drugs. For HPLC, isocratic elution used a mixture of micellar aqueous mobile phase consisting of (0.15 M sodium lauryl sulfate and 0.01 M sodium dihydrogen phosphate, pH 6.2) and ethanol (56:44). Elution was done on RP-C18 Kinetix® column (5 μm, 150 mm × 4.6 mm ID) at flow 1 mL min-1 and 254 nm UV-detector.

However, the role of α-Klotho in the regulation of energy metabolism is complex and poorly understood. Here we investigated the effects of 5 weeks peripheral administration of α-Klotho in high fat diet induced obese mice. Food intake, blood glucose, and body weight were measured daily. Energy expenditure was determined with indirect calorimetry and body composition with magnetic resonance imaging. Liver and adipose tissue were collected for lipid content measurements and gene expression analysis. α-Klotho-treated mice experienced reduced adiposity, increased lean mass, and elevated energy expenditure, despite no changes in food intake, body weight, or fed blood glucose levels. Lipid accumulation in liver and adipose tissue was also reduced compared to controls. Furthermore, Real-time quantitative PCR showed reduced expression of key lipogenic genes in α-Klotho treated mice in these organs. Taken together, these data suggest encouraging therapeutic potential of α-Klotho and highlight a need for further research into the specific mechanisms explaining improved body composition, elevated energy expenditure, and reduced lipid content in both liver and adipose tissue in α-Klotho-treated mice.",Smallholder farmers' livelihood adaptation to climate variability and ecological changes in the savanna agro ecological zone of Ghana.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31049426,Heliyon,2019 05 05,"Climate variability and ecological changes have consequently altered life and natural livelihood-sustaining systems leading to socio-cultural, economic and environmental challenges and vulnerabilities. The risk factors are very high and the impacts will raise the developmental impediments of safeguarding livelihood security and poverty eradication in Sub-Saharan Africa. Adaptation to climate and ecological variation, though recognized as pressing and necessary, operates in the context of numerous uncertainties and unknowns. Previous studies on climate adaptation tried to identify universal patterns of coping rather than differentiating between agro ecological zones, villages and types of households. This paper uses case studies from two rural communities in the Savanna agro ecological zone of Ghana to explore smallholder farmers' responses to climate and ecological variation effects on their livelihood activities that have emerged since the mid-1980s. Results suggest that smallholder farmers use various coping, on-farm and off-farm adaptation strategies to ameliorate the negative impacts of climate and ecological changes on their livelihood. Coping measures such as selling household assets, migration of the entire households and decreasing food consumption/changing diets can be damaging. On -farm adaptation strategies such as varying planting dates, use of drought tolerant crop varieties, soil conservation strategies are based on farmers indigenous knowledge passed down from generations. To ensure sustainability of local adaptation strategies, there is the need for exchange of knowledge between and among smallholder farmers and formal institutions through the recognition and empowerment of local residents and collective actions.",Schizophrenia and Progressive Muscle Relaxation - A systematic review of effectiveness.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31049425,Heliyon,2019 05 05,"We perform a systematically search, appraise and synthesize of the best available evidence on the effectiveness of Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR) in the adults with schizophrenia, in any setting, regarding anxiety, personal and social functioning, cognition, and well-being.",Functional and pharmacological characterization of an S5 domain hERG mutation associated with short QT syndrome.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31049424,Heliyon,2019 05 05,"Congenital short QT syndrome (SQTS) is a repolarization disorder characterized by abbreviated QT intervals, atrial and ventricular arrhythmias and a risk of sudden death. This study characterized a missense mutation (I560T) in the S5 domain of the hERG K+ channel that has been associated with variant 1 of the SQTS. Whole cell patch clamp recordings of wild-type (WT) and I560T hERG current (IhERG) were made at 37 °C from hERG expressing HEK 293 cells, and the structural context of the mutation was investigated using a recently reported cryo-EM structure of hERG. Under conventional voltage clamp, the I560T mutation increased IhERG amplitude without altering the voltage-dependence of activation, although it accelerated activation time-course and also slowed deactivation time-course at some voltages. The voltage dependence of IhERG inactivation was positively shifted (by ∼24 mV) and the time-course of inactivation was slowed by the I560T mutation. There was also a modest decrease in K+ over Na+ ion selectivity with the I560T mutation. Under action potential (AP) voltage clamp, the net charge carried by hERG was significantly increased during ventricular, Purkinje fibre and atrial APs, with maximal IhERG also occurring earlier during the plateau phase of ventricular and Purkinje fibre APs. The I560T mutation exerted only a modest effect on quinidine sensitivity of IhERG: the IC50 for mutant IhERG was 2.3 fold that for WT IhERG under conventional voltage clamp. Under AP voltage clamp the inhibitory effect of 1 μM quinidine was largely retained for I560T hERG and the timing of peak I560T IhERG was altered towards that of the WT channel. In both the open channel structure and a closed hERG channel model based on the closely-related EAG structure, I560T side-chains were oriented towards membrane lipid and away from adjacent domains of the channel, contrasting with previous predictions based on homology modelling. In summary, the I560T mutation produces multiple effects on hERG channel operation that result in a gain-of-function that is expected to abbreviate ventricular, atrial and Purkinje fibre repolarization. Quinidine is likely to be of value in offsetting the increase in IhERG and altered IhERG timing during ventricular APs in SQTS with this mutation."

TNF-α inhibitors have revolutionized the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), although not all patients respond, and most relapse after treatment withdrawal. This may be due to a paradoxical exacerbation of TH17 responses by TNF-α inhibition. We examined the therapeutic potential of targeting cellular inhibitors of apoptosis 1 and 2 (cIAP1/2) in inflammation by its influence on human TH subsets and mice with collagen-induced arthritis. Inhibition of cIAP1/2 abrogated CD4+ IL-17A differentiation and IL-17 production. This was a direct effect on T cells, mediated by reducing NFATc1 expression. In mice, cIAP1/2 inhibition, when combined with etanercept, abrogated disease activity, which was associated with an increase in Tregs and was sustained after therapy retraction. We reveal an unexpected role for cIAP1/2 in regulating the balance between TH17 and Tregs and suggest that combined therapeutic inhibition could induce long-term remission in inflammatory diseases.",Entropic effects enable life at extreme temperatures.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31049402,Science advances,2019 05 05,"Maintaining membrane integrity is a challenge at extreme temperatures. Biochemical synthesis of membrane-spanning lipids is one adaptation that organisms such as thermophilic archaea have evolved to meet this challenge and preserve vital cellular function at high temperatures. The molecular-level details of how these tethered lipids affect membrane dynamics and function, however, remain unclear. Using synthetic monolayer-forming lipids with transmembrane tethers, here, we reveal that lipid tethering makes membrane permeation an entropically controlled process that helps to limit membrane leakage at elevated temperatures relative to bilayer-forming lipid membranes. All-atom molecular dynamics simulations support a view that permeation through membranes made of tethered lipids reduces the torsional entropy of the lipids and leads to tighter lipid packing, providing a molecular interpretation for the increased transition-state entropy of leakage."

This study assesses the current state of SDOH measurement across sectors by systematically identifying how many and what kinds of tools exist and whether there is consensus around SDOH categories and indicators selected. This study revealed that while numerous SDOH measurement resources exist, relatively few are tools for measuring the SDOH. Although the SDOH categories being measured could be readily summarized across tools, there was wide variation in the particular SDOH categories included in each tool. Finally, remarkably little consensus exists for the specific indicators used to measure SDOH categories. While complete consensus across tools may not be possible, learning how different sectors measure SDOH and more systematically aligning SDOH categories and indicators being measured will enable greater collaboration and deepen the impacts of place-based interventions to improve community health and well-being.",Assessing health systems in Guinea for prevention and control of priority zoonotic diseases: A One Health approach.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31049389,"One health (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",2019 05 05,"To guide One Health capacity building efforts in the Republic of Guinea in the wake of the 2014-2016 Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak, we sought to identify and assess the existing systems and structures for zoonotic disease detection and control. We partnered with the government ministries responsible for human, animal, and environmental health to identify a list of zoonotic diseases - rabies, anthrax, brucellosis, viral hemorrhagic fevers, trypanosomiasis and highly pathogenic avian influenza - as the country's top priorities. We used each priority disease as a case study to identify existing processes for prevention, surveillance, diagnosis, laboratory confirmation, reporting and response across the three ministries. Results were used to produce disease-specific systems ""maps"" emphasizing linkages across the systems, as well as opportunities for improvement. We identified brucellosis as a particularly neglected condition. Past efforts to build avian influenza capabilities, which had degraded substantially in less than a decade, highlighted the challenge of sustainability. We observed a keen interest across sectors to reinvigorate national rabies control, and given the regional and global support for One Health approaches to rabies elimination, rabies could serve as an ideal disease to test incipient One Health coordination mechanisms and procedures. Overall, we identified five major categories of gaps and challenges: (1) Coordination; (2) Training; (3) Infrastructure; (4) Public Awareness; and (5) Research. We developed and prioritized recommendations to address the gaps, estimated the level of resource investment needed, and estimated a timeline for implementation. These prioritized recommendations can be used by the Government of Guinea to plan strategically for future One Health efforts, ideally under the auspices of the national One Health Platform.

Consequently, 36 patients treated with opening wedge osteotomy of the medial cuneiform for forefoot varus were studied retrospectively. Patients were divided into two groups: the bone allograft group (HBG) (n=18) and the metallic implant group with BIOFOAM® Cotton Wedges (TTW) (n=18). Radiographic assessment and clinical scores including American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society score, Foot Function Index, and visual analogue scale for pain were collected before operation and the last follow-up. The difference between baseline and follow-up for both groups was statistically significant for all the clinical scores and radiographic angles (p < 0.05). Most participants (92%) were very satisfied after surgery. Our results showed that Cotton osteotomy with a metallic implant provided both good clinical and radiographic outcomes comparable with bone allograft.",Analysis of the Phenotypes in the Rett Networked Database.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31049350,International journal of genomics,2019 05 05,"Rett spectrum disorder is a progressive neurological disease and the most common genetic cause of intellectual disability in females. MECP2 is the major causative gene. In addition, CDKL5 and FOXG1 mutations have been reported in Rett patients, especially with the atypical presentation. Each gene and different mutations within each gene contribute to variability in clinical presentation, and several groups worldwide performed genotype-phenotype correlation studies using cohorts of patients with classic and atypical forms of Rett spectrum disorder. The Rett Networked Database is a unified registry of clinical and molecular data of Rett patients, and it is currently one of the largest Rett registries worldwide with several hundred records provided by Rett expert clinicians from 13 countries. Collected data revealed that the majority of MECP2-mutated patients present with the classic form, the majority of CDKL5-mutated patients with the early-onset seizure variant, and the majority of FOXG1-mutated patients with the congenital form. A computation of severity scores further revealed significant differences between groups of patients and correlation with mutation types. The highly detailed phenotypic information contained in the Rett Networked Database allows the grouping of patients presenting specific clinical and genetic characteristics for studies by the Rett community and beyond. These data will also serve for the development of clinical trials involving homogeneous groups of patients.",Identification and Expression Analysis of Snf2 Family Proteins in Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31049349,International journal of genomics,2019 05 05,"As part of chromatin-remodeling complexes (CRCs), sucrose nonfermenting 2 (Snf2) family proteins alter chromatin structure and nucleosome position by utilizing the energy of ATP, which allows other regulatory proteins to access DNA. Plant genomes encode a large number of Snf2 proteins, and some of them have been shown to be the key regulators at different developmental stages in Arabidopsis. Yet, little is known about the functions of Snf2 proteins in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum). In this study, 45 Snf2s were identified by the homologous search using representative sequences from yeast (S. cerevisiae), fruit fly (D. melanogaster), and Arabidopsis (A. thaliana) against the tomato genome annotation dataset. Tomato Snf2 proteins (also named SlCHRs) could be clustered into 6 groups and distributed on 11 chromosomes. All SlCHRs contained a helicase-C domain with about 80 amino acid residues and a SNF2-N domain with more variable amino acid residues. In addition, other conserved motifs were also identified in SlCHRs by using the MEME program. Expression profile analysis indicated that tomato Snf2 family genes displayed a wide range of expressions in different tissues and some of them were regulated by the environmental stimuli such as salicylic acid, abscisic acid, salt, and cold. Taken together, these results provide insights into the functions of SlCHRs in tomato.",An Undetected Case of Tinea Capitis in an Elderly Woman Affected by Dermatomyositis: How Trichoscopy Can Guide to the Right Diagnosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31049345,Skin appendage disorders,2019 05 05,"Dermatomyositis (DM) is an autoimmune disease that primarily affects the skin and muscles, but may also have a systemic involvement.

Biosensors used in wound care benefit from a chromogenic signalling due to the readiness of signal interpretation, but the most common use faint yellow chromogenic molecules such as p-nitroaniline (pNa). In addition, if to be converted into smart dressings, the colour of the detection system should not be masked by the exudate's colour. In this work, we designed a chromogenic substrate for HNE aiming to be incorporated in a smart dressing as a colour switch sensor. The substrate was developed using the GFP-like chromoprotein ultramarine (UM), following the split GFP technology. The cleavage sequence for HNE (Ala-Ala-Pro-Val) was embedded into the sensing moiety of the substrate corresponding to the 11th β-sheet. In the presence of HNE, the 11th β-sheet is able to interact to the signalling moiety composed of the β1-β10 incomplete barrel, allowing the re-establishment of the chromophore environment and, hence, the colour production. Structural homology and molecular dynamics simulations were conducted to aid on the disclosure of the structural changes that are the base of the mechanism of action of this HNE switch substrate. Our findings explore the possible application of GFP-like chromogenic sensors in point-of-care devices for the evaluation of the wounds status, representing a major step in the medical field.","Method to identify efficiently cleaved, membrane-bound, functional HIV-1 (Human Immunodeficiency Virus-1) envelopes.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31049300,MethodsX,2019 05 05,"An ideal vaccine against HIV-1 will specifically elicit bNAbs (broadly neutralizing antibodies) which can cross-neutralize a wide spectrum of circulating viral strains belonging to different clades. The current paradigm for developing such a vaccine is to generate HIV-1 envelope (Env)-based immunogens which can specifically elicit bNAbs. For this purpose, it is necessary to identify Envs, belonging to different clades, suitable for immunogen design. Efficient cleavage of the HIV-1 Env precursor gp160 polypeptide into its constituent subunits determines its ability to selectively bind to bNAbs and poorly to non-NAbs (non-neutralizing antibodies), properties desirable in Env-based immunogens. Thus, efficiently cleaved HIV-1 Envs with desirable antigenic properties can be good candidates for developing immunogens. Here we describe in detail a six step method we have used in our laboratory to identify such efficiently cleaved Envs. Some of these protocols are optimizations of previously reported assays such as FACS-based cell surface antibody binding assay, pseudovirus neutralization assay and gp120 shedding assay. Other protocols like biotinylation-neutravidin-agarose pull-down assay and plasma membrane protein immunoprecipitation assay have been developed by taking inputs from reagent/kit manufacturer's protocols and previous studies.

Design  A retrospective population-based study conducted using the National Cancer Database from 2000-2013 (NCDB). Demographics of patients presenting with stage IV thyroid cancer were compared to patients presenting with all other stages using the chi-square testing. The incidence rates were examined with the trend graphs. Results  When compared to stages I-III, there was an increased incidence of stage IV thyroid cancer in: Medicare, lower level of education, lower income, advanced age, male sex, increased number of comorbidities, further distance from a treatment facility, and medullary/anaplastic histology. The incidence of thyroid cancer increased from 7.1 per 100,000 in 2000 to 17.6 per 100,000 in 2013. During this same time period, stage IV disease increased 1 per 100,000. The increase in the incidence of thyroid cancer was almost entirely due to an increase in papillary cancer. Conclusions  The United States has continued to see a rise in the incidence of thyroid cancer over the last decade, largely due to the detection of papillary cancers. During this same time, the incidence of stage IV thyroid cancer increased as well. Because early diagnosis and treatment of an increasing number of potentially lethal cancers should lead to a decrease in metastatic disease, we suggest that the increasing incidence of thyroid cancer in the United States is due to overdiagnosis and that more aggressive disease is not being removed by early detection.",Pediatric Traumas and Paradigm Shifts: The Necessary Adaption of the Steerable Microcatheter in Pediatric Interventional Radiology.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31049274,Cureus,2019 05 05,"The use of traditionally available intra-arterial devices have historically been designed with the adult patient population in mind.

Working with community leaders to design and facilitate the intervention not only provided IPV education within the context of the community, but also led to sustainable efforts to enhance the safety and wellbeing of women experiencing violence.",Staphylococcus aureus Antibiotic Susceptibilities in Infections in an Outpatient Dermatology Office on O'ahu.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31049265,Hawai'i journal of medicine & public health : a journal of Asia Pacific Medicine & Public Health,2019 05 05,"Staphylococcus aureus is a pathogen that causes skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) in dermatology patients. There is an increasing rate of methicillin-resistant S aureus (MRSA) reported in the dermatology literature since 1987. This report profiles the antibiotic susceptibilities of methicillin-sensitive S aureus (MSSA) and MRSA in an outpatient office in Hawai'i. This is a retrospective study done by chart review from 2012 to 2014. Demographics, anatomical site of infection, clinical diagnoses and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns were analyzed and compared. Of the 66 samples, 57% were males and 43% were females. S aureus was more commonly found in impetigo, folliculitis, furuncles and secondarily infected psoriasis and more commonly located on the extremities. MSSA accounted for 73% (48) of the cases and MRSA accounted for 27% (18) of the cases. The antibiotics most effective against all S aureus cultures for outpatients were linezolid (100%), trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole (95%) and tetracyclines (94%). Linezolid (100%), trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole (100%) were most effective against MRSA isolates. Our S aureus and MRSA antimicrobial susceptibility results are similar to the local Hawai'i outpatient antibiogram collected from a large private laboratory in Hawai'i in 2014 and the current Infectious Disease Society of America guidelines. This study may be helpful in guiding empiric treatment of SSTIs suspected to be caused by S aureus.",Hawai'i Concussion Awareness & Management Program (HCAMP): Impact.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31049264,Hawai'i journal of medicine & public health : a journal of Asia Pacific Medicine & Public Health,2019 05 05,"Concussion, also referred to as mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), is caused by a direct or indirect blow to the head or body causing the brain to move rapidly within the skull, resulting in immediate, but temporary, brain dysfunction. Developing awareness and promoting concussion education can reduce the number of short and long-term injuries associated with sports and non-sports related concussions in Hawai'i. The purpose of this study was two-fold: (1) to describe the number of concussions in 67 Hawai'i high school athletic programs using the ImPACT database; and (2) to describe which contact and collision sports had the highest rate of concussions in 67 Hawai'i high schools. This was a retrospective study that described the number of concussions generated across school years 2010-2016, concussion data across 14 contact sports, and athletic exposure rating for the 14 contact sports. Data were analyzed and aggregated from a data-bank associated with the Hawai'i Concussion Awareness and Management program. Findings suggest that for Hawai'i high school student athletes' concussions increased from 2010-2013 with a gradual decrease from 2014-2016, specific sports had higher number of concussions (eg, football), and when evaluating concussion rate per 1000 exposures, girls' judo was the highest. These findings stress the need for continued data collection, monitoring, education/awareness and research that will reduce the number of concussions among student athletes.",Intranasal Corticosteroids and Central Serous Chorioretinopathy: A Report and Review of the Literature.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31049263,Hawai'i journal of medicine & public health : a journal of Asia Pacific Medicine & Public Health,2019 05 05,"A 43-year-old male with a history of allergic rhinitis on chronic intranasal corticosteroids presented with complaints of a ""black band"" in his right eye visual field.

In the present study, an efficient and sensitive analytical method based on high-performance anion exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection (HPAEC-PAD) was established for the simultaneous separation and determination of D-glucose and ß-1,3-linked COS ranging from (COS)2 to (COS)6 within 20 min. Detection limits were 0.01 to 0.03 mg/L. The optimized assay was performed on a CarboPac-PA100 analytical column (4 mm × 250 mm) using isocratic elution with water-0.2 M sodium hydroxide-0.5 M sodium acetate mixture (50 : 30 : 20, v/v/v) as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 0.8 mL/min. Regression equations indicated a good linear relationship (R2 = 0.9992-1.0000, n = 6) within the test ranges. Quality parameters including precision and accuracy were fully validated and found to be satisfactory. More important, the regression of natural logarithm values of retention times (log10 RT) versus the degree polymerization (DP), as well as the slope coefficient of each COS's linear equation versus the corresponding DP, fitted a linear relationship well. These inherent linear relationships could provide valuable information to tentatively identify and quantify the COS even with the DP more than 6 without authentic standard. Furthermore, when the log10 RT was plotted against log10 flow rate for each COS, a perfect linear relationship was also observed.",The Status of Assessments and Treatments for Osteoporosis in Patients 5 Years after Total Hip Arthroplasty: A Cross-Sectional Survey of 194 Post-THA Patients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31049227,Advances in orthopedics,2019 05 05,"Assessments for osteoporosis in patients who have undergone total hip arthroplasty (THA) are very important with respect to the clinical results.

Moreover, we aimed to determine the educational effectiveness of the cricothyrotomy practicum in anesthesiology. Before the lecture and without prior notification, 119 students were provided with a photograph of a man's neck and instructed to attach a blue sticker to the cricothyrotomy puncture site and to a palpable tracheotomy trainer, after applying sufficient palpation. After this, students attended a 60-min lecture on the emergency airway management method. Two and 16 days after the lecture and practicum, students were presented with a new neck photograph and the tracheotomy trainer and asked again to place stickers (red stickers: at 2 days; green stickers: at 16 days) on the cricothyrotomy penetration site. The data were analyzed with an image processing software, by superimposing the 119 stickers on the neck photographs and tracheotomy trainers, to visually examine the accuracy of CTM identification. The rate of correct sticker placement in the neck photographs was 41.2% before the lecture, 80.7% 2 days after the lecture, and 77.3% 16 days after the lecture (before vs. 2 and 16 days after, p value < 0.01). For the tracheotomy trainer, the rate was 36.1% before the lecture, 97.5% 2 days after the lecture, and 94.1% 16 days after the lecture (before vs. 2 and 16 days after, p value < 0.01). Furthermore, the proportion of students with mistakes above and below the CTM was higher than that of students with mistakes to the right or left. In conclusion, the rate of accurate CTM identification among dental students was low before they underwent the relevant practicum, but most students were able to identify the CTM accurately after the lecture and practicum in a small class.",Expression and role of regulator of G-protein signaling 5 in squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31049219,Clinical and experimental dental research,2019 05 05,"Regulator of G-protein signaling (RGS) 5 acts as a GTPase-activating protein to negatively regulate G-protein signaling. RGS5 is reportedly related to the invasion and metastasis of cancers, such as nonsmall lung cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma. We examined RGS5 expression and its relationship with invasion in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the tongue. For immunohistochemical analysis of RGS5, we used SCC tissues of the tongue obtained from 43 patients. We examined the relationship between RGS5 expression in the deepest point of invasion and clinicopathological features. Because the invasion and metastasis of cancers are related to epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), we carried out staining for N-cadherin, vimentin, and E-cadherin to examine the relationship between EMT and RGS5. RGS5 expression in the deepest point of invasion in SCC of the tongue was observed in 32 cases (75%). Immunohistochemical analysis revealed a significant correlation between RGS5 expression in the aggressive invasion pattern, invasion depth, and lymphovascular invasion. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that high RGS5 expression was associated with postoperative early lymph node metastasis. Further, a significant positive correlation was observed between RGS5 and N-cadherin (P = 0.0003) and vimentin (P < 0.0001). In contrast, E-cadherin and RGS5 or vimentin were significantly negatively correlated (P < 0.0001-0.005). The findings indicate that RGS5 expression is related to tumor invasion and EMT in SCC of the tongue and that RGS5 may predict postoperative early lymph node metastasis. Therefore, RGS5 may be a useful prognostic biomarker of the surgically resected SCC and a potential target of molecular therapy for treating SCC of the tongue.",Traumatic dental injuries in preschool-age children: Prevalence and risk factors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31049218,Clinical and experimental dental research,2019 05 05,"This study examined the prevalence, socio-demographic correlates, and clinical predictors of traumatic dental injuries (TDIs) in the primary dentition among a community-based sample of preschool-age children. The sample comprised 1,546 preschool-age children (mean age 49 [range: 24-71] months) in North Carolina public preschools, enrolled in a population-based investigation among young children and their parents in North Carolina. Information on socio-demographic, extraoral, and intraoral characteristics was collected and analyzed with bivariate and multivariate methods, including logistic regression modeling and marginal effects estimation. The prevalence of dental trauma was 47% and 8% of TDI cases were ""severe"" (pulp exposure, tooth displacement, discolored or necrotic tooth, or tooth loss). In bivariate analyses, overjet and lip incompetence were significantly associated with TDI. Overjet remained positively associated with severe trauma in multivariate analysis, OR = 1.4, 95% confidence interval (CI) [1.2, 1.6], corresponding to an absolute 1.3%, 95% CI [0.7, 1.8], increase in the likelihood of severe trauma, per millimeter of overjet. Children with increased overjet (>3 mm) were 3.8, 95% CI [2.0, 7.4], times as likely to have experienced severe TDI compared with those with ≤3 mm. Overjet is a strong risk factor for TDIs in the primary dentition. Incorporating and operationalizing this information may help TDI prevention and related anticipatory guidance for families of preschool-age children.","Dental professionals' experience with and handling of suspicion of child maltreatment in a small-scale society, the Faroe Islands.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31049217,Clinical and experimental dental research,2019 05 05,"The aims of the present study were to describe how frequently dental professionals in a small-scale society like the Faroese Islands, experience suspicion on child maltreatment, and how they handle their suspicion. Furthermore, we wanted to investigate the hypothesis that the special interpersonal characteristics of small-scale societies like the Faroese, influence how dental professionals handle suspicion of child maltreatment compared to how their colleagues in larger societies handled such suspicion. The design of our study was cross-sectional using a non-probability purposive sampling method. A translated and slightly modified version of the Danish questionnaire regarding suspicion on child maltreatment was sent to all 71 dental professionals (44 dentists and 27 dental hygienists) in the Faroe Islands. 51 (72%) returned a valid questionnaire. Of these, 61% experienced suspicion of child maltreatment at some point in their career, 33% within the last 6 months, and 10% percent were certain of child maltreatment during the last six months. Of those respondents who had experienced suspicion at some point of their career, 39% had reported their suspicion. The main reasons for withholding a suspicion were: uncertainty as to whether the suspicion was reliable, fear of the consequences for the child, and lack of procedural knowledge. Faroese dental professionals suspected child maltreatment much more frequently (61%) than their Danish (38%), Scottish (29%), and Croatian colleagues (26%) did. Child maltreatment raises concern among the Faroese dental professionals more frequently than among their colleagues in larger societies. They also seem to report their concern more frequently than their Scottish colleagues do. Thus, the present study indicates that the social structure in small-scale societies may affect dental professionals' suspicions, and handling of child maltreatment.",Morphological variation in the anterior cranial fossa.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31049216,Clinical and experimental dental research,2019 05 05,"The anterior cranial fossa is an important anatomical landmark in clinical orthodontics consisting of the frontal, ethmoid, and sphenoid bones.

The purposes of the present study were to describe the morphological relationships among the three bones and to discuss the factors contributing to individual variations in adult skulls based on postnatal development. Skulls of 100 Indian adults and 18 Japanese juveniles were observed both macroscopically and using computed tomography images in the median sagittal plane. Three types of relationship were seen among the three bones in adult skulls: (a) a triangular border between ethmoid and sphenoid bones (ethmoid spine), (b) a straight or concave border between ethmoid and sphenoid bones, and (c) frontal bone lying between the ethmoid and sphenoid bones. In the juvenile skull, structures corresponding to those in adults were observed. These three bones comprise the anterior cranial base, each with differing developmental processes, and slight differences in these processes seem to be reflected in the morphological variations seen among adults."

Carbohydrates serve as the main source of energy in diets fed to pigs. Carbohydrates may be classified according to their degree of polymerization: monosaccharides, disaccharides, oligosaccharides, and polysaccharides. Digestible carbohydrates include sugars, digestible starch, and glycogen that may be digested by enzymes secreted in the gastrointestinal tract of the pig. Non-digestible carbohydrates, also known as fiber, may be fermented by microbial populations along the gastrointestinal tract to synthesize short-chain fatty acids that may be absorbed and metabolized by the pig. These non-digestible carbohydrates include two disaccharides, oligosaccharides, resistant starch, and non-starch polysaccharides. The concentration and structure of non-digestible carbohydrates in diets fed to pigs depend on the type of feed ingredients that are included in the mixed diet. Cellulose, arabinoxylans, and mixed linked β-(1,3) (1,4)-d-glucans are the main cell wall polysaccharides in cereal grains, but vary in proportion and structure depending on the grain and tissue within the grain. Cell walls of oilseeds, oilseed meals, and pulse crops contain cellulose, pectic polysaccharides, lignin, and xyloglucans. Pulse crops and legumes also contain significant quantities of galacto-oligosaccharides including raffinose, stachyose, and verbascose. Overall, understanding the structure, characteristics and measurable chemical properties of fiber in feed ingredients may result in more accurate diet formulations, resulting in an improvement in the utilization of energy from less expensive high-fiber ingredients and a reduction in reliance on energy from more costly cereal grains.",Analyses of circRNA profiling during the development from pre-receptive to receptive phases in the goat endometrium.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31049198,Journal of animal science and biotechnology,2019 05 05,Recent studies have revealed that noncoding RNAs play important regulatory roles in the formation of endometrial receptivity.

Letters,2019 05 05,"We report the identification of 19 presolar oxide grains from the Orgueil CI meteorite with substantial enrichments in 54Cr, with 54Cr/52Cr ratios ranging from 1.2 to 56 times the solar value. The most enriched grains also exhibit enrichments at mass 50, most likely due in part to 50Ti, but close-to-normal or depleted 53Cr/52Cr ratios. There is a strong inverse relationship between 54Cr enrichment and grain size; the most extreme grains are all <80 nm in diameter. Comparison of the isotopic data with predictions of nucleosynthesis calculations indicate that these grains most likely originated in either rare, high-density Type Ia supernovae (SNIa), or in electron-capture supernovae (ECSN) which may occur as the end stage of evolution for stars of mass 8-10 M⊙. This is the first evidence for preserved presolar grains from either type of supernova. An ECSN origin is attractive since these likely occur much more frequently than high-density SNIa, and their evolutionary timescales (~20 Myr) are comparable to those of molecular clouds. Self-pollution of the Sun's parent cloud from an ECSN may explain the heterogeneous distribution of n-rich isotopic anomalies in planetary materials, including a recently reported dichotomy in Mo isotopes in the solar system. The stellar origins of three grains with solar 54Cr/52Cr, but anomalies in 50Cr or 53Cr, as well as of a grain enriched in 57Fe, are unclear.",Experimental and theoretical investigation of overall energy deposition in surface-induced unfolding of protein ions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31049192,Chemical science,2019 05 05,"Recent advances in native mass spectrometry have enabled its use to probe the structure of and interactions within biomolecular complexes. Surface-induced dissociation, in which inter- and intramolecular interactions are disrupted following an energetic ion-surface collision, is a method that can directly interrogate the topology of protein complexes. However, a quantitative relationship between the ion kinetic energy at the moment of surface collision and the internal energy deposited into the ion has not yet been established for proteins. The factors affecting energy deposition in surface-induced unfolding (SIU) of protein monomers were investigated and a calibration relating laboratory-frame kinetic energy to internal energy developed. Protein monomers were unfolded by SIU and by collision-induced unfolding (CIU). CIU and SIU cause proteins to undergo the same unfolding transitions at different values of laboratory-frame kinetic energy. There is a strong correlation between the SIU and CIU energies, demonstrating that SIU, like CIU, can largely be understood as a thermal process. The change in internal energy in CIU was modeled using a Monte Carlo approach and theory. Computed values of the overall efficiency were found to be approximately 25% and used to rescale the CIU energy axis and relate nominal SIU energies to internal energy. The energy deposition efficiency in SIU increases with mass and kinetic energy from a low of ∼20% to a high of ∼68%, indicating that the effective mass of the surface increases along with the mass of the ion. The effect of ion structure on energy deposition was probed using multiple stages of ion activation. Energy deposition in SIU strongly depends on structure, decreasing as the protein is elongated, due to decreased effective protein-surface collisional cross section and increased transfer to rotational modes.",Aminoazobenzene@Ag modified meshes with large extent photo-response: towards reversible oil/water removal from oil/water mixtures.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31049191,Chemical science,2019 05 05,"Photo-responsive materials with superwetting properties, especially in the azo-based class, have been used in water treatment because of their smart performance on wettability changes. However, their transformation extent in wettability has always troubled researchers. Here, we modified nano-Ag pine needles and aminoazobenzene (AABN) on polydopamine (PDA) pre-treated porous meshes, realizing a large-extent reversible photo-responsive wettability transformation from highly hydrophobic to highly hydrophilic. The contact angle is about 150.0° after being exposed to visible light, and is about 10.0° under 365 nm UV light. Accordingly, the modified mesh can achieve photo-responsive removal between oil and water from oil/water mixtures. This facile and universal approach based on trans-cis isomerization of AABN could be endowed to various commercial conductive meshes. Moreover, the modified meshes exhibit satisfactory removal efficiency, reusability and physical/chemical stability, which are more promising for practical applications such as fuel recycling, remote controlled oil/water separation and astronautical resource regeneration.",Translocation of enzymes into a mesoporous MOF for enhanced catalytic activity under extreme conditions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31049190,Chemical science,2019 05 05,"Enzymatic catalysis is of great importance to the chemical industry. However, we are still scratching the surface of the potential of biocatalysis due to the limited operating range of enzymes in harsh environments or their low recyclability. The role of Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs) as active supports to help overcome these limitations, mainly by immobilization and stabilization of enzymes, is rapidly expanding. Here we make use of mild heating and a non-polar medium during incubation to induce the translocation of a small enzyme like protease in the mesoporous MOF MIL-101(Al)-NH2. Our proteolytic tests demonstrate that protease@MIL-101(Al)-NH2 displays higher activity than the free enzyme under all the conditions explored and, more importantly, its usability can be extended to extreme conditions of pH and high temperatures. MOF immobilization is also effective in providing the biocomposite with long-term stability, recyclability and excellent compatibility with competing enzymes. This simple, one-step infiltration strategy might accelerate the discovery of new MOF-enzyme biocatalysts that meet the requirements for biotechnological applications."

The aim of this report is to assess the major complications of colonoscopies performed by one expert gastroenterologist and their management in Tehran Iran. METHODS We have recoded the rates of adverse events and their management in all the colonoscopies performed by a single expert gastroenterologist during 23 years (1994-2017). Demographic factors including age, race, and sex, and colonoscopy findings and patients' comorbidities were recorded. RESULTS During 23 years, 9012 colonoscopies and about 1700 polypectomies were performed. The number of serious complications was six (0.07%). Colonic perforation occurred in five patients (0.06%); three of whom had undergone polypectomies. All cases of colonic perforation were managed by surgery and all were discharged with no complications. One patient suffered from cardiac arrest just after colonoscopy in the recovery room and died 20 days after colonoscopy (0.01%). CONCLUSION Although the rate of adverse events after colonoscopy was low, it is still an important concern in developing screening recommendations in low and middle-income countries.",Incidental Gall Bladder Adenocarcinoma in Cholecystectomy Specimens; A Single Center Experience and Review of the Literature.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31049173,Middle East journal of digestive diseases,2019 05 05,"BACKGROUND Gallbladder adenocarcinoma is the most common malignant tumor of the biliary tract. Most of gall bladder cancers are detected incidentally only after pathological examination of the surgical specimens. In this study we investigated the characteristics of incidental gallbladder cancers in our center and also reviewed the current literature regarding the diagnosis and treatment of such incidentally detected tumors in the gall bladder. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed all of the cholecystectomy specimens in the archives of Pathology Department in the hospitals affiliated to Shiraz University of Medical Sciences in the study period (2010-2016). Clinicopathological characteristics were extracted from the patients' clinical charts, which included symptoms, radiological findings, laboratory data, and surgical procedures as well as outcome. RESULTS During these 7 years we identified 18 cases of incidental gall bladder cancer, consisted of 13 women and 5 men with the age range of 32 to 85 (62.5 ± 14.2) years detected after pathological study of the resected gall bladders among more than 4800 resected gall bladders. During the period, only two patients were operated on with the impression of gall bladder adenocarcinoma, which was not included in the study. Ten cases were T1 and eight were T2 at the time of surgery. They have been followed up for 1-7 years, during which, six cases of T2 died. All of the T1 cases are alive and symptom free. CONCLUSION By increasing laparoscopic cholecystectomies in our center we observed 0.37% incidental cases of gall bladder adenocarcinoma. Preoperative diagnosis of this cancer in early stages is very difficult and needs high degree of suspicion. The most important predictor of prognosis is the stage of the cancer at the time of surgery. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of incidental gall bladder cancer from Iran.","Comparison of Levofloxacin-Based, 10-day Sequential Therapy with 14-day Quadruple Therapy for Helicobacter Pylori Eradication: A Randomized Clinical Trial.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31049172,Middle East journal of digestive diseases,2019 05 05,"BACKGROUND Considering the importance of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) eradication, this clinical trial was designed to prospectively evaluate the efficacy of levofloxacin-based, sequential therapy in comparison with quadruple therapy for eradicating H. pylori. METHODS Overall 156 patients with dyspepsia and H. pylori infection were included in this study and were randomly allocated to either 10-day sequential therapy group (group A) to receive pantoprazole (40 mg twice daily), amoxicillin (1 gr twice daily), levofloxacin (500 mg twice daily), and tinidazole (500 mg twice daily) (PALT) or 14-day quadruple therapy group (group B) to receive pantoprazole, clarithromycin, bismuth subcitrate, and amoxicillin (PABC). At the end of the study the eradication rate in each group was assessed by urea breath test (UBT). RESULTS Age range of the participants was 18-65 years (average 36.9 years) and 50% of them (78 patients) were men. 78 patients were allocated to group A and 78 patients to groupe B. After antibiotic therapy, all the patients received acid suppression therapy with Proton Pump Inhibitor (PPI) for 4 weeks and then the eradication rate was confirmed by UBT (Heli FAN plus 13C, Germany). Before performing UBT, all the participants were requested to halt consumption of PPI for at least 1 week. During the treatment there was not any major complication but in group A (sequential therapy), two patients complained of minor complications including musculoskeletal pain. None of the patients in group B had any complaint or side effect. The rate of H. pylori eradication in group A was 78.2% (61 patients) while this rate in group B was 83.3% (65 patients) with no significant difference between the two groups (p = 0.42). In subgroup analysis, the rate of eradication among men in group A and B were 76.9% and 89.7%, respectively (p = 0.22) while the eradication rate among women were 79.4% and 76.9%, respectively (p = 1.00). CONCLUSION It seems that levofloxacin base sequential therapy does not have any advantage in comparison with quadruple regimen and until finding any more effective short course therapy for H. Pylori eradication; we encourage quadruple regimen to be used as the first line therapy.",Comparison of Oral versus Intravenous Proton Pump Inhibitors in Preventing Re-bleeding from Peptic Ulcer after Successful Endoscopic Therapy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31049171,Middle East journal of digestive diseases,2019 05 05,"BACKGROUND Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are now widely prescribed for the management of patients with acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding; although its optimal dose and route of administration has remained a controversial issue. The aim of this study was to assess the clinical effectiveness of high dose oral versus intravenous (IV) PPI after successful endoscopic therapy in patients with bleeding peptic ulcer disease. METHODS 178 patients with active upper gastrointestinal bleeding due to a peptic ulcer with stigmata of high risk for re-bleeding entered the study. After successful endoscopic hemostasis, they were randomized to receive either high dose oral pantoprazole (80 mg stat and 80 mg twice daily for 3 days) or high dose intravenous pantoprazole (80 mg IV infusion within 30 minutes and 8 mg per hour for 3 days). After the 3rd day, the patients in both groups received oral pantoprazole 40 mg twice daily for one month. The end points were comparing the rate of re-bleeding or mortality, and the need for blood transfusion or surgery during the first month between the two groups. RESULTS There were not significant statistical differences between the two groups in the volume of blood transfusion, mean duration of hospital stay, need to surgery, or mortality rates. However, the rates of re-bleeding were 2.3% (2:88) in the IV group and 3.3% (3:90) in the oral group (p = 0.6). CONCLUSION According to our findings, it seems that high dose oral PPI can be a good alternative to high dose IV PPI in patients with bleeding peptic ulcer who are at high risk of re-bleeding. Due to the lower cost and the availability of oral PPIs, their use can be economically much more affordable.",Detection of Minimal Hepatic Encephalopathy in Iranian Patients with Cirrhosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31049170,Middle East journal of digestive diseases,2019 05 05,BACKGROUND Minimal hepatic encephalopathy (MHE) is the mildest type of hepatic encephalopathy in patients with cirrhosis. Patients with MHE have normal clinical and physical examination but they show some neurocognitive dysfunctions that affect their quality of life negatively. The aim of the current study is to diagnose MHE in patients with cirrhosis and its associated factors. METHODS This is a cross-sectional study on 120 known cases of cirrhosis referred to hospitals affiliated to Isfahan University of Medical Sciences during 2014-17. The patients' cirrhosis severity was evaluated using laboratory tests and physical examinations based on MELD (Model for End-stage Liver Disease) and Child-Pugh criteria. The patients' demographics were filled in a checklist. All included patients with cirrhosis were asked to respond to the questions of Psychometric Hepatic Encephalopathy Score (PHES) test. RESULTS Mean age of the patients was 51.2 ± 9.7 years. 62 (51.7%) patients were men and 58 (48.3%) patients were women. The mean score of the patients based on MELD criteria was 14.03 ± 6.09. 26.7% of the patients presented MHE. Mean age of the patients with MHE was statistically less than the patients without MHE (p value < 0.001). Mean score of MELD criteria among the patients with diagnosis of MHE was significantly higher than the other group (p value < 0.001). The patients' Child class was statistically associated with MHE (p value < 0.001). Men were significantly more affected than women (p value = 0.03). CONCLUSION MHE was associated with MELD score and Child class of the patients with cirrhosis. The noticeable point was reversible association of age with MHE. Further studies are recommended.,Outcome of Cytomegalovirus Colitis in Inflammatory Bowel Disease with Different Regimes of Ganciclovir.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31049169,Middle East journal of digestive diseases,2019 05 05,"BACKGROUND Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is common in individuals with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and is responsible for relapse, increased severity, and poor outcome if left untreated. Ganciclovir is the mainstay of treatment but data regarding its use, mode of administration, and duration of treatment is poorly described. We reviewed the practice of treating CMV colitis with different regimes of ganciclovir at a district NHS hospital to compare the clinical outcome. METHODS 35 patients with IBD and concurrent diagnosis of CMV infection were evaluated. The parameters studied were clinical outcome in term of clinical response, length of hospital stay, readmission, or colectomy with three different regimes of ganciclovir, in addition to treatment for IBD. RESULTS 35 patients with IBD (ulcerative colitis = 23, Crohn's disease = 5, Indeterminate colitis = 7) and positive diagnosis of CMV infection were studied. Clinical outcome with two weeks of intravenous (IV) ganciclovir regime was superior than one week of IV ganciclovir and two weeks of oral Valganciclovir in term of clinical response on day 15 (95.8% vs 74%, 24.3%, respectively p = 0.45) and colectomy rate within 3 months (6.25% vs 27.3%, vs 25%, respectively). CONCLUSION CMV colitis is associated with poor outcome in patient with IBD if left untreated. 2 weeks IV ganciclovir was associated with a better outcome than 1 week of IV treatment or oral treatment.",Role of MicroRNAs in Pathophysiology of Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease and Non-alcoholic Steatohepatitis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31049168,Middle East journal of digestive diseases,2019 05 05,"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common liver disorder worldwide. It includes wide range of diseases from different subtypes of simple steatosis to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which may be complicated by liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, or hepatocellular carcinoma.

MiRNAs are short non-coding RNAs of 22-23 nucleotides in length, which regulate a large number of genes that have a critical role in regulation of lipid and cholesterol biosynthesis in hepatocytes. MiRNAs can be used as a very powerful biomarker to diagnosis and follow-up any disorder, such as NAFLD and NASH with a high specificity and sensitivity. The aim of this study was to review the role of different miRNAs in the pathophysiology of NASH and NAFLD.",Gut Microbiota and Fecal Metabolome Perturbation in Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31049167,Middle East journal of digestive diseases,2019 05 05,"The brain-intestinal axis concept describes the communication between the intestinal microbiota as an ecosystem of a number of dynamic microorganisms and the brain.

However, there is an evolving appreciation that this lipoprotein class is highly heterogeneous with regard to composition and functionality. With the advent of advanced lipid-testing techniques and methods that allow both the quantitation and recovery of individual particle populations, we are beginning to connect the functionality of HDL subspecies with chronic metabolic diseases. In this review, we examine type 2 diabetes (T2D) and explore our current understanding of how obesity, insulin resistance, and hyperglycemia affect, and may be affected by, HDL subspeciation. We discuss mechanistic aspects of how insulin resistance may alter lipoprotein profiles and how this may impact the ability of HDL to mitigate both atherosclerotic disease and diabetes itself. Finally, we call for more detailed studies examining the impact of T2D on specific HDL subspecies and their functions. If these particles can be isolated and their compositions and functions fully elucidated, it may become possible to manipulate the levels of these specific particles or target the protective functions to reduce the incidence of coronary heart disease.",Revisiting Reverse Cholesterol Transport in the Context of High-Density Lipoprotein Free Cholesterol Bioavailability.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31049149,Methodist DeBakey cardiovascular journal,2019 06 13,"Dysregulated free cholesterol (FC) metabolism has been implicated in nearly all stages of atherosclerosis, the underlying cause of most cardiovascular disease. According to a widely cited model, the burden of macrophage FC in the arterial wall is relieved by transhepatic reverse cholesterol transport (RCT), which comprises three successive steps: (1) macrophage FC efflux to high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and/or its major protein, apolipoprotein AI; (2) FC esterification by lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT); and (3) HDL-cholesteryl ester (CE) uptake via the hepatic HDL-receptor, scavenger receptor class B type 1 (SR-B1). Recent studies have challenged the validity of this model, most notably the role of LCAT, which appears to be of minor importance. In mice, most macrophage-derived FC is rapidly cleared from plasma (t1/2 < 5 min) without esterification by hepatic uptake; the remainder is taken up by multiple tissue and cell types, especially erythrocytes. Further, some FC is cleared by the nonhepatic transintestinal pathway. Lastly, FC movement among lipid surfaces is reversible, so that a higher-than-normal level of HDL-FC bioavailability-defined by high plasma HDL levels concurrent with a high mol% HDL-FC-leads to the transfer of excess FC to cells in vivo. SR-B1-/- mice provide an animal model to study the mechanistic consequences of high HDL-FC bioavailability that provokes atherosclerosis and other metabolic abnormalities. Future efforts should aim to reduce HDL-FC bioavailability, thereby reducing FC accretion by tissues and the attendant atherosclerosis.",Statins: Then and Now.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31049146,Methodist DeBakey cardiovascular journal,2019 06 13,"The discovery of statins (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase inhibitors) is a consequence of the highly targeted, arduous search for naturally occurring compounds that inhibit cholesterol biosynthesis. An enormous amount of basic scientific, genetic, and clinical research substantiated the role of lipoprotein-derived cholesterol in atherogenesis. Quantifying the impact of lipid lowering on cardiovascular event rates became an issue of utmost urgency. Although a variety of nonstatin drugs had been tested in clinical trials, they found limited utility in the clinical setting due to lack of mortality reduction or tolerability issues. As multiple prospective randomized statin trials began publishing their results, it became clear that reducing atherogenic lipoprotein burden with these drugs was highly efficacious, safe, and generally well tolerated. Statins have been shown to reduce risk for nonfatal MI, ischemic stroke, need for revascularization, and cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. They have also been shown to stabilize and even regress established atherosclerotic plaque. For the first 2 decades of their use, statin dosing was largely determined by risk-stratified low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) goals. More recently, there has been a transition away from LDL-C goal attainment with a focus more on cardiovascular risk and percent LDL-C reduction. Unfortunately, long-term adherence rates with statin therapy remain low and, even when used, they tend to be underdosed.",How Much Do Lipid Guidelines Help the Clinician?

Of all the plasma lipids, cholesterol is distinctive because it is a precursor to steroidogenic molecules, some of which regulate metabolism, and its blood concentration in the form of low- and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) are positive and negative risk factors for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). New research, however, has challenged the widely held belief that high HDL-C levels are atheroprotective and is showing that both low and high plasma HDL-C levels confer an increased risk of ASCVD. Furthermore, it is disputing the widely cited mechanism involved in reverse cholesterol transport. This review explores the evolution of cholesterol research starting with the Gofman and Framingham studies, the development of traditional and emerging lipid-lowering therapies, and the role of reverse cholesterol transport in HDL cardioprotection.",Supplementing Genistein for Breeder Hens Alters the Fatty Acid Metabolism and Growth Performance of Offsprings by Epigenetic Modification.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31049141,Oxidative medicine and cellular longevity,2019 05 05,"The experiment was designed to clarify the effect and molecular mechanism of maternal genistein (GEN) on the lipid metabolism and developmental growth of offspring chicks. Laying broiler breeder (LBB) hens were supplemented with 40 mg/kg genistein (GEN), while the control group was fed with the low-soybean meal diet. The offspring chicks were grouped according to the mother generation with 8 replicates each. Hepatic transcriptome data revealed 3915 differentially expressed genes (DEGs, P adjusted < 0.05, fold change > 1.5 or fold change < 0.67) between chicks in the two groups. Maternal GEN activated the GH-IGF1-PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, which promoted the developmental processes and cellular amino acid metabolic processes, as well as inhibited the apoptotic process. GEN treatment significantly increased the weight gain, breast muscle percentage, and liver index in chicks. PANTHER clustering analysis suggested that maternal GEN enhanced the antioxidant activity of chicks by the upregulation of gene (SOD3, MT1, and MT4) expression. Accordingly, the activities of T-AOC and T-SOD in the liver were increased after GEN treatment. The overrepresentation tests revealed that maternal GEN influenced the glycolysis, unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis, acyl-coenzyme A metabolism, lipid transport, and cholesterol metabolism in the chick livers. Hepatic cholesterol and long-chain fatty acid were significantly decreased after GEN treatment. However, the level of arachidonic acid was higher in the livers of the GEN-treated group compared with the CON group. Moreover, GEN treatment enhanced fatty acid β-oxidation and upregulated PPARδ expression in the chick liver. ChIP-qPCR analysis indicated that maternal GEN might induce histone H3-K36 trimethylation in the promoter region of PPARδ gene (PPARD) through Iws1, methyltransferases. It also induced histone H4-K12 acetylation at the PPARD promoter through MYST2, which activated the PPAR signaling pathways in the chick livers. In summary, supplementing LBB hens with GEN can alter lipid metabolism in the offspring chicks through epigenetic modification and improve the antioxidative capability as well as growth performance.",Cordyceps militaris Improves Chronic Kidney Disease by Affecting TLR4/NF-κB Redox Signaling Pathway.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31049139,Oxidative medicine and cellular longevity,2019 05 05,"Cordyceps militaris may show good promise in protecting against chronic kidney disease (CKD) but the molecular mechanism remains unclear. CKD risk is associated with the Toll-like receptor 4/nuclear factor-kappa B (TLR4/NF-κB) signaling pathway. Cordycepin is the main component of Cordyceps militaris and may affect the TLR4/NF-κB pathway. Cordycepin was prepared by preparative HPLC. CKD patients were assigned into Cordyceps militaris (COG, 100 mg daily) and placebo (CG) groups. Cordycepin activity was measured using human embryo kidney cells (HEK293T). Biochemical indices, the levels of TLR4, NF-κB, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), were measured by real-time qRT-PCR, or ELISA kits and or Western blot. After 3-month treatment, cordycepin reduced the levels of urinal protein, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and creatinine by 36.7%±8.6%, 12.5%±3.2%, and 18.3%±6.6%, respectively (P < 0.05). Cordyceps militaris improved lipid profile and redox capacity of CKD patients by reducing the serum levels of TG, TC, and LDL-C by 12.8%±3.6%, 15.7%±4.1%, and 16.5%±4.4% and increasing the HDL-C level by 10.1%±1.4% in the COG group when compared with the CG group, respectively (P < 0.05). The serum levels of cystatin-C (Cys-C), myeloperoxidase (MPO), and malondialdehyde (MDA) were reduced by 14.0%±3.8%, 26.9%±12.3%, and 19.7%±7.9% while nitric oxide (NO) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were increased by 12.5%±2.9% and 25.3%±13.4% in the COG group when compared with the CG group, respectively (P < 0.05). Cordycepin reduced the levels of TLR4, NF-κB, COX2, TNF-α, and IL-1β in HEK293T cells too (P < 0.05). However, cordycepin could not affect the levels anymore if TLR4 was silenced. Cordyceps militaris protected against CKD progression by affecting the TLR4/NF-κB lipid and redox signaling pathway via cordycepin.",New Insights into the Hepcidin-Ferroportin Axis and Iron Homeostasis in iPSC-Derived Cardiomyocytes from Friedreich's Ataxia Patient.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31049138,Oxidative medicine and cellular longevity,2019 05 05,"Iron homeostasis in the cardiac tissue as well as the involvement of the hepcidin-ferroportin (HAMP-FPN) axis in this process and in cardiac functionality are not fully understood. Imbalance of iron homeostasis occurs in several cardiac diseases, including iron-overload cardiomyopathies such as Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA, OMIM no. 229300), a hereditary neurodegenerative disorder. Exploiting the induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) technology and the iPSC capacity to differentiate into specific cell types, we derived cardiomyocytes of a FRDA patient and of a healthy control subject in order to study the cardiac iron homeostasis and the HAMP-FPN axis. Both CTR and FRDA iPSCs-derived cardiomyocytes express cardiac differentiation markers; in addition, FRDA cardiomyocytes maintain the FRDA-like phenotype. We found that FRDA cardiomyocytes show an increase in the protein expression of HAMP and FPN. Moreover, immunofluorescence analysis revealed for the first time an unexpected nuclear localization of FPN in both CTR and FRDA cardiomyocytes. However, the amount of the nuclear FPN was less in FRDA cardiomyocytes than in controls. These and other data suggest that iron handling and the HAMP-FPN axis regulation in FRDA cardiac cells are hampered and that FPN may have new, still not fully understood, functions. These findings underline the complexity of the cardiac iron homeostasis.",Protective Effects of Kaempferol on D-Ribose-Induced Mesangial Cell Injury.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31049137,Oxidative medicine and cellular longevity,2019 05 05,"Recently, it has been found that the level of urinary D-ribose in type 2 diabetes is notably higher than that in age-matched normal control, and D-ribose is more reactive in the glycation than D-glucose and induces oxidative stress. Kaempferol is one of the main bioactive components in Astragalus membranaceus, with numerous physiological actives, such as antioxidant. The present study investigated the protective effects of kaempferol on D-ribose-treated mesangial cells. CCK-8 and LDH assay were used to test cell viability and cell toxicity. Immunofluorescence and flow cytometry were used to detect the AGE formation and ROS accumulation. GSH level was measured to reflect oxidation resistance. Cell apoptosis was evaluated by Hoechst 33258 staining, AO/EB staining, and western blot. Mitochondrial membrane integrity was detected by JC-1 staining, western blot, and RT-PCR. The change of autophagy level was tested by western blot. The results indicated that D-ribose induced not only cell damage and increased AGE formation and ROS accumulation but also GSH depletion. Further studies demonstrated that D-ribose induced mitochondrial depolarization and the activation of caspase-9/3. But kaempferol could partly block these damages. Subsequently, it was confirmed that kaempferol repaired the autophagy disturbance induced by D-ribose, and 3-MA could reverse the protective effect of kaempferol under D-ribose condition. Our study demonstrated that D-ribose induced AGE accumulation and ROS production in mesangial cell and caused mitochondrial apoptosis, but kaempferol could attenuate these changes and its protective effect might be related to the repair of autophagy.",Potential Benefits of Nitrate Supplementation on Antioxidant Defense System and Blood Pressure Responses after Exercise Performance.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31049136,Oxidative medicine and cellular longevity,2019 05 05,"Nitrate (NO3-) supplementation is associated with exercise performance, oxygen uptake, blood flow, and blood pressure improvement, and it can act as an antioxidant agent. This study evaluated the effects of sodium nitrate supplementation on oxidative stress markers and blood pressure responses after aerobic exercise performance in physically active males. Fourteen subjects aged 22 ± 3 years and with a BMI of 23 ± 1 kg/m2 were submitted to four exercise tests in intervals of 5 days. Nitrate supplementation (NO session) and placebo supplementation (PL session) were acute (AC) and over a period of 5 days (FD) in random order with a crossover design. Saliva was collected at basal (0'); 60 min after supplementation (60'); immediately after exercise (90'); and 15, 30, and 60 min after the test (105', 120', and 150'). The NO session had higher concentrations (P < 0.05) of salivary nitrite in both AC and FD treatments when compared with the PL session. There was a reduction in systolic blood pressure (SBP) only after FD in the NO session. Furthermore, uric acid and total antioxidant capacity (FRAP) salivary concentrations increased, while SOD activity and TBARS levels decreased after FD but not after AC in the NO session. The results suggest that nitrate supplemented over a period of 5 days reduced SBP and indirectly acted as an antioxidant in healthy nonsedentary young men."

Emerging evidence has shown that selenium (Se) can effectively alleviate heat stress in dairy cows; however, the cellular mechanism underlying this protection is not clear. The purpose of this study was to investigate and compare the protective effects of inorganic Se (sodium selenite, SS) and organic Se (selenite methionine, SM) in MAC-T (mammary alveolar cells-large T antigen, a bovine mammary epithelial cell (BMEC) line) cells during heat stress. MAC-T cells were treated in 4 ways unless otherwise described: (i) cells in the heat treatment (HT) group were cultured at 42.5°C for 1 h and then recovered in 37°C for another 12 h; (ii) the SM group was pretreated with organic Se for 2 h, cultured at 42.5°C for 1 h, and then recovered in 37°C for 12 h; (iii) the SS group was treated similarly to the SM group except that the cells were pretreated with inorganic Se instead of organic Se; and (iv) the control group was continuously cultured in 37°C and received no Se treatment. The results showed that heat shock at 42.5°C for 1 h triggered heat shock response, sabotaged the redox balance, and reduced cell viability in MAC-T cells; and pretreatment of cells with SM or SS effectively alleviated the negative effects of heat shock on the cells. However, the cells were much more sensitive to SS treatment but more tolerant to SM. In addition, two forms of Se appeared to affect the expression of different genes, including nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in the SM group and thioredoxin reductase 1 (TXNRD1) in the SS group in Nrf2-ARE (antioxidant response element) antioxidant pathway and inflammation response. In summary, results showed the mechanistic differences in the protective effects of organic and inorganic Se on heat stress in BMECs.","2-Allylphenol Reduces IL-1β and TNF-α, Promoting Antinociception through Adenosinergic, Anti-Inflammatory, and Antioxidant Mechanisms.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31049124,Oxidative medicine and cellular longevity,2019 05 05,"2-Allylphenol (2-AP) is a synthetic phenylpropanoid, structurally related to cardanol, thymol, and ortho-eugenol. Phenylpropanoids are described in the literature as being capable of promoting biological activity. Due to the similarity between 2-AP and other bioactive phenylpropanoids, the present research aims at evaluating the antioxidant, antinociceptive, and anti-inflammatory potential of 2-AP in silico, in vitro, and in vivo. At 30 min prior to the start of in vivo pharmacological testing, administration of 2-AP (25, 50, 75, and 100 mg/kg i.p.), morphine (6 mg/kg i.p.), dexamethasone (2 mg/kg s.c.), or vehicle alone was performed. In the acetic acid-induced abdominal writhing tests, pretreatment with 2-AP significantly reduced the number of abdominal writhes, as well as decreased licking times in the glutamate and formalin tests. Investigation of the mechanism of action using the formalin model led to the conclusion that the opioid system does not participate in its activity. However, the adenosinergic system is involved. In the peritonitis tests, 2-AP inhibited leukocyte migration and reduced releases of proinflammatory mediators TNF-α and IL-1β. In vitro antioxidant assays demonstrated that 2-AP presents significant ability to sequester superoxide radicals. In silico docking studies confirmed interaction between 2-AP and the adenosine A2a receptor through hydrogen bonds with the critical asparagine 253 residues present in the active site. Investigation of 2-AP demonstrated its nociception inhibition and ability to reduce reactive oxygen species. Its interaction with A2a receptors may well be related to proinflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-1β reduction activity, corroborating its antinociceptive effect.",Tuning the Structure of Pt Nanoparticles through Support Interactions: An in Situ Polarized X-ray Absorption Study Coupled with Atomistic Simulations.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31049123,"The journal of physical chemistry. C, Nanomaterials and interfaces",2019 05 05,"Interactions of nanoparticles (NPs) with their environment may have a pronounced effect on their structure and shape as well as on their functionality in applications such as catalysis. It is therefore crucial to disentangle the particle-adsorbate and particle-support interaction effects on the particle shape, its local structure, atomic dynamics, and its possible anisotropies. In order to gain insight into the support effect, we carried out an X-ray absorption fine-structure spectroscopy (XAFS) investigation of adsorbate- and ligand-free size-selected Pt NPs deposited on two different supports in ultrahigh vacuum. Polarization-dependent XAFS measurements, neural network-based analysis of X-ray absorption near-edge structure data, and reverse Monte Carlo (RMC) simulations of extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) were used to resolve the 3D shape of the NPs and details of their local structure. A synergetic combination of advanced in situ XAFS analysis with atomic force microscopy and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) imaging provides uniquely detailed information about the particle-support interactions and the NP/support buried interface, not accessible to any experimental technique, when considered alone. In particular, our combined approach reveals differences in the structure of Pt NPs deposited on TiO2(110) and SiO2/Si(111). Pt NPs on SiO2 assume a spherical-like 3D shape and weakly interact with the support. In contrast, the effective shape of analogously synthesized Pt NPs on TiO2(110) after annealing at 600 °C is found to be a truncated octahedron with (100) top and interfacial facets that are encapsulated by the TiO2 support. Modeling disorder effects in these NPs using an RMC approach reveals differences in bond-length distributions for NPs on different supports and allows us to analyze their anisotropy, which may be crucial for the interpretation of support-dependent atomic dynamics and can have an impact on the understanding of the catalytic properties of these NPs.",Assessment of Two Problems of Specific Reaction Parameter Density Functional Theory: Sticking and Diffraction of H2 on Pt(111).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31049122,"The journal of physical chemistry. C, Nanomaterials and interfaces",2019 05 05,"It is important that theory is able to accurately describe dissociative chemisorption reactions on metal surfaces, as such reactions are often rate-controlling in heterogeneously catalyzed processes. Chemically accurate theoretical descriptions have recently been obtained on the basis of the specific reaction parameter (SRP) approach to density functional (DF) theory (DFT), allowing reaction barriers to be obtained with chemical accuracy. However, being semiempirical, this approach suffers from two basic problems. The first is that sticking probabilities (to which SRP density functionals (DFs) are usually fitted) might show differences across experiments, of which the origins are not always clear. The second is that it has proven hard to use experiments on diffractive scattering of H2 from metals for validation purposes, as dynamics calculations using a SRP-DF may yield a rather poor description of the measured data, especially if the potential used contains a van der Waals well. We address the first problem by performing dynamics calculations on three sets of molecular beam experiments on D2 + Pt(111), using four sets of molecular beam parameters to obtain sticking probabilities, and the SRP-DF recently fitted to one set of experiments on D2 + Pt(111). It is possible to reproduce all three sets of experiments with chemical accuracy with the aid of two sets of molecular beam parameters. The theoretical simulations with the four different sets of beam parameters allow one to determine for which range of incidence conditions the experiments should agree well and for which conditions they should show specific differences. This allows one to arrive at conclusions about the quality of the experiments and about problems that might affect the experiments. Our calculations on diffraction of H2 scattering from Pt(111) show both quantitative and qualitative differences with previously measured diffraction probabilities, which were Debye-Waller (DW)-extrapolated to 0 K. We suggest that DW extrapolation, which is appropriate for direct scattering, might fail if the scattering is affected by the presence of a van der Waals well and that theory should attempt to model surface atom motion for reproducing diffraction experiments performed for surface temperatures of 500 K and higher.",Effect of Charge-Transfer State Energy on Charge Generation Efficiency via Singlet Fission in Pentacene-Fullerene Solar Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31049121,"The journal of physical chemistry. C, Nanomaterials and interfaces",2019 05 05,"Singlet fission in pentacene creates two triplet excitons per absorbed photon. In a solar cell, each triplet can generate an electron-hole pair, and hence, external quantum efficiencies exceeding 100% have been reported for pentacene-fullerene solar cells. The energetics of this process are intriguing because the minimum photon energy loss, defined as the energy difference between the (triplet) exciton state and the open-circuit voltage, is less than 0.5 eV and distinctively smaller than that in most organic donor-acceptor solar cells. To investigate the energetics of this process, we analyze the effect of the energy of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) for different fullerene derivatives. With the LUMO energy becoming less negative, the open-circuit voltage increases and charge generation decreases. For all but one of the fullerenes tested, the charge-transfer state energy is distinctively higher than the pentacene triplet energy, revealing that charge generation via singlet fission is actually endergonic. An elementary Marcus model for the rate of electron transfer provides a qualitative description of the experimental trends, in accordance with an endergonic charge transfer. Considering that charge generation from triplet states is endergonic, involvement of pentacene singlet states, either from direct photoexcitation or via triplet-triplet annihilation, cannot be excluded.",Smoking and periodontal microorganisms.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31049117,The Japanese dental science review,2019 05 05,"Resolution of dysbiosis following treatment for periodontal disease and tobacco dependence has been reported in longitudinal intervention studies. In the present report, we evaluated the biological findings regarding the effect of smoking on the periodontal microbiome. A standardized electronic search was conducted using MEDLINE; overall, 1099 papers were extracted. Studies that addressed the relationship between tobacco and periodontal pathogens were included. Finally, 42 papers were deemed appropriate for the present review. Functional changes in periodontal pathogens exposed to nicotine and cigarette smoke extract support the clinical findings regarding dysbiosis of the subgingival microbiome. Dysbiosis of the periodontal microbiome was presented in smokers regardless of their periodontal condition (healthy, gingivitis, or periodontitis) and remained significant only in smokers even after the resolution of experimentally-induced gingivitis and following reduction of clinical signs of periodontitis with non-surgical periodontal treatment and over 3 months post-therapy. Based on these findings, smoking cessation in periodontitis patients is beneficial for promoting a health-compatible subgingival microbial community. To maximize the benefits of these interventions in dental settings, further studies on periodontal microbiome are needed to elucidate the impact of tobacco intervention on preventing recurrence of periodontal destruction in the susceptible subjects.",R-spondin signaling as a pivotal regulator of tissue development and homeostasis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31049116,The Japanese dental science review,2019 05 05,"R-spondins (Rspos) are cysteine-rich secreted glycoproteins which control a variety of cellular functions and are essential for embryonic development and tissue homeostasis. R-spondins (Rspo1 to 4) have high structural similarity and share 60% sequence homology. It has been shown that their cysteine-rich furin-like (FU) domain and the thrombospondin (TSP) type I repeat domain are essential for initiating downstream signaling cascades and therefore for their biological functions. Although numerous studies have unveiled their pivotal role as critical developmental regulators, the most important finding is that Rspos synergize Wnt signaling. Recent studies have identified novel receptors for Rspos, the Lgr receptors, closely related orphans of the leucin-rich repeat containing G protein-coupled receptors, and proposed that Rspos potentiate canonical Wnt signaling via these receptors. Given that Wnt signaling is one of the most important developmental signaling pathways that controls cell fate decisions and tissue development, growth and homeostasis, Rspos may function as key players for these processes as well as potential therapeutic targets. Here, I recapitulate the Wnt signaling and then outline the biological role of Rspos in tissue development and homeostasis and explore the possibility that Rspos may be used as therapeutic targets.",Hypertension after Kidney Transplantation: Clinical Significance and Therapeutical Aspects.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31049114,Open access Macedonian journal of medical sciences,2019 05 05,"Most of the kidney transplanted patients develop arterial hypertension after renal transplantation.

In this work, we have developed a simple HPLC method for direct analysis and quantification of the apo- and lipoylated forms (Hapo and Hlip) of the shuttle protein H, the latter (Hlip) is essential for the function of H protein and determines the activity of GCS. Effects of temperature, concentrations of lipoic acid and Hapo and the expression of H protein on its lipoylation were studied.

Furthermore, Hapo seems to inhibit the overall activity of GCS. We proposed a strategy of co-expressing LplA to improve the lipoylation of H protein and GCS activity.

Since AEC amplifications are accompanied by the loss of their native epithelial phenotype and by the progressive reduction of relevant biological properties, the issue to be addressed is the development of effective culture protocols. In this context, recently, it has been demonstrated that progesterone (P4) supplementation during ovine AEC (oAEC) expansion could prevent the undesirable epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). In contrast, there is no information to date on the role of the other pregnancy steroids in culture. With this aim, the present study has been designed to clarify the impact of estradiol (E2), alone or in combination with P4 (12.5 μM and 25 μM), during oAEC amplification. Steroid supplementations were assessed by testing oAEC proliferation, stemness, EMT, and osteogenic or chondrogenic plasticity. The results indicated that EMT can be prevented exclusively in the presence of high doses of P4, while it occurred rapidly in cells exposed to E2 as denoted by protein (cytokeratin-8 and alpha-SMA) and gene expression (vimentin and snail) profiles. Moreover, steroid exposure was able to influence highly oAEC plasticity. Particularly, P4-treated cells displayed a precommitment towards osteogenic lineage, confirmed by the upregulation of OCN, RUNX2, and the greater deposition of calcium nodules. Conversely, P4 exposure inhibited oAEC chondrogenic differentiation, which was induced in E2-treated cells as confirmed by the upregulation of chondrogenesis-related genes (SOX9, ACAN, and COL2A1) and by the accumulation of Alcian blue-positive extracellular matrix. Simultaneously, E2-treated cells remained unresponsive to osteogenic inductive stimuli. In conclusion, media supplementation with high doses of steroids may be adopted to modulate phenotype and plasticity during oAEC amplification.

Recently, TMS has been proposed to synchronise neural oscillators and to thereby increase the detectability of corresponding oscillations at the population level. As oscillations in the human brain are known to interact within nested hierarchies via phase-amplitude coupling, TMS might also be able to increase the macroscopic detectability of such coupling. In a concurrent TMS-electroencephalography study, we therefore examined the technique's influence on theta-gamma, alpha-gamma, and beta-gamma phase-amplitude coupling by delivering single-pulse TMS (sTMS) and repetitive TMS (rTMS) over the left motor cortex and right visual cortex of healthy participants. The rTMS pulse trains were of 5 Hz, 11 Hz, and 23 Hz for the three coupling variations, respectively. Relative to sham stimulation, all conditions showed transient but significant increases in phase-amplitude coupling at the stimulation site. In addition, we observed enhanced coupling over various other cortical sites, with a more extensive propagation during rTMS than during sTMS. By indicating that scalp-recorded phase-amplitude coupling can be effectively probed with TMS, these findings open the door to the technique's application in manipulative dissections of such coupling during human cognition and behaviour in healthy and pathological conditions.",Investigating the Efficacy of an Individualized Alpha/Delta Neurofeedback Protocol in the Treatment of Chronic Tinnitus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31049052,Neural plasticity,2019 05 26,"First attempts have demonstrated that the application of alpha/delta neurofeedback in the treatment of chronic tinnitus leads to a reduction of symptoms at the group level. However, recent research also suggests that chronic tinnitus is a decidedly heterogeneous phenomenon, one that requires treatment of distinct subgroups or even on an individual level. Thus, the purpose of this study was to evaluate an individually adjusted alpha/delta neurofeedback protocol. Following previous studies, the delta band fixed between 3 and 4 Hz was chosen as the frequency for inhibition. However, unlike the previous studies, the frequency range for the rewarded alpha band was not fixed between 8 and 12 Hz but rather individually determined according to each patient's specific alpha peak frequency (IAF). Twenty-six chronic tinnitus patients participated in 15 weekly neurofeedback training sessions and extensive pre- and post-tests, as well as follow-up testing 3 and 6 months after training. The main outcome measures were tinnitus-related distress measured with the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI) and Tinnitus Questionnaire (TQ), tinnitus loudness, and pre- and post-training resting-state EEG activity in trained frequency bands. In Results, the neurofeedback protocol led to a significant reduction of tinnitus-related distress and tinnitus loudness. While distress remained on a low level even 6 months after the completion of training, loudness returned to baseline levels in the follow-up period. In addition, resting-state EEG activity showed an increase in the trained alpha/delta ratio over the course of the training. This ratio increase was related to training-induced changes of tinnitus-related distress as measured with TQ, mainly due to increases in the alpha frequency range. In sum, this study confirms the alpha/delta neurofeedback as a suitable option for the treatment of chronic tinnitus and represents a first step towards the development of individual neurofeedback protocols. This clinical trial was registered online at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02383147) and kofam.ch (SNCTP000001313).",An Improved Refined Composite Multivariate Multiscale Fuzzy Entropy Method for MI-EEG Feature Extraction.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31049051,Computational intelligence and neuroscience,2019 05 05,"Feature extraction of motor imagery electroencephalogram (MI-EEG) has shown good application prospects in the field of medical health. Also, multivariate entropy-based feature extraction methods have been gradually applied to analyze complex multichannel biomedical signals, such as EEG and electromyography. Compared with traditional multivariate entropies, refined composite multivariate multiscale fuzzy entropy (RCmvMFE) overcomes the defect of unstable entropy values caused by the scale factor increase and is beneficial towards obtaining richer feature information. However, the coarse-grained process of RCmvMFE is mean filtered, which weakens Gaussian noise and is powerless against random impulse noise interference. This yields poor quality feature information and low accuracy classification. In this paper, RCmvMFE is improved (IRCmvMFE) by using composite filters in the coarse-grained procedure to enhance filter performance. Median filters are employed to remove the impulse noise interference from multichannel MI-EEG signals, and these filtered MI-EEGs are further smoothed by the mean filters. The multiscale IRCmvMFEs are calculated for all channels of composite filtered MI-EEGs, forming a feature vector, and a support vector machine is used for pattern classification. Based on two public datasets with different motor imagery tasks, the recognition results of 10 × 10-fold cross-validation achieved 99.43% and 99.86%, respectively, and the statistical analysis of experimental results was completed, showing the effectiveness of IRCmvMFE, as well. The proposed IRCmvMFE-based feature extraction method is superior compared to entropy-based and traditional methods.",Neonatal Alloimmune Neutropenia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31049048,Transfusion medicine and hemotherapy : offizielles Organ der Deutschen Gesellschaft fur Transfusionsmedizin und Immunhamatologie,2019 05 05,"Neonatal alloimmune neutropenia (NAIN, NAIN or NIN) is a neutrophil blood group antagonism, analogous to hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn (HDFN) and fetal/neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia (FNAIT). A limited number of prospective screening studies showed that granulocyte-specific antibodies were detectable in 0.35-1.1% of random postnatal maternal samples and that the incidence of NAIN was below 0.1%. Symptoms vary from none to mild skin infections, omphalitis or more severe infections like pneumonia, sepsis, and meningitis. Treatment of neonatal infection with antibiotics and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor is advised.",Comprehensive proteome and phosphoproteome profiling shows negligible influence of RNAlater on protein abundance and phosphorylation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31049047,Clinical proteomics,2019 05 05,"Certain tumors such as pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) are known to contain a variety of hydrolytic enzymes including RNases and proteases that may lead to degradation of RNA and proteins during sample processing. For such tumor tissues with RNA instability, RNAlater containing a high concentration of quaternary ammonium sulfates that denature RNA-hydrolyzing enzymes is often used to protect RNAs from hydrolysis. Although a few studies have been carried out to determine the effect of RNAlater on DNA and RNA, whether RNAlater influences the proteome and phosphoproteome is largely unknown. In this study we carried out a systematic and comprehensive analysis of the effect of RNAlater on the proteome and phosphoproteome using high-resolution mass spectrometry. PDAC tissues from three patients were individually pulverized and the tissue powders of each patient were divided into two portions, one of which was incubated in RNAlater at 4 °C for 24 h (RNAlater tissue) while the other was kept at - 80 °C (frozen tissue). Comprehensive quantitative profiling experiments on the RNAlater tissues and the frozen tissues resulted in the identification of 99,136 distinct peptides of 8803 protein groups and 17,345 phosphopeptides of 16,436 phosphosites. The data exhibited no significant quantitative changes in both proteins and phosphorylation between the RNAlater tissues and the frozen tissue. In addition, the phosphoproteome data showed heterogeneously activated pathways among the three patients that were not altered by RNAlater. These results indicate that the tissue preservation method using RNAlater can be effectively used on PDAC tissues for proteogenomic studies where preservation of intact DNA, RNA and proteins is prerequisite.

The atypical glucose metabolic phenomenon, known as the Warburg effect, has been recognized as a hallmark of cancer and serves as a promising target for tumor specific imaging. At present, 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-glucose (18F-FDG)-based positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) represented the state-of-the-art radionuclide imaging technique for this purpose. The powerful impact of 18F-FDG has prompted intensive research efforts into other glucose-based radiopharmaceuticals for positron emission tomography (PET) and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging. Currently, glucose and its analogues have been labeled with various radionuclides such as 99mTc, 111In, 18F, 68Ga, and 64Cu and have been successfully investigated for tumor metabolic imaging in many preclinical studies. Moreover, 99mTc-ECDG has advanced into its early clinical trials and brings a new era of tumor imaging beyond 18F-FDG. In this review, preclinical and early clinical development of glucose-based radiopharmaceuticals for tumor metabolic imaging will be summarized.",Iodine-Enhanced Micro-CT Imaging of Soft Tissue on the Example of Peripheral Nerve Regeneration.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31049044,Contrast media & molecular imaging,2019 05 05,"Microcomputed tomography (μCT) is widely used for the study of mineralized tissues, but a similar use for soft tissues is hindered by their low X-ray attenuation. This limitation can be overcome by the recent development of different staining techniques. Staining with Lugol's solution, a mixture of one part iodine and two parts potassium iodide in water, stands out among these techniques for its low complexity and cost. Currently, Lugol staining is mostly used for anatomical examination of tissues. In the present study, we seek to optimize the quality and reproducibility of the staining for ex vivo visualization of soft tissues in the context of a peripheral nerve regeneration model in the rat. We show that the staining result not only depends on the concentration of the staining solution but also on the amount of stain in relation to the tissue volume and composition, necessitating careful adaptation of the staining protocol to the respective specimen tissue. This optimization can be simplified by a stepwise staining which we show to yield a similar result compared to staining in a single step. Lugol staining solution results in concentration-dependent tissue shrinkage which can be minimized but not eliminated. We compared the shrinkage of tendon, nerve, skeletal muscle, heart, brain, and kidney with six iterations of Lugol staining. 60 ml of 0.3% Lugol's solution per cm3 of tissue for 24 h yielded good results on the example of a peripheral nerve regeneration model, and we were able to show that the regenerating nerve inside a silk fibroin tube can be visualized in 3D using this staining technique. This information helps in deciding the region of interest for histological imaging and provides a 3D context to histological findings. Correlating both imaging modalities has the potential to improve the understanding of the regenerative process.",Prognostic Value of 18F-Fluorocholine PET Parameters in Metastatic Castrate-Resistant Prostate Cancer Patients Treated with Docetaxel.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31049043,Contrast media & molecular imaging,2019 05 05,The availability of new treatments for metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) patients increases the need for reliable biomarkers to help clinicians to choose the better sequence strategy.

Pulmonary fibrosis is a chronic and progressive interstitial lung disease characterized by the dysregulated deposition of the extracellular matrix (ECM) with the destruction of normal tissue, resulting in end-stage organ failure. BLM-induced fibrosis is one of several different experimental models of pulmonary fibrosis, characterized by inflammation and excessive ECM deposition. We directly induced mouse lung injury by the intratracheal administration of bleomycin and monitored the physiological and biochemical changes in lung and skeletal muscle tissues by using lung function testing, ELISA, Western blotting, and immunohistochemistry. Here, we found that BLM-induced lung fibrosis with thickened interstitial lung tissue, including fibronectin and collagen, was correlated with the increased serum concentrations of IL-6 and IL-33 and accompanied by reduced lung function, including FRC (functional residual capacity), C chord (lung compliance), IC (inspiratory capacity), VC (vital capacity), TLC (total lung capacity), and FVC (forced vital capacity) (p < 0.05). The activity of AKT in lung tissue was suppressed, but conversely, the activity of STAT3 was enhanced during lung fibrosis in mice. In addition, we found that the amount of sST2, the soluble form of the IL-33 receptor, was dramatically decreased in lung fibrosis tissues. The skeletal muscle tissue isolated from lung injury mice increased the activation of STAT3 and AMPK, accompanied by an increased amount of Atrogin-1 protein in BLM-induced lung fibrosis mice. The mouse myoblast cell-based model showed that IL-6 and IL-33 specifically activated STAT3 and AMPK signaling, respectively, to induce the expression of the muscle-specific proteolysis markers MuRF1 and Atrogin-1. These data suggested that increased levels of IL-6 and IL-33 in the serum of mice with BLM-induced lung injury may cause lung fibrosis with thickened interstitial lung tissue accompanied by reduced lung function and muscle mass through the activation of STAT3 and AMPK signals.",The Acute Phase Proteins Reaction in Children Suffering from Pseudocroup.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31049027,Mediators of inflammation,2019 05 05,"The aim of the study was to evaluate the inflammatory reaction in children with pseudocroup and compare it with other laryngological diseases according to the available literature data. The study group included 51 children hospitalized because of pseudocroup. The measurements of the acute phase proteins (APP), such as C-reactive protein (CRP), alpha-1-antitrypsin (AT), alpha-1-antichymotrypsin (ACT), alpha-1-acid glycoprotein (AGP), ceruloplasmin (Cp), transferrin (Tf), alpha-2-macroglobulin (A2M), and haptoglobin (Hp) were obtained at 3 time points. The glycosylation profiles of AGP, ACT, and Tf were completed. An increased AGP level was observed in girls. The AGP glycosylation revealed the advantage of the W0 variant over the W1 variant. W1 and W2 were decreased in boys. W3 emerged in boys. The Tf concentration and T4 variant were lower compared to the control group. The A2M level was lower after treatment. The Hp and AT levels were decreased a few weeks later. The ACT glycosylation revealed a decrease of the A4 variant in boys. In conclusion, the inflammatory reaction during pseudocroup was of low intensity. The APP glycosylation suggested a chronic process. In a follow-up investigation, no normalization of the parameters was noted, but signs of persistent inflammation were observed.",Association between Neutrophil-Lymphocyte and Platelet-Lymphocyte Ratios and Coronary Artery Calcification Score among Asymptomatic Patients: Data from a Cross-Sectional Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31049026,Mediators of inflammation,2019 05 05,"Atherosclerosis is a low-grade inflammatory disease.

An increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) has been linked to several conditions, including inflammation and pain processing. Therefore, new or repurposed drugs with the ability of reducing ROS-triggered responses are promising candidates for analgesic drugs. Vinpocetine is a clinically used nootropic drug with antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and analgesic properties. However, the effects of vinpocetine have not been investigated in a model with a direct relationship between ROS, inflammation, and pain. Based on that, we aimed to investigate the effects of vinpocetine in a model of superoxide anion-induced pain and inflammation using potassium superoxide (KO2) as a superoxide anion donor to trigger inflammation and pain. In the KO2 model, vinpocetine dose-dependently reduced pain-like behaviors (spontaneous pain and hyperalgesia), paw edema, and neutrophil and mononuclear cell recruitment to the paw skin (assessed by H&E staining, fluorescence, and enzymatic assays) and to the peritoneal cavity. Vinpocetine also restored tissue endogenous antioxidant ability and Nrf2 and Ho-1 mRNA expression and reduced superoxide anion production and gp91phox mRNA expression. We also observed the inhibition of IκBα degradation by vinpocetine, which demonstrates a reduction in the activation of NF-κB explaining the diminished production of IL-33, IL-1β, and TNF-α. Collectively, our data show that vinpocetine alleviates pain and inflammation induced by KO2, which is a mouse model with a direct role of ROS in triggering pain and other inflammatory phenomena. Thus, the results suggest the repurposing of vinpocetine as an anti-inflammatory and analgesic drug.",Cytotoxic Function and Cytokine Production of Natural Killer Cells and Natural Killer T-Like Cells in Systemic Lupus Erythematosis Regulation with Interleukin-15.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31049024,Mediators of inflammation,2019 05 05,"Natural killer cells and NKT-like cells are the first line immune defense against tumor and virus infection. Deficient NK and NKT-like cell effector function may contribute to increased susceptibility to infection in SLE patients. We sought to examine the perforin and granzyme B expression, interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), and tumor-necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) production and CD107a degranulation of NK and NKT-like cells from SLE patients and their regulation by IL-15. We established that (1) perforin expression on SLE NK cells was decreased but unrelated to disease activity; (2) the MFI of granzyme B was increased in NK cells from SLE patients with active disease, associated with increased percentages of granzyme B+ CD56bright NK cells; (3) NK cells from active SLE patients, both CD56dim and CD56bright NK subsets, produced higher IFN-γ compared to controls; (4) CD56dim, but not CD56bright NK cells from active SLE patients, produced lower TNF-α, compared to inactive SLE patients and controls; (5) CD107a degranulation of SLE NK cells was comparable to controls; (6) IL-15 enhanced perforin/granzyme B expression, IFN-γ/TNF-α production, and CD107a degranulation of NK cells from SLE patients; and (7) similar observations were found for CD56+CD3+ NKT-like cells. Taken together, we demonstrated the differential expression of the heightened granzyme B and decreased TNF-α in NK and NKT-like cells in SLE patients. Higher granzyme B expression of NK and NKT-like cells in active SLE patients, further enhanced by circulating IL-15, may contribute to the maintenance of inflammation in SLE.",The Association between Depression and Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus: Inflammatory Cytokines as Ferrymen in between?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31049023,Mediators of inflammation,2019 05 05,"The depression incidence is much higher in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM), and the majority of these cases remain under-diagnosed. Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D) is now widely thought to be an organ-specific autoimmune disease. As a chronic autoimmune condition, T1D is characterized by T cell-mediated selective loss of insulin-producing β-cells. The age of onset of T1D is earlier than T2D, and T1D patients have an increased vulnerability to depression due to its diagnosis and treatment burden occurring in a period when the individuals are young. The literature has suggested that inflammatory cytokines play a wide role in both diseases. In this review, the mechanisms behind the initiation and propagation of the autoimmune response in T1D and depression are analyzed, and the contribution of cytokines to both conditions is discussed. This review outlines the immunological mechanism of T1D and depression, with a particular emphasis on the role of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), IL-1β, and interferon-γ (IFN-γ) cytokines and their signaling pathways. The purpose of this review is to highlight the possible pathways of the cytokines shared by these two diseases via deciphering their cytokine cascades. They may provide a basic groundwork for future study of the possible mechanism that links these two diseases and to develop new compounds that target the same pathway but can conquer two diseases.",Chronic Inflammation as a Link between Periodontitis and Carcinogenesis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31049022,Mediators of inflammation,2019 05 05,"Periodontitis is characterized by a chronic inflammation produced in response to a disease-associated multispecies bacterial community in the subgingival region. Although the inflammatory processes occur locally in the oral cavity, several studies have determined that inflammatory mediators produced during periodontitis, as well as subgingival species and bacterial components, can disseminate from the oral cavity, contributing therefore, to various extraoral diseases like cancer. Interestingly, carcinogenesis associated with periodontal species has been observed in both the oral cavity and in extra oral sites. In this review, several studies were summarized showing a strong association between orodigestive cancers and poor oral health, presence of periodontitis-associated bacteria, tooth loss, and clinical signs of periodontitis. Proinflammatory pathways were also summarized. Such pathways are activated either by mono- or polymicrobial infections, resulting in an increase in the expression of proinflammatory molecules such as IL-6, IL-8, IL-1β, and TNF-α. In addition, it has been shown that several periodontitis-associated species induce the expression of genes related to cell proliferation, cell cycle, apoptosis, transport, and immune and inflammatory responses. Intriguingly, many of these pathways are linked to carcinogenesis. Among them, the activation of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and antiapoptotic pathways (such as the PI3K/Akt, JAK/STAT, and MAPK pathways), the reduction of proapoptotic protein expression, the increase in cell migration and invasion, and the enhancement in metastasis are addressed. Considering that periodontitis is a polymicrobial disease, it is likely that mixed species promote carcinogenesis both in the oral cavity and in extra oral tissues and probably-as observed in periodontitis-synergistic and/or antagonistic interactions occur between microbes in the community. To date, a good amount of studies has allowed us to understand how monospecies infections activate pathways involved in tumorigenesis; however, more studies are needed to determine the combined effect of oral species in carcinogenesis.",Patient Perceptions of the Impact of Treatment (Surgery and Radiotherapy) for Soft Tissue Sarcoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31049021,Sarcoma,2019 05 05,"Treatment for soft tissue sarcoma (STS) is challenging for patients.

Originally identified as the gene involved in the pathogenesis of Ewing sarcoma, the EWSR1 gene is now known to be rearranged in diverse clinical and histopathological entities. The NFATC2 gene is one of the many translocation partners of EWSR1 in gene fusions in a morphologically typical, albeit rare, subgroup of mesenchymal tumors. Little is known about the clinical characteristics of tumors containing NFATC2 gene rearrangements since most of the few reports published describe molecular rather than clinical aspects. In the current study, we report three patients with tumors carrying the EWSR1-NFATC2 gene translocation, including one rare primary tumor of soft tissues. Another patient with a benign-appearing bone tumor with a unique FUS-NFATC2 gene translocation is described. In various mesenchymal tumors (e.g., myxoid/round cell liposarcoma, low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma, or angiomatoid fibrous histiocytoma), the FUS gene, as a member of the TET family, may be alternatively rearranged instead of the EWSR1 gene without any noticeable influence on the microscopical appearance or clinical outcome. This fact seems not to apply to mesenchymal tumors with the involvement of the NFATC2 gene because both in our experience and according to the extensive literature review, they have different properties on the morphological and molecular level. Both ESWSR1-NFATC2 and FUS-NFATC2 fusion-carrying tumors do not show microscopical or clinical features of Ewing sarcoma.","Queer Youth, Intoxication and Queer Drinking Spaces.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31049019,Journal of youth studies,2019 05 05,"Research on intoxicating substances and gender has developed considerably in the last 30 years, especially in the social sciences as feminist scholars highlighted the contradictory discourses about young women's intoxication. Nevertheless, there still remain significant gaps if we are to fully understand the role and meaning of intoxication for all young people and not merely for heterosexual, cisgender young people. As a way of exploring the possible limitations of this legacy, we will examine the qualitative data from 52 in-depth interviews with self-identified LGBTQ young people. Our analysis explores the relationships between meanings of intoxication and sexual and gender identities, drinking spaces, and the extent to which notions of masculinity and femininity influence alcohol consumption and drinking practices among LGBTQ youth. As gender expressions among young people, especially those who identify as LGBTQ, become increasingly nuanced and fluid, understanding the role of social and cultural practices of alcohol consumption in the performance of sexual and gender identities may increase our understanding of the ways in which sexuality and gender influence alcohol consumption."

Nowadays, in vitro and in vivo deliveries of nanoparticle (NPs) drugs have been paid more attention, intensively. Moreover, the current chemotherapeutic drugs have few first rate drawbacks including lack of specificity and requirement of excessive drug doses. To overcome this problem of chemotherapy, the attainment of high drug loading in combination with degradable polymer nanoparticles (for instance,chitosan) is a trending research in cancer biology. Hence, in this study, the synthesized PAC-AgNPs were successfully crosslinked with chitosan nanoparticles (CS-PAC-AgNPs), which were found to be spherical or polygonal in shape with a median size of 70.68 nm and 52.16 nm as observed by FTIR, FESEM and TEM analysis; thus, being suitable for drug delivery. CS-PAC-AgNPs were taken up via endocytosis by cancer cells and enabled the release cytochrome-C from mitochondria, followed by dysregulation of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl2 family, inducing the apoptotic mediated activation of caspase 9 and 3. To identify the genotoxicity of the synthesized CS-PAC-AgNPs, the mortality, hatching rate, malformation and abnormalities of embryo/larvae of the vertebrate zebra fish model (Danio rerio) were observed in a dose-time-dependent manner.

In total, we collected 849 individual fish, representing 44 species, from the intertidal lagoon flats at Palmyra and recovered 17 parasitic copepod species. The parasitic copepods were: Orbitacolaxwilliamsi on Mulloidichthysflavolineatus; Anuretesserratus on Acanthurusxanthopterus; Caligusconfusus on Carangoidesferdau, Carangoidesorthogrammus, Caranxignobilis, Caranxmelampygus, and Caranxpapuensis; Caliguskapuhili on Chaetodonauriga and Chaetodonlunula; Caliguslaticaudus on Rhinecanthusaculeatus, Pseudobalistesflavimarginatus, M.flavolineatus, Upeneustaeniopterus, Chrysipteraglauca, and Epinephalusmerra; Caligusmutabilis on Lutjanusfulvus and Lutjanusmonostigma; Caligusrandalli on C.ignobilis; Caligus sp. on L.fulvus; Caritusserratus on Chanoschanos; Lepeophtheiruslewisi on A.xanthopterus; Lepeophtheirusuluus on C.ignobilis; Dissonussimilis on Arothronhispidus; Nemesis sp. on Carcharhinusmelanopterus; Hatschekialongiabdominalis on A.hispidus; Hatschekiabicaudata on Chaetodonauriga and Chaetodonlunula; Kroyerialongicauda on C.melanopterus and Lernanthropus sp. on Kyphosuscinerascens.

Pathological fractures of the long bones are common, but guidelines on fracture treatment in these patients are still lacking. We have treated 5 fractures in 2 pediatric pycnodysostosis patients. We hypothesize that pycnodysostosis patients have an incomplete remodeling process in fracture healing because of cathepsin K deficiency. Therefore, to minimize the role of endochondral bone formation (indirect) after a fracture, it seems prudent to strive for direct bone healing (intramembranous) instead of indirect bone healing.

Changes in the MJO's amplitude, phase speed, and zonal scale are examined in five Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) models that demonstrate superior MJO characteristics. Under warming, the CMIP5 models exhibit a robust increase in the spectral power of planetary-scale, intraseasonal, eastward-propagating (MJO) precipitation anomalies (~10.9 %K-1). The amplification of MJO variability is accompanied by an increase of the spectral power of the corresponding westward traveling waves at a similar rate. This suggests that enhanced MJO variability in a warmer climate is likely caused by enhanced background tropical precipitation variability, not by changes in the MJO's stability. All models examined show an increase in the MJO's phase speed (1.8 - 4.5 %K-1) and a decrease in the MJO's zonal wavenumber (1.0 - 3.8 %K-1). Using a linear moisture mode framework, this study tests the theory-predicted phase speed changes against the simulated phase speed changes. It is found that the MJO's acceleration in a warmer climate is a result of enhanced horizontal moisture advection by the steepening of the mean meridional moisture gradient and the decrease in zonal wavenumber, which is partially offset by the lengthening of the convective moisture adjustment timescale and the increase in gross dry stability. While the ability of the linear moisture mode framework to explain MJO phase speed changes is model dependent, the theory can accurately predict the phase speed changes in the model ensemble."

Safety standards for industrial robots operating in specific spaces have been established, but no such standards have been specified for collaborative and service robots. To establish safety standards for such robots, we assessed pressure pain thresholds for collisions between humans and robots, under the assumption that the pain threshold is lower than the mild injury threshold. The pressure pain threshold for collision with a robot was measured in 90 male Korean adults using a homemade collision system. The pain thresholds were measured three times at 15 sites, including the forehead. The highest threshold was 196.1 ± 85.8 N/cm2 at the back of the hand, and the lowest was 65.1 ± 22.6 N/cm2 at an arm nerve. Moderate thresholds, i.e., 100-120 N/cm2, were noted on the forehead, neck muscle, ball of the thumb, and shin. The thresholds of participants < 30 years of age were lower, by 3-33%, than those of participants aged > 30 years. Thresholds differed by body mass index only at certain sites, including the shoulder joint, neck, and back of the hand. The pressure pain threshold depended on individual characteristics, body site, and age. The threshold relevant to potential human-robot collisions was determined to be between 65.1 ± 22.6 and 196.1 ± 85.8 N/cm2.","Diaphorin, a polyketide synthesized by an intracellular symbiont of the Asian citrus psyllid, is potentially harmful for biological control agents.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31048920,PloS one,2019 05 19,"The Asian citrus psyllid Diaphorina citri Kuwayama (Hemiptera: Sternorrhyncha: Psylloidea: Liviidae) is an important pest of citrus species worldwide because it transmits Candidatus Liberibacter spp. (Alphaproteobacteria), the causative agents of an incurable citrus disease known as huanglongbing or greening disease. Diaphorina citri possesses a vertically-transmitted intracellular symbiont, Candidatus Profftella armatura (Betaproteobacteria), which produces diaphorin, a polyketide that is significantly toxic to mammalian cells. Diaphorin is an analog of pederin, a defensive polyketide in the body fluid of Paederus rove beetles (Coleoptera: Staphylinidae) that deters predators. In the present study, as a first step to assess the possibility that diaphorin is toxic to biological control agents, we assayed diaphorin activities against insects and fungi. The target cells and organisms were (a) the Sf9 cell line derived from the fall armyworm moth Spodoptera frugiperda (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), (b) the pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum (Hemiptera: Sternorrhyncha: Aphidoidea: Aphididae), a phloem sap-sucking insect that is closely related to psyllids, (c) the Asian lady beetle Harmonia axyridis (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae), one of the major predators of D. citri, and (d) the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Ascomycota: Saccharomycetes) as a model of fungal pathogens. For a comparison, we also evaluated pederin activities. The results of our analyses revealed the following: (1) Diaphorin and pederin are significantly toxic to the tested insects and yeast; (2) Their toxicities vary widely among the target cells and organisms; (3) Diaphorin is generally less toxic than pederin; (4) The toxicities of diaphorin and pederin are considerably different in the Sf9 insect cell line and S. cerevisiae, but similar in A. pisum and H. axyridis; and (5) The amount of diaphorin contained in D. citri is toxic to all of the tested cells and organisms, suggesting that this polyketide is potentially harmful for biological control agents.",Engagement present and future: Graduate student and faculty perceptions of social media and the role of the public in science engagement.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31048919,PloS one,2019 05 19,"Interest in public engagement with science activities has grown in recent decades, especially engagement through social media and among graduate students.

As a major branch of PFPs, bacteria pore-forming toxins (PFTs) permeabilize membranes and usually cause the death of target cells. E. coli hemolysin ClyA is the first member with the pore complex structure solved among α-PFTs, employing α-helices as transmembrane elements. ClyA is proposed to form pores composed of various numbers of protomers. With high-resolution cryo-EM structures, we observe that ClyA pore complexes can exist as newly confirmed oligomers of a tridecamer and a tetradecamer, at estimated resolutions of 3.2 Å and 4.3 Å, respectively. The 2.8 Å cryo-EM structure of a dodecamer dramatically improves the existing structural model. Structural analysis indicates that protomers from distinct oligomers resemble each other and neighboring protomers adopt a conserved interaction mode. We also show a stabilized intermediate state of ClyA during the transition process from soluble monomers to pore complexes. Unexpectedly, even without the formation of mature pore complexes, ClyA can permeabilize membranes and allow leakage of particles less than ~400 Daltons. In addition, we are the first to show that ClyA forms pore complexes in the presence of cholesterol within artificial liposomes. These findings provide new mechanistic insights into the dynamic process of pore assembly for the prototypical α-PFT ClyA.",Quality assessment of clinical practice guidelines using the AGREE instrument in Japan: A time trend analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31048914,PloS one,2019 05 19,"Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) are representative methods for promoting the standardization of healthcare and improvement of its quality.

Although relying on indigenous yeast can be a risk for winemaking, local yeast diversity is associated with complexity and stronger identity of the wine produced, compared to inoculated alcoholic fermentation with commercial yeast strains. In this context, the main yeast species present on grapes, leaves and soils of Tempranillo and Cabernet Sauvignon vineyards in the hot semi-arid climate of the Texas High Plains area were investigated, as well as the presence and dynamics of yeast species during spontaneous fermentations of Tempranillo grapes from the same vineyards. Molecular characterization of yeast species was performed using culture-dependent 5.8S-ITS restriction fragment length polymorphism method and sequencing. Yeast species recovered from grapes, leaves, and soils were mainly dominated by Aureobasidium pullulans, Cryptococcus species, Filobasidium species and Naganishia species, typical members of the vineyard environment. One isolate of potential enological interest, Lachancea thermotolerans, a fermenting yeast with potential in must acidification, was recovered from the vineyard environment. However, spontaneous alcoholic fermentations revealed the presence of fermenting yeast species, including Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Lachancea thermotolerans and Hanseniaspora species. The presence of the three aforementioned species is of extreme interest for winemaking in the Texas High Plains area. Indeed, Saccharomyces cerevisiae is the model for alcoholic fermentation, Hanseniaspora species have been shown to improve palatability of wines, and Lachancea thermotolerans has become of increasing interest due to its potential to acidify musts and palatability. One of the main characteristics of grapes grown in the Texas High Plains area being the lack of acidity, focusing on these three yeast species could promote the development of locally oriented started cultures for the production of wines with a stronger local identity.","Methods, outcomes, and costs of a 2.5 year comprehensive facility-and community-based HIV testing intervention in Bukoba Municipal Council, Tanzania, 2014-2017.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31048912,PloS one,2019 05 19,"To diagnose ≥90% HIV-infected residents (diagnostic coverage), the Bukoba Combination Prevention Evaluation (BCPE) implemented provider-initiated (PITC), home- (HBHTC), and venue-based (VBHTC) HIV testing and counseling (HTC) intervention in Bukoba Municipal Council, a mixed urban and rural lake zone community of 150,000 residents in Tanzania. This paper describes the methods, outcomes, and incremental costs of these HTC interventions. PITC was implemented in outpatient department clinics in all eight public and three faith-based health facilities. In clinics, lay counselors routinely screened and referred eligible patients for HIV testing conducted by HTC-dedicated healthcare workers. In all 14 wards, community teams offered HTC to eligible persons encountered at 31,293 home visits and at 79 male- and youth-frequented venues. HTC was recommended for persons who were not in HIV care or had not tested in the prior 90 days.

Compared with other strategies, PITC conducted proportionally more tests among females (65%), and VBHTC conducted proportionally more tests among males (69%) and young-adults aged 15-24 years (42%). Of 5,550 (4.2% of all tests) HIV-positive tests, 4,143 (75%) clients were newly HIV diagnosed, including 1,583 males and 881 young adults aged 15-24 years. Of HIV tests conducted 3.7%, 1.8%, and 2.1% of PITC, HBHTC, and VBHTC clients, respectively, were newly HIV diagnosed; PITC accounted for 79% of all new diagnoses. Cost per test (per new diagnosis) was $4.55 ($123.66), $6.45 ($354.44), and $7.98 ($372.67) for PITC, HBHTC, and VBHTC, respectively. In a task-shifting analysis in which lay counselors replaced healthcare workers, estimated costs per test (per new diagnosis) would have been $3.06 ($83.15), $ 4.81 ($264.04), and $5.45 ($254.52), for PITC, HBHTC, and VBHTC, respectively.

This paper investigates the wing performance of Caudipteryx, the most basal non-volant dinosaur with pennaceous feathered forelimbs by using modal effective mass theory. From a mechanical standpoint, the forced vibrations excited by hindlimb locomotion stimulate the movement of wings, creating a flapping-like motion in response. This shows that the origin of the avian flight stroke should lie in a completely natural process of active locomotion on the ground. In this regard, flapping in the history of evolution of avian flight should have already occurred when the dinosaurs were equipped with pennaceous remiges and rectrices. The forced vibrations provided the initial training for flapping the feathered wings of theropods similar to Caudipteryx."

The condition constitutes the extreme of hyperopia or farsightedness, a common refractive error that is associated with strabismus and amblyopia in children. NNO1 was the first mapped nanophthalmos locus. We used combined pooled exome sequencing and strong linkage data in the large family used to map this locus to identify a canonical splice site alteration upstream of the last exon of the gene encoding myelin regulatory factor (MYRF c.3376-1G>A), a membrane bound transcription factor that undergoes autoproteolytic cleavage for nuclear localization. This variant produced a stable RNA transcript, leading to a frameshift mutation p.Gly1126Valfs*31 in the C-terminus of the protein. In addition, we identified an early truncating MYRF frameshift mutation, c.769dupC (p.S264QfsX74), in a patient with extreme axial hyperopia and syndromic features. Myrf conditional knockout mice (CKO) developed depigmentation of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and retinal degeneration supporting a role of this gene in retinal and RPE development. Furthermore, we demonstrated the reduced expression of Tmem98, another known nanophthalmos gene, in Myrf CKO mice, and the physical interaction of MYRF with TMEM98.

These rigid fibrils serve as skeletal support for the fin fold and as substrates for mesenchymal cell migration. In the adult intact fins, actinotrichia are restricted to the distal domain of the fin. Following fin amputation, actinotrichia also reform during regeneration. The actinodin gene family codes for structural proteins of actinotrichia. We have previously identified cis-acting regulatory elements in a 2kb genomic region upstream of the first exon of actinodin1, termed 2P, required for tissue-specific expression in the fin fold ectoderm and mesenchyme during embryonic development. Indeed, 2P contains an ectodermal enhancer in a 150bp region named epi. Deletion of epi from 2P results in loss of ectodermal-specific activity. In the present study, we sought to further characterize the activity of these regulatory sequences throughout fin development and during adult fin regeneration. Using a reporter transgenic approach, we show that a site within the epi region, termed epi3, contains an early mesenchymal-specific repressor. We also show that the larval fin fold ectodermal enhancer within epi3 remains functional in the basal epithelial layer during fin regeneration. We show that the first non-coding exon and first intron of actinodin1 contains a transcriptional enhancer and an alternative promoter that are necessary for the persistence of reporter expression reminiscent of actinodin1 expression during adulthood. Altogether, we have identified cis-acting regulatory elements that are required for tissue-specific expression as well as full recapitulation of actinodin1 expression during adulthood. Furthermore, the characterization of these elements provides us with useful molecular tools for the enhancement of transgene expression in adulthood.",Does trumpet playing affect lung function?-A case-control study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31048898,PloS one,2019 06 10,"The effect a wind instrument has on lung function is a much-discussed topic with inconclusive data, not least because existing studies combine all wind instruments as one entity.

Transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily vanilloid member 4 (TRPV4) plays an intricate role in homeostatic processes that needs to be deciphered in normal and diabetic retina. Based on previous findings showing that TRPV4 antagonists resolve blood-retina barrier (BRB) breakdown in diabetic rats, we evaluated whether TRPV4 channel inhibition prevents and reverts retinal edema in streptozotocin(STZ)-induced diabetic mice. We assessed retinal edema using common metrics, including retinal morphology/thickness (histology) and BRB integrity (albumin-associated tracer), and also by quantifying water mobility through apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) measures. ADC was measured by diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI), acquired ex vivo at 4 weeks after STZ injection in diabetes and control groups. DWI images were also used to assess retinal thickness. TRPV4 was genetically ablated or pharmacologically inhibited as follows: left eyes were used as vehicle control and right eyes were intravitreally injected with TRPV4-selective antagonist GSK2193874, 24 h before the end of the 4 weeks of diabetes. Histological data show that retinal thickness was similar in nondiabetic and diabetic wt groups but increased in diabetic Trpv4-/- mice. In contrast, DWI shows retinal thinning in diabetic wt mice that was absent in diabetic Trpv4-/- mice. Disorganized outer nuclear layer was observed in diabetic wt but not in diabetic Trpv4-/- retinas. We further demonstrate increased water diffusion, increased distances between photoreceptor nuclei, reduced nuclear area in all nuclear layers, and BRB hyperpermeability, in diabetic wt mice, effects that were absent in diabetic Trpv4-/- mice. Retinas of diabetic mice treated with PBS showed increased water diffusion that was not normalized by GSK2193874. ADC maps in nondiabetic Trpv4-/- mouse retinas showed restricted diffusion. Our data provide evidence that water diffusion is increased in diabetic mouse retinas and that TRPV4 function contributes to retinal hydro-mineral homeostasis and structure under control conditions, and to the development of BRB breakdown and increased water diffusion in the retina under diabetes conditions. A single intravitreous injection of TRPV4 antagonist is however not sufficient to revert these alterations in diabetic mouse retinas.","Spatiotemporal patterns and ecological factors of tuberculosis notification: A spatial panel data analysis in Guangxi, China.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31048894,PloS one,2019 05 19,"Guangxi is one of the provinces having the highest notification rate of tuberculosis in China.

While previous research examines the association between meteorological conditions and AGI, little is known about how socio-cultural factors may modify this relationship. This present study seeks to address this research gap by comparing AGI prevalence and determinants between an Indigenous and non-Indigenous population in Uganda. We estimate the 14-day self-reported prevalence of AGI among adults in an Indigenous Batwa population and their non-Indigenous neighbours using cross-sectional panel data collected over four periods spanning typically rainy and dry seasons (January 2013 to April 2014). The independent associations between Indigenous status, precipitation, and AGI are examined with multivariable multi-level logistic regression models, controlling for relative wealth status and clustering at the community level. Estimated prevalence of AGI among the Indigenous Batwa was greater than among the non-Indigenous Bakiga. Our models indicate that both Indigenous identity and decreased levels of precipitation in the weeks preceding the survey period were significantly associated with increased AGI, after adjusting for confounders. Multivariable models stratified by Indigenous identity suggest that Indigenous identity may not modify the association between precipitation and AGI in this context. Our results suggest that short-term changes in precipitation affect both Indigenous and non-Indigenous populations similarly, though from different baseline AGI prevalences, maintaining rather than exacerbating this socially patterned health disparity. In the context of climate change, these results may challenge the assumption that changing weather patterns will necessarily exacerbate existing socially patterned health disparities.",Global trends in lifespan inequality: 1950-2015.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31048892,PloS one,2019 05 19,"Using data from the UN World Population Prospects, we document global trends in lifespan inequality from 1950 until 2015.

Such changes have occurred against a backdrop of generalized longevity increases. Our analyses suggest that the world is facing a new challenge: the emergence of diverging trends in longevity and age-at-death inequality among the elderly around the globe-particularly in high-income areas.

Previously, we showed that by controlling for the confounding effects of somatic instability to estimate the progenitor allele CTG length in blood DNA, age at onset correlations could be significantly improved. To determine the suitability of saliva DNA as a source for genotyping, we used small pool-PCR to perform a detailed quantitative study of the somatic mutational dynamics of the CTG repeat in saliva and blood DNA from 40 DM1 patients. Notably, the modal allele length in saliva was only moderately higher in saliva and not as large as previously observed in most other tissues. The lower boundary of the allele distribution was also slightly higher in saliva than it was in blood DNA. However, the progenitor allele length estimated in blood explained more of the variation in age at onset than that estimated from saliva. Interestingly, although the modal allele length was slightly higher in saliva, the overall degree of somatic variation was typically lower than in blood DNA, revealing new insights into the tissue-specific dynamics of somatic mosaicism. These data indicate that saliva constitutes an accessible, non-invasive and suitable DNA sample source for performing genetic studies in DM1."

However, how the bacteria maintain chronic colonization in the face of constant mucus and epithelial cell turnover in the stomach is unclear. Here, we present a new model of how H. pylori establish and persist in stomach, which involves the colonization of a specialized microenvironment, or microniche, deep in the gastric glands. Using quantitative three-dimensional (3D) confocal microscopy and passive CLARITY technique (PACT), which renders tissues optically transparent, we analyzed intact stomachs from mice infected with a mixture of isogenic, fluorescent H. pylori strains with unprecedented spatial resolution. We discovered that a small number of bacterial founders initially establish colonies deep in the gastric glands and then expand to colonize adjacent glands, forming clonal population islands that persist over time. Gland-associated populations do not intermix with free-swimming bacteria in the surface mucus, and they compete for space and prevent newcomers from establishing in the stomach. Furthermore, bacterial mutants deficient in gland colonization are outcompeted by wild-type (WT) bacteria. Finally, we found that host factors such as the age at infection and T-cell responses control bacterial density within the glands. Collectively, our results demonstrate that microniches in the gastric glands house a persistent H. pylori reservoir, which we propose replenishes the more transient bacterial populations in the superficial mucosa.",An integrated understanding of the complex drivers of emergency presentations and admissions in cancer patients: Qualitative modelling of secondary-care health professionals' experiences and views.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31048875,PloS one,2019 06 10,"The number of cancer-related emergency presentations and admissions has been steadily increasing in the UK. Drivers of this phenomenon are complex, multifactorial and interlinked. The main objective of this study was to understand the complexity of emergency hospital use in cancer patients. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 42 senior clinicians (20 doctors, 22 nurses) with diverse expertise and experience in caring for acutely ill cancer patients in the secondary care setting. Data analysis included thematic analysis and purposive text analysis to develop Causal Loop Diagrams. Our Causal Loop Diagrams represent an integrated understanding of the complex factors (13) influencing emergency hospital use in cancer patients. Eight factors formed five reinforcing feedback loops and therefore were high-leverage influences: Ability of patients and carers to self-care and cope; Effective and timely management of ambulatory care sensitive conditions by primary and community care; Sufficient and effective social care for patients and carers; Avoidable emergency hospital use; Bed capacity; Patients accessing timely appropriate specialist inpatient or ambulatory care; Prompt and effective management and prevention of acute episode; Timely and safe discharge with appropriate support. The loops show that reduction of avoidable hospital use helps relieve hospital bed pressure; improved bed capacity then has a decisive, positive influence on patient pathway and thus outcome and experience in the hospital; in turn, better in-hospital care and discharge help patients and carers self-care and cope better back home with better support from community-based health and social care services, which then reduces their future emergency hospital use. To optimise acute and emergency cancer care, it is also essential that patients, carers and other clinicians caring for cancer patients have prompt access to senior cancer specialists for advice, assessment, clinical decision and other support. The findings provide a useful framework and focus for service planners aiming to optimise care.",Simulated human digestion of N1-aryl-2-arylthioacetamidobenzimidazoles and their activity against Herpes-simplex virus 1 in vitro.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31048874,PloS one,2019 05 19,"Drug performance in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) plays a crucial role in determining release and absorption. In the present work, we assessed the in vitro digestion of two synthetic N1-aryl-2-arylthioacetamidobenzimidazoles (NAABs), NAAB-496 and NAAB-503, using bio-relevant models of the human stomach and small intestine. The activity of NAAB-496 and NAAB-503 against herpes simplex virus (HSV-1) replication was also investigated. NAAB-496 was resistant to pepsin in the gastric environment, with a virtual 100% recovery, which decreased to 43.2% in the small intestine. NAAB-503 was sensitive to pepsin, with 65.7% degradation after 120 min gastric phase. 1H Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) post in vitro digestion highlighted an alteration of NAAB-496 after the gastric phase, whereas NAAB-503 appeared comparable to the original spectral data. Both NAAB-496 and NAAB-503 revealed some antiviral activity anti-HSV-1. The 50% effective concentration (EC50) of the compounds was 0.058 mg/mL for NAAB-496 and 0.066 for NAAB-503. Future studies will evaluate the behavior of NAAB-496 within pharmaceutical formulations.",Prevalence of thyroid dysfunction in older Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes-A multicenter cross-sectional observational study across China.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31048873,PloS one,2019 05 19,"Type 2 diabetes [T2D] and thyroid dysfunction [TD] often co-occur, have overlapping pathologies, and their risk increases with age. Since 1995, universal salt iodization has been implemented in China to prevent disorders caused by iodine deficiency. However, after two decades of implementation of universal salt iodization, the prevalence of TD in elderly Chinese patients with T2D is not well described and may have been underestimated. We conducted a questionnaire-based survey across 24 endocrinology centers in China between December 2015 and July 2016. Demographic and clinical data from 1677 patients with T2D were obtained and analyzed to examine the prevalence of TD along with T2D in these patients. We assessed TD prevalence according to the four TD subtypes [subclinical hypothyroidism, clinical hypothyroidism, subclinical hyperthyroidism, and clinical hyperthyroidism], TD history, gender, and age. The diagnosis rates were calculated for TD and also for the TD subtype. The number of patients reaching treatment goals for T2D [hemoglobin A1c <7%] and TD [normal free thyroxine and thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH]] and the incidences of complications and comorbidities were recorded. Among the enrolled patients with T2D [N = 1677], TD was diagnosed in 23.79% [399/1677] out of which 61% (245/399) were previously diagnosed and 38.59% (154/399) were newly diagnosed cases. Subclinical hypothyroidism, clinical hypothyroidism, subclinical hyperthyroidism, and clinical hyperthyroidism were reported in 4.89%, 9.3%, 1.13%, and 3.16% of the total population, respectively. Among patients previously diagnosed with TD, the incidence in women [166/795; 20.88%] was higher than in men [79/882; 8.96%]. The treatment goals for TD and T2D were attained in 39.6% [97/245] and 34.41% [577/1677] of the cases, respectively. Diabetic complications and comorbidities were reported in 99.7% of patients, with peripheral neuropathy being the most common [43.46%] followed by cataract [24.73%]. We had found that the incidences of dyslipidemia, elevated LDL levels, and osteoporosis were significantly higher in patients with TD than those without TD.

Our motivation is twofold: we aim at conceiving the simplest genetic circuits for synthetic biology and at understanding the natural auto-regulation of the LrpB protein of the Sulfolobus solfataricus archaeon which exhibits non-monotonicity. We analyzed three toy models, based on mass-action kinetics, with increasing complexity and sought for oscillations and (fast) bistable switching. We performed large parameter scans and sensitivity analyses, and quantified the quality of the oscillators and switches by computing relative volumes in parameter space reproducing the sought dynamical behavior. All single gene systems need finely tuned parameters in order to oscillate, but bistable switches are more robust against parameter changes. We expected non-monotonic switches to be faster than monotonic ones, however solutions combining both auto-activation and repression in the physiological range to obtain fast switches are scarce. Our analysis shows that the Ss-LrpB system can not provide a bistable switch and that robust oscillations are unlikely. Gillespie simulations suggest that the function of the natural Ss-LrpB system is sensing via a spiking behavior, which is in line with the fact that this protein has a metabolic regulatory function and binds to a ligand.",Topical paromomycin for New World cutaneous leishmaniasis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31048871,PLoS neglected tropical diseases,2019 05 19,"Paromomycin-based topical treatments were shown to be effective in curing cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) lesions caused by Leishmania major in Tunisia.

The frequency and magnitude of sport-related head impacts have not been described for water polo. We aimed to compare patterns of empirically measured head impact exposure of male collegiate water polo players to patterns previously reported by a survey of current and former water polo athletes. Participants wore water polo caps instrumented with head impact sensors during three seasons of collegiate water polo. Peak linear acceleration (PLA) and peak rotational acceleration (PRA) were recorded for head impacts. Athlete positions were recorded by research staff at the occurrence of each head impact. Head impacts were sustained by athletes in offensive positions more frequently than in defensive and transition positions (246, 59.9% vs. 93, 22.6% vs. 72, 17.5%). 37% of all head impacts during gameplay were sustained by athletes playing the offensive center position. Impact magnitude (means ± SD: PLA = 36.1±12.3g, PRA = 5.0±2.9 krads/sec2) did not differ between position or game scenario. Among goalies, impact frequency and magnitude were similar between games (means ± SD: 0.54±.51 hits/game, PLA = 36.9±14.2g, PRA = 4.3±4.2 krads/sec2) and practices (means ± SD: 0.96±1.11 hits/practice, PLA = 43.7±14.5g, PRA = 3.9±2.5 krads/sec2). We report that collegiate water polo athletes are at risk for sport-related head impacts and impact frequency is dependent on game scenario and player position. In contrast, magnitude does not differ between scenarios or across positions.",Individual knock out of glycine receptor alpha subunits identifies a specific requirement of glra1 for motor function in zebrafish.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31048868,PloS one,2019 05 19,"Glycine receptors (GlyRs) are ligand-gated chloride channels mediating inhibitory neurotransmission in the brain stem and spinal cord. They function as pentamers composed of alpha and beta subunits for which 5 genes have been identified in human (GLRA1, GLRA2, GLRA3, GLRA4, GLRB). Several in vitro studies showed that the pentameric subtype composition as well as its stoichiometry influence the distribution and the molecular function of the receptor. Moreover, mutations in some of these genes are involved in different human conditions ranging from tinnitus to epilepsy and hyperekplexia, suggesting distinct functions of the different subunits. Although the beta subunit is essential for synaptic clustering of the receptor, the specific role of each alpha subtype is still puzzling in vivo. The zebrafish genome encodes for five glycine receptor alpha subunits (glra1, glra2, glra3, glra4a, glra4b) thus offering a model of choice to investigate the respective role of each subtype on general motor behaviour. After establishing a phylogeny of GlyR subunit evolution between human and zebrafish, we checked the temporal expression pattern of these transcripts during embryo development. Interestingly, we found that glra1 is the only maternally transmitted alpha subunit. We also showed that the expression of the different GlyR subunits starts at different time points during development. Lastly, in order to decipher the role of each alpha subunit on the general motor behaviour of the fish, we knocked out individually each alpha subunit by CRISPR/Cas9-targeted mutagenesis. Surprisingly, we found that knocking out any of the alpha2, 3, a4a or a4b subunit did not lead to any obvious developmental or motor phenotype. However, glra1-/- (hitch) embryos depicted a strong motor dysfunction from 3 days, making them incapable to swim and thus leading to their premature death. Our results infer a strong functional redundancy between alpha subunits and confirm the central role played by glra1 for proper inhibitory neurotransmission controlling locomotion. The genetic tools we developed here will be of general interest for further studies aiming at dissecting the role of GlyRs in glycinergic transmission in vivo and the hitch mutant (hic) is of specific relevance as a new model of hyperekplexia.",Simple and efficient estimation of photovoltaic cells and modules parameters using approximation and correction technique.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31048867,PloS one,2019 05 19,"The behavior of solar cells and modules under various operational conditions can be determined effectively when their intrinsic parameters are accurately estimated and used to simulate the current-voltage (I-V) characteristics. This work proposed a new computational approach based on approximation and correction technique (ACT) for simple and efficient extraction of solar cells and modules parameters from the single-diode model. In this technique, an approximated value of series resistance (Rs) was first derived and used to determine the initial value of parallel resistance (Rp). Later, the final corrected values of Rs and Rp were obtained by resubstituting their approximated values in a five-loop iteration using the manipulated equations. For rapid evaluation and validation of the proposed technique, a software application was also created using MATLAB program. The correctness and robustness of the proposed technique was validated on five types of solar cells and modules operated at varied temperatures and irradiances. The lowest RMSE value was achieved for RTC France (7.78937E-4) and PVM 752 GaAs (2.10497E-4) solar cell. The legitimacy of ACT extracted parameters was established using a simple yet competitive implementation approach wherein the performance of the developed technique was compared with several state-of-the-art methods recently reported in the literature."

In cancer, polymorphonuclear myeloid-derived suppressor cells (PMN-MDSCs) contribute to the maintenance of the tumor microenvironment by suppressing T cells. However, the presence of these cells has never been examined in ischemic brain. Therefore, we examined the temporal and spatial profiles of PMN-MDSCs, which are defined as the CD11b+Ly6ClowLy6G+ cells with higher expression levels of Nox2 and C/EBP Homologous Protein (CHOP) mRNA than normal neutrophil. Fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis showed that the count of CD11b+Ly6ClowLy6G+ cells was increased in the ischemic hemisphere and bone marrow at 72 hours, as well as in the spleen 24 hours after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion in mice. In contrast, the contralateral hemisphere, normal bone marrow, and normal spleen contained few CD11b+Ly6ClowLy6G+ cells. Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction revealed that CD11b+Ly6ClowLy6G+ cells sorted from brain and spleen 72 hours after ischemia had greater expression of Nox2 and CHOP mRNA than neutrophils in bone marrow, suggesting that these cells constitute PMN-MDSCs. Immunohistochemistry showed that CD11b+Ly6G+ cells were located in the ischemic core and border zone, indicating that PMN-MDSCs might be endemic to these regions. Although neutrophils are believed to invade infarct regions 48-72 hours after ischemia, the present study suggested that some of these cells are in fact PMN-MDSCs. Further studies on the function of PMN-MDSCs might unveil the unknown mechanisms of T cell activation and recruitment in ischemic stroke.",Risk factors for emotional and behavioral problems in moderately-late preterms.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31048855,PloS one,2019 05 19,"To assess which factors, including maternal, lifestyle, pregnancy- and delivery-related, fetal and neonatal factors adjusted for socio-economic status, are related to emotional and behavioral problems in moderately-late preterm born children (MLPs; gestational age 32.0-35.9 weeks) at 4 years of age.

The goal of the present study was to investigate if the body representation selected to plan reaches to somatosensory targets is influenced by the sensory modality of the cue indicating the target's location. In the first experiment, participants reached to somatosensory targets prompted by either an auditory or a vibrotactile cue. As a baseline condition, participants also performed reaches to visual targets prompted by an auditory cue. Gaze-dependent reaching errors were measured to determine the contribution of the exteroceptive representation to motor planning processes. The results showed that reaches to both auditory-cued somatosensory targets and auditory-cued visual targets exhibited larger gaze-dependent reaching errors than reaches to vibrotactile-cued somatosensory targets. Thus, an exteroceptive body representation was likely used to plan reaches to auditory-cued somatosensory targets but not to vibrotactile-cued somatosensory targets. The second experiment examined the influence of using an exteroceptive body representation to plan movements to somatosensory targets on pre-movement neural activations. Cortical responses to a task-irrelevant visual flash were measured as participants planned movements to either auditory-cued somatosensory or auditory-cued visual targets. Larger responses (i.e., visual-evoked potentials) were found when participants planned movements to somatosensory vs. visual targets, and source analyses revealed that these activities were localized to the left occipital and left posterior parietal areas. These results suggest that visual and visuomotor processing networks were more engaged when using the exteroceptive body representation to plan movements to somatosensory targets, than when planning movements to external visual targets.",Healthcare utilization of breast cancer patients following telephone-based consultations of oncology nurse navigator via telemedical care.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31048852,PloS one,2019 06 10,To characterize breast cancer patients who received telephone-based consultations of oncology nurse navigator via telemedical care (TMC patients) and analyze their healthcare utilization (HCU) one year before and after receiving this service.,"Medical students' empathy and attitudes towards professionalism: Relationship with personality, specialty preference and medical programme.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31048851,PloS one,2019 05 19,"Existing research has suggested that self-reported empathy in medical students is moderated by personality traits and diverse demographic and educational factors including age, gender, nationality, career aspirations, as well as year of curriculum.

These indicator properties are generally assumed for assemblage-based indicators such as diatom transfer functions that use species abundance data to infer environmental variables. However, failure of assemblage approaches necessitates the interpretation of individual dominant taxa when making environmental inferences. To determine whether diatom species from Laurentian Great Lakes sediment cores have the potential to provide unambiguous inferences of anthropogenic stress, we evaluated fossil diatom abundance against a suite of historical environmental gradients: human population, agriculture, mining, atmospheric nutrient deposition, atmospheric temperature and ice cover. Several diatom species, such as Stephanodiscus parvus, had reliable relationships with anthropogenic stress such as human population. However, many species had little or no indicator value or had confusing relationships with multiple environmental variables, suggesting one should be careful when using those species to infer stress in the Great Lakes. Recommendations for future approaches to refining diatom indicators are discussed, including accounting for the effects of broad species geographic distributions to minimize region-specific responses that can weaken indicator power.",Combined methods to evaluate human cells in muscle xenografts.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31048846,PloS one,2019 05 19,"Xenotransplantation of human cells into immunodeficient mouse models is a very powerful tool and an essential step for the pre-clinical evaluation of therapeutic cell- and gene- based strategies.

Whereas real-time quantitative PCR-based method provides an accurate quantification of human cells, it does not document their specific localization. The addition of an immunofluorescence approach using human-specific antibodies recognizing engrafted human cells gives information on the localization of the human cells within the host muscle fibres, in the stem cell niche or in the interstitial space.

Due to the long time delay of the WMD-based Emotional Trigger System, we propose an enhanced Emotional Trigger System to enable a smooth interaction with the robot in which the Emotional Trigger is replaced by a conventional convolution neural network and a long short term memory network (CNN_LSTM)-based deep neural network. In our experiments, the CNN_LSTM based model only need 10 milliseconds or less to finish the classification without a decrease in accuracy, while the WMD-based model needed approximately 6-8 seconds to give a result. In this paper, the experiments are conducted based on the same sub-data sets of the Chinese emotional corpus(Ren_CECps) used in former WMD experiments: one comprises 50% data for training and 50% for testing(1v1 experiment), and the other comprises 80% data for training and 20% for testing(4v1 experiment). The experiments are conducted using WMD, CNN_LSTM, CNN and LSTM.

[Formula: see text] (ΔSO) is measured to decrease (increase) by approximately 200 meV (240 meV) with the incorporation of 1% Bi, corresponding to a greater than fourfold increase in ΔSO in going from GaP to GaP0.99Bi0.01. The evolution of [Formula: see text] and ΔSO with x is characterised by strong, composition-dependent bowing. We demonstrate that a simple valence band-anticrossing model, parametrised directly from atomistic supercell calculations, quantitatively describes the measured evolution of [Formula: see text] and ΔSO with x. In contrast to the well-studied GaAs1-xBix alloy, in GaP1-xBix substitutional Bi creates localised impurity states lying energetically within the GaP host matrix band gap. This leads to the emergence of an optically active band of Bi-hybridised states, accounting for the overall large bowing of [Formula: see text] and ΔSO and in particular for the giant bowing observed for x ≲ 1%. Our analysis provides insight into the action of Bi as an isovalent impurity, and constitutes the first detailed experimental and theoretical analysis of the GaP1-xBix alloy band structure.",Stacking stability of C2N bilayer nanosheet.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31048761,Scientific reports,2019 05 19,"In recent years, a 2D graphene-like sheet: monolayer C2N was synthesized via a simple wet-chemical reaction. Here, we studied the stability and electronic properties of bilayer C2N. According to a previous study, a bilayer may exist in one of three highly symmetric stacking configurations, namely as AA, AB and AB'-stacking. For the AA-stacking, the top layer is directly stacked on the bottom layer. Furthermore, AB- and AB'-stacking can be obtained by shifting the top layer of AA-stacking by a/3-b/3 along zigzag direction and by a/2 along armchair direction, respectively, where a and b are translation vectors of the unit cell. By using first-principles calculations, we calculated the stability of AA, AB and AB'-stacking C2N and their electronic band structure. We found that the AB-stacking is the most favorable structure and has the highest band gap, which appeared to agree with previous study. Nevertheless, we furthermore examine the energy landscape and translation sliding barriers between stacking layers. From energy profiles, we interestingly found that the most stable positions are shifted from the high symmetry AB-stacking. In electronic band structure details, band characteristic can be modified according to the shift. The interlayer shear mode close to local minimum point was determined to be roughly 2.02 × 1012 rad/s.",Cost-effective fibrinolytic enzyme production by Bacillus subtilis WR350 using medium supplemented with corn steep powder and sucrose.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31048760,Scientific reports,2019 05 19,"The goal of this study was to develop a cheap and simple medium and to optimize fermentation parameters for fibrinolytic enzyme production by Bacillus subtilis WR350. A low-cost medium containing 35 g/L sucrose, 20 g/L corn steep powder and 2 g/L MgSO4·7H2O was developed via single-factor and orthogonal experiments. A cheap nitrogen source, corn steep powder, was used to replace the soy peptone present in the initial medium. The highest fibrinolytic activity of 5865 U/mL was achieved using the optimized medium in a 100-L fermenter with an aeration rate of 1.0 vvm and an agitation speed of 200 rpm. The resulting enzyme yield was among the highest described in the literature with respect to fibrinolytic activity, as determined by the fibrin plate method. Techno-economic evaluation indicated that the cost of the optimized medium was only 8.5% of the cost of the initial medium, and the total fermentation cost of fibrinolytic enzyme production using the optimized medium was 23.35% of the cost of using the initial medium.",Associations of the adrenomedullin gene polymorphism with prehypertension and hypertension in Lithuanian children and adolescents: a cross-sectional study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31048758,Scientific reports,2019 05 19,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the association of ADM genetic variant and HBP among Lithuanian adolescents aged 12-15 years. This is a cross-sectional study of a randomly selected sample of 675 12-15-years-old schoolchildren who were surveyed during November 2010 to April 2012 in the baseline survey. Single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of ADM gene (rs7129220) was evaluated using real-time PCR. Logistic regression analyses were used to test the associations of ADM (rs7129220) polymorphism with HBP under four inheritance models based on the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and to calculate the odds ratios. In the multivariate analysis, boys carrying ADM AG genotype (vs. carriers of ADM GG genotype), ADM AG + AA genotype (vs. carriers of ADM GG genotype) and ADM AG genotype (vs. carriers of ADM GG + AA genotype) had higher odds of having hypertension in codominant, dominant, and overdominant inheritance models. Girls with ADM AG + AA had increased odds of prehypertension compared to girls with the ADM GG genotype carriers in dominant inheritance model. Significant associations were observed in additive models separately for boys (hypertension) and girls (prehypertension).

Open-access data may be cost-effective to address those limitations. We test the use of open-access satellite imagery (NDVI texture variables) and biodiversity data, assembled from GBIF, to investigate the relative importance of variables of habitat extent and structure as indicators of bird community richness and dissimilarity in the Alentejo region (Portugal). Results show that, at the landscape scale, forest bird richness is better indicated by the availability of tree cover in the overall landscape than by the extent or structure of the forest habitats. Open-land birds also respond to landscape structure, namely to the spectral homogeneity and size of open-land patches and to the presence of perennial vegetation amid herbaceous habitats. Moreover, structure variables were more important than climate variables or geographic distance to explain community dissimilarity patterns at the regional scale. Overall, summer imagery, when perennial vegetation is more discernible, is particularly suited to inform indicators of forest and open-land bird community richness and dissimilarity, while spring imagery appears to be also useful to inform indicators of open-land bird richness.",An archaeal symbiont-host association from the deep terrestrial subsurface.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31048756,The ISME journal,2019 05 03,"DPANN archaea have reduced metabolic capacities and are diverse and abundant in deep aquifer ecosystems, yet little is known about their interactions with other microorganisms that reside there. Here, we provide evidence for an archaeal host-symbiont association from a deep aquifer system at the Colorado Plateau (Utah, USA). The symbiont, Candidatus Huberiarchaeum crystalense, and its host, Ca. Altiarchaeum hamiconexum, show a highly significant co-occurrence pattern over 65 metagenome samples collected over six years. The physical association of the two organisms was confirmed with genome-informed fluorescence in situ hybridization depicting small cocci of Ca. H. crystalense attached to Ca. A. hamiconexum cells. Based on genomic information, Ca. H. crystalense potentially scavenges vitamins, sugars, nucleotides, and reduced redox-equivalents from its host and thus has a similar metabolism as Nanoarchaeum equitans. These results provide insight into host-symbiont interactions among members of two uncultivated archaeal phyla that thrive in a deep subsurface aquifer.",Acidic Stress Triggers Sodium-Coupled Bicarbonate Transport and Promotes Survival in A375 Human Melanoma Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31048755,Scientific reports,2019 05 19,"Melanoma cells preserve intracellular pH (pHi) within a viable range despite an acidic ambient pH that typically falls below pH 7.0. The molecular mechanisms underlying this form of acidic preservation in melanoma remain poorly understood. Previous studies had demonstrated that proton transporters including the monocarboxylate transporter (MCT), the sodium hydrogen exchanger (NHE), and V-Type ATPase mediate acid extrusion to counter intracellular acidification in melanoma cells. In this report, the expression and function of the Sodium-Coupled Bicarbonate Transporter (NCBT) family of base loaders were further characterized in melanoma cell lines. NCBT family members were found to be expressed in three different melanoma cell lines - A375, MeWo, and HS695T - and included the electrogenic sodium-bicarbonate cotransporter isoforms 1 and 2 (NBCe1 and NBCe2), the electroneutral sodium-bicarbonate cotransporter (NBCn1), and the sodium-dependent chloride-bicarbonate exchanger (NDCBE). These transporters facilitated 4,4'-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid (DIDS)-dependent pHi recovery in melanoma cells, in response to intracellular acidification induced by ammonium chloride prepulse. Furthermore, the expression of NCBTs were upregulated via chronic exposure to extracellular acidification. Given the current research interest in the NCBTs as a molecular driver of tumourigenesis, characterising NCBT in melanoma provides impetus for developing novel therapeutic targets for melanoma treatment.",Mathematical expertise modulates the architecture of dorsal and cortico-thalamic white matter tracts.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31048754,Scientific reports,2019 05 19,"To what extent are levels of cognitive expertise reflected in differential structural connectivity of the brain? We addressed this question by analyzing the white matter brain structure of experts (mathematicians) versus non-experts (non-mathematicians) using probabilistic tractography. Having mathematicians and non-mathematicians as participant groups enabled us to directly compare profiles of structural connectivity arising from individual levels of expertise in mathematics. Tracking from functional seed regions activated during the processing of complex arithmetic formulas revealed an involvement of various fiber bundles such the inferior fronto-occipital fascicle, arcuate fasciculus/superior longitudinal fasciculus (AF/SLF), cross-hemispheric connections of frontal lobe areas through the corpus callosum and cortico-subcortical connectivity via the bilateral thalamic radiation. With the aim of investigating expertise-dependent structural connectivity, the streamline density was correlated with the level of expertise, defined by automaticity of processing complex mathematics. The results showed that structural integrity of the AF/SLF was higher in individuals with higher automaticity, while stronger cortico-thalamic connectivity was associated with lower levels of automaticity. Therefore, we suggest that expertise in the domain of mathematics is reflected in plastic changes of the brain's white matter structure, possibly reflecting a general principle of cognitive expertise.",The relationship between Plasma Markers and Essential Hypertension in Middle-aged and Elderly Chinese Population: A Community Based Cross-sectional Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31048753,Scientific reports,2019 05 19,"Plasma markers have been continuously advocated as pointers to estimate the long-term risk of cardiovascular disease in the general population.

A total of 2624 Chinese (62.02 ± 5.73 years old) were recruited into a population-based, cross-sectional study. Plasma hs-CRP, Hcy, HbA1c, and SUA levels were significantly higher in the hypertension group compared with control in the entire population and men (P = 0.05 for all). We observed a positive association between the highest quartiles of Hcy, NT-proBNP, HBA1c concentrations, and the prevalence of hypertension, OR (95% CI) = 1.48 (1.16-1.90), 1.62 (1.27-2.07) and 1.94 (1.49-2.52), respectively. The multivariable-adjusted OR of hypertension for the fourth versus the first quartile of homocysteine were 2.00 and 1.39 in men and women, respectively. In conclusion, our study found an independent and robust association between elevated Hcy, NT-ProBNP, and HBA1c levels and prevalence of hypertension in the middle-aged and elderly Chinese population. A follow-up study is necessary to endorse the observed association.","Computational prediction and in vitro validation of VEGFR1 as a novel protein target for 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31048752,Scientific reports,2019 05 19,"The toxic manifestations of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), an environmental contaminant, primarily depend on its ability to activate aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), which is a ligand-dependent transcription factor belonging to the superfamily of basic-helix-loop-helix DNA-binding proteins. In the present study, we aimed to identify novel protein receptor targets for TCDD using computational and in vitro validation experiments. Interestingly, results from computational methods predicted that Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor 1 (VEGFR1) could be one of the potential targets for TCDD in both mouse and humans. Results from molecular docking studies showed that human VEGFR1 (hVEGFR1) has less affinity towards TCDD compared to the mouse VEGFR1 (mVEGFR1). In vitro validation results showed that TCDD can bind and phosphorylate hVEGFR1. Further, results from molecular dynamic simulation studies showed that hVEGFR1 interaction with TCDD is stable throughout the simulation time. Overall, the present study has identified VEGFR1 as a novel target for TCDD, which provides the basis for further elucidating the role of TCDD in angiogenesis."

To better understand this connection, researchers developed the Hi-C method that is able to detect the pairwise physical contacts of all chromosomal loci. The Hi-C data show that chromosomes are composed of 3D compartments that range over a variety of scales. However, it is challenging to systematically detect these cross-scale structures. Most studies have therefore designed methods for specific scales to study foremost topologically associated domains (TADs) and A/B compartments. To go beyond this limitation, we tailor a network community detection method that finds communities in compact fractal globule polymer systems. Our method allows us to continuously scan through all scales with a single resolution parameter. We found: (i) polymer segments belonging to the same 3D community do not have to be in consecutive order along the polymer chain. In other words, several TADs may belong to the same 3D community. (ii) CTCF proteins-a loop-stabilizing protein that is ascribed a big role in TAD formation-are well correlated with community borders only at one level of organization. (iii) TADs and A/B compartments are traditionally treated as two weakly related 3D structures and detected with different algorithms. With our method, we detect both by simply adjusting the resolution parameter. We therefore argue that they represent two specific levels of a continuous spectrum 3D communities, rather than seeing them as different structural entities.",Terahertz Radiation from Combined Metallic Slit Arrays.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31048737,Scientific reports,2019 05 19,"We report an approach to efficiently generate terahertz radiation from a combined periodic structure. The proposed configuration is composed of two metallic slit arrays deliberately designed with different periodic length, slit width and depth. We found that the combination of the two slit arrays could provide special electromagnetic modes, which exhibit nonradiative property above the surface of one slit array and radiative property inside the other one. An electron beam holding proper energy could resonate with those modes to generate strong and directional electromagnetic radiations in the terahertz regime, indicating that the approach has the potential in developing high-performance terahertz radiation sources.",Comparing ant behaviour indices for fine-scale analyses.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31048736,Scientific reports,2019 05 19,"Animal behaviour often is characterised by standardised assays. In social insects such as ants, behaviour assays are for example used to characterise aggressive and peaceful behaviour. Such assays differ in the number of individuals, the duration and place of assays, and the scoring scales. Also the behaviour indices used to summarise the results differ. Here, we compared five behaviour indices (Aggression Index, Mean Maximum Aggression Index; and the newly introduced Mean Maximum Peace Index, Mean Behaviour Index aggressive, and Mean Behaviour Index peaceful) using a scoring scale that comprises peaceful and aggressive behaviour. The indices were applied on eight simulations and three observed data sets. The five indices were correlated but frequently differed in their means. Multiple indices were needed to capture the complete behaviour range. Furthermore, subtle differences in workers' behaviour, that is, differences that go beyond the presence/absence of aggression, were only identified when considering multiple indices. We infer that the indices applied are differently suited for different analyses. Fine-scale analyses of behavioural variation profit from using more than one index. The particular choice of index or indices likely influences the interpretation of behaviour and should be carefully done in the light of study species and research question.",Beta-band activity in medial prefrontal cortex predicts source memory encoding and retrieval accuracy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31048735,Scientific reports,2019 05 19,"Reality monitoring is defined as the ability to distinguish internally self-generated information from externally-derived information. The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is a key brain region subserving reality monitoring and has been shown to be activated specifically during the retrieval of self-generated information. However, it is unclear if mPFC is activated during the encoding of self-generated information into memory. If so, it is important to understand whether successful retrieval of self-generated information critically depends on enhanced neural activity within mPFC during initial encoding of this self-generated information. We used magnetoencephalographic imaging (MEGI) to determine the timing and location of cortical activity during a reality-monitoring task involving self generated contextual source memory encoding and retrieval. We found both during encoding and retrieval of self-generated information, when compared to externally-derived information, mPFC showed significant task induced oscillatory power modulation in the beta-band. During initial encoding of self-generated information, greater mPFC beta-band power reductions occurred within a time window of -700 ms to -500 ms prior to vocalization. This increased activity in mPFC was not observed during encoding of externally-derived information. Additionally, increased mPFC activity during encoding of self-generated information predicted subsequent retrieval accuracy of this self-generated information. Beta-band activity in mPFC was also observed during the initial retrieval of self-generated information within a time window of 300 to 500 ms following stimulus onset and correlated with accurate retrieval performance of self-generated information. Together, these results further highlight the importance of mPFC in mediating the initial generation and awareness of participants' internal thoughts.",Structural basis for functional interactions in dimers of SLC26 transporters.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31048734,Nature communications,2019 06 13,"The SLC26 family of transporters maintains anion equilibria in all kingdoms of life. The family shares a 7 + 7 transmembrane segments inverted repeat architecture with the SLC4 and SLC23 families, but holds a regulatory STAS domain in addition. While the only experimental SLC26 structure is monomeric, SLC26 proteins form structural and functional dimers in the lipid membrane. Here we resolve the structure of an SLC26 dimer embedded in a lipid membrane and characterize its functional relevance by combining PELDOR/DEER distance measurements and biochemical studies with MD simulations and spin-label ensemble refinement. Our structural model reveals a unique interface different from the SLC4 and SLC23 families. The functionally relevant STAS domain is no prerequisite for dimerization. Characterization of heterodimers indicates that protomers in the dimer functionally interact. The combined structural and functional data define the framework for a mechanistic understanding of functional cooperativity in SLC26 dimers.",Thymosin β-4 is a novel regulator for primary cilium formation by nephronophthisis 3 in HeLa human cervical cancer cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31048733,Scientific reports,2019 05 19,"Thymosinβ-4(Tβ4) is an actin-sequestering protein involved in tumor malignancy. Primary cilia, microtubule-based organelles, are present in most eukaryotic cells, which might be related to tumor cell transformation. Here, we investigated whether ciliogenesis is affected by Tβ4 in HeLa human cervical cancer cells. The inhibition of Tβ4 attenuated primary cilia formation. The frequency of cilia was increased by Tβ4 overexpression. When yeast two-hybrid assay was performed by using Tβ4 as a bait, we rescued nephronophthisis 3(NPHP3), one of the components of primary cilia. Interaction of Tβ4 with NPHP3 in mammalian cells was confirmed by GST-pulldown assay. Their intracellular co-localization was observed by immunofluorescence staining at peripheral surface of cells. In addition, the number of ciliated cells was reduced by the inhibition of NPHP3. Moreover, NPHP3 expression was decreased by the inhibition of Tβ4 but it was increased by Tβ4 overexpression. Taken together, the results demonstrate that primary cilia formation could be regulated by Tβ4 through its interaction with NPHP3 and/or the control of NPHP3 expression. It suggests that Tβ4 is a novel regulator for primary cilia formation by NPHP3. It also suggests that tumorigenesis could be associated with inappropriate regulation of Tβ4 and/or NPHP3 expression to maintain primary cilia formation normally.",Immunogenicity profiling of protein antigens from capsular group B Neisseria meningitidis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31048732,Scientific reports,2019 05 19,"Outer membrane vesicle (OMV)- based vaccines have been used to provide strain-specific protection against capsular group B Neisseria meningitidis infections, but the full breadth of the immune response against the components of the OMV has not been established. Sera from adults vaccinated with an OMV vaccine were used to screen 91 outer membrane proteins (OMPs) incorporated in an antigen microarray panel. Antigen-specific IgG levels were quantified pre-vaccination, and after 12 and 18 weeks. These results were compared with IgG levels from mice vaccinated with the same OMV vaccine. The repertoires of highly responding antigens in humans and mice overlapped, but were not identical. The highest responding antigens to human IgG comprised four integral OMPs (PorA, PorB, OpcA and PilQ), a protein which promotes the stability of PorA and PorB (RmpM) and two lipoproteins (BamC and GNA1162). These observations will assist in evaluating the role of minor antigen components within OMVs in providing protection against meningococcal infection. In addition, the relative dominance of responses to integral OMPs in humans emphasizes the importance of this subclass and points to the value of maintaining conformational epitopes from integral membrane proteins in vaccine formulations.",Node centrality measures are a poor substitute for causal inference.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31048731,Scientific reports,2019 05 19,"Network models have become a valuable tool in making sense of a diverse range of social, biological, and information systems. These models marry graph and probability theory to visualize, understand, and interpret variables and their relations as nodes and edges in a graph. Many applications of network models rely on undirected graphs in which the absence of an edge between two nodes encodes conditional independence between the corresponding variables. To gauge the importance of nodes in such a network, various node centrality measures have become widely used, especially in psychology and neuroscience. It is intuitive to interpret nodes with high centrality measures as being important in a causal sense. Using the causal framework based on directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), we show that the relation between causal influence and node centrality measures is not straightforward. In particular, the correlation between causal influence and several node centrality measures is weak, except for eigenvector centrality. Our results provide a cautionary tale: if the underlying real-world system can be modeled as a DAG, but researchers interpret nodes with high centrality as causally important, then this may result in sub-optimal interventions.",The Effect of Ganoderma Microsporum immunomodulatory proteins on alleviating PM2.5-induced inflammatory responses in pregnant rats and fine particulate matter-induced neurological damage in the offsprings.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31048730,Scientific reports,2019 05 19,"Fine particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5) induces free radicals and oxidative stress in animals, leading to a range of illnesses.

The results suggested that GMI administration decreased the risk of neurological disorders in mother rats and their offspring by reducing the white blood cell count, lessening inflammatory responses and PM2.5-induced memory impairment, and preventing dendritic branches in the hippocampi from declining and microRNAs from PM2.5-induced modulation.",Shade tolerance in Swarnaprabha rice is associated with higher rate of panicle emergence and positively regulated by genes of ethylene and cytokinin pathway.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31048729,Scientific reports,2019 05 19,"This study identifies characteristics of seedling, mature plant phenotypes, changes at genetic and genomic level associated with Swarnaprabha (SP) rice grown under prolonged shade and compared with Nagina 22 (N22).

Significant up-regulation of ETHYLENE RESPONSE ELEMENT BINDING PROTEIN-2, MOTHER OF FLOWERING TIME 1, and SHORT PANICLE1 genes in shade grown panicles of SP could explain its sustainable higher yield in shade."

Rather, models of discrete shifts between adaptive zones may better explain macroevolutionary dynamics across radiations. To investigate which of these processes underlie exceptional levels of morphological diversity during ecological diversification, we use modern phylogenetic tools and 3D geometric morphometric datasets to examine adaptive zone shifts in bat skull shape. Here we report that, while disparity was established early, bat skull evolution is best described by multiple adaptive zone shifts. Shifts are partially decoupled between the cranium and mandible, with cranial evolution more strongly driven by echolocation than diet. Phyllostomidae, a trophic adaptive radiation, exhibits more adaptive zone shifts than all other families combined. This pattern was potentially driven by ecological opportunity and facilitated by a shift to intermediate cranial shapes compared to oral-emitters and other nasal emitters.",Transmission of natural scene images through a multimode fibre.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31048712,Nature communications,2019 05 15,"The optical transport of images through a multimode fibre remains an outstanding challenge with applications ranging from optical communications to neuro-imaging. State of the art approaches either involve measurement and control of the full complex field transmitted through the fibre or, more recently, training of artificial neural networks that however, are typically limited to image classes belong to the same class as the training data set. Here we implement a method that statistically reconstructs the inverse transformation matrix for the fibre. We demonstrate imaging at high frame rates, high resolutions and in full colour of natural scenes, thus demonstrating general-purpose imaging capability. Real-time imaging over long fibre lengths opens alternative routes to exploitation for example for secure communication systems, novel remote imaging devices, quantum state control processing and endoscopy.",Bio-Fenton reaction involved in the cleavage of the ethoxylate chain of nonionic surfactants by dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase from Pseudomonas nitroreducens TX1.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31048711,Scientific reports,2019 05 19,"Bacteria in the environment play a major role in the degradation of widely used man-made recalcitrant organic compounds. Pseudomonas nitroreducens TX1 is of special interest because of its high efficiency to remove nonionic ethoxylated surfactants. In this study, a novel approach was demonstrated by a bacterial enzyme involved in the formation of radicals to attack ethoxylated surfactants. The dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase was purified from the crude extract of strain TX1 by using octylphenol polyethoxylate (OPEOn) as substrate. The extent of removal of OPEOs during the degradation process was conducted by purified recombinant enzyme from E. coli BL21 (DE3) in the presence of the excess of metal mixtures (Mn2+, Mg2+, Zn2+, and Cu2+). The metabolites and the degradation rates were analyzed and determined by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. The enzyme was demonstrated to form Fenton reagent in the presence of an excess of metals. Under this in vitro condition, it was shown to be able to shorten the ethoxylate chains of OPEOn. After 2 hours of reaction, the products obtained from the degradation experiment revealed a prominent ion peak at m/z = 493.3, namely the ethoxylate chain unit is 6 (OPEO6) compared to OPEO9 (m/z = 625.3), the main undegraded surfactant in the no enzyme control. It revealed that the concentration of OPEO15 and OPEO9 decreased by 90% and 40% after 4 hours, respectively. The disappearance rates for the OPEOn homologs correlated to the length of the exothylate chains, suggesting it is not a specific enzymatic reaction which cleaves one unit by unit from the end of the ethoxylate chain. The results indicate the diverse and novel strategy by bacteria to catabolize organic compounds by using existing housekeeping enzyme(s).",An experimental study of network effects on coordination in asymmetric games.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31048710,Scientific reports,2019 05 19,"Network structure has often proven to be important in understanding the decision behavior of individuals or agents in different interdependent situations. Computational studies predict that network structure has a crucial influence on behavior in iterated 2 by 2 asymmetric 'battle of the sexes' games. We test such behavioral predictions in an experiment with 240 human subjects. We found that as expected the less 'random' the network structure, the better the experimental results are predictable by the computational models. In particular, there is an effect of network clustering on the heterogeneity of convergence behavior in the network. We also found that degree centrality and having an even degree are important predictors of the decision behavior of the subjects in the experiment. We thus find empirical validation of predictions made by computational models in a computerized experiment with human subjects.",Cisplatin Pharmacodynamics Following Endobronchial Ultrasound-Guided Transbronchial Needle Injection into Lung Tumors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31048709,Scientific reports,2019 06 10,"Intratumoral delivery of cisplatin by endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle injection (EBUS-TBNI) has recently emerged as a therapy for treating peribronchial lung cancers. It remains unclear, however, where best to inject drug into a tumor, and at how many sites, so current cisplatin delivery strategies remain empirical. Motivated by the need to put EBUS-TBNI treatment of lung cancer on a more objective footing, we developed a computational model of cisplatin pharmacodynamics following EBUS-TBNI. The model accounts for diffusion of cisplatin within and between the intracellular and extracellular spaces of a tumor, as well as clearance of cisplatin from the tumor via the vasculature and clearance from the body via the kidneys. We matched the tumor model geometry to that determined from a thoracic CT scan of a patient with lung cancer. The model was calibrated by fitting its predictions of cisplatin blood concentration versus time to measurements made up to 2 hrs following EBUS-TBNI of cisplatin into the patient's lung tumor. This gave a value for the systemic volume of distribution for cisplatin of 12.2 L and a rate constant of clearance from the tumor into the systemic compartment of 1.46 × 10-4 s-1. Our model indicates that the minimal dose required to kill all cancerous cells in a lung tumor can be reduced by roughly 3 orders of magnitude if the cisplatin is apportioned between 5 optimally spaced locations throughout the tumor rather than given as a single bolus to the tumor center. Our findings suggest that optimizing the number and location of EBUS-TBNI sites has a dramatic effect on the dose of cisplatin required for efficacious treatment of lung cancer.",LncRNA Rik-203 contributes to anesthesia neurotoxicity via microRNA-101a-3p and GSK-3β-mediated neural differentiation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31048708,Scientific reports,2019 05 19,"The mechanism of anesthesia neurotoxicity remains largely to be determined. The effects of long noncoding RNAs (LncRNAs) on neural differentiation and the underlying mechanisms are unknown. We thus identified LncRNA Rik-203 (C130071C03Rik) and studied its role on neural differentiation and its interactions with anesthetic sevoflurane, miRNA and GSK-3β. We found that levels of Rik-203 were higher in hippocampus than other tissues and increased during neural differentiation. Sevoflurane decreased the levels of Rik-203. Rik-203 knockdown reduced mRNA levels of Sox1 and Nestin, the markers of neural progenitor cells, and decreased the count of Sox1 positive cells. RNA-RNA pull-down showed that miR-101a-3p was highly bound to Rik-203. Finally, sevoflurane, knockdown of Rik-203, and miR-101a-3p overexpression all decreased GSK-3β levels. These data suggest that Rik-203 facilitates neural differentiation by inhibiting miR-101a-3p's ability to reduce GSK-3β levels and that LncRNAs would serve as the mechanism of the anesthesia neurotoxicity.",Charge-Dependent Regulation in DNA Adsorption on 2D Clay Minerals.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31048707,Scientific reports,2019 05 19,"DNA purification is essential for the detection of human clinical specimens. A non-destructive, controllable, and low reagent consuming DNA extraction method is described. Negatively charged DNA is absorbed onto a negatively charged montmorillonite to achieve non-destructive DNA extraction based on cation bridge construction and electric double layer formation. Different valence cation modified montmorillonite forms were used to validate the charge-dependent nature of DNA adsorption on montmorillonite. Electric double layer thickness thinning/thickening with the high/lower valence cations exists, and the minerals tended to be sedimentation-stable due to the Van der Waals attraction/electrostatic repulsion. Li-modified montmorillonite with the lowest charge states showed the best DNA adsorption efficiency of 8-10 ng/μg. Charge-dependent regulating research provides a new perspective for controllable DNA extraction and a deep analysis of interface engineering mechanisms.","Untargeted metabolomics reveals N, N, N-trimethyl-L-alanyl-L-proline betaine (TMAP) as a novel biomarker of kidney function.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31048706,Scientific reports,2019 05 19,"The diagnosis and prognosis of chronic kidney disease (CKD) currently relies on very few circulating small molecules, which can vary by factors unrelated to kidney function. In end-stage renal disease (ESRD), these same small molecules are used to determine dialysis dose and dialytic clearance. Therefore, we aimed to identify novel plasma biomarkers to estimate kidney function in CKD and dialytic clearance in ESRD. Untargeted metabolomics was performed on plasma samples from patients with a single kidney, non-dialysis CKD, ESRD and healthy controls. For ESRD patients, pre- and post-dialysis plasma samples were obtained from several dialysis modalities. Metabolomics analysis revealed over 400 significantly different features in non-dialysis CKD and ESRD plasma compared to controls while less than 35 features were significantly altered in patients with a single kidney. N,N,N-trimethyl-L-alanyl-L-proline betaine (TMAP, AUROC = 0.815) and pyrocatechol sulfate (AUROC = 0.888) outperformed creatinine (AUROC = 0.745) in accurately identifying patients with a single kidney. Several metabolites accurately predicted ESRD; however, when comparing pre-and post-hemodialysis, TMAP was the most robust biomarker of dialytic clearance for all modalities (AUROC = 0.993). This study describes TMAP as a novel potential biomarker of kidney function and dialytic clearance across several hemodialysis modalities.",Effects of water depth on GBD associated with total dissolved gas supersaturation in Chinese sucker (Myxocyprinus asiaticus) in upper Yangtze River.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31048705,Scientific reports,2019 05 19,"Spillway water falling from hydroelectric power plant dams in the upper Yangtze River creates a high pressure in plunge pools below the dams allowing gasses to be dissolved at high rates. The resulting supersaturation persists many miles downstream the dam which may elicit mortality in river fishes associated with gas bubble disease (GBD). We have in a two-year study (2014-15) evaluated the effect of water depth on development of GBD in an endemic and endangered fish species, the Chinese sucker Myxocyprinus asiaticus, 24 km downstream of Xiangjaiba dam. Mortality and incidence of GBD were recorded and it was seen that water depth and survival time/GBD development was positively correlated. The physiological mechanisms explaining increased resistance to GBD with increased water depths (and thereby higher hydrostatic pressure) are discussed. The results may be applied in future management of fish resources in order to protect endangered endemic fishes in rivers affected by dam constructions.",Intrinsic coating morphology modulates acute drug transfer in drug-coated balloon therapy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31048704,Scientific reports,2019 05 19,"The hallmark of drug-coated balloon (DCB) therapy for the treatment of peripheral vascular disease is that it allows for reopening of the narrowed lumen and local drug delivery without the need for a permanent indwelling metal implant such as a stent. Current DCB designs rely on transferring drugs such as paclitaxel to the arterial vessel using a variety of biocompatible excipients coated on the balloons. Inherent procedural challenges, along with limited understanding of the interactions between the coating and the artery, interactions between the coating and the balloon as well as site-specific differences, have led to DCB designs with poor drug delivery efficiency. Our study is focused on two clinically significant DCB excipients, urea and shellac, and uses uniaxial mechanical testing, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and biophysical modeling based on classic Hertz theory to elucidate how coating microstructure governs the transmission of forces at the coating-artery interface. SEM revealed shellac-based coatings to contain spherical-shaped microstructural elements whereas urea-based coatings contained conical-shaped microstructural elements. Our model based on Hertz theory showed that the interactions between these intrinsic coating elements with the arterial wall were fundamentally different, even when the same external force was applied by the balloon on the arterial wall. Using two orthogonal cell-based assays, our study also found differential viability when endothelial cells were exposed to titrated concentrations of urea and shellac, further highlighting the need to maximize coating transfer efficiency in the context of DCB therapies. Our results underscore the significance of the excipient in DCB design and suggest that coating microstructure modulates acute drug transfer during device deployment."

Tract length often correlates with transcriptional activity and expansion beyond specific thresholds in certain human proteins is the cause of polyQ disorders. To study the structural basis of the association between tract length, transcriptional activity and disease, we addressed how the conformation of the polyQ tract of the androgen receptor, associated with spinobulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA), depends on its length. Here we report that this sequence folds into a helical structure stabilized by unconventional hydrogen bonds between glutamine side chains and main chain carbonyl groups, and that its helicity directly correlates with tract length. These unusual hydrogen bonds are bifurcate with the conventional hydrogen bonds stabilizing α-helices. Our findings suggest a plausible rationale for the association between polyQ tract length and androgen receptor transcriptional activity and have implications for establishing the mechanistic basis of SBMA.",Whole-genome sequencing reveals novel tandem-duplication hotspots and a prognostic mutational signature in gastric cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31048690,Nature communications,2019 06 13,"Genome-wide analysis of genomic signatures might reveal novel mechanisms for gastric cancer (GC) tumorigenesis. Here, we analysis structural variations (SVs) and mutational signatures via whole-genome sequencing of 168 GCs. Our data demonstrates diverse models of complex SVs operative in GC, which lead to high-level amplification of oncogenes. We find varying proportion of tandem-duplications (TDs) among individuals and identify 24 TD hotspots involving well-established cancer genes such as CCND1, ERBB2 and MYC. Specifically, we nominate a novel hotspot involving the super-enhancer of ZFP36L2 presents in approximately 10% GCs from different cohorts, the oncogenic role of which is further confirmed by experimental data. In addition, our data reveal a mutational signature, specifically occurring in noncoding region, significantly enriched in tumors with cadherin 1 mutations, and associated with poor prognoses. Collectively, our data suggest that TDs might serve as an important mechanism for cancer gene activation and provide a novel signature for stratification.",MEK1/2 inhibitor withdrawal reverses acquired resistance driven by BRAFV600E amplification whereas KRASG13D amplification promotes EMT-chemoresistance.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31048689,Nature communications,2019 06 13,"Acquired resistance to MEK1/2 inhibitors (MEKi) arises through amplification of BRAFV600E or KRASG13D to reinstate ERK1/2 signalling. Here we show that BRAFV600E amplification and MEKi resistance are reversible following drug withdrawal. Cells with BRAFV600E amplification are addicted to MEKi to maintain a precise level of ERK1/2 signalling that is optimal for cell proliferation and survival, and tumour growth in vivo. Robust ERK1/2 activation following MEKi withdrawal drives a p57KIP2-dependent G1 cell cycle arrest and senescence or expression of NOXA and cell death, selecting against those cells with amplified BRAFV600E. p57KIP2 expression is required for loss of BRAFV600E amplification and reversal of MEKi resistance. Thus, BRAFV600E amplification confers a selective disadvantage during drug withdrawal, validating intermittent dosing to forestall resistance. In contrast, resistance driven by KRASG13D amplification is not reversible; rather ERK1/2 hyperactivation drives ZEB1-dependent epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and chemoresistance, arguing strongly against the use of drug holidays in cases of KRASG13D amplification.",A long-term dataset of lake surface water temperature over the Tibetan Plateau derived from AVHRR 1981-2015.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31048686,Scientific data,2019 05 14,"Lake surface water temperature (LSWT) is of vital importance for hydrological and meteorological studies. The LSWT ground measurements in the Tibetan Plateau (TP) were quite scarce because of its harsh environment. Thermal infrared remote sensing is a reliable way to calculate historical LSWT. In this study, we present the first and longest 35-year (1981-2015) daytime lake-averaged LSWT data of 97 large lakes (>80 km2 each) in the TP using the 4-km Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) Global Area Coverage (GAC) data. The LSWT dataset, taking advantage of observations from NOAA's afternoon satellites, includes three time scales, i.e., daily, 8-day-averaged, and monthly-averaged. The AVHRR-derived LSWT has a similar accuracy (RMSE = 1.7 °C) to that from other data products such as MODIS (RMSE = 1.7 °C) and ARC-Lake (RMSE = 2.0 °C). An inter-comparison of different sensors indicates that for studies such as those considering long-term climate change, the relative bias of different AVHRR sensors cannot be ignored.

To characterize the genetic composition of NPM1 mutated (NPM1mut) AML, we assess mutation status of five recurrently mutated oncogenes in 129 paired NPM1mut samples obtained at diagnosis and relapse. We find a substantial shift in the genetic pattern from diagnosis to relapse including NPM1mut loss (n = 11). To better understand these NPM1mut loss cases, we perform whole exome sequencing (WES) and RNA-Seq. At the time of relapse, NPM1mut loss patients (pts) feature distinct mutational patterns that share almost no somatic mutation with the corresponding diagnosis sample and impact different signaling pathways. In contrast, profiles of pts with persistent NPM1mut are reflected by a high overlap of mutations between diagnosis and relapse. Our findings confirm that relapse often originates from persistent leukemic clones, though NPM1mut loss cases suggest a second ""de novo"" or treatment-associated AML (tAML) as alternative cause of relapse.",Checkpoint blockade and nanosonosensitizer-augmented noninvasive sonodynamic therapy combination reduces tumour growth and metastases in mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31048681,Nature communications,2019 06 13,"Combined checkpoint blockade (e.g., PD1/PD-L1) with traditional clinical therapies can be hampered by side effects and low tumour-therapeutic outcome, hindering broad clinical translation. Here we report a combined tumour-therapeutic modality based on integrating nanosonosensitizers-augmented noninvasive sonodynamic therapy (SDT) with checkpoint-blockade immunotherapy. All components of the nanosonosensitizers (HMME/R837@Lip) are clinically approved, wherein liposomes act as carriers to co-encapsulate sonosensitizers (hematoporphyrin monomethyl ether (HMME)) and immune adjuvant (imiquimod (R837)). Using multiple tumour models, we demonstrate that combining nanosonosensitizers-augmented SDT with anti-PD-L1 induces an anti-tumour response, which not only arrests primary tumour progression, but also prevents lung metastasis. Furthermore, the combined treatment strategy offers a long-term immunological memory function, which can protect against tumour rechallenge after elimination of the initial tumours. Therefore, this work represents a proof-of-concept combinatorial tumour therapeutics based on noninvasive tumours-therapeutic modality with immunotherapy.",Rapid evaluation of bioactive Ti-based surfaces using an in vitro titration method.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31048680,Nature communications,2019 06 13,"The prediction of implant behavior in vivo by the use of easy-to-perform in vitro methods is of great interest in biomaterials research. Simulated body fluids (SBFs) have been proposed and widely used to evaluate the bone-bonding ability of implant materials. In view of its limitations, we report here a rapid in vitro method based on calcium titration for the evaluation of in vivo bioactivity. Using four different titanium surfaces, this method identifies that alkaline treatment is the key process to confer bioactivity to titanium whereas no significant effect from heat treatment is observed. The presence of bioactive titanium surfaces in the solution during calcium titration induces an earlier nucleation of crystalline calcium phosphates and changes the crystallization pathway. The conclusions from this method are also supported by the standard SBF test (ISO 23317), in vitro cell culture tests using osteoblasts and in vivo animal experiments employing a pelvic sheep model.","State-Specific Severe Joint Pain and Physical Inactivity Among Adults with Arthritis - United States, 2017.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31048678,MMWR. Morbidity and mortality weekly report,2019 06 10,"An estimated 54.4 million (approximately one in four) U.S. adults have doctor-diagnosed arthritis (arthritis) (1). Severe joint pain and physical inactivity are common among adults with arthritis and are linked to adverse mental and physical health effects and limitations (2,3). CDC analyzed 2017 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data to estimate current state-specific prevalence of arthritis and, among adults with arthritis, the prevalences of severe joint pain and physical inactivity. In 2017, the median age-standardized state prevalence of arthritis among adults aged ≥18 years was 22.8% (range = 15.7% [District of Columbia] to 34.6% [West Virginia]) and was generally highest in Appalachia and Lower Mississippi Valley regions.* Among adults with arthritis, age-standardized, state-specific prevalences of both severe joint pain (median = 30.3%; range = 20.8% [Colorado] to 45.2% [Mississippi]) and physical inactivity (median = 33.7%; range = 23.2% [Colorado] to 44.4% [Kentucky]) were highest in southeastern states. Physical inactivity prevalence among those with severe joint pain (47.0%) was higher than that among those with moderate (31.8%) or no/mild joint pain (22.6%). Self-management strategies such as maintaining a healthy weight or being physically active can reduce arthritis pain and prevent or delay arthritis-related disability. Evidence-based physical activity and self-management education programs are available that can improve quality of life among adults with arthritis.","Drug Overdose Deaths Involving Cocaine and Psychostimulants with Abuse Potential - United States, 2003-2017.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31048676,MMWR.

From 2015 to 2016, cocaine-involved and psychostimulant-involved death rates increased 52.4% and 33.3%, respectively (1). A total of 70,237 persons died from drug overdoses in the United States in 2017; approximately two thirds of these deaths involved an opioid (2). CDC analyzed 2016-2017 changes in age-adjusted death rates involving cocaine and psychostimulants by demographic characteristics, urbanization levels, U.S. Census region, 34 states, and the District of Columbia (DC). CDC also examined trends in age-adjusted cocaine-involved and psychostimulant-involved death rates from 2003 to 2017 overall, as well as with and without co-involvement of opioids. Among all 2017 drug overdose deaths, 13,942 (19.8%) involved cocaine, and 10,333 (14.7%) involved psychostimulants. Death rates increased from 2016 to 2017 for both drug categories across demographic characteristics, urbanization levels, Census regions, and states. In 2017, opioids were involved in 72.7% and 50.4% of cocaine-involved and psychostimulant-involved overdoses, respectively, and the data suggest that increases in cocaine-involved overdose deaths from 2012 to 2017 were driven primarily by synthetic opioids. Conversely, increases in psychostimulant-involved deaths from 2010 to 2017 occurred largely independent of opioids, with increased co-involvement of synthetic opioids in recent years. Provisional data from 2018 indicate that deaths involving cocaine and psychostimulants are continuing to increase.† Increases in stimulant-involved deaths are part of a growing polysubstance landscape. Increased surveillance and evidence-based multisectoral prevention and response strategies are needed to address deaths involving cocaine and psychostimulants and opioids. Enhancing linkage to care, building state and local capacity, and public health/public safety collaborations are critical components of prevention efforts.","Progress Toward Measles Elimination - European Region, 2009-2018.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31048675,MMWR. Morbidity and mortality weekly report,2019 06 10,"In 2010, all 53 countries* in the World Health Organization (WHO) European Region (EUR) reconfirmed their commitment to eliminating measles and rubella and congenital rubella syndrome (1); this goal was included as a priority in the European Vaccine Action Plan 2015-2020 (2). The WHO-recommended elimination strategies in EUR include 1) achieving and maintaining ≥95% coverage with 2 doses of measles-containing vaccine (MCV) through routine immunization services; 2) providing measles and rubella vaccination opportunities, including supplementary immunization activities (SIAs), to populations susceptible to measles or rubella; 3) strengthening surveillance by conducting case investigations and confirming suspected cases and outbreaks with laboratory results; and 4) improving the availability and use of evidence for the benefits and risks associated with vaccination (3). This report updates a previous report (4) and describes progress toward measles elimination in EUR during 2009-2018. During 2009-2017, estimated regional coverage with the first MCV dose (MCV1) was 93%-95%, and coverage with the second dose (MCV2) increased from 73% to 90%. In 2017, 30 (57%) countries achieved ≥95% MCV1 coverage, and 15 (28%) achieved ≥95% coverage with both doses. During 2009-2018, >16 million persons were vaccinated during SIAs in 13 (24%) countries. Measles incidence declined to 5.8 per 1 million population in 2016, but increased to 89.5 in 2018, because of large outbreaks in several EUR countries. To achieve measles elimination in EUR, measures are needed to strengthen immunization programs by ensuring ≥95% 2-dose MCV coverage in every district of each country, offering supplemental measles vaccination to susceptible adults, maintaining high-quality surveillance for rapid case detection and confirmation, and ensuring effective outbreak preparedness and response."

VC, which reflects vascular aging, and malnutrition are also encountered in the non-CKD elderly population. This similarity of clinical findings suggests that the progression of CKD is related to aging and the existence of a causal relationship between VC and malnutrition. To retard renal progression, a low- or very-low-protein diet is usually recommended for CKD patients. Dietary education may induce malnutrition and deficiency of important nutrients, such as vitamins K and D. Menaquinone-7, a type of vitamin K2, is under investigation for inhibiting VC in elderly patients without CKD, as well as for prevention of VC in patients with CKD. Nutritional vitamin D, such as cholecalciferol, may be considered to decrease the required dose of active vitamin D, which increases the risk of VC due to increased calcium and phosphate loads. Omega-3 fatty acids are important nutrients and their ability to inhibit VC needs to be evaluated in clinical trials. This review focuses on the ability of supplementary nutrients to prevent VC in patients with CKD, in whom dietary restriction is essential.",Neurolytic abdominal wall blocks with alcohol for intractable gastrostomy site pain in a cancer patient.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31048655,Korean journal of anesthesiology,2019 05 03,"There have been reports of neurolytic transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block using different agents such as alcohol or phenol for the treatment of chronic abdominal pain caused by malignant abdominal wall invasion.

This hemangioma-like soft mass showed biphasic characteristics such as a slow, gradual, and benign increase in size but worrisome dural invasion with cranial bone defect. We removed the scalp mass with clear resection margins. Interoperatively, we found that the cranial bone defect had already filled. Histopathologic examination showed CMN with focal atypical PN. The nodule showed sharp demarcation and cellular pleomorphism. However, in immunohistochemical study, Ki-67 proliferation index and expression levels of protein S-100 and Melan-A were very low. These were unusual findings of atypical PNs. Despite her worrisome preoperative radiologic features, she showed an indolent clinical course compatible with previously reported biologic behavior.

Accordingly, interdisciplinary cooperation is necessary for a successful treatment. Three basic surgical problems are arising due to an EDS: decreased the strength of the tissue causes making the wound dehiscence, increased bleeding tendency due to the blood vessel fragility, and delayed wound healing period. Surgery patients with an EDS require an experienced surgeon in treating EDS patients; the treatment process requires careful tissue handling and a long postoperative care. A surgeon should also recognize whether the patient shows a resistance to local anesthetics and a high risk of hematoma formation.

The ideal surgical solution should concurrently provide vocal fold augmentation and re-establishment of tissue elasticity. Nanofat technique has given so far promising results in remodeling skin scars and improving tissue pliability. The present paper describes for the first time the use of nanofat injected into the vocal fold cover for pliability restoration, combined with traditional microfat for vocal fold augmentation. Seven patients (aged 23-77 years) affected by severe dysphonia, related to extensive vocal fold scarring (3 of them were also affected by dysphagia for liquid consistencies), underwent a single procedure of concurrent microfat and nanofat vocal fold injection under direct microlaryngoscopy in general anesthesia. Results were evaluated by objective outcome measures and auto evaluation performed by questionnaires concerning the phonatory and swallowing efficiency. The voice quality and the perceived swallowing capability of all patients improved after surgery and are stable at follow-up (4-8 months). The reported preliminary data show that nanofat, due to its regenerative potential related to adipose-derived stem cells and growth factors, can be a promising adjunct to traditional fat augmentation to improve elasticity of the delicate multilayered structure of the vocal fold and to enhance its vibratory capabilities.

In addition, mRNA from genes associated with BBB disruption vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2) as well as inflammatory cytokines and chemokines was assessed with qPCR. Piglets that developed seizures following HI (HI-Sz) had significantly greater injury, as demonstrated by poorer aEEG background pattern scores, lower neurobehavioural scores, and greater histopathology. HI-Sz animals had severe IgG extravasation into brain tissue and uptake into neurons as well as significantly greater levels of IgG in both brain regions as assessed by Western blot. IgG protein in both brain regions was significantly associated with seizure burden, aEEG pattern scores, and neurobehavioural scores. There was no difference in mRNA expression of the tight junctions, however a significant loss of ZO1 and OCLN protein was observed in the parietal cortex. The inflammatory genes TGFβ, IL1β, IL8, IL6, and TNFα were significantly upregulated in HI-Sz animals. MMP2 was significantly increased in animals with seizures compared with animals without seizures. Increasing our understanding of neuropathology associated with seizure is vital because of the association between seizure and poor outcomes.

While anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) agents are mostly chosen as a first-line treatment, there is an important role for steroids in the treatment algorithm for DME. A slow-release bioerodible dexamethasone implant and an extended-release nonbioerodible fluocinolone acetonide insert are both approved for the treatment of DME and provide the advantage of sustained drug delivery and reduced treatment burden. Steroids bare the complications of cataract progression and increase of intraocular pressure (IOP). However, with dexamethasone implant, IOP rise is well manageable with topical treatment in almost all cases. Dexamethasone implant has been shown to be effective in the treatment of naive DME as well as in eyes nonresponding to anti-VEGF agents. In these cases, early switching to steroids may be considered and has been shown to be beneficial. Fluocinolone acetonide is reserved for severe cases of chronic DME insufficiently responsive to other available therapies.

Genetic impairment of NF-κB signaling pathway or pharmacological inhibition of NF-κB activity has been shown to extend healthspan and lifespan in animal models, and delay or reduce many age-related symptoms. However, the aging intervention strategies based on NF-κB inhibition by the suitable small molecular compound is currently still lacking. The water-soluble dimethylaminomicheliolide (DMAMCL), can inhibit NF-κB activity and is currently undergoing clinical trials. In this study, we showed that 15 months of DMAMCL administration started in 1-year old male mice was well-tolerated and safe, and improved or had little effect on some age-associated symptoms, such as neurobehavioral phenotypes, physical performance, cardiac function, hematological parameters, immune aging phenotypes, clinical chemistry parameters, and glucose homeostasis. At the molecular level, DMAMCL administration mitigated serum levels of several age-associated inflammatory cytokines, including IL-6, IL-1α, IL-1β, TNF-α, IFN-γ, and CXCL2, and inhibited NF-κB activity in several aged tissues.

The clinical management is complex due to the high heterogeneity of these neoplasms in terms of clinical aggressiveness and response to the therapy. Indeed, a multidisciplinary approach is required to reach a personalization of the therapy, including cancer rehabilitation. In this review, we discuss the possibility to adopt a precision medicine (PM) approach in the management of NENs. To this purpose, we summarize current knowledge and future perspectives about biomarkers and preclinical in vitro and in vivo platforms, potentially useful to inform clinicians about the prognosis and for tailoring therapy in patients with NENs.

Elevated cholesterol levels are associated with a decreased progression free survival time (PFS) while statins are protective. 27-hydroxycholesterol (27HC), a primary metabolite of cholesterol has been shown to modulate the activities of the estrogen receptors (ERs) and liver x receptors (LXRs) providing a potential mechanistic link between cholesterol and ovarian cancer progression. We found that high expression of CYP27A1, the enzyme responsible for the synthesis of 27HC, was associated with decreased PFS, while high expression of CYP7B1, responsible for 27HC catabolism, was associated with increased PFS. However, 27HC decreased the cellular proliferation of various ovarian cancer cell lines in an LXR dependent manner. Intriguingly, ID8 grafts were unable to effectively establish in CYP27A1-/- mice, indicating involvement of the host environment. Tumors from mice treated with 27HC had altered myeloid cell composition, and cells from the marrow stem cell lineage were found to be responsible for the effects in CYP27A1-/- mice. While inhibition of CYP27A1 or immune checkpoint did not significantly alter tumor size, their combination did, thereby highlighting this axis as a therapeutic target.",Use of radiotherapy after pituitary surgery for non-functioning pituitary adenomas.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31048560,European journal of endocrinology,2019 05 03,"Surgery is the treatment of choice for non-functioning pituitary macroadenomas (NFPAs). In cases of postoperative remnant growth or tumor recurrence, radiotherapy (RT) can be considered. The role of RT in the postoperative management of NFPAs is still debated. The main arguments against routine use of RT are the lack of randomized controlled trials, the use of clinically irrelevant endpoints in most studies on RT, the benign character of the condition, the potential for side-effects of RT, and the option to apply RT at a later stage. However, because of its excellent efficacy in inhibiting tumor growth, reducing tumor volume, and improving any existing visual defects, and as its side effects seem to be limited compared to the benefits provided, RT keeps a place in the management of NFPAs when a tumor remnant persists, particularly if it is invasive and displays high proliferation markers, if surveillance shows a relevant increase in tumor volume, or if the tumor is close to the optic chiasm. The size of the remnant, its vicinity with the optic pathways, and the potential risk to healthy surrounding tissues need to be considered when deciding on a RT procedure.",Clinico-pathologic and dynamic prognostic factors in sporadic and familial medullary thyroid carcinoma: an Israeli multi-center study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31048559,European journal of endocrinology,2019 06 07,"Multiple clinical, pathological and biochemical variables, including the response to initial treatment, are associated with medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) prognosis.

This is in terms of what at present is considered symptoms of an anti-social personality, and bipolar affective disorder. Egill Skallagrimsson is considered one of the most famous Vikings in the Icelandic Sagas. Archaeological findings mentioned in Egill's Saga indicate disfigurement of his skull, which has led many authors to suggest that Egill suffered from skeletal dysplasia. The primary assumption in the literature is that Egill Skallagrimsson was affected by Paget's disease of bone. This consideration is additionally based on the scholar's interpretation of the Saga text. The unique storytelling style in the Saga of Egill Skallagrimsson is evident; however, the question of the story's truthfulness remains open. In this article, we investigate Egill Skallagrimsson's assumed Paget's disease of bone, based on the physical and mental symptoms disclosed in the Saga of Egill Skallagrimsson. Associated with the assumption, the author's hermeneutics of Egill's Saga in the context of modern-day knowledge of Paget's disease of bone, brings forward the probability estimate to the range of permille. In Scandinavian folklore and mythology, a tale by Saxo Grammaticus of a notorious shield-maiden named Visna, reminds of Egill, as noted by Snorri Sturluson.

In mice, cortical barrels reflect whisker input. We asked whether these cortical structures require sensory input to develop or are driven by intrinsic activity. Thalamocortical columns, connecting the thalamus to the cortex, emerge before sensory input and concur with calcium waves in the embryonic thalamus. We show that the columnar organization of the thalamocortical somatotopic map exists in the mouse embryo before sensory input, thus linking spontaneous embryonic thalamic activity to somatosensory map formation. Without thalamic calcium waves, cortical circuits become hyperexcitable, columnar and barrel organization does not emerge, and the somatosensory map lacks anatomical and functional structure. Thus, a self-organized protomap in the embryonic thalamus drives the functional assembly of murine thalamocortical sensory circuits.",Strongly correlated quantum walks with a 12-qubit superconducting processor.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31048551,"Science (New York, N.Y.)",2019 05 31,"Quantum walks are the quantum analogs of classical random walks, which allow for the simulation of large-scale quantum many-body systems and the realization of universal quantum computation without time-dependent control.

First, in one-photon quantum walks, we observed the propagation of the density and correlation of the quasiparticle excitation of the superconducting qubit and quantum entanglement between qubit pairs. Second, when implementing two-photon quantum walks by exciting two superconducting qubits, we observed the fermionization of strongly interacting photons from the measured time-dependent long-range anticorrelations, representing the antibunching of photons with attractive interactions. The demonstration of quantum walks on a quantum processor, using superconducting qubits as artificial atoms and tomographic readout, paves the way to quantum simulation of many-body phenomena and universal quantum computation."

Understanding how host protein variation drives lentivirus adaptation allowed us to expand the host range of HIV-1 to pigtail macaques. We have previously derived a viral swarm (in the blood of infected animals) that can cause AIDS in this new host. To further exploit this reagent, we generated infectious molecular clones (IMCs) from the viral swarm. We identified clones with high replicative capacity in pigtail peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in vitro and used in vivo replication to select an individual IMC, named stHIV-A19 (for simian tropic HIV-1 clone A19), which recapitulated the phenotype obtained with the viral swarm. Adaptation of HIV-1 in macaques led to the acquisition of amino acid changes in viral proteins, such as capsid (CA), that are rarely seen in HIV-1-infected humans. Using stHIV-A19, we show that these CA changes confer a partial resistance to the host cell inhibitor Mx2 from pigtail macaques, but that complete resistance is associated with a fitness defect.

In the NFκB signaling system, distinct kinases mediate inflammatory and developmental signaling via RelA and RelB, respectively. Although the substrates of the developmental, so-called noncanonical, pathway are induced by inflammatory/canonical signaling, crosstalk is limited. Through dynamical systems modeling, we identified the underlying regulatory mechanism. We found that as the substrate of the noncanonical kinase NIK, the nfkb2 gene product p100, transitions from a monomer to a multimeric complex, it may compete with and inhibit p100 processing to the active p52. Although multimeric complexes of p100 (IκBδ) are known to inhibit preexisting RelA:p50 through sequestration, here we report that p100 complexes can inhibit the enzymatic formation of RelB:p52. We show that the dose-response systems properties of this complex substrate competition motif are poorly accounted for by standard Michaelis-Menten kinetics, but require more detailed mass action formulations. In sum, although tonic inflammatory signaling is required for adequate expression of the noncanonical pathway precursors, the substrate complex competition motif identified here can prevent amplification of the active RelB:p52 dimer in elevated inflammatory conditions to ensure reliable RelB-dependent developmental signaling independent of inflammatory context.",Targeting RIPK1 for the treatment of human diseases.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31048504,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2019 06 10,"RIPK1 kinase has emerged as a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of a wide range of human neurodegenerative, autoimmune, and inflammatory diseases.

Furthermore, human genetic evidence has linked the dysregulation of RIPK1 to the pathogenesis of ALS as well as other inflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases. Importantly, unique allosteric small-molecule inhibitors of RIPK1 that offer high selectivity have been developed. These molecules can penetrate the blood-brain barrier, thus offering the possibility to target neuroinflammation and cell death which drive various neurologic conditions including Alzheimer's disease, ALS, and multiple sclerosis as well as acute neurological diseases such as stroke and traumatic brain injuries. We discuss the current understanding of RIPK1 regulatory mechanisms and emerging evidence for the pathological roles of RIPK1 in human diseases, especially in the context of the central nervous systems."

Normally, unphosphorylated eIF2 transfers the methionylated initiator tRNA to the ribosome in a guanosine 5'-triphosphate-dependent manner. By contrast, phosphorylated eIF2 inhibits its specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor, eIF2B. To elucidate how the eIF2 phosphorylation status regulates the eIF2B activity, we determined cryo-electron microscopic and crystallographic structures of eIF2B in complex with unphosphorylated or phosphorylated eIF2. The unphosphorylated and phosphorylated forms of eIF2 bind to eIF2B in completely different manners: the nucleotide exchange-active and -inactive modes, respectively. These structures explain how phosphorylated eIF2 dominantly inhibits the nucleotide exchange activity of eIF2B.",Genetic diversity of tumors with mismatch repair deficiency influences anti-PD-1 immunotherapy response.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31048490,"Science (New York, N.Y.)",2019 06 10,"Tumors with mismatch repair deficiency (MMR-d) are characterized by sequence alterations in microsatellites and can accumulate thousands of mutations. This high mutational burden renders tumors immunogenic and sensitive to programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) immune checkpoint inhibitors. Yet, despite their tumor immunogenicity, patients with MMR-deficient tumors experience highly variable responses, and roughly half are refractory to treatment. We present experimental and clinical evidence showing that the degree of microsatellite instability (MSI) and resultant mutational load, in part, underlies the variable response to PD-1 blockade immunotherapy in MMR-d human and mouse tumors. The extent of response is particularly associated with the accumulation of insertion-deletion (indel) mutational load. This study provides a rationale for the genome-wide characterization of MSI intensity and mutational load to better profile responses to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy across MMR-deficient human cancers.",Structural topology defines protective CD8+ T cell epitopes in the HIV proteome.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31048489,"Science (New York, N.Y.)",2019 05 03,"Mutationally constrained epitopes of variable pathogens represent promising targets for vaccine design but are not reliably identified by sequence conservation. In this study, we employed structure-based network analysis, which applies network theory to HIV protein structure data to quantitate the topological importance of individual amino acid residues. Mutation of residues at important network positions disproportionately impaired viral replication and occurred with high frequency in epitopes presented by protective human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I alleles. Moreover, CD8+ T cell targeting of highly networked epitopes distinguished individuals who naturally control HIV, even in the absence of protective HLA alleles. This approach thereby provides a mechanistic basis for immune control and a means to identify CD8+ T cell epitopes of topological importance for rational immunogen design, including a T cell-based HIV vaccine.",Electrical suppression of all nonradiative recombination pathways in monolayer semiconductors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31048488,"Science (New York, N.Y.)",2019 05 03,"Defects in conventional semiconductors substantially lower the photoluminescence (PL) quantum yield (QY), a key metric of optoelectronic performance that directly dictates the maximum device efficiency. Two-dimensional transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), such as monolayer MoS2, often exhibit low PL QY for as-processed samples, which has typically been attributed to a large native defect density. We show that the PL QY of as-processed MoS2 and WS2 monolayers reaches near-unity when they are made intrinsic through electrostatic doping, without any chemical passivation. Surprisingly, neutral exciton recombination is entirely radiative even in the presence of a high native defect density.

We found that the pore pressure and slip history imply a fault whose strength is the product of a slip-weakening friction coefficient and the local effective normal stress. Using a coupled shear-rupture model, we derived constraints on the hydromechanical parameters of the actively deforming fault. The inferred aseismic rupture front propagates faster and to larger distances than the diffusion of pressurized pore fluid.",Multivascular networks and functional intravascular topologies within biocompatible hydrogels.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31048486,"Science (New York, N.Y.)",2019 05 03,"Solid organs transport fluids through distinct vascular networks that are biophysically and biochemically entangled, creating complex three-dimensional (3D) transport regimes that have remained difficult to produce and study.

Adaptive toxicant resistance has rapidly evolved in Gulf killifish (Fundulus grandis) that occupy polluted habitats. We show that resistance scales with pollution level and negatively correlates with inducibility of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) signaling. Loci with the strongest signatures of recent selection harbor genes regulating AHR signaling. Two of these loci introgressed recently (18 to 34 generations ago) from Atlantic killifish (F. heteroclitus). One introgressed locus contains a deletion in AHR that confers a large adaptive advantage [selection coefficient (s) = 0.8]. Given the limited migration of killifish, recent adaptive introgression was likely mediated by human-assisted transport. We suggest that interspecies connectivity may be an important source of adaptive variation during extreme environmental change.",Branch-restricted localization of phosphatase Prl-1 specifies axonal synaptogenesis domains.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31048465,"Science (New York, N.Y.)",2019 05 03,"Central nervous system (CNS) circuit development requires subcellular control of synapse formation and patterning of synapse abundance. We identified the Drosophila membrane-anchored phosphatase of regenerating liver (Prl-1) as an axon-intrinsic factor that promotes synapse formation in a spatially restricted fashion. The loss of Prl-1 in mechanosensory neurons reduced the number of CNS presynapses localized on a single axon collateral and organized as a terminal arbor. Flies lacking all Prl-1 protein had locomotor defects. The overexpression of Prl-1 induced ectopic synapses. In mechanosensory neurons, Prl-1 modulates the insulin receptor (InR) signaling pathway within a single contralateral axon compartment, thereby affecting the number of synapses. The axon branch-specific localization and function of Prl-1 depend on untranslated regions of the prl-1 messenger RNA (mRNA). Therefore, compartmentalized restriction of Prl-1 serves as a specificity factor for the subcellular control of axonal synaptogenesis.",Copper's rapid ascent in visible-light photoredox catalysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31048464,"Science (New York, N.Y.)",2019 05 03,"Visible-light photoredox catalysis offers a distinct activation mode complementary to thermal transition metal catalyzed reactions.

As a low-cost alternative, organic dyes are also frequently used but in general suffer from lower photostability. Copper-based photocatalysts are rapidly emerging, offering not only economic and ecological advantages but also otherwise inaccessible inner-sphere mechanisms, which have been successfully applied to challenging transformations.

They structurally resemble sphingolipids, and studies nearly thirty years ago discovered that the most prevalent fumonisin (FB1) potently inhibits ceramide synthases (CerS), enzymes that use fatty acyl-CoAs to N-acylate sphinganine, sphingosine and other sphingoid bases. CerS inhibition by FB1 triggers a perfect storm of perturbations in structural and signaling sphingolipids that include: reduced formation of dihydroceramides, ceramides and complex sphingolipids; elevated sphinganine, sphingosine and their 1-phosphates, novel 1-deoxy-sphingoid bases; and, alteration of additional lipid metabolites from interrelated pathways. Moreover, because the initial enzyme of sphingoid base biosynthesis remains active (sometimes with increased activity), the impact is multiplied by the continued production of damaging metabolites. Evidence from many studies, including characterization of knockout mice for specific CerS and analyses of human blood (which found that FB1 intake is associated with elevated sphinganine 1-phosphate), has consistently pointed to CerS as the proximate target of FB1. It is also apparent that the changes in multiple bioactive lipids and related biologic processes account for the ensuing spectrum of animal, and plant, disease.

CoQ also functions as a membrane-localized antioxidant protecting cells against lipid peroxidation. CoQ deficiency is associated with multiple human diseases; CoQ10 supplementation in particular has noted cardioprotective benefits. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Coq10, a putative START domain protein, is believed to chaperone CoQ to sites where it functions. Yeast coq10 deletion mutants (coq10Δ) synthesize CoQ inefficiently during log phase growth, are respiratory defective and sensitive to oxidative stress. Humans have two orthologs of yeast COQ10, COQ10A and COQ10B. Here, we tested the human co-orthologs for their ability to rescue the yeast mutant. We showed that expression of either human ortholog, COQ10A or COQ10B, rescues yeast coq10Δ mutant phenotypes, restoring the function of respiratory-dependent growth on a non-fermentable carbon source and sensitivity to oxidative stress induced by treatment with polyunsaturated fatty acids. These effects indicate a strong functional conservation of Coq10 across different organisms. However, neither COQ10A nor COQ10B restored CoQ biosynthesis when expressed in the yeast coq10Δ mutant. The involvement of yeast Coq10 in CoQ biosynthesis may rely on its interactions with another protein, possibly Coq11, which is not found in humans. Co-expression analyses of yeast COQ10, and human COQ10A and COQ10B provide additional insights to functions of these START domain proteins, and their potential roles in other biologic pathways.",Accumulation of saturated intramyocellular lipid is associated with insulin resistance.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31048405,Journal of lipid research,2019 05 03,"Intramyocellular lipid (IMCL) accumulation has been linked to both insulin-resistant and to insulin-sensitive (athletes) states. Biochemical analysis of intramuscular triglyceride composition is confounded by extramyocellular triglyceride in biopsy samples, and hence the composition of specifically IMCL is unknown in these states. 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy can overcome this, and we used a recently validated method to compare the compositional saturation index (CH2:CH3 ratio) and concentration independent of composition (CH3) of IMCL in the soleus and tibialis anterior muscles of 16 female insulin-resistant lipodystrophic subjects with that of age- and gender-matched athletes (n=14) and healthy controls (n=41). The IMCL CH2:CH3 ratio was significantly higher in both muscles of the lipodystrophic subjects compared with controls, but was similar in athletes and controls. IMCL CH2:CH3 was dependent on IMCL concentration in the controls, and after adjusting the composition index for quantity (CH2:CH3adj) was able to distinguish lipodystrophics from athletes. This CH2:CH3adj marker had a stronger relationship with insulin resistance than IMCL concentration alone, and was inversely related to VO2max The association of insulin resistance with accumulation of saturated IMCL is consistent with (a) a potential pathogenic role for saturated fat, and (b) the reported benefits of exercise and diet in insulin resistant states.",Lack of monoacylglycerol lipase prevents hepatic steatosis by favoring lipid storage in adipose tissue and intestinal malabsorption.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31048404,Journal of lipid research,2019 05 03,"Monoacylglycerol lipase (MGL) is the rate-limiting enzyme in the degradation of monoacylglycerols.

Lipid metabolism, inflammation and fibrosis were assessed by serum biochemistry, histology and gene expression profiling of liver and adipose depots. Intestinal fat absorption was measured by gas chromatography. Primary adipocyte and 3T3-L1 were analyzed by flow cytometry and western blot. Human hepatocytes were treated with MGL inhibitor JZL184. Absence of MGL protected mice from hepatic steatosis repressing key lipogenic enzymes in liver (Srebp1c, Pparγ2, Dgat1), while promoting FA oxidation. Liver inflammation was diminished in MGL-/- fed WD, as evidenced by diminished F4/80 staining and Ccl2 gene expression, while fibrosis remained unchanged. Absence of MGL promoted fat storage in gonadal white adipose tissue (gWAT) with increased lipogenesis and unchanged lipolysis, diminished inflammation in gWAT and subcutaneous AT. Intestinal fat malabsorption prevented ectopic lipid accumulation in livers of MGL-/- fed WD. In vitro experiments demonstrated increased adipocyte size/lipid content driven by PPARγ. In conclusion our data uncover that MGL deletion improves some aspects of NAFLD by promoting lipid storage in gWAT and fat malabsorption.","ESMO-ESGO consensus conference recommendations on ovarian cancer: pathology and molecular biology, early and advanced stages, borderline tumours and recurrent disease.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31048403,International journal of gynecological cancer : official journal of the International Gynecological Cancer Society,2019 05 03,"The development of guidelines is one of the core activities of the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) and European Society of Gynaecologial Oncology (ESGO), as part of the mission of both societies to improve the quality of care for patients with cancer across Europe.

Comparisons across species show that, in spite of changes in the underlying regulatory DNA sequence, developmental programs can be maintained across millions of years of evolution. Reciprocally, changes in gene expression can be used to generate morphological novelty. Distinguishing between changes in regulatory DNA that lead to changes in gene expression and those that do not is therefore a central goal of evolutionary developmental biology. Quantitative, spatially-resolved measurements of developmental gene expression patterns play a crucial role in this goal, enabling the detection of subtle phenotypic differences between species and the development of computations models that link the sequence of regulatory DNA to expression patterns. Here we report the generation of two atlases of cellular resolution gene expression measurements for the primary anterior-posterior patterning genes in Drosophila simulans and Drosophila virilis By combining these data sets with existing atlases for three other Drosophila species, we detect subtle differences in the gene expression patterns and dynamics driving the highly conserved axis patterning system and delineate inter-species differences in the embryonic morphology.

Here we characterize behavioral reaction norms as thermal performance curves for the nematode Caenorhabditis briggsae, using a collection of 23 wild isolate genotypes and 153 recombinant inbred lines to quantify the extent of genetic and plastic variation in locomotory behavior to temperature changes. By reducing the dimensionality of the multivariate phenotypic response with a function-valued trait framework, we identified genetically distinct behavioral modules that contribute to the heritable variation in the emergent overall behavioral thermal performance curve. Quantitative trait locus mapping isolated regions on Chromosome II associated with locomotory activity at benign temperatures and Chromosome V loci related to distinct aspects of sensitivity to high temperatures, with each quantitative trait locus explaining up to 28% of trait variation. These findings highlight how behavioral responses to environmental inputs as thermal reaction norms can evolve through independent changes to genetically distinct modular components of such complex phenotypes.",Draft Genome Sequences of Three Monokaryotic Isolates of the White-Rot Basidiomycete Fungus Dichomitus squalens.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31048399,Microbiology resource announcements,2019 05 14,"Here, we report the draft genome sequences of three isolates of the wood-decaying white-rot basidiomycete fungus Dichomitus squalens The genomes of these monokaryons were sequenced to provide more information on the intraspecies genomic diversity of this fungus and were compared to the previously sequenced genome of D. squalens LYAD-421 SS1.",Draft Whole-Genome Sequences of Three Isolates of a Novel Strain of a Campylobacter sp.

Recent work has investigated how disrupting αSyn's interaction with membranes triggers trafficking defects, cellular stress, and apoptosis. Special interest has been devoted to a series of mutants exacerbating the effects of the E46K mutation (associated with autosomal dominant PD) through homologous E-to-K substitutions in αSyn's N-terminal region (i.e. E35K, E61K). Such E46K-like mutants have been shown to cause dopaminergic neuron loss and severe, yet L-DOPA-responsive, motor defects in mouse overexpression models, presenting enormous translational potential for PD and other ""synucleinopathies"". In this work, using a variety of biophysical techniques, we characterize the molecular pathology of E46K-like αSyn mutants by studying their structure and membrane-binding and remodeling abilities. We find that, although a slight increase in the mutants' avidity for synaptic vesicle-like membranes can be detected, most of their deleterious effects are connected to their complete disruption of αSyn's curvature selectivity. Indiscriminate binding can shift αSyn's subcellular localization away from its physiological interactants at the synaptic bouton toward trafficking vesicles and organelles, as observed in E46K-like cellular and murine models, as well as in human pathology. In conclusion, our findings suggest that a loss of curvature selectivity, rather than increased membrane affinity, could be the critical dyshomeostasis in synucleinopathies.",Mechanism of cognate sequence discrimination by the ETS-family transcription factor ETS-1.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31048376,The Journal of biological chemistry,2019 05 03,"Functional evidence increasingly implicates low-affinity DNA recognition by transcription factors as a general mechanism for the spatiotemporal control of developmental genes. Although the DNA sequence requirements for affinity are well defined, the dynamic mechanisms that execute cognate recognition are much less resolved. To address this gap, here we examined ETS1, a paradigm developmental transcription factor, as a model for which cognate discrimination remains enigmatic. Using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we interrogated the DNA-binding domain of murine ETS1, alone and when bound to high-and low-affinity cognate sites or to nonspecific DNA. The results of our analyses revealed collective backbone and sidechain motions that distinguished cognate versus nonspecific, as well as high- versus low-affinity cognate DNA binding. Combined with binding experiments with site-directed ETS1 mutants, the MD data disclosed a triad of residues that respond specifically to low-affinity cognate DNA. We found that a DNA-contacting residue (Gln-336) specifically recognizes low-affinity DNA and triggers the loss of at distal salt bridge (Glu-343/Arg-378), via a large sidechain motion, which compromises the hydrophobic packing of two core helices. As an intact Glu-343/Arg-378 bridge is the default state in unbound ETS1 and maintained in high-affinity and nonspecific complexes, the low-affinity complex represents a unique conformational adaptation to the sub-optimization of developmental enhancers."

It is of vital importance to develop new strategies for PCa therapy. PSMA (Prostate specific membrane antigen) is specifically expressed in PCa and the neo-vasculature of certain cancer types, thus is considered to be an ideal target for cancer therapy. In our previous study, we have obtained an PSMA specific single chain variable fragment (scFv), named gy1, from a large yeast-display naive human scFv library. In this study, we reconstructed the PSMA scFv into a fully human antibody (named PSMAb) and evaluated its characterization both in vitro and in vivo. We showed that PSMAb can specifically bind with and internalize into PSMA+ cells. The binding affinity of PSMAb is measured to be at nanomolar level, and PSMAb has very good thermostability. In vivo study showed that near infrared dye labeled PSMAb can specifically localize at PSMA+ tumors, and the application of PSMAb in vivo significantly inhibited the growth of PSMA+ tumors, but not PSMA- tumors. At the studied doses, no obvious toxicity was observed when applied in vivo, as shown by the relative liver and kidney function and normal structure of important organs, shown by HE staining. In addition, PSMAb may inhibit tumor growth through ADCC and CDC mechanisms. Our results indicated that the novel fully human antibody PSMAb deserve further study for PSMA targeted diagnosis and therapy for PCa and other cancer types with vascular PSMA expression.",The myeloid differentiation factor 88 signaling in donor T cells accelerates graft-versus-host disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31048358,Haematologica,2019 05 03,"The myeloid differentiation factor 88 signaling has a crucial role in activation of both innate and adoptive immunity. Myeloid differentiation factor 88 transduces signal via Toll-like receptor and interleukin-1 receptor superfamily to NFkB pathway and inflammasome by forming a molecular complex with interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 4. Myeloid differentiation factor 88/interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 4 pathway plays an important role not only in innate immunity but also T-cell immunity; however, its role in donor T cells on graft-versus-host disease pathophysiology remains to be elucidated. We addressed this issue by using myeloid differentiation factor 88-deficient T cells in a mouse model of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. While myeloid differentiation factor 88-deficient and wild-type T cells proliferated equivalently after transplantation, myeloid differentiation factor 88-deficient T cells demonstrated impaired survival and differentiation toward Th1, Tc1, and Th17, and induced less severe graft-versus-host disease compared to wild-type T cells. Administration of interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 4 inhibitor PF-06650833 significantly ameliorated graft-versus-host disease after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. These results thus demonstrate that donor T-cell myeloid differentiation factor 88/ interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 4 pathway is a novel therapeutic target against graft-versus-host disease after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.",Multilayer intraclonal heterogeneity in chronic myelomonocytic leukemia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31048357,Haematologica,2019 05 03,"The functional diversity of cells that compose myeloid malignancies, i.e. the respective role of genetic and epigenetic heterogeneity in this diversity, remains poorly understood. This question is addressed in chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, a myeloid neoplasm in which clinical diversity contrasts with limited genetic heterogeneity. To generate induced pluripotent stem cell clones, we reprogrammed CD34-positive cells collected from a patient with a chronic myelomonocytic leukemia in which whole exome sequencing of peripheral blood monocyte DNA had identified 12 gene mutations, including a mutation in KDM6A and 2 heterozygous mutations in TET2 in the founding clone and a secondary KRASG12D mutation. CD34-positive cells from an age-matched healthy donor were also reprogrammed. We captured a part of the genetic heterogeneity observed in the patient, i.e. we analyzed five clones with two genetic backgrounds, without and with KRASG12D mutation. Hematopoietic differentiation of these clones recapitulated the main features of the patient disease, including overproduction of granulomonocytes and dysmegakaryopoiesis. These analyses also disclosed significant discrepancies in the behavior of hematopoietic cells derived from induced pluripotent stem cell clones with similar genetic background, correlating with limited epigenetic changes. These analyses suggest that, beyond the coding mutations, several levels of intraclonal heterogeneity may participate to the yet unexplained clinical heterogeneity of the disease.",Ibrutinib reduces obinutuzumab infusion related reactions in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and is associated with changes in plasma cytokine levels.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31048356,Haematologica,2019 05 03,,Allogeneic stem cell transplantation using HLA-matched donors for acute myeloid leukemia with deletion 5q or monosomy 5: a study from the Acute Leukemia Working Party of the EBMT.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31048355,Haematologica,2019 05 03,"Deletion 5q or monosomy 5 (-5/5q-) in acute myeloid leukemia is a common high-risk feature referred to allogeneic stem cell transplantation. However, -5/5q- is frequently associated with other high-risk cytogenetic aberrations such as complex karyotype, monosomal karyotype, monosomy 7 (-7), or 17p abnormalities (abn (17p)), the significance of which is unknown. In order to address this question, we studied adult patients with acute myeloid leukemia harboring -5/5q- having their first allogeneic transplantation between 2000 and 2015. Five hundred and one patients with -5/5q- have been analyzed. Three hundred thirty-eight patients (67%) were in first remission and 142 (28%) had an active disease at time of allogeneic transplantation. The 2-year probabilities of overall survival and leukemia-free survival were 27% and 20%, respectively. The 2-year probability of treatment-related mortality was 20%. We identified 4 different cytogenetic groups according to additional abnormalities with prognostic impact: -5/5q- without complex karyotype, monosomal karyotype or abn(17p), -5/5q- within a complex karyotype, -5/5q- within a monosomal karyotype and the combination of -5/5q- with abn(17p). In multivariate analysis, factors associated with worse overall survival and leukemia-free survival across the 4 groups were active disease, age, monosomal karyotype and abn(17p). The presence of -5/5q- without monosomal karyotype or abn(17p) was associated with a significantly better survival rate while -5/5q- in conjunction with monosomal karyotype or abn(17p) translated into a worse outcome. The patients harboring the combination of -5/5q- with abn(17p) showed very limited benefit from allogeneic transplantation.",Neutrophils and neutrophil extracellular traps enhance venous thrombosis in mice bearing human pancreatic tumors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31048354,Haematologica,2019 05 08,"Pancreatic cancer is associated with high incidence of venous thromboembolism. Neutrophils have been shown to contribute to thrombosis in part by releasing neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). A recent study showed that increased plasma levels of the NET biomarker, citrullinated histone H3 (H3Cit), are associated with venous thromboembolism in pancreatic and lung cancer but not in other types of cancer, including breast cancer. In this study, we examined the contribution of neutrophils and NETs to venous thrombosis in nude mice bearing human pancreatic tumors. We found that tumor-bearing mice had increased circulating neutrophil counts and levels of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, neutrophil elastase, H3Cit and cell-free DNA compared with controls. In addition, thrombi from tumor-bearing mice contained increased levels of the neutrophil marker Ly6G, as well as higher levels of H3Cit and cell-free DNA. Thrombi from tumor-bearing mice also had denser fibrin with thinner fibers consistent with increased thrombin generation. Importantly, either neutrophil depletion or administration of DNase I reduced the thrombus size in tumor-bearing but not in control mice. Our results, together with clinical data, suggest that neutrophils and NETs contribute to venous thrombosis in pancreatic cancer patients.","Proposed diagnostic criteria for classical CMML, CMML variants and pre-CMML conditions.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31048353,Haematologica,2019 05 03,"Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) is a myeloid neoplasm characterized by dysplasia, abnormal production and accumulation of monocytic cells and an elevated risk to transform into acute leukemia. Over the past two decades, our knowledge about the pathogenesis and molecular mechanisms in CMML has increased substantially. In parallel, better diagnostic criteria and therapeutic strategies have been developed. However, many questions remain regarding prognostication and optimal therapy. In addition, there is a need to define potential pre-phases of CMML and special CMML variants, and to separate these entities from each other and from conditions mimicking CMML. To address these unmet needs, an international consensus group met in a Working Conference in August 2018 and discussed open questions and issues around CMML, its variants, and pre-CMML conditions. The outcomes of this meeting are summarized herein and include diagnostic criteria and a proposed classification of pre-CMML conditions as well as refined minimal diagnostic criteria for classical CMML and special CMML variants, including oligomonocytic CMML and CMML associated with systemic mastocytosis. Moreover, we propose diagnostic standards and tools to delineate between normal, pre-CMML and CMML entities. These criteria and standards should facilitate diagnostic and prognostic evaluations in daily practice and clinical studies in applied hematology.",Structural analysis of ischemic stroke thrombi: histological indications for therapy resistance.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31048352,Haematologica,2019 05 14,"Ischemic stroke is caused by a thromboembolic occlusion of cerebral arteries. Treatment is focused on fast and efficient removal of the occluding thrombus, either via intravenous thrombolysis or via endovascular thrombectomy. Recanalization, however, is not always successful and factors contributing to failure are not completely understood. Although the occluding thrombus is the primary target of acute treatment, little is known about its internal organization and composition. The aim of this study, therefore, was to better understand the internal organization of ischemic stroke thrombi on a molecular and cellular level. A total of 188 thrombi were collected from endovascularly treated ischemic stroke patients and analyzed histologically for fibrin, red blood cells, von Willebrand factor , platelets, leukocytes and DNA, using bright field and fluorescence microscopy. Our results show that stroke thrombi are composed of two main types of areas: red blood cell-rich areas and platelet-rich areas. Red blood cell-rich areas have limited complexity as they consist of red blood cells that are entangled in a meshwork of thin fibrin. In contrast, platelet-rich areas are characterized by dense fibrin structures aligned with von Willebrand factor and abundant amounts of leukocytes and DNA that accumulate around and in these platelet-rich areas. These findings are important to better understand why platelet-rich thrombi are resistant to thrombolysis and difficult to retrieve via thrombectomy and can guide further improvements of acute ischemic stroke therapy.",Asthma progression and mortality: The role of inhaled corticosteroids.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31048346,The European respiratory journal,2019 05 03,"Overall, asthma mortality rates have declined dramatically in the last 30 years, due to improved diagnosis and to better treatment, particularly in the 1990s following the more widespread use of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). The impact of ICS on other long-term outcomes, such as lung function decline, is less certain, in part because the factors associated with these outcomes are incompletely understood. The purpose of this review is to evaluate the effect of pharmacological interventions, particularly ICS, on asthma progression and mortality. Furthermore, the potential mechanisms of action of pharmacotherapy on asthma progression and mortality, the effects of ICS on long-term changes in lung function, and the role of ICS in various asthma phenotypes is reviewed.Overall, there is compelling evidence of the value of ICS in improving asthma control, as measured by improved symptoms, pulmonary function and reduced exacerbations. There is, however, less convincing evidence that ICS prevent the decline in pulmonary function that occurs in some, although not all, patients with asthma. Severe exacerbations are associated with a more rapid decline in pulmonary function, and by reducing the risk of severe exacerbations, it is likely that ICS will, at least partially, prevent this decline. Studies using administrative databases also support an important role for ICS in reducing asthma mortality, but the fact that asthma mortality is, fortunately, an uncommon event, make it highly improbable that this will be demonstrated in prospective trials.","Detection, survival and infectious potential of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in the environment: A review of the evidence and epidemiological implications.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31048345,The European respiratory journal,2019 05 03,"Much remains unknown about Mycobacterium tuberculosis transmission. Seminal experimental studies from the 1950s demonstrated that airborne expulsion of droplet nuclei from an infectious tuberculosis patient is the primary route of transmission. However, these findings did not rule out other routes of M. tuberculosis transmission. We reviewed historical scientific evidence from the late 19th and early 20th century and contemporary studies investigating the presence, persistence, and infectiousness of environmental M. tuberculosis We found evidence - both experimental and epidemiological - supporting the presence and viability of M. tuberculosis in multiple natural and built environments for months to years, presumably following contamination by a human source. Further, several studies confirm M. tuberculosis viability and virulence in the environment using guinea pig and mouse models. Most of this evidence was historical; however, several recent studies have reported consistent findings of M. tuberculosis detection and viability in the environment using modern methods. Whether or not M. tuberculosis in environments represents an infectious threat to humans, it may represent an untapped source of data with which to further understand M. tuberculosis transmission. We discuss potential opportunities for harnessing these data to generate new insights into tuberculosis transmission in congregate settings."

We validated TP53, BAX, and PMAIP1 as genes whose inactivation results in venetoclax resistance in AML cell lines. Resistance to venetoclax resulted from an inability to execute apoptosis driven by BAX loss, decreased expression of BCL2, and/or reliance on alternative BCL2 family members such as BCL2L1. The resistance was accompanied by changes in mitochondrial homeostasis and cellular metabolism. Evaluation of TP53 and BAX knockout cells for sensitivities to a panel of small molecule inhibitors revealed a gain of sensitivity to TRK inhibitors. We relate these observations to patient drug responses and gene expression in the Beat AML dataset.

It relies on the interaction of the axons and the oligodendrocytes: the glial cells producing CNS myelin. Here, we have investigated the role of a crucial component of the Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signalling pathway, the co-receptor Boc, in developmental and repairing myelination. During development, Boc mutant mice display a transient decrease in oligodendroglial cell density together with delayed myelination. Despite recovery of oligodendroglial cells at later stages, adult mutants still exhibit a lower production of myelin basic protein correlated with a significant decrease in the calibre of callosal axons and a reduced amount of the neurofilament NF-M. During myelin repair, the altered OPC differentiation observed in the mutant is reminiscent of the phenotype observed after blockade of Shh signalling. In addition, Boc mutant microglia/macrophages unexpectedly exhibit the apparent inability to transition from a highly to a faintly ramified morphology in vivo Altogether, these results identify Boc as an important component of myelin formation and repair.",The origins and non-canonical functions of macrophages in development and regeneration.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31048317,"Development (Cambridge, England)",2019 05 03,"The discovery of new non-canonical (i.e. non-innate immune) functions of macrophages has been a recurring theme over the past 20 years.

In addition, macrophages play crucial roles in diseases such as obesity-associated diabetes or cancers. Increased knowledge of their regulatory roles within each tissue will therefore help us to better understand the full extent of their functions and could highlight new mechanisms modulating disease pathogenesis.

Homology between an H1N1 hemagglutinin and two hypocretin sequences has been reported. T cell reactivity to these peptides was assessed in 81 narcolepsy type 1 patients and 19 HLA-DQ6-matched healthy controls. HLA-DQ6-restricted H1N1 hemagglutinin-specific T cell responses were detected in 28.4% of patients and 15.8% of controls. Despite structural homology between HLA-DQ6-hypocretin and -H1N1 peptide complexes, T cell cross-reactivity was not detected. These results indicate that it is unlikely that cross-reactivity between H1N1 hemagglutinin and hypocretin peptides presented by HLA-DQ6 is involved in the development of narcolepsy.",Effect of donepezil on the expression and responsiveness to LPS of CHRNA7 and CHRFAM7A in macrophages: A possible link to the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31048268,Journal of neuroimmunology,2019 05 25,"The α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (CHRNA7) modulates the inflammatory response by activating the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway. CHRFAM7A, the human-restricted duplicated form of CHRNA7, has a negative effect on the functioning of α7 receptors, suggesting that CHRFAM7A expression regulation may be a key step in the modulation of inflammation in the human setting. The analysis of the CHRFAM7A gene's regulatory region reveals some of the mechanisms driving its expression and responsiveness to LPS in human immune cell models. Moreover, given the immunomodulatory potential of donepezil we show that it differently modulates CHRFAM7A and CHRNA7 responsiveness to LPS, thus contributing to its therapeutic potential.",Proteomic analysis of the fast-twitch muscle of pacu (Piaractus mesopotamicus) after prolonged fasting and compensatory growth.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31048267,"Comparative biochemistry and physiology. Part D, Genomics & proteomics",2019 05 18,"Protocols that improve growth performance in fish while assuring product quality are important for aquaculture. Fasting followed by refeeding may promote compensatory growth, thus optimizing growth performance. During fasting and refeeding, fast-twitch muscle, which comprises most of fish fillet, undergoes intense plasticity. In this work, we studied the proteome of pacu (Piaractus mesopotamicus) fast-twitch muscle after 30 days of fasting (D30), 30 days of refeeding (D60) and 60 days of refeeding (D90) with two-dimensional electrophoresis, mass spectrometry and bioinformatics. Body mass, growth rate and muscle histology were also assessed. At D30, fish presented muscle catabolism and decreased growth. Proteomic analysis showed that metabolism proteins were the most affected, up and downregulated. Cytoskeleton and amino acid biosynthesis proteins were downregulated, while nuclear and regulatory proteins were upregulated. At D60, fish showed accelerated growth, despite the body mass not completely recovering. Metabolism proteins were still the most affected. Amino acid biosynthesis proteins became upregulated, while cytoskeleton proteins remained downregulated. At D90, the fish presented total compensatory growth. Many metabolic proteins were up or downregulated. Few cytoskeleton proteins remained differentially expressed. Amino acid biosynthesis proteins were mostly upregulated, but less than at D60. Prolonged fasting followed by refeeding also led to the regulation of possible meat quality biomarkers, such as antioxidant enzymes. This fact suggests possible consequences of this protocol on fish meat quality. Our work also enriches our knowledge on proteomic changes during muscle plasticity that occur during fasting and refeeding diet protocols.",Feather evolution from knotted barbules to hooked and unhooked barbules and its finite element analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31048266,"Micron (Oxford, England : 1993)",2019 05 26,"Experiments involving scanning electron microscopy of the microstructure of barbules and optical microscopy of knotted barbules were conducted: the behaviour of knotted barbules, and their evolution to form a branch of hooked barbules and unhooked barbules were analysed.

In order to understand the corresponding mechanisms, different homogenization pressures were applied on sewage sludge, and solid and liquid fractions were separately digested to clarify contribution of solid and liquid fractions to biogas production. Results showed that the methane was mainly produced from solid fraction, and methane yield was increased with the increase of pretreatment pressure. The biogas and methane production from sludge (digested without solid-liquid separation) was 17% and 45% higher than the sum of that from solid and liquid fractions (digested separately) under a pressure of 40 MPa, respectively. This indicated that the sludge liquid fraction synergistically improved the biodegradation of sludge solids. The improvement of anaerobic digestion was attributed to organic release by sludge disintegration, sludge disruption and further increase of particle surface area. The methane production was linear with effectiveness of HPH pretreatment.",Comparative analysis of rhamnolipid congener synthesis in neotype Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 10145 and two marine isolates.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31048264,Bioresource technology,2019 05 21,"A comparative study of rhamnolipid congener synthesis was performed using the neotype Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 10145 and two marine isolates (1A01151 and 1A00364). Compared with the neotype, 1A01151 and 1A00364 showed increased production of rhamnolipids containing higher proportion of congeners with longer fatty acid chains (C10-C12 and C10-C12:1) and/or di-rhamnose moiety. These could reduce surface tension of water to lower minimum values of 21.3 mN m-1 and 25.7 mN m-1. The comparative profile of rhamnolipid congener composition, fatty acid content and gene expression suggested that elevated expression of rhlAB and rhlC throughout the fermentation process and enhanced accumulation of dTDP-l-rhamnose and fatty acid precursors (C12 and C12:1) at the onset of rhamnolipid accumulation were related to improved rhamnolipid production and surface-active property. This work provides insights into the metabolic relationship between rhamnolipids and related precursor biosynthesis, and could therefore be beneficial for process optimization for efficient rhamnolipid congener production.",Self-rotary propellers with clockwise/counterclockwise blades create spiral flow fields to improve mass transfer and promote microalgae growth.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31048263,Bioresource technology,2019 05 21,"In this work, self-rotary propellers (SRPs) with clockwise/counterclockwise blades were investigated to create spiral flow fields without external power to strengthen gas-liquid mixing and promote microalgal growth in an open raceway pond. The rotational flow around the propellers and spiral flow between the propellers generated extensive wall shear stress in three dimensions. Four-clockwise blades on the propellers exerted better mixing than three-counterclockwise blades. The bubble generation diameter was reduced by 69% and the mass transfer coefficient increased by 49% when the propeller diameter was increased from 32 to 60 mm. The photochemical efficiency (φPSII) of Arthrospira platensis cells was enhanced by 25%, while the helix pitch and trichome lengths were enlarged by 7-16%.

Higher than 200 °C, the dielectric constants (εr'), dielectric loss factors (εr″) and loss tangent coefficients (tan δ) of mixture at a ore/biomass mixing ratio of 10:1.2 were observed to suddenly drop to low levels, with 5.107 (F/M), 8.5 × 10-4 (F/M), 1.66 × 10-4 (F/M), respectively; which were attributed to the MnO2 reduced by the reductive volatiles produced by biomass pyrolysis. Meanwhile, the volatiles rendered a decrease in density and dielectric properties of the mixture. The work highlights the possibility of reducing manganese ore by walnut shell with microwave heating."

Part A, Molecular and biomolecular spectroscopy",2019 05 24,"The meter-scale variations of material properties of the 20-m sized Chelyabinsk meteoroid are critical for understanding why the meteoroid fragmented the way it did and caused the devastating airburst that sent over 1600 people to the hospital for treatment of glass cuts and minor injuries on February 15, 2013. From a range of differently looking unweathered meteorite fragments that were recovered shortly after the event, these material differences were probed by means of optical and scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and the high velocity resolution Mössbauer spectroscopy. All main and some minor iron-bearing phases were identified on the basis of XRD data and Mössbauer spectra. The Fe2+ partitioning between the M1 and M2 sites in silicate phases was determined independently using XRD and Mössbauer data. Different meteorite fragments show a range of 570-1180 K in the temperature of the Fe2+ and Mg2+ equilibrium distribution between the M1 and M2 sites in olivine, while that in orthopyroxene falls in the range 870-1180 K (these ranges were estimated using both techniques). This fact points out a slightly different thermal history of these minerals before they accumulated in different parts of the Chelyabinsk meteoroid. The Chelyabinsk meteoroid is a fragmental breccia from materials formed at different depths in their parent body, or from materials that experienced different annealing temperatures in impacts. In addition, the fusion crust from two fragments, studied by XRD and Mössbauer spectroscopy, experienced a different thermal history during entry, suggesting that the fragment with mixed light and dark lithologies was located deeper inside the initial meteoroid than the fragment with only light lithology, or fragmented less readily.",A simple turn-on ESIPT and PET-based fluorescent probe for detection of Al3+ in real-water sample.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31048249,"Spectrochimica acta.

In this review, we discuss key developmental transitions and social roles associated with young adult substance use, including changes in educational status, employment, intimate partner relationships, friendships, and living status. We include important differences in substance use among groups defined by race, ethnicity, and sexual orientation.

However, BMI has also been negatively associated with body image. Our goal was to evaluate whether IE is uniquely associated with body image, independent of objective weight status (measured BMI). Further, as a secondary aim, this study analyzed potential moderators (BMI, sex, race-ethnicity) in the IE-body image relationship. Data from 136 adults (34 ± 15 years old, 74% female, 56% Caucasian) were analyzed. BMI was objectively measured in-lab. IE was measured with the Intuitive Eating Scale-2. Body image was measured as a Body Concern composite created using the Eating Disorder Examination-Questionnaire (EDE-Q 6.0) Weight and Shape Concern subscales. Demographic factors and covariates were measured via self-report. Regressions revealed that, after controlling for BMI and covariates, Total IE was uniquely associated with Body Concern (β = -0.463, p < .001), as were two of the IE subscales: Unconditional Permission to Eat (Unconditional Permission; β = -0.320, p < .001) and Eating for Physical Rather than Emotional Reasons (Physical Reasons; β = -0.408, p < .001). BMI was also found to be a significant moderator between IE and Body Concern for Total IE (b = 0.071, p = .017), Unconditional Permission (b = 0.067, p = .001), and Physical Reasons (b = 0.038, p = .021), with the negative association between IE and Body Concern being strongest for healthy weight individuals. Greater IE was associated with lower body image concern across the weight spectrum, though this relationship was strongest for healthy weight individuals and attenuated as BMI increased.","5,2'-Dibromo-2,4,5-trihydroxydiphenylmethanone, a novel immunomodulator of T lymphocytes by regulating the CD4+ T cell subset balance via activating the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31048246,International immunopharmacology,2019 05 28,"5,2'-Dibromo-2,4',5'-trihydroxydiphenylmethanone (LM49) exerted therapeutic effects against rat acute pyelonephritis by regulating immune responses, especially affecting T lymphocytes. However, its underlying action mechanism remains unclear. T lymphocytes play an irreplaceable role in immune responses. Therefore, we sought to understand whether LM49 is an immunomodulator of T lymphocytes. The results showed that LM49 promoted T lymphocyte proliferation, increased the number of CD4+ T cells, and increased the CD4+/CD8+ T cell ratio. LM49 regulated the CD4+ T cell subset balance by increasing the production of CD4+IL-2+, CD4+IL-4+, and CD4+IL-10+, and reducing the production of CD4+IL-17+, without changing the production of interferon-γ. LM49 had a significant effect on the mRNA expression of the transcription factors T-bet, GATA3, Foxp3, and RORγt. Furthermore, LM49 raised the phospho (p)-extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 1/2, p-p38, and p-c-Jun N-terminal kinase expression levels. T cell proliferation, and the production of CD4+IL-2+, CD4+IL-4+, and CD4+IL-10+ induced by LM49, were decreased by inhibitors of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). These results revealed that LM49 possesses immunomodulatory activity on T lymphocytes, in which the MAPK pathway plays an essential role.",Metabolic programming of macrophage functions and pathogens control.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31048245,Redox biology,2019 06 10,"Macrophages (Mφ) are central players in mediating proinflammatory and immunomodulatory functions.

Metabolism serves as the provider of energy, substrates, and byproducts that support differential Mφ characteristics. The metabolic properties that control the polarization and response of Mφ remain to be fully uncovered for use in managing infectious diseases.

Based on a combined Molecular Mechanics / Quantum Mechanics approach, the extended and folded L- and D-configuration and radical intermediate hCT15-19 peptides were optimized to obtain their compactness, secondary structure and relative thermodynamic data. The results suggest that the epimerization of residues is generally an exergonic process that can explain the cumulative nature of molecular aging. Moreover, the configurational inversion induced conformational changes can cause protein dysfunction. The epimerization of the central residue to the D-configuration induced a hairpin structure in hCT15-19, concomitant with a possible oligomerization of human calcitonin into Aβ(1-42)-like amyloid fibrils present in patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease.",Polymeric micelles of pluronic F127 reduce hemolytic potential of amphiphilic drugs.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31048243,"Colloids and surfaces. B, Biointerfaces",2019 05 22,"One of the main toxicities associated to intravenous administration of amphiphilic drugs is pronounced hemolytic activity. To overcome this limitation, we investigated the anti-hemolytic properties of polymeric micelles of Pluronics, triblock copolymers of poly(ethylene oxide) and poly(propylene oxide). We studied the encapsulation of the amphiphilic compound miltefosine (HePC) into polymeric micelles of Pluronics F108, F68, F127, L44, and L64. In vitro hemolysis indicated that, among the five copolymers studied, only F127 completely inhibited hemolytic effect of HePC at 50 μg/mL, this effect was also observed for other two amphiphilic molecules (cetyltrimethylammonium bromide and cethylpyridinium chloride). To better understand this interaction, we analyzed the HC50 (concentration causing 50% of hemolysis) for HePC free and loaded into F127 micelles. Copolymer concentration influenced the hemolytic profile of encapsulated HePC; for F127 the HC50 increased relative to free HePC (40 μg/mL) up to 184, 441, 736 and 964 μg/mL, for 1, 3, 6 and 9% F127, respectively. Interestingly, a linear relationship was found between HC50-HePC and F127 concentration. At 3% of F127, it is possible to load up to 300 μg/mL of HePC with no hemolytic effect. By achieving this level of hemolysis protection, a promising application is on the view, bringing the parenteral use of HePC and other amphiphilic drugs. Additionally, small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) was used to asses structural information on the interactions between HePC and F127 micelles.",Selective endothelialization and alleviation of neointimal hyperplasia by functionalizing the Ti-O surface with l-selenocystine and KREDVC.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31048242,"Colloids and surfaces. B, Biointerfaces",2019 05 22,"Due to their relatively good biocompatibility and inactivity, titanium oxide films (Ti-O) are used in the coating of coronary stents, which reduces metal corrosion, slows metal ion release, and improves endothelial cell (EC) compatibility. Here, we report further functionalizing Ti-O with biological cues for selective endothelialization. Selenocystine with an l- or a d-enantiomer was first immobilized on the Ti-O film via polydopamine to generate nitric oxide (NO) endogenously, which inhibited smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation, followed by the grafting of a functional KREDVC peptide to induce EC adhesion. The synergistic effects of the immobilized KREDVC, surface chirality, and NO generation on selective endothelialization were investigated. The results showed that the surface chirality of the l-enantiomer and KREDVC grafting significantly enhanced the attachment and growth of ECs compared to SMCs. An in vivo study showed von Willebrand factor expression was increased and neointimal hyperplasia was significantly decreased in samples with l-selenocystine immobilization and KREDVC grafting. In summary, these findings provide new insights on the surface modification of cardiovascular implants with selective endothelialization."

Vigorous recirculation between the aeration and the anoxic tanks is enforced, to ensure complete denitrification. The scope of the present work was to investigate the possibility for nitrification-denitrification process in once-through systems (i.e.: without recirculation), without the need for the addition of extra carbon source (i.e. using the BOD in wastewater as carbon source), using encapsulated microorganisms. The primary aim was to increase the concentration of nitrifiers in the aerated reactor with parallel operation at hydraulic retention times (HRTs) below the doubling time of heterotrophic microorganisms, thus ensuring high ammonia oxidation rate and minimal reduction of organic carbon. The preserved organic carbon may be then used as carbon source at the downstream anoxic reactor. Coagulated and clarified wastewater from the effluent of the primary clarifier of a municipal wastewater treatment plant was used as feed to the system. The system comprised of two reactors (with 2 L working volume each) configured in series. The first one (aerated tank) contained encapsulated nitrifiers, while the second one (anoxic tank) contained encapsulated denitrifiers. The system operated at HRTs 8, 4 and 3 h (calculated individually for each reactor). The experiments indicated that at HRT equal to 8 h, almost all N-NH4+ was converted to N-NO3- in the aerated reactor, while the total nitrogen (TN) concentration was below 2 mg L-1 at the exit of the system. At HRT of 4 h a slight decrease in N-NH4+ removal was observed at the exit of the aerated tank (N-NH4+ concentration was measured 3.7 ± 0.1 mg L-1). At HRT equal to 4 h, N-NH4+ concentration did not change significantly during the downstream treatment in the anoxic tank, while N-NO3- concentration at the exit of the system was 1.4 ± 0.1 mg L-1. At the lowest HRT (3 h), N-NH4+ concentration was measured between 10 and 11 mg L-1, both, at the exit of the aeration tank and at the exit of the system; while, N-NO3- was measured 2.6 ± 0.2 mg L-1 at the exit of the system. On the other hand, BOD and TOC removal in the aeration tank decreased with the decrease of the HRT. BOD concentration at the exit of the anoxic tank measured 30.3 ± 2.2 and 19.4 ± 1.7 mg L-1 for HRTs 8 h or 4 h, respectively, while it was measured 51.6 ± 7.6 mg L-1 at HRT 3 h. On the other hand, TOC concentration at the outlet was measured 17.5 ± 1.2 and 13.2 ± 0.6 for HRTs 8 or 4 h, respectively, while it was measured 31.1 ± 5.6 mg L-1 at HRT equal to 3 h. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed significant variations of all measured parameters with the applied HRT, apart from N-NO3- concentration at the exit of the aerated tank. The latter was attributed to the complete oxidation oft N-NH4+ in the aerated tank at all HRTs. Based on the efficiency of the system, the volume of the aeration and denitrification tanks of a wastewater treatment plant using encapsulated microorganisms may be designed 16 times smaller, compared to conventional activated sludge plants, while the need for recirculation between the aerated and anoxic tanks may be completely eliminated.",Thermo-kinetics and product analysis of the catalytic pyrolysis of Pongamia residual cake.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31048229,Journal of environmental management,2019 05 17,"Catalytic fast pyrolysis of Pongamia residual cake (PRC) and the kinetics of this were evaluated using thermogravimetry and pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry analyses. The influence of the heating rate on the devolatilization process was studied to obtain corresponding kinetic information. Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose (KAS) and Flynn-Wall-Ozawa (FWO) model-free isoconversion methods were used to predict the kinetic parameters. The major thermal degradation of PRC occurred around 150-550 °C with an activation energy of 97.2-394.3 kJ/mol or 114.5-412.2 kJ/mol as determined by the KAS and FWO methods, respectively. Micro-scale pyrolysis trials were performed to determine the effects of the PRC particle size, reaction temperature and PRC: catalyst weight ratio on the pyrolytic product distribution and upgraded pyrolytic vapor properties for the 5 wt% Ni impregnated on activated carbon (AC), aluminium(III) oxide (Al2O3), kaolin and zeolite NaA supports. The results indicated that using a 1:5 PRC: Ni/AC catalyst weight ratio with medium-sized PRC particles (125-425 μm) was the most effective condition for the conversion of oxygenated (O)-compounds to hydrocarbons (HCs) through decarbonylation, decarboxylation and dehydration reactions, giving the highest decrease (99%) in O-compounds. Increased HC yields, to more than 58%, were also obtained with this catalyst. Similarly, using the other synthesized Ni catalysts resulted in a reduction in the O-compounds and production of favorable HC species, albeit to a lesser extent. Therefore, the catalytic pyrolysis process of this residue, especially with a Ni/AC catalyst, has the potential to be a viable option for producing upgraded pyrolysis oil, which may be applied as a quality alternative biofuel.",Decolorization and detoxification of Direct Blue 2B by indigenous bacterial consortium.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31048228,Journal of environmental management,2019 05 17,"Azo dyes are widely used in the textile industry despite being poorly biodegradable and highly toxic. Hence, azo dyes need to be removed from effluent prior to environmental discharge. Microbial communities are efficient for the degradation and mineralization of azo dyes. However, little is known about the functional microbial communities responsible for the degradation process. In this study, a novel indigenous bacteria consortium was developed for characterizing the functional microbial communities involved in the degradation of a sulfonated azo dye, Direct Blue 2B (DB2) in a simple batch reactor. The optimal temperature, pH, and salinity for the decolorization process were 38.70 °C, pH 7.57, and 20.10 g L-1 NaCl, respectively. The effect of the operating conditions on microbial community structure were determined using high-throughput Illumina HiSeq sequencing. Gammaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, and Bacilli were dominant under most of the operating conditions. At pH above 8 and NaCl concentration above 30 g L-1, Firmicutes relative abundance did not significantly change suggesting tolerance towards alkaline and hypersaline environments. Tritium aestivum and Glycine max seed germination following exposure to YHK treated DB2 solution was above 80% compared to 50% in untreated DB2 solution. The YHK consortium decolorized dyes structurally different from DB2 such as trimethyl phenyl and direct dyes. The results of this study offer valuable data on improving optimization of dye biodegradation processes and the capability of YHK in in situ bioremediation.",Synthesis and characterization of cobalt nanoparticles for application in the removal of textile dye.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31048227,Journal of environmental management,2019 05 17,"In this work, magnetic cobalt nanoparticles (CoNPs) were synthesized and applied to the removal of Remazol golden yellow RNL (RGY) from aqueous solutions and textile wastewater. The CoNPs were characterized and the Co content found in the CoNPs was 60.38% (m/m). The analysis of X-ray Diffraction (XRD) and Raman Spectroscopy indicated the presence of Co0 and CoO in the composition of the material, as confirmed by Thermogravimetric Analysis coupled to Mass Spectrometry (TG-MS). Images obtained by the Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) showed that the CoNPs have sizes smaller than 10 nm, sphere morphology and high agglomeration capacity. The results obtained by nitrogen adsorption-desorption suggested that the nanomaterial presented a mesoporous characteristic, low specific surface area (15.70 m2 g-1) and a pore volume and pore diameter of 0.072 cm3 g-1 and 3.64 nm, respectively. CoNPs removed the RGY with high efficiency, reaching almost 100% removal in 30 min. The kinetic results showed that the reaction followed pseudo-second-order kinetics. Additionally, the removal process can be altered depending on the experimental condition. For instance, under acidic conditions, the reductive degradation prevailed, while in neutral or basic conditions, two simultaneous processes occur: reductive degradation and adsorption. Finally, CoNPs were applied to textile wastewater. The results showed high discoloration, reaching almost 88%. However, there was only a 32% decrease in chemical oxygen demand, showing that CoNPs are efficient at removing organic dyes from aqueous solutions.",Effects of high-intensity interval training on the expression of microRNA-499 and pro- and anti-apoptotic genes in doxorubicin-cardiotoxicity in rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31048226,Journal of electrocardiology,2019 06 13,"Because clinical use of doxorubicin (DOX) in chemotherapy is limited due to cardiotoxicity, finding new strategies to alleviate DOX burden and improving patients' health are necessary.

However, the specific metabolic processes and dysfunctions associated with weight regain, and how they differ from initial weight gain, remain unclear. Thus, we examined the metabolic profiles of mice following weight regain compared to initial weight gain. Mice were fed a normal diet or a high-fat diet or were cycled between the two diets to alternate between obese and lean states. Liver samples were collected and hepatic metabolites were profiled using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). The identified metabolites associated with weight regain were quantified using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) and lipid profiles were assessed using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight MS (UPLC-QTOF-MS). In addition, changes in expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and gluconeogenic enzymes were investigated using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and western blotting, respectively. Hepatic levels of several amino acids were reduced in mice during weight regain compared with initial weight gain. In addition, gluconeogenic enzyme levels were increased following weight regain, indicating an up-regulation of gluconeogenesis. Lipidomic profiling revealed that levels of ceramide and sphingomyelin, which are related to obesity-induced inflammation, were significantly increased during weight regain compared to initial weight gain. Moreover, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) levels were significantly up-regulated during weight regain. In this study, weight regains lead to an up-regulation of gluconeogenesis and aggravated inflammation. Additionally, weight regain can worsen the metabolic dysfunction associated with obesity.","β-Carotene 15,15'-oxygenase inhibits cancer cell stemness and metastasis by regulating differentiation-related miRNAs in human neuroblastoma.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31048207,The Journal of nutritional biochemistry,2019 06 14,"Neuroblastoma (NB) is the most common pediatric malignancy and is considered to possess cancer stem cells (CSCs) properties which can drive tumor initiation and metastasis. β-carotene 15,15'-oxygenase (BCO1) is the main enzyme that catalyzes the first step in vitamin A biosynthesis from pro-vitamin A carotenoids. Retinoids (vitamin A) play a critical role in NB differentiation. However, the biological functions of BCO1 in NB remained to be elucidated. Here, we investigated the effects of BCO1 on NB CSCs with stably expressing BCO1 in NB cells. We show that BCO1 significantly suppressed self-renewal and markers of NB CSCs. Moreover, BCO1 inhibited the metastatic potential of NB cells and suppressed the enzymatic activity and expression of MMPs, as well as expression of HIF-1α and its downstream targets. In vivo, BCO1 reduced the metastatic incidence and volumes of metastatic tumors and downregulated the expression of CSCs markers, MMPs, and HIF-1α in tumor tissues of a mouse xenograft model. A possible mechanism underlying the anti-cancer activities of BCO1 is proposed based on miRNAs sequencing array data which suggests a role for BCO1 in regulating miRNAs associated with neuronal differentiation, cell-cell adhesion, and the Wnt signaling pathway. Thus, our results demonstrate new chemotherapeutic roles for BCO1 in malignant NB that mediate suppression of cancer stemness and metastasis.",Synergistic anti-inflammatory effects and mechanisms of combined phytochemicals.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31048206,The Journal of nutritional biochemistry,2019 06 14,"The anti-inflammatory effects of phytochemicals, bioactive components from plants having health benefits, have been heavily investigated in the last several decades. However, the gap between the high dosage demands (μM) of phytochemicals in vitro studies and the low bioavailability (nM) of most phytochemicals after consuming relevant foods/supplements in humans undermines the application of these phytochemicals in the prevention of chronic inflammation and its related chronic diseases in humans. One of the approaches to bridging this gap is to combine two or more phytochemicals/foods to synergistically prevent chronic inflammation. While increasing combinations of phytochemicals on anti-inflammation studies have been reported, there is no report dedicating why combining two or more phytochemicals synergistically attenuates chronic inflammation. In the present review, we summarized different types of combinations exerting synergistic anti-inflammatory effects such as the combination of phytochemicals from the same foods, and the combination of phytochemicals from different foods/plants. Particularly, we proposed five mechanisms including enhancing the bioavailability of phytochemicals, increasing antioxidant capacity, interacting with gut microbiome and targeting same and different signaling pathways, to understand how the combination of phytochemicals exerts synergistic anti-inflammatory effects in cells, animals, and humans. This review provides clues to boost more studies to combine several phytochemicals/foods to reduce chronic inflammation and prevent chronic diseases in humans.",Assessment of bioactivities of the human milk lactoferrin-osteopontin complex in vitro.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31048205,The Journal of nutritional biochemistry,2019 06 14,"Lactoferrin (LF) and osteopontin (OPN) are both multi-functional whey proteins present at high levels in human milk. These two proteins have a high affinity for each other due to their opposite charges; LF is a basic glycoprotein while OPN is an acidic phosphorylated glycoprotein. LF and OPN were identified to bind to each other over a decade ago, but potential functions of their complex remain unexplored. In this work, we investigated the characteristics of the LF-OPN complex with a focus on its bioactivities. Our results reveal a stronger stability of the LF-OPN complex towards in vitro digestion and more effective binding and uptake by human intestinal cells (HIEC) than LF or OPN alone show. Moreover, the LF-OPN complex promotes proliferation and differentiation of intestinal cells significantly more than the individual proteins do and shows an effect on anti-bacterial function and immune-stimulatory activities intermediate between those of LF and OPN. Thus, by forming a complex in human milk, LF and OPN may protect each other against proteolysis and enhance their individual bioactivities.",Food play: A novel research methodology for visceral geographers and health researchers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31048203,Health & place,2019 06 04,"This paper reinforces the value of visceral geographic approaches to health research as a method 'beyond talking'.

In this context, melamine-styrene based polymer (MSBP) was synthesized and characterized by different spectrophotometric methods. Sr2+ ions were removed from the solution using MSBP sorbent. In this respect, adsorption of Sr2+ onto melamine-based polymer was studied as a part of pH, amount of adsorbent, initial Sr2+ concentration, contact time, temperature and particle size. Also, adsorption rate of radioactive strontium was investigated by using LSC (Liquid Scintillation Counter). The adsorption data were fitted to Langmuir, Freundlich and Dubinin-Radushkevich (D-R) isotherm models. MSBP sorbent reached maximum adsorption capacity for Sr2+ as 142.9 mg.g-1. Thermodynamic parameters such as free energy (ΔG0), entropy (ΔS0) and enthalpy (ΔH0) of Sr2+ adsorption on MSBP were examined at five different temperatures of 293 K, 303 K, 313 K, 323 K and 333 K. 0 < ΔH0 values indicated that sorption mechanism presented endothermic feature. 0 > ΔG0 and 0 < ΔS0 revealed that Sr2+ adsorption on MSBP occurred spontaneously and irreversible, respectively.

The need for a differentiated account of the nature of scattering that allows using a selective filter as a means of increasing sensitivity is revealed. It is shown that the qualitatively different nature of changing the mass coefficients of coherent and incoherent scattering of gamma radiation from its energy and effective atomic number allows increasing sensitivity of ash measurement according to the value of the ratio of coherently and incoherently scattered gamma radiation intensities. There is given the comparison of the sensitivity data for various modifications of the gamma-albedo method.

Nucleic acids,2019 06 11,"Pseudouridine is the most prevalent RNA modification and has been found in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes. Currently, pseudouridine has been demonstrated in several kinds of RNAs, such as small nuclear RNA, rRNA, tRNA, mRNA, and small nucleolar RNA. Therefore, its significance to academic research and drug development is understandable. Through biochemical experiments, the pseudouridine site identification has produced good outcomes, but these lab exploratory methods and biochemical processes are expensive and time consuming. Therefore, it is important to introduce efficient methods for identification of pseudouridine sites. In this study, an intelligent method for pseudouridine sites using the deep-learning approach was developed. The proposed prediction model is called iPseU-CNN (identifying pseudouridine by convolutional neural networks). The existing methods used handcrafted features and machine-learning approaches to identify pseudouridine sites. However, the proposed predictor extracts the features of the pseudouridine sites automatically using a convolution neural network model. The iPseU-CNN model yields better outcomes than the current state-of-the-art models in all evaluation parameters. It is thus highly projected that the iPseU-CNN predictor will become a helpful tool for academic research on pseudouridine site prediction of RNA, as well as in drug discovery.",Influence of a 3' Terminal Ribozyme on AgoshRNA Biogenesis and Activity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31048184,Molecular therapy.

We called these molecules AgoshRNAs. Active anti-HIV AgoshRNAs were developed, but their RNAi activity was generally reduced compared with the matching shRNAs. In an attempt to further optimize the AgoshRNA design, we inserted several self-cleaving ribozymes at the 3' terminus of the transcribed AgoshRNA and evaluated the impact on AgoshRNA processing and activity. The hepatitis delta virus (HDV) ribozyme is efficiently removed from the transcribed AgoshRNAs and generates a uniform 3' overhang, which translates into the enhanced antiviral activity of these molecules.",Drug Resistance-Related Competing Interactions of lncRNA and mRNA across 19 Cancer Types.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31048183,Molecular therapy.

Competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) can influence drug response by participating in various biological processes, including regulation of cell cycle, signal transduction, and so on. In this study, we systematically explored resistance from the perspective of ceRNA modules. First, we constructed a general ceRNA network, involving 83 long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and 379 mRNAs. Next, we identified the drug resistance-related modules for 138 drugs and 19 cancer types, totaling 758 drug-cancer conditions. Function analysis showed that resistance-related biological processes were enriched in these modules, such as regulation of cell proliferation, DNA damage repair, and so on. Pan-drug and pan-cancer analyses revealed some common and specific modules across multiple drugs or cancers. In addition, we also found that drug pairs with common modules have similar structure, indicating high risk for multidrug resistance (MDR). Finally, we speculated that ceRNA pair GAS5-RPL8 could regulate drug resistance because low expression of GAS5 would enhance microRNA (miRNA)-mediated inhibition of RPL8. In total, we investigated the drug resistance by using ceRNA modules and proposed that ceRNA modules may be new markers for drug resistance that indicated a possible novel mechanism.",Circular RNA circCHFR Facilitates the Proliferation and Migration of Vascular Smooth Muscle via miR-370/FOXO1/Cyclin D1 Pathway.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31048182,Molecular therapy.

Functionally, the circCHFR silencing by oligonucleotide transfection suppressed the proliferation and migration ability of VSMCs. Mechanically, bioinformatics tools and luciferase reporter assay state that circCHFR acts as a sponge of miR-370, and miR-370 targets the 3' UTR of FOXO1. Furthermore, the transcription factor FOXO1 could bind with the promoter region of CCND1 mRNA and promote Cyclin D1 expression. In summary, this finding states the vital role of the circCHFR/miR-370/FOXO1/Cyclin D1 axis and provides a profound understanding about the circRNA in smooth muscle cells and atherosclerosis.",Limits of grape byproduct inclusion in diets for lambs: Zinc supplementation to prevent copper poisoning.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31048181,Research in veterinary science,2019 05 27,"The aims of the current study were to assess the inclusion levels of grape byproduct replacing jiggs hay in lambs diets and to evaluate signs of copper poisoning. Thirty-four Texel and Corriedale crossbred female lambs were used in a randomized block experimental design. The treatments comprised four levels of grape byproduct (0; 100; 200 and 300 g/kg DM) in replacement of jiggs hay. The diets were adjusted to the same ZnCu ratio (6:1) of the basal diet. Grape byproduct consumption at up to 30%, led to similar weight gain in the different treatments (P = .92), which was suitable for growing lambs. Grape byproduct in the diet had linear effect on GGT (P < .001) and AST (P < .0001) enzymes as well as on total bilirubin (P = .05). In addition, the highest grape byproduct addition showed the highest consumption of hay (P < .01). Hay replacement by grape byproduct at up to 300 g/kg in the DM was satisfactory to weight gain and did not negatively affect feed intake and weight gain of growing lambs. Maintaining zinc:copper ratio in sheep diets is not effective in preventing liver damage caused by increased dietary copper concentrations over a period of 70 days.",Reduced risk of stroke among psychiatric patients receiving ECT: A population-based cohort study in Taiwan.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31048180,Psychiatry research,2019 05 28,"Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) as well as the diseases it treats have been associated with stroke and cognitive impairment. We investigate the relationship between ECT and the subsequent development of stroke in patients with different severe mental illnesses. Tapping Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database, we identified patients diagnosed with severe mental illnesses who had received ECT between Jan 1, 2002 and Dec 31, 2007. A comparison cohort was constructed of patients who were matched by age, gender, and diagnosis but did not receive ECT. The patients were then followed up for occurrence of subsequent new-onset stroke. We identified 6264 patients had been diagnosed with mental illness and had received ECT. They were matched with 18,664 mentally ill patients who had not. The study cohort had a lower incidence of subsequent stroke than the matched controls, after controlling for age, diabetes, hypertension, coronary heart disease and enrollee sociodemographic category, risk factors for stroke in both study and control cohorts. ECT is associated with reduced risk of subsequent stroke in patients with severe mental illnesses in Taiwan. Therefore, clinicians should not let risk of stroke stop them from suggesting ECT to physically healthy patients who might benefit from this therapy.",Bioactive cell penetrating peptides and proteins in cancer: a bright future ahead.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31048179,Current opinion in pharmacology,2019 05 07,"Peptides and proteins bear an extraordinary therapeutic potential to effectively and selectively target many components of cells currently considered undruggable.

Natural organic matter (NOM) that mainly exists in the form of solid phase in soil can mediate MRF through electron shuttling functionality. However, whether a link exists between solid-phase NOM-mediated MRF in soil and the age of paddy field since the reclamation on fallow is unclear. Here, we use microbial reduction method to assess the solid-phase NOM-mediated MRF of paddy soils with different reclamation ages. The results show that solid-phase NOM-mediated MRF exhibits a positive response to land use change sequence from fallow to paddy field, indicating that the long-term natural development of paddy field favors the electron shuttling of NOM between cells and Fe(III) minerals. This increase in the electron shuttling of NOM is not due to the increase in the redox functional groups of NOM, but may be attributed to the formation of NOM-mineral complex through the synergistic increases in NOM content and transformation of soil texture from clay loam to loam. The decrease in the redox potential of Fe(III) minerals in soil caused by decreased pH and the increase in Fe content in the organic matter-complexed form may also partly facilitate electron transfer from NOM to Fe(III) minerals. Our work is useful in predicting the role of soil solid-phase NOM in mediating MRF in the context of long-term reclamation of paddy field and provides guidance for the environmental management of paddy fields.",Manipulating redox conditions to enhance in situ bioremediation of RDX in groundwater at a contaminated site.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31048167,The Science of the total environment,2019 05 21,"Surficial application of waste glycerol (WG) for enhanced bioremediation was tested in situ at an old military range site to address hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX) contaminated groundwater. This treatment was effective in inducing strong reducing conditions (range: -4 to -205 mV) and increasing the concentrations of organic carbon (from 10 to 729 mg/L) and fatty acids (from 0 to 940 mg/L) concomitantly with a decrease in RDX concentrations (range: 17 to 143 μg/L) to below detection limits (0.1 μg/L) in 2 of the 3 monitoring wells (MWs) evaluated. None of these changes were observed in the control MW. RDX disappeared without the detection of any common anaerobic nitroso degradation intermediates, with the exception of one MW where the concentration of organics did not significantly increase (range: 10 to 20 mg/L), suggesting the conditions were not favourable for biodegradation. Ecotoxicological analysis suggested that the use of WG may have some dose-related deleterious effects on different soil and aquatic receptors. Analysis of the microbial community composition, using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequences, which provided insight into whether the process design had selected for and stimulated the optimal microbial populations, indicated co-existence of numerous Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) belonging to groups known to be capable of RDX degradation under anaerobic conditions, with a positive link between Geobacter spp. enrichment and the presence of RDX nitroso metabolites. Overall, the results from this field test show that this treatment process can provide an effective long-term, semi-passive remediation option for RDX contaminated groundwater.",Combination of nejayote and swine wastewater as a medium for Arthrospira maxima and Chlorella vulgaris production and wastewater treatment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31048166,The Science of the total environment,2019 05 21,"Nejayote and swine wastewater are highly pollutant effluents and a source of organic matter load that sometimes released into water bodies (rivers or lakes), soils or public sewer system, with or without partial treatments. Nejayote is a wastewater product of alkaline cooking of maize, whereas, swine wastewater results from the primary production of pigs for the meat market. Owing to the presence of environmentally related pollutants, both sources are considered the major cause of pollution and thus require urgent action. Herein, we report a synergistic approach to effectively use and/or treat Nejayote and swine wastewater as a cost-effective culture medium for microalgae growth, which ultimately induces the removal of polluting agents. In this study, the strains Arthrospira maxima and Chlorella vulgaris were grown using different dilutions of Nejayote and swine wastewater. Both wastewaters were used as the only source of macronutrients and trace elements for growth. For A. maxima, the treatment of 10% nejayote and 90% of water (T3) resulted in a cell growth of 32 × 104 cell/mL at 12 days (μmax = 0.27/d). While, a mixture of 25% swine wastewater, 25% nejayote and 50% water (T2) produced 32 × 104 cell/mL at 18 days (μmax = 0.16/d). A significant reduction was also noted as 92% from 138 mg/L of TN, 75% from 77 mg/L of TP, and 96% from 8903 mg/L of COD, among different treatments. For C. vulgaris, the treatment of 10% swine wastewater and 90% water (T1) gave a cell growth of 128 × 106 cell/mL (μmax = 0.57/d) followed by T3 yielded 62 × 106 cell/mL (μmax = 0.70/d) and T2 yielded 48 × 106 cell/mL (μmax = 0.54/d). Up to 91% reduction from 138 mg/L of TN, 85% from 19 mg/L of TP and 96% from 4870 mg/L of COD was also recorded. These results show that microalgae can be used to treat these types of wastewater while at the same time using them as a culture media for microalgae. The resultant biomass can additionally be used for getting other sub-products of commercial interest.","Flood protection ecosystem services in the coast of Puerto Rico: Associations between extreme weather, flood hazard mitigation and gastrointestinal illness.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31048165,The Science of the total environment,2019 05 21,"Floods are becoming increasingly influential in coastal cities due to the intensification of extreme weather events. The impacts of flooding go beyond damages to infrastructure, it also affects human health. During floods, discharge of sewage into streets increases exposure to pathogens causing gastrointestinal (GI) illnesses. A potential strategy for coastal protection during weather hazards is the use of flood protection ecosystem services, but their effectiveness at ameliorating the impact of floods on GI illnesses remain understudied. Here we explore the relationship between extreme rainfall, flood protection ecosystem services, and the occurrence of Medicare claims for gastrointestinal (GI) illnesses in Puerto Rico. We first conducted model averaging to detect variables explaining flood impact for the years (1999-2014), and then used these variables as predictors in a spatio-temporal analysis of GI illness in the same period (1999-2013). Our results show that flood impact varies proportionally with extreme rainfall, and inversely with flood protection ecosystem services, particularly due to the presence of karst soils. The protective effect of karst soils is lost when there is a high percentage of people living in flood prone areas, as suggested by a significant interaction effect between these two variables. In support of our hypotheses, cases of GI illness also spike after extreme rainfall events and are affected by the interaction effect of karst soils and people living in flood prone areas. Our results support the linkage between extreme weather events, flood damages and GI illnesses, and suggests a buffering role of ecosystem services that promote rainfall infiltration. The relevance of these ecosystem services, however, is affected by planning decisions such as residential development in flood prone areas. Our results help inform planning strategies for future weather hazards, accounting for the role of natural and built infrastructure on minimizing flood impacts and human health effects.",Clogging in constructed wetlands: Indirect estimation of medium porosity by analysis of ground-penetrating radar images.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31048164,The Science of the total environment,2019 05 21,"Identification of the degree of porous medium clogging in constructed wetlands (CWs) is a complex procedure because bed obstruction is a phenomenon that occurs in the subsurface and involves several factors. Ideal methods must allow for subsurface analysis and be non-invasive, what is the case of ground penetrating radar (GPR or georadar) used for soil characterization. Thus, this work aimed to evaluate the use of GPR for clogging characterization of two full-scale horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetlands (HSSF-CWs), one unit planted with cattail (Typha latifolia) and the other unit with no vegetation. Both units received municipal sewage (50 p.e. each) previously treated in an anaerobic reactor, had been in operation for seven years (at the time the GPR was used) and showed signs of heavy clogging, leading to surface flow. In order to produce a standard for GPR image (created by the response of the reflected wave in the passage through different media) identification and association of colors with the environmental conditions inside the medium (cleaner or more obstructed condition), a clean granular rock filter (in operation for only one month), similar to the unplanted unit, was used. Equations developed for indirectly estimating the porosity, based on the RGB (red, green and blue) color scale, indicated that the methodology was in agreement with the visual conditions of surface flow occurrence in the HSSF-CW, showing to be a suitable non-invasive method to characterize the advancement of clogging in CWs.",Risk assessment and inactivation of invertebrate-internalized bacteria in pilot-scale biological activated carbon filtration.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31048163,The Science of the total environment,2019 05 21,"It is well documented that invertebrates can ingest and transport pathogenic bacteria, thus protecting the bacteria against disinfection in the laboratory. However, the risk assessment of and corresponding disinfection methods for natural invertebrate-internalized bacteria in biological activated carbon (BAC) filtration systems remain poorly understood. In this study, the risk of natural invertebrate-internalized bacteria was comprehensively assessed and methods to inactivate these bacteria were compared in a pilot-scale BAC filtration column study lasting one year. Seven groups of invertebrates dominated by rotifers and crustaceans were detected in the filtration column, five of which were collected for quantitative/qualitative identification of the bacteria they internalized. The community composition of internalized bacteria was analyzed via polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) coupled with sequence analysis of 16S rRNA gene fragments. Results showed that the average numbers of internalized bacteria per organism ranged from 160 to 6000, which increased exponentially with invertebrate body length. Some of the invertebrate-internalized bacteria were identified as opportunistic human pathogens, but no direct human pathogens were detected. A model was developed to calculate the residual bacteria concentration. Using this model, it was determined that an average of 800-100,000 CFU/m3 internalized bacteria would be protected and then released into the distribution mains after chlorination of 50 mg/L·min, with rotifers and copepods the dominant sources. Ozonation was more effective than both chlorination and UV radiation for inactivating the invertebrate-internalized bacteria.",Sediment alkaline-extracted organic matter (AEOM) fluorescence: An archive of Holocene marine organic matter origins.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31048161,The Science of the total environment,2019 05 21,"Organic matter (OM) is comprised of a complex mixture of substrates, which are difficult to fully characterize. Therefore a range of analytical approaches is applied to provide a better understanding of the dynamics and biogeochemical cycling of aquatic system. One approach is UV-Visible spectroscopy, which includes measurements of spectral absorption and fluorescence of colored and fluorescent fractions of dissolved OM (DOM, CDOM and FDOM). In this study OM fluorescence is characterized by excitation-emission matrix spectroscopy on alkaline extracted DOM from a Baltic Sea sediment core that spanned 8500 years and fluctuating levels of hypoxia. Our results showed that three underlying fluorescence components had strong correlations with carbon, nitrogen content and δ15N.

In this study, zebrafish embryos (6 h post-fertilization [hpf]) were exposed to 6:6, 6:8 and 8:8 PFPiAs individually (0.5, 5 and 50 nM) for 168 hpf. 8:8 PFPiA at 5 and 50 nM reduced the body length, while all treatments of 6:8 and 8:8 PFPiA depressed the heartbeat of the zebrafish larvae. 8:8 PFPiA at 50 nM distinctly enhanced the thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) contents. In a negative feedback mechanism, the three PFPiAs remarkably suppressed the genes responsible for THs regulation (corticotropin-releasing hormone, crh; thyroid stimulating hormone, tshβ), and 8:8 PFPiA displayed the strongest effect. In addition, 8:8 PFPiA significantly promoted the gene expressions corresponding to THs transport, metabolism and action (transthyretin, ttr; uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase, ugt1ab; deiodinases, dio1 and dio2; thyroid hormone receptors, trα and trβ). As a result, 8:8 PFPiA displayed the strongest thyroid endocrine disrupting effect and significantly affected the growth of zebrafish larvae among the three PFPiAs in the present study.",Study of marine debris around a tourist city in East China: Implication for waste management.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31048159,The Science of the total environment,2019 05 21,"Marine debris characterization is fundamental for developing policies aiming at ending the flow of marine debris at the source. China has the largest coastal population in the world. For this emerging economy, the sources of debris might be different from those in regions at different developmental stages. As a typical coastal tourist city and a special economic zone in East China, there are multiple sources of marine debris continuously produced around Xiamen. Marine debris characterization here could provide insights into regulatory measures. Therefore, the abundance and composition of marine debris around Xiamen were investigated. Average densities of floating, beached, benthic macro-debris and floating microplastics (0.5 mm - 5 mm) were 3963 ± 2027 items km-2, 0.13 ± 0.08 items m-2, 20,274 ± 15,873 items km-2 and 36,455 ± 33,935 items km-2, respectively. Based on the Clean Coast Indexes, the beaches investigated were supposed to be ""very clean"" most of the time (73.2% ± 34.9%). Wastes with low value for recycling/reuse, such as grocery bags, ropes, and foams, were the main items of marine debris in the study area. Both domestic sources from the upstream and local fishing/aquaculture activities significantly contributed to marine debris. Obvious regional differences in benthic debris categories could be explained by both natural factors and the rural-urban gap in economic levels, waste-management strategies and infrastructure. These might be common features in this emerging market and densely populated economy. The findings provide insights into the sources of mismanaged waste around this tourist city and some neglected deficiencies in China's current solid waste management system.","Changes in total mercury, methylmercury, and selenium blood levels during different life history stages of the Baltic grey seal (Halichoerus grypus grypus).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31048158,The Science of the total environment,2019 05 21,"Using the blood of grey seal pups, the blood and milk of female grey seals inhabiting the Hel Marine Station of Gdansk University's Institute of Oceanography (HMS), we monitored the transfer of total mercury (THg), methylmercury (MeHg), and selenium (Se) with blood during foetal life and nursing. Changes in the concentration of mercury and selenium were characterised in the pups' blood during their first three months of life when they transition from suckling, to a post-weaning fast, to eating fish. In the blood of pregnant females, there was a significant decrease in THg and MeHg concentrations throughout the gestation, indicating the transfer of these toxins through the placenta into the foetus. At no other stage of the pup's development was there such a high level of THg and MeHg as on the day of birth, despite the incorporation of mercury into the lanugo during foetal growth. This suggests that the maternal transfer of mercury during gestation may be the time of greatest mercury exposure for a young seal pup. The consumption of milk caused a rapid increase in weight and a lowering of the mercury level in the blood in the subsequent days of the pups' life. The postweaning fast was the period of the lowest mercury concentration. The switch to a diet consisting of fish caused a systematic increase in the concentration of mercury in the blood of the pups. Milk was the significant source of selenium for pups and the selenium concentration in females' blood was reduced during lactation. The nursing period seemed to have the greatest impact on the mercury and selenium blood levels in examined seals. Natural development of the grey seal pup created an opportunity to decrease the levels of toxic substances obtained through the maternal transfer during foetal growth."

Amination of hydrocarbons is an attractive tool for the creation of nitrogen-containing products. However, the multiple steps, harsh conditions, and low atom efficiencies often present in these reactions remain challenging. We present a multicomponent synthesis of functional benzimidazolones from arylamines, dialkylamines, and alcohols, acting via the sequence of copper-catalyzed oxidative tandem C-H aminations and alkyl deconstructive carbofunctionalization. The catalytic transformation forms multiple bonds in one single operation, uses readily available feedstocks and a naturally abundant Cu/O2 catalyst system, has broad substrate scope, avoids pre-installation of aminating agents and directing groups, and provides high chemo- and regioselectivity, resulting in direct functionalization of inert C-H and C-C bonds via single-electron oxidation-induced activation mode.

However, due to the intrinsic weak interaction between hybrid components, heterogeneous inorganic materials-induced AIE process was rarely reported. In this study, trace amounts of amorphous Ag2S microrods and an AIE-active liquid crystalline compound tetraphenylethylene-propylbenzene (TPE-PPE) were proposed to construct additional intense interaction to trigger AIE effect. The enhanced concentration of unsaturated Ag ions and excess positive charge on Ag2S surface promote a cation-π interaction with TPE-PPE, leading to a 36-fold increase in fluorescence, which is predominately high in luminescent liquid crystal system. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of the AIE process activated by cation-π interaction. This novel approach would provide guidance to fabricate high-luminescence meso phases for future luminescent display device.",Identification of Kinases Responsible for p53-Dependent Autophagy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31048145,iScience,2019 06 10,"In cancer, autophagy is upregulated to promote cell survival and tumor growth during times of nutrient stress and can confer resistance to drug treatments. Several major signaling networks control autophagy induction, including the p53 tumor suppressor pathway. In response to DNA damage and other cellular stresses, p53 is stabilized and activated, while HDM2 binds to and ubiquitinates p53 for proteasome degradation. Thus blocking the HDM2-p53 interaction is a promising therapeutic strategy in cancer; however, the potential survival advantage conferred by autophagy induction may limit therapeutic efficacy. In this study, we leveraged an HDM2 inhibitor to identify kinases required for p53-dependent autophagy. Interestingly, we discovered that p53-dependent autophagy requires several kinases, including the myotonic dystrophy protein kinase-like alpha (MRCKα). MRCKα is a CDC42 effector reported to activate actin-myosin cytoskeletal reorganization. Overall, this study provides evidence linking MRCKα to autophagy and reveals additional insights into the role of kinases in p53-dependent autophagy.",The significance of preoperative hematological inflammatory markers in patients with meningiomas.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31048144,Clinical neurology and neurosurgery,2019 06 05,This study was designed to evaluate whether preoperative hematological inflammatory markers would be useful in predicting the pathological grade of meningiomas.,Differential in vivo hemocyte responses to nano titanium dioxide in mussels: Effects of particle size.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31048143,"Aquatic toxicology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",2019 06 09,"Titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO2 NPs) are widely used in various products and inevitably released with different sizes and forms into aquatic environment.

Hemocyte parameters, including total hemocyte count (THC), hemocyte mortality (HM), phagocytosis activity (PA), lysosomal content (LC), esterase activity (EA), mitochondrial number (MN), mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and reactive oxygen species content (ROS) were evaluated in the mussels Mytilus coruscus exposed to two types of TiO2 NPs (25nm & 100nm: 0.1, 1, 10 mg/L, respectively). In general, size- and concentration-dependent toxicity was pronounced with 25nm-NP and highest concentration (10mg/L) being the most toxic. Alhough a slight recovery from the TiO2 exposure was observed, significant carry-over effects were still detected. These results highlight the importance of differential size effects of metal oxide NPs on toxicity mechanisms in aquatic animals.",Analysis of hydroxy-cocaine metabolites as evidence of cocaine consumption: Identification by parent ion search and quantitation by UHPLC-MS/MS in hair.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31048142,Journal of pharmaceutical and biomedical analysis,2019 06 04,"Over the last decade, hair analysis has become a routine procedure in most forensic laboratories and, complementary to blood and urine, hair is a unique biological matrix which gives the opportunity to establish a temporal consumption profile. Despite hair is widely used to identify drug use, environmental contamination continues to represent a challenging factor of this procedure, especially for cocaine (COC). In the last few years several strategies have been proposed in order to distinguish between actual use and external contamination, however the commonly detected COC metabolites probably are insufficient for demonstrating cocaine use through hair testing. Thus, the aim of this study is to develop an ultra high performance liquid cromatography - tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) method able to detect and quantify hydroxy-COC metabolites, as specific markers of COC abuse, in hair samples from COC consumers, thus enabling unambiguous evidence of COC consumption. At the beginning, since no commercial reference materials were available, COC-positive hair samples were tested using parent ion scan-based analysis to extract hydroxy COC metabolites target ions. Once identified, the reference materials were synthesized by our analytical laboratory allowing the development of the first UHPLC-MS/MS validated method to quantify p- and m-isomers of hydroxy COC, as well as hydroxy benzoylecgonine (BE) and hydroxy norcocaine (NCOC). The method was successfully applied to a large number of COC-positive hair samples and introduced into a routine procedure for testing drug ingestion in order to evaluate for the first-time hydroxy metabolites of COC ranges in hair and their correlation with COC and BE.",Characterization and identification of the chemical constituents of Polygonum multiflorum Thunb. by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with ultraviolet detection and linear ion trap FT-ICR hybrid mass spectrometry.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31048141,Journal of pharmaceutical and biomedical analysis,2019 06 04,"Dianthrone derivatives are minor constituents of Polygonum multiflorum Thunb. (PM). These derivatives are potential hepatotoxic components in PM. Fraction D6 contains many dianthrone derivatives and was successfully enriched using an efficient three-step approach. An effective and reliable high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) technique coupled with ultraviolet detection (UV) and a linear ion trap FT-ICR hybrid mass spectrometry (HPLC-UV/LTQ-FT-ICR-MS) method were successfully developed to separate and identify the dianthrones of the fraction D6. The characteristic diagnostic fragment ions and characteristic fragmentation pathway of the seven dianthrone standards, namely, Polygonumnolide B1 (S1), Polygonumnolide C3 (S2), Polygonumnolide C2 (S3), Polygonumnolide E (S4), Polygonumnolide A1 (S5), Polygonumnolide A2 (S6) and cis-emodin dianthrones (S7), were compared with unknown compounds in fraction D6, and 45 dianthrone derivatives were characterized or tentatively identified. Of these derivatives, 32 new dianthrone derivatives were tentatively characterized in PM. Therefore, LTQ-FT-ICR-MS combined with a selective enrichment method provided a powerful means for analyzing dianthrone derivatives. This study provides a meaningful basis for correcting some mistakes in previous studies, as well as further quality control and pharmacological and toxicological research.",Acylated sulfonamide adenosines as potent inhibitors of the adenylate-forming enzyme superfamily.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31048140,European journal of medicinal chemistry,2019 05 11,"The superfamily of adenylate-forming enzymes all share a common chemistry. They activate a carboxylate group, on a specific substrate, by catalyzing the formation of a high energy mixed phosphoanhydride-linked nucleoside intermediate. Members of this diverse enzymatic family play key roles in a variety of metabolic pathways and therefore many have been regarded as drug targets. A generic approach to inhibit such enzymes is the use of non-hydrolysable sulfur-based bioisosteres of the adenylate intermediate. Here we compare the activity of compounds containing a sulfamoyl and sulfonamide linker respectively. An improved synthetic strategy was developed to generate inhibitors containing the latter that target isoleucyl- (IleRS) and seryl-tRNA synthetase (SerRS), two structurally distinct representatives of Class I and II aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs). These enzymes attach their respective amino acid to its cognate tRNA and are indispensable for protein translation. Evaluation of the ability of the two similar isosteres to inhibit serRS revealed a remarkable difference, with an almost complete loss of activity for seryl-sulfonamide 15 (SerSoHA) compared to its sulfamoyl analogue (SerSA), while inhibition of IleRS was unaffected. To explain these observations, we have determined a 2.1 Å crystal structure of Klebsiella pneumoniae SerRS in complex with SerSA. Using this structure as a template, modelling of 15 in the active site predicts an unfavourable eclipsed conformation. We extended the same modelling strategy to representative members of the whole adenylate-forming enzyme superfamily, and were able to disclose a new classification system for adenylating enzymes, based on their protein fold. The results suggest that, other than for the structural and functional orthologues of the Class II aaRSs, the O to C substitution within the sulfur-sugar link should generally preserve the inhibitory potency.","Discovery of fluorescent coumarin-benzo[b]thiophene 1, 1-dioxide conjugates as mitochondria-targeting antitumor STAT3 inhibitors.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31048139,European journal of medicinal chemistry,2019 05 11,"STAT3 has been extensively studied as a potential antitumor target. Though studies on regulating STAT3 mainly focus on the inhibition of STAT3 phosphorylation at Tyr705 residue, the phosphorylation at Ser727 residue of STAT3 protein is also closely associated with the mitochondrial import of STAT3 protein. N, N-diethyl-7-aminocoumarin is a fluorescent mitochondria-targeting probe. In this study, a series of STAT3 inhibitors were developed by connecting N, N-diethyl-7-aminocoumarin fluorophore with benzo [b]thiophene 1, 1-dioxide moiety. All designed compounds displayed potent anti-proliferative activity against cancer cells. The representative compound 7a was mainly accumulated in mitochondria visualized by its fluorescence. STAT3 phosphorylation was inhibited by compound 7a at both Tyr705 and Ser727 residues. Compound 7a inhibited STAT3 phosphorylation whereas had no influence on the phosphorylation levels of STAT1, JAK2, Src and Erk1/2, indicating good selectivity of compound 7a. Moreover, compound 7a down-regulated the expression of STAT3 target genes Bcl-2 and Cyclin D1, increased ROS production and remarkably reduced the mitochondrial membrane potential to induce mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. Furthermore, compound 7ain vivo suppressed breast cancer 4T1 implanted tumor growth. Taken together, these results highlighted that compound 7a might be a promising mitochondria-targeting STAT3 inhibitor for cancer therapy.",The fate of rhenium in polyaminocarboxy solution: Hourglass crystal and its speciation study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31048138,Journal of hazardous materials,2019 06 08,"This paper studied the fate of Re in the presence of polyaminocarboxy ligand (DTPA, EDTA and NTA) under reducing condition. When SnCl2 as reducing agent, the results indicated the low valent Re was formed. And batch experiments studied the effect of pH and different ligands on the formation of low valent Re complex, the acid condition was favoured for the formation of low valent Re complex, and the order of complexing toward the low valent Re was the following: DTPA > EDTA > NTA. In the condition of pH = 1, DTPA as ligand, the hourglass crystal was obtained. Using ESI-MS, solid-state UV-Vis-NIR spectra, EXAFS, DFT calculation et al, the darkened patch of the hourglass crystal was demonstrated to be Re, and its speciation was dimeric Re2(μ-O)2DTPA."

Here, we report on an in silico study of members of the CTR1-like and EIN2-like polypeptide families from poplars. The expression of CTR1-like and EIN2-like genes such as Ptre-CTR1, Ptre-CTR3 and Ptre-EIN2a was studied in Populus tremula buds and leaves in response to dehydration, various light conditions and under senescence. In buds under dehydration, the maximal fold-change of the Ptre-CTR1, Ptre-CTR3 and Ptre-EIN2a expression level recorded almost identical values. This suggests that maintenance of a constant ratio between the transcript levels of genes encoding positive and negative ethylene signalling components is required under stress. The expression of the studied genes was 1.4-to 3-fold higher in response to darkness, but 4.5- to 51.2-fold and 21.6- to 51.2-fold higher under the early and moderate leaf senescence, respectively. It is worth noting that the senescence-related Ptre-EIN2a and Ptre-CTR3a expression profiles were very similar. Using in vitro assays, we demonstrated the ability of the catalytic domain of Ptre-CTR1 to phosphorylate the Ptre-EIN2a-like polypeptide, which is similar to that in Arabidopsis. The target substrate, the Ptre-CEND2a polypeptide (C-terminal part of Ptre-EIN2a), was only phosphorylated by the protein kinase Ptre-CTR1 and not by Ptre-CTR3. Moreover, the addition of Ptre-CTR3 polypeptides (-CTR3a or -CTR3b forms) to the reaction mixture had an inhibitory effect on Ptre-CTR1 auto- and trans-phosphorylation. In contrast to Ptre-CTR1, Ptre-CTR3 may act as a positive regulator in ethylene signalling in poplar; however, this hypothesis requires in vivo confirmation. Thus, the ethylene signalling route in poplar seems to be under the control of certain additional mechanisms which have not been reported in Arabidopsis.",Metabolic response and correlations between ions and metabolites in Phragmites communis under long-term salinity toxicity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31048122,Plant physiology and biochemistry : PPB,2019 05 17,"Phragmites communis has a long history in Songnen grassland of China and has a series of biological, ecological as well as genetic characteristics contributing to its adaptation to the specific local climatic and edaphic conditions. The aim of the present study was to investigate the ions balance and their relationship to metabolites in P. communis under three salinity stress conditions. Results showed that the contents of Na+, Cl-, and SO42- significantly increased in P. communis leaves, while K+, Mg2+, and Mn2+ decreased. Moreover, Na+ and Cl- had significant negative correlations with metabolites involved in the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle), and significant positive correlations with glycolysis. The metabolite results showed that high contents of sugars and proline played important roles in developing salinity tolerance, indicating that glycolysis and proline biosynthesis were enhanced; however, this consumes large amounts of energy and likely caused the TCA cycle to be inhibited. The results suggested that P. communis might enhance its salinity tolerance mainly through increased glycolysis and energy consumption. In addition, restricting Na+ accumulation and increasing of Cl-, and rearrangement of metabolite production in P. communis tissues are possible causes of salinity tolerance. Therefore, salinity caused systems alterations in widespread metabolic networks involving TCA cycle, glycolysis and proline biosynthesis. These findings provided new insights for the P. communis metabolic adaptation to salinity and demonstrated the ions balance and metabolites in P. communis are possibly attributable to development of salinity tolerance.",Ectopic expression of the Aechmea fasciata APETALA2 gene AfAP2-2 reduces seed size and delays flowering in Arabidopsis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31048121,Plant physiology and biochemistry : PPB,2019 05 17,"The Bromeliaceae family, which is distributed pantropically, is one of the most morphologically diverse families. Except for the edible pineapple (Ananas comosus), the vast majority of bromeliads cultivated worldwide are appreciated mainly for their ornamental value. As subtropical and tropical flowering plants, these bromeliads, among with Aechmea fasciata, have significant economic importance. However, the molecular mechanism of flowering in bromeliads remains unrevealed. In this study, an APETALA2 (AP2) homologue, AfAP2-2, which belongs to the AP2/ethylene response element binding protein (AP2/EREBP) transcription factor superfamily, was identified in A. fasciata. AfAP2-2 contains two conserved AP2 domains and is a nuclear-localized transactivator. The expression level of AfAP2-2 was predominantly higher in vegetative organs of the reproductive phase than in those of the vegetative phase. Ectopic expression of AfAP2-2 in Arabidopsis specifically delayed flowering in short-day (SD) conditions. Furthermore, the size and weight of seeds of AfAP2-2-overexpressing Arabidopsis plants were significantly reduced compared to those of the wild type (WT). Our findings suggest that AfAP2-2 might be a negative regulator of flowering and seed size and weight. These results may help facilitate the molecular breeding of bromeliads.",Synthesis and in vitro antitumor activity of novel acylspermidine derivative N-(4-aminobutyl)-N-(3-aminopropyl)-8-hydroxy-dodecanamide (AAHD) against HepG2 cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31048120,Bioorganic chemistry,2019 06 11,"Naturally occurring polyamines like Putrescine, Spermidine, and Spermine are polycations which bind to the DNA, hence stabilizing it and promoting the essential cellular processes. Many synthetic polyamine analogues have been synthesized in the past few years, which have shown cytotoxic effects on different tumours. In the present study, we evaluated the antiproliferative effect of a novel, acylspermidine derivative, (N-(4-aminobutyl)-N-(3-aminopropyl)-8-hydroxy-dodecanamide) (AAHD) on HepG2 cells. Fluorescence staining was performed with nuclear stain (Hoechst 33342) and acridine orange/ethidium bromide double staining. Dose and the time-dependent antiproliferative effect were observed by WST-1 assays, and radical scavenging activity was measured by ROS. Morphological changes such as cell shrinkage & blebbing were analyzed by fluorescent microscopy. It was found that AAHD markedly suppressed the growth of HepG2 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. It was also noted that the modulation of ROS levels confirmed the radical scavenging activity. In the near future, AAHD can be a promising drug candidate in chalking out a neoplastic strategy to control the proliferation of tumour cells. This study indicated that AAHD induced anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic activities on HCC. Since AAHD was active at micromolar concentrations without any adverse effects on the healthy cells (Fibroblasts), it is worthy of further clinical investigations.",Synthesis of thymol-based pyrazolines: An effort to perceive novel potent-antimalarials.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31048119,Bioorganic chemistry,2019 06 11,"A series of thymol based substituted pyrazolines and chalcones was synthesized and evaluated for antimalarial activity, using in-vitro and in-vivo malaria models. All the target compounds (5a-k and 6a-j) were found to be active against human malaria parasite strain Plasmodium falciparum NF54. Among all, compounds 5e and 5f of chalcone series and 6c and 6f of pyrazoline series exhibited prominent antimalarial activity with IC50 less than 3 and 2 μM respectively, while other pyrazolines also significantly inhibited the P. falciparum with IC50 less than 10 μM. The designed pharmacophores were found to be effective against P. falciparum. Compound 6f was found to be able to retard malaria progression in mice. This was evident through decreased parasitemia, increased mean survival time and hemoglobin content in the treated animals. Moreover, 6f was observed as an inhibitor of heme polymerization pathway of the malaria parasite. It also inhibited free heme degradation, which could be possibly responsible for higher reactive oxygen species (ROS) in parasite, thus inhibiting the rapid proliferation of the parasite. In addition to this, compound 6f was found to be non-toxic with a good selectivity index. Based on these observations, the compound 6f could be taken up for further antimalarial lead optimization studies.",Fucoidans from the phaeophyta Scytosiphon lomentaria: Chemical analysis and antiviral activity of the galactofucan component.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31048118,Carbohydrate research,2019 05 20,"The brown seaweed Scytosiphon lomentaria produces moderate amounts of fucoidans. By cetrimide fractionation, typical heavily sulfated galactofucans are obtained, with no major signs of chemical heterogeneity, together with fractions with higher proportions of xylose, mannose and uronic acids. Anyway, fucose is the most important monosaccharide in most of the subfractions of the subsequent extracts. The fucan moieties appear to be mostly as 3-linked α-l-fucopyranosyl units, with several patterns of sulfate and branching. Galactose is mostly 6-linked, whereas mannose appears to be 2-linked, and xylose appears mostly as terminal stubs. Small amounts of 2-O-acetylated fucose units appear. A high and selective antiviral activity against HSV-1 and HSV-2 was determined for the galactofucan fractions whereas the uronofucoidans were inactive."
