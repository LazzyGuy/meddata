Hormones are the chemical regulators of the human body and function critically to maintain various processes, such as growth, emotions and even cognition. Numerous studies have examined the relationship between hormonal effects and cognitive function; these studies have investigated different factors, such as aging, pregnancy, post-natal states, emotions and stress. Different types of hormones produce different outcomes for the human body and mind. Hormones may also contribute to both positive and negative outcomes, depending on whether the hormone levels are too low or too high. To investigate the hormonal effects on cognitive function, the sources of localisation must be localised, so that the neuronal network can be realised. Furthermore, cognitive function does not rely on a specific brain region but is determined by the neuronal network interactions. Thus, it is worthwhile to know the neural mechanisms behind cognitive functions that are affected by hormones.",An Evidence-Based Review: The Effects of Malaysian Traditional Herbs on Osteoporotic Rat Models.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30914844,The Malaysian journal of medical sciences : MJMS,2019 03 29,"Osteoporosis is considered a silent disease, the early symptoms of which often go unrecognised. Osteoporosis causes bone loss, reduces mineralised density, and inevitably leads to bone fracture. Hormonal deficiencies due to aging or drug induction are also frequently attributed to osteoporosis. Nevertheless, the phytochemical content of natural plants has been proven to significantly reduce osteoporotic conditions. A systematic review was conducted by this study to identify research specifically on the effects of Malaysian herbs such as Piper sarmentosum, Eurycoma longifolia and Labisia pumila on osteoporotic bone changes. This review consisted of a comprehensive search of five databases for the effects of specific herbs on osteoporotic bone change. These databases were Web of Science (WOS), Medline, Scopus, ScienceDirect and PubMed. The articles were selected throughout the years, were limited to the English language and fully documented. Duplication, irrelevant titles, different herbs and in vitro studies were excluded, including those that are not original research papers. A total of 399 potential studies were identified, but only 21 samples were accepted based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Six of the twenty one studies were on Piper sarmentosum, six on Eurycoma longifolia, and the remaining nine studies were on Labisia pumila. Overall, in three of the studies a glucocorticoid-induced model was used, while in 12 of the studies an ovariectomised model was used, and for the other six studies an orchidectomised model was used as the osteoporotic model. All of the studies reported varied results based on the type of herbs used, but in comparison to Eurycoma longifolia, Piper sarmentosum and Labisia pumila recorded better anti-osteoporotic effects, while the majority of studies on Eurycoma longifolia were unable to preserve bone strength.",Two new endophytic Colletotrichum species from Nothapodytespittosporoides in China.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30914842,MycoKeys,2019 05 04,"Two new endophytic species, Colletotrichumjishouensesp. nov. and.

Thirty-four species are included, 26 corresponding to species in three genera of bromeliads, and eight species in six genera of orchids. The new records represent 26.5% of the total listed in the area; nine of them are new records for the Reserve (RBBM) and one is new for Hidalgo State. This study reveals that endemism for both families is very important in the Reserve (55.88%), since it includes 13 Mexican bromeliads, of which two are endemic to Hidalgo and one to the Reserve, and three orchids, two endemic to Mexico and one to the Reserve. We found species with different types of relative abundance: rare (16) and occasional (7). Additionally, we include information about the category (IUCN, CITES, NOM-059-SEMARNAT) as well as uses reported in the literature for the species in the RBBM. The checklist is strictly based on information obtained from deposited herbarium specimens as well as from those collected during fieldwork. We suggest that a conservation plan (in situ and ex situ) for the RBBM is important and necessary. The predominant habit for both families is epiphytic (17 species); even though there are terrestrial (7) and saxicolous (2), and the remaining are facultative species (8). Nine species are included in some risk category. The present work is the most complete and updated list of Bromeliaceae and Orchidaceae for this important natural area in the Mexican State of Hidalgo. However, more fieldwork is needed to document the biodiversity of the area in general and its flora in particular, as a way to highlight the importance of protected areas in preserving biodiversity."

Our results show that more than half of the respondents indicated that there are still significant challenges to be addressed in achieving equitably managed PAs, particularly in ensuring effective participation in decision-making, transparent procedures, access to justice in conflicting situations, and the recognition of the rights and diversity of local people. Our findings are a first and fundamental contribution toward a global assessment of equitable management in PAs to report on Aichi Target 11 in 2020 and help define the next set of PA targets from 2020-2030.",Phenotypic spectrum associated with a CRADD founder variant underlying frontotemporal predominant pachygyria in the Finnish population.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30914828,European journal of human genetics : EJHG,2019 03 27,"Intellectual disability (ID), megalencephaly, frontal predominant pachygyria, and seizures, previously called ""thin"" lissencephaly, are reported to be caused by recessive variants in CRADD. Among five families of different ethnicities identified, one homozygous missense variant, c.509G>A p.(Arg170His), was of Finnish ancestry. Here we report on the phenotypic variability associated for this potential CRADD founder variant in 22 Finnish individuals. Exome sequencing was used to identify candidate genes in Finnish patients presenting with ID. Targeted Sanger sequencing and restriction enzyme analysis were applied to screen for the c.509G>A CRADD variant in cohorts from Finland. Detailed phenotyping and genealogical studies were performed. Twenty two patients were identified with the c.509G>A p.(Arg170His) homozygous variant in CRADD. The majority of the ancestors originated from Northeastern Finland indicating a founder effect. The hallmark of the disease is frontotemporal predominant pachygyria with mild cortical thickening. All patients show ID of variable severity. Aggressive behavior was found in nearly half of the patients, EEG abnormalities in five patients and megalencephaly in three patients. This study provides detailed data about the phenotypic spectrum of patients with lissencephaly due to a CRADD variant that affects function. High inter- and intrafamilial phenotypic heterogeneity was identified in patients with pachygyria caused by the homozygous CRADD founder variant. The phenotype variability suggests that additional genetic and/or environmental factors play a role in the clinical presentation. Since frontotemporal pachygyria is the hallmark of the disease, brain imaging studies are essential to support the molecular diagnosis for individuals with ID and a CRADD variant.",Navigating metabolic pathways to enhance antitumour immunity and immunotherapy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30914826,Nature reviews. Clinical oncology,2019 03 27,"The development of immunotherapies over the past decade has resulted in a paradigm shift in the treatment of cancer. However, the majority of patients do not benefit from immunotherapy, presumably owing to insufficient reprogramming of the immunosuppressive tumour microenvironment (TME) and thus limited reinvigoration of antitumour immunity. Various metabolic machineries and nutrient-sensing mechanisms orchestrate the behaviour of immune cells in response to nutrient availability in the TME. Notably, tumour-infiltrating immune cells typically experience metabolic stress as a result of the dysregulated metabolic activity of tumour cells, leading to impaired antitumour immune responses. Moreover, the immune checkpoints that are often exploited by tumour cells to evade immunosurveillance have emerging roles in modulating the metabolic and functional activity of T cells. Thus, repurposing of drugs targeting cancer metabolism might synergistically enhance immunotherapy via metabolic reprogramming of the TME. In addition, interventions targeting the metabolic circuits that impede antitumour immunity have been developed, with several clinical trials underway. Herein, we discuss how these metabolic circuits regulate antitumour immunity and the possible approaches to targeting these pathways in the context of anticancer immunotherapy. We also describe hypothetical combination treatments that could be used to better unleash the potential of adoptive cell therapies by enhancing T cell metabolism.",MIF family proteins in genitourinary cancer: tumorigenic roles and therapeutic potential.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30914802,Nature reviews. Urology,2019 05 04,"Genitourinary cancers encompass some of the most common solid tumours and have high rates of morbidity and mortality. Inflammation is associated with enhanced tumorigenesis, and a number of pro-inflammatory mediators, such as macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), also promote tumorigenesis. Studies of the role of MIF (which largely functions via the type II transmembrane receptor CD74) in prostate, bladder and kidney cancers suggest that it is a pro-tumorigenic factor in genitourinary malignancy. Inhibiting MIF activity in cell culture and in preclinical animal models of genitourinary cancers reduces the phenotypic hallmarks of cancer, such as proliferation, angiogenesis and tumour aggressiveness, by downregulating signalling pathways such as those regulated by extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), protein kinase B and p53, and MIF may also reverse immunosuppression. Progress has been made in our understanding of the role of MIF (and its family member D-dopachrome tautomerase (DDT)) in genitourinary cancers and how it can be therapeutically targeted.",FDPS cooperates with PTEN loss to promote prostate cancer progression through modulation of small GTPases/AKT axis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30914801,Oncogene,2019 04 01,"Farnesyl diphosphate synthase (FDPS), a mevalonate pathway enzyme, is highly expressed in several cancers, including prostate cancer (PCa). To date, the mechanistic, functional, and clinical significance of FDPS in cancer remains unexplored. We evaluated the FDPS expression and its cancer-associated phenotypes using in vitro and in vivo methods in PTEN-deficient and sufficient human and mouse PCa cells and tumors. Interestingly, FDPS overexpression synergizes with PTEN deficiency in PTEN conditionally knockout mice (P < 0.05) and expressed significantly higher in human (P < 0.001) PCa tissues, cell lines, and murine tumoroids compared to respective controls. In silico analysis revealed that FDPS is associated with increasing Gleason score, PTEN functionally deficient status, and poor survival of PCa. Ectopic overexpression of FDPS promotes oncogenic phenotypes such as colony formation (P < 0.01) and proliferation (P < 0.01) through activation of AKT and ERK signaling by prenylating Rho A, Rho G, and CDC42 small GTPases. Of interest, knockdown of FDPS in PCa cells exhibits decreased colony growth and proliferation (P < 0.001) by modulating AKT and ERK pathways. Further, genetic and pharmacological inhibition of PI3K but not AKT reduced FDPS expression. Pharmacological targeting of FDPS by zoledronic acid (ZOL), which is already in clinics, exhibit reduced growth and clonogenicity of human and murine PCa cells (P < 0.01) and 3D tumoroids (P < 0.02) by disrupting AKT and ERK signaling through direct interference of small GTPases protein prenylation. Thus, FDPS plays an oncogenic role in PTEN-deficient PCa through GTPase/AKT axis. Identifying mevalonate pathway proteins could serve as a therapeutic target in PTEN dysregulated tumors.",Targeting AU-rich element-mediated mRNA decay with a truncated active form of the zinc-finger protein TIS11b/BRF1 impairs major hallmarks of mammary tumorigenesis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30914800,Oncogene,2019 03 27,"Altered expression of regulatory RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) in cancer leads to abnormal expression of mRNAs encoding many factors involved in cancer hallmarks. While conventional anticancer therapies usually target one pathway at a time, targeting key RBP would affect multiple genes and thus overcome drug resistance. Among the Tristetraprolin family of RBP, TIS11b/BRF1/ZFP36L1 mediates mRNA decay through binding to Adenylate/Uridylate (AU-rich elements) in mRNA 3'-untranslated region and recruitment of mRNA degradation enzymes. Here, we show that TIS11b is markedly underexpressed in three breast cancer cell lines, as well as in breast tumor samples. We hypothesized that restoring intracellular TIS11b levels could impair cancer cell phenotypic traits. We thus generated a derivative of TIS11b called R9-ZnCS334D, by combining N-terminal domain deletion, serine-to-aspartate substitution at position 334 to enhance the function of the protein and fusion to the cell-penetrating peptide polyarginine R9. R9-ZnCS334D not only blunted secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) but also inhibited proliferation, migration, invasion, and anchorage-independent growth of murine 4T1 or human MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Moreover, R9-ZnCS334D prevented endothelial cell organization into vessel-like structures, suggesting that it could potentially target various cell types within the tumor microenvironment. In vivo, injection of R9-ZnCS334D in 4T1 tumors impaired tumor growth, decreased tumor hypoxia, and expression of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers Snail, Vimentin, and N-cadherin. R9-ZnCS334D also hindered the expression of chemokines and proteins involved in cancer-related inflammation and invasion including Fractalkine (CX3CL1), SDF-1 (CXCL12), MCP-1 (CCL2), NOV (CCN3), and Pentraxin-3 (PTX3). Collectively, our data indicate that R9-ZnCS334D counteracts multiple traits of breast cancer cell aggressiveness and suggest that this novel protein could serve as the basis for innovative multi-target therapies in cancer.",GPNMB augments Wnt-1 mediated breast tumor initiation and growth by enhancing PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway signaling and β-catenin activity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30914799,Oncogene,2019 03 27,"Glycoprotein Nmb (GPNMB) is overexpressed in triple-negative and basal-like breast cancers and its expression is predictive of poor prognosis within this aggressive breast cancer subtype. GPNMB promotes breast cancer growth, invasion, and metastasis; however, its role in mammary tumor initiation remains unknown. To address this question, we overexpressed GPNMB in the mammary epithelium to generate MMTV/GPNMB transgenic mice and crossed these animals to the MMTV/Wnt-1 mouse model, which is known to recapitulate features of human basal breast cancers. We show that GPNMB alone does not display oncogenic properties; however, its expression dramatically accelerates tumor onset in MMTV/Wnt-1 mice. MMTV/Wnt-1 × MMTV/GPNMB bigenic mice also exhibit a significant increase in the growth rate of established primary tumors, which is attributable to increased proliferation and decreased apoptosis. To elucidate molecular mechanisms underpinning the tumor-promoting effects of GPNMB in this context, we interrogated activated pathways in tumors derived from the MMTV/Wnt-1 and MMTV/Wnt-1 × MMTV/GPNMB mice using RPPA analysis. These data revealed that MMTV/Wnt-1 × MMTV/GPNMB bigenic tumors exhibit a pro-growth signature characterized by elevated PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling and increased β-catenin activity. Furthermore, we extended these observations to an independent Wnt-1 expressing model of aggressive breast cancer, and confirmed that GPNMB enhances canonical Wnt pathway activation, as evidenced by increased β-catenin transcriptional activity, in breast cancer cells and tumors co-expressing Wnt-1 and GPNMB. GPNMB-dependent engagement of β-catenin occurred, in part, through AKT activation. Taken together, these data ascribe a novel, pro-growth role for GPNMB in Wnt-1 expressing basal breast cancers.","LINC00162 confers sensitivity to 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine via modulation of an RNA splicing protein, HNRNPH1.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30914798,Oncogene,2019 03 27,"DNA demethylation therapy is now expanding from hematological tumors to solid tumors. To exploit its maximum efficacy, long-term treatment is needed, and stratification of sensitive patients is critically important. Here, we identified a long non-coding RNA, LINC00162, as highly and frequently expressed in gastric cancer cell lines sensitive to 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC). Knockdown of LINC00162 decreased the sensitivity while its overexpression increased the sensitivity. In vivo experiments also showed that LINC00162 overexpression increased the sensitivity. LINC00162 enhanced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis induced by 5-aza-dC, but did not affect its DNA demethylation effect. Mechanistically, LINC00162 interacted with an RNA splicing protein, HNRNPH1, and decreased splicing of an anti-apoptotic splicing variant, BCL-XL. LINC00162 may have translational value to predict patients who will respond to 5-aza-dC.",The adjuvant treatment of kidney cancer: a multidisciplinary outlook.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30914797,Nature reviews. Nephrology,2019 03 27,"Approximately 70% of cases of kidney cancer are localized or locally advanced at diagnosis. Among patients who undergo surgery for these cancers, 30-35% will eventually develop potentially fatal metachronous distant metastases. Effective adjuvant treatments are urgently needed to reduce the risk of recurrence of kidney cancer and of dying of metastatic disease. To date, almost all of the tested adjuvant agents have failed to demonstrate any benefit. Only two trials of an autologous renal tumour cell vaccine and of the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor sunitinib have shown positive results, but these have been criticized for methodological reasons and conflicting data, respectively. The results of two additional trials of targeted agents as adjuvant therapies have not yet been published. Novel immune checkpoint inhibitors are promising approaches to adjuvant therapy in kidney cancer, and a number of trials are now underway. An important component of the management of patients with kidney cancer, particularly those who undergo radical resection for localized renal cell carcinoma, is the preservation of kidney function to reduce morbidity and mortality. The optimal management of these patients therefore requires a multidisciplinary approach involving nephrologists, oncologists, urologists and pathologists.",Investigation into the Molecular Mechanisms underlying the Anti-proliferative and Anti-tumorigenesis activities of Diosmetin against HCT-116 Human Colorectal Cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30914796,Scientific reports,2019 04 03,"Diosmetin (Dis) is a bioflavonoid with cytotoxicity properties against variety of cancer cells including hepatocarcinoma, breast and colorectal (CRC) cancer. The exact mechanism by which Dis acts against CRC however, still remains unclear, hence in this study, we investigated the possible molecular mechanisms of Dis in CRC cell line, HCT-116. Here, we monitored the viability of HCT-116 cells in the presence of Dis and investigated the underlying mechanism of Dis against HCT-116 cells at the gene and protein levels using NanoString and proteome profiler array technologies. Findings demonstrated that Dis exhibits greater cytotoxic effects towards HCT-116 CRC cells (IC50 = 3.58 ± 0.58 µg/ml) as compared to the normal colon CCD-841 cells (IC50 = 51.95 ± 0.11 µg/ml). Arrests of the cells in G2/M phase confirms the occurrence of mitotic disruption via Dis. Activation of apoptosis factors such as Fas and Bax at the gene and protein levels along with the release of Cytochrome C from mitochondria and cleavage of Caspase cascades indicate the presence of turbulence as a result of apoptosis induction in Dis-treated cells. Moreover, NF-ƙB translocation was inhibited in Dis-treated cells. Our results indicate that Dis can target HCT-116 cells through the mitotic disruption and apoptosis induction."

Recently, B7H3 functions beyond immune costimulation have been demonstrated. However, the mechanisms underlying B7H3 function are diverse and not well understood. GBM tumors contain undifferentiated self-renewing cells, which confound therapeutic attempts. We investigated the role of B7H3 in the regulation of GBM cell differentiation and the regulatory pathways involved. Analysis of public databases (TCGA, Rembrandt, and GEO NCBI) and RNA sequencing were performed to explore the role of B7H3 in GBM. Knockdown and overexpression of B7H3, were used to verify the downstream pathway in vitro. Further studies in vivo were performed to support the new finding. Bioinformatics analysis identified a correlation between the expression of B7H3, the expression of glioma self-renewing cell (GSC)-related genes, and MYC expression. These observations were verified by RNA-sequencing analyses in primary GBM cell lines. In vitro knockdown of B7H3-induced differentiation, associated with downregulation of SMAD6 (a TGF-β pathway inhibitor) and enhancement of SMAD1 phosphorylation-induced SMAD4 expression. Importantly, activation of the TGF-β pathway resulted in downregulation of MYC expression. In vivo assays conducted in a human GBM cell line xenograft mouse model demonstrated that B7H3 knockdown decreased MYC expression and inhibited tumor growth. B7H3 knockdown could regulate GBM differentiation by modulating MYC expression. So, B7H3 could serve as a potential theranostic target for the treatment of patients with GBM.",Reproductive success delays moult phenology in a polar mammal.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30914781,Scientific reports,2019 04 03,"Animals can respond to dynamic environments through phenological plasticity of life history events; however, changes in one part of the annual cycle can diminish the success of subsequent life history events. Our aims were to determine the associations between reproduction and moult phenology across years and to quantify phenological plasticity across varying environmental conditions. We conducted demographic surveys of 4,252 flipper-tagged Weddell seals (Leptonychotes weddellii) in the Ross Sea, Antarctica during four austral summers. At each sighting, seals were assigned a moult code based on the visible presence of new fur and the start date of each animal's moult was back-calculated. Reproductive success and parturition dates were obtained for the breeding season prior to and following the moult. We found that successful reproduction delayed moult by 16 days relative to non-parturient females. Phenology of the intervening moult was indicative of previous reproductive dynamics but not predictive of subsequent reproductive outcomes. Across years, moult phenology varied by about two weeks and covaried strongly with sea ice break-out timing for all reproductive categories. Our findings suggest these polar mammals have some flexibility within the annual cycle that allows adjustment of moult phenology to fluctuating environmental conditions without compromising future reproductive success.",Vestibular processing during natural self-motion: implications for perception and action.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30914780,Nature reviews. Neuroscience,2019 06 10,"How the brain computes accurate estimates of our self-motion relative to the world and our orientation relative to gravity in order to ensure accurate perception and motor control is a fundamental neuroscientific question. Recent experiments have revealed that the vestibular system encodes this information during everyday activities using pathway-specific neural representations. Furthermore, new findings have established that vestibular signals are selectively combined with extravestibular information at the earliest stages of central vestibular processing in a manner that depends on the current behavioural goal. These findings have important implications for our understanding of the brain mechanisms that ensure accurate perception and behaviour during everyday activities and for our understanding of disorders of vestibular processing.",Diagnosis of congenital/perinatal infections by neonatologists: a national survey.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30914779,Journal of perinatology : official journal of the California Perinatal Association,2019 04 25,To describe the clinical approach used by neonatologists for diagnosis of congenital/perinatal infections (CPI); no such data currently exist.,A combined gene expression tool for parallel histological prediction and gene fusion detection in non-small cell lung cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30914778,Scientific reports,2019 04 03,"Accurate histological classification and identification of fusion genes represent two cornerstones of clinical diagnostics in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Here, we present a NanoString gene expression platform and a novel platform-independent, single sample predictor (SSP) of NSCLC histology for combined, simultaneous, histological classification and fusion gene detection in minimal formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue. The SSP was developed in 68 NSCLC tumors of adenocarcinoma (AC), squamous cell carcinoma (SqCC) and large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC) histology, based on NanoString expression of 11 (CHGA, SYP, CD56, SFTPG, NAPSA, TTF-1, TP73L, KRT6A, KRT5, KRT40, KRT16) relevant genes for IHC-based NSCLC histology classification. The SSP was combined with a gene fusion detection module (analyzing ALK, RET, ROS1, MET, NRG1, and NTRK1) into a multicomponent NanoString assay. The histological SSP was validated in six cohorts varying in size (n = 11-199), tissue origin (early or advanced disease), histological composition (including undifferentiated cancer), and gene expression platform. Fusion gene detection revealed five EML4-ALK fusions, four KIF5B-RET fusions, two CD74-NRG1 fusion and three MET exon 14 skipping events among 131 tested cases. The histological SSP was successfully trained and tested in the development cohort (mean AUC = 0.96 in iterated test sets). The SSP proved successful in predicting histology of NSCLC tumors of well-defined subgroups and difficult undifferentiated morphology irrespective of gene expression data platform. Discrepancies between gene expression prediction and histologic diagnosis included cases with mixed histologies, true large cell carcinomas, or poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas with mucin expression. In summary, we present a proof-of-concept multicomponent assay for parallel histological classification and multiplexed fusion gene detection in archival tissue, including a novel platform-independent histological SSP classifier. The assay and SSP could serve as a promising complement in the routine evaluation of diagnostic lung cancer biopsies.",Long-term seasonal and interannual variability of marine aerobic anoxygenic photoheterotrophic bacteria.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30914777,The ISME journal,2019 03 27,"We studied the long-term temporal dynamics of the aerobic anoxygenic phototrophic (AAP) bacteria, a relevant functional group in the coastal marine microbial food web, using high-throughput sequencing of the pufM gene coupled with multivariate, time series and co-occurrence analyses at the Blanes Bay Microbial Observatory (NW Mediterranean). Additionally, using metagenomics, we tested whether the used primers captured accurately the seasonality of the most relevant AAP groups. Phylogroup K (Gammaproteobacteria) was the greatest contributor to community structure over all seasons, with phylogroups E and G (Alphaproteobacteria) being prevalent in spring. Diversity indices showed a clear seasonal trend, with maximum values in winter, which was inverse to that of AAP abundance. Multivariate analyses revealed sample clustering by season, with a relevant proportion of the variance explained by day length, temperature, salinity, phototrophic nanoflagellate abundance, chlorophyll a, and silicate concentration. Time series analysis showed robust rhythmic patterns of co-occurrence, but distinct seasonal behaviors within the same phylogroup, and even within different amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) conforming the same operational taxonomic unit (OTU). Altogether, our results picture the AAP assemblage as highly seasonal and recurrent but containing ecotypes showing distinctive temporal niche partitioning, rather than being a cohesive functional group.",Activin A regulates the epidermal growth factor receptor promoter by activating the PI3K/SP1 pathway in oral squamous cell carcinoma cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30914776,Scientific reports,2019 04 03,"Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and activin A are both overexpressed in oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). We evaluated their clinical correlation and activin A-mediated EGFR regulation in this study. Overexpression of both transcripts/proteins indicated a poorer prognosis in OSCC patients. Knockdown of endogenous INHBA repressed the expression of EGFR and inhibited activin A-mediated canonical Smads, noncanonical phosphorylation of AKT (ser473) (p-AKT ser473) and SP1. Inhibition of PI3K signaling via its inhibitor attenuated p-AKT ser473 and in turn reduced SP1 and EGFR expression in the presence of recombinant activin A (rActivin A) in OSCC cells, as revealed via a luciferase assay and western blotting. However, canonical Smad signaling repressed the EGFR promoter, as revealed by a luciferase assay. The transcription factor SP1, its coactivator CBP/p300, and Smad proteins were recruited to the EGFR proximal promoter following rActivin A treatment, as revealed by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). Smad2/3/4 dramatically outcompeted SP1 binding to the EGFR proximal promoter following mithramycin A treatment. Activin A activates the PI3K and Smad pathways to compete for binding to overlapping SP1 consensus sequences on the EGFR proximal promoter. Nevertheless, canonical p-Smad2 was largely repressed in OSCC tumor tissues, suggesting that the activin A-mediated noncanonical pathway is essential for the carcinogenesis of OSCC.",Keggin-type polyoxotungstates as mushroom tyrosinase inhibitors - A speciation study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30914775,Scientific reports,2019 04 03,"Mushroom tyrosinase abPPO4 is a commercially relevant polyphenol oxidase and has been being targeted for numerous inhibition studies including polyoxometalates (POMs). In the present work, its diphenolase activity was inhibited at pH 6.8 by a series of structurally related polyoxotungstates (POTs) of the α-Keggin archetype, exhibiting the general formula [Xn+W12O40](8-n)- in order to elucidate charge-dependent activity correlations. Kinetic data were obtained from the dopachrome assay and 183W NMR was applied to obtain crucial insights into the actual Keggin POT speciation in solution, facilitating a straightforward assignment of inhibition effects to the identified POT species. While [PW12O40]3- was completely hydrolyzed to its moderately active lacunary form Hx[PW11O39](7-x)- (Ki = 25.6 mM), [SiW12O40]4- showed the most pronounced inhibition effects with a Ki of 4.7 mM despite of partial hydrolysis to its ineffective lacunary form Hx[SiW11O39](8-x)-. More negative Keggin cluster charges of 5- and 6- generally resulted in preclusion of inhibitory efficacy as well as hydrolysis, but with the Ni-substituted cluster [PW11O39{Ni(H2O)}]5- enzymatic inhibition was clearly restored (Ki = 9.7 mM). The inhibitory capacity of the structurally intact Keggin POTs was found to be inversely correlated to their net charge. The here applied speciation strategy is of utmost importance for any biological POM application to identify the actually active POM species.",Octacosanol and policosanol prevent high-fat diet-induced obesity and metabolic disorders by activating brown adipose tissue and improving liver metabolism.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30914769,Scientific reports,2019 04 04,"Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is an attractive therapeutic target for treating obesity and metabolic diseases. Octacosanol is the main component of policosanol, a mixture of very long chain aliphatic alcohols obtained from plants. The current study aimed to investigate the effect of octacosanol and policosanol on high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity. Mice were fed on chow, or HFD, with or without octacosanol or policosanol treatment for four weeks. HFD-fed mice showed significantly higher body weight and body fat compared with chow-fed mice. However, mice fed on HFD treated with octacosanol or policosanol (HFDo/p) showed lower body weight gain, body fat gain, insulin resistance and hepatic lipid content. Lower body fat gain after octacosanol or policosanol was associated with increased BAT activity, reduced expression of genes involved in lipogenesis and cholesterol uptake in the liver, and amelioration of white adipose tissue (WAT) inflammation. Moreover, octacosanol and policosanol significantly increased the expression of Ffar4, a gene encoding polyunsaturated fatty acid receptor, which activates BAT thermogenesis. Together, these results suggest that octacosanol and policosanol ameliorate diet-induced obesity and metabolic disorders by increasing BAT activity and improving hepatic lipid metabolism. Thus, these lipids represent promising therapeutic targets for the prevention and treatment of obesity and obesity-related metabolic disorders."

The complexity and multistage process of urine excretion along with the obligatory use of PMCA raise the issue of whether strain characteristics of the PrPD present in vCJD brains, such as infectivity and phenotype determination, are maintained in urine excreted PrPD and following amplification by PMCA. We inoculated transgenic mice expressing normal human PrP with amplified urine and brain homogenate achieving the same 100% attack rate, similar incubation periods (in both cases extremely long) and histopathological features as for type and severity of the lesions. Furthermore, PrPD characteristics analyzed by immunoblot and conformational stability immunoassay were indistinguishable. Inoculation of raw vCJD urine caused no disease, confirming the extremely low concentration of PrPD in vCJD urine. These findings show that strain characteristics of vCJD brain PrPD, including infectivity, are preserved in PrPD present in urine and are faithfully amplified by means of PMCA; moreover, they suggest that the PrPD urine test might allow for the diagnosis and identification of disease subtype also in sporadic CJD.",Bromeliaceae subfamilies show divergent trends of genome size evolution.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30914753,Scientific reports,2019 04 03,"Genome size is known to vary widely across plants. Yet, the evolutionary drivers and consequences of genome size variation across organisms are far from understood. We investigated genome size variation and evolution in two major subfamilies of the Neotropical family Bromeliaceae by determining new genome size values for 83 species, testing phylogenetic signal in genome size variation, and assessing the fit to different evolutionary models. For a subset of epiphytic bromeliad species, we also evaluated the relationship of genome size with thermal traits and relative growth rate (RGR), respectively. Genome size variation in Bromelioideae appears to be evolutionary conserved, while genome size among Tillandsioideae varies considerably, not just due to polyploidy but arguably also due to environmental factors. The subfamilies show fundamental differences in genome size and RGR: Bromelioideae have, on average, lower genome sizes than Tillandsioideae and at the same time exhibit higher RGR. We attribute this to different resource use strategies in the subfamilies. Analyses among subfamilies, however, revealed unexpected positive relationships between RGR and genome size, which might be explained by the nutrient regime during cultivation. Future research should test whether there is indeed a trade-off between genome size and growth efficiency as a function of nutrient supply.",Nest microclimate during incubation affects posthatching development and parental care in wild birds.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30914752,Scientific reports,2019 04 03,"It is widely accepted that recent increases in environmental temperature have had a causal effect on changing life histories; however, much of the evidence for this is derived from long-term observations, whereas inferences of causation require experimentation. Here, we assess effects of increased environmental temperature during incubation on posthatching development, nestling begging and parental care, and reproductive success in two wild, cavity-nesting songbirds, the Carolina wren and prothonotary warbler. We heated experimental nests only during incubation, which increased nest-cavity temperature by ca. 1 °C. This reduced the length of the incubation and nestling periods, and reduced fledging success in prothonotary warblers, while nestling Carolina wrens had similar fledging success but reduced body condition in response to increased temperature. Increased nest-cavity temperature during incubation also reduced posthatching begging by nestlings generally and parental care within Carolina wrens specifically, suggesting potential mechanisms generating these carry-over effects. Offspring body mass and fledging age are often predictive of post-fledging survival and recruitment. Thus, our results suggest that increasing temperatures may affect fitness in wild populations in species-specific ways, and induce life-history changes including the classic trade-off parents face between the size and number of offspring.",A High Energy Density Azobenzene/Graphene Oxide Hybrid with Weak Nonbonding Interactions for Solar Thermal Storage.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30914751,Scientific reports,2019 04 03,"Incorporating photochromic chromophores into polymer composites provides the possibility of a reversible photoswitch of the intrinsic properties of these materials. In this paper we report a route to attach azobenzene (AZO) moiety covalently to graphene oxide (GO) to create chromophore/graphene oxide (AZO-GO) hybrid, in which GO is both part of the chromophore and the template. Due to the high grafting density of AZO moiety and the low mass of the novel structure, the hybrid is a potential solar thermal storage material with high energy density of about 240 Wh·kg-1. It is found that C-H···π interaction between the cis-AZO chromophores and the aromatic rings of the substrate induces collective electronic modifications of GO at critical percentage of cis-isomers and reduce the thermal barrier of π-π* transition of the chromophores directly, which results in two sections of first-order reactions during the photoisomerization of trans- to cis-hybrid and also thermally stabilizes the cis-hybrid. Our findings demonstrate that high-performance AZO-GO hybrid can be manipulated by optimizing intermolecular nonbonding interactions.",Utilization of NGS technologies to investigate transcriptomic and epigenomic mechanisms in trastuzumab resistance.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30914750,Scientific reports,2019 04 04,"NGS (Next Generation Sequencing) technologies allows us to determine key gene expression signatures that correlate with resistance (and responsiveness) to anti-cancer therapeutics. We have undertaken a transcriptomic and chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) approach to describe differences in gene expression and the underlying chromatin landscape between two representative HER2+ cell lines, one of which is sensitive (SKBR3) and the other which is resistant (JIMT1) to trastuzumab. We identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and differentially expressed transcripts (DETs) between SKBR3 and JIMT1 cells. Several of the DEGs are components of the Polycomb Repressing Complex 2 (PRC2), and they are expressed higher in JIMT1 cells. In addition, we utilized ChIP-seq to identify H3K18ac, H3K27ac and H3K27me3 histone modifications genome-wide. We identified key differences of H3K18ac and H3K27ac enrichment in regulatory regions, found a correlation between these modifications and differential gene expression and identified a transcription factor binding motif for LRF near these modifications in both cell lines. Lastly, we found a small subset of genes that contain repressive H3K27me3 marks near the gene body in SKBR3 cells but are absent in JIMT1. Taken together, our data suggests that differential gene expression and trastuzumab responsiveness in JIMT1 and SKBR3 is determined by epigenetic mechanisms.",Reconstruction of Dynamic and Reversible Color Change using Reflectin Protein.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30914749,Scientific reports,2019 04 03,"Cephalopods have remarkable ability to change their body color across a wide range of wavelengths, yet the structural basis remains largely unknown. Reflectin, a protein family assumed to be responsible for structural color in cephalopods, has unique features of higher-order assembly that are tightly regulated by aromatic molecules. Here, we reconstructed the dynamic and reversible color change using purified reflectin protein and demonstrated how the conformational change and the status of assembly led to the change in optical properties. In addition, optical spectral and structural analyses indicated that the ""cephalopod-blue"" primarily resulted from wavelength-dependent light scattering rather than reflection. Our results suggest a possible role of reflectin in color dynamics. The in vitro reconstruction system we present here may serve as an initial step for designing bio-inspired optical materials based on reflectin protein.",Cognitive correlates of abnormal myelination in psychosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30914748,Scientific reports,2019 04 04,"Psychotic illness has consistently been associated with deficits in cognitive function and reduced white matter integrity in the brain. However, the link between white matter disruptions and deficits in cognitive domains remains poorly understood. We assessed cognitive performance and white matter myelin water fraction (MWF) using multicomponent driven equilibrium single pulse observation of T1 and T2 (mcDESPOT) in recent-onset psychosis patients and age-matched healthy controls (HC). Psychosis patients showed deficits in working memory, phonological and semantic fluency, general intelligence quotient and reduced MWF in the left temporal white matter compared to HC. MWF in the left inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus and inferior longitudinal fasciculus was positively associated with intelligence quotient and verbal fluency in patients, and fully mediated group differences in performance in both phonological and semantic verbal fluency. There was no association between working memory and MWF in the left temporal white matter. Negative symptoms demonstrated a negative association with MWF within the left inferior and superior longitudinal fasciculi. These findings indicate that psychosis-related deficits in distinct cognitive domains, such as verbal fluency and working memory, are not underpinned by a single common dysfunction in white matter connectivity.",Quality and bias of protein disorder predictors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30914747,Scientific reports,2019 04 04,"Disorder in proteins is vital for biological function, yet it is challenging to characterize. Therefore, methods for predicting protein disorder from sequence are fundamental. Currently, predictors are trained and evaluated using data from X-ray structures or from various biochemical or spectroscopic data. However, the prediction accuracy of disordered predictors is not calibrated, nor is it established whether predictors are intrinsically biased towards one of the extremes of the order-disorder axis. We therefore generated and validated a comprehensive experimental benchmarking set of site-specific and continuous disorder, using deposited NMR chemical shift data. This novel experimental data collection is fully appropriate and represents the full spectrum of disorder. We subsequently analyzed the performance of 26 widely-used disorder prediction methods and found that these vary noticeably. At the same time, a distinct bias for over-predicting order was identified for some algorithms. Our analysis has important implications for the validity and the interpretation of protein disorder, as utilized, for example, in assessing the content of disorder in proteomes.",Familiarization with treadmill walking: How much is enough?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30914746,Scientific reports,2019 04 04,"Treadmill-based gait analysis is widely used to investigate walking pathologies and quantify treatment effects on locomotion. Differential sensorimotor conditions during overground vs. treadmill walking necessitate initial familiarization to treadmill walking. Currently, there is no standardized treadmill acclimatization protocol and insufficient familiarization potentially confounds analyses. We monitored initial adaptations to treadmill walking in 40 healthy adults. Twenty-six walking parameters were assessed over 10 minutes with marker-based kinematic analysis and acclimatization profiles were generated. While 16 walking parameters demonstrated initial acclimatization followed by plateau performance, ten parameters remained stable. Distal lower limb control including ankle range of motion, toe trajectory and foot clearance underwent substantial adaptations. Moreover, intralimb coordination and gait variability also demonstrated acclimatization, while measures of symmetry and interlimb coordination did not. All parameters exhibiting a plateau after acclimatization did so within 6-7 minutes (425 strides). Older participants and those naïve to treadmill walking showed adaptations with higher amplitudes but over similar timescales. Our results suggest a minimum of 6 minutes treadmill acclimatization is required to reach a stable performance, and that this should suffice for both older and naïve healthy adults. The presented data aids in optimizing treadmill-based gait analysis and contributes to improving locomotor assessments in research and clinical settings.",Perception of action-outcomes is shaped by life-long and contextual expectations.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30914745,Scientific reports,2019 04 03,"The way humans perceive the outcomes of their actions is strongly colored by their expectations. These expectations can develop over different timescales and are not always complementary. The present work examines how long-term (structural) expectations - developed over a lifetime - and short-term (contextual) expectations jointly affect perception. In two studies, including a pre-registered replication, participants initiated the movement of an ambiguously rotating sphere by operating a rotary switch. In the absence of any learning, participants predominantly perceived the sphere to rotate in the same direction as their rotary action. This bias toward structural expectations was abolished (but not reversed) when participants were exposed to incompatible action-effect contingencies (e.g., clockwise actions causing counterclockwise percepts) during a preceding learning phase. Exposure to compatible action-effect contingencies, however, did not add to the existing structural bias. Together, these findings reveal that perception of action-outcomes results from the combined influence of both long-term and immediate expectations."

For low resolution studies using techniques such as small-angle neutron scattering and neutron reflection, the level of deuteration of a sample can be varied to match the scattering length density of a specific D2O/H2O solvent mixture. This can be of major value in structural studies where specific regions of a complex system can be highlighted, and others rendered invisible. This is especially useful in analyses of the structure and dynamics of membrane components. In mammalian membranes, the presence of cholesterol is crucial in modulating the properties of lipids and in their interaction with proteins. Here, a protocol is described for the production of partially deuterated cholesterol which has a neutron scattering length density that matches that of 100% D2O solvent (hereby named matchout cholesterol). The level of deuteration was determined by mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance. The cholesterol match-point was verified experimentally using small angle neutron scattering. The matchout cholesterol was used to investigate the incorporation of cholesterol in various phosphatidylcholine supported lipid bilayers by neutron reflectometry. The study included both saturated and unsaturated lipids, as well as lipids with varying chain lengths. It was found that cholesterol is distributed asymmetrically within the bilayer, positioned closer to the headgroups of the lipids than to the middle of the tail core, regardless of the phosphatidylcholine species.",CCL21/CCR7 axis regulating juvenile cartilage repair can enhance cartilage healing in adults.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30914733,Scientific reports,2019 04 03,"Juvenile tissue healing is capable of extensive scarless healing that is distinct from the scar-forming process of the adult healing response. Although many growth factors can be found in the juvenile healing process, the molecular mechanisms of juvenile tissue healing are poorly understood. Here we show that juvenile mice deficient in the chemokine receptor CCR7 exhibit diminished large-scale healing potential, whereas CCR7-depleted adult mice undergo normal scar-forming healing similar to wild type mice. In addition, the CCR7 ligand CCL21 was transiently expressed around damaged cartilage in juvenile mice, whereas it is rarely expressed in adults. Notably, exogenous CCL21 administration to adults decreased scar-forming healing and enhanced hyaline-cartilage repair in rabbit osteochondral defects. Our data indicate that the CCL21/CCR7 axis may play a role in the molecular control mechanism of juvenile cartilage repair, raising the possibility that agents modulating the production of CCL21 in vivo can improve the quality of cartilage repair in adults. Such a strategy may prevent post-traumatic arthritis by mimicking the self-repair in juvenile individuals.",Effect of oestrogen-dependent vasopressin on HPA axis in the median eminence of female rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30914732,Scientific reports,2019 04 03,"The median eminence (ME) anatomically consists of external (eME) and internal (iME) layers. The hypothalamic neurosecretory cells terminate their axons in the eME and secrete their neurohormones regulating anterior pituitary hormone secretion involved in stress responses into the portal vein located in the eME. Magnocellular neurosecretory cells (MNCs) which produce arginine vasopressin (AVP) and oxytocin in the paraventricular (PVN) and supraoptic nuclei (SON) terminate their axons in the posterior pituitary gland (PP) through the iME. Here, we provide the first evidence that oestrogen modulates the dynamic changes in AVP levels in the eME axon terminals in female rats, using AVP-eGFP and AVP-DREADDs transgenic rats. Strong AVP-eGFP fluorescence in the eME was observed at all oestrus cycle stages in adult female rats but not in male transgenic rats. AVP-eGFP fluorescence in the eME was depleted after bilateral ovariectomy but re-appeared with high-dose 17β-oestradiol. AVP-eGFP fluorescence in the MNCs and PP did not change significantly in most treatments. Peripheral clozapine-N-oxide administration induced AVP-DREADDs neurone activation, causing a significant increase in plasma corticosterone levels in the transgenic rats. These results suggest that stress-induced activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis may be caused by oestrogen-dependent upregulation of AVP in the eME of female rats.",Causal relationship between local field potential and intrinsic optical signal in epileptiform activity in vitro.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30914731,Scientific reports,2019 04 04,"The directed causal relationship were examined between the local field potential (LFP) and the intrinsic optical signal (IOS) during induced epileptiform activity in in vitro cortical slices by the convergent cross-mapping causality analysis method. Two components of the IOS signal have been distinguished: a faster, activity dependent component (IOSh) which changes its sign between transmitted and reflected measurement, thus it is related to the reflectance or the scattering of the tissue and a slower component (IOSl), which is negative in both cases, thus it is resulted by the increase of the absorption of the tissue. We have found a strong, unidirectional, delayed causal effect from LFP to IOSh with 0.5-1s delay, without signs of feedback from the IOSh to the LFP, while the correlation was small and the peaks of the cross correlation function did not reflect the actual causal dependency. Based on these observations, a model has been set up to describe the dependency of the IOSh on the LFP power and IOSh was reconstructed, based on the LFP signal. This study demonstrates that causality analysis can lead to better understanding the physiological interactions, even in case of two data series with drastically different time scales.",Novel diversity within marine Mamiellophyceae (Chlorophyta) unveiled by metabarcoding.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30914730,Scientific reports,2019 04 04,"Mamiellophyceae (unicellular green algae) are a key phytoplankton group in coastal waters. Although extensively studied over the last 20 years, the overall oceanic distribution of the major species/clades is still poorly known. To address this problem, we analyzed the 2014 Ocean Sampling Day (OSD) metabarcoding dataset providing sequences from the V4 hypervariable region of the 18S rRNA gene for 157 samples collected at 143 mostly coastal stations. Mamiellophyceae were found at nearly all OSD stations and represented 55% of the green microalgae (Chlorophyta) reads. We performed phylogenetic analyses of unique OSD metabarcodes (amplicon single variants, ASVs) and GenBank reference sequences from cultures and from the environment, focusing on the four most represented genera: Ostreococcus (45% of the Mamiellophyceae reads), Micromonas (34%), Bathycoccus (10%) and Mantoniella (8.7%). These analyses uncovered novel diversity within each genus except Bathycoccus. In Ostreococcus, a new clade (E) was the second most represented clade after Ostreococcus ""lucimarinus"". Micromonas could be separated into nine clades, exceeding the six species and candidate species already described. Finally, we found two new environmental clades within Mantoniella. Each Mamiellophyceae clade had a specific distribution in the OSD dataset suggesting that they are adapted to different ecological niches.",Green synthesis of nitrogen-doped self-assembled porous carbon-metal oxide composite towards energy and environmental applications.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30914729,Scientific reports,2019 04 04,"Increasing environmental pollution, shortage of efficient energy conversion and storage devices and the depletion of fossil fuels have triggered the research community to look for advanced multifunctional materials suitable for different energy-related applications. Herein, we have discussed a novel and facile synthesis mechanism of such a carbon-based nanocomposite along with its energy and environmental applications. In this present work, nitrogen-doped carbon self-assembled into ordered mesoporous structure has been synthesized via an economical and environment-friendly route and its pore generating mechanism depending on the hydrogen bonding interaction has been highlighted. Incorporation of metal oxide nanoparticles in the porous carbon network has significantly improved CO2 adsorption and lithium storage capacity along with an improvement in the catalytic activity towards Oxygen Reduction Reaction (ORR). Thus our present study unveils a multifunctional material that can be used in three different fields without further modifications.",Characterization of putative DD-carboxypeptidase-encoding genes in Mycobacterium smegmatis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30914728,Scientific reports,2019 04 04,"Penicillin binding proteins (PBPs) are the target of numerous antimicrobial agents that disrupt bacterial cell wall synthesis. In mycobacteria, cell elongation occurs through insertion of nascent cell wall material in the sub-polar region, a process largely driven by High Molecular Weight PBPs. In contrast, the function of DD-carboxypeptidases (DD-CPases), which are Low Molecular Weight Class 1C PBPs, in mycobacteria remains poorly understood. Mycobacterium smegmatis encodes four putative DD-CPase homologues, which display homology to counterparts in Escherichia coli. Herein, we demonstrate that these are expressed in varying abundance during growth. Deletion of MSMEG_1661, MSMEG_2433 or MSMEG_2432, individually resulted in no defects in growth, cell morphology, drug susceptibility or spatial incorporation of new peptidoglycan. In contrast, deletion of MSMEG_6113 (dacB) was only possible in a merodiploid strain expressing the homologous M. tuberculosis operon encoding Rv3627c (dacB), Rv3626c, Rv3625c (mesJ) and Rv3624c (hpt), suggestive of essentiality. To investigate the role of this operon in mycobacterial growth, we depleted gene expression using anhydrotetracycline-responsive repressors and noted reduced bipolar peptidoglycan synthesis. These data point to a possible role for this four gene operon, which is highly conserved across all mycobacterial species, in regulating spatial localization of peptidoglycan synthesis.",Mitochondria transfer from mesenchymal stem cells structurally and functionally repairs renal proximal tubular epithelial cells in diabetic nephropathy in vivo.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30914727,Scientific reports,2019 04 04,"The underlying therapeutic mechanism of renal tubular epithelium repair of diabetic nephropathy (DN) by bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) has not been fully elucidated. Recently, mitochondria (Mt) transfer was reported as a novel action of BM-MSCs to rescue injured cells. We investigated Mt transfer from systemically administered BM-MSCs to renal proximal tubular epithelial cells (PTECs) in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic animals. BM-MSCs also transferred their Mt to impaired PTECs when co-cultured in vitro, which suppressed apoptosis of impaired PTECs. Additionally, BM-MSC-derived isolated Mt enhanced the expression of mitochondrial superoxide dismutase 2 and Bcl-2 expression and inhibited reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in vitro. Isolated Mt also inhibited nuclear translocation of PGC-1α and restored the expression of megalin and SGLT2 under high glucose condition (HG) in PTECs. Moreover, isolated Mt directly injected under the renal capsule of STZ rats improved the cellular morphology of STZ-PTECs, and the structure of the tubular basement membrane and brush border in vivo. This study is the first to show Mt transfer from systemically administered BM-MSCs to damaged PTECs in vivo, and the first to investigate mechanisms underlying the potential therapeutic effects of Mt transfer from BM-MSCs in DN.",Low Lattice Thermal Conductivity of a Two-Dimensional Phosphorene Oxide.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30914726,Scientific reports,2019 04 04,"A fundamental understanding of the phonon transport mechanism is important for optimizing the efficiency of thermoelectric devices. In this study, we investigate the thermal transport properties of the oxidized form of phosphorene called phosphorene oxide (PO) by solving phonon Boltzmann transport equation based on first-principles density functional theory. We reveal that PO exhibits a much lower thermal conductivity (2.42-7.08 W/mK at 300 K) than its pristine counterpart as well as other two-dimensional materials. To comprehend the physical origin of such low thermal conductivity, we scrutinize the contribution of each phonon branch to the thermal conductivity by evaluating various mode-dependent quantities including Grüneisen parameters, anharmonic three-phonon scattering rate, and phase space of three-phonon scattering processes. Our results show that its flexible puckered structure of PO leads to smaller sound velocities; its broken-mirror symmetry allows more ZA phonon scattering; and the relatively-free vibration of dangling oxygen atoms in PO gives rise to additional scattering resulting in further reduction in the phonon lifetime. These results can be verified by the fact that PO has larger phase space for three-phonon processes than phosphorene. Furthermore we show that the thermal conductivity of PO can be optimized by controlling its size or its phonon mean free path, indicating that PO can be a promising candidate for low-dimensional thermoelectric devices.",Characteristics and homogeneity of N6-methylation in human genomes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30914725,Scientific reports,2019 04 06,"A novel DNA modification, N-6 methylated deoxyadenosine (m6dA), has recently been discovered in eukaryotic genomes. Despite its low abundance in eukaryotes, m6dA is implicated in human diseases such as cancer. It is therefore important to precisely identify and characterize m6dA in the human genome. Here, we identify m6dA sites at nucleotide level, in different human cells, genome wide. We compare m6dA features between distinct human cells and identify m6dA characteristics in human genomes. Our data demonstrates for the first time that despite low m6dA abundance, the m6dA mark does often occur consistently at the same genomic location within a given human cell type, demonstrating m6dA homogeneity. We further show, for the first time, higher levels of m6dA homogeneity within one chromosome. Most m6dA are found on a single chromosome from a diploid sample, suggesting inheritance. Our transcriptome analysis not only indicates that human genes with m6dA are associated with higher RNA transcript levels but identifies allele-specific gene transcripts showing haplotype-specific m6dA methylation, which are implicated in different biological functions. Our analyses demonstrate the precision and consistency by which the m6dA mark occurs within the human genome, suggesting that m6dA marks are precisely inherited in humans."

The synapses linking ventral hippocampal outputs to medium spiny neurons of the accumbens may be key sites for the formation and storage of associations between place or context and reward, both drug-related and natural. To assess this, we implanted rats with electrodes in the accumbens shell to record synaptic potentials evoked by electrical stimulation of the ventral hippocampus, as well as continuous local-field-potential activity. Rats then underwent morphine-induced (10 mg/kg) conditioned-place-preference training, followed by extinction. Morphine caused an acute increase in the slope and amplitude of accumbens evoked responses, but no long-term changes were evident after conditioning or extinction of the place preference, suggesting that the formation of this type of memory does not lead to a net change in synaptic strength in the ventral hippocampal output to the accumbens. However, analysis of the local field potential revealed a marked sensitization of theta- and high-gamma-frequency activity with repeated morphine administration. This phenomenon may be linked to the behavioral changes-such as psychomotor sensitization and the development of drug craving-that are associated with chronic use of addictive drugs.",Strain effect on orbital and magnetic structures of Mn ions in epitaxial Nd0.35Sr0.65MnO3/SrTiO3 films using X-ray diffraction and absorption.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30914713,Scientific reports,2019 04 04,"This study probes the temperature-dependent strain that is strongly correlated with the orbital and magnetic structures of epitaxial films of Nd0.35Sr0.65MnO3 (NSMO) that are fabricated by pulsed laser deposition with two thicknesses, 17 (NS17) and 103 nm (NS103) on SrTiO3 (STO) substrate. This investigation is probed using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and absorption-based techniques, X-ray linear dichroism (XLD) and the X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD). XRD indicates a significant shift in the (004) peak position that is associated with larger strain in NS17 relative to that of NS103 at both 30 and 300 K. Experimental and atomic multiplet simulated temperature-dependent Mn L3,2-edge XLD results reveal that the stronger strain in a thinner NS17 film causes less splitting of Mn 3d eg state at low temperature, indicating an enhancement of orbital fluctuations in the band above the Fermi level. This greater Mn 3d orbital fluctuation can be the cause of both the enhanced ferromagnetism (FM) as a result of spin moments and the reduced Néel temperature of C-type antiferromagnetism (AFM) in NS17, leading to the FM coupling of the canted-antiferromagnetism (FM-cAFM) state in NSMO/STO epitaxial films at low temperature (T = 30 K). These findings are also confirmed by Mn L3,2-edge XMCD measurements.",Melanocyte Chitosan/Gelatin Composite Fabrication with Human Outer Root Sheath-Derived Cells to Produce Pigment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30914712,Scientific reports,2019 04 06,"The hair follicle serves as a melanocyte reservoir for both hair and skin pigmentation. Melanocyte stem cells (MelSCs) and melanocyte progenitors reside in the bulge/sub-bulge region of the lower permanent portion of the hair follicle and play a vital role for repigmentation in vitiligo. It would be beneficial to isolate MelSCs in order to further study their function in pigmentary disorders; however, due to the lack of specific molecular surface markers, this has not yet been successfully accomplished in human hair follicles (HuHF). One potential method for MelSCs isolation is the ""side population"" technique, which is frequently used to isolate hematopoietic and tumor stem cells. In the present study, we decided to isolate HuHF MelSCs using ""side population"" to investigate their melanotic function. By analyzing mRNA expression of TYR, SOX10, and MITF, melanosome structure, and immunofluorescence with melanocyte-specific markers, we revealed that the SP-fraction contained MelSCs with an admixture of differentiated melanocytes. Furthermore, our in vivo studies indicated that differentiated SP-fraction cells, when fabricated into a cell-chitosan/gelatin composite, could transiently repopulate immunologically compromised mice skin to regain pigmentation. In summary, the SP technique is capable of isolating HuHF MelSCs that can potentially be used to repopulate skin for pigmentation.",Pancreatic stone protein/regenerating protein is a potential biomarker for endoplasmic reticulum stress in beta cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30914711,Scientific reports,2019 04 04,"Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in beta cells is an important pathogenic component of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus, as well as genetic forms of diabetes, especially Wolfram syndrome. However, there are currently no convenient ways to assess ER stress in beta cells, raising the need for circulating ER stress markers indicative of beta cell health. Here we show that pancreatic stone protein/regenerating protein (PSP/reg) is a potential biomarker for ER stressed beta cells. PSP/reg levels are elevated in cell culture and mouse models of Wolfram syndrome, a prototype of ER stress-induced diabetes. Moreover, PSP/reg expression is induced by the canonical chemical inducers of ER stress, tunicamycin and thapsigargin. Circulating PSP/reg levels are also increased in some patients with Wolfram syndrome. Our results therefore reveal PSP/reg as a potential biomarker for beta cells under chronic ER stress, as is the case in Wolfram syndrome.",Genetic structure in the paternal lineages of South East Spain revealed by the analysis of 17 Y-STRs.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30914710,Scientific reports,2019 04 04,"The genetic data of 17 Y chromosome short tandem repeats in 146 unrelated donor residents in the provinces of Granada, Málaga, and Almería (GMA) were analyzed to determine the genetic legacy of the male inhabitants of the former Kingdom of Granada. A total of 139 unique haplotypes were identified. Observed allele frequencies and haplogroup frequencies were also analyzed. By AMOVA and STRUCTURE analysis, the populations of the 3 provinces could be treated genetically as a single population. The most frequent haplogroup was R1b1b2 (58.22%). By network analysis of all individuals, we observed a distribution according to haplogroup assignment. To improve the characterization of GMA population, it was compared with those of North Africa, the Iberian Peninsula, and southern Europe. In our analysis of allele frequencies and genetic distances, the GMA population lay within the Spanish population group. Further, in the STRUCTURE analysis, there was no African component in the GMA population, confirming that, based on our genetic markers, the GMA population does not reflect any male genetic influence of the North African people. The presence of African haplogroups in the GMA population is irrelevant when their frequency is compared with those in other European populations.",Relationship of the orange tissue morphotype with shell and pearl colouration in the mollusc Pinctada margaritifera.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30914709,Scientific reports,2019 04 04,"Molluscs display a vast range of shell colours both between and within species. However, only a few species show colour variation in their soft tissues. In French Polynesia, the pearl oyster Pinctada margaritifera has three tissue morphotypes: the black wild-type and two rare mutations: white albino and orange mantle. Phenotypic transmission is known to occur from these phenotypes when they are used as graft donors for pearl production, leading to multicoloured and white pearls from black and albino mantle grafts, respectively. The present study furthers this knowledge by examining the phenotypic association between the orange mantle tissue morphotype and hard tissues: shells and cultured pearls. Based on a large experimental graft, shell colour quantification and pearl qualification showed that the orange morphotype is associated with light-coloured shells and pearls. Expression analysis of some candidate genes previously identified in the white mantle mutant, tested here on both graft and pearl sac tissues from orange mantle donors, confirmed the involvement of genes associated with shell matrix protein (shem4) and the melanin biosynthesis pathway (zinc). This study provides fundamental information on the mechanism behind mantle tissue colour in P. margaritifera and its association with biomineralisation and pigmentation processes that will be potentially valuable in future selection programs.",Mutational and non mutational adaptation of Salmonella enterica to the gall bladder.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30914708,Scientific reports,2019 04 03,"During systemic infection of susceptible hosts, Salmonella enterica colonizes the gall bladder, which contains lethal concentrations of bile salts. Recovery of Salmonella cells from the gall bladder of infected mice yields two types of isolates: (i) bile-resistant mutants; (ii) isolates that survive lethal selection without mutation. Bile-resistant mutants are recovered at frequencies high enough to suggest that increased mutation rates may occur in the gall bladder, thus providing a tentative example of stress-induced mutation in a natural environment. However, most bile-resistant mutants characterized in this study show defects in traits that are relevant for Salmonella colonization of the animal host. Mutation may thus permit short-term adaptation to the gall bladder at the expense of losing fitness for transmission to new hosts. In contrast, non mutational adaptation may have evolved as a fitness-preserving strategy. Failure of RpoS- mutants to colonize the gall bladder supports the involvement of the general stress response in non mutational adaptation.",Synergy between the alteration in the N-terminal region of butyrylcholinesterase K variant and apolipoprotein E4 in late-onset Alzheimer's disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30914707,Scientific reports,2019 04 03,"While the life expectancy of the population has increased, Alzheimer's disease (AD) has emerged as one of the greatest health problems of old age. AD is characterized by neuronal loss and cognitive decline. In the AD brain, there is a decrease in levels of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and an increase in the levels of the related enzyme butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), that accumulate in plaques and tangles. Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) is a major cholesterol carrier and plays an important role in maintaining lipid homeostasis. APOE-ε4 constitutes the most important known genetic risk factor for late-onset AD. It has been proposed that the BCHE-K allele (Ala539Thr) acts in synergy with the APOE-ε4 allele to promote risk for AD. However, there is insufficient evidence to support a correlation. Most studies focused only on the coding regions of the genes. In this study, we analyzed sequence regions beyond the BCHE coding sequence. We found synergy between APOE-ε4 and SNPs localized in 5'UTR (rs1126680) and in intron 2 (rs55781031) of the BCHE-K allele (rs1803274) in 18% of patients with late-onset AD (n = 55). The results show that the coexistence of the APOE-ε4 allele and 3 SNPs in the BCHE gene is associated with a highly elevated risk of late-onset AD. SNP (rs1126680) in 5'UTR of the BCHE gene is located 32 nucleotides upstream of the 28 amino acid signal peptide. Mass spectrometry analysis of the BChE protein produced by SNP (rs1126680) showed that the mutation caused an in frame N-terminal extension of 41 amino acids of the BChE signal peptide. The resultant variant with a 69 amino acid signal peptide, designated N-BChE, may play a role in development of AD.",Identification and characterization of the lncRNA signature associated with overall survival in patients with neuroblastoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30914706,Scientific reports,2019 04 04,"Neuroblastoma (NB) is a commonly occurring cancer among infants and young children. Recently, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been using as prognostic biomarkers for therapeutics and interventions in various cancers. Considering the poor survival of NB, the lncRNA-based therapeutic strategies must be improved. This work proposes an overall survival time estimator called SVR-NB to identify the lncRNA signature that is associated with the overall survival of patients with NB. SVR-NB is an optimized support vector regression (SVR)-based method that uses an inheritable bi-objective combinatorial genetic algorithm for feature selection. The dataset of 231 NB patients that contains overall survival information and expression profiles of 783 lncRNAs was used to design and evaluate SVR-NB from the database of gene expression omnibus accession GSE62564. SVR-NB identified a signature of 35 lncRNAs and achieved a mean squared correlation coefficient of 0.85 and a mean absolute error of 0.56 year between the actual and estimated overall survival time using 10-fold cross-validation. Further, we ranked and characterized the 35 lncRNAs according to their contribution towards the estimation accuracy. Functional annotations and co-expression gene analysis of LOC440896, LINC00632, and IGF2-AS revealed the association of co-expressed genes in Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways.",The physiology of forager hydration and variation among harvester ant (Pogonomyrmex barbatus) colonies in collective foraging behavior.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30914705,Scientific reports,2019 04 04,"Ants are abundant in desiccating environments despite their high surface area to volume ratios and exposure to harsh conditions outside the nest. Red harvester ant (Pogonomyrmex barbatus) colonies must spend water to obtain water: colonies lose water as workers forage outside the nest, and gain water metabolically through seeds collected in foraging trips. Here we present field experiments showing that hydrated P. barbatus foragers made more foraging trips than unhydrated nestmates. The positive effect of hydration on foraging activity is stronger as the risk of desiccation increases. Desiccation tests showed that foragers of colonies that reduce foraging in dry conditions are more sensitive to water loss, losing water and motor coordination more rapidly in desiccating conditions, than foragers of colonies that do not reduce foraging in dry conditions. Desiccation tolerance is also associated with colony reproductive success. Surprisingly, foragers that are more sensitive to water loss are from colonies more likely to produce offspring colonies. This could be because the foragers of these colonies conserve water with a more cautious response to desiccation risk. An ant's hydration status may influence its response to the olfactory interactions that regulate its decision to leave the nest to forage. Thus variation among ant colonies in worker physiology and response to ambient conditions may contribute to ecologically significant differences among colonies in collective behavior."

To assess the efficacy of perioperative administration of landiolol hydrochloride, an intravenous beta-blocker, for lung cancer, we conducted a single-center, retrospective study. This study included patients who participated in a research conducted by Nippon Medical School Hospital from August 2012 to November 2013. The main selection criteria were males and females younger than 85 years old who have undergone anatomic lung resection for lung malignancies. Fifty-seven patients, 28 in the landiolol group and 29 in the control group, were included. The postoperative relapse-free survival rate at 2 years was 0.89 (95% CI, 0.78-1.01) in the landiolol group and 0.76 (95% CI, 0.60-0.91) in the control group (Chi-squared test; P = 0.1828). The relapse-free survival rate tended to be higher in the landiolol group than in the control. Hazard ratio for relapse-free survival in the landiolol group compared to the control was 0.41 (95% CI, 0.13-1.34), demonstrating that relapse free survival was prolonged in the landiolol group (log-rank test; P = 0.1294). It was suggested that relapse-free survival was prolonged when landiolol hydrochloride was administered from the induction to completion of anesthesia. Further studies are needed to confirm our findings.",Parasite detection in the ornamental fish trade using environmental DNA.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30914693,Scientific reports,2019 04 04,"Effective border control relies on stringent biosecurity protocols to detect and prevent introductions of exotic pests and diseases. Detection of pathogens and parasites in the live ornamental fish trade using environmental DNA (eDNA) techniques has the potential to improve current biosecurity practices. We examined water samples from 11 target consignments (cyprinids susceptible to Dactylogyrus spp. infections) and seven non-target fish consignments (non-cyprinids, not susceptible to Dactylogyrus spp. infections) imported from Southeast Asia to Australia for the presence of eDNA from five Dactylogyrus species (Monogenea: Dactylogyridae). A four-step predictive framework was used to predict putative positive and putative negative detections from quantitative PCR assays. Both target and non-target consignments were positive for Dactylogyrus spp. eDNA as confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Positive detections for Dactylogyrus spp. eDNA in non-target fish consignments demonstrates the possibility of source water contamination, limiting the applicability of eDNA screening methods at border control. This study suggests that screening for parasite eDNA within ornamental fish consignments should be tested during pre-export quarantine periods to avoid false positive detections at border control. Lastly, the proposed predictive framework has a broad utility for minimizing false positive and false negative eDNA detections of aquatic organisms.",High glucose level and angiotensin II type 1 receptor stimulation synergistically amplify oxidative stress in renal mesangial cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30914692,Scientific reports,2019 04 03,"Oxidative stress in renal mesangial cell causes diabetic glomerular changes. High glucose levels and angiotensin II (Ang II) are known to stimulate superoxide production in renal mesangial cells. However, it has been unclear whether Ang II stimulation and pre-conditioning with high glucose affects the same pathway of superoxide production in renal mesangial cells or not. In this study, we examined the levels of oxidative stress under Ang II stimulation in renal mesangial cells preincubated for six hours at various glucose levels. Intracellular levels of reactive oxidative species (ROS) were measured using dihydroethidium or 5',6'-chloromethyl- 2',7' dichlorodihydro-fluorescein diacetate, which facilitates the detection of intracellular ROS under real-time fluorescent microscope. Ang II-induced elevated intracellular ROS levels were detected only when the cells were pre-incubated with high levels of glucose (13.5 mM, 27.8 mM), but was not detected under normal glucose condition (5.5 mM). Production of Ang II-induced intracellular ROS was higher under pre-treatment with 27.8 mM glucose compared to pretreatment with 13.5 mM glucose level. This ROS production in mesangial cells was induced within several minutes of the initiation of Ang II stimulation under high glucose levels. The production of intracellular ROS was significantly reduced in the presence of angiotensin II type1-receptor (AT1R) antagonist, whereas it was augmented in the presence of angiotensin II type2-receptor antagonist. In conclusion, Ang II-induced oxidative stress was augmented by high glucose levels and ROS levels were further alleviated in the presence of AT1R antagonists.","Inhibition of IL-17 ameliorates systemic lupus erythematosus in Roquinsan/san mice through regulating the balance of TFH cells, GC B cells, Treg and Breg.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30914691,Scientific reports,2019 04 03,"Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is mediated by a chronic and dysregulated inflammatory response. Interleukin (IL)-17, a proinflammatory cytokine, and T helper (Th)17 cells are associated with chronic autoimmune diseases. We hypothesized that inhibition of IL-17 would decrease the numbers of T cell subsets that function as B-cell helpers, as well as B-cell differentiation into plasma cells and autoantibody expression. The IL-17 level was increased markedly in Roquinsan/san mice. Loss of IL-17 in Roquinsan/san mice improved nephritis by downregulating immunoglobulin (Ig)G, IgG1, and IgG2a production. Formation of germinal centers (GCs), and follicular B- and T-cell differentiation was reduced, whereas the number of regulatory T (Treg) cells and immature B cells was increased, by IL-17 deficiency in Roquinsan/san mice. These results suggest that IL-17 inhibition can ameliorate SLE by inhibiting B-cell differentiation into GCs. Therefore, IL-17-producing Th17 cells show promise as a target for development of novel therapeutics for SLE.",A Fully Automated System Using A Convolutional Neural Network to Predict Renal Allograft Rejection: Extra-validation with Giga-pixel Immunostained Slides.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30914690,Scientific reports,2019 04 03,"Pathologic diagnoses mainly depend on visual scoring by pathologists, a process that can be time-consuming, laborious, and susceptible to inter- and/or intra-observer variations. This study proposes a novel method to enhance pathologic scoring of renal allograft rejection. A fully automated system using a convolutional neural network (CNN) was developed to identify regions of interest (ROIs) and to detect C4d positive and negative peritubular capillaries (PTCs) in giga-pixel immunostained slides. The performance of faster R-CNN was evaluated using optimal parameters of the novel method to enlarge the size of labeled masks. Fifty and forty pixels of the enlarged size images showed the best performance in detecting C4d positive and negative PTCs, respectively. Additionally, the feasibility of deep-learning-assisted labeling as independent dataset to enhance detection in this model was evaluated. Based on these two CNN methods, a fully automated system for renal allograft rejection was developed.

To date, pathogenic 'Candidatus Liberibacter spp.' (CLs) remain uncultured, therefore the plant-associated Liberibacter crescens (Lcr), only cultured species of the genus, has been used as a biological model for in vitro studies. Biofilm formation by CLs has been observed on the outer midgut surface of insect vectors, but not in planta. However, the role of biofilm formation in the life cycle of these pathogens remains unclear. Here, a model system for studying CLs biofilms was developed using Lcr. By culture media modifications, bovine serum albumin (BSA) was identified as blocking initial cell-surface adhesion. Removal of BSA allowed for the first time observation of Lcr biofilms. After media optimization for biofilm formation, we demonstrated that Lcr attaches to surfaces, and form cell aggregates embedded in a polysaccharide matrix both in batch cultures and under flow conditions in microfluidic chambers. Biofilm structures may represent excellent adaptive advantages for CLs during insect vector colonization helping with host retention, immune system evasion, and transmission. Future studies using the Lcr model established here will help in the understanding of the biology of CLs.","Calcitonin native prefibrillar oligomers but not monomers induce membrane damage that triggers NMDA-mediated Ca2+-influx, LTP impairment and neurotoxicity.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30914688,Scientific reports,2019 04 04,"Amyloid protein misfolding results in a self-assembling aggregation process, characterized by the formation of typical aggregates. The attention is focused on pre-fibrillar oligomers (PFOs), formed in the early stages and supposed to be neurotoxic. PFOs structure may change due to their instability and different experimental protocols. Consequently, it is difficult to ascertain which aggregation species are actually neurotoxic. We used salmon Calcitonin (sCT) as an amyloid model whose slow aggregation rate allowed to prepare stable samples without photochemical cross-linking. Intracellular Ca2+ rise plays a fundamental role in amyloid protein-induced neurodegerations. Two paradigms have been explored: (i) the ""membrane permeabilization"" due to the formation of amyloid pores or other types of membrane damage; (ii) ""receptor-mediated"" modulation of Ca2+ channels. In the present paper, we tested the effects of native sCT PFOs- with respect to Monomer-enriched solutions in neurons characterized by an increasing degree of differentiation, in terms of -Ca2+-influx, cellular viability, -Long-Term Potentiation impairment, Post-Synaptic Densities and synaptophysin expression. Results indicated that PFOs-, but not Monomer-enriched solutions, induced abnormal -Ca2+-influx, which could only in part be ascribed to NMDAR activation. Thus, we propose an innovative neurotoxicity mechanism for amyloid proteins where ""membrane permeabilization"" and ""receptor-mediated"" paradigms coexist.",Physiological Association between Limb Ballistocardiogram and Arterial Blood Pressure Waveforms: A Mathematical Model-Based Analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30914687,Scientific reports,2019 04 03,"By virtue of its direct association with the cardiovascular (CV) functions and compatibility to unobtrusive measurement during daily activities, the limb ballistocardiogram (BCG) is receiving an increasing interest as a viable means for ultra-convenient CV health and disease monitoring. However, limited insights on its physical implications have hampered disciplined interpretation of the BCG and systematic development of the BCG-based approaches for CV health monitoring. In this study, a mathematical model that can predict the limb BCG in responses to the arterial blood pressure (BP) waves in the aorta was developed and experimentally validated. The validated mathematical model suggests that (i) the limb BCG waveform reveals the timings and amplitudes associated with the aortic BP waves; (ii) mechanical filtering exerted by the musculoskeletal properties of the body can obscure the manifestation of the arterial BP waves in the limb BCG; and (iii) the limb BCG exhibits meaningful morphological changes in response to the alterations in the CV risk predictors. The physical insights garnered by the analysis of the mathematical model may open up new opportunities toward next generation of the BCG-based CV healthcare techniques embedded with transparency, interpretability, and robustness against the external variability.",Friction factor for turbulent open channel flow covered by vegetation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30914686,Scientific reports,2019 04 03,"The need for operational models describing the friction factor f in streams remains undisputed given its utility across a plethora of hydrological and hydraulic applications concerned with shallow inertial flows. For small-scale roughness elements uniformly covering the wetted parameter of a wide channel, the Darcy-Weisbach f = 8(u*/Ub)2 is widely used at very high Reynolds numbers, where u* is friction velocity related to the surface kinematic stress, Ub = Q/A is bulk velocity, Q is flow rate, and A is cross-sectional area orthogonal to the flow direction. In natural streams, the presence of vegetation introduces additional complications to quantifying f, the subject of the present work. Turbulent flow through vegetation are characterized by a number of coherent vortical structures: (i) von Karman vortex streets in the lower layers of vegetated canopies, (ii) Kelvin-Helmholtz as well as attached eddies near the vegetation top, and (iii) attached eddies well above the vegetated layer. These vortical structures govern the canonical mixing lengths for momentum transfer and their influence on f is to be derived. The main novelty is that the friction factor of vegetated flow can be expressed as fv = 4Cd(Uv/Ub)2 where Uv is the spatially averaged velocity within the canopy volume, and Cd is a local drag coefficient per unit frontal area derived to include the aforemontioned layer-wise effects of vortical structures within and above the canopy along with key vegetation properties. The proposed expression is compared with a number of empirical relations derived for vegetation under emergent and submerged conditions as well as numerous data sets covering a wide range of canopy morphology, densities, and rigidity. It is envisaged that the proposed formulation be imminently employed in eco-hydraulics where the interaction between flow and vegetation is being sought.",Effect of Mechanical Stretch on the DNCB-induced Proinflammatory Cytokine Secretion in Human Keratinocytes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30914685,Scientific reports,2019 04 04,"Skin is exposed to various physico-chemical cues. Keratinocytes, a major component of the skin epidermis, directly interact with the surrounding extracellular matrix, and thus, biochemical and biophysical stimulations from the matrix regulate the function of keratinocytes. Although it was reported that inflammatory responses of skin were altered by an applied mechanical force, understanding how the keratinocytes sense the mechanical stimuli and regulate a cytokine secretion remains unclear. Here, we designed a device that is able to apply chemo-mechanical cues to keratinocytes and assess their proinflammatory cytokine IL-6 production. We showed that when chemical stimuli were applied with mechanical stimuli simultaneously, the IL-6 production markedly increased compared to that observed with a single stimulus. Quantitative structural analysis of cellular components revealed that the applied mechanical stretch transformed the cell morphology into an elongated shape, increased the cell size, and dictated the distribution of focal adhesion complex. Our results suggest that the mechanical cue-mediated modulation of focal adhesion proteins and actin cytoskeleton translates into intracellular signaling associated with the IL-6 production particularly in skin sensitization. Our study can be applied to understand proinflammatory responses of skin under altered biophysical environments of the skin."

Previous studies have demonstrated that effective connectivity, as assessed by transcranial magnetic stimulation combined with electroencephalography (TMS-EEG), breaks down during the loss of consciousness. This study investigated changes in EEG connectivity associated with consciousness during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep following parietal TMS. Compared with unconsciousness, conscious experiences during NREM sleep were associated with reduced phase-locking at low frequencies (<4 Hz). Transitivity and clustering coefficient in the delta and theta bands were also significantly lower during consciousness compared to unconsciousness, with differences in the clustering coefficient observed in scalp electrodes over parietal-occipital regions. There were no significant differences in Granger-causality patterns in frontal-to-parietal or parietal-to-frontal connectivity between reported unconsciousness and reported consciousness. Together these results suggest that alterations in spectral and spatial characteristics of network properties in posterior brain areas, in particular decreased local (segregated) connectivity at low frequencies, is a potential indicator of consciousness during sleep.",Suboptimal human multisensory cue combination.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30914673,Scientific reports,2019 04 04,"Information from different sensory modalities can interact, shaping what we think we have seen, heard, or otherwise perceived. Such interactions can enhance the precision of perceptual decisions, relative to those based on information from a single sensory modality. Several computational processes could account for such improvements. Slight improvements could arise if decisions are based on multiple independent sensory estimates, as opposed to just one. Still greater improvements could arise if initially independent estimates are summed to form a single integrated code. This hypothetical process has often been described as optimal when it results in bimodal performance consistent with a summation of unimodal estimates weighted in proportion to the precision of each initially independent sensory code. Here we examine cross-modal cue combination for audio-visual temporal rate and spatial location cues. While suggestive of a cross-modal encoding advantage, the degree of facilitation falls short of that predicted by a precision weighted summation process. These data accord with other published observations, and suggest that precision weighted combination is not a general property of human cross-modal perception.",Band Anti-Crossing Model in Dilute-As GaNAs Alloys.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30914672,Scientific reports,2019 04 04,"The band structure of the dilute-As GaNAs material is explained by the hybridization of localized As-impurity states with the valance band structure of GaN. Our approach employs the use of Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculated band structures, along with experimental results, to determine the localized As-impurity energy level and coupling parameters in the band anti-crossing (BAC) k ∙ p model for N-rich alloys. This model captures the reduction of bandgap with increasing arsenic incorporation and provides a tool for device-level design with the material within the context of the k ∙ p formalism. The analysis extends to calculating the effect of the arsenic impurities on hole (heavy, light and split-off) effective masses and predicting the trend of the bandgap across the entire composition range.",Dynamic interaction between basin redox and the biogeochemical nitrogen cycle in an unconventional Proterozoic petroleum system.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30914671,Scientific reports,2019 04 04,"Precambrian hydrocarbons and their corresponding source rocks are distinctly different from their Phanerozoic counterparts, having been deposited in persistently anoxic environments in ecosystems dominated by bacteria. Here, we show that cyclic enrichment of organic matter in the world's oldest hydrocarbon play (ca. 1.38 Ga), is not associated with flooding surfaces and is unrelated to variations in mineralogy or changes in the relative rate of clastic to biogenic sedimentation-factors typically attributed to organic enrichment in Phanerozoic shales. Instead, the cyclic covariation of total organic carbon, δ15N, δ13C and molybdenum are explained by the feedback between high levels of primary productivity, basin redox and the biogeochemical nitrogen cycle. These factors are important in constraining productivity in the marine biosphere, the development of Precambrian hydrocarbon source rocks, and more generally in understanding oxygenation of the ocean and atmosphere through Earth history; as all are ultimately related to organic carbon burial.",A plasmonic refractive index sensor with an ultrabroad dynamic sensing range.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30914670,Scientific reports,2019 04 04,"Refractive index sensors based on surface plasmon resonance (SPR) promise to deliver high sensitivities. However, these sensitivities depend on the derivative of the monitored SPR parameters near resonance, so this dependency leads to a relatively narrow detection range for refractive index changes. Herein, we introduce an idea to improve the detection range refractive index through a high-contrast-index curved waveguide surrounded with an outer gold ring. The proposed detection technique, based on the output power measurement of the curved waveguide, offers a linear response over an ultrabroad range of the refractive index for a surrounding medium from n = 1 to 2.36. Meanwhile, an theoretically ultrahigh refractive index resolution (RIU) of 4.53 × 10-10 could be accessible for such a broad testing range, available for both gas and aqueous chemical sample refractive indices Furthermore, the power detection approach enables an integrated photodetector for a lab-on-chip sensor platform, revealing a high potential for a multifunctional, compact, and highly sensitive sensor-on-chip device.",Utilizing general human movement models to predict the spread of emerging infectious diseases in resource poor settings.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30914669,Scientific reports,2019 04 06,"Human mobility is an important driver of geographic spread of infectious pathogens. Detailed information about human movements during outbreaks are, however, difficult to obtain and may not be available during future epidemics. The Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in West Africa between 2014-16 demonstrated how quickly pathogens can spread to large urban centers following one cross-species transmission event. Here we describe a flexible transmission model to test the utility of generalised human movement models in estimating EVD cases and spatial spread over the course of the outbreak. A transmission model that includes a general model of human mobility significantly improves prediction of EVD's incidence compared to models without this component. Human movement plays an important role not only to ignite the epidemic in locations previously disease free, but over the course of the entire epidemic. We also demonstrate important differences between countries in population mixing and the improved prediction attributable to movement metrics. Given their relative rareness, locally derived mobility data are unlikely to exist in advance of future epidemics or pandemics. Our findings show that transmission patterns derived from general human movement models can improve forecasts of spatio-temporal transmission patterns in places where local mobility data is unavailable.",Unveiling a Scaling and Universal Behavior for the Magnetocaloric Effect in Cubic Crystal Structures: A Monte Carlo Simulation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30914668,Scientific reports,2019 04 03,"The magnetocaloric effect and the universal character for the magnetic entropy change regarding the cubic crystal structures (SC, BCC, FCC) were investigated, in a qualitative way, using Monte Carlo simulations. A classical Heisenberg Hamiltonian with nearest neighbors, and next nearest neighbors interactions was implemented. In order to compute the critical temperature of the system depending on the coordination number, it was calculated the dependence of the magnetization and magnetic susceptibility as a function of temperature. Magnetic field dependence on the magnetization for isothermal processes was performed considering a magnetocrystalline anisotropy term. In this way, the magnetic entropy change (ΔSm) was computed. Results show that the rescaled ΔSm as well as the exponent (n) characterizing the field dependence of the magnetic entropy change curves, collapse onto a single curve for the studied crystal structures. By this reason, it can be assured that ΔSm exhibits a universal behavior regarding the strength and contribution of the magnetic exchange energy to the total magnetic energy.",Local-Field Corrections as a Regularization Method for the Spin-Boson Model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30914667,Scientific reports,2019 04 03,"The decoherence rate of a 'central spin' in a bosonic bath of magnetic fluctuations is computed using the spin-boson model. The magnetic fluctuations are treated in a fully quantum mechanical way by using the macroscopic quantum electrodynamics formalism and are expressed in terms of the classical electromagnetic Green's function of the system. The resulting frequency integral formally diverges but it can be regularized by applying real-cavity, local-field corrections to the location of the 'central spin'. This results in a cut-off function in terms of the magnetic permeability of the background material that leads to convergence at both high and low frequencies. This cut-off function appears naturally from the formalism and thus removes the need to rely on ad-hoc arguments to justify the form of the cut-off function. Furthermore, the magnetic permeability and the nature of interactions in quantum electrodynamics illuminate the connection between the two main models of 'central spin' decoherence, the spin-boson model and the spin-bath model, demonstrating how the two very different models are able to correctly model the same underlying physics.",Tunable Schottky barrier in graphene/graphene-like germanium carbide van der Waals heterostructure.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30914666,Scientific reports,2019 04 03,"The structural and electronic properties of van der Waals (vdW) heterostructrue constructed by graphene and graphene-like germanium carbide were investigated by computations based on density functional theory with vdW correction. The results showed that the Dirac cone in graphene can be quite well-preserved in the vdW heterostructure. The graphene/graphene-like germanium carbide interface forms a p-type Schottky contact. The p-type Schottky barrier height decreases as the interlayer distance decreases and finally the contact transforms into a p-type Ohmic contact, suggesting that the Schottky barrier can be effectively tuned by changing the interlayer distance in the vdW heterostructure. In addition, it is also possible to modulate the Schottky barrier in the graphene/graphene-like germanium carbide vdW heterostructure by applying a perpendicular electric field. In particular, the positive electric field induces a p-type Ohmic contact, while the negative electric field results in the transition from a p-type to an n-type Schottky contact. Our results demonstrate that controlling the interlayer distance and applying a perpendicular electric field are two promising methods for tuning the electronic properties of the graphene/graphene-like germanium carbide vdW heterostructure, and they can yield dynamic switching among p-type Ohmic contact, p-type Schottky contact, and n-type Schottky contact in a single graphene-based nanoelectronics device.",A compact tunable quadrupole lens for brighter and sharper ultra-fast electron diffraction imaging.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30914665,Scientific reports,2019 04 03,"In this article, we report our proof-of-principle design and experimental commissioning of a broadly tunable and low-cost transverse focusing lens system for MeV-energy electron beams. The lens system based on electromagnetic (EM) quadrupoles has been built as a part of the existing instrument for ultra-fast electron diffraction (UED) experiments at the Accelerator Test Facility II (ATF-II) at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL). We experimentally demonstrated the independent control of the size and divergence of the beam with the charge ranging from 1 to 13 pC. The charge density and divergence of the beam at the sample are the most important factors determining the quality of the Bragg-diffraction image (BDI). By applying the Robust Conjugate Directional Search (RCDS) algorithm for online optimization of the quadrupoles, the transverse beam size can be kept constant down to 75 µm from 1 to 13 pC. The charge density is nearly two orders of magnitude higher than the previously achieved value using a conventional solenoid. Using the BDI method we were able to extract the divergence of the beam in real-time and apply it to the emittance measurement for the first time. Our results agree well with simulations and with the traditional quadrupole scan method. The real-time divergence measurement opens the possibility of online optimization of the beam divergence (<0.2 mrad) at the sample with the increased beam charge. This optimization is crucial for the future development of single-shot ultra-fast electron microscope (UEM). Finally, we demonstrated BDI with significant improvement, up to 3 times higher peak intensity and 2 times sharper Bragg-diffraction peaks at 13 pC. The charge is now limited by the laser power and increasing charge may improve the quality of BDI further. The capability we demonstrated here provides us with opportunities for new sciences using near-parallel, bright and ultrafast electron beams for single-shot imaging, to directly visualize the dynamics of defects and nanostructured materials, or even record molecular movie, which are impossible using present electron-beam technologies."

These natural materials provide a previously-unknown model for bioinspired humidity-stable and dynamically-tunable adhesive materials. In particular, two immiscible liquid phases are identified in bioadhesive fluid extracted from dandelion pollen taken from honey bees: a sugary adhesive aqueous phase similar to bee nectar and an oily phase consistent with plant pollenkitt. Here we show that the aqueous phase exhibits a rate-dependent capillary adhesion attributed to hydrodynamic forces above a critical separation rate. However, the performance of this adhesive phase alone is very sensitive to humidity due to water loss or uptake. Interestingly, the oily phase contributes scarcely to the wet adhesion.

The factors that couple mitochondrial fusion/fission with bioenergetics and their impacts on neurodegeneration however remain poorly understood. Our proteomic analysis identifies mitochondrial protein ATAD3A as an interactor of mitochondrial fission GTPase, Drp1, in HD. Here we show that, in HD, ATAD3A dimerization due to deacetylation at K135 residue is required for Drp1-mediated mitochondrial fragmentation. Disturbance of ATAD3A steady state impairs mtDNA maintenance by disrupting TFAM/mtDNA binding. Blocking Drp1/ATAD3A interaction with a peptide, DA1, abolishes ATAD3A oligomerization, suppresses mitochondrial fragmentation and mtDNA lesion, and reduces bioenergetic deficits and cell death in HD mouse- and patient-derived cells. DA1 treatment reduces behavioral and neuropathological phenotypes in HD transgenic mice. Our findings demonstrate that ATAD3A plays a key role in neurodegeneration by linking Drp1-induced mitochondrial fragmentation to defective mtDNA maintenance, suggesting that DA1 might be useful for developing HD therapeutics.",Water impacts nutrient dose responses genome-wide to affect crop production.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30914651,Nature communications,2019 04 22,"Changes in nutrient dose have dramatic effects on gene expression and development. One outstanding question is whether organisms respond to changes in absolute nutrient amount (moles) vs. its concentration in water (molarity). This question is particularly relevant to plants, as soil drying can alter nutrient concentration, without changing its absolute amount. To compare the effects of amount vs. concentration, we expose rice to a factorial matrix varying the dose of nitrogen (N) and water (W) over a range of combinations, and quantify transcriptome and phenotype responses. Using linear models, we identify distinct dose responses to either N-moles, W-volume, N-molarity (N/W), or their synergistic interaction (N×W). Importantly, genes whose expression patterns are best explained by N-dose and W interactions (N/W or N×W) in seedlings are associated with crop outcomes in replicated field trials.

Here, we develop a simple, mild and efficient polymer-direct-intercalation strategy that different polymers (polyethyleneimine and polyethylene glycol) can directly intercalate into the MoS2 interlayers, forming MoS2-polymer composites and interlayer-expanded MoS2/carbon heteroaerogels after carbonization. The polymer-direct-intercalation behavior has been investigated by substantial characterizations and molecular dynamic calculations. The resulting composite heteroaerogels possess 3D conductive MoS2/C frameworks, expanded MoS2 interlayers (0.98 nm), high MoS2 contents (up to 74%) and high Mo valence (+6), beneficial to fast and stable charge transport and enhanced pseudocapacitive energy storage. Consequently, the typical MoS2/N-doped carbon heteroaerogels exhibit outstanding supercapacitor performance, such as ultrahigh capacitance, remarkable rate capability and excellent cycling stability.

Growth varies as a function of stock density, hence comparisons of growth rates between stocks at known density is particularly valuable. Growth is also related to starting size in males, making raw data on size-specific growth rates more valuable. Internally injected passive tags allowed us to track the growth of male and female individuals over one or two years. The spatial position of tagged recaptures was recorded to measure site fidelity of tagged releases. A total of 3300 pots were fished and their spatial positions were recorded to enable Catch Per Unit Effort calculations. Similarly, spatially geo-referenced v-notching and notched recovery enables spatially gridded densities to be calculated.

The significant problem of oxidizing the solid insulating lithium peroxide can greatly be facilitated by incorporating redox mediators that shuttle electron-holes between the porous substrate and lithium peroxide. Redox mediator stability is thus key for energy efficiency, reversibility, and cycle life. However, the gradual deactivation of redox mediators during repeated cycling has not conclusively been explained. Here, we show that organic redox mediators are predominantly decomposed by singlet oxygen that forms during cycling. Their reaction with superoxide, previously assumed to mainly trigger their degradation, peroxide, and dioxygen, is orders of magnitude slower in comparison. The reduced form of the mediator is markedly more reactive towards singlet oxygen than the oxidized form, from which we derive reaction mechanisms supported by density functional theory calculations. Redox mediators must thus be designed for stability against singlet oxygen.",Patient reported outcomes for preschool children with recurrent wheeze.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30914646,NPJ primary care respiratory medicine,2019 04 02,"Children with preschool wheeze regularly attend UK emergency departments.

In HMM, gains of 9,15 or 19 are the first and clonal events observed as clonal even at MGUS stage.

However, large-scale evidence on species-specific trends among wild pollinators are lacking. Here we show substantial inter-specific variation in pollinator trends, based on occupancy models for 353 wild bee and hoverfly species in Great Britain between 1980 and 2013. Furthermore, we estimate a net loss of over 2.7 million occupied 1 km2 grid cells across all species. Declines in pollinator evenness suggest that losses were concentrated in rare species. In addition, losses linked to specific habitats were identified, with a 55% decline among species associated with uplands. This contrasts with dominant crop pollinators, which increased by 12%, potentially in response agri-environment measures. The general declines highlight a fundamental deterioration in both wider biodiversity and non-crop pollination services.",Choledochoduodenal Fistula Secondary to Peptic Ulcer Disease: A Case Report.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30914631,The American journal of case reports,2019 04 18,"BACKGROUND Choledochoduodenal fistula is an uncommon complication secondary to peptic ulcer disease.

CONCLUSIONS Choledochoduodenal fistula is a rare complication of duodenal ulcer and this case report may help clinicians to identify suspected cases of this entity with similar presentations.",Diosmetin Suppresses Neuronal Apoptosis and Inflammation by Modulating the Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase (PI3K)/AKT/Nuclear Factor-κB (NF-κB) Signaling Pathway in a Rat Model of Pneumococcal Meningitis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30914630,Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research,2019 04 18,"Bacterial meningitis has a high mortality rate and can be challenging to diagnose and manage. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of diosmetin in a rat model of Streptococcus pneumoniae meningitis and to investigate the mechanism of action. Forty rats included a treatment group (n=30) that underwent intracisternal injection with S. pneumoniae, and a sham group (n=10) that underwent intracisternal injection with normal saline. In the treatment group, four days before the inoculation of the bacteria, rats were pre-treated with oral diosmetin 100 mg/kg (n=10) and 200 mg/kg (n=10), and the negative control was pre-treated with normal saline (n=10). Bacterial meningitis was confirmed one day after inoculation by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) bacterial titer and neurological score. In rat brain tissue, levels of inflammatory mediators were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and western blot for protein kinase B (Akt), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MyD88), and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), and the TUNEL assay for apoptosis was performed. In the diosmetin-treated group compared with negative control group, the CSF bacterial titer and the level of pro-inflammatory mediators, and the neurological score, were significantly reduced (p<0.01). In the rat hippocampal tissue, levels of Akt, PI3K, MyD88 and NF-kappaB, and the number of TUNEL-positive apoptotic cells were significantly reduced in the diosmetin-treated group compared with negative control group (p<0.01). In a rat model of bacterial meningitis due to S. pneumoniae, diosmetin reduced neuroinflammation, and neuronal apoptosis by modulating the PI3K/AKT/NF-kappaB signaling pathway.",Estimation of Invasion Depth: The First Key to Successful Colorectal ESD.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30914629,Clinical endoscopy,2019 04 21,"Colorectal tumors with superficial submucosal invasion, which cannot be removed by snaring, are one of the most optimal indications for colorectal endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD). Therefore, estimation of the invasion depth is the first key to successful colorectal ESD. Although estimation of the invasion depth based on the gross morphology may be useful in selected cases, its diagnostic accuracy could not reach the clinical requirement. The Japan Narrow-band Imaging (NBI) Expert Team (JNET) classification of NBI magnifying endoscopy findings is a useful method for histologic prediction and invasion depth estimation. However, magnifying chromoendoscopy is still necessary for JNET type 2B lesions to reach a satisfactory diagnostic accuracy. Endocytoscopy with artificial intelligence is a promising technology in invasion depth estimation; however, more data are needed for its clinical application.",Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection for Colitis-Associated Dysplasia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30914628,Clinical endoscopy,2019 04 21,"Dysplasia is a precancerous lesion of colorectal cancer in patients with long-standing inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Recent guidelines suggest endoscopic resection as a key modality for the treatment of endoscopically resectable dysplasia in patients with colitis. Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) has been suggested as one of the therapeutic options for dysplasia that is potentially resectable but not suitable for the conventional endoscopic mucosal resection technique. Several recent studies supported the feasibility of ESD for the treatment of colitis-associated dysplasia in terms of the en bloc and complete resection rates and the risk of procedure-related complications. However, these studies were performed exclusively in expert centers. Moreover, the local and metachronous recurrence rates were relatively high, and long-term outcome data are still lacking. Endoscopists should be highly skilled in colorectal ESD and have an intensive understanding of not only the lesions but also the conditions of patients with IBDs. Therefore, the decision to perform ESD for colitis-associated dysplasia should be made scrupulously after careful discussion with patients, in collaboration with a multidisciplinary IBD team including physicians, surgeons, and pathologists specialized in IBDs.",[Successful One-Stage Operation for Transverse Colon Cancer with Gastrocolic Fistula and Synchronous Rectal Cancer].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30914626,Gan to kagaku ryoho. Cancer & chemotherapy,2019 03 27,"A 76-year-old man visited our hospital with complaints of appetite loss and diarrhea. Abdominal computed tomography (CT)showed a large transverse colon tumor at the splenic flexure and a gastrocolic fistula. Upper gastrointestinal series and gastroscopy demonstrated a type 2 tumor in the transverse colon and a gastrocolic fistula as the scope was inserted into the transverse colon. Colonoscopy showed a type 2 tumor of the rectum. Based on the diagnosis of advanced transverse colon cancer with gastrocolic fistula and synchronous rectal cancer, a one-stage curative operation was performed. Pathologically, both cancers were well-differentiated adenocarcinomas, but the transvers colon cancer was partially mucinous. Lymph node metastasis was absent. Gastrocolic fistula complicating colon cancer is rare, to our knowledge, with only 29 cases reported in Japan. A curative operation was performed in 73%of these cases, including ours, and lymph node metastasis was observed in only 22%. This suggests that colon cancer with a gastrocolic fistula might undergo less lymph node metastasis despite increased invasion depth, and that a curative operation for the colon cancer and gastrocolic fistula should be considered.",[A Case in Which Acotiamide Hydrochloride Was Effective for Reflux Esophagitis after Distal Gastrectomy with Billroth Ⅰ Reconstruction for Gastric Cancer].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30914625,Gan to kagaku ryoho.

A 25-year-old woman became aware of a lump in her left breast and visited a nearby hospital, where she was diagnosed with breast cancer. She has no personal history. Her paternal grandfather was diagnosed with rectal cancer at age 60. Ultrasonography revealed an irregularly-shaped hypoechoic mass measuring 3.8 cm in the C area of her left breast and an enlarged lymph node 2.0 cm in diameter in the left axillary area. The breast tumor was pathologically diagnosed as invasive ductal carcinoma by core needle biopsy and was immunohistochemically characterized as ER(-), PgR(-), and HER2(-), s o-called triple negative. Moreover, lymph node metastasis was confirmed by fine needle aspiration cytology. She underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy and achieved a clinical complete response. A woman with early-onset triple negative breast cancer has a high probability of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer, with a high risk of ipsilateral second breast cancer after conserving surgery. Thus, BRCA genetic testing may be necessary before surgery. As no pathogenic mutation wasfound in BRCA 1/2 in this case, the patient underwent breast-conserving surgery followed by radiation therapy for the conserved breast.

Multiple liver lesions(S3, S4)were also detected. Histological examination by EUS-FNA showed poorly-differentiated carcinoma; thus, this case was diagnosed with unresectable pancreatic cancer with liver metastases(cT3, cN1[No. 7], cM1[P0, H1], cStage Ⅳ: JPS 7th). After 2 kinds of systemic chemotherapy(9 courses of GEM plus nab-PTX and 9 courses of modified FOLFIRINOX), obvious distant metastases or local progression did not appear and conversion surgery was scheduled. Although a metastatic lesion was identified at S5 of the liver just before the surgery, it was assumed that an R0 resection could be achieved; therefore, the operation(distal pancreatectomy with combined proximal gastrectomy, left adrenalectomy, lymph node dissection, partial hepatectomy of S5, and cholecystectomy)was performed. Histopathological examination showed squamous metaplasia of the epithelial tissue combined with glandular formation. This case was, thus, diagnosed as adenosquamous carcinoma of pancreas.

Complete response(CR)is uncommon; however, if major or complete radiological response are obtained, the issue of the discontinuation of sorafenib remains unresolved. The present study reported a case of a 75-year-old man with non-hepatitis B and C virus-related cirrhosis and multiple recurrent HCCs followingresection. In December 2010, a CT scan revealed multiple intrahepatic recurrence after TACE. Laboratory testingshowed Child-Pugh class A cirrhosis and an alpha-fetoprotein level of over 20,000 ng/mL. Sorafenib(800mg/day)was started in December 2010. The subsequent dynamic CT performed at the 6th month of therapy showed a partial response accordingto RECIST criteria and a complete response accordingto mRECIST. The AFP had decreased to within normal levels. In May 2012, the sorafenib dose was reduced(200 mgtwice daily)due to side effects(skin reaction). In December 2013, treatment was stopped after confirmation of a CR associated with shrinkage of the HCC.

Six cases of gastric endocrine carcinomas that were identified from November 2011 to March 2017 were reviewed. The mean age of the patients was 73.3 years, and 1 patient had StageⅠA cancer, 1 had Stage ⅡB, 2 had Stage ⅢA, and 2 had Stage Ⅳ. Three patients had concomitant conventional adenocarcinoma. Four patients underwent total gastrectomy, 3 of whom showed liver metastases after surgery. The prognosis of gastric endocrine carcinoma is poor because it rapidly metastasizes to the liver and lymph nodes. When unresectable metastatic disease occurs, systemic therapy with cytotoxic chemotherapy can be introduced. Chemotherapy is performed in accordance with that for small cell lung cancer; however, the response rate of chemotherapy is very low, so further studies are needed to improve this treatment.",[A Case of Breast Cancer with Parenchymal and Meningeal Central Nervous System Metastases Treated with Multimodality Therapy].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30914585,Gan to kagaku ryoho.

After the surgery, chemotherapy, post-mastectomy radiation therapy, and HER2-targeted therapy were administered as adjuvant therapies. Two years and 6 months postoperatively, she complained of headaches and nausea. Magnetic resonance imaging showed brain metastasis, which was treated with gamma knife surgery. Two weeks later, she was urgently admitted to the hospital because of impaired consciousness. Based on cerebrospinal fluid cytology, she was diagnosed with meningeal metastasis of breast cancer. She developed hydrocephalus; thus, external ventricular drainage was performed, and a ventriculoperitoneal shunt was inserted. She was treated with whole-brain irradiation(30 Gy)and trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1)as systemic therapy. Treatment of the patient was possible without recurrence continuously for over 12 months and with the maintenance of daily activities. The prognosis of patients with meningeal metastasis of breast cancer is extremely poor, and effective pharmacotherapy has not yet been established.

Cancer & chemotherapy,2019 03 27,"Although S-1 is an effective oral anticancer drug in patients with metastatic breast cancer, it is difficult for some patients to continue taking S-1 because of its side effects in the approved regimen of 4 weeks of administration followed by a 2-week rest. When S-1 is administered for 5 days followed by a 2-day rest(5-day on/2-day off), the drug concentration is almost equal to that of the approved regimen, and it can be administered for longer without deterioration of its clinical effect. We retrospectively analyzed the effect and safety in 25 cases in which S-1 was administered using the ""5-day on/2-day off"" regimen in patients with metastatic breast cancer between November 2006 and August 2014 in our hospital. Patients were all female, and their median age was 68 years(44-87). ER was positive/negative in 15/10 cases, and PS 0/1/2were found in 8/ 10/7 cases. They had no prior chemotherapy and had measurable lesions. S-1 was administered at a dose of 80mg/m2 twice a day on a ""5-day on/2-day off"" schedule and was reduced when its side effects were appeared. The median treatment duration was 25(3-214)weeks, and CR/PR/long SD/SD/PD as clinical responses were observed in 0/8/5/5/7 cases. The overall response rate was 32% and clinical benefit rate was 52%. There was no difference in response rates whether visceral metastases were present or not. In terms of hematologic toxicity, anemia was seen in one case, and there were no cases of neutropenia. In non-hematologic toxicity, no more than Grade 3 side effects were shown. Discontinuance was observed in only one case because of diarrhea. A ""5-day on/2-day off"" regimen of S-1 in metastatic breast cancer is well tolerated, and we can continue administering it to elderly patients or those with poor PS without reducing QOL; thus, it can be considered as one of the effective metronomic treatments. In the future, a prospective study is warranted to ascertain these results."

A 76-year-old man noticed an upper abdominal tumor and he visited our department for detailed examination. Enhanced CT scan showed multiple hypervascular tumors scattered across both lobes of the liver, and the pattern of contrast effect implied that the tumors were primary neuroendocrine tumors or endocrine metastases. Gastroscopy and colonoscopy showed no tumor in the intestine. TACE was performed mainly for the tumors in the right lobe. One month later, we performed left lateral segmentectomy and partial hepatectomy for segment 6.

S-1 was administered continuously as postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy, and the patient showed no signs of recurrence. Three years after the surgery, a CT scan showed LDA 10mm in diameter in the middle area of the remnant liver. We suspected liver metastasis when both serum CA19-9 and DUPAN-2 levels were elevated with the increasing size of LDA; liver biopsy was then performed, and he was diagnosed with liver metastasis of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. After 3 courses of combination chemotherapy containing GEM and CDDP, a CT scan revealed that the liver metastasis reduced in size, and PR was achieved based on the RECIST standard. After 12 courses, the liver metastasis disappeared, and the patient had achieved CR based on the RECIST standard.

In this study, 15 cases of primary duodenal cancer that were treated by curative resection in our hospital between April 2005 and December 2017 were analyzed to study appropriate operative procedures. Prognostic analysis revealed that the median of relapse-free survival and overall survival were 49 months and 74 months, respectively. The 5-year survival rate was 47%. On univariate analysis of relapse-free survival, lymph node metastasis(p<0.01)and post-operative adjuvant therapy(p=0.02)were significant independent prognostic factors. Analysis of the relationship between lymph node metastasis and the depth or location of tumors suggested that pancreaticoduodenectomy with lymph node dissection should be performed to achieve radical resection, since there were some cases that involved lymph node metastasis around the pancreatic head or hepatoduodenal ligament."

Cancer & chemotherapy,2019 03 27,"Although the first-line treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC)is hepatectomy, extreme elderly(80 years or older) patients often tend to have a variety of underlying diseases and decreased cardiopulmonary function, which means that surgery involves a high risk. In this case, we examined the safety and efficacy of hepatectomy performed in an extreme elderly patient with HCC. Of the patients with HCC that underwent initial hepatectomy at Kobe University Hospital(n=348)between 2009 and 2015, 23 patients aged 80 years or older at the time of surgery(Group 1, n=23)and those younger than 80 years at the time(Group 2, n=325)were compared, based on parameters related to safety and prognosis. We did not identify differences between the 2 groups with respect to blood loss and operating time. Intraoperative blood transfusion was more common in Group 1. There was no significant difference between the 2 groups with respect to complications of Grade Ⅲ or higher. The median survival of Group 2 patients following hepatectomy(42 months)was better than that of Group 1 patients(34 months), but there was no significant difference between the 2 groups(p=0.429). Furthermore, when the same parameters were compared after adjusting for and matching propensity scores, there were no significant differences in complications, hospitalization periods, and prognosis between the 2 groups. Through proper assessment of oncologic factors and patient risk factors, hepatectomy can be performed safely and effectively even for extreme elderly patients with HCC. If there is no other disease regulating the prognosis, we can expect to achieve similar prognosis in non-extreme elderly patients. Hence, treatments should not be limited solely based on a patient being extremely elderly; rather, proactive treatments should be considered.",[Advanced-Stage Breast Cancer Discovered by Cervical Lymphadenopathy in an Elderly Patient-Report of a Case].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30914544,Gan to kagaku ryoho.

On receiving the biopsy result, she was referred for a suspected metastatic lymph node from breast cancer. The tumor was 40mm in diameter and was palpable in the CD area of her left breast, accompanied by pain. Ultrasonography showed an irregular-shaped mass. Core needle biopsy was performed, and the pathological diagnosis was invasive lobular carcinoma. Her body check-up revealed multiple enlarged lymph nodes from the left axilla to the supraclavicular and cervical areas. We diagnosed her clinical stage with T2N3cM1, stage Ⅳ(LYM). We proceeded with surgery to alleviate the symptom. Breast reduction surgery was performed for the left breast.

Subsequently, laparoscopic low anterior resection and dissection of the bilateral lymph nodes were performed. After the surgery, adjuvant chemotherapy with FOLFOX was administered. Afterwards, the patient developed severe anal pain and visited us for treatment. The severe anal pain continued even after FOLFOX treatment and increased with defecation. A side effect of oxaliplatin was suspected, and sLV5FU chemotherapy was administered. As a result, the anal pain disappeared. Thus, the pain was considered to be induced by oxaliplatin. While peripheral neuropathy is a widely known side effect of oxaliplatin, this case was considered to be unique because anal pain occurs very rarely with oxaliplatin treatment."

The EMK are for the patient or family caregivers to use at the direction of their home hospice nurse or physician. Medications in the EMK are selected for their versatility in potentially addressing multiple symptoms, and their ability to be administered buccally, sublingually, or transdermally, simplifying administration by family caregivers. The EMK facilitate timely symptom control, allowing families to avoid emergency department visits, unscheduled nursing visits, and usually result in cost savings. Additionally, family caregivers feel empowered by its presence in their home and its contribution to patient, family caregiver and nurse satisfaction. To date in Japan, the literature related to the use and impact of EMKs is sparse. Further investigation is needed into the use, clinical efficacy, and impact of the EMK.",[Carcinogenesis and Gut Microbiota].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30914517,Gan to kagaku ryoho. Cancer & chemotherapy,2019 03 27,"Recent developments in techniques of metabologenomics have given a better understanding the association of gut microbiota with various diseases. Gut microbiota has a strong impact on host immunostasis and homeostasis of gut function for maintaining the health condition. Dysbiosis leads to an increase in bacterial populations that stimulate tumorigenesis, and contributes to epithelial carcinogenesis and tumor progression by altering metabolic properties(such as bile acid and butyric acid)and inflammatory process. Inflammation aid the bacterial translocation into the neoplastic tissue, which in turn promotes production of inflammatory cytokines subsequently leading to tumor growth. The colonic microbiota such as enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis(ETBF)may also promote colorectal cancer by stimulating exaggerated immune responses via Th17 cells. Dysbiosis caused by a deficiency of the NLRP6 inflammasome promotes cancer development via interleukin-6(IL- 6)-induced epithelial proliferation. Emerging data suggest that certain groups of bacteria might promote whereas others might protect against colon cancer. Indeed, Fusobacteriumnucleatum (F. nucleatum)seems to play a central role in the tumor microenvironment as its abundance correlates with cancer progression as well as the dysbiotic tumor microbiota composition including Bacteroides and Prevotella species. Moreover, gut microbiota not only plays a key role in carcinogenesis but also influences the efficacy and toxicity of cancer immunotherapy, especially immune checkpoint inhibitors by targeting the programmed death receptor 1(PD-1)and the cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4(CTLA-4).",Dynamic Dystroglycan Complexes Mediate Cell Entry of Lassa Virus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30914516,mBio,2019 05 15,"Recognition of functional receptors by viruses is a key determinant for their host range, tissue tropism, and disease potential. The highly pathogenic Lassa virus (LASV) currently represents one of the most important emerging pathogens. The major cellular receptor for LASV in human cells is the ubiquitously expressed and evolutionary highly conserved extracellular matrix receptor dystroglycan (DG). In the host, DG interacts with many cellular proteins in a tissue-specific manner. The resulting distinct supramolecular complexes likely represent the functional units for viral entry, and preexisting protein-protein interactions may critically influence DG's function in productive viral entry. Using an unbiased shotgun proteomic approach, we define the largely unknown molecular composition of DG complexes present in highly susceptible epithelial cells that represent important targets for LASV during viral transmission. We further show that the specific composition of cellular DG complexes can affect DG's function in receptor-mediated endocytosis of the virus. Under steady-state conditions, epithelial DG complexes underwent rapid turnover via an endocytic pathway that shared some characteristics with DG-mediated LASV entry. However, compared to steady-state uptake of DG, LASV entry via DG occurred faster and critically depended on additional signaling by receptor tyrosine kinases and the downstream effector p21-activating kinase. In sum, we show that the specific molecular composition of DG complexes in susceptible cells is a determinant for productive virus entry and that the pathogen can manipulate the existing DG-linked endocytic pathway. This highlights another level of complexity of virus-receptor interaction and provides possible cellular targets for therapeutic antiviral intervention.IMPORTANCE Recognition of cellular receptors allows emerging viruses to break species barriers and is an important determinant for their disease potential. Many virus receptors have complex tissue-specific interactomes, and preexisting protein-protein interactions may influence their function. Combining shotgun proteomics with a biochemical approach, we characterize the molecular composition of the functional receptor complexes used by the highly pathogenic Lassa virus (LASV) to invade susceptible human cells. We show that the specific composition of the receptor complexes affects productive entry of the virus, providing proof-of-concept. In uninfected cells, these functional receptor complexes undergo dynamic turnover involving an endocytic pathway that shares some characteristics with viral entry. However, steady-state receptor uptake and virus endocytosis critically differ in kinetics and underlying signaling, indicating that the pathogen can manipulate the receptor complex according to its needs. Our study highlights a remarkable complexity of LASV-receptor interaction and identifies possible targets for therapeutic antiviral intervention.",Infection by Anaplasma phagocytophilum Requires Recruitment of Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol by Flotillins.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30914515,mBio,2019 05 15,"Anaplasma phagocytophilum is an obligatory intracellular bacterium that proliferates in membrane-bound inclusions. A. phagocytophilum is dependent on cholesterol and acquire cholesterol from low-density lipoprotein (LDL) endocytosed by mammalian host cells. The mechanism of cholesterol transport to Anaplasma inclusions, however, is not fully understood. Flotillin-1 (FLOT1) and FLOT2 are cholesterol-associated membrane proteins that form a heterodimer and/or oligomer complex. Here, we found that Anaplasma infection was significantly reduced by small interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown of FLOT1 or FLOT2. Anaplasma inclusions were encircled with small vesicles containing endogenous FLOT1 or FLOT2 or with ectopically expressed FLOT1-mCherry and FLOT2-green fluorescent protein (FLOT2-GFP). FLOT1- and FLOT2-containing vesicles were enriched with unesterified cholesterol, as indicated by labeling with filipin and aminomethyl coumarin acetic acid-conjugated theonellamide. Localization of FLOT2 to Anaplasma inclusions was dependent on cholesterol, as FLOT2-GFP bearing two mutations in the cholesterol recognition/interaction motif could not target the inclusions. The cholesterol-sequestering agent methyl-β-cyclodextrin abrogated FLOT1 localization to Anaplasma inclusions and cleared infection. FLOT2-GFP also localized to fluorescent 3,3'-dioctadecylindocarbocyanine (DiI)-LDL-containing vesicles, including those surrounding Anaplasma inclusions. FLOT2 siRNA knockdown blocked DiI-LDL trafficking to Anaplasma inclusions and reduced bacteria-associated cholesterol amount, and therefore inhibiting Anaplasma infection. Vesicles containing acid lipase, which hydrolyzes LDL cholesterol esters to free cholesterol, colocalized with FLOT2 and encircled Anaplasma inclusions, while the acid lipase inhibitor orlistat significantly inhibited Anaplasma replication. Together, the data revealed that FLOTs are crucial for Anaplasma replication in host cells, likely by aiding vesicular traffic of LDL-derived free cholesterol to Anaplasma inclusions, and suggest a new way of inhibiting Anaplasma infection.IMPORTANCE Cholesterol is essential for animal cells, but most bacteria do not depend on cholesterol and instead lack cholesterol. However, the intracellular Gram-negative bacterium Anaplasma phagocytophilum that causes human granulocytic anaplasmosis (HGA) is unusual, as it contains significant amount of cholesterol and depends on cholesterol for survival and infection. A. phagocytophilum lacks genes for cholesterol biosynthesis or modification but acquire cholesterol from host cells exclusively from the LDL uptake pathway by a yet-to-be defined mechanism. Here, we uncovered a role of cholesterol-binding proteins FLOT1 and FLOT2 in LDL-derived cholesterol trafficking to Anaplasma inclusions and cholesterol acquisition by Anaplasma species. Importantly, we found that FLOTs localize to A. phagocytophilum-containing inclusions and the compartments containing LDL, and the acid lipase inhibitor orlistat significantly inhibits Anaplasma replication. Our data suggest a fundamental role of FLOTs in intracellular vesicular transport of LDL-derived free cholesterol and may provide insight regarding a new therapeutic target for HGA treatment.",Gut Microbiota Metabolite Indole Propionic Acid Targets Tryptophan Biosynthesis in Mycobacterium tuberculosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30914514,mBio,2019 05 15,"Indole propionic acid (IPA), produced by the gut microbiota, is active against Mycobacterium tuberculosisin vitro and in vivo However, its mechanism of action is unknown. IPA is the deamination product of tryptophan (Trp) and thus a close structural analog of this essential aromatic amino acid. De novo Trp biosynthesis in M. tuberculosis is regulated through feedback inhibition: Trp acts as an allosteric inhibitor of anthranilate synthase TrpE, which catalyzes the first committed step in the Trp biosynthesis pathway. Hence, we hypothesized that IPA may mimic Trp as an allosteric inhibitor of TrpE and exert its antimicrobial effect by blocking synthesis of Trp at the TrpE catalytic step. To test our hypothesis, we carried out metabolic, chemical rescue, genetic, and biochemical analyses. Treatment of mycobacteria with IPA inhibited growth and reduced the intracellular level of Trp, an effect abrogated upon supplementation of Trp in the medium. Missense mutations at the allosteric Trp binding site of TrpE eliminated Trp inhibition and caused IPA resistance. In conclusion, we have shown that IPA blocks Trp biosynthesis in M. tuberculosis via inhibition of TrpE by mimicking the physiological allosteric inhibitor of this enzyme.IMPORTANCE New drugs against tuberculosis are urgently needed. The tryptophan (Trp) analog indole propionic acid (IPA) is the first antitubercular metabolite produced by human gut bacteria. Here, we show that this antibiotic blocks Trp synthesis, an in vivo essential biosynthetic pathway in M. tuberculosis Intriguingly, IPA acts by decoupling a bacterial feedback regulatory mechanism: it mimics Trp as allosteric inhibitor of anthranilate synthase, thereby switching off Trp synthesis regardless of intracellular Trp levels. The identification of IPA's target paves the way for the discovery of more potent TrpE ligands employing rational, target-based lead optimization.",Biphasic Dynamics of Macrophage Immunometabolism during Mycobacterium tuberculosis Infection.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30914513,mBio,2019 05 15,"Macrophages are the primary targets of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection; the early events of macrophage interaction with M. tuberculosis define subsequent progression and outcome of infection. M. tuberculosis can alter the innate immunity of macrophages, resulting in suboptimal Th1 immunity, which contributes to the survival, persistence, and eventual dissemination of the pathogen. Recent advances in immunometabolism illuminate the intimate link between the metabolic states of immune cells and their specific functions. In this review, we describe the little-studied biphasic metabolic dynamics of the macrophage response during progression of infection by M. tuberculosis and discuss their relevance to macrophage immunity and M. tuberculosis pathogenicity. The early phase of macrophage infection, which is marked by M1 polarization, is accompanied by a metabolic switch from mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation to hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1α)-mediated aerobic glycolysis (also known as the Warburg effect in cancer cells), as well as by an upregulation of pathways involving oxidative and antioxidative defense responses, arginine metabolism, and synthesis of bioactive lipids. These early metabolic changes are followed by a late adaptation/resolution phase in which macrophages transition from glycolysis to mitochondrial oxidative metabolism, with a consequent dampening of macrophage proinflammatory and antimicrobial responses. Importantly, the identification of upregulated metabolic pathways and/or metabolic regulatory mechanisms with immunomodulatory functions during M1 polarization has revealed novel mechanisms of M. tuberculosis pathogenicity. These advances can lead to the development of novel host-directed therapies to facilitate bacterial clearance in tuberculosis by targeting the metabolic state of immune cells.",Rapid Replacement of Acinetobacter baumannii Strains Accompanied by Changes in Lipooligosaccharide Loci and Resistance Gene Repertoire.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30914511,mBio,2019 05 15,"The population structure of health care-associated pathogens reflects patterns of diversification, selection, and dispersal over time. Empirical data detailing the long-term population dynamics of nosocomial pathogens provide information about how pathogens adapt in the face of exposure to diverse antimicrobial agents and other host and environmental pressures and can inform infection control priorities. Extensive sequencing of clinical isolates from one hospital spanning a decade and a second hospital in the Cleveland, OH, metropolitan area over a 3-year time period provided high-resolution genomic analysis of the Acinetobacter baumannii metapopulation. Genomic analysis demonstrated an almost complete replacement of the predominant strain groups with a new, genetically distinct strain group during the study period. The new group, termed clade F, differs from other global clone 2 (GC2) strains of A. baumannii in several ways, including its antibiotic resistance and lipooligosaccharide biosynthesis genes. Clade F strains are part of a large phylogenetic group with broad geographic representation. Phylogenetic analysis of single-nucleotide variants in core genome regions showed that although the Cleveland strains are phylogenetically distinct from those isolated from other locations, extensive intermixing of strains from the two hospital systems was apparent, suggesting either substantial exchange of strains or a shared, but geographically restricted, external pool from which infectious isolates were drawn. These findings document the rapid evolution of A. baumannii strains in two hospitals, with replacement of the predominant clade by a new clade with altered lipooligosaccharide loci and resistance gene repertoires.IMPORTANCE Multidrug-resistant (MDR) A. baumannii is a difficult-to-treat health care-associated pathogen. Knowing the resistance genes present in isolates causing infection aids in empirical treatment selection. Furthermore, knowledge of the genetic background can assist in tracking patterns of transmission to limit the spread of infections in hospitals. The appearance of a new genetic background in A. baumannii strains with a different set of resistance genes and cell surface structures suggests that strong selective pressures exist, even in highly MDR pathogens. Because the new strains have levels of antimicrobial resistance similar to those of the strains that were displaced, we hypothesize that other features, including host colonization and infection, may confer additional selective advantages and contribute to their increased prevalence."

Fruit size and shape are important quality traits influencing yield and market value; however, the underlying mechanism regulating the balance of fruit growth to achieve final size and shape is not well understood. Here, we report a mechanistic model that governs cucumber (Cucumis sativus) fruit elongation through fine-tuning of ethylene homeostasis. We identified a cucumber mutant that bears short fruits owing to repressed cell division. SF1 (Short Fruit 1) encodes a cucurbit-specific RING-type E3 ligase, and the mutation resulted in its enhanced self-ubiquitination and degradation, but accumulation of ACS2 (1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate synthase 2), a rate-limiting enzyme for ethylene biosynthesis. The overproduction of ethylene contributes to the short-fruit phenotype of sf1 Dysfunction of ACS2 resulted in reduced ethylene production, but still repressed cell division and shorter fruit, suggesting that ethylene is still required for basal fruit elongation. SF1 ubiquitinates and degrades both itself and ACS2 to control ethylene synthesis for dose-dependent effect on cell division and fruit elongation. Our findings reveal the mechanism by which ethylene dosage is regulated for the control of cell division in developing fruit.",Glycome and Proteome Components of Golgi Membranes Are Common between Two Angiosperms with Distinct Cell-Wall Structures.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30914498,The Plant cell,2019 06 10,"The plant endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi apparatus is the site of synthesis, assembly, and trafficking of all noncellulosic polysaccharides, proteoglycans, and proteins destined for the cell wall. As grass species make cell walls distinct from those of dicots and noncommelinid monocots, it has been assumed that the differences in cell-wall composition stem from differences in biosynthetic capacities of their respective Golgi. However, immunosorbence-based screens and carbohydrate linkage analysis of polysaccharides in Golgi membranes, enriched by flotation centrifugation from etiolated coleoptiles of maize (Zea mays) and leaves of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), showed that arabinogalactan-proteins and arabinans represent substantial portions of the Golgi-resident polysaccharides not typically found in high abundance in cell walls of either species. Further, hemicelluloses accumulated in Golgi at levels that contrasted with those found in their respective cell walls, with xyloglucans enriched in maize Golgi, and xylans enriched in Arabidopsis. Consistent with this finding, maize Golgi membranes isolated by flotation centrifugation and enriched further by free-flow electrophoresis, yielded >200 proteins known to function in the biosynthesis and metabolism of cell-wall polysaccharides common to all angiosperms, and not just those specific to cell-wall type. We propose that the distinctive compositions of grass primary cell walls compared with other angiosperms result from differential gating or metabolism of secreted polysaccharides post-Golgi by an as-yet unknown mechanism, and not necessarily by differential expression of genes encoding specific synthase complexes.",High Temporal-Resolution Transcriptome Landscape of Early Maize Seed Development.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30914497,The Plant cell,2019 06 10,"The early maize (Zea mays) seed undergoes several developmental stages after double fertilization to become fully differentiated within a short period of time, but the genetic control of this highly dynamic and complex developmental process remains largely unknown.

These time-course transcriptomes were clearly separated into four distinct groups corresponding to the stages of double fertilization, coenocyte formation, cellularization, and differentiation. A total of 22,790 expressed genes including 1415 transcription factors (TFs) were detected in early stages of maize seed development. In particular, 1093 genes including 110 TFs were specifically expressed in the seed and displayed high temporal specificity by expressing only in particular period of early seed development. There were 160, 22, 112, and 569 seed-specific genes predominantly expressed in the first 16 h after pollination, coenocyte formation, cellularization, and differentiation stage, respectively. In addition, network analysis predicted 31,256 interactions among 1317 TFs and 14,540 genes.

The NL is a protein mesh that resides underneath the inner nuclear membrane and consists of lamins and lamina-associated proteins. Chromatin regions associated with lamins in animals are characterized mostly by constitutive heterochromatin, but association with facultative heterochromatin mediated by Polycomb-group (PcG) proteins has been reported as well. In contrast with animals, plant NL components are largely not conserved and NL association with chromatin is poorly explored.

Moreover, we demonstrate that transiently expressed PWO1 proteins form foci located partially at the subnuclear periphery. Ultimately, as CRWN1 and PWO1 are plant-specific, our results argue that plants might have developed an equivalent, rather than homologous, mechanism of linking chromatin repression and NL.",OsSHI1 Regulates Plant Architecture Through Modulating the Transcriptional Activity of IPA1 in Rice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30914468,The Plant cell,2019 06 10,"Tillering and panicle branching are important determinants of plant architecture and yield potential in rice (Oryza sativa).

Here, we report the identification of a rice mutant named shi1 that is characterized by dramatically reduced tiller number, enhanced culm strength, and increased panicle branch number. Map-based cloning revealed that O. sativa SHORT INTERNODES1 (OsSHI1) encodes a plant-specific transcription factor of the SHI family with a characteristic family-specific IGGH domain and a conserved zinc-finger DNA binding domain. Consistent with the mutant phenotype, OsSHI1 is predominantly expressed in axillary buds and young panicle, and its encoded protein is exclusively targeted to the nucleus. We show that OsSHI1 physically interacts with IPA1 both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, OsSHI1 could bind directly to the promoter regions of both OsTB1 and OsDEP1 through a previously unrecognized cis-element (T/GCTCTAC motif). OsSHI1 repressed the transcriptional activation activity of IPA1 by affecting its DNA binding activity toward the promoters of both OsTB1 and OsDEP1, resulting in increased tiller number and diminished panicle size. Taken together, our results demonstrate that OsSHI1 regulates plant architecture through modulating the transcriptional activity of IPA1 and provide insight into the establishment of plant architecture in rice.",The Transcription Factors TCP4 and PIF3 Antagonistically Regulate Organ-Specific Light Induction of SAUR Genes to Modulate Cotyledon Opening during De-Etiolation in Arabidopsis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30914467,The Plant cell,2019 06 10,"Light elicits different growth responses in different organs of plants. These organ-specific responses are prominently displayed during de-etiolation. While major light-responsive components and early signaling pathways in this process have been identified, this information has yet to explain how organ-specific light responses are achieved. Here, we report that members of the TEOSINTE BRANCHED1, CYCLOIDEA, and PCF (TCP) transcription factor family participate in photomorphogenesis and facilitate light-induced cotyledon opening in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing and RNA sequencing analyses indicated that TCP4 targets a number of SMALL AUXIN UPREGULATED RNA (SAUR) genes that have previously been shown to exhibit organ-specific, light-responsive expression. We demonstrate that TCP4-like transcription factors, which are predominantly expressed in the cotyledons of both light- and dark-grown seedlings, activate SAUR16 and SAUR50 expression in response to light. Light regulates the binding of TCP4 to the promoters of SAUR14, SAUR16, and SAUR50 through PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTORs (PIFs). PIF3, which accumulates in etiolated seedlings and its levels rapidly decline upon light exposure, also binds to the SAUR16 and SAUR50 promoters, while suppressing the binding of TCP4 to these promoters in the dark. Our study reveals that the interplay between light-responsive factors PIFs and the developmental regulator TCP4 determines the cotyledon-specific light regulation of SAUR16 and SAUR50, which contributes to cotyledon closure and opening before and after de-etiolation.",Clinical and Prognostic Characteristics of 53 Cases of Extracranial Malignant Rhabdoid Tumor in Children.

The aim of this review is to present an optimized treatment schema and the accompanying diagnostic testing approach for patients with advanced NSCLC. There are a number of therapies currently approved for patients with advanced NSCLC, including agents that target particular oncogenic drivers, as well as immune checkpoint blockers (ICBs) that elicit an antitumor response. Identification of genetic alterations (e.g., epidermal growth factor receptor, anaplastic lymphoma kinase, reactive oxygen species proto-oncogene 1, B-Raf proto-oncogene) or programmed cell death ligand-1 expression levels in NSCLC requires diligent molecular testing at initial diagnosis and, in some cases, at disease progression to ensure the most efficacious treatment is delivered. Accurate molecular diagnostic testing, along with the careful selection of currently approved targeted agents, ICBs, or systemic chemotherapy, provides therapy that is personalized according to patients' needs to achieve the best possible outcome. Enrollment in clinical trials that further the development of tailored therapies is highly recommended at all stages of treatment. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Targeted therapies and immune checkpoint blockers provide effective and tailored options for patients with non-small cell lung cancer. Careful molecular analysis of tumor samples is necessary to identify the genetic alterations that are present, to ensure that each patient receives the most efficacious treatment for their specific tumor type.

The trial also demonstrated improvement in overall survival (HR 0.66; 95% CI: 0.46-0.95), complete response rate (68% vs. 56%), and overall response rate (83% vs. 72%) with BV+CHP. The most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥20%) observed ≥2% more with BV+CHP were nausea, diarrhea, fatigue or asthenia, mucositis, pyrexia, vomiting, and anemia. Peripheral neuropathy rates were similar (52% with BV+CHP, 55% with CHOP). Through the Real-Time Oncology Review pilot program, which allows FDA early access to key data, FDA granted this approval less than 2 weeks after official submission of the application. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: This is the first U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval for treatment of patients with newly diagnosed peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCL). Improvement in progression-free and overall survival over cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone chemotherapy, which has been the standard of care for decades, is unprecedented. The new regimen represents a major advance for the frontline treatment of patients with CD30-expressing PTCL.",Redefining bilingualism as a spectrum of experiences that differentially affects brain structure and function.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30914463,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2019 05 22,"Learning and using an additional language is shown to have an impact on the structure and function of the brain, including in regions involved in cognitive control and the connections between them. However, the available evidence remains variable in terms of the localization, extent, and trajectory of these effects. Variability likely stems from the fact that bilingualism has been routinely operationalized as a categorical variable (bilingual/monolingual), whereas it is a complex and dynamic experience with a number of potentially deterministic factors affecting neural plasticity. Here we present a study investigating the combined effects of experience-based factors (EBFs) in bilingual language use on brain structure and functional connectivity. EBFs include an array of measures of everyday usage of a second language in different types of immersive settings (e.g., amount of use in social settings). Analyses reveal specific adaptations in the brain, both structural and functional, correlated to individual EBFs and their combined effects. Taken together, the data show that the brain adapts to be maximally efficient in the processing and control of two languages, although modulated ultimately by individual language experience.",Targeting pericyte-endothelial cell crosstalk by circular RNA-cPWWP2A inhibition aggravates diabetes-induced microvascular dysfunction.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30914462,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2019 05 22,"The crosstalk between vascular pericytes and endothelial cells (ECs) is critical for microvascular stabilization and remodeling; however, the crosstalk is often disrupted by diabetes, leading to severe and even lethal vascular damage. Circular RNAs are a class of endogenous RNAs that regulate several important physiological and pathological processes. Here we show that diabetes-related stress up-regulates cPWWP2A expression in pericytes but not in ECs. In vitro studies show that cPWWP2A directly regulates pericyte biology but indirectly regulates EC biology via exosomes carrying cPWWP2A. cPWWP2A acts as an endogenous miR-579 sponge to sequester and inhibit miR-579 activity, leading to increased expression of angiopoietin 1, occludin, and SIRT1. In vivo studies show that cPWWP2A overexpression or miR-579 inhibition alleviates diabetes mellitus-induced retinal vascular dysfunction. By contrast, inhibition of cPWWP2A-mediated signaling by silencing cPWWP2A or overexpressing miR-579 aggravates retinal vascular dysfunction. Collectively, this study unveils a mechanism by which pericytes and ECs communicate. Intervention of cPWWP2A or miR-579 expression may offer opportunities for treating diabetic microvascular complications.",Crystal structure and activity-based labeling reveal the mechanisms for linkage-specific substrate recognition by deubiquitinase USP9X.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30914461,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2019 05 22,"USP9X is a conserved deubiquitinase (DUB) that regulates multiple cellular processes. Dysregulation of USP9X has been linked to cancers and X-linked intellectual disability. Here, we report the crystal structure of the USP9X catalytic domain at 2.5-Å resolution. The structure reveals a canonical USP-fold comprised of fingers, palm, and thumb subdomains, as well as an unusual β-hairpin insertion. The catalytic triad of USP9X is aligned in an active configuration. USP9X is exclusively active against ubiquitin (Ub) but not Ub-like modifiers. Cleavage assays with di-, tri-, and tetraUb chains show that the USP9X catalytic domain has a clear preference for K11-, followed by K63-, K48-, and K6-linked polyUb chains. Using a set of activity-based diUb and triUb probes (ABPs), we demonstrate that the USP9X catalytic domain has an exo-cleavage preference for K48- and endo-cleavage preference for K11-linked polyUb chains. The structure model and biochemical data suggest that the USP9X catalytic domain harbors three Ub binding sites, and a zinc finger in the fingers subdomain and the β-hairpin insertion both play important roles in polyUb chain processing and linkage specificity. Furthermore, unexpected labeling of a secondary, noncatalytic cysteine located on a blocking loop adjacent to the catalytic site by K11-diUb ABP implicates a previously unreported mechanism of polyUb chain recognition. The structural features of USP9X revealed in our study are critical for understanding its DUB activity. The new Ub-based ABPs form a set of valuable tools to understand polyUb chain processing by the cysteine protease class of DUBs.",Parental divorce is not uniformly disruptive to children's educational attainment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30914460,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2019 05 22,"Children whose parents divorce tend to have worse educational outcomes than children whose parents stay married. However, not all children respond identically to their parents divorcing. We focus on how the impact of parental divorce on children's education varies by how likely or unlikely divorce was for those parents. We find a significant negative effect of parental divorce on educational attainment, particularly college attendance and completion, among children whose parents were unlikely to divorce. Families expecting marital stability, unprepared for disruption, may experience considerable adjustment difficulties when divorce occurs, leading to negative outcomes for children. By contrast, we find no effect of parental divorce among children whose parents were likely to divorce. Children of high-risk marriages, who face many social disadvantages over childhood irrespective of parental marital status, may anticipate or otherwise accommodate to the dissolution of their parents' marriage. Our results suggest that family disruption does not uniformly disrupt children's attainment."

In pleiotropically linked receptor systems, this leads to selective activation of some signaling pathways at the expense of others (biased signaling). This article summarizes the current knowledge about the complex components of receptor systems, the evidence that biased signaling is used in natural physiology to fine-tune signaling, and the current thoughts on how this mechanism may be applied to the design of better drugs. Although this is a fairly newly discovered phenomenon, theoretical and experimental data suggest that it is a ubiquitous behavior of ligands and receptors and to be expected. Biased signaling is simple to detect in vitro and there are numerous methods to quantify the effect with scales that can be used to optimize this activity in structure-activity medicinal chemistry studies. At present, the major hurdle in the application of this mechanism to therapeutics is the translation of in vitro bias to in vivo effect; this is because of the numerous factors that can modify measures of bias in natural physiologic systems. In spite of this, biased signaling still has the potential to justify revisiting of receptor targets previously thought to be intractable and also furnishes the means to pursue targets previously thought to be forbidden due to deleterious physiology (as these may be eliminated through biased signaling).",Interleukin-35 promotes early endothelialization after stent implantation by regulating macrophage activation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30914441,"Clinical science (London, England : 1979)",2019 04 09,"Background: Early strut coverage after sirolimus-eluting stent (SES) implantation is associated with the activation of inflammation, but the underlying mechanisms are not completely understood. The present study aimed to identify the relationship between the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL) 35 (IL-35) and early strut coverage in vivo and in vitroMethods: We utilized a retrospective study design to measure IL-35 levels in 68 stents from 68 patients with coronary artery disease and recorded serial optical coherence tomography (OCT) images (0 and 3 months) to assess stent endothelialization. The mechanism underlying the regulatory effects of IL-35 on macrophages and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) was also investigated. SESs were surgically implanted into the right common carotid arteries of 200 male New Zealand White rabbits receiving intravenous injections of IL-35 or a placebo.Results: At the 3-month OCT evaluation, complete endothelium coverage was correlated with IL-35 levels. IL-35 induced the activation of an anti-inflammatory M2-like macrophage phenotype by targeting the signal transducer and activators of transcription (STAT)1/4 signalling pathway, and IL-35-treated macrophages induced endothelial proliferation and alleviated endothelial dysfunction. IL-35-treated New Zealand White rabbits with implanted SESs showed lower percentages of cross-sections with an uncovered strut, elevated mean neointimal hyperplasia (NIH) thickness, and inhibited inflammatory responses.Conclusions: We investigated the effect of IL-35 expression on early stent endothelialization in vivo and in vitro and identified a crucial role for IL-35 in inducing the activation of an anti-inflammatory M2-like macrophage phenotype.

Most often, the identified pathogenic mutations result in loss-of-function or missense changes. However, assessing the pathogenicity of noncoding variants can be challenging. Here, we characterize two unrelated patients with a distinct presentation of dyserythropoietic anemia and other impairments in hematopoiesis associated with an intronic mutation in GATA1 that is 24 nucleotides upstream of the canonical splice acceptor site. Functional studies demonstrate that this single-nucleotide alteration leads to reduced canonical splicing and increased use of an alternative splice acceptor site that causes a partial intron retention event. The resultant altered GATA1 contains a five-amino acid insertion at the C-terminus of the C-terminal zinc finger and has no observable activity. Collectively, our results demonstrate how altered splicing of GATA1, which reduces levels of the normal form of this master transcription factor, can result in distinct changes in human hematopoiesis.",A Review of Statutes and the Role of the Forensic Psychiatrist in Cyberstalking Involving Youth.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30914437,The journal of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law,2019 06 11,"Adolescents are increasingly exposed to Internet-facilitated crime as they spend more time online. The mental health risks and legal consequences for youth involved in cyberstalking are growing areas of concern. The nature of online stalking presents several challenges regarding investigation, fair adjudication, fact-finding, and legislation. Laws governing online stalking behaviors inconsistently reference the age of a victim or perpetrator as a factor for consideration in case disposition. During adjudication, the forensic psychiatrist may be asked to evaluate the victim or perpetrator involved in cyberstalking. This article focuses on the current legal landscape governing cyberstalking behavior involving adolescents, the roles a forensic psychiatrist may assume in this context, and the opportunity to bring a developmental perspective to these cases.",Inhibition of Sodium Glucose Cotransporter 2 Attenuates the Dysregulation of Kelch-Like 3 and NaCl Cotransporter in Obese Diabetic Mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30914436,Journal of the American Society of Nephrology : JASN,2019 05 07,"Mechanisms underlying the frequent association between salt-sensitive hypertension and type 2 diabetes remain obscure.

However, the degree of immune cell infiltration varies widely, and molecular features contributing to this variability remain unknown.Experimental Design: We hypothesized that genomic signatures might predict immunogenicity in BRCA1/2 breast cancers. Using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) genomic data, we compared breast cancers with (89) and without (770) either germline or somatic BRCA1/2 alterations. We also studied 35 breast cancers with germline BRCA1/2 mutations from Penn using WES and IHC.Results: We found that homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) scores were negatively associated with expression-based immune indices [cytolytic index (P = 0.04), immune ESTIMATE (P = 0.002), type II IFN signaling (P = 0.002)] despite being associated with a higher mutational/neoantigen burden, in BRCA1/2 mutant breast cancers. Further, absence of allele-specific loss of heterozygosity (LOH negative; P = 0.01) or subclonality (P = 0.003) of germline and somatic BRCA1/2 mutations, respectively, predicted for heightened cytolytic activity. Gene set analysis found that multiple innate and adaptive immune pathways that converge on NF-κB may contribute to this heightened immunogenicity. IHC of Penn breast cancers demonstrated increased CD45+ (P = 0.039) and CD8+ infiltrates (P = 0.037) and increased PDL1 expression (P = 0.012) in HRD-low or LOH-negative cancers. Triple-negative cancers with low HRD had far greater CD8+ T cells (P = 0.0011) and Perforin 1 expression (P = 0.014) compared with hormone receptor-positive HRD-high cancers.Conclusions: HRD scores and hormone receptor subtype are predictive of immunogenicity in BRCA1/2 breast cancers and may inform the design of optimal immune therapeutic strategies."

Unsaturation is essential for the stability and for the function of mitochondrial CL. Surprisingly, we found tetrapalmitoyl-CL (TPCL), a fully saturated species, in the testes of humans and mice. TPCL was absent from other mouse tissues but was the most abundant CL species in testicular germ cells. Most intriguingly, TPCL was not localized in mitochondria but was in other cellular membranes even though mitochondrial CL was the substrate from which TPCL was synthesized. During spermiogenesis, TPCL became associated with the acrosome, a sperm-specific organelle, along with a subset of authentic mitochondrial proteins, including Ant4, Suox, and Spata18. Our data suggest that mitochondria-derived membranes are assembled into the acrosome, challenging the concept that this organelle is strictly derived from the Golgi apparatus and revealing a novel function of mitochondria.",Homeostatic scaling of active zone scaffolds maintains global synaptic strength.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30914419,The Journal of cell biology,2019 06 10,"Synaptic terminals grow and retract throughout life, yet synaptic strength is maintained within stable physiological ranges.

Although active zone (AZ) number is doubled in endo mutants, a compensatory reduction in their size homeostatically adjusts global neurotransmitter output to maintain synaptic strength. We find an inverse adaptation in rab3 mutants. Additional analyses using confocal, STED, and electron microscopy reveal a stoichiometric tuning of AZ scaffolds and nanoarchitecture. Axonal transport of synaptic cargo via the lysosomal kinesin adapter Arl8 regulates AZ abundance to modulate global synaptic output and sustain the homeostatic potentiation of neurotransmission. Finally, we find that this AZ scaling can interface with two independent homeostats, depression and potentiation, to remodel AZ structure and function, demonstrating a robust balancing of separate homeostatic adaptations.

We show a crucial role for the Brahma SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, including the actin-related BAP55 subunit, in conferring enhancer accessibility and enabling the transcriptional response to Notch activity. The Notch-responsive regions have high levels of nucleosome turnover which depend on the Brahma complex, increase in magnitude with Notch signaling, and primarily involve histone H3.3.

T helper17 cells (Th17) play an important role in GIDs through production of IL-17A, IL-17F, and IL-22 cytokines. Because of their increased activities in GID, Th17 and its inflammatory cytokines can inhibit the progression and eliminate the infection. Actually, although Th17 have the best performance in the acute phase, regulatory T cells (Treg cells) are enhanced in the chronic phase and infection progress through its suppressive function. In addition, Treg cells prevent undesirable inflammatory damages developed by immune system components. On the other hand, miRNAs have important roles in the regulation of immune responses to eliminate bacterial infections and protect host organisms from harmful effects. Actually, miRNAs can reinforce innate and adaptive immunity to remove infections. Of note, miRNAs can develop a regulatory network with the immune system. Additionally, miRNAs can also serve in favor of bacteria to reduce immune responses. Therefore, balance of immune responses in Treg and Th17 cells can influence outcome of many infectious diseases.

Prioritization of 74 drug targets revealed that 42 of them were enzymes which included 29 new targets and seven chokepoint enzymes. Twenty (out of 74) potential targets are proposed as hub genes through interactome analysis and explored their significance in survival of the pathogen. Comparative analysis of 20 hub genes represents that 15 are enzymes and five are non-enzymes. Functional annotation of two chokepoint hub enzymes namely, peptidoglycan bridge formation alanyltransferase MurN (fibB) and PTS mannitol transporter subunit IIA (mltF) were significantly enriched in peptidoglycan biosynthesis and phosphotransferase system (PTS) respectively. Therefore these enzymes would be of prior interest for rational design of targeted therapy against bacterial pneumonia.",Modulation of midbrain neurocircuitry by intranasal insulin.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30914385,NeuroImage,2019 06 15,"Insulin modulates dopamine neuron activity in midbrain and affects processes underlying food intake behaviour, including impulsivity and reward processing. Here, we used intranasal administration and task-free functional MRI in humans to assess time- and dose-dependent effects of insulin on functional connectivity of the dopaminergic midbrain - and how these effects varied depending on systemic insulin sensitivity as measured by HOMA-IR. Specifically, we used a repeated-measures design with factors dose (placebo, 40 IU, 100 IU, 160 IU), time (7 time points during a 90 min post-intervention interval), and group (low vs. high HOMA-IR). A factorial analysis identified a three-way interaction (with whole-brain significance) with regard to functional connectivity between midbrain and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex. This interaction demonstrates that systemic insulin sensitivity modulates the temporal course and dose-dependent effects of intranasal insulin on midbrain functional connectivity. It suggests that altered insulin sensitivity may impact on dopaminergic projections of the midbrain and might underlie the dysregulation of reward-related and motivational behaviour in obesity and diabetes. Perhaps most importantly, the time courses of midbrain functional connectivity we present may provide useful guidance for the design of future human studies that utilize intranasal insulin administration.",Distinct neuronal entrainment to beat and meter: Revealed by simultaneous EEG-fMRI.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30914384,NeuroImage,2019 06 15,"Rhythm perception refers to the mental interpretation of rhythm by a listener. Musical rhythm perception typically involves two steps: beat extraction and metrical structure assignment (meter perception). The entrainment theories propose that different neuronal oscillations entrain to different levels of metrical structure in the rhythm (e.g., beat and meter) and thereby form a representation of the rhythm in the mind. Thus, neuronal populations that entrain to beat and meter should theoretically be different. However, although entrainment theories have been supported by many studies, the neuronal populations that entrain to beat and meter remain largely unknown. In this study, we used a paradigm to induce neuronal entrainment to beat and meter and obtained images of the neuronal populations with an electroencephalogram functional magnetic resonance imaging (EEG-fMRI) fusion method. We observed that some neuronal populations, including the bilateral putamen, bilateral caudate, left thalamus, and supplementary motor area (SMA), entrain to both beat and meter. We also observed that the bilateral putamen entrains more to meter and the SMA entrains more to beat. Our results suggest that the bilateral putamen plays an important role in meter perception.",Intergroup empathy: Enhanced neural resonance for ingroup facial emotion in a shared neural production-perception network.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30914383,NeuroImage,2019 06 15,"Empathic behavior and related neural processing are strongly modified by group membership.

Large-scale production of PHBV is still hindered by the high production cost. CRISPR/Cas9 method was used to engineer the TCA cycle in Halomonas bluephagenesis on its chromosome for production of PHBV from glucose as a sole carbon source. Two TCA cycle related genes sdhE and icl encoding succinate dehydrogenase assembly factor 2 and isocitrate lysase were deleted, respectively, in H. bluephagenesis TD08AB containing PHBV synthesis genes on the chromosome, to channel more flux to increase the 3-hydroxyvalerate (3HV) ratio of PHBV. Due to a poor growth behavior of the mutant strains, H. bluephagenesis TY194 equipped with a medium strength Pporin-194 promoter was selected for further studies. The sdhE and/or icl mutant strains of H. bluephagenesis TY194 were constructed to show enhanced cell growth, PHBV synthesis and 3HV molar ratio. Gluconate was used to activate ED pathway and thus TCA cycle to increase 3HV content. H. bluephagenesis TY194 (ΔsdhEΔicl) was found to synthesize 17mol% 3HV in PHBV. Supported by the synergetic function of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase and Vitreoscilla hemoglobin encoded by genes ppc and vgb inserted into the chromosome of H. bluephagenesis TY194 (ΔsdhE) serving to enhance TCA cycle activity, a series of strains were generated that could produce PHBV containing 3-18mol% 3HV using glucose as a sole carbon source. Shake flask studies showed that H. bluephagenesis TY194 (ΔsdhE, G7::Pporin-ppc) produced 6.3 g/L cell dry weight (CDW), 65% PHBV in CDW and 25mol% 3HV in PHBV when grown in glucose and gluconate. 25mol% 3HV was the highest reported via chromosomal expression system. PHBV copolymers with different 3HV molar ratios were extracted and characterized. Next-generation industrial biotechnology (NGIB) based on recombinant H. bluephagenesis grown under unsterile and continuous conditions, allows production of P(3HB-0∼25mol% 3HV) in a convenient way with reduced production complexity and cost."

We have previously demonstrated the macrophage-stimulating properties of polysaccharides derived from fermented barley. In this study, three polysaccharide fractions (BF-I-III) were purified from fermented barley and their monosaccharide composition was analyzed. Their immune-stimulatory activities and intracellular signaling pathways were also studied in RAW264.7 cells. Among the three fractions, BF-I exhibited enhanced macrophage activation properties, such as inducing the production of IL-6, IL-12, and TNF-α. However, BF-II and BF-III showed moderate effects on RAW 264.7 cells. BF-I treatment led to the phosphorylation of MAPKs, NF-κB, and c-Jun (major component of AP-1 transcription factor) and induced the nuclear translocation of p65 in RAW264.7 cells. In addition, experiments with neutralizing antibodies showed that Dectin-1, toll-like receptor (TLR) 4, scavenge receptor (SR), and CD14 were mainly involved in the stimulation of nitric oxide (NO) production by BF-I which was suppressed by the inhibition of JNK phosphorylation. These findings suggest that BF-I, isolated from fermented barley, has an immune potentiation activity on macrophages, where it activates the JNK signaling pathway via several macrophage receptors including dectin-1, TLR4, SR, and CD14.",Preparation of epoxy resins derived from lignin solubilized in tetrabutylphosphonium hydroxide aqueous solutions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30914367,International journal of biological macromolecules,2019 05 21,"Organic onium hydroxide aqueous solutions (OHAS) are demonstrated to be potential solvents for the dissolution of lignin and its epoxidation. A series of OHAS has been assessed in terms of the solubility of soda lignin (SL) and Klason lignin (KL), which are moderately and rarely soluble in NaOH aq. soln., respectively. Tetrabutylphosphonium hydroxide ([P4444]OH) aqueous solution was found to exhibit a highest solubility, specifically 40 wt% of SL and 3.0 wt% of KL. The superior solubility of OHAS is comprehended to be due to weak interactions between OH anions and phosphonium cations, and hence OH anions interact effectively with lignin. Epoxidation of SL was achieved by simply adding epichlorohydrin to [P4444]OH aq. dissolving SL. Films of epoxidized SL were prepared by thermal curing with the aid of a crosslinking agent, and the films were found to possess high thermal stability of >250 °C and excellent ductility.

The prepared polymer films have been characterized with swelling index, solubility based biodegradability, gel fraction, mechanical strength, water vapor transmission rate and antimicrobial effectiveness. The optimized film (composition) were analyzed to possess excellent swelling (260.5 ± 2.9%) and in-vitro degradation (45.5 ± 1.8-59.8 ± 0.4% degradation, during 14 days) characteristics. Further, the film possesses enhanced combinations of water vapor transmission rate and antibacterial activity with Gram-negative (Escherichia coli) and Gram-positive (Listeria monocytogenes) bacteria.

As a member of the subfamily, its cap-open conformation is expected for substrate binding. We determined apo and PLP-bound PLPP/chronophin structures showing a cap-closed conformation. The active site, in which a PLP molecule was found, is too small to accommodate a phospho-cofilin peptide, the substrate of chronophin. A conformational change to a cap-open conformation may be required for substrate binding. The core and cap domains are joined through linker peptide hinges that change conformation to open the active site. The crystal structures reveal that a disulphide bond between the cap and core domains restricts the hinge motion. The enzyme displays PLP dephosphorylation activity in the cap-closed conformation with the disulphide bond and even in the crystal state, in which repositioning of the cap and core domains is restricted. Structural analysis suggests that a small substrate such as PLP can bind to the active site through a small movement of a local motif. However, a change to the cap-open conformation is required for binding of larger substrates such as phosphopeptides to the active site.",Development of biodegradable semiconducting foam based on micro-fibrillated cellulose/Cu-NPs.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30914362,International journal of biological macromolecules,2019 05 21,"In this work regenerated cellulose was prepared by phosphoric acid as a primarily step in preparation of biodegradable foam.

The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed the presence of individual chunky regenerated cellulose fibers in the dimensions of micro that enhanced tendency to aggregate during drying. X-ray diffraction (XRD) demonstrated that, the treatment of cellulose with concentrated phosphoric acid led to defibrated cellulose with lower crystallinity index than original cellulose fibers. The study provided insights about the influence of the Cu-NPs on the structure, thermal stability and the electrical contributions of the considered cellulose-based foam. The electrical and dielectric properties were studied by means of the broadband dielectric spectroscopy. The dielectric spectra were dominated by an anomalous behavior of the permittivity as illustrated versus frequency of the investigated samples. The real part of conductivity follows the universal power law at higher frequencies. The foam loaded Cu-NPs exhibit biodegradability and highly efficient antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Candida albicans.","Preparation, preliminary pharmacokinetic and brain targeting study of metformin encapsulated W/O/W composite submicron emulsions promoted by borneol.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30914361,European journal of pharmaceutical sciences : official journal of the European Federation for Pharmaceutical Sciences,2019 04 24,"Metformin hydrochloride (Met) is the first-line drug to treat type 2 diabetes and has shown high efficiency in reducing Alzheimer's disease in recent studies.

In the optimized formulation, the mean droplets size, polydispersity index and encapsulation efficiency of the composite were 386.5 nm, 0.219 and 87.26%, respectively. FTIR analysis confirmed that Met interacted with carriers in B-Met-W/O/W SE. Compared with Met free drug, in-vitro release of Met in B-Met-W/O/W SE delivery system was much slower.

However, the toxicity of cationic lipids is still an obstacle to application. To develop low toxicity cationic lipids, we designed two cationic lipids contained different number of hydroxyl groups. Biocompatible mono-hydroxyl and multi-hydroxyl galactose head group was respectively modified to a biodegradable quaternary amine lipid, and two novel hydroxyl cationic lipids were synthesized and characterized by MS, 1H NMR and 13C NMR. Two lipids showed good surface activity and both of them can assemble to about 80 nm stable small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs) with cholesterol in aqueous phase. Both of lipids showed relatively lower toxicity than the well-known cationic lipid 1,2-dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium-propane (DOTAP). In vitro 24 h IC50 of two assemblies were more than 50 μg/mL, which were about 10 μg/mL higher than the IC50 of DOTAP. Multi-hydroxyl galactose lipids group showed much lower toxicity than mono-hydroxyl lipids group. Moreover, Both of the assemblies with lower hemolysis were nearly non-hemolytic risk under the concentration of 30 μg/mL. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and dynamic light scattering (DLS) showed that the average sizes of both doxorubicin (DOX) loaded liposomes were about 110 nm. The DOX entrapment efficiencies of galactose liposome and mono-hydroxyl liposome were 58% and 91%, respectively. Both of the DOX loaded liposomes were stable after one month placed at room temperature. Two DOX loaded liposomes showed better anti-cancer effect than free DOX above 5 μg/mL, and they can be internalized into cells and produce more release of DOX inside MCF-7 cells and HepG2 cells at pH 5.0.

The computer program pDISOL-X was used to design the structured experiments (pH-RSF method), to process the data, and to refine the equilibrium constants. Low-to-high and high-to-low pH assays (using HCl, H3PO4, or NaOH to adjust pH) were performed on phosphate-buffered (0.12‑0.15 M) saturated solutions of DsHCl in the pH 1.3-11.6 range. After equilibration (stirring 6 h, followed by 18 h stir-free sedimentation), filtration or centrifugation was used for phase separation. Concentration was measured using HPLC with UV/VIS detection. The 2:1 drug-phosphate solubility product (Ksp2:1 = [DsH+]2[HPO42-]) was determined from data in the pH 4-9 region. The free base of desipramine was prepared and used to determine the Ksp1:1 ([DsH+][H2PO4-]) in chloride-free acidified suspension. In addition, phosphate-free titrations were conducted to determine the intrinsic solubility, S0, and the 1:1 drug-chloride solubility product, KspDsHCl = [DsH+][Cl-].

Oils mixed with solids were observed to form in alkaline solutions (pH > 11). Notably, soluble drug-phosphate complexes appeared to form below pH 3.9 and above pHmax in saturated phosphate‑containing saline solutions. This was indicated by the systematic pH shift to higher values in the log S-pH curve in alkaline solution than expected from the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. For pH < 3.9, saturated phosphate-containing saline solutions exhibited elevated solubility, with drug-hydrochloride as the sole precipitate.

Their structures were elucidated on the basis of extensive spectroscopic analysis. The purification was cytotoxicity-guided which indicated the extract, fractions and compounds were evaluated in vitro for anti-proliferative activity against a panel of human cancer cell lines. The results showed compounds 1 and 2 with moderate cytotoxicity while 3 was inactive, which suggested -NH2 group might play a very important role for their cytotoxicity.

It is available as a food supplement in the market and has physiological health effects. Quercetin has anti-inflammatory, anticancer and anti-prostate activities along with its beneficial effects on high cholesterol, kidney transplantation, asthma, diabetes, viral infections, pulmonary, schizophrenia and cardiovascular diseases. Quercetin possesses scavenging potential of hydroxyl radical (OH-), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and superoxide anion (O2-). These reactive oxygen species (ROS) hampers lipid, protein, amino acids and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) processing leading to epigenetic alterations. Quercetin has the ability to combat these harmful effects. ROS plays a vital role in the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and we propose that quercetin would be the best choice to overcome cellular and molecular signals in regulating normal physiological functions. However, data are not well documented regarding exact cellular mechanisms of quercetin. The neuroprotective effects of quercetin are mainly due to potential up- and/or down-regulation of cytokines via nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2), Paraoxonase-2, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), Protein kinase C, Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling cascades, and PI3K/Akt pathways. Therefore, the aim of the present review was to elaborate on the cellular and molecular mechanisms of the quercetin involved in the protection against AD.",Oscillating flow promotes inflammation through the TLR2-TAK1-IKK2 signalling pathway in human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVECs).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30914314,Life sciences,2019 05 20,"Oscillatory shear stress (OSS) occurs in areas where atherosclerosis is prevalent.

Gene therapy enables the targeted delivery of DNA to cell nuclei, and recombinant adeno-associated viral (rAAV) vectors have been identified as suitable tools for stable overexpression. Thus, to explore the effects of long-term expression of NPS, the present study examined anxiety- and depressive-like effects after rAAV-mediated NPS overexpression in the rat amygdala. Compared to rats injected with an empty control vector (rAAV-Empty), rAAV-NPS treatment was associated with reduced anxiety-like behavior in the elevated plus maze and light-dark box, but did not affect depressive-like behavior in the forced swim test. Importantly, rAAV-NPS did not cause confounding effects on locomotion or bodyweight as opposed to currently used anxiolytic drugs. Immunohistochemical stainings revealed NPS-positive cells in the central and basolateral region of the amygdala in rAAV-NPS but not rAAV-Empty rats, indicating successful transduction. Our study provides novel evidence for sustained anxiolytic-like properties of NPS by transgenic overexpression. These data suggest that rAAV-NPS application deserves further attention as a potential treatment strategy for anxiety in humans.","Response control correlates of anomalous basal ganglia morphology in boys, but not girls, with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30914308,Behavioural brain research,2019 06 10,"Anomalous basal ganglia morphology may contribute to deficient motor response control in children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). This study expands upon recent evidence of sex differences in subcortical morphology and motor response control deficits among children with ADHD to examine basal ganglia volume and shape in relation to motor response control. Participants included 8-12 year-old children with ADHD (n = 52, 21 girls) and typically developing (TD) controls (n = 45, 19 girls). High resolution T1-weighted 3D MPRAGE images covering the whole brain were acquired for all participants on a 3 T scanner. Participants performed two computer-based go/no-go tasks that differed in the extent to which working memory was necessary to guide response selection. Shape-based morphometric analyses were performed in addition to traditional volumetric comparisons and correlations with measures of motor response control were examined. Boys with ADHD consistently demonstrated increased commission error rate and response variability, regardless of task demands, suggesting broad response control deficits. In contrast, response control deficits among girls with ADHD varied depending on task demands and performance measures. Volumetric reductions and inward deformation (compression) on the dorsal surface of the globus pallidus and within subregions of the putamen receiving projections from limbic, executive and motor cortices were observed in boys, but not girls, with ADHD relative to TD children. Mediation analyses revealed that putamen and globus pallidus volumes mediated the relationship between diagnosis and commission error rate. Furthermore, reduced volumes of these structures and localized inward deformation within executive and motor circuits correlated with poorer response control, particularly under conditions of increased cognitive load. These findings suggest that anomalous basal ganglia morphology is related to impaired motor response control among boys with ADHD.",MGluR5 activity is required for the induction of ethanol behavioral sensitization and associated changes in ERK MAP kinase phosphorylation in the nucleus accumbens shell and lateral habenula.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30914307,Behavioural brain research,2019 04 26,"Metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype-5 (mGluR5) activity regulates a variety of behavioral pathologies associated with alcohol addiction. The main goal of this study was to determine if mGluR5 regulates the induction of ethanol-induced locomotor sensitization, which is a model of experience-dependent plasticity following initial exposure to drugs of abuse. The extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2) pathway is downstream of mGluR5 and implicated in alcohol addiction; however, its role in sensitization remains unexplored. We sought to determine if mGluR5-mediated changes in ethanol-induced sensitization are associated with changes in ERK1/2 phosphorylation (pERK1/2) in specific brain regions. Adult male DBA/2 J mice were tested for acute locomotor response to ethanol (0 or 2 g/kg, IP) followed by a 9-day induction period in which the mGluR5 antagonist MPEP (0 or 30 mg/kg, IP) was administered prior to ethanol (0 or 2.5 g/kg, IP). One day later, ethanol (2 g/kg) produced a robust within- and between-group increase in locomotor activity, indicating sensitization in mice that received MPEP (0 mg/kg) during induction. MPEP (30 mg/kg) treatment during induction resulted in locomotor response to ethanol (2 g/kg) challenge that was equivalent to an acute response, indicating full blockade of sensitization. Sensitization was associated with increased pERK1/2 immunoreactivity (IR) in nucleus accumbens shell (AcbSh) and a reduction in lateral habenula (LHb), both of which were blocked by MPEP treatment during induction. Sensitization was also associated with mGluR5-independent increases in pERK1/2 IR in the nucleus accumbens core and decreases in the dentate gyrus and lateral septum. These data indicate that mGluR5 activity is required for the induction of ethanol locomotor sensitization and associated changes in ERK1/2 phosphorylation in the AcbSh and LHb, which raises the hypothesis that mGluR5-mediated cell signaling in these brain regions may mediate the induction of sensitization. Elucidating mechanisms of sensitization may increase understanding of how ethanol hijacks behavioral functions during the development of addiction.",Astroglial monoacylglycerol lipase controls mutant huntingtin-induced damage of striatal neurons.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30914306,Neuropharmacology,2019 05 21,"Cannabinoids exert neuroprotection in a wide array of preclinical models. A number of these studies has focused on cannabinoid CB1 receptors in striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs) and the most characteristic MSN-degenerative disease, Huntington's disease (HD). Accruing evidence supports that astrocytes contribute to drive HD progression, and that they express CB1 receptors, degrade endocannabinoids, and modulate endocannabinergic transmission. However, the possible role of the astroglial endocannabinoid system in controlling MSN integrity remains unknown. Here, we show that JZL-184, a selective inhibitor of monoacylglycerol lipase (MGL), the key enzyme that deactivates the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol, prevented the mutant huntingtin-induced up-regulation of the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-α in primary mouse striatal astrocytes via CB1 receptors. To study the role of astroglial MGL in vivo, we injected stereotactically into the mouse dorsal striatum viral vectors that encode mutant or normal huntingtin under the control of the glial fibrillary acidic protein promoter. We observed that, in wild-type mice, pharmacological blockade of MGL with JZL-184 (8 mg/kg/day, i.p.) conferred neuroprotection against mutant huntingtin-induced striatal damage, as evidenced by the prevention of MSN loss, astrogliosis, and motor coordination impairment. We next found that conditional mutant mice bearing a genetic deletion of MGL selectively in astroglial cells (MGLfloxed/floxed;GFAP-Cre/+ mice) were resistant to mutant huntingtin-induced MSN loss, astrogliosis, and motor coordination impairment. Taken together, these data support that astroglial MGL controls the availability of a 2-arachidonoylglycerol pool that ensues protection of MSNs in the mouse striatum in vivo, thus providing a potential druggable target for reducing striatal neurodegeneration.",Mechanisms underpinning AMP-activated protein kinase-related effects on behavior and hippocampal neurogenesis in an animal model of depression.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30914305,Neuropharmacology,2019 05 21,"Adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is critical for whole-body energy metabolism regulation. Recent studies have suggested that physical exercise ameliorates depressive-like behaviors via AMPK activation; however, the underlying mechanism is unclear. Here, we examined the effects and underlying mechanisms of AMPK activation on depressive-like behavior in olfactory bulbectomized (OBX) mice. We treated OBX mice with the AMPK activator, 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-β-d-ribonucleotide (AICAR) on the 7th or 14th day after bilateral bulbectomy and evaluated depressive-like behavior using the tail-suspension test (TST) and forced swimming test (FST) on the 21st day. The expression of phosphorylated AMPK, protein kinase C ζ (PKCζ), nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) in the hippocampus was assessed by western blotting. Hippocampal neurogenesis and localization of AMPK and phosphorylated NF-κB were examined by immunohistochemistry. Chronic AICAR treatment suppressed the prolonged immobility of OBX mice in the TST and FST, and increased the levels of phosphorylated AMPK, PKCζ, NF-κB, CREB, and BDNF. Hippocampal neurogenesis in OBX mice was promoted by chronic AICAR treatment. Co-administration of AICAR with the PKCζ inhibitor or the neurotrophic tyrosine kinase receptor type 2 (TrkB) antagonist, ANA-12, inhibited these effects. Phosphorylated AMPK was detected in mature and immature hippocampal neurons and microglia, while phosphorylated NF-κB was detected only in neurons in AICAR-treated OBX mice. These data indicate that AMPK activation produces anti-depressant effects, which are mediated by elevated hippocampal neurogenesis potentially via PKCζ/NF-κB/BDNF/TrkB/CREB signaling in neurons."

Using two chimeric single-span proteins containing a designed hydrophobic segment H, we have determined the requirements for SecA-mediated secretion, the molecular distinction between TM domains and signal peptides, and the propensity for hydrophobic H-segments to remain embedded within the bilayer after targeting. By means of engineered H-segments and a strategically placed SPase I cleavage site, we determined how targeting and stability of the chimeric proteins are affected by the length and hydrophobicity of the H-segment. Very hydrophobic segments (e.g., 16 Leu) are stably incorporated into the inner membrane, resulting in a C-terminal anchored membrane protein, while a 24L construct was not targeted to the membrane by SecA and remained in the cytoplasm. However, a construct carrying preMalE at the N-terminus led to SecA targeting to SecYEG via the native signal sequence and stable insertion of the downstream 24L H-segment. We show that the RseP intramembrane protease degrades weakly stable H-segments and is a useful tool for investigating the borderline between stable and unstable TM segments. Using RseP- cells, we find that moderately hydrophobic sequences (e.g., 5Leu + 11Ala) are targeted to SecYEG by SecA and inserted, but subsequently drop out of the membrane into the cytoplasm. Therefore, the free energy of transfer from translocon to bilayer is different from the transfer free energy from membrane to water.",The Many Facets of the Small Non-coding RNA RsaE (RoxS) in Metabolic Niche Adaptation of Gram-Positive Bacteria.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30914292,Journal of molecular biology,2019 04 12,"Small regulatory RNAs (sRNAs) are increasingly recognized as players in the complex regulatory networks governing bacterial gene expression. RsaE (synonym RoxS) is an sRNA that is highly conserved in bacteria of the Bacillales order. Recent analyses in Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis identified RsaE/RoxS as a potent riboregulator of central carbon metabolism and energy balance with many molecular RsaE/RoxS functions and targets being shared across species. Similarities and species-specific differences in cellular processes modulated by RsaE/RoxS suggest that this sRNA plays a prominent role in the adaptation of Gram-positive bacteria to niches with varying nutrient availabilities and environmental cues. This review summarizes recent findings on the molecular function of RsaE/RoxS and its interaction with mRNA targets. Special emphasis will be on the integration of RsaE/RoxS into metabolic regulatory circuits and, derived from this, the role of RsaE/RoxS as a putative driver to generate phenotypic heterogeneity in bacterial populations. In this respect, we will particularly discuss heterogeneous RsaE expression in S. epidermidis biofilms and its possible contribution to metabolic niche diversification, programmed bacterial lysis and biofilm matrix production.",RNA Sequence Features Are at the Core of Influenza A Virus Genome Packaging.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30914291,Journal of molecular biology,2019 04 05,"The influenza A virus (IAV), a respiratory pathogen for humans, poses serious medical and economic challenges to global healthcare systems.

We scientifically evaluated BMI with respect to sizing and counting accuracy, working range, impact of refractive index, and interferences by silicone oil droplets, and compared BMI to state-of-the-art dynamic image analysis (DIA). Image quality was found to be comparable to current DIA methodologies. However, with the first versions of BMI image analysis software, an undersizing of polystyrene beads was observed. BMI linear concentration range was found to reach an upper limit (7.1 × 105 particles/mL) similar to DIA. In the absence of silicone oil droplets, BMI and DIA showed good agreement in total particle concentrations (particle diameter ≥2 μm) but differences in size distributions for particle sizes ≥4 μm. Analyses of prefilled syringe products and silicone oil emulsions demonstrated the removal of silicone oil in BMI sample processing. In contrast to DIA, particle counting by BMI remained unaffected by changes in refractive index. Overall, we demonstrated BMI to be a promising orthogonal method for subvisible particle characterization. Aspects like low required sample volume, high throughput, and ease of handling can make BMI a valuable alternative or complement to DIA in particular for formulation screening.",Preparation and Characterization of Cellulose Ether Liposomes for the Inhibition of Prion Formation in Prion-Infected Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30914271,Journal of pharmaceutical sciences,2019 04 17,"Prion accumulation in the brain and lymphoreticular system causes fatal neurodegenerative diseases. Our previous study revealed that cellulose ethers (CE) have anti-prion activities in vivo and in prion-infected cells when administered at high doses.

The liposomal formulation reduced the EC50 dose of CE by <1/200-fold in prion-infected cells. Compared to empty liposomes, CE-loaded liposomes were taken up much more highly by prion-infected cells and less by macrophage-like cells. Phosphatidylserine modification reduced the uptake of CE-loaded liposomes in prion-infected cells and did not change the anti-prion activity, whereas increased the uptake in macrophage-like cells. Polyethylene glycol modification reduced the uptake of CE-loaded liposomes in both types of cells and reduced the anti-prion activity in prion-infected cells. These results suggest that a liposomal formulation of CE is more practical than unformulated CE and showed that the CE-loaded liposome uptake levels in prion-infected cells were not associated with anti-prion activity. Although further improvement of the stealth function against phagocytic cells is needed, the liposomal formulation is useful to improve CE efficacy and elucidate the mechanism of CE action.",Eight-color panel for immune phenotype monitoring by flow cytometry.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30914269,Journal of immunological methods,2019 04 05,"Flow cytometry (FC) is a fast and highly informative technology that has gained prominence in immune phenotype monitoring. FC standardization is crucial to obtain reliable results that are comparable among laboratories and immune monitoring studies, as this method is influenced by several variables, including equipment, reagents, staining procedures, and pre-analytical and analytical factors. Recent studies have standardized antibody panels and analytical procedures to analyze circulating immune cells in peripheral blood (PB). However, these panels cannot be adapted for laboratories that perform eight-color FC with liquid reagents. The aim of this study was to design and test an eight-color panel, intended to phenotype the main immune cell subsets in PB using liquid reagents and fresh whole blood samples. Samples were collected from healthy individuals recruited from staff and students and from six chemotherapy patients with leukopenia. The antibody panel was designed on the basis of previous studies. Quality controls comprised antibody titration, fluorescence minus one controls, internal controls, and compensation controls. Samples were analyzed by two operators using an eight-color three-laser FACSCanto II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, USA) and Infinicyt software (Cytognos, Spain). The proposed eight-color panel is composed of six tubes. Analysis of these tubes allowed evaluation of frequencies and classification of various immune cells, such as naïve T, central memory T, effector memory T, CDRA+ effector memory T, activated T, and regulatory T cells; class-switched B, non-switched B, memory B, regulatory B cells, and plasmablasts; myeloid and plasmacytoid dendritic cells, classical and non-classical monocytes; and immature neutrophils. Immunophenotyping of leukocytes using the proposed panel was efficient to correctly differentiate the majority of immune cell subtypes. It is a promising tool to determine the immunological profile of patients in clinical trials and establish associations with disease prognosis, complications, and outcomes.",A randomised controlled trial of matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDITOF-MS) versus conventional microbiological methods for identifying pathogens: Impact on optimal antimicrobial therapy of invasive bacterial and fungal infections in Vietnam.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30914268,The Journal of infection,2019 06 10,We assessed the impact of MALDITOF-MS on the timeliness of optimal antimicrobial therapy through a parallel-arm randomised controlled trial in two hospitals in Vietnam.,Macrophage p38α promotes nutritional steatohepatitis through M1 polarization.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30914267,Journal of hepatology,2019 05 07,"p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases are important inflammatory factors. p38α alteration has been implicated in both human and mouse inflammatory disease models.

However, the disease remains incurable, since it establishes latent proviral reservoirs, which in turn can stochastically begin reproducing viral particles throughout the patient's lifetime. Viral latency itself depends in large part on the silencing environment of the infected host cell, which can be chemically manipulated. ""Shock and kill"" therapy intends to reverse proviral quiescence by inducing transcription with pharmaceuticals and allowing a combination of antiretroviral therapy, host immune clearance and HIV-cytolysis to remove latently infected cells, leading to a complete cure. Over 160 compounds functioning as latency-reversing agents (LRAs) have been identified to date, but none of the candidates has yet led to a promising functional cure. Furthermore, fundamental bioinformatic and clinical research from the past decade has highlighted the complexity and highly heterogeneous nature of the proviral reservoirs, shedding doubt on the ""shock and kill"" concept. Alternative therapies such as the HIV transcription-inhibiting ""block and lock"" strategy are therefore being considered. In this review we describe the variety of existing classes of LRAs, discuss their current drawbacks and highlight the potential for combinatorial ""shocktail"" therapies for potent proviral reactivation. We also suggest investigating LRAs with lesser-known mechanisms of action, and examine the feasibility of ""block and lock"" therapy.",Efficacy of a new topical formulation of selamectin plus sarolaner for the control of fleas and ticks infesting cats in Japan.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30914264,Veterinary parasitology,2019 06 16,"The efficacy of a single application of a new topical formulation containing selamectin plus sarolaner (Revolution® Plus / Stronghold® Plus, Zoetis) was evaluated against fleas and ticks infesting cats enrolled as veterinary patients in two field studies conducted in Japan and against Haemaphysalis longicornis ticks on cats in a laboratory study. In the laboratory study, sixteen cats were ranked based on pre-treatment tick counts and allocated randomly to treatment on Day 0 with either selamectin plus sarolaner or placebo. Cats were infested with adult H. longicornis on Days -2, 5, 12, 19, 26 and 33. Efficacy relative to placebo was based on live attached tick counts conducted 48 h after treatment and subsequent re-infestations. Selamectin plus sarolaner reduced live, attached H. longicornis counts by 96.4% within 48 h of treatment, and by ≥91.7% within 48 h of weekly re-infestation for 35 days, based on arithmetic means. In the field studies, 67 client-owned cats harboring six or more live fleas and 63 cats harboring four or more live attached ticks were enrolled to evaluate selamectin plus sarolaner for efficacy and safety compared with a registered product. Cats were allocated randomly to treatment with selamectin plus sarolaner or fipronil plus (S)-methoprene based on order of presentation. Treatment was administered once on Day 0 and efficacy was assessed by parasite counts conducted on Days 14 and 30 compared to the pre-treatment count. In the flea field study, live flea counts on Days 14 and 30 were reduced by 99.5% and 99.9% in the selamectin plus sarolaner group, and by 97.6% and 98.6% in the fipronil plus (S)-methoprene group, based on least squares mean percentage reductions. Clinical signs typically associated with flea allergy dermatitis improved following treatment. In the tick field study, live tick counts on Days 14 and 30 were reduced by 97.5% and 97.7% in the selamectin plus sarolaner group, and by 91.5% and 93.4% in the fipronil plus (S)-methoprene group, based on least squares mean percentage reductions. Selamectin plus sarolaner was determined to be non-inferior to fipronil plus (S)-methoprene in both field studies. There were no treatment-related adverse events in any study. A single topical dose of Revolution® Plus / Stronghold® Plus providing a minimum dosage of 6.0 mg/kg selamectin and 1.0 mg/kg sarolaner was confirmed to be effective against H. longicornis ticks on cats for one month and safe and effective in the treatment of fleas and ticks on cats enrolled as veterinary patients in Japan.",Does physical activity differ between youth with and without intellectual disabilities?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30914263,Disability and health journal,2019 03 27,"Children and youth with intellectual disabilities (ID) are known to face obstacles to physical activity participation, yet the activity patterns of this population are not well characterized.","Developmental dyslexia: A deficit in magnocellular-parvocellular co-activation, not simply in pure magnocellular activation.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30914259,Vision research,2019 05 26,"The magnocellular deficit theory of dyslexia suggests a selective impairment in contrast detection of stimuli involving pure magnocellular response (e.g. Gabor patches of 0.5 c/deg, 30 Hz, low contrast). An alternative hypothesis is that, dyslexia may be associated with a reduction of typical facilitation that normal readers present for stimuli relying on low-level magno-parvo co-activation, relative to stimuli eliciting pure magno activation. According to this hypothesis, any advantage in contrast sensitivity, produced by either decreasing stimuli temporal frequency (from 30 to 10 Hz, Experiment 1) or using static stimuli of increasing spatial frequency (from 0.5 to 4 c/deg, Experiment 2), would be ascribed to the coexisting responses of the magnocellular and parvocellular systems. In the control group, this advantage in contrast sensitivity was found for a 0.5 c/deg Gabor (either static or flickering at 10 Hz) and for a static Gabor of 4 c/deg. In contrast to magnocellular deficit theory predictions, dyslexic individuals showed no deficit in the unmixed magnocellular response. However, they showed no advantage when the relative weight between magnocellular and parvocellular inputs was thrown off balance in favor of the latter. These results suggest that in order to interpret low-level visual deficits in dyslexia, it is worth considering that fast, feedforward low-frequency representations of spatial structures may result from the coexisting responses of two systems. Our results suggest that in dyslexia, the relative contribution of these two systems in visual processing is perturbed, and that this may have detrimental consequences in word processing, both within the parafovea and the fovea during fixation."

Inflammation also induces mitochondrial dysfunction through multiple mechanisms. Sensory nerve terminals are densely packed with mitochondria, suggesting that mitochondrial signaling may play a role in inflammation-induced nociception. We have previously shown that agents that induce mitochondrial dysfunction, such as antimycin A, activate a subset of nociceptive vagal sensory nerves that express transient receptor potential (TRP) channels ankyrin 1 (A1) and vanilloid 1 (V1). However, the mechanisms underlying these responses are incompletely understood. Here, we studied the contribution of TRPA1, TRPV1 and reactive oxygen species (ROS) to antimycin A-induced vagal sensory nerve activation in dissociated neurons and at the sensory terminals of bronchopulmonary C-fibers. Nociceptive neurons were defined chemically and genetically. Antimycin A-evoked activation of vagal nociceptors in a Fura2 Ca2+ assay correlated with TRPV1 responses compared to TRPA1 responses. Nociceptor activation was dependent on both TRP channels, with TRPV1 predominating in a majority of responding nociceptors and TRPA1 predominating only in nociceptors with the greatest responses. Surprisingly, both TRPA1 and TRPV1 were activated by H2O2 when expressed in HEK293. Nevertheless, targeting ROS had no effect of antimycin A-evoked TRPV1 activation in either HEK293 or vagal neurons. In contrast, targeting ROS inhibited antimycin A-evoked TRPA1 activation in HEK293, vagal neurons and bronchopulmonary C-fibers, and a ROS-insensitive TRPA1 mutant was completely insensitive to antimycin A. We therefore conclude that mitochondrial dysfunction activates vagal nociceptors by ROS-dependent (TRPA1) and ROS-independent (TRPV1) mechanisms.",Advancing quantitative intersectionality research methods: Intracategorical and intercategorical approaches to shared and differential constructs.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30914246,Social science & medicine (1982),2019 04 19,"A range of methods have recently been proposed for incorporating intersectionality theoretical frameworks into quantitative research methodology. We published a pair of articles on methods for intercategorical intersectionality, in which we distinguished analytic from descriptive studies, identified causal mediation decomposition methods as an appropriate strategy for analytic intercategorical intersectionality, and introduced and validated a group of three new measures of major, day-to-day, and anticipated discrimination for use in intercategorical analysis (Bauer and Scheim, 2019; Scheim and Bauer, 2019). We respond to points raised in four invited commentaries on our original pair of articles-by Evans (2019); Jackson and VanderWeele (2019); Harnois and Bastos (2019); and Richman and Zucker (2019). We discuss differential constructs, which represent those that exist only for those at particular intersections, or for which meanings vary across intersections. Whereas such constructs may be studied intracategorically, in intercategorical studies they place limits on both the types of measures that may be used and the statistical analyses that can be conducted. Most quantitative intersectionality methods work has therefore focused on intracategorical measures, but intercategorical analyses. We present a preliminary agenda for continued methods development in quantitative intersectionality methods.",Differential potential ratiometric sensing platform for enantiorecognition of chiral drugs.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30914245,Analytical biochemistry,2019 04 20,"A versatile, robust and efficient differential potential ratiometric sensing platform was developed for enantioselective recognition of dual chiral targets based on a composite membrane of molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) modified glassy carbon electrode (GCE). The functional chitosan-based MIPs and rGO were compatibly immobilized on the GCE with high selectivity and efficient signal amplification. Moreover, via the systematic optimization of series conditions, a distinct potential difference (PD), reaching 135 mV, was obtained between the R-/S-prop based on the MIPs/rGO/GCE. In a controllable concentration range from 50 μM to 1000 μM, different ratios of R-/S-prop were linearly related to the peak potentials (Eps) in the racemic mixture. Using this low-cost reversible electrochemical platform, both Prop enantiomers were simultaneously identified with high repeatability and time-based stability. This novel semi-quantitative electrochemical sensing platform was established to rapidly quantify the ratio of S-/R-prop by Ep for the chiral drug recognition with great potential for practical applications in fields of pharmacological detection and clinical analysis.","Electrochemical studies of human nAChR a7 subunit phosphorylation by kinases PKA, PKC and Src.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30914244,Analytical biochemistry,2019 04 20,"Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR) are ion channels which regulate a numerous of neurotransmitters, including acetylcholine, norepinephrine, dopamine, serotonin and glutamate. These receptors are important targets for the study of a plethora of diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, Parkinson's Disease, cancer, inflammation, etc. The α7 subunits are especially interesting in that they are commonly occurring and are critical sites of regulation. Herein we report the phosphorylation of the human nAChR α7 subunits, by the kinases PKA, PKC and Src, by both biochemical and electrochemical techniques along with the kinetics of each phosphorylation reaction. Phosphorylation was investigated through changes in current density as well as impedance and X-ray photo electron spectroscopy (XPS) and the kinetics were determined electrochemically using the surface Michaelis-Menten model.

Several papers have suggested that total protein normalization may be better than housekeeping protein normalization for Western blotting normalization. Ponceau S is the most commonly used stain for total protein normalization. A review of the literature and commercial websites suggest a multitude of Ponceau S staining protocols for total protein staining of blots. In this study, we explored which Ponceau S staining protocol would result in the highest sensitivity of protein band detection. Unexpectedly, we found that irrespective of the Ponceau S concentration (between 0.001 and 2% (w/v)), acid concentration, and acid type (acetic acid, trichloroacetic acid and/or sulfosalicylic acid), the sensitivity of protein detection remained constant. The most commonly used concentration of Ponceau S is 0.1%, while 0.001% (100-fold less) Ponceau S resulted in the same sensitivity of protein band detection. We suggest the use of the relatively inexpensive 0.01% Ponceau S in 1% acetic acid stain for total protein normalization as it is as effective as all the expensive formulations that are currently used.",Gastrointestinal effects of ivermectin treatment in rats infected with Strongyloides venezuelensis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30914242,Acta tropica,2019 04 26,"We aimed to evaluate the effects of ivermectin treatment on gastrointestinal morphology and function after Strongyloides venezuelensis infection. Male rats composed Control (C), Parasitized (Sv), Ivermectin (IVM) and Parasitized and treated with Ivermectin (Sv/IVM) groups. IVM and Sv/IVM groups were subdivided according to IVM: single dose of 200 μg/kg (IVM1 and Sv/IVM1) or three repeated doses of 200 μg/kg at 24 h intervals (IVM3 and Sv/IVM3). First dose of IVM was administered after peak of infection. Eggs per gram (EPG), mean gastric emptying time (MGET), mean cecum arrival time (MCAT) and mean small intestinal transit time (MSITT) were evaluated. Measurements were performed before drug and at peak of infection, first day post peak of infection and 30 days post infection. Same time intervals were simulated for uninfected animals. Number of recovered worms and intestinal morphometry were also rated. Data were analyzed by ANOVA and correlated by Dunnett and Pearson (p < 0.05). Sv/IVM1 and Sv/IVM3 showed reduction of EPG and worms, although only group SV/IVM3 eradicate them. Hastened gastric emptying and slowed intestinal transit provoked by S. venezuelensis infection can be reverted by a single administration of IVM after peak of infection, even without total parasite elimination. Although three consecutive doses of IVM were more efficient to eradicate the parasite, drug administration impaired gastrointestinal function and morphology. IVM alone affected gastrointestinal parameters in uninfected animals for prolonged periods, especially in high doses. In control, there were strong negative correlations between MSITT and muscle layers. Strongyloides venezuelensis infection abolishes such correlations. Longitudinal muscle was thinner in IVM3 and Sv/IVM3 groups and circular thicker in Sv group. Revisiting the action of traditional drugs broadens knowledge in the parasite-host interface and may result in the development of more accurate therapeutic strategies.",Child development center-based sentinel surveillance of soil-transmitted helminthiases in preschool-age children in selected local government units in the Philippines.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30914241,Acta tropica,2019 04 26,"Soil-transmitted helminthiasis (STH) remains a public health concern in developing countries, such as the Philippines. Preschool-age children (PSAC) are among the high-risk groups for STH. Data on the status of STH in PSAC are needed to help guide policy formulation and program implementation; however, in the usual setting, such data may remain limited. This study aimed to describe the parasitologic status of PSAC in selected local government units (LGUs) in the Philippines through sentinel surveillance methodology in a child-development center (CDC)-based setting. This cross-sectional study, which included 1732 PSAC in selected barangays (a village or the smallest administrative unit in the country) in the provinces of Cavite, Guimaras, Iloilo, Negros Occidental, and Davao del Norte and cities of Iloilo and Lapu-Lapu in the Philippines, utilized Kato-Katz technique to determine parasitologic status. A single Kato-Katz smear was prepared from the adult-thumb sized stool sample submitted by each participant. Ten percent of Kato-Katz slides examined by field microscopists were re-examined by a reference microscopist as part of quality control. Results showed a prevalence of any STH infection and a moderate-heavy ((M-H)) intensity prevalence of 24.9% and 10.3%, respectively. Five cases of schistosomiasis were found in Lapu-Lapu City and Davao del Norte. While the Philippines' Department of Health (DOH) - Integrated Helminth Control Program (IHCP) target for prevalence of any STH of less than 50% was attained, none of the barangays or villages met the World Health Organization (WHO) target for (M-H) intensity STH prevalence of less than 1%, despite the program being implemented for almost a decade. Sentinel surveillance in PSAC, possibly adopting a CDC-based approach, may be implemented biannually in the Philippines and other countries where a similar early child care development system exist to generate data needed to guide policy formulation and program implementation.

The average air dose rate excluding background radiation in this zone decreased to about 20% of the initial value during the period from June 2011 to August 2016, which was essentially a result of the radioactive decay of 134Cs with a half-life of 2.06 y. The air dose rate reduction was faster than that expected from the decay of radiocesium by a factor of about two, with most of this reduction being attributed to the penetration of radiocesium into the soil. The average deposition densities of 134Cs and 137Cs in fields that were not decontaminated were found to have decreased nearly according to their expected radioactive decay, which indicated that the movement of radiocesium in the horizontal direction was relatively small. The effect of decontamination was apparently observed in the measurements of air dose rates and deposition densities. Nominally, the average air dose rates in the measurement locations were reduced by about 20% by decontamination and other human activities, of which accurate quantitative analysis is and continue to be a challenge.

For this study, buffalo bulls were divided into sub-fertile (n = 2) and normal (n = 5) on the basis of sperm mass motility and individual motility. The serum IGF-1 concentration of normal bulls was greater than in sub-fertile bulls, but there was no difference in the seminal IGF-1 concentration among the groups. The values from correlation analyses indicated that serum IGF-1 concentration is positively correlated with semen mass motility and sperm concentration. In the second experiment, IGF-1 did not have antioxidant activities when assessed with DPPH and FRAP assays. In the third experiment, the ejaculates of normal and sub-fertile bulls were cryopreserved using semen extender in which there was IGF-1 supplementation at 0 (control), 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 350 and 450 ng/mL of extender. Supplementation of IGF-1 at 250 ng/ml resulted in improved sperm motility, longevity and membrane intactness as compared to control after cryopreservation of semen from normal buffalo bulls, but not sub-fertile bulls. In summary, serum IGF-1 concentration was correlated with sperm mass motility and concentration in buffalo bulls and supplementation of IGF-1 protected sperm during the cryopreservation process but effects were not due to direct antioxidant activity."

The BVMOs from Parvibaculum lavamentivorans (BVMOParvi) and Oceanicola batsensis (BVMOOcean) are interesting because of their homologies, with >40% sequence identity, and reaction with the same cyclic ketones with a methyl moiety to give different products. The revealed BVMOParvi structure shows that BVMOParvi forms a two-domain structure like other BVMOs. It has two inserted residues, compared with BVMOOcean, that form a bulge near the bound flavin adenine dinucleotide in the active site. Furthermore, this bulge is linked to a nearby α-helix via a disulfide bond, probably restricting access of the bulky methyl group of the substrate to this bulge. Another sequence motif at the entrance of the active site (Ala-Ser in BVMOParvi and Ser-Thr in BVMOOcean) allows a large volume in BVMOParvi. These minute differences may discriminate a substrate orientation in both BVMOs from the initial substrate binding pocket to the final oxygenation site, resulting in the inserted oxygen atom being in different positions of the same substrate.",IFNγ inhibits fibroblast-leading tumor cell invasion through downregulating N-cadherin.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30914199,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2019 04 19,"Tumor metastasis accounts for most tumor-associated mortality and is closely related with stromal fibroblasts in the tumor microenvironment. It was reported that fibroblasts promoted tumor metastasis through directly leading tumor cell invasion; however, inflammatory microenvironment in the growing tumor may influence the outcome. Here, we found that the cytokine IFNγ, a key immune mediator secreted by T cells, could alter mouse lung tumor associated fibroblast-leading LLC tumor cell invasion in Matrigel. The motility of fibroblasts and adhesion with tumor cells were dramatically impaired upon IFNγ stimulation. We further found that IFNγ reduced the expression of N-cadherin on the surface of fibroblasts through upregulating SMAD7 and suppressing the downstream SMAD2 phosphorylation. N-cadherin was essential for fibroblast motility and adhesions with tumor cells. Moreover, fibroblasts could promote tumor progression and the deficiency of IFNγR signaling in fibroblasts reduced liver metastasis of LLC tumor in vivo. Collectively, our results demonstrate that IFNγ inhibits fibroblast-leading tumor cell invasion by inhibiting the motility of fibroblasts and their adhesion with tumor cells. The findings indicate that inflammatory cytokines in the tumor microenvironment may regulate the fibroblast-associated tumor metastasis.",O- glycosylation can regulate the proliferation and migration of human retinal microvascular endothelial cells through ZFR in high glucose condition.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30914198,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2019 04 19,"Angiogenesis is an essential part of the diabetes retinopathy (DR) process, and Zinc Finger RNA Binding Protein (ZFR) is important for vascularization to occur.

And researchers have indicated that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are closely related with glioma progression. Nevertheless, LOC730100 function in glioma is ill studied. In the current research, we showed that LOC730100 expression was increased in glioma tissues and cell lines. Furthermore, LOC730100 upregulation is linked to a poor prognosis in glioma patients. Loss-of-function assays showed that LOC730100 knockdown inhibited proliferation, migration and invasion of glioma cells, but increasing apoptosis. Notably, we found that LOC730100 was mainly localized in the cytoplasm of glioma cells. We demonstrated that LOC730100 was a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) for miR-760 and promoted the expression of FOXA1. We proved that miR-760 suppresses glioma progression and FOXA1 overexpression reversed it. In conclusion, our findings revealed that LOC730100 promoted glioma progression through regulating miR-760/FOXA1 axis.",Activation of Notch1 signaling by HTLV-1 Tax promotes proliferation of adult T-cell leukemia cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30914196,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2019 04 19,"Human T-cell leukemia virus 1 (HTLV-1), an oncogenic retrovirus, and Notch1 signaling, implicated in tumor formation and progression, are both associated with the development of adult T-cell leukemia (ATL). Here we explored the possibility of a mechanistic link between the two. We observed that the expression of Notch intracellular domain (NICD) was elevated in HTLV-1 infected cell lines. Knocking down of Notch1 in ATL cells repressed cellular proliferation and tumor formation both in vitro and in vivo. As a mechanism for these actions, we found that Tax activated Notch1 signaling by prolonging the half-life of NICD. We then showed that Tax, NICD, and RBP-jκ formed a ternary complex, that Tax enhanced the association of NICD with RBP-jκ, and that Tax, NICD, and RBP-jκ were bound to RBP-jκ-responsive elements. Hence, our results suggest that HTLV-1 promotes cellular proliferation and tumor formation of ATL cells by modulating Notch signaling via a posttranslational mechanism that involves interactions between Tax, NICD, and RBP-jκ.",E2f1 regulates the induction of promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger transcription in neuronal differentiation of pluripotent P19 embryonal carcinoma cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30914194,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2019 04 19,"During brain development, the expression of promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (Plzf) in neural stem cells is precisely controlled to maintain the balance between neural stem cell self-renewal and differentiation. However, the mechanism underlying transcriptional regulation of Plzf in neural stem cell is still unclear. Herein, using P19 embryonal carcinoma cells as a model, we observed that Plzf expression was induced in the P19-derived embryonic bodies, which enrich neural stem-like cell populations, as demonstrated by the expression of neural stem cell markers, Nestin and Sox2. We then characterized the Plzf promoter and identified two E2f1 binding sites (-755/-751 and -53/-49, the transcription start site was designated as +1) are important for the activation of Plzf promoter. Finally, we found that the induction of Plzf in the neural stem-like cells derived from pluripotent P19 cells is decrease by E2f1 knockdown. Taken together, we conclude that E2f1 is an important transcription factor that regulates Plzf transcription and may involve in maintaining the self-renewal ability of neural stem cells.",The anticancer effects of 2-methoxyestradiol on human huh7 cells in vitro and in vivo.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30914193,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2019 04 19,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is associated with a poor prognosis. 2-methoxyestradiol (2-ME) is currently under preclinical evaluation as a treatment for many malignancies, but the utility of the drug in terms of HCC treatment remains unclear. Here, we explored the effect of 2-ME on human huh7 cell proliferation and apoptosis and discuss the possible molecular mechanisms involved. The MTT assay showed that proliferation was markedly inhibited by 2-ME (at 5, 10, 15, and 20 μmol/L) in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Moreover, flow cytometry indicated that 2-ME induced cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase, and early apoptosis. We used Western blotting and PCR to detect the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and Bcl-2; 2-ME decreased the mRNA/protein expression levels of both effectors. Furthermore, 2-ME remarkably suppressed xenograft tumor growth in nude mice, and no visible toxicity was observed in either the liver or kidneys. Immunohistochemically, the Bcl-2 and VEGF expression levels were significantly lower than those of controls. Thus, 2-ME inhibited huh7 cell proliferation, promoted apoptosis, and suppressed xenograft tumor growth in nude mice, perhaps reflecting the effects of the drug on VEGF and Bcl-2 expression.",Ellipticine-loaded apoferritin nanocarrier retains DNA adduct-based cytochrome P450-facilitated toxicity in neuroblastoma cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30914192,Toxicology,2019 04 17,"Although ellipticine (Elli) is an efficient anticancer agent, it exerts several adverse effects. One approach to decrease the adverse effects of drugs is their encapsulation inside a suitable nanocarrier, allowing targeted delivery to tumour tissue whereas avoiding healthy cells. We constructed a nanocarrier from apoferritin (Apo) bearing ellipticine, ApoElli, and subsequently characterized. The nanocarrier exhibits a narrow size distribution suggesting its suitability for entrapping the hydrophobic ellipticine molecule. Ellipticine was released from ApoElli into the water environment under pH 6.5, but only less than 20% was released at pH 7.4. The interaction of ApoElli with microsomal membrane particles containing cytochrome P450 (CYP) biotransformation enzymes accelerated the release of ellipticine from this nanocarrier making it possible to be transferred into this membrane system even at pH 7.4 and facilitating CYP-mediated metabolism. Reactive metabolites were formed not only from free ellipticine, but also from ApoElli, and both generated covalent DNA adducts. ApoElli was toxic in UKF-NB-4 neuroblastoma cells, but showed significantly lower cytotoxicity in non-malignant fibroblast HDFn cells. Ellipticine either free or released from ApoElli was concentrated in the nuclei of neuroblastoma cells, concentrations of which being significantly higher in nuclei of UKF-NB-4 than in HDFn cells. In HDFn the higher amounts of ellipticine were sequestrated in lysosomes. The extent of ApoElli entering the nuclei in UKF-NB-4 cells was lower than that of free ellipticine and correlated with the formation of ellipticine-derived DNA adducts. Our study indicates that the ApoElli form of ellipticine seems to be a promising tool for neuroblastoma treatment.",A mathematical model to investigate the effects of intravenous fluid administration and fluid loss.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30914190,Journal of biomechanics,2019 05 03,"The optimal fluid administration protocol for critically ill perioperative patients is hard to estimate due to the lack of tools to directly measure the patient fluid status. This results in the suboptimal clinical outcome of interventions. Previously developed predictive mathematical models focus on describing the fluid exchange over time but they lack clinical applicability, since they do not allow prediction of clinically measurable indices. The aim of this study is to make a first step towards a model predictive clinical decision support system for fluid administration, by extending the current fluid exchange models with a regulated cardiovascular circulation, to allow prediction of these indices. The parameters of the model were tuned to correctly reproduce experimentally measured changes in arterial pressure and heart rate, observed during infusion of normal saline in healthy volunteers. With the resulting tuned model, a different experiment including blood loss and infusion could be reproduced as well. These results show the potential of using this model as a basis for a decision support tool in a clinical setting.",Full-body motion assessment: Concurrent validation of two body tracking depth sensors versus a gold standard system during gait.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30914189,Journal of biomechanics,2019 04 03,"RGB-D cameras provide 3-D body joint data in a low-cost, portable and non-intrusive way, when compared with reference motion capture systems used in laboratory settings. In this contribution, we evaluate the validity of both Microsoft Kinect versions (v1 and v2) for motion analysis against a Qualisys system in a simultaneous protocol. Two different walking directions in relation to the Kinect (towards - WT, and away - WA) were explored. For each gait trial, measures related with all body parts were computed: velocity of all joints, distance between symmetrical joints, and angle at some joints. For each measure, we compared each Kinect version and Qualisys by obtaining the mean true error and mean absolute error, Pearson's correlation coefficient, and optical-to-depth ratio. Although both Kinect v1 and v2 and/or WT and WA data present similar accuracy for some measures, better results were achieved, overall, when using WT data provided by the Kinect v2, especially for velocity measures. Moreover, the velocity and distance presented better results than angle measures. Our results show that both Kinect versions can be an alternative to more expensive systems such as Qualisys, for obtaining distance and velocity measures as well as some angles metrics (namely the knee angles). This conclusion is important towards the off-lab non-intrusive assessment of motor function in different areas, including sports and healthcare."

However, the outcomes of cryopreservation by different user groups often vary due to inconsistency in procedures and freezing equipment. Herein, we report on the feasibility of providing customizable sensing probes with three-dimensional (3-D) printing to monitor cryopreservation phenomena. The objectives were to: 1) introduce 3-D printing as a fabrication method for developing customizable probes to be used in cryogenic applications; 2) design and fabricate an example of a 3-D printed sensing probe and multiplexer capable of detecting phase-change phenomena based on quantitative data regarding sample electrical resistance and temperature, and 3) demonstrate the sensing platform in cryopreservation conditions and in combination with a custom-made 3-D printed freezing device. The sensing probe developed was designed to fit within standard 0.5-ml French straws. Phase-transition phenomena were detected by analyzing electrical resistance changes. The quantitative data from this device in conjugation with a 3-D printed freezer rack provided cryopreservation capability with high reproducibility and offered an alternative to expensive programmable freezers. The use of 3-D printing provided flexibility to develop new sensing probes or modify existing designs based on specific needs.

Over the years, researchers have proposed numerous cytogenetic markers and signatures based on these differences with the aim of biologically discriminating exposure to radiation of varying qualities. Complex chromosome aberrations are a broad classification of aberration types that are known to be characteristically induced after low doses of high-LET.

In some instances, organisms can recover if conditions are alleviated, such as through co-occurrence with other species that confer protection. Biodiverse, multitrophic communities are increasingly recognised as important promoters of species persistence and resilience under environmental change. On intertidal shores, the role of grazers as top-down determinants of algal community structure is well recognised. Similarly, the harvesting of grazers for human consumption is increasingly prevalent with potential to greatly alter the community dynamics. Here, we assess how differences in harvesting pressure of grazers under three management regimes (no-take; managed access; open-access) alters the trophic interactions between grazers, and algal communities. Grazer density and body size frequencies were different among regimes leading to changes in the photosynthetic performance and recovery of crustose coralline algae (CCA) post-bleaching, as well as their presence altering the strength of interactions between species. The exclusion of grazers from patches using cages led to different emergent communities and reduced negative correlations between taxa. The absence of larger grazers (>9 cm) at the managed access site led to macroalgal overgrowth of bleached CCA negatively affecting its recovery, whereas no-take or open-access led to a moderated algal growth and a shift from competitive to facilitative interactions between algal species. Given that CCA play an important role in the population growth and development of other species, the choice of management measure should be carefully considered before implementation, depending on objectives.",Opioid consumption in the Community of Madrid (Spain) between 2004 and 2014.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30914142,Revista clinica espanola,2019 03 27,"Opioid consumption is an appropriate indicator of pain treatment.

Methods Firstly, ADMSCs were isolated from BN and Lewis rats, and the third generation were labeled with CM-DiI. Then 45 male Lewis rats were randomly divided into 3 groups (control group, autologous cell transplantation group, and allogeneic cell transplantation group). The AMI model was established by ligating the rats' left anterior descending artery, and then the infarcted myocardium as well as the peripheral parts was injected by the labeled ADMSCs via the endocardium. At 7 days after ADMSC transplantation, the infiltration of CD4+ T lymphocytes, CD8+ T lymphocytes and CD68+ macrophages were detected by immunofluorescence technique. At 7, 14 and 28 days after transplantation, survival rate of the transplanted cells was compared. Then echocardiography was used to detect the rats' cardiac function at 28 days after transplantation. And the expression of α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) was detected by immunofluorescence technique for determining the angiogenesis near the transplanted cells. Results The positive rate of the cells labeled with CM-DiI was nearly 100%. At 7 days after transplantation, lymphocyte infiltration and macrophages were observed around the transplanted cells in the allogeneic cell transplantation group. No lymphocyte infiltration and macrophages were observed in the autologous cell transplantation group. Compared with allogeneic cell transplantation, the survival rate of the transplanted cells increased significantly. Moreover, the left ventricular short axis shortening rate (LVFS) and the diastolic left ventricular anterior wall thickness (LVAWTd) increased at 7, 14 and 28 days after transplantation. Meanwhile, the number of angiogenesis around the infarcted myocardium also significantly increased. Conclusion Autologous ADMSC transplantation is significantly better at improving cardiac function in AMI rats than allogeneic ADMSC transplantation.",[Knocking down TIMP-1 inhibits the proliferation and collagen synthesis of MRC-5 human embryonic lung fibroblasts induced by TGF-β1].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30914112,Xi bao yu fen zi mian yi xue za zhi = Chinese journal of cellular and molecular immunology,2019 03 27,"Objective To investigate the effects of TIMP-1 gene expression inhibition on the cell growth in human embryonic lung fibroblast MRC-5 induced by tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). Methods MRC-5 cells were divided into blank group, TGF-β1 group, TGF-β1 group transfected with negative control small interfering RNA, and TGF-β1 group transfected with TIMP-1 small interfering RNA (siTIMP-1). The cell viability was measured by MTT assay. The cell cycle of MRC-5 was analyzed by MTT assay and flow cytometry. The content of TNF-α in the supernatant was detected by ELISA, and the protein expression of TIMP-1, α-SMA, collagen 1 and β-catenin were determined by Western blot analysis. Results The expression level of TIMP-1 in the siTIMP-1 group was significantly lower than that in the blank group. Compared with the blank group, the cell viability in the TGF-β1 group was significantly improved; the percentage of the cells in G0/G1 phase was significantly raised, the percentages of the cells in S phase and G2/M phase were significantly increased. The content of TNF-α was significantly elevated, the protein expression of α-SMA, collagen-I and β-catenin were significantly enhanced. Compared with TGF-β1 group, after knock-down of TIMP-1 gene expression, the cell viability in siTIMP-1 combined with TGF-β1 group was significantly inhibited, the percentage of the cells in G0/G1 phase was significantly raised, the percentages of the cells in S phase and G2/M phase were significantly decreased, the content of TNF-α was significantly reduced, and the protein expression of α-SMA, collagen-I and α-catenin was significantly depressed.

Methods Male C57BL/6J mice were treated by high-fat diet for 16 and 38 weeks, and the control group were given normal diet. The body mass and blood glucose levels were measured, and the liver slices were checked by HE staining. Hepatic RNA was extracted and sequenced by a Beijing Genomics Institute (BGI) BGISEQ-500 Sequencing Platform. Original sequence data were aligned and annotated referring to UCSC GRCm38/mm10 mouse genome. Volcano plots were used to profile the mRNA expression data matrix and find out the most significantly regulated hepatic immune-related genes. Real-time PCR was performed to validate the changes of selected genes. Results High-fat diet significantly increased mouse body mass and blood glucose levels, and HE staining showed the accumulation of lipid in the livers of mice treated by high-fat diet. Volcano plots of transcriptome data showed that, high-fat diet significantly changed the expression levels of 157 out of 795 hepatic immune-related genes at week 16.

Methods Primary microglial cells were extracted from neonatal mouse brain cortex. Using CCK-8 assay to detect cell proliferation and immunofluorescence cytochemistry to detect cleaved-caspase 3, the optimal concentration of ACR (0.1 mmol/L) treatment was determined in order to minimize the apoptotic toxicity of ACR (0.01~10 mmol/L, for 48 hours). GBE (100 mg/L) pre-treatment was given 2 hours before ACR treatment. After 48 hours of ACR treatment, immunocytochemistry was used to detect the expression of ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule-1 (IBA-1) and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) for observing the morphological alteration of microglia and NF-κB nuclear translocation, respectively. The concentrations of nitric oxide (NO) and three inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α) in the culture media were examined with Griess reaction and ELISA kits. Real-time PCR was applied to measure mRNA expression levels of IBA-1 and other inflammatory cytokine genes. Recruitments of p65, Nurr1 and CoREST onto the promoter regions of those inflammatory cytokine genes were examined by chromatin immunoprecipitation. Protein interaction between Nurr1 and CoREST was determined by protein immunoprecipitation. Results Long-term low-dose treatment of ACR transformed resting microglia towards activated morpholgy, activated the expression of inflammatory cytokine genes through NF-κB pathway, and resulted in extracellular release of those cytokines. Pre-treatment of GBE greatly prevented microglial activation and its adverse consequences. GBE decreased the recruitment of p65 on the promoter regions of inflammatory cytokine genes, while increased the recruitment of Nurr1-CoREST complex. Conclusion GBE can alleviate microglial inflammatory response induced by long-term low-dose ACR exposure by transrepression of inflammatory cytokine genes, which involves the expelling of p65 and the recruitment of Nurr1-CoREST complex onto NF-κB binding site in their promoters.",[Oxymatrine alleviates the inflammatory damage and its mechanism in rats with TNBS-induced colitis].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30914108,Xi bao yu fen zi mian yi xue za zhi = Chinese journal of cellular and molecular immunology,2019 03 27,"Objective To investigate the effect of oxymatrine on CD11c+ CD103+ E-cadherin+ cells in rats with colitis induced by a mixture of 2, 4, 6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid(TNBS)and ethanol.

Biochemical tests, PON-1 and oxidative stress parameters (malonyl dialdehyde, MDA; superoxide dismutase, SOD; total antioxidant capacity, TAC) were evaluated in the sera of patients with acute pancreatitis at admission (day 0), day 3 and day 10 of follow-up, between June and September 2017. SPSS 13.0 statistical software package programme was used for statistical analyses.Mean age was 51.4 of the total 25 patients. Ranson scores were 0-1 points (60%), 3-4 points (24%) and 5-6 points (16%). CTSI (computed tomography severity index) scores were calculated, and most of the patients were seen to have mild or average pancreatitis (96%). While total cholesterol, triacylglycerol and LDL-C (low-density lipoprotein) levels stayed in their normal limits, there was a significant decrement tendency. HDL-C level was seen to rise significantly above its upper limit at day 10 (p < 0.001). Mean PON-1 levels were measured as 69.23, 76.72 vs. 113.15 U/mL at days 0, 3 and 10, respectively; and it was positively correlated with HDL-C (p < 0.001).

The eighth edition of the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual has changed the criteria so that only grossly evident (macroscopic) ETE involving strap muscles (not microscopic ETE involving perithyroidal soft tissue) affects tumor staging. 
Summary:
 Concordance of identifying microscopic ETE (as well as extranodal extension by carcinoma metastatic to lymph nodes) was previously evaluated among 11 expert endocrine pathologists. The overall agreement rate was slight when rendering a diagnosis of ETE. Concordance was highest when pathologists assessed the spatial relationship of carcinoma to skeletal muscle. This article discusses the significance of these findings. It also reviews relevant anatomic and developmental considerations related to the boundaries of the thyroid. 
Conclusions:
 The results of the concordance study provide additional rationale supporting stringent criteria for diagnosing ETE, as proposed by the eighth edition of the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual. It is expected that these rigid morphologic criteria will potentially reduce interobserver variability and enhance consistency in the diagnosis and staging of thyroid carcinoma."

In cancer, for example, tumour cells can cooperate by producing growth factors. The evolution of cooperation has traditionally been studied for well-mixed populations under the framework of evolutionary game theory, and more recently for structured populations using evolutionary graph theory (EGT). The population structures arising due to cellular arrangement in tissues, however, are dynamic and thus cannot be accurately represented by either of these frameworks. In this work, we compare the conditions for cooperative success in an epithelium modelled using EGT, to those in a mechanical model of an epithelium-the Voronoi tessellation (VT) model. Crucially, in this latter model, cells are able to move, and birth and death are not spatially coupled. We calculate fixation probabilities in the VT model through simulation and an approximate analytic technique and show that this leads to stronger promotion of cooperation in comparison with the EGT model.",The contribution of the left inferior frontal gyrus in affective processing of social groups.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30913979,Cognitive neuroscience,2019 04 05,"We investigated the contribution of the pars opercularis of the left inferior frontal gyrus (LIFGop) in representing knowledge about social groups. We asked healthy individuals to categorize words preceded by semantically congruent or incongruent primes while stimulating the LIFGop. Previous studies showing an involvement of the LIFGop both in processing social stimuli and negative valence words led us to predict that its stimulation would affect responses to negative social category words. Compared to the Vertex as control site, the stimulation of the LIFGop increased the speed of categorization of negative social groups, and disrupted the semantic priming effect for negative words overall. Within the framework of recent theories of semantic memory, we argue that the present results provide initial evidence of the representation of social groups being characterized by affective properties, whose processing is supported by the LIFGop.","Testing Hypersensitive Responses: Ethnic Minorities Are Not More Sensitive to Microaggressions, They Just Experience Them More Frequently.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30913978,Personality & social psychology bulletin,2019 03 27,"Racial microaggressions have attracted significant empirical attention and have been associated with profound negative effects. However, some argue against the importance of microaggressions arguing that (some) responses to microaggressions merely reflect ""hypersensitivity"" to trivial events among certain ethnic minority individuals. Three studies tested this hypersensitivity hypothesis. In two cross-sectional studies with dissimilar samples ( N1 = 130, N2 = 264), ethnic minorities reported experiencing more microaggressions than ethnic majorities did, and microaggressions predicted less life satisfaction. However, contrary to the hypersensitivity hypothesis, minority identity did not moderate this relationship. In a randomized, controlled experiment ( N3 = 114), White and ethnic minority participants reported their positive and negative affect before and after recalling either a microaggression or a control event. Recalling microaggressions reduced positive affect and increased negative affect, but this was also not moderated by minority identity.

However, the resources of healthcare systems are often too limited to provide such treatment at sufficient dosage. Hence, there is a need for evidence-based, cost-effective rehabilitation methods. Here, we asked whether virtual reality-based treatment grounded in the principles of use-dependent learning, behavioral relevance, and intensity positively impacts recovery from nonfluent aphasia. Methods- Seventeen patients with chronic nonfluent aphasia underwent intensive therapy in a randomized, controlled, parallel-group trial. Participants were assigned to the control group (N=8) receiving standard treatment or to the experimental group (N=9) receiving augmented embodied therapy with the Rehabilitation Gaming System for aphasia. All Rehabilitation Gaming System for aphasia sessions were supervised by an assistant who monitored the patients but did not offer any elements of standard therapy. Both interventions were matched for intensity and materials. Results- Our results revealed that at the end of the treatment both groups significantly improved on the primary outcome measure (Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination: control group, P=0.04; experimental group, P=0.01), and the secondary outcome measure (lexical access-vocabulary test: control group, P=0.01; experimental group, P=0.007). However, only the Rehabilitation Gaming System for aphasia group improved on the Communicative Aphasia Log ( P=0.01). The follow-up assessment (week 16) demonstrated that while both groups retained vocabulary-related changes (control group, P=0.01; experimental group, P=0.007), only the Rehabilitation Gaming System for aphasia group showed therapy-induced improvements in language ( P=0.01) and communication ( P=0.05). Conclusions- Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of Rehabilitation Gaming System for aphasia for improving language and communication in patients with chronic aphasia suggesting that current challenges faced by the healthcare system in the treatment of stroke might be effectively addressed by augmenting traditional therapy with computer-based methods.

To model product shelf-life values, possible sample-dependent pathways of degradation that may affect drug efficacy or safety need to be evaluated. As changes in drug thermal stability over time can be correlated with an increased risk of HOS perturbations, the effect of long-term storage on the product should be measured as a function of temperature. Here, complementary high-resolution mass spectrometry methods for HOS analysis were used to identify storage-dependent changes of biotherapeutics (bevacizumab (Avastin), trastuzumab (Herceptin), rituximab (Rituxan), and the NIST reference material 8671 (NISTmAb)) under accelerated or manufacturer-recommended storage conditions. Collision-induced unfolding ion mobility-mass spectrometry data showed changes in monoclonal antibody folded stability profiles that were consistent with the appearance of a characteristic unfolded population. Orthogonal hydrogen-deuterium exchange-mass spectrometry data revealed that the observed changes in unfolding occurred in parallel to changes in HOS localized to the periphery of the hinge region. Using intact reverse-phase liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, we identified several mass species indicative of peptide backbone hydrolysis, located between the variable and constant domains of the heavy chain of bevacizumab. Taken together, our data highlighted the capability of these approaches to identify age- or temperature-dependent changes in biotherapeutic HOS.",Probiotics to prevent Staphylococcus aureus disease?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30913972,Gut microbes,2019 03 27,"There are a plethora of probiotic formulae that supposedly benefit human health on the market. However, the scientific underpinnings of the claimed benefits have remained poorly established. Scientific evidence is now increasingly being provided that explains those benefits, for example, by immune-stimulatory effects or inter-bacterial competition between beneficial and pathogenic bacteria. In our recent study (Piewngam et al. Nature 2018), we show that Bacillus colonization of the human intestine is negatively correlated with that of the human pathogen, Staphylococcus aureus. This type of colonization resistance is achieved by secretion of a class of lipopeptides by Bacillus species that inhibits S. aureus quorum-sensing signaling, which we found is crucial for S. aureus intestinal colonization. Here, we discuss what these findings imply for the general role of S. aureus intestinal colonization, the role of quorum-sensing in that process, and potential alternative ways to control S. aureus infection.",Cervical Muscular Endurance Performance in Women With and Without Migraine.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30913971,The Journal of orthopaedic and sports physical therapy,2019 05 01,"Despite previous evidence, the association between migraines and cervical muscular performance is unclear.",Topographical Pressure Pain Sensitivity Maps of the Feet Reveal Bilateral Pain Sensitivity in Patients With Unilateral Plantar Heel Pain.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30913970,The Journal of orthopaedic and sports physical therapy,2019 03 27,Plantar heel pain is one of the most common foot pain conditions treated by healthcare providers.

Although serious injuries are relatively rare, IPV is one of the leading causes of homicide. IPV victims seeking help in health care are known to be at specific risk of re-abuse. Previous studies of IPV victims in emergency room (ER) settings have focused on injury patterns, but little is known about the violence behind bruises and fractures. The aim of this study was to examine how violence severity and known risk factors for lethal re-abuse in IPV victims attending ERs are associated with injury severity, different patient groups, and referral to advocacy services. This was a prospective, observational, multicenter study of 146 self-reporting IPV victims in two Level IV trauma centers in Helsinki from October 2012 to November 2013. In our sample, serious injuries were rare, but patients had typically suffered severe violence, and half had at least one risk factor for lethal re-abuse. Both sexes and all age groups were represented among the patient profiles, and 88% attended ERs outside common working hours. Only 19% were referred to advocacy, and severe violence or risk factors for lethal re-abuse did not affect prevalence of referrals. Our results show that IPV victims in primary care ERs have typically either experienced severe violence or are at serious risk of re-abuse and even death. The resulting injuries do not usually require medical aftercare, and victims typically present outside common working hours. In the absence of a clear follow-up protocol, most IPV victims are left without any advocacy intervention.","Associations Between Women's Economic and Social Empowerment and Intimate Partner Violence: Findings From a Microfinance Plus Program in Rural North West Province, South Africa.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30913954,Journal of interpersonal violence,2019 03 27,"Given the mixed evidence on whether women's economic and social empowerment is beneficial or not for reducing intimate partner violence (IPV), we explored the relationship between women's empowerment and IPV risk. We analyzed data from baseline interviews with married women ( n = 415) from the Intervention with Microfinance and Gender Equity (IMAGE) longitudinal study in rural South Africa. IMAGE combines a poverty-focused microfinance program with a gender-training curriculum. We fitted logistic regression models to explore associations between women's economic situation/empowerment and IPV. For the multivariable logistic regression, we fitted three models that progressively included variables to explore these associations further. Women who reported ""few to many times"" for not earning enough to cover their business costs faced higher odds of past year physical and/or sexual violence (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 6.1, 1.7-22.3, p = .01). Those who received a new loan experienced higher levels of past year emotional (aOR = 2.8, 1.1-7.4, p = .03) and economic abuse (aOR = 6.3, 2.2-18.5, p = .001). Women who reported that partners perceived their household contribution as not important faced higher odds of past year economic abuse (aOR = 2.8, 1.0-7.8, p = .05). Women who reported joint decision-making or partner making sole reproductive decisions reported higher levels of past year physical and/or sexual violence (aOR = 5.7, 0.9-39.4, p = .07) and emotional abuse (aOR = 3.0, 0.9-10.2, p = .08). Economic stress and aspects of women's empowerment, alongside established gender roles within marital relationships is associated with IPV risk in rural South Africa. Although improved economic conditions for women appears to be protective against physical and sexual IPV, associations between certain indicators of women's economic situation, empowerment, and IPV are inconsistent. We need to consider complementary programming and all types of IPV in research, intervention, and policy, as different aspects of empowerment have varying associations with different types of IPV (physical, sexual, emotional, and economic abuse).",Endometriosis-associated ovarian cancer is a single entity with distinct clinicopathological characteristics.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30913953,Cancer biology & therapy,2019 03 27,To compare the clinicopathological features and chemotherapy response of ovarian clear cell carcinoma (CCC) and endometrioid carcinoma (EC) associated with endometriosis or not.,Application of an immunoglobulin Y-alkaline phosphatase bioconjugate as a diagnostic tool for influenza A virus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30913952,Bioengineered,2019 06 10,"The diagnosis of influenza A virus is essential since it can be confused with influenza A like illness and lead to inaccurate drug prescription.

Violence during pregnancy is even riskier, endangering women's lives and the lives of their fetuses. A nationwide survey in Turkey in 2014 revealed that 7% of women who have experienced a pregnancy were exposed to physical violence perpetrated by an intimate partner during pregnancy. In this study, the risk and protective factors for this particular type of violence and how it can be addressed in Turkey are discussed using nationally representative data for the first time. Data are obtained from surveys conducted in 2008 and 2014 on domestic violence against women. The analysis is based on multinomial regression models in which the dependent variable consists of three groups of women: those who have not been exposed to intimate partner violence (IPV), those whose have been exposed to physical IPV but not during pregnancy, and those who have been exposed to physical IPV during pregnancy. In this way, the factors that have a significant effect on this severe form of violence can be identified. Our findings show that earlier age of first intercourse; the nature of first intercourse; men's affairs; men's controlling behaviors over women; men's use of alcohol, drugs, or gambling; and experience with violence in the family are all significant factors for IPV during pregnancy. Women's empowerment and the restructuring of the unequal power relations between women and men should be targeted to eradicate the problem in the long run. It is concluded that, for the time being, it is crucial to ensure that legal procedures for domestic violence function well and that health institutions are key components in identifying pregnant women exposed to violence and in guiding them toward institutional and social support mechanisms.",Evaluation of the Effects of Clobazam on Seizure Control and Quality of Life in Children With Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome: A Pilot Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30913948,Journal of child neurology,2019 03 27,"This is a prospective study of children with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome receiving clobazam as adjunctive therapy.

In 2016, there were 220 million people over the age of 60, and nearly 10 million completely disabled elderly people who cannot complete Activities of Daily Living (ADLs). Therefore, the topic of influencing factors for disability among the elderly in China has attracted close attention from researchers, most of which use the traditional empirical methods, such as Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) and logistic. Objective: The purpose of this paper was to introduce the Bayesian Quantile Regression (BQR) method to the topic of the disabled elderly, which was achieved by using BQR to study the influencing factors of disability among the elderly in China during 2003-2016. Methods: This paper was the first attempt to use the BQR for the influencing factors of disability among the elderly in China. Furthermore, a comparison was made between the regression results of BQR, OLS, Quantile Regression (QR), and Bayesian Linear Regression (BLR). Results: It was found that there was a relatively stable relationship between chronic diseases and disability, although there was a little difference in different quantiles. In addition, the BQR can obtain results similar to the traditional method. For instance, the coefficient of chronic diseases (to total disability) obtained by OLS, QR, and BLR were basically consistent (around 0.778), which was similar to BQR. The BQR not only provided estimates for all the quantiles, but also provided upper and lower values of a certain confidence interval. Conclusions: By applying the BQR to the influencing factors of disability among the elderly in China, we reached the conclusion that BQR methods are adaptable for this research topic because of their characteristics and advantages over the traditional methods, such as less strict constraints, the estimates for all quantiles, and the combination of historical information with prior information. Moreover, the BQR method appropriately obtained the lower and upper values in a confidence interval, which can provide prediction space for the future.",Clinical management of difficult to treat macroprolactinomas.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30913932,Expert review of endocrinology & metabolism,2019 05 10,"Prolactinomas represent the most common pituitary adenomas encountered in the clinic.

The aim of this review is to identify the bottle neck inefficiencies in NCDs attributable spending and propose sustainable health financing solutions. The World Health Organization (WHO) introduced the ""best buy"" concept to scale up the core intervention package against NCDs targeted for LMICs. Population- and individual-based NCD best buy interventions are projected at US$170 billion over 2011-2025. Appropriately designed health financing arrangements can be powerful enablers to scale up the NCD best buys. Rapidly developing emerging nations dominate the landscape of LMICs. Their capability and willingness to invest resources for eradicating NCDs could strengthen WHO outreach efforts in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, much beyond current capacities. There has been a declining trend in international donor aid intended to cope with NCDs over the past decade. There is also a serious misalignment of these resources with the actual needs of recipient countries. Globally, the momentum towards the financing of intersectoral actions is growing, and this presents a cost-effective solution. A budget discrepancy of 10:1 in WHO and multilateral agencies remains in donor aid in favour of communicable diseases compared to NCDs. LMICs are likely to remain a bottleneck of NCDs imposed financing sustainability challenge in the long-run. Catastrophic household health expenditure from out of pocket spending on NCDs could plunge almost 150 million people into poverty worldwide. This epidemiological burden coupled with population ageing presents an exceptionally serious sustainability challenge, even among the richest countries which are members of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).

Tumors inevitably develop resistance to these agents, and development efforts continue to focus on identifying mechanisms of resistance and drugs to target these mechanisms. Areas covered: With several EGFR TKIs approved for use in the first-line or in later-line settings, an understanding of the efficacy and safety of these inhibitors in various populations is warranted. Furthermore, given the frequent emergence of drug resistance in NSCLC, examination of tumor tissue throughout the disease course provides the opportunity to select treatments based on the tumor's mutation profile. Here, we discuss: key efficacy and safety findings for approved and investigational EGFR TKIs; known mechanisms of resistance, particularly the T790M acquired EGFR mutation; and recent advances in EGFR mutational testing that may facilitate less invasive tissue testing and guide treatment selection. Expert commentary: The expanding armamentarium of EGFR TKIs, improvements in the understanding of resistance mechanisms and technological developments in the molecular analysis of tumors may help render EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC a chronic disease in many patients by facilitating optimal sequential therapy.",Mannose functionalized plain and endosomolytic nanocomposite(s)-based approach for the induction of effective antitumor immune response in C57BL/6 mice melanoma model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30913925,Drug development and industrial pharmacy,2019 05 27,"The goal of present study to assess the antigen specific immunopotentiation effect of mannose functionalized endosomolytic and conventional nanocomposite(s) based combination approach using C57BL/6 mice melanoma model.

The present approach based on mannose surface functionalization for targeting to antigen presenting cells and pH-dependent prompt endosomal release and escape can be a promising system for efficient cancer immunotherapy.",Reduced Dose Computed Tomography: The Effects of Voltage Reduction on Density Measurements of Urolithiasis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30913924,Journal of endourology,2019 05 17,"CT is a widely used imaging modality in the diagnosis of urolithiasis but subjects patients to ionizing radiation. Reduced dose protocols have recently gained wide acceptance. Stone density measurements have been used to predict composition and help guide treatment in standard dose CT (sCT) but not in reduced dose CT (RdCT). We aimed to compare density measurements obtained through RdCT vs sCT and to determine if there is a correlation between stone composition. A total of 201 patients undergoing evaluation for renal colic were prospectively recruited, whereby each subject underwent an sCT (120 kVp) followed immediately by an RdCT (80 or 100 kVp). All calculi <5 mm were excluded to prevent volume averaging and distortion to Hounsfield units measurements. The iliac bone cortex was utilized as an internal control. We also collected stone compositional analyses. In total 36 stones were identified. When the same calculi were evaluated with 120 kVp vs 80 kVp, the RdCT revealed a higher HU (n = 18, 1214 ± 520 vs 1007 ± 307, p < 0.005). Statistical difference was not achieved when 120 kVp was compared with 100 kVp scans (p = 0.151). The percentage differences were 10.6 ± 21 and 1.4 ± 15, respectively. Measurements of the iliac crest mirrored the findings of calculi, with density measurements in 80 kVp being statistically higher than those obtained through 120 kVp. A total of 41 stone analyses were reviewed in accordance with variable CT dosages. When stratified by CT kVp and stone composition, RdCTs trended toward wider density ranges than sCT. Density measurements of urolithiasis in RdCT, achieved by voltage reduction, corresponds to a paradoxical increase in HU. Although HU can be used as a predictor for stone composition, there can be a wide deviation in measured density, and this can be further magnified in the setting of dose reduction.",Longer Operative Time Is Independently Associated With Surgical Site Infection and Wound Dehiscence Following Open Reduction and Internal Fixation of the Ankle.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30913923,Foot & ankle specialist,2019 03 27,Little is known regarding the association of operative time with adverse events following foot and ankle surgery.

As HIV prevalence among pregnant women is reflective of the situation in general population, its closer scrutiny provides valuable insights about the evolving epidemic. The present study assesses temporal trends of sero-discordance (where woman is HIV infected and husband is uninfected), among pregnant women living with HIV (pWLHIV) from India. Data of program for prevention of parent to child transmission of HIV was analyzed. Statistical analysis was done using Cochrane-Armitage trend test and logistic regression. Of the 1209 currently married pWLHIV, 302 (25%) were sero-discordant. The proportion increased from 16% in 2007 to 36% in 2016-17 (p = 0.000). The likelihood of sero-discordance was higher for women aged 18-20 (OR: 2.68, CI: 1.30-5.83) and 21-23 (OR: 1.98, CI: 1.01-4.15) years compared to 36-40 years; and for primi-parous women (OR: 1.84, CI: 1.31-2.58) compared to women pregnant for second/third time. The findings are indicative of changing HIV transmission dynamics. Steeper rise in sero-discordance in younger women implies an increasing risk of HIV in unmarried women population.

Today, an HIV diagnosis is no longer associated with certain death, but is rather a manageable chronic disease, with all HIV-positive patients now eligible to receive treatment. In this study, we explore patient experiences at the onset of the ART programme, including facilitators and barriers around decision-making along the HIV care cascade (HIV testing, ART initiation, retention, and adherence). We conducted twenty-four in-depth interviews among adults (≥18 years old) who initiated ART between April 2004 and March 2005 and were alive, on treatment at enrolment (October 2015-March 2016) at a large public-sector clinic in Johannesburg, South Africa. Data were analysed using a thematic analysis approach. Patients cited physical wellbeing, responsibility for raising children, supportive clinic staff and noticeable improvements in health on ART as key facilitators to continued care. In contrast, changing clinic conditions, fear of side-effects and stigma were mentioned as barriers. This study provides a unique lens through which to evaluate factors associated with long-term retention and adherence to ART at a crucial time in ART programming when more people will be initiating life-long treatment. We must continue to focus on supportive and empathetic clinic environments, more convenient ways to access medication for patients, and developing tools or interventions that continue to address the issues of stigma and discrimination and build the support networks for all those on treatment.",Internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapies for late-life depressive symptoms: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30913898,Aging & mental health,2019 03 27,This study aimed to review and synthesize evidence related to the effectiveness of internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) for reducing depressive symptoms in older adults.,Is symptom prevalence and burden associated with HIV treatment status and disease stage among adult HIV outpatients in Kenya?

We conducted a cross-sectional study among adult (aged at least 18 years) patients with HIV, attending HIV outpatient care in Kenya. Data was gathered through self-report using the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale-Short Form (MSAS-SF), file extraction (sociodemographic data, treatment status, CD4 count, clinical stage) and through observation using the Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS). Multivariable ordinal logistic regression assessed the association of symptom burden (MSAS-SF) controlling for demographic and clinical variables.

The novel training was completed in a group-based format or via an online, asynchronous training program. Pediatric residents from 2 residency programs (n = 63) participated and completed pre- and posttraining surveys evaluating attitudes about previous training, knowledge about child anxiety, perceived evaluation skills, and responses to clinical vignettes. Most residents (81%) reported they did not receive enough prior training in the presentation of anxiety disorders in young children. Residents' knowledge and perceived evaluation skills increased posttraining. On the vignette-based assessment, residents demonstrated increased sensitivity with regard to interference, diagnosis, and referral urgency. Despite some challenges with participation, results provide preliminary evidence that brief training programs could be an effective way to improve resident education."

Ultrasound contrast agents (UCAs) are employed to enhance backscatter echo and improve imaging contrast. The most frequently utilized UCAs are echogenic bubbles made with a phospholipid or protein-stabilized hydrophobic gas core. While clinically utilized, applications of UCAs are often limited by rapid signal decay (<5 min) in vivo under typical ultrasound imaging protocols. Here, we report on a formulation of lipid shell-stabilized perfluoropropane (C3F8) microbubbles and nanobubbles with a significantly prolonged in vivo stability. Microbubbles (875 ± 280 nm) of the target size were prepared by utilizing a multiple-step centrifugation cycle, while nanobubbles (299 ± 189 nm) were isolated from the activated vial using a single centrifugation step. To provide in-depth acoustic characterization of the new construct we evaluated the effect of size and concentration on their in vitro and in vivo performance. In vitro and in vivo characterization were carried out for a range of bubble concentrations normalized by total gas volume quantified via headspace gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). In vitro characterization revealed that nanobubbles at different concentrations are more consistently stable over time with the highest and lowest dilutions (50-fold decrease) only differing in US signal after 8 min exposure by 10.34%, while for microbubbles the difference was 86.46%. As expected, due to the difference in hydrodynamic diameter and scattering cross section difference, nanobubbles showed lower overall initial signal intensity. In vivo experiments showed that both microbubbles and nanobubbles with similar initial peak signal intensity are comparably stable over time with 66.8% and 60.6% remaining signal after 30 min, respectively. This study demonstrates that bubble concentration has significant effects on the persistence of both microbubbles and nanobubbles in vitro and in vivo, but the effects are more pronounced in larger bubbles. These effects should be taken into account when selecting the appropriate bubble parameters for future imaging applications.",Disentangling the Role of Chain Conformation on the Mechanics of Polymer Tethered Particle Materials.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30913883,Nano letters,2019 04 17,"The linear elastic properties of isotropic materials of polymer tethered nanoparticles (NPs) are evaluated using noncontact Brillouin light spectroscopy. While the mechanical properties of dense brush materials follow predicted trends with NP composition, a surprising increase in elastic moduli is observed in the case of sparsely grafted particle systems at approximately equal NP filling ratio. Complementary molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the stiffening is caused by the coil-like conformations of the grafted chains, which lead to stronger polymer-polymer interactions compared to densely grafted NPs with short chains. Our results point to novel opportunities to enhance the physical properties of composite materials by the strategic design of the ""molecular architecture"" of constituents to benefit from synergistic effects relating to the organization of the polymer component.",Identification of the Deprotonated Pyrrole Nitrogen of the Bilin-Based Photoreceptor by Raman Spectroscopy with an Advanced Computational Analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30913882,The journal of physical chemistry. B,2019 04 18,"Phytochrome and cyanobacteriochrome utilize a linear methine-bridged tetrapyrrole (bilin) to control numerous biological processes. They show a reversible photoconversion between two spectrally distinct states. This photocycle is initiated by a C═C double-bond photoisomerization of the bilin followed by its thermal relaxations with transient and/or stationary changes in the protonation state of the pyrrole moiety. However, it has never been identified which of the four pyrrole nitrogen atoms is deprotonated. Here, we report a resonance Raman spectroscopic study on cyanobacteriochrome RcaE, which has been proposed to contain a deprotonated bilin for its green-absorbing 15 Z state. The observed Raman spectra were well reproduced by a simulated structure whose bilin B ring is deprotonated, with the aid of molecular dynamics and quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics calculations. The results revealed that the deprotonation of B and C rings has the distinct effect on the overall bilin structure, which will be relevant to the color tuning and photoconversion mechanisms of the phytochrome superfamily. Furthermore, this study documents the ability of vibrational spectroscopy combined with the advanced spectral analysis to visualize a proton of a cofactor molecule embedded in a protein moiety.",Maslinic Acid Inhibits Colon Tumorigenesis by the AMPK-mTOR Signaling Pathway.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30913881,Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,2019 05 06,"Maslinic acid (MA), a natural triterpenoid abundant in olives, has a variety of bioactivities. However, its effects and mechanisms on colorectal cancer (CRC) still need to be explored. This research evaluated the effects of MA on CRC progression from the aspect of the adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. MA inhibited the proliferation and migration of HCT116 and SW480 cells while inducing apoptosis in these cells. Furthermore, it could activate AMPK and negatively regulate the mTOR pathway. Knockdown of AMPK abolished its inhibitory effect on cell proliferation and migration and blocked the MA-induced apoptosis, revealing that AMPK was associated with the anticancer activity of MA. In addition, MA significantly suppressed the tumorigenesis and regulated the AMPK-mTOR pathway in azoxymethane/dextran sulfate sodium mice and xenograft tumor mice. This study demonstrated that the regulation of AMPK-mTOR signaling could potentially contribute to the beneficial effects of MA, including the prevention of CRC.","Mitochondrial Function, Metabolic Regulation, and Human Disease Viewed through the Prism of Sirtuin 4 (SIRT4) Functions.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30913880,Journal of proteome research,2019 05 03,"As cellular metabolic hubs, mitochondria are the main energy producers for the cell. These organelles host essential energy producing biochemical processes, including the TCA cycle, fatty acid oxidation, and oxidative phosphorylation. An accumulating body of literature has demonstrated that a majority of mitochondrial proteins are decorated with diverse posttranslational modifications (PTMs). Given the critical roles of these proteins in cellular metabolic pathways and response to environmental stress or pathogens, understanding the role of PTMs in regulating their functions has become an area of intense investigation. A major family of enzymes that regulate PTMs within the mitochondria are sirtuins (SIRTs). Albeit until recently the least understood sirtuin, SIRT4 has emerged as an enzyme capable of removing diverse PTMs from its substrates, thereby modulating their functions. SIRT4 was shown to have ADP-ribosyltransferase, deacetylase, lipoamidase, and deacylase enzymatic activities. As metabolic dysfunction is linked to human disease, SIRT4 levels and activities have been implicated in modulating susceptibility to hyperinsulinemia and diabetes, liver disease, cancer, neurodegeneration, heart disease, aging, and pathogenic infections. Therefore, SIRT4 has emerged as a possible candidate for targeted therapeutics. Here, we discuss the diverse enzymatic activities and substrates of SIRT4 and its roles in human health and disease.",Asthmatic Augmentation of Airway Vagal Activity Involves Decreased Central Expression and Activity of CD73 in Rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30913879,ACS chemical neuroscience,2019 04 05,"The severity of asthma is closely related to the intensity of airway vagal activity; however, it is unclear how airway vagal activity is centrally augmented in asthma. Here we report that in an asthma model of male Sprague-Dawley rats, the expression and activity of ecto-5'-nucleotidase (CD73) were decreased in airway vagal centers, ATP concentration in cerebral spinal fluid was increased, and the inhibitory and excitatory airway vagal responses to intracisternally injected ATP (5 μmol) and CD73 inhibitor AMPCP (5 μmol), respectively, were attenuated. In airway vagal preganglionic neurons (AVPNs) identified in medullary slices of neonatal Sprague-Dawley rats, AMPCP (100 μmol·L-1) caused excitatory effects, as are shown in patch-clamp by depolarization, increased neuronal discharge, and facilitated spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSCs). In contrast, exogenous ATP (100 μmol·L-1, 1 mmol·L-1) primarily caused inhibitory effects, which are similar to those induced by exogenous adenosine (100 μmol·L-1). Adenosine A1 receptor antagonist CPT (5 μmol·L-1) blocked the inhibition of sEPSCs induced by 100 μmol·L-1 exogenous ATP and that by 100 μmol·L-1 exogenous adenosine, whereas 50 μmol·L-1 CPT converted the inhibition of sEPSCs induced by 1 mmol·L-1 ATP to facilitation that was blocked by addition of P2X receptor antagonist PPADS (20 μmol·L-1). These results demonstrate that in rat, the sEPSCs of AVPNs are facilitated by extracellular ATP via activation of P2X receptors and inhibited by extracellular adenosine via activation of A1 receptors; in experimental asthma, decreased CD73 expression and activity in airway vagal centers contribute to the augmentation of airway vagal activity through imbalanced ATP/ADO modulation of AVPNs.",Role of Disulfide Bonds and Topological Frustration in the Kinetic Partitioning of Lysozyme Folding Pathways.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30913878,The journal of physical chemistry. B,2019 04 18,"Disulfide bonds in proteins can strongly influence the folding pathways by constraining the conformational space. Lysozyme has four disulfide bonds and is widely studied for its antibacterial properties. Experiments on lysozyme infer that the protein folds through a fast and a slow pathway. However, the reasons for the kinetic partitioning in the folding pathways are not completely clear. Using a coarse-grained protein model and simulations, we show that two out of the four disulfide bonds, which are present in the α-domain of lysozyme, are responsible for the slow folding pathway. In this pathway, a kinetically trapped intermediate state, which is close to the native state, is populated. In this state, the orientations of α-helices present in the α-domain are misaligned relative to each other. The protein in this state has to partially unfold by breaking down the interhelical contacts between the misaligned helices to fold to the native state. However, the topological constraints due to the two disulfide bonds present in the α-domain make the protein less flexible, and it is trapped in this conformation for hundreds of milliseconds. On disabling these disulfide bonds, we find that the kinetically trapped intermediate state and the slow folding pathway disappear. Simulations mimicking the folding of protein without disulfide bonds under oxidative conditions show that the native disulfide bonds are formed as the protein folds, indicating that folding guides the formation of disulfide bonds. The sequence of formation of the disulfide bonds is Cys64-Cys80 → Cys76-Cys94 → Cys30-Cys115 → Cys6-Cys127. Any disulfide bond that forms before its precursor in the sequence has to break and follow the sequence for the protein to fold. These results show that lysozyme also serves as a very good model system to probe the role of disulfide bonds and topological frustration in protein folding. The predictions from the simulations can be verified by single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer or single-molecule pulling experiments, which can probe heterogeneity in the folding pathways.",Induced Circular Dichroism of Achiral Cyclic Bisurea via Hydrogen Bonds with Chiral Carboxylates.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30913877,The Journal of organic chemistry,2019 06 10,"Chiral induction properties of achiral bisurea derivatives by binding tetrabutylammonium salts of N-acetylated chiral carboxylates (Ac-AlaO-, Ac-ValO-, Ac-LeuO-, and Ac-PheO-) was studied. Ultraviolet-visible titrations showed 1:1 complex formation between the bisureas and the carboxylates. The calculated association constants of cyclic bisurea (1a) were 5-10 times larger than those of the acyclic derivative (2), and 1a showed the highest binding affinity for Ac-LeuO-. While circular dichroism (CD) of both 1a and 2 was induced upon the addition of chiral carboxylates, the CD intensity of 1a was greater than that of 2. Especially, the intensity induced by chiral Ac-LeuO- was the greatest. 1H nuclear magnetic resonance titrations and density functional theory (DFT) calculations showed the cooperative hydrogen bonds of four urea N-Hs and the carboxylate group and the CH-π interactions between a naphthyl unit of 1a and the methyl moieties of Ac-LeuO-. Furthermore, DFT calculations suggested that the twisted anticlockwise conformation of 1a would be dominantly induced by Ac-d-LeuO-. The CD intensity changes of 1a showed a good linear relationship with the enantiomeric excess (ee) values of Ac-LeuO-; therefore, 1a could be utilized as a stereodynamic chiral probe for determining the ee of chiral anions.",Nature of Monomeric Molybdenum(VI) Cations in Acid Solutions Using Theoretical Calculations and Raman Spectroscopy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30913876,The journal of physical chemistry.

The PL intensities of the mp-Eu₂O₃/SnO₂(nMgO) films were largely dependent on the mixing amount of MgO, n, and they showed the largest PL intensities at n ═ 10-20. The existence of well-developed macropores in the films largely improved the response properties to some target gases. Namely, the responses of the mp-Eu₂O₃/SnO₂(nMgO) sensors to 5-50% O₂ in N₂ and 8000 ppm H₂ in air was much larger than that of conventional Eu₂O₃/SnO₂(nMgO) sensors without such macropores, which were fabricated by screen printing. The mp-Eu₂O₃/SnO₂(nMgO) sensors also obviously showed large responses to 2% H₂O and 3-60 ppm NO₂ in air. In addition, their PL intensities increased after the addition of O₂ into N₂, H₂O in air, and NO₂ in air, while they decreased after the addition of H2 in air.

Both techniques XRD and Raman spectroscopy confirm the presence of cubic phase of CeO₂ with fluorite structure and they also show a peak shift after the introduction of Cu which is an indication of the total symmetry breaking of ceria structure. This may be related with the partial substitution of Ce4+ by Cu2+ cations in the CeO₂ lattice. TEM analysis results provide an average size of 27.4 nm for Cu-doped CeO₂ particles. XPS confirms the Cu2+ species in Cu-doped sample. The prepared Cu-Ce materials are explored for phenol degradation.

Ti foil anodization was carried out in non-aqueous solutions and in aqueous solutions at pH 7 and pH 12.6.

Cluster formation was also observed for 0.16 wt% Ru loading. The X-ray diffraction spectra showed anatase and rutile phase in pure Ti/TiO₂ and Ru/Ti/TiO₂ nanotubes. Therefore, ruthenium doping did not modify the crystalline phase of Ti/TiO₂. Raman spectra did not reveal the rutile phase of TiO₂ in the composites which is attributed to the laser characteristics used.

Especially, 40 mg/L of methyl orange could be completely degraded in 40 min, and the TOC removal rate was as high as 73.3%. The high catalytic performance arises from the following reasons: (i) The support of TPAFe rendered a significant increase in specific surface area and a slight increase in interlayer spacing of montmorillonite, thus improving the adsorption performance. (ii) The incorporation of tungstophosphoric acid (TPA) not only effectively anchor iron but also improved visible light absorption capacity, which greatly promoted the Fenton reaction. Moreover, the catalyst showed excellent chemical stability. After ten consecutive degradation cycles, the degradation efficiency still reached about 99% due to the good fixation iron of TPA.

To this aim, we first synthesized soft Mn-Zn ferrite magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) through an easy-scalable, eco-friendly strategy based on aqueous co-precipitation in basic media, starting from transition metal chlorides. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) analyses evidenced the formation of crystalline nanoparticles with the cubic spinel structure and average crystal size of 7.5 nm. Standard magnetometric measurements showed a saturation magnetization value of ca. 56 emu/g and no magnetic irreversibility at room temperature. The MNPs were then compacted applying an uniaxial pressure over a toroidal shaped die. In order to obtain a material with a density close to the bulk one, the as-prepared green toroids underwent either a classic sintering treatment, obtaining a microstructured system, or to High Pressure Field Assisted Sintering Technique (HP-FAST), which allowed for preserving the nanostructure. The relative permeability and core losses of the toroidal samples were evaluated in the frequency range 1-2 MHz using an in-house built setup. The comparison of the behavior of samples obtained by the two different sintering approaches showed the nanostructured samples had a much smaller relative magnetic permeability (ten times lower than the microstructured sample) and, consequently, higher core losses. However, when samples with similar μr were compared, a significant decrease of core losses at the larger frequencies was observed. This result suggests HP-FAST is a very promising approach to prepare high density nanostructured soft magnetic materials.",Increasing the Magnetic Anisotropy of a Natural System: Co-Doped Magnetite Mineralized in Ferritin Shells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30913808,Journal of nanoscience and nanotechnology,2019 03 27,"Iron oxide nanoparticles mineralized within the internal cavity of Ferritin protein cage are extremely appealing for the realization of multifunctional therapeutic and diagnostic agents for cancer treatment by drug delivery, magnetic fluid hyperthermia (MFH) and magnetic resonance imaging. Being the maximum mean size imposed by the internal diameter of the protein shell (ca. 8 nm) too small for the use of these systems in MFH, a valuable strategy for the improvement of the hyperthermic efficiency is increasing the magnetic anisotropy by doping the iron oxide with divalent Co ions. This strategy has been demonstrated to be highly efficient in the case of iron oxide nanoparticles mineralized in Human Ferritin (HFt). However, a deterioration of nanoparticles crystallinity and consequently a reduction of the hyperthermic efficiency were observed with increasing Co-doping. In this contribution, we compare two series of Co-doped iron oxide nanoparticles (Co-doping level up to 15%) mineralized into HFt and into Ferritin from the archaea Pirococcus Furiosus (PfFt), the protein structure of which differs for the nucleation sites, with the aim of increasing the crystalline quality of the inorganic cores for larger Co doping. Highly monodisperse nanoparticles of 6-7 nm were obtained in both series. The structural and magnetic characterization indicate that the PfFt series is less subjected to crystallinity deterioration with increasing Co content with respect to the HFt one. Such difference is reflected in the hyperthermic efficiency, which reaches the maximum value for different intermediate Co-doping (10% and 5% for PfFt and HFt, respectively), and goes to zero for further Co-doping increments."

The results of XRD and TEM confirmed that EP nanocomposites with low incorporation of CuAl-(APG)LDH were exfoliated structures. The TGA results showed that the incorporation of CuAl-(APG)LDH remarkably increased the residues at 700 °C. The improved flame retardancy of EP/CuAl-(APG)LDH nanocomposites was proved by cone calorimeter test. The peak heat release rate, total heat release, peak smoke production rate and total smoke production value of EP/4 wt%CuAl-(APG)LDH nanocomposites dramatically decreased, which were attributed to the formation of hard and condensed residual layers on the surface of EP/CuAl-(APG)LDH nanocomposites.",Crystallite Size Increase of Silver Nanoparticles by Ligand Exchange and Subsequent Washing Process with Antisolvent.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30913749,Journal of nanoscience and nanotechnology,2019 03 27,"Desorption performance of ligands from silver nanoparticles extremely affects a sintering process of nanoinks for their writing fine pattern. In this study, we investigated desorption behaviors of ligands on the surface of silver nanoparticle through ligand exchange and subsequent washing process with antisolvent. Ligand exchange reactions from oleic acid to tri-n-octylphosphine oxide (TOPO), octanoic acid (OA), and 1-dodecanethiol (DDT) were carried out on the surface of silver nanoparticle. After the washing process with methanol as an antisolvent, their crystallite sizes and the amounts of ligands existing on the particle surface were evaluated by powder X-ray diffraction and thermogravimetric analysis, respectively. In the case of ligand exchange with TOPO, the crystallite size dramatically increased and the amount of ligands existing on the particle surface significantly decreased. This result shows that TOPO is easy to desorb from the silver surface in the washing process with methanol, which resulted in the efficient coalescence of silver. In contrast, the coalescence of silver nanoparticles capped with OA and DDT was less efficient. Moreover, the effect of the antisolvent in the washing process on the coalescence of silver was demonstrated in detail.",One-Step Hydrothermal Synthesis of SnO₂@Carbon Composites with Super Lithium Ions Storage Performances.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30913748,Journal of nanoscience and nanotechnology,2019 03 27,"Tin oxide (SnO₂) based anode materials for lithium ion batteries (LIBs) have drawn much attention for their high theoretical capacity and energy density, but suffer from a large volume change and resulting a rapid capacity fading during charging/discharging cycles. To optimize the status, herein, SnO₂/carbon composites are synthesized using SnCl₄ · 5H₂O and glucose with different mass ratio as raw materials via a simple one-step hydrothermal process, following calcination under Ar gas atmosphere. As comparison, pure SnO₂ is synthesized as the same as SnO₂/carbon composites without glucose and calcination in air. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were used to investigate the lithium ions storage behavior in pure SnO₂ and the SnO₂@carbon composites. The EIS results indicate that pure SnO₂ has much larger electronic transfer resistance and smaller diffusion coefficient of Li+ resulting worst electrochemical performances, while carbon can substantially enhance the electronic conductivity of the composites and resulting better cycle stability and rate capability of the composite anodes. Moreover, the stability and capacity of the composites are different from each other due to diverse carbon content, surface area and particle size, in which, SnO₂-24%C exhibits better lithium storage performances. The initial discharge/charge capacities are up to 1650 and 890 mAh g-1 at the current density of 0.2 A g-1, and the reversible capacity even still maintains at 800 mAh g-1 after 60 cycles. The super electrochemical performances are attributed to that the proper content of carbon clusters as a support can buffer volume expansion of SnO₂ during cycling, enhance the electrode conductivity and accelerate the diffusion of Li+ ions in the composite. The results implying that the composite with proper carbon content has a wide application prospect for anode material of LIBs.",Solvent Tailored Strategy for Synthesis of Ultrasmall Ag₂S Quantum Dots with Near-Infrared-II Luminescence.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30913747,Journal of nanoscience and nanotechnology,2019 03 27,"Highly luminescent semiconductor with ultrasmall size is always desirable for biomedical applications.

The adsorption performance of the adsorbent for the removal of methylene blue (MB) was evaluated through investigating the experimental parameters such as initial dye concentration, temperature, adsorbent dose, contact time, and solution pH. The Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm models were applied to fit the equilibrium data. The maximum adsorption capacity of methylene blue onto the CAGO-4 composite was 374.53 mg/g at 323 K. The kinetic data showed a good determination with pseudo-second-order equation. Thermodynamic analysis indicated that the adsorption was an endothermic and spontaneous process.","Comparison of the Physical and Electrical Properties of HfO₂/Al₂O₃/HfO₂/GeO

A few layers of two-dimensional MoS₂ nanosheets were synthesized over graphene oxide nanosheets via a simple one-pot green synthesis process. Pd QDs were then placed over MoS₂/RGO by a simple green process at room temperature. High resolution transmission electron microscopic (HR-TEM) images revealed that Pd QDs were uniformly distributed over MoS₂/RGO nanosheets and dark regions, confirming the existence of MoS₂ sheets over graphene sheets. The activity of low quantity Pd QDs (5 weight%) grafted MoS₂/RGO hybrid catalyst for electrocatalysis of alcohol and water oxidation reaction was tested. Improved catalytic activity and high peak current response of 11.2 mA cm-2 and 2 mA cm-2 were obtained towards methanol and ethylene glycol oxidation, respectively. Additionally, the oxidation of poisonous intermediates and water were tested with this electrode and enhanced catalytic activity was observed. These characteristic improvements of Pd QDs-MoS₂/RGO nanohybrid are due to the smaller size of Pd particles and effective interaction between MoS₂ and RGO.

The injected precursors were vaporized in the plasma flame followed by vapor-phase reaction and subsequent quenching of the vaporized precursors produced nanosized AZO. XRD results indicate the presence of wurtzite structure without any alumina peaks and SEM micrographs revealed spherical particles. The nanosized AZO would make an excellent material for use as photocatalyst due to high surface to volume ratio. The photocatalytic properties of AZO nanopowder were investigated using the degradation of methylene blue under ultra-violet irradiation. The effects of various parameters, such as catalyst amount, the presence of oxidant, temperature, bubbling of O2 gas, pH, specific surface area, oxygen vacancies, and initial concentration, were studied. The optical study showed that doping leads to a red-shift in band gap. Furthermore, the AZO nanoparticles exhibited superior photocatalytic activity compared with ZnO. The improvement was ascribed to an increase in specific surface area and oxygen vacancies. Kinetic analyses indicated that the photodegradation of methylene blue followed a pseudo-first order kinetic model based on the Langmuir-Hinshelwood (L-H) mechanism.","Role of Annealing Temperatures on Mechanical, Optical, Electrical and Magnetic Properties of Nanohydroxyapatite Biomaterial.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30913727,Journal of nanoscience and nanotechnology,2019 03 27,"Nanosized hydroxyapatite [Ca10(Po₄)6(OH)₂ or HAp] was prepared by applying wet-chemical precipitation technique.

Genomic imprinting can arise from parental conflicts over resource allocation to the offspring, which could drive imprinted loci to evolve by positive selection. We investigate whether positive selection is associated with genomic imprinting in the inbreeding species Arabidopsis thaliana. Our analysis of 140 genes regulated by genomic imprinting in the A. thaliana seed endosperm demonstrates they are evolving more rapidly than expected. To investigate whether positive selection drives this evolutionary acceleration, we identified orthologs of each imprinted gene across 34 plant species and elucidated their evolutionary trajectories. Increased positive selection was sought by comparing its incidence among imprinted genes with nonimprinted controls. Strikingly, we find a statistically significant enrichment of imprinted paternally expressed genes (iPEGs) evolving under positive selection, 50.6% of the total, but no such enrichment for positive selection among imprinted maternally expressed genes (iMEGs). This suggests that maternally- and paternally expressed imprinted genes are subject to different selective pressures. Almost all positively selected amino acids were fixed across 80 sequenced A. thaliana accessions, suggestive of selective sweeps in the A. thaliana lineage. The imprinted genes under positive selection are involved in processes important for seed development including auxin biosynthesis and epigenetic regulation. Our findings support a genomic imprinting model for plants where positive selection can affect paternally expressed genes due to continued conflict with maternal sporophyte tissues, even when parental conflict is reduced in predominantly inbreeding species.",Association Between Extra-Genital Congenital Anomalies and Hypospadias Outcome.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30913557,"Sexual development : genetics, molecular biology, evolution, endocrinology, embryology, and pathology of sex determination and differentiation",2019 06 09,"Extra-genital congenital anomalies are often present in cases of hypospadias, but it is unclear whether they have an association with the outcome of hypospadias surgery.

An extra-genital congenital anomaly was reported in 139 (22%) boys and 62 (10%) had more than 1 anomaly. Of the 626 boys, 54 (9%), including 44 with proximal hypospadias, had endocrine as well as limited genetic evaluation.

At least 1 complication was reported in 167 (27%) patients, with 20% of complications (most frequently fistula) occurring after 2 years of surgery. The severity of hypospadias and the existence of other anomalies were clinical factors that were independently associated with an increased risk of complications (p < 0.001). In conclusion, complications following surgery are more likely in those cases that are proximal or who have additional extra-genital anomalies. To understand the biological basis of these complications, there is a greater need to understand the aetiology of such cases.","Spatiotemporal Correlations between amh and cyp19a1a Transcript Expression and Apoptosis during Gonadal Sex Differentiation of Pejerrey, Odontesthes bonariensis.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30913555,"Sexual development : genetics, molecular biology, evolution, endocrinology, embryology, and pathology of sex determination and differentiation",2019 06 09,"Sex determination in pejerrey is genetically prescribed by the Y chromosome-linked anti-müllerian hormone amhy but is also strongly influenced by water temperature during the critical period of sex determination. Its gonadal differentiation is characterized by a cephalocaudal and left-to-right histological gradient in both sexes that presumably helps prevent discrepant intersex development in different regions of the gonads in response to ambiguous thermal and genetic stimuli, but the relation of this gradient to molecular processes of sex differentiation is unknown. In this study, we investigated the spatiotemporal expression patterns of amh, gonadal aromatase (cyp19a1a), and apoptosis in relation to the histological gradient in ovaries and testes at an intermediate, sexually neutral temperature. The location and timing of expression of amh, cyp19a1a, and apoptosis seemed to be highly coordinated with the time of gonadal sex differentiation and the histological gradient of gonadal sex differentiation. Apoptosis occurred predominantly in the anterior region of the right gonads and is surmised to be a process to delay differentiation in this area compared to the left gonad, possibly as a means to ensure uniform development in both gonads. Aromatase expression early during development was noted even in putative XY males, supporting the notion of primacy of female development in pejerrey gonads. Thus, apoptosis may be particularly important to prevent discrepant gonadal differentiation in XY individuals where genetic pro-male (amhy), pro-female (cyp19a1a), and thermal stimuli may antagonize.",Digital image analysis for measuring nanogap distance produced by adhesion lithography.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30913554,Nanotechnology,2019 04 29,"A simple digital image analysis for measuring nanogap distance produced by adhesion lithography is proposed. Adhesion lithography produces metal electrodes with sub-15 nm undulated space and μm to mm scale width without using electron beam lithography. Although the process has been rapidly improved in recent years, there has been no generalized procedure to evaluate the nanogap distance. In this study, we propose a procedure to evaluate a nanogap electrode with large width/gap distance ratios (>1000). The procedure is to determine the average distance of nanogap space from the area and the perimeter of the space by the analysis of the grayscale image. This procedure excludes any arbitrariness of the estimation and gives quantitative comparison of nanogap electrodes produced by different processes.",On the competition between the Kondo effect and the exchange interaction in a parallel double quantum dot system.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30913553,Journal of physics.

The strong on-site Coulomb interactions in DQDs are treated by using the Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation and the introduction of scalar potential fields. We show that a self-consistent perturbation approach, which takes into account the statistical properties of the potential fields acting on electrons in DQDs, describes well the crossover from the Kondo regime to the spin-singlet state in this system. The linear conductance and the intradot/interdot spin excitation spectra of this system are obtained."

This study proposed and evaluated different deformable image registration (DIR) methods for this application. Twenty patients who underwent EBRT and BT for LACC were retrospectively analyzed. Each patient had a pre-BT CT at EBRT boost (without applicator) and a CT and MRI at BT (with applicator). The evaluated DIR methods were the diffeomorphic Demons, commercial intensity and hybrid methods, and three different biomechanical models. The biomechanical models considered different boundary conditions (BCs). The impact of the BT devices insertion on the anatomy was quantified. DIR method performances were quantified using geometric criteria between the original and deformed contours. The BT dose was deformed toward the pre-CT BT by each DIR method. The impact of boundary conditions to drive the biomechanical model was evaluated based on the deformation vector field and dose differences. The GEC-ESTRO guideline dose indices were reported. Large organ displacements, deformations, and volume variations were observed between the pre-BT and BT anatomies. Rigid registration and intensity-based DIR resulted in poor geometric accuracy with mean Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) inferior to 0.57, 0.63, 0.42, 0.32, and 0.43 for the rectum, bladder, vagina, cervix and uterus, respectively. Biomechanical models provided a mean DSC of 0.96 for all the organs. By considering the cervix-uterus as one single structure, biomechanical models provided a mean DSC of 0.88 and 0.94 for the cervix and uterus, respectively. The deformed doses were represented for each DIR method. Caution should be used when performing DIR for this application as standard techniques may have unacceptable results. The biomechanical model with the cervix-uterus as one structure provided the most realistic deformations to propagate the BT dose toward the EBRT boost anatomy.",Tubastatin A inhibits HDAC and Sirtuin activity rather than being a HDAC6-specific inhibitor in mouse oocytes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30913540,Aging,2019 04 21,"Tubastatin A (TubA) is a highly selective histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) inhibitor. As expected, mouse germinal vesicle oocytes fail to extrude the first polar body following TubA treatment. However, a previous study demonstrated that homozygous Hdac6 knockout (KO) mice can be viable and fertile. Therefore, we asked whether TubA is indeed a specific inhibitor of HDAC6 activity. RNA-sequencing and in silico analysis demonstrated that the TubA-treated group presented significant changes in the expression of Hdac subfamily genes such as Hdac6, 10, and 11, and Sirtuin 2, 5, 6, and 7. Additionally, gene expression related to the p53, MAPK, Wnt, and Notch signaling pathways in the TubA-treated group were increased significantly; in contrast, gene expression related to metabolism, DNA replication, and oxidative phosphorylation was decreased significantly. Furthermore, gene expression related to cell cycle, cell structure, pyrimidine metabolism, pentose phosphate pathway, mitochondrial activation, proteasome pathway, RNA polymerase, DNA replication, cyclin-dependent kinase, nucleolar activity, and MI arrest were significantly decreased, indicating that TubA-induced abnormal meiotic maturation and oocyte senescence may be due to the combined effects of HDAC and Sirtuin inhibition, and not HDAC6 inhibition alone. Thus, we believed that this system could provide a model for monitoring the effects of TubA on mouse oocytes.",The avian chorioallantoic membrane as an alternative tool to study medullary thyroid cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30913539,Endocrine connections,2019 04 28,"Preclinical trials of medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) therapeutics require both in vitro and in vivo analyses. Human tumour xenografted rodent models, which are considered the 'gold standard' to study and validate the efficacy and toxicity of lead compounds before translation to clinical trials, are very expensive, subject to organismal variability and ethical controversies. The avian chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay provides an alternative versatile, cost effective and ethically less objectionable short-term, in vivo model for reliable screening of drugs. In this work, we grafted two MTC cell lines and patient derived MTC tumour samples onto the avian CAM and characterised the resulted tumours histologically and immunohistochemically. Our findings provide the evidence that the CAM assay is a suitable model for studying the pathophysiology of MTC and can even be used as in vivo system for drug testing.",Irisin in the primate hypothalamus and its effect on GnRH in vitro.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30913538,The Journal of endocrinology,2019 03 26,"Irisin, encoded by the FNDC5 gene, is a recently discovered endocrine factor mainly secreted as a myokine and adipokine. However, irisin/FNDC5 expression has also been reported in different other organs including components of the reproductive axis. Yet, there is the scarcity of data on FNDC5/irisin expression, regulation, and its reproductive effects, particularly in primates. Here, we report the expression of FNDC5/irisin, along with PGC1A (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha) and ERRA (estrogen-related receptor alpha), in components of the reproductive axis of marmoset monkeys. Hypothalamic FNDC5 and ERRA transcript levels are developmentally regulated in both male and female. We further uncovered sex-specific differences in FNDC5, ERRA, and PGC1A expression in muscle and the reproductive axis. Moreover, irisin and ERRα co-localize in the marmoset hypothalamus. Additionally, in the arcuate nucleus (ARC) of rhesus monkeys, the number of irisin+ cells was significantly increased in short-term fasted monkeys as compared to ad libitum fed monkeys. More importantly, we observed putative interaction of irisin immunoreactive fibers and few GnRH immunoreactive cell bodies in the ARC of the rhesus monkeys. Functionally, we noted a stimulatory effect of irisin on GnRH synthesis and release in mouse hypothalamic neuronal GT1-7 cells. In summary, our findings show that FNDC5 and irisin are developmentally, metabolic-status dependently, and sex-specifically expressed in the primate HPG axis and exert a stimulatory effect on GnRH expression and release in mouse hypothalamic cells. Further studies are required to confirm the reproductive effects of irisin in vivo and to illuminate the mechanisms of its regulation.",Bag-1L: a promising therapeutic target for androgen receptor-dependent prostate cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30913537,Journal of molecular endocrinology,2019 03 26,"Androgens are important determinants of normal and malignant prostate growth. They function by binding to the C-terminal ligand-binding domain (LBD) of the androgen receptor (AR). All clinically approved AR targeting antiandrogens for prostate cancer therapy function by competing with endogenous androgens. Despite initial robust responses to androgen deprivation therapy, nearly all patients with advanced prostate cancer relapse with lethal castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Progression to CRPC is associated with ongoing androgen receptor (AR) signaling, which in part, is due to the expression of constitutively active AR splice variants that contain the N-terminus of the receptor but lack the C-terminus. Currently, there are no approved therapies specifically targeting the AR N-terminus. Current pharmacologic targeting strategies for inhibiting the AR N-terminal region have proven difficult, due to its intrinsically unstructured nature and lack of enzymatic activity. An alternative approach is to target key molecules such as the co-chaperone Bag-1L that bind to and enhance the activity of the AR AF-1. Here, we review recent literature that suggest Bag-1L is a promising target for AR positive prostate cancer.",MECHANISMS OF ENDOCRINE DISEASE: Sarcopenia in endocrine and non-endocrine disorders.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30913536,European journal of endocrinology,2019 05 07,"Objective This paper reviews the main mechanisms, diagnostic criteria, treatment options and available data on sarcopenia in endocrine and non-endocrine disorders. The literature notes the presence of sarcopenia as a comorbid condition or a complication of another clinical situation and not a disease that only affects elderly patients. Method We performed a literature review, focusing on the following: mechanisms related to sarcopenia in elderly patients, and sarcopenia as it presents in the context of chronic and endocrine diseases; diagnostic tools and methods; aspects of sarcopenia and treatment options specific to chronic diseases and endocrine disorders respectively. Results Sarcopenia in chronic and endocrine disorders shares many mechanisms with sarcopenia affecting elderly patients, but certain diseases can have a predominant aspect that leads to sarcopenia. The prevalence of sarcopenia varies, depending on different diagnostic criteria, from around 12 to 60% in chronic illnesses and 15 to 90% in endocrine disorders. The interplay between sarcopenia, chronic diseases and elderly patients requires further study, to clarify the impact of each, in terms of prognosis and mortality. Conclusion Awareness of the presentation of sarcopenia in the context of other diseases and ages (and not just the elderly) is fundamental to ensure that preventive measures can be deployed.",Palmitic acid causes insulin resistance in granulosa cells via activation of JNK.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30913535,Journal of molecular endocrinology,2019 03 26,"Obesity is a worldwide health problem with rising incidence and results in reproductive difficulties. Elevated saturated free fatty acids (FFAs) in obesity can cause insulin resistance (IR) in peripheral tissues. The high intra-follicular saturated FFAs may also account for IR in ovarian granulosa cells (GCs). In the present study, we investigated the relationship between saturated FFAs and IR in GCs by the use of palmitic acid (PA). We demonstrated that the glucose uptake in cultured GCs and lactate accumulation in the culture medium were stimulated by insulin, but the effects of insulin were attenuated by PA treatment. Besides, insulin-induced phosphorylation of Akt was reduced by PA in a dose and time-dependent manner. Furthermore, PA increased phosphorylation of JNK and JNK blockage rescued the phosphorylation of Akt which was down-regulated by PA. These findings highlighted the negative effect of PA on GCs metabolism and may partially account for the obesity-related reproductive disorders.",Errors and Insight: Intentional and accidental studies of human chromosome abnormalities.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30913534,"Reproduction (Cambridge, England)",2019 03 26,"Perhaps every career makes sense in retrospect.

It is considered a 'pre-malignant' lesion of the RAS-like group. Ultrasonography (US), cytology and molecular tests are useful to suspect thyroid nodules that correspond to NIFTP but there is wide overlap of the results with the encapsulated follicular variant of PTC (E-FVPTC). In these nodules that possibly or likely correspond to NIFTP, if surgery is indicated, lobectomy is favored over total thyroidectomy. The diagnosis of NIFTP is made after complete resection of the lesion by observing well-defined criteria. In the case of patients who received the diagnosis of FVPTC and whose pathology report does not show findings of malignancy (lymph node metastasis, extrathyroidal invasion, vascular/capsular invasion), if the tumor was encapsulated or well delimited, the slides can be revised by an experienced pathologist to determine whether the diagnostic criteria of NIFTP are met, but special attention must be paid to the adequate representativeness of the capsule and tumor. Since NIFTP is not 'malignant', tumor staging is not necessary and patients are not submitted to thyroid cancer protocols or guidelines. We believe that patients with NIFTP without associated malignancy and without nodules detected by US of the remnant lobe (if submitted to lobectomy) can be managed like those with follicular adenoma.",The Fusarium graminearum cerato-platanins loosen cellulose substrates enhancing fungal cellulase activity as expansin-like proteins.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30913532,Plant physiology and biochemistry : PPB,2019 05 17,"Cerato-platanin proteins (CPPs) are small non-catalytic, cysteine-rich hydrophobic proteins produced by filamentous fungi. The genome of Fusarium graminearum, the causal agent of Fusarium head blight disease of wheat and other cereal grains, contains two genes putatively encoding for CPPs. To better characterize their features, the two FgCPPs were heterologously expressed in Pichia pastoris. The recombinant FgCPPs reduced the viscosity of a cellulose soluble derivate (carboxymethyl cellulose, CMC). The same effect was not observed on other polysaccharide substrates such as chitin, 1,3-β-glucan, xylan and pectin. Indeed, differently from other fungal CPPs and similarly to expansins, FgCPPs are trapped by cellulose and not by chitin, thus suggesting that these proteins interact with cellulose. A double knock-out mutant deleted of both FgCPPs encoding genes produces much more cellulase activity than the corresponding wild type strain when grown on CMC, likely compensating the absence of FgCPPs. This result prompted us to investigate a possible synergistic effect of these proteins with fungal cellulases. The incubation of FgCPPs in the presence of a fungal cellulase (EC 3.2.1.4) determines an increased enzymatic activity on CMC, filter paper and wheat cell walls. The observation that FgCPPs act with a non-hydrolytic mechanism indicates that these proteins favor fungal cellulase activity in an expansin-like manner. Though the disruption of the FgCPP genes had no demonstrable impact on fungal virulence, our experimental data suggest their probable involvement in virulence, thus we refer to them as accessory virulence genes. Our results suggest also that the FgCPPs could be exploited for future biotechnological application in second-generation biofuels production on lignocellulosic biomasses rich in cellulose. Finally, we demonstrate that FgCPPs act as elicitors of defense responses on Arabidopsis leaves, increasing resistance to Botrytis cinerea infections."

However, the precise mechanism by which Nrf2 regulates inflammation and metabolism in macrophages remains controversial and unclear. To further clarify the roles of Nrf2 in inflammation and glucose metabolism regulation, retrovirus-mediated knockdown of Nrf2 was performed in murine RAW264.7 macrophages, and the cells were stimulated with 100 ng/mL lipopolysaccharide for 24 h for M1 activation. qPCR and western blotting results indicated that Nrf2 knockdown significantly enhanced expression of the inflammatory genes Il1a and Il1b in unstimulated macrophages and increased expression of the inflammatory genes Il1a, Il1b, Il6, Il10, Ccl2, Ccl22, and CD38 but decreased that of Tnfa and Tgfb1 in M1 macrophages. Nrf2 knockdown also significantly elevated IL6 and IL10 secretion by M1 macrophages. Western blotting showed that Nrf2 knockdown reduced iNOS protein levels in resting macrophages and enhanced CD38 protein levels in both resting and M1 macrophages. The differential regulation of these macrophage inflammation and polarization markers by Nrf2 reveals multiple roles for Nrf2 in regulating inflammation in macrophages. Moreover, Nrf2 knockdown increased the Glu4 protein level and decreased AKT and GSK3β protein phosphorylation in M1 macrophages, suggesting multiple roles for Nrf2 in regulating glucose metabolism in macrophages. Overall, our results are the first to demonstrate mixed inflammation and glucose metabolism regulatory effects of Nrf2 in macrophages that may occur independent of its classic function in redox regulation. These findings support the potential of Nrf2 as a therapeutic target for the prevention and treatment of inflammation- and obesity-associated syndromes, including diabetes and atherosclerosis.",,,,2019 05 21,,Vulnerable plaque and vulnerable blood: Two critical factors for spontaneous atherothrombosis in mouse models.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30913516,Atherosclerosis,2019 04 30,"Atherothrombotic events such as myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke are a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Understanding the molecular and cellular mechanisms of atherosclerotic plaque destabilization or erosion, and developing new therapeutics to prevent acute cardiovascular events is important for vascular biology research and clinical cardiovascular medicine. However, basic research on plaque destabilization, rupture and erosion is hampered by the lack of appropriate animal models of atherothrombosis. Unprovoked atherothrombosis is very scarce in commonly used mouse models for atherosclerosis, the low-density lipoprotein receptor knockout and apolipoprotein E knockout mice. Therefore, specific interventions are required to induce atherothrombosis in these models. Two strategies can be employed to induce atherothrombosis: 1) plaque destabilization and 2) induction of blood hypercoagulability. Although the individual strategies yield atherothrombosis at low incidence, it appears that the combination of both plaque destabilization and an increase in blood coagulability is the most promising strategy to induce atherothrombosis on a larger scale. In this review, we summarize the recent developments on mouse models for the investigation of atherothrombosis.",Role of complexing agents on oxidative degradation of chlorophenolic compounds by pyrite-Fenton process: Batch and column experiments.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30913513,Journal of hazardous materials,2019 06 03,"This study involves batch reactor and fixed-bed continuous flow experiments to determine the effects of complexing agents (e.g., tartrate and citrate) on the treatment of chlorophenolic (CP) compounds using heterogeneous Fenton system with pyrite mineral as the iron source. While the addition of organic ligands to the batch systems adversely affected CP removal, organic ligands had a beneficial effect on CP removal in column systems. Although the ligands extended the life span of pyrite-packed columns by removing surface oxidation products through the formation of soluble Fe-ligand complexes, the ligands competed against CPs for hydroxyl radicals (HO*). The competitive effect was much higher in batch systems since pyrite loading was very low in order to generate sufficient hydroxyl radicals. On the other hand, at much higher pyrite loading of column experiments, the HO* radicals generated during Fenton process were sufficient to overcome the competitive effect exerted by organic ligands. In spite of much higher Fe solubility in the presence of citrate, citrate was less effective in enhancing CP removal in column systems compared to tartrate since the competitive effect caused by citrate for HO* radicals was more than that exerted by tartrate.",Does intraspecific variability matter in ecological risk assessment? Investigation of genotypic variations in three macrophyte species exposed to copper.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30913512,"Aquatic toxicology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",2019 05 10,"To limit anthropogenic impact on ecosystems, regulations have been implemented along with global awareness that human activities are harmful to the environment. Ecological risk assessment (ERA) is the main procedure which allows to assess potential impacts of stressors on the environment as a result of human activities. ERA is typically implemented through different steps of laboratory testing. The approaches taken for ERA evolve along with scientific knowledge, to improve predictions on ecological risks for ecosystems. We here address the importance of intraspecific variability as a potential source of error in the laboratory evaluation of pollutants. To answer this question, three aquatic macrophyte species with different life-history traits but with their leaves directly in contact with the water were chosen; Lemna minor and Myriophyllum spicatum, two OECD model species, and Ceratophyllum demersum. For each species, three or four genotypes were exposed to 7-8 copper concentrations (up to 1.9 mg/L, 2 mg/L or 36 mg/L for C. demersum, L. minor and M. spicatum, respectively). To assess species sensitivity, growth-related endpoints such as Relative Growth Rate (RGR), based either on biomass production or on length/frond production, and chlorophyll fluorescence Fv/Fm, were measured. For each endpoint, the effective concentration 50% (EC50) was calculated. Almost all endpoints were affected by Cu exposure, except Fv/Fm of M. spicatum, and resulted in significant differences among genotypes for Cu sensitivity. Genotypes of L. minor exhibited up to 35% of variation in EC50 values based on Fv/Fm, showing differential sensivity among genotypes. Significant differences in EC50 values were found for RGR based on length for M. spicatum, with up to 72% of variation. Finally, C. demersum demonstrated significant sensitivity differences among genotypes with up to 78% variation for EC50 based on length. Overall, interspecific variation was higher than intraspecific variation, and explained 77% of the variation found among genotypes for RGR based on biomass, and 99% of the variation found for Fv/Fm. Our results highlight that depending on the endpoint, sensitivity can vary greatly within a species, and that pollutant- and species-specific endpoints should be considered in ERA.",Dysregulation as a correlate of cannabis use and problem use.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30913511,Addictive behaviors,2019 06 01,"Cannabis users with a dysregulatory risk factor may be particularly vulnerable to engaging in more frequent and problematic cannabis use.

C-reactive protein (CRP) has been chosen as a model biomarker. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first trial using the inorganic component---phosphate ions of BSA-Ab2-Cu3(PO4)2 for transducing electrochemical readout, which features the following advantages: (1) the three-dimensional hierarchical porous nanoflower morphology with a high specific surface area could load more antibodies, and BSA for blocking non-specific sites, greatly increasing the sensitivity of the fabricated immunosensors, (2) the Cu3(PO4)2 hybrid nanoflowers can supply a huge amount of phosphate anions to react with molybdate yielding molybdophosphate precipitates and generating redox currents for more robust enzyme-free electrochemical signal readout.

To realize the high-performance of our PEC bioanalysis system, rational introduction of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and Au nanoparticles (Au NPs) greatly accelerated the electron transfer and enhances photoactivity. As expected, the ternary nanocomposite (i.e., rGO-Bi2WO6-Au) system with cascade energy level exhibited intense PEC signal responses thanks to multistep electron-transfer (MET) mechanism. Upon sensing the target Kana, t-bHCR is readily implemented, thus resulting in the assembly of numerous CuS nanoparticle (CuS NP). As a result, the loading CuS NPs from hyper-branched structure boosted the electron donors (ascorbic acid) consumption and enhanced the steric hindrance, synergistically decrease the photoelectric response. Under the optimized testing conditions, the t-bHCR-based PEC bioanalysis exhibited superior analytical performance with a linear range of 1 pM to 5 nM target Kana and limit of detection down to 0.78 pM. Additionally, favorable stability, great anti-interference ability and satisfactory accuracy for the analysis of actual samples were acquired. Impressively, the concept of t-bHCR-mediated provides an alternative to construct PEC bioanalysis and inspire more interest in the design of advanced PEC bioanalysis through nucleic acid-related signal amplification.","Multi-analytic study of a probable case of fibrous dysplasia (FD) from certosa monumental cemetery (Bologna, Italy).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30913508,International journal of paleopathology,2019 06 10,"To evaluate, via a multidisciplinary approach, a distinctive paleopathological condition believed to be fibrous dysplasia, found on a 19th/20th century skeleton from Certosa Monumental Cemetery, Bologna, Italy."

We tested correlations between individual GMV and single word reading and found none. After dividing this sample into groups based on age and on sex, we only found results in the group aged 15-22: positive correlations between GMV in left fusiform gyrus and reading, driven by females; and in right superior temporal gyrus in males. Multiple regressions also yielded no results, demonstrating that there is no general linear relationship between GMV and single real word reading ability. This provides an important context by which to interpret findings of GMV differences in dyslexia.",Polyelectrolyte complex from cationized casein and sodium alginate for fragrance controlled release.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30913496,"Colloids and surfaces. B, Biointerfaces",2019 05 22,"CA/NaAlg polyelectrolyte complex (PEC) novelly obtained from cationized casein (CA) and sodium alginate (NaAlg) via electrostatic interactions was designed for fragrance (vanillin) controlled release. Structural variation between pristine CA/NaAlg PEC and vanillin-loaded CA/NaAlg PEC were investigated by ultraviolet (UV), fourier transform infrared (FI-TR) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Pristine CA/NaAlg PEC and vanillin-loaded CA/NaAlg PEC were demonstrated spherical in shape by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) showed that PEC's encapsulating could enhance the stability of vanillin whilst the vanillin encapsulation efficiency was 41.39% and the vanillin loading efficiency was 19.83%. The data also proved sustained release of vanillin in vitro.

Transdermal drug delivery is hypothesized as an alternative to conventional therapies to alleviate its adverse effects. In our study, MTX was entrapped in deformable liposomes and loaded in a hydroxyethyl cellulose gel. This system was evaluated by the Box Behnken statistical design for optimization. The effect of formulation variables on particle size, entrapment and ex vivo skin permeation was studied. The MTX nanogel was evaluated for its dermal toxicity (acute and repeat dose safety), in vivo biodistribution (using 125I radio-labelled MTX) and therapeutic efficacy (collagen induced arthritis [CIA] model). The optimized formulation demonstrated appreciable nanosize (110 ± 20 nm), drug entrapment (42 ± 1.9%) and high ex vivo transdermal flux (17.37 ± 1.5 μg/cm2/hr). In the dermal toxicity studies, nanogel formulation did not show any signs of irritation or toxicity, whereas in the biodistribution study, the MTX nanogel formulation depicted sustained systemic delivery up to 48 h with low accumulation in its organs of toxicity such as the liver, kidneys and gut. In the CIA model, the MTX nanogel significantly ameliorated hind paw swelling, reduced arthritic score, joint damage (histological, radiological examination) and attenuated the rise in serum cytokines such as TNF-ɑ and IL-6. In conclusion, the optimized MTX nanogel formulation displayed skin biocompatibility, sustained systemic delivery, safety as well as therapeutic efficacy.",Collagen facilitates the colorectal cancer stemness and metastasis through an integrin/PI3K/AKT/Snail signaling pathway.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30913493,Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,2019 04 30,"Dynamic remodeling of the extracellular matrix (ECM) around tumor cells is crucial for the tumor progressions.

Liquid crystal (LC) polymer deposition was strategically manipulated at the air-LC interface, by controlling the drying temperature and initial concentration of aqueous solution of xanthan gum in a limited space. Interface-assisted orientation led to membrane-like depositions bridging the millimeter-scale gap between the substrates both, vertically and horizontally. The applicability of this approach lies in synchronization of the molecular orientation beyond their individual LC domains into the condensed state. Cross-polarized microscopy and SEM analysis correlated the orientation of the deposited polymer with the controlled mobility of xanthan gum LC domains at the evaporative interface. Subsequently, a phase diagram was prepared for the variety of oriented structures, depending upon the drying conditions. The deposited membrane behaved as an oriented hydrogel showing reversible anisotropic swelling/deswelling only along its thickness.","NanoTiO2@DNA complex: a novel eco, durable, fire retardant design strategy for cotton textiles.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30913491,Journal of colloid and interface science,2019 04 16,"A strategy for the design of cotton flame retardant coatings is described, exploiting the natural intumescent formulation of nucleic acids, the intrinsic thermal inertia of TiO2 ceramic phase and the strong affinity that TiO2 nanoparticles shows for amphiphilic biomolecules (e.g. proteins, nucleic acids) and hydrophilic substrates. Two different self-assembled TiO2@DNA systems are obtained by mixing two opposite charged TiO2 nanoparticles suspensions with DNA solution. The colloidal behavior of separate and mixed phases was investigated, as well as the morphological, chemical structure and thermal properties of resulting coatings, in order to make some hypothesis on the observed synergic effects. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Attenuated Total Reflectance (ATR) spectroscopy demonstrated the homogeneous distribution of nano-TiO2@DNA based coatings on the treated fabrics. The washing fastness tests evidenced the highly improved performance of hybrid coatings if compared with DNA alone. The flammability and cone calorimetry test results confirmed this positive synergy that resulted quite effective in slowing down (or even blocking) the propagation of a flame within the treated substrates and in improving the resistance of the fabrics to the applied heat flux, these latter leaving increased residues at the end of the test.",Impact of the morphological and chemical properties of copper-zirconium-SBA-15 catalysts on the conversion and selectivity in carbon dioxide hydrogenation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30913490,Journal of colloid and interface science,2019 04 16,"A hybrid catalyst consisting of Zr-doped mesoporous silica (Zr-SBA-15) supports with intergrown Cu nanoparticles was used to study the effects of a catalyst's chemical states on CO2 hydrogenation. The chemical state of the catalyst was altered by using tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) or sodium metasilicate (SMS) as the silica precursor in the synthesis of the Zr-SBA-15 framework, and infiltration (Inf) or evaporation induced wetness impregnation (EIWI) as the Cu loading method. As a result, the silica precursor mainly affects the activity of the catalyst whereas the Cu loading method alters the selectivity of the products. TEOS materials exhibit a higher catalytic activity compared to SMS materials due to different Zr dispersion and bonding to the silica matrix. EIWI catalysts display selectivity for methanol formation, while the Inf ones enable methanol conversion to DME. This is correlated to a higher Zr content and lower Cu oxidation states of EIWI prepared catalysts.",Boosting the low-temperature activity and sulfur tolerance of CeZr2Ox catalysts by antimony addition for the selective catalytic reduction of NO with ammonia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30913489,Journal of colloid and interface science,2019 04 16,"In this paper, a series of Sb modified CeZr2Ox mixed oxides (SbyCZ) were synthesized by citrate method for the selective catalytic reduction of NO with ammonia (NH3-SCR). Experimental results exhibited that the Sb addition could bring a great improvement of SCR activity at 200-360 °C owing to the enhancement in surface area, redox ability and surface acidity. More importantly, the sulfur tolerance of the catalyst with proper Sb loading contents was dramatically improved. For instance, above 85% deNOx efficiency was retained over Sb0.5CZ catalyst after 24 h reaction in the presence of 100 ppm SO2 and 5 vol.% H2O. As for pure CeZr2Ox and the catalysts with low Sb loading contents, the serious accumulation of ammonium sulfates resulted in the deactivation after SO2 exposure. However, with excessive Sb addition, more labile oxygen readily reacted with SO2 and the redox cycle was then disrupted, leading to the decrease of SCR activity. With an appropriate Sb loading contents, the sulfate species preferentially formed around Sb cations could restrain the further consumption of oxygen species in Ce-O-Ce or Ce-O-Zr mode by SO2 via a space confinement effect. Thus, a certain amount of labile oxygen was preserved to drive the SCR reaction, thereby enhancing the sulfur tolerance of the catalyst.","A regularly combined magnetic 3D hierarchical Fe3O4/BiOBr heterostructure: Fabrication, visible-light photocatalytic activity and degradation mechanism.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30913488,Journal of colloid and interface science,2019 04 16,"The magnetic Fe3O4/BiOBr composites with different molar ratios were prepared by a new two-step method.

When the molar ratio of Fe3O4 nanospheres and BiOBr nanosheets is 0.5:1, the two are combined regularly to form 3D flower-like hierarchical heterostructure. This phenomenon is firstly found and can provide a reference for synthesizing other regularly combined magnetic heterostructure catalysts. The degradation activity for Rhodamine B (RhB) is much stronger than that of the previous studies under visible-light irradiation. 3D flower-like Fe3O4/BiOBr (0.5:1) heterostructure possesses great advantages including excellent magnetic separation, remarkable reutilization and stability. Through active species detection and liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis, the degradation mechanisms of RhB are summarized (a) RhB photosensitization and (b) RhB moleculs attacked by radicals and a new possible degradation path was to be presented.

Studying several thin film systems including Co/W(110), Co/Cu(001) and (Co/Ni)n/W(110), we show that an additional contrast can appear at magnetic DWs. By imaging the magnetization as a function of electron landing energy, electron energies are selected at which the magnetic domain contrast vanishes. Surprisingly, under such conditions of zero contrast between magnetic domains, we observe the appearance of magnetic contrast outlining the DWs. This DW contrast does not depend on the DW spin texture. Instead, our measurements show that this DW contrast results from a combination of the energy-dependence of the spin reflectivity asymmetry of the magnetic film, the finite energy width of the spin polarized electron source, and the dispersion of the magnetic prism array that separates the illumination and imaging columns of the instrument.

Although TPEN of often used as a selective zinc chelators, it has affinity for copper and iron and has been shown to chelate both biologically. We have previously shown that TPEN selectively kills colon cancer cells based on its ability to chelate copper, which is highly enriched in colon cancer cells. The TPEN-copper complex is redox active thus allowing for increased ROS production in cancer cells and as such cellular toxicity. Here we generate TPEN derivatives with the goal of increasing its selectivity for copper while minimizing zinc chelation to reduce potential side effects. We show that one of these derivatives, TPEEN despite the fact that it exhibits reduced affinity for transition metals, is effective at inducing cell death in breast cancer cells, and exhibits less toxicity to normal breast cells. The toxicity effect of the both chelators coupled to the metal content of the different cell types reveals that they exhibit their toxicity through chelating redox active metals (iron and copper).

This determines not only its pharmacokinetic properties but also its biochemical effects in humans, including its recently-discovered antiproliferative properties. The aim of the study was to verify the hypothesis whether chemical modification of its biguanide backbone may increase the cellular uptake and antiproliferative efficacy of metformin. The study examines five sulfenamide derivatives of metformin with differing lengths of alkyl chains. It determines their cellular uptake and the role of OCTs in their transport in human breast adenocarcinoma cells (epithelial-like MCF-7, and MDA-MB-231). It also evaluates whether increased cellular uptake of metformin derivatives is associated with their cytotoxic properties. Sulfenamide derivatives were characterized by a greater ability to bind to OCTs than metformin. Compound 2 with n-octyl alkyl chain was found to possess the greatest affinity towards OCTs, as measured by determination of [14C]choline uptake inhibition (IC50 = 236.1 ± 1.28 μmol/L, and 217.4 ± 1.33 μmol/L, for MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 respectively). Sulfenamides were also found to exhibit better cellular uptake in comparison with the parent drug, metformin. For instance, the uptake of cyclohexyl derivative 1 was 1.28 ± 0.19 nmol/min/mg of proteins and thus was 12-fold higher than the metformin in MCF-7 cells. Furthermore, higher uptake was associated with the greatest antiproliferative properties expressed as the lowest IC50 value i.e. inhibiting the growth of 50% of the cells (IC50 = 0.72 ± 1.31 μmol/L). Collectively, chemical modification of metformin into sulfenamides with different alkyl substituents obtains better substrates for OCTs, and subsequently higher cellular uptake in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. Additionally, the length of alkyl chain introduced to the sulfenamides was found to influence selectivity and transport efficiency via OCT1 compared to other possible transporters, as well as potential intracellular activity and cytotoxicity."

SE is modeled in rodents by systemic injection of chemoconvulsants such as pilocarpine, which induces EEG and behavioral activities similar to what seen in humans. Combined injection of diazepam and ketamine is commonly used to terminate SE in rodents but, to date, no study has analysed the EEG activity and behavior during SE and after diazepam + ketamine administration. We therefore performed EEG recordings from the hippocampal CA3 region of mice before and during pilocarpine-induced SE as well as for 24 h after injection of diazepam + ketamine. We found that although convulsive behavior disappeared within 5.5 min ( ± 1.12 min; n = 5) after diazepam + ketamine treatment, EEG epileptiform activity resembling what seen during SE persisted up to 278.8 min ( ± 262.0 min). The end of this SE-like EEG pattern was characterised by transition to high amplitude, persisting interictal spikes. Our findings show that (i) administration of diazepam and ketamine stops behavioral but not EEG epileptiform activity associated to pilocarpine-induced SE; and (ii) such SE-like EEG pattern persists for approx. 4 h to be replaced by interictal spikes that predominate during the so called latent period in this model of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy.",Emerging therapeutic targets for patients with advanced prostate cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30913454,Cancer treatment reviews,2019 06 14,"Although recent advances in the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) have significantly improved patient outcomes, advanced prostate cancer is still associated with substantial morbidity and mortality, particularly in patients who develop resistance after multiple lines of therapy.

Low-frequency rTMS was significantly less intense than high-frequency rTMS in overall intensity, pain, muscle twitching (all p < .01) and discomfort (p < .001). Limitations of this study include the healthy participant sample and administration of a single session of rTMS. While further work is needed in clinical samples using typical rTMS treatment protocols, these data provide the first evidence that low-frequency is better tolerated than high-frequency. These findings may inform clinical practice of rTMS treatment for depression (and other illnesses) by supporting the application of low-frequency protocols.",Human ehrlichiosis at a tertiary-care academic medical center: Clinical associations and outcomes of transplant patients and patients with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30913447,"Blood cells, molecules & diseases",2019 05 15,Ehrlichiosis is an acute febrile tick-borne disease which can rarely be a trigger for secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH).,The legacy lead deposition in soils and its impact on cognitive function in preschool-aged children in the United States.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30913446,Economics and human biology,2019 04 27,"Surface soil contamination has been long recognized as an important pathway of human lead exposure, and is now a worldwide health concern. This study estimates the causal effects of exposure to lead in topsoil on cognitive ability among 5-year-old children. We draw on individual level data from the 2000 U.S. Census, and USGS data on lead in topsoil covering a broad set of counties across the United States. Using an instrumental variable approach relying on the 1944 Interstate Highway System Plan, we find that higher lead in topsoil increases considerably the probability of 5-year-old boys experiencing cognitive difficulties such as learning, remembering, concentrating, or making decisions. Living in counties with topsoil lead concentration above the national median roughly doubles the probability of 5-year-old boys having cognitive difficulties. Nevertheless, it does not seem to affect 5-year-old girls, consistent with previous studies. Importantly, the adverse effects of lead exposure on boys are found even in counties with levels of topsoil lead concentration considered low by the guidelines from the U.S. EPA and state agencies. These findings are concerning because they suggest that legacy lead may continue to impair cognition today, both in the United States and in other countries that have considerable lead deposition in topsoil."

The QQ bacteria showed efficient mitigation of TMP increase in different membrane fouling stages. In the control MBR group, the TMP reached 43 kPa on the 4th day, while in the experimental group, TMP of QQ-MBR was only 18 kPa at the same time. The detection result of EPS and SMP content of protein and polysaccharide in MBRs showed that QQ bacteria had significant inhibitory effects on EPS and SMP. Also, the QQ bacterial exhibited excellent AHLs degradation rate in MBR reaction tank.",Improvement of continuous hydrogen production using individual and binary enzymatic hydrolysates of agave bagasse in suspended-culture and biofilm reactors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30913433,Bioresource technology,2019 04 14,"Continuous hydrogen (H2) production from individual (Stonezyme, IH) and binary (Celluclast-Viscozyme, BH) enzymatic hydrolysates of agave bagasse was evaluated in continuous stirred-tank reactors (CSTR) and trickling bed reactors (TBR). The volumetric H2 production rates (VHPR) in CSTR were 13 and 2.25 L H2/L-d with BH and IH, respectively. Meanwhile, VHPR of 5.76 and 2.0 L H2/L-d were obtained in the TBR configuration using BH and IH, respectively. Differences on VHPR between reactors could be explained by substrate availability, which is intrinsic to the growth mode of each reactor configuration; while differences of VHPR between hydrolysates were possibly related to the composition of enzymatic hydrolysates. Furthermore, homoacetogenesis was strongly influenced by H2 and substrate transfer conditions. Considering VHPR, H2 yields, and costs of hydrolysis, hydrogen production from binary hydrolysates of agave bagasse was identified as the most promising alternative evaluated with scale-up potential for the production of energy biofuels.",A highly efficient step-wise biotransformation strategy for direct conversion of phytosterol to boldenone.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30913432,Bioresource technology,2019 04 14,"Collaborative microbial communities are ubiquitous in nature and exhibit appealing functions for enhanced production of natural products, which provides new possibility for biotechnology development. In this study, we bridged Mycobacterium neoaurum with Pichia pastoris to establish a step-wise biotransformation strategy for efficient biosynthesis of boldenone (BD) from phytosterol (PS). Firstly, the producing strains were rationally designed with overexpression of 3-ketosteroid-Δ1-dehydrogenase (KsdD) and 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17βHSD) in M. neoaurum and P. pastoris, respectively. Then, to shorten the total biotransformation process and provide reducing power, semi-batch fermentation strategy and glucose supplementation strategy were introduced at side-chain degradation stage and carbonyl reduction stage, respectively. Under the optimal transformation conditions, the productivity of BD was increased from 10% to 76% and the total biotransformation process was shortened by 41.7%, which is the shortest among the ever reported. Our results demonstrated an excellent biological strategy for production of many other valuable microbial products from bioresources.",Co-digestion of Theobroma cacao (Cocoa) pod husk and poultry manure for energy generation: Effects of pretreatment methods.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30913431,Bioresource technology,2019 04 14,"In this study, biogas was produced from the anaerobic co-digestion of Cocoa pod husk (CPH) and poultry manure. Pretreatment of the CPH was carried out using sulfuric acid and hydrogen peroxide. The physicochemical, elemental and structural analyses were carried out on the CPH before and after pretreatment. The microbial composition of the fermenting materials were also determined using standard method while the Fourier Transform Infra-red (FTIR) spectroscopy was used to identify the structural changes that took place after pretreatments. Use of alkaline hydrogen peroxide caused high solubilization of the lignin component of the CPH and reduced up to 81% of lignin i.e. initial value of 21.7% m.m-1 to final value of 4.2% m.m-1. Similarly, the alkali reduced the hemicellulose content of the CPH from 27.0% m.m-1 to 8.5% m.m-1. Overall, there was 68% increase in biogas volume from the alkaline pretreated CPH.",Efficient acetogenesis of anaerobic co-digestion of food waste and maize straw in a HSAD reactor.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30913430,Bioresource technology,2019 04 14,"In this study, food waste and maize straw were used as feedstock, and the two-phase high-solid anaerobic digestion (TP-HSAD) technology was used to optimize the process parameters of leachate reflux in acid-production stage. Results indicated that compared with other waste activated sludge, pig manure digestate (PM) as leachate can achieve better hydrolysis and acidification effect. The increase of leachate reflux ratio can shorten the fermentation time of the acid-producing stage and increase the fermentation efficiency. When the reflux ratio was 32:1, peak concentration of volatile fatty acids (VFAs) was 45.4 g/L and the volatile solids (VS) removal rate was 61.7%. Reflux frequency has minimal effect on the concentration of VFAs and the degree of degradation of VS, but a higher reflux frequency will prolong the reaction time of acid-production stage. When PM is used as reflux leachate, the HSAD reactor can improve the hydrolysis and acidification of the anaerobic fermentation.",Removal of anionic arsenate by a PEI-coated bacterial biosorbent prepared from fermentation biowaste.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30913429,Chemosphere,2019 05 07,"As a problematic element in water systems, arsenic exists as As(III) and As(V). Adsorption techniques can be used to remove anionic As(V) as it is present as a polyatomic anion. In the case of As(III) which exists in zero-valent state under neutral pH, it can be also removed by adsorption after being converted into As(V). Many inorganic and organic materials have been examined as potential adsorbents for anionic As(V) removal. However, most exhibit relatively low adsorption capacities (<10 mg/g). The objective of this study is to examine As(V)-removal mechanism and practical potential of a PEI-coated bacterial biosorbent prepared from fermentation biowaste. The maximum As(V) uptake of the biosorbent was determined to be 62.99 mg/g by Langmuir model. The effects of various parameters including pH, biosorbent dosage, ionic strength and temperature were also examined. Kinetic and equilibrium models were used to interpret the experimental data mathematically. A 0.01 M NaOH solution was chosen as an effective As(V)-desorbing eluent for biosorbent regeneration. The adsorption capacity of the biosorbent remained above 85% over three successive cycles of adsorption and desorption. In conclusion, the biowaste-driven biosorbent is a promising anion adsorbent for treatment of As(V)-contaminated wasters.",Dissipation kinetic studies of fenamidone and propamocarb in vegetables under greenhouse conditions using liquid and gas chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30913426,Chemosphere,2019 05 07,"In this study, fenamidone, propamocarb and their transformation products were monitored in cherry tomato, cucumber, and courgette samples. A mixture of both compounds, which have different physico-chemical characteristics, are commercially available (Consento®). For analysis, ultra high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to Orbitrap mass spectrometry (UHPLC-Orbitrap-MS) and gas chromatography coupled to Q-Orbitrap mass spectrometry (GC-Q-Orbitrap-MS) were used. The dissipation of these active ingredients was monitored at two doses (normal and double dose) from 1 to 40 days after the application of the commercial product. Half-lives (DT50) were lower than 30 days for both compounds, which indicates low persistence. Metabolites of both compounds were also monitored due to in some cases these can be more dangerous for human health than the parent compounds. The metabolites monitored were RPA 410193 ((5S)-3-anilino-5-methyl-5-phenylimidazolidine-2,4-dione), acetophenone, 2-phenylpropionic acid, 5-methyl-5-phenylhydantoin and 5-methylhydantoin for fenamidone, and propamocarb hydrochloride (propyl 3-(dimethylamino)propylcarbamate hydrochloride), N-oxide propamocarb (propyl [3-(dimethylnitroryl)propyl]carbamate), oxazoline-2-one propamocarb (3-[3-(dimethylamino)propyl]-4-hydroxy-4-methyl-1,3-oxazolidin-2-one), 2-hydroxypropamocarb and n-desmethyl propamocarb (propyl [3-(methylamino)propyl]carbamate) for propamocarb. In addition, they were detected one day after the application of commercial product, being RPA 410193, the metabolite detected at the highest concentration in samples. Retrospective analysis of incurred samples allowed putative identification of four possible new metabolites of propamocarb and one of fenamidone.",Methane biodegradation and enhanced methane solubilization by the filamentous fungi Fusarium solani.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30913425,Chemosphere,2019 05 07,"Methane is one of the most important greenhouse gases emitted from natural and human activities. It is scarcely soluble in water; thus, it has a low bioavailability for microorganisms able to degrade it. In this work, the capacity of the fungus Fusarium solani to improve the solubility of methane in water and to biodegrade methane was assayed. Experiments were performed in microcosms with vermiculite as solid support and mineral media, at temperatures between 20 and 35 °C and water activities between 0.9 and 0.95, using pure cultures of F. solani and a methanotrophic consortium (Methylomicrobium album and Methylocystis sp) as a control. Methane was the only carbon and energy source. Results indicate that using thermally inactivated biomass of F. solani, decreases the partition coefficient of methane in water up to two orders of magnitude. Moreover, F. solani can degrade methane, in fact at 35 °C and the highest water activity, the methane degradation rate attained by F. solani was 300 mg m-3 h-1, identical to the biodegradation rate achieved by the consortium of methanotrophic bacteria.",Toddlers' understanding and use of verbal negation in inferential reasoning search tasks.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30913424,Journal of experimental child psychology,2019 04 14,"Past research has demonstrated that young children and nonhuman animals are able to reason by elimination (""If not A, then B"") by relying on visual cues such as seeing that one container is empty. Other research has shown that young children can solve similar, simple inferential reasoning tasks where ""emptiness"" is conveyed verbally through negation (e.g., ""The toy is not in the box""). However, it is unclear whether these tasks involved reasoning through the disjunctive syllogism, which requires the representation of logical negation (NOT A) and disjunction (A OR B) or simpler, nondeductive strategies. In Study 1, we extended this work by investigating whether 2-year-olds can infer the location of a toy in typical two-location elimination trials, when given both affirmative and negative sentences, and more complex three-location trials, when information about emptiness was conveyed verbally and visually. Younger 2-year-olds performed significantly better on the search task when hearing affirmative than negative sentences, whereas older 2-year-olds were equally successful with both types of sentences. Study 2 examined children's ability to use verbal negation to solve a more complex deductive task involving disjunctive syllogism. Results showed that, in this linguistic version of the disjunctive reasoning task, both 2.5- and 3-year-olds made accurate inferences about the location of a reward, unlike prior (nonlinguistic) evidence that demonstrated this ability in 3-year-olds but not in younger children. We conclude that by the end of their second year of life, children have a robust understanding of negation which they can apply in abstract reasoning.",Developmental changes in the perception of audiotactile simultaneity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30913423,Journal of experimental child psychology,2019 04 14,"We charted the developmental trajectory of the perception of audiotactile simultaneity by testing three groups of children (aged 7, 9, and 11 years) and one group of adults. A white noise burst and a tap to the index finger were presented at 1 of 13 stimulus onset asynchronies (SOAs), and the participants were asked to report whether the two stimuli were simultaneous. Compared with adults, 7-year-olds made significantly more simultaneous responses at 9 of the 13 SOAs, whereas 9-year-olds differed from adults at only 2 SOAs. The precision of simultaneity perception was lower, and response errors were higher, in younger children than in adults. The 11-year-olds were adult-like on all measures, thereby demonstrating that judgments about simultaneity for audiotactile stimuli are mature by 11 years. This developmental pattern is similar to that for simultaneity perception for visuotactile stimuli but later than that for audiovisual stimuli. The longer developmental trajectories of the perception of simultaneity between touch and vision and between touch and audition may arise from the need to coordinate and recalibrate between different reference frames and different neural transmission times in each sensory system during body growth; in addition, the ubiquity of audiovisual experience in everyday life may accelerate the development of that modality pairing."
