MicroRNAs are small noncoding RNAs involved in cancer progression; however, their utility as predictors of pathological complete response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy is unclear. Here, we investigated if miR-143 could discriminate between pathological complete response and no-polymerase chain reaction of patients with locally advanced triple negative breast cancer that have received a fluorouracil-cisplatin/paclitaxel-based neoadjuvant treatment. Data showed that miR-143 exhibited a significant low expression ( P < .0006) in patients that achieved pathological complete response in comparison to nonresponder group. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis suggested that miR-143 could be a good predictor of pathological complete response (area under curve = 0.849, P < .0006). Moreover, Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated that before neoadjuvant therapy low levels of miR-143 were associated to increased disease free survival. To gain insights into cellular functions of miR-143, we firstly showed that miR-143 was severely repressed in breast cancer cell lines and tumors in comparison to normal mammary cells and tissues. Ectopic restoration of miR-143 using RNA mimics inhibited both cell proliferation and migration and sensitized breast cancer cells to cisplatin therapy in vitro. To decipher the signaling networks regulated by miR-143, we used a high-throughput enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based phosphorylation antibody array. Phospho-proteomic profiling revealed that miR-143 coordinately reduced the protein levels and phosphorylation status of multiple oncoproteins involved in AKT, WNT/β-catenin, SAPK/JNK, FAK, and JAK/STAT signaling pathways. Moreover, low miR-143 and high GSK3-β, RAF1, paxillin, and p21CIP1 expression levels in a large cohort of patients with breast cancer were associated with worst outcome. In summary, miR-143 could be a potential predictor of response to neoadjuvant therapy and it may function as a divergent regulator of diverse signaling networks to suppress cell proliferation and migration in breast cancer.",The influence of maternal and perinatal high-fat diet on ozone-induced pulmonary responses in offspring.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30755101,Journal of toxicology and environmental health. Part A,2019 03 01,"There is growing interest in understanding how maternal diet might affect the sensitivity of offspring to environmental exposures. Previous studies demonstrated that adult rat offspring (approximately 6-months-old) from dams given a high-fat diet (HFD) prior to, during, and after pregnancy displayed elevated pulmonary responses to an acute ozone (O3) exposure. The aim of this study was to examine the influence of maternal and perinatal HFD on pulmonary and metabolic responses to O3 in male and female young-adult offspring (approximately 3-month old). One-month-old F0 female Long-Evans rats commenced HFD (60% kcal from fat) or control diet (CD; 10.5% kcal from fat) and were bred on PND 72. Offspring were maintained on respective HFD or CD until PND 29 when all groups were switched to CD. The 3-months-old female and male offspring (n = 10/group) were exposed to air or 0.8 ppm O3 for 5hr/day for 2 consecutive days. Maternal and perinatal HFD significantly increased body weight and body fat % in offspring regardless of gender. Ozone exposure, but not maternal and perinatal diet, induced hyperglycemia and glucose intolerance in the offspring. Ozone-induced alterations in pulmonary function were exacerbated by maternal and perinatal HFD in both offspring genders. Pulmonary injury/inflammation markers in response to O3 exposure such as bronchoalveolar lavage fluid total protein, lactate dehydrogenase, total cells, and neutrophils were further augmented in offspring (males>females) from dams fed the HFD. Data suggest that maternal and perinatal HFD may enhance the susceptibility of offspring to O3-induced pulmonary injury and that these effects may be sex-specific.",A nine year follow-up study of patients with lymphoedema cholestasis syndrome 1 (LCS1/Aagenaes syndrome).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30755100,Scandinavian journal of clinical and laboratory investigation,2019 04 23,"The risks of developing energy or nutrient deficits are of great concern in infants and children with the rare lymphoedema cholestasis syndrome 1 (LCS1)/Aagenaes syndrome. In adolescents and adults, it is not known whether LCS1 patients need specific dietary advice outside periods of cholestasis. The primary objective of the present study was to evaluate the progression of the liver disease and nutritional status in patients with LCS1 over a period of nine years. Dietary and biochemical data were obtained for patients and healthy controls in two cross-sectional studies, a baseline (2000) and a follow-up study (2009). Thirteen patients above 18 years of age with LCS1 (65%) were included (six females). Dietary intake and biochemical measures were stable in the patients from baseline until follow-up. Compared to healthy controls, the patients had significantly higher serum levels of alkaline phosphatase (p = .015 and p = .002), gamma-glutamyltransferase (p = .001 and p < .001), total bile acids (p = .037 and p = .016), and fibrinogen (p = .046 and p < .001) and lower albumin (p = .033 and p < .001) and α-tocopherol (p = .011 and p = .003) at baseline and follow-up. Despite stable liver function, the presence of a low grade of hepatobiliary dysfunction in these patients was suggested. Patients with LCS1 had a nutritional status similar to healthy controls, with no clinical deterioration of liver function during the nine-year period. The findings presented in this paper support that more than 50% of patients with LCS1 can expect a normal lifespan.",The influence of oxidative stress on cardiac remodeling in obese adolescents.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30755099,Scandinavian journal of clinical and laboratory investigation,2019 04 23,"Oxidative stress seems to be an important link between obesity and cardiovascular disease. The aim of our study was to assess oxidative stress in obese patients stratified according to ambulatory blood pressure status and to determine independent predictors of abnormal left ventricular geometry.A cross-sectional study was conducted. A total of 113 obese participants referred for 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) aged 9-19 years, and 29 healthy controls were enrolled. In addition to anthropometric and biochemical measurements, such as fasting serum levels of glucose, insulin, lipid profile, and oxidative biomarkers, ABPM and echocardiography were performed.According to ABPM results, obese subjects were split in two groups: 57 hypertensive and 56 normotensive. Both hypertensive and normotensive obese participants had higher levels of oxidative stress parameters (pro-oxidative/antioxidative balance and total oxidant status) compared with control group. Levels of superoxide anion (O2-) and sulfhydryl groups were higher in obese hypertensive participants as compared to obese normotensive and control groups. Abnormal left ventricular geometry among obese participants was independently associated with O2- (p = .006) and body mass index z score (p = .020), with no significant impact of gender, while age and systolic blood pressure exhibited interaction term for the outcome.The independent effect of oxidative mechanisms on left ventricular geometry appears to start in childhood. Oxidative stress occurs in obese adolescents prior to the development of sustained hypertension.",Glucose variation in centrifuged serum and lithium-heparin gel tubes stored for up to 96 hours at room temperature or 4 °C.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30755098,Scandinavian journal of clinical and laboratory investigation,2019 04 23,"This study aimed to verify glucose stability within centrifuged serum and lithium-heparin tubes stored at room temperature (RT) or 4 °C. Sixty paired serum (plus gel separator), lithium-heparin (plus gel separator) and K2-EDTA tubes were centrifuged within 30 min from collection. Thirty serum and lithium-heparin tubes were then stored at RT, whilst the other 30 serum and lithium-heparin tubes were kept at 4 °C. Complete cell blood count was performed in serum and plasma after centrifugation, as well as in K2-EDTA paired whole blood tubes. Glucose was measured immediately after centrifugation and 3, 6, 24, 48, 72 and 96 h afterwards. Immeasurable blood cells values were found in serum, whilst residual leukocytes and platelets were present in lithium-heparin plasma. Regardless of storage conditions, glucose concentration decreased 3 h after centrifugation in lithium-heparin tubes, displaying uninterrupted reduction until 96 h. Mean decrease per hour was higher in plasma tubes stored at RT than at 4 °C. Performance specification was exceeded between 6 and 24 h of storage in most plasma tubes. Glucose concentration significantly decreased in serum tubes between 24 and 48 h, regardless of storage conditions. The mean glucose variation never exceeded performance specification throughout the study period. Mean glucose decrease per hour in plasma was not associated with blood cells counts before and after centrifugation, and was probably attributable to the presence of blood cells entrapped within the gel. Delayed glucose measurement in centrifuged serum tubes may be clinically viable up to 96 h, whilst it may be unadvisable in centrifuged lithium-heparin tubes.",Serum sodium level variability as a prognosticator in older adults.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30755097,Scandinavian journal of clinical and laboratory investigation,2019 04 23,"Our aim was to explore biological variation of serum sodium levels as a method of quantifying health risk in older adults. We investigated whether dynamic changes in serum sodium levels could provide additional prognostic information to standard predictors of mortality in older people. Analysis of routinely collected clinical datasets containing information on demographics, hospitalisation, biochemistry, haematology and physical function for Dundee in-patient rehabilitation services, between 1999 and 2011. Older people admitted to inpatient rehabilitation following an acute medical or surgical hospitalisation. Five dynamic measures of sodium levels homeostasis - minimum, maximum, standard deviation, and minimum and maximum deviation from mean - were derived for each individual, using biochemistry data from the year preceding their rehabilitation discharge. Cox regression models tested for associations with time to death. Covariates included age, sex, discharge Barthel score, co-morbid diagnoses, haemoglobin, albumin and eGFR. 3021 patients were included (mean age 84 years, 1776 (58.8%) females). 1651 (54.7%) patients experienced hyponatraemia and 446 (14.8%) became hypernatraemic. Mean sodium was correlated with all mean, minimum and SD of sodium. Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed that those without sodium perturbations had the best mortality outcomes, whilst those with both hyponatremia and hypernatremia had the worst. Multivariate Cox regression showed that standard deviation and hypernatraemia were significant predictors of death in non-adjusted models, but not fully adjusted models. All dynamic measures of dysnatraemia were associated with increased mortality risk, but failed to add predictive value to established static measures after adjusting for covariates.",Modulation of antioxidant enzyme gene expression by extremely low frequency electromagnetic field in post-stroke patients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30755096,Scandinavian journal of clinical and laboratory investigation,2019 04 23,"Oxidative stress plays the most important role in the pathogenesis of stroke. Extremely low frequency electromagnetic field (ELF-EMF) therapy may be complementary in post-stroke therapy, as it modulates oxidative stress. The aim of this study was to evaluate the messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) levels of certain antioxidant genes in post-stroke patients given ELF-EMF therapy. Forty-eight post-stroke patients were divided into two groups: an ELF-EMF group and a non-ELF-EMF group. All patients underwent the same program of physical therapy, but the ELF-EMF group was additionally given ELF-EMF treatment. In order to determine the level of gene expression, we evaluated the level of mRNA expression of catalase, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione peroxidase. We observed that after ELF-EMF therapy, the mRNA expression of the studied genes (CAT, SOD1, SOD2, GPx1, and GPx4) significantly increased, which enhanced the antioxidant defence of the body. ELF-EMF therapy intensifies the endogenous antioxidant system by increasing the mRNA expression of genes encoding antioxidant enzymes and enhances the effectiveness of post-stroke patient therapy.",In vitro and in vivo evaluation of new PRP antibacterial moisturizing dressings for infectious wound repair.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30755095,Journal of biomaterials science. Polymer edition,2019 03 25,"In this study, a solution chitosan fibroin emulsion with added Silver Nanoparticles (AgNPs) was freeze-dried to be the scaffold, and an asymmetric coating was formed on one side. PRP was loaded onto the composite scaffold using a secondary lyophilization technology to prepare the tissue engineering dressings. AgNPs were characterized using a transmission electron microscope. The morphologies of the composite dressing were examined under a scanning electron microscope. The silver content of the dressing was measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The asymmetric wettability of the composite dressing was demonstrated by water contact angle measurement. Relatively high porosity, favourable moisture retention capability and appropriate tensile strength were observed by measuring the physical and mechanical properties. Satisfactory antibacterial properties against various bacteria and microbial isolation performance were observed by the antibacterial effect analysis in vitro. The total protein slow-release property was measured using the BCA assay. Good biocompatibility and lower sensitization were examined both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, the healing effciency of the composite dressing on infected wound were examined in mice infected wound models. Analysis of wound healing rates, bacterial cultures of wound exudate, whole blood cell analysis and histological examination all showed satisfactory results. These results are demonstrated to provide a potential and possible pathway to promote wound tissue repair and regeneration.",Abundance and removal of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in the rearing environments of intensive shrimp aquaculture in South China.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30755094,"Journal of environmental science and health. Part. B, Pesticides, food contaminants, and agricultural wastes",2019 04 24,"Although research regarding antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in aquaculture environments has gained increasing scientific interest, further studies are required to understand the abundances and removal mechanisms of ARGs during the entire rearing period of shrimp aquaculture. Thus, in this study, abundances, distributions and removal rates of ARGs in different environmental compartments of intensive shrimp farms in South China were investigated during the entire rearing period. The results indicated that sul1 and cmlA were the predominant ARGs in the water and sediment samples. Additionally, the total abundance of ARGs was higher in shrimp pond water than in the source water and farm effluent. Moreover, sediment samples indicated significantly higher ARG abundances than water samples from the shrimp ponds (P < 0.05). Environmental factors were found to significantly affect the distribution of ARGs in shrimp rearing environments. Furthermore, stable ponds aided the removal of ARGs from shrimp pond water. This study accounted for temporal variations in ARG abundances as well as removal of ARGs in different environmental compartments during the entire shrimp rearing period. However, additional research is required to optimize the water treatment process for removal of ARGs from the aquaculture.","Development, validation of QuEChERS-based method for simultaneous determination of multiclass pesticide residue in milk, and evaluation of the matrix effect.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30755093,"Journal of environmental science and health. Part. B, Pesticides, food contaminants, and agricultural wastes",2019 05 03,"Extraction and quantification of pesticide residue from the milk matrix at or below the established maximum residue limit (MRL) is a challenging task for both analytical chemists and the regulatory institutions to take corrective actions for the human health and safety. The main aim of the study is to develop a simple rapid and less expensive QuEChERS extraction and cleanup method for simultaneous analysis of 41 multiclass pesticide residue in milk by gas chromatography-electron capture detector (GC-ECD), followed by confirmation of the residues with gas chromatography-mass spectrometer (GC-MS). Effect of sorbent type, temperature, spiking concentration, matrix effect (ME), measurement uncertainty (MU), inter- and intra-assay repeatability, reproducibility of recovery, and trueness of the results were investigated to validate the effectiveness of the method. Limit of determination (LOD) and limit of quantitation (LOQ) for all the analytes ranged within 0.001-0.02 and 0.002-0.05 µg mL-1, respectively. The % recovery of all the pesticides ranged between 91.38 and 117.56% with relative standard deviation (RSD) below 2.79%. The MU for all the analytes was ≤29% of respective LOQs, and except for few pesticides, the ME was largely negative. The method fulfilled all the SANTE guidelines and thus can be extended for routine analysis of multiclass pesticide residue in milk."

Numerous studies have suggested that lamins, the major structural components of the nuclear lamina, play a role in global chromatin organization and gene expression. How lamins could influence the 3D genome organization and transcription from the nuclear periphery has, however, remained unclear. Our recent studies showed that lamins differentially regulate distinct lamina-associated chromatin domains (LADs) at the nuclear periphery, which can in turn influence global 3D genome organization and gene expression. In this Extra View, we discuss how by using various genomics tools, it has become possible to reveal the functions of lamins in orchestrating 3D genome organization and gene expression.

Part. B, Pesticides, food contaminants, and agricultural wastes",2019 05 03,"The purpose of this work was to evaluate the risk-benefit associated with canned sardine consumption, considering the selenium, the mercury and the methylmercury contents and the Se:Hg molar ratio and the Se-health benefit value (HBV) index. In this study, 63 canned sardine samples were purchased worldwide and for the determination of selenium and mercury species, the inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry and thermal decomposition and amalgamation atomic absorption spectrometry were employed. The mean results obtained for the Brazilian samples varied between 12.6 and 65.5 μg kg-1 for Hg; <3.7 and 45.4 μg kg-1 for methylmercury; 310 and 1370 μg kg-1 for Se. The MeHg/Hg ratio showed that the most toxic forms of Hg (MeHg) is predominant in 52 and 39% of the Brazilian samples conserved in tomato sauce and in oil, respectively. Nevertheless, the Se-HBV index and the Hg:Se and Se:Hg molar ratios indicated that the selenium content in canned sardine samples is enough to provide a protective effect on the Hg species.",Metal removal and morphological changes of B. megaterium in the presence of a spent catalyst.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30755080,"Journal of environmental science and health. Part A, Toxic/hazardous substances & environmental engineering",2019 05 13,"Spent catalysts represent an environmental concern, mainly due to their elevated metal content. Although conventional treatment methods for spent catalysts are available, they generate large volumes of potentially harmful wastes and gaseous emissions. To overcome the environmental impact, biotechnological approaches are currently being explored and developed. Thus, the current study assayed the capability of Bacillus megaterium strain MNSH1-9K-1 to remove Al, Ni, V and Ti contained in the spent catalyst coded as ECAT-TL-II. To this end, B. megaterium MNSH1-9K-1 growth and metal uptake abilities in the presence of ECAT-TL-II spent catalyst at 15% (wt/vol) pulp density were evaluated in modified Starkey medium at 37 °C and 200 rpm. The results presented here show B. megaterium resistance capability to the high-metal content residue, and its Al, V and Ni removal ability, in 1,059.15 ± 197.28 mg kg-1 of Al, 43.39 ± 24.13 mg kg-1 of V and 0.58 ± 0.00 mg kg-1 of Ni, corresponding to the 0.79%, 1.63% and 0.46% of each metal content, respectively, while no Ti removal was detected. Besides, it was observed that the sporulation process took place in B. megaterium cells in the presence of the spent catalyst. The results shown in this study suggest the potential of the strain MNSH1-9K-1 for the removal of metals contained in high-metal content residues, contributing also to the knowledge of the metal resistance and removal abilities of B. megaterium in the presence of a spent catalyst, and how morphological cell changes may be occurring while metal removal is taking place.",Loss of friendship following traumatic brain injury: A model grounded in the experience of adults with severe injury.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30755079,Neuropsychological rehabilitation,2019 02 13,"Relationships make important contributions to wellbeing and maintenance of self-worth. For those who sustain traumatic brain injury (TBI), life is frequently characterized by declining interpersonal relationships. The aim of this study was to understand the post-injury experience of friendship from the perspective of adults with severe TBI. Participants were 23 adults who had sustained severe TBI on average 10 years earlier; the majority was between 25 and 45 years old. The experience of friendship was explored using a convergent mixed methods design (quantitative self-report measures and in-depth interviews). Qualitative analysis of interview transcripts employed open and focussed coding to reveal themes and categories. Participants nominated on average 3.35 (SD 2.19) friends. When paid carers and family members were excluded, the mean dropped to 1.52 (SD 1.38). Exploratory correlations between number of friends and quality of life, depression and strong-tie support revealed significant associations of moderate to large effects. The post-injury experience of friendship was broadly conceptualized as ""going downhill"" with four overlapping phases: losing contact, being misunderstood, wanting to share and hanging on. Participants' stories illustrated how rehabilitation can focus on friendship by supporting established relationships and facilitating access to activities that afford interpersonal encounters and opportunities to share experiences.",Comorbid Conditions Explain the Association Between Posttraumatic Stress Disorder and Incident Cardiovascular Disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30755078,Journal of the American Heart Association,2019 03 29,"Background Posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) is associated with risk of cardiovascular disease ( CVD ). Biopsychosocial factors associated with PTSD likely account for some or all of this association. We determined whether 1, or a combination of comorbid conditions explained the association between PTSD and incident CVD . Methods and Results Eligible patients used 1 of 5 Veterans Health Affairs medical centers distributed across the United States. Data were obtained from electronic health records. At index date, 2519 Veterans Health Affairs ( VA ) patients, 30 to 70 years of age, had PTSD diagnoses and 1659 did not. Patients had no CVD diagnoses for 12 months before index date. Patients could enter the cohort between 2008 and 2012 with follow-up until 2015. Age-adjusted Cox proportional hazard models were computed before and after adjusting for comorbidities. Patients were middle aged (mean=50.1 years, SD ±11.0), mostly male (87.0%), and 60% were white. The age-adjusted association between PTSD and incident CVD was significant (hazard ratio=1.41; 95% CI : 1.21-1.63). After adjustment for metabolic conditions, the association between PTSD and incident CVD was attenuated but remained significant (hazard ratio=1.23; 95% CI : 1.06-1.44). After additional adjustment for smoking, sleep disorder, substance use disorder, anxiety disorders, and depression, PTSD was not associated with incident CVD (hazard ratio=0.96; 95% CI : 0.81-1.15). Conclusions PTSD is not an independent risk factor for CVD . Physical and psychiatric conditions and smoking that co-occur with PTSD explain why this patient population has an increased risk of CVD . Careful monitoring may limit exposure to CVD risk factors and subsequent incident CVD .","A multicenter point prevalence survey of antibiotic use in Punjab, Pakistan: findings and implications.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30755077,Expert review of anti-infective therapy,2019 04 09,"In line with the recent global action plan for antimicrobial resistance, this is the first time such a comprehensive antimicrobial point prevalence survey has been undertaken in Pakistan, the sixth most populous country.",Determinants of HIV and Sexually Transmitted Infection Testing and Acquisition Among Female Victims of Intimate Partner Violence.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30755076,Journal of interpersonal violence,2019 06 10,"The purpose of this study was to identify determinants of HIV and sexually transmitted infection (STI) testing and acquisition among female victims of intimate partner violence (IPV). Data were abstracted from intake and HIV/STI testing forms from a family justice center, to identify the socioeconomic and abuse characteristics associated with requesting and obtaining an HIV/STI test ( n = 343) and acquisition of HIV/STIs ( n = 111). Multiple logistic regression using forward selection was used to identify predictors of HIV/STI testing and acquisition. Females experiencing greater risk of lethality were at higher odds of requesting an HIV/STI test; however, risk of lethality did not predict the receipt of an HIV/STI test. A history of sexual assault was associated with higher odds of acquiring HIV/STIs in the past year. Interventions are needed to facilitate HIV/STI testing among female victims of IPV, especially those with higher risk of lethality and a history of sexual assault.",Podocytes and autophagy: a potential therapeutic target in lupus nephritis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30755075,Autophagy,2019 06 10,"Recent studies suggest that defects in macroautophagy/autophagy contribute to the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythamatosus (SLE), especially in adaptive immunity. The occurrence and progression of lupus nephritis (LN) is the end result of complex interactions between regulation of immune responses and pathological process by renal resident cells, but there is still a lot of missing information for establishing the role of autophagy in the pathogenesis of LN, and as a therapy target. In our recent study, we observed that autophagy is activated in LN, especially in podocytes. Based on in vitro assays, many of the most important mediators of the disease - patients' sera, patients' IgG and IFNA/IFN-α - can induce autophagy in both murine and human podocytes, by reactive oxygen species production or MTORC1 inhibition; autophagy activation negatively associates with podocyte injury. With regard to intervention, autophagy activators can protect against podocyte injury, whereas autophagy inhibitors aggravate injury. Taken together, our findings suggest that podocyte autophagy is involved in lupus renal protection and may be a therapeutic target.

Methods and Results We prospectively enrolled 567 subjects without HF (n=364), with HF with reduced ejection fraction (n=111), or with HF with preserved ejection fraction (n=92), who underwent a cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. Skeletal muscle cross-sectional area was assessed with manual tracing of major thoracic muscle groups on axial chest magnetic resonance images. Factor analysis was used to identify a latent factor underlying the shared variability in thoracic muscle cross-sectional area. Cox regression was used to assess the relationship between these measurements and all-cause mortality (median follow up, 36.4 months). A higher overall thoracic muscle area factor assessed with principal component analysis was independently associated with lower mortality (standardized hazard ratio, 0.51; P<0.0001). The thoracic muscle area factor was predictive of death in subjects with HF with preserved ejection fraction, HF with reduced ejection fraction, and those without HF . Among all muscle groups, the pectoralis major cross-sectional area was the most representative of overall muscle area and was also the most robust predictor of death. A higher pectoralis major cross-sectional area predicted a lower mortality (standardized hazard ratio, 0.49; P<0.0001), which persisted after adjustment for various confounders (standardized hazard ratio, 0.55; P=0.0017). Conclusions Axial muscle size, and in particular smaller size of the pectoralis major, is independently associated with higher risk of mortality in patients with and without HF . Further work should clarify the role of muscle wasting as a therapeutic target in patients with HF .",Sustained Captopril-Induced Reduction in Blood Pressure Is Associated With Alterations in Gut-Brain Axis in the Spontaneously Hypertensive Rat.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30755073,Journal of the American Heart Association,2019 03 29,"Background We have demonstrated that the antihypertensive effect of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril ( CAP ), is associated with beneficial effects on gut pathology. Coupled with the evidence that CAP exerts prolonged reduction in blood pressure ( BP ) after discontinuation of treatment, we investigate whether persistent beneficial actions of CAP are linked to alterations of gut microbiota and improvement of hypertension-induced gut pathology. Methods and Results Spontaneously hypertensive rats ( SHR ) and Wistar Kyoto rats were treated with CAP (250 mg/kg/day) for 4 weeks followed by withdrawal for 16 weeks. Gut microbiota, gut pathology, BP, and brain neuronal activity were assessed. CAP resulted in a ≈60 mm Hg decrease in systolic BP after 3 weeks of treatment in SHR , and the decrease remained significant at least 5 weeks after CAP withdrawal. In contrast, CAP caused modest decrease in systolic BP in Wistar Kyoto. 16S rRNA gene-sequencing-based gut microbial analyses in SHR showed sustained alteration of gut microbiota and increase in Allobaculum after CAP withdrawal. Phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states analysis revealed significant increase in bacterial sporulation upon CAP treatment in SHR . These were associated with persistent improvement in gut pathology and permeability. Furthermore, manganese-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging showed significantly decreased neuronal activity in the posterior pituitary of SHR 4 weeks after withdrawal. Conclusions Decreased BP , altered gut microbiota, improved gut pathology and permeability, and dampened posterior pituitary neuronal activity were maintained after CAP withdrawal in the SHR . They suggest that CAP influences the brain-gut axis to maintain the sustained antihypertensive effect of CAP after withdrawal."

We aimed to characterize the relationship between LDL -C and Lp(a) lowering by evolocumab, a PCSK 9 inhibitor, in a large clinical trial population and to determine the prevalence of concordant/discordant LDL -C and Lp(a) responses to PCSK 9 inhibition. Methods and Results Data were analyzed from 4 randomized, 12-week, multicenter, phase 3 evolocumab trials. Patients with familial hypercholesterolemia, nonfamilial hypercholesterolemia, or statin intolerance participated in the trials. The main measure was the degree of concordance or discordance of LDL -C and Lp(a) in response to PCSK 9 inhibition; concordant response was defined as LDL -C reduction >35% and Lp(a) reduction >10%. The study cohort comprised 895 patients (438 female; median age: 59.0 years [interquartile range: 51-66 years]). Baseline mean level of LDL -C was 133.6 mg/dL (SE: 1.7) and median Lp(a) level was 46.4 mg/dL (interquartile range: 18.4-82.4 mg/dL). A discordant response was observed in 165 (19.7%) patients. With these cutoffs, the prevalence of discordance was higher when considering baseline Lp(a) concentrations >30 mg/dL (26.5%) or >50 mg/dL (28.6%). Conclusions We demonstrate high prevalence of discordance in LDL -C and Lp(a) reduction in response to evolocumab, particularly when considering higher baseline Lp(a) concentrations, indicating the possibility of alternative pathways beyond LDLR ( LDL receptor)-mediated clearance involved in Lp(a) reduction by evolocumab.

Intracellular Ca2+ mobilization is a critical modulator of endothelial NO synthase function, and increased cytosolic Ca2+ concentration in endothelial cells is able to induce endothelial NO synthase phosphorylation. Ca2+ release mediated by 3 subtypes of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors ( IP 3Rs) from the endoplasmic reticulum and subsequent Ca2+ entry after endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ store depletion has been proposed to be the major pathway to mobilize Ca2+ in endothelial cells. However, the physiological role of IP 3Rs in regulating blood pressure remains largely unclear. Methods and Results To investigate the role of endothelial IP 3Rs in blood pressure regulation, we first generated an inducible endothelial cell-specific IP 3R1 knockout mouse model and found that deletion of IP 3R1 in adult endothelial cells did not affect vasodilation and blood pressure. Considering all 3 subtypes of IP 3Rs are expressed in mouse endothelial cells, we further generated inducible endothelial cell-specific IP 3R triple knockout mice and found that deletion of all 3 IP 3R subtypes decreased plasma NO concentration and increased basal blood pressure. Furthermore, IP 3R deficiency reduced acetylcholine-induced vasodilation and endothelial NO synthase phosphorylation at Ser1177. Conclusions Our results reveal that IP 3R-mediated Ca2+ release in vascular endothelial cells plays an important role in regulating vasodilation and physiological blood pressure.",Impact of Initial Shunt Type on Echocardiographic Indices in Children After Single Right Ventricle Palliations.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30755054,Circulation. Cardiovascular imaging,2019 06 10,"Background Heart size and function in children with single right ventricle (RV) anomalies may be influenced by shunt type at the Norwood procedure. We sought to identify shunt-related differences during early childhood after staged surgical palliations using echocardiography. Methods We compared echocardiographic indices of RV, neoaortic, and tricuspid valve size and function at 14 months, pre-Fontan, and 6 years in 241 subjects randomized to a Norwood procedure using either the modified Blalock-Taussig shunt or RV-to-pulmonary-artery shunt. Results At 6 years, the shunt groups did not differ significantly in any measure except for increased indexed neoaortic area in the modified Blalock-Taussig shunt. RV ejection fraction improved between pre-Fontan and 6 years in the RV-to-pulmonary artery shunt group but was stable in the modified Blalock-Taussig shunt group. For the entire cohort, RV diastolic and systolic size and functional indices were improved at 6 years compared with earlier measurements, and indexed tricuspid and neoaortic annular area decreased from 14 months to 6 years. The prevalence of ≥moderate tricuspid and neoaortic regurgitation was uncommon and did not vary by group or time period. Diminished RV ejection fraction at the 14-month study was predictive of late death/transplant; the hazard of late death/transplant when RV ejection fraction was <40% was tripled (hazard ratio, 3.18; 95% CI, 1.41-7.17). Conclusions By 6 years after staged palliation, shunt type has not impacted RV size and function, and RV and valvar size and function show beneficial remodeling. Poor RV systolic function at 14 months predicts worse late survival independent of the initial shunt type. Clinical Trial Registration URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov .

Cardiovascular imaging,2019 04 27,"Background The risk of coronary heart disease remains low in Japan, although distributions of several coronary risk factors have become comparable with those in the United States. We prospectively compared coronary atherosclerosis burden, measured with coronary artery calcium (CAC) progression, between men in the 2 countries. Methods In 2 population-based samples of 1712 US White, Black, Hispanic, Chinese men (baseline, 2000-2002) and 697 Japanese men in Japan (2006-2008) aged 45-74 years without clinical cardiovascular disease, we quantified CAC progression by serial computed tomography with medians of 3.4 and 5.2 years between scans, respectively. Results Among White, Black, Hispanic, Chinese, and Japanese men free of baseline CAC, CAC incidence was observed in 35.2%, 26.9%, 29.2%, 18.9%, and 29.2%, respectively. After adjustment for times between scans, demographics, behaviors, coronary risk factors, and their changes between scans, White men had significantly higher CAC incidence than Japanese men (relative risk, 1.68; 95% CI, 1.13-2.50). Among those with detectable baseline CAC, after similar adjustments, all the US race/ethnic groups had significantly greater annual changes in CAC score (mean [95% CI]: 39.4 [35.2-43.6] for White, 26.9 [21.4-32.4] for Black, 30.6 [24.7-36.5] for Hispanic, and 30.2 [22.6-37.8] for Chinese men) than Japanese men (15.9 [10.1-21.8]). Conclusions We found a higher CAC incidence among US White men and greater increases in existing CAC among all the US race/ethnic groups than among Japanese men in Japan. These differences persisted despite adjustment for differences in coronary risk factors.","Nuclear disaster as chronic crisis: Accounts of radiation embodiment by survivors of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster from Belarus born before, in and after 1986.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30755050,"Health (London, England : 1997)",2019 02 13,"This article looks at chronic crisis on an empirical example of radiation embodiment by survivors of a nuclear disaster. Developing further the work of Henrik Vigh, this article argues that chronic crisis is conflictual in nature, where some individuals fully embrace it, while others reject it. A total of 16 in-depth interviews were conducted with survivors of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster from Belarus who were below 18 years in 1986 and born in or after 1986. It is shown that survivors do not consider themselves affected, when they argue against social stigma imposed by others and when development discourse in relation to post-communist health care is used as a background against which nuclear victimhood can be argued. It is also demonstrated that survivors do consider themselves affected, when they embrace disaster temporality and victimhood and argue against narrow scientific definitions of victimhood which downplay a variety of health conditions attributed to the disaster. This article concludes that chronic crisis may not always be transformative, but reproduce the existing inequalities. It contributes to the anthropology of disaster and the anthropology of suffering by bringing together scholarship in feminist theory of disability and critical perspectives on development.",A Pilot Evaluation of Culture Camps to Increase Alaska Native Youth Wellness.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30755049,Health promotion practice,2019 02 13,"Suicide is a significant health disparity among Alaska Native youth, which is linked to cultural disruptions brought about by colonialism and historical trauma. Many Indigenous suicide prevention efforts center on revitalizing and connecting youth to their culture to promote mental health and resilience. A common cultural approach to improve psychosocial outcomes is youth culture camps, but there has been little evaluation research to test this association. Here, we conduct a pilot evaluation of a 5-day culture camp developed in two remote regions of Alaska. The camps bring together Alaska Native youth from villages in these regions to take part in subsistence activities, develop new relationships, develop life skills, and learn traditional knowledge and values. This pilot evaluation of the culture camps uses a quantitative pre/post design to examine the outcomes of self-esteem, emotional states, belongingness, mattering to others, and coping skills among participants. Results indicate that culture camps can significantly increase positive mood, feelings of belongingness, and perceived coping of participants. Culture camps are a common suicide prevention effort in Indigenous circumpolar communities, and although limited in scope and design, this pilot evaluation offers some evidence to support culture camps as a health promotion intervention that can reduce suicide risk.",The empowered patient on a historical-rhetorical model: 19th-century patent-medicine ads and the 21st-century health subject.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30755048,"Health (London, England : 1997)",2019 02 13,"The contemporary health subject, often described as a new, empowered patient, is not simply a character in a story of progress toward knowledge and power, away from credulity and passivity. Before the 20th century, and the assertion of a medical system that became frankly paternalistic, laypeople adjudicated on many matters of illness and its treatments. That is, 18th- and 19th-century health subjects were empowered too, and studying them, especially as consumers of health products, helps us develop a more nuanced account of our current medico-commercial selves. Comparing historical advertisements for ""patent medicines"" and contemporary direct-to-consumer ads for prescription pharmaceuticals, this essay contributes to such an account. It identifies strategies that drug marketers have deployed over centuries to persuade consumers to buy their products, and it tracks a rhetoric of interpellation in advertisements that not only address but also constitute health subjects. The goal of the analysis is to increase alertness to our own susceptibilities to pharmaceutical ads and adjacent rhetorics of health and illness."

Analysis of the ontological principles informing the design and implementation of the Apple Watch and corporate wellness programmes using self-tracking technologies shows that their primary focus is on the capture and control of attention rather than material health outcomes. Health, wellness and happiness have been conflated with productivity, which is now deemed to be dependent on the harnessing of libidinal as well as physical energy. In this context, self-tracking technologies and related corporate wellness interventions have been informed by 'emotional design', neuroscientific and behavioural principles which target the 'pre subjective' consciousness of individuals through manipulating their habits and neurological functioning. This article draws on the work of Bernard Stiegler to suggest framing self-tracking as 'industrial temporal objects', which capture and 'short circuit' attention. It is proposed that a central aim is to 'accumulate the consciousnesses' of subjects consistent with the methods of a contemporary 'attention economy'. This new logic of accumulation informs the behaviour change strategies of designers of self-tracking devices, and corporate wellness initiatives, taking the form of 'psychotechnologies' which attempt to reconstruct active subjects as automatic and reactive 'nodes' as part of managed networks.",The effect of alternate occlusion on control of intermittent exotropia in children.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30755034,European journal of ophthalmology,2019 02 13,The aim is to investigate the effect of alternate occlusion on control of intermittent exotropia in children 3 to 8 years old.,"Dendrodoristerol, a cytotoxic C20 steroid from the Vietnamese nudibranch mollusk Dendrodoris fumata.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30755033,Journal of Asian natural products research,2019 02 13,"Using various chromatographic separations, four steroids including one new C20 steroid namely dendrodoristerol (1), were isolated from the Vietnamese nudibranch mollusk Dendrodoris fumata.

Using dyadic approaches to analyses, we tested whether mothers' and daughters' reports, and their level of agreement, differ by maternal CSV history. In dyads with maternal CSV, daughters reported more frequent communication in which they felt less embarrassed, and they perceived their mothers as less embarrassed. Mothers with a CSV history were also more accurate in judging how their daughters feel during sexual communication. Although CSV is associated with many negative outcomes, our results suggest mothers with CSV may approach mother-daughter sexual communication in ways that could reduce sexual risk in offspring."

Total joint arthoplasty is a commonly used treatment for joint degeneration and osteoarthritis, and due to these factors, TJA for hip and knee joints is projected to grow by 137% and 601% between 2005 and 2030. Matrix metalloproteases are enzymes found in the extracellular matrix that cleave matrix components. Normally MMPs are downregulated in tissues by Tissue Inhibitors of Metalloproteases, or TIMPs. The relative concentration of TIMPs also may denote some of the activity of the MMPs found in serum. Lubricin (proteoglycan 4) is a molecule found in the synovial fluid that protects joints by dissipating strain energy during locomotion. Lubricin synovial fluid concentration is also diminished in many patients with osteoarthritis, but not all. Given the importance of these three sets of molecules, our lab investigated the correlation between circulating lubricin, MMP levels and TIMPs levels. Blood plasma samples were obtained from de-identified subjects undergoing total joint arthroplasty at Loyola University Medical Center and the University of Utah. Normal blood plasma from pooled healthy individuals served as a control. We analyzed biomarker levels in plasma using ELISA. Our data show that MMP-1 and 9 were increased in TJA patients compared to normal controls, while MMP-2 and 13 were decreased. We also found decreased lubricin and tissue factor in surgical patients relative to controls. These data support the idea that lubricin is vital in protecting the synovial joint and that MMPs play a complex role in the destruction of the joint.","Sociodemographic, environmental characteristics and comorbidities of older adults with schizophrenia who access community health service support: A national cross-sectional study.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30754993,The Australian and New Zealand journal of psychiatry,2019 06 07,"Schizophrenia is a serious and chronic mental illness known to have broad ranging impacts for individuals across the lifespan, yet research on the disease in older adults is sparse.

When the 2 D-dimer detections were used in combination with 4 PTP scores for DVT diagnosis, separately, both the positive predictive value and the negative predictive value significantly improved for D-Dimer Plus, and the positive predictive values significantly improved for Innovance D-Dimer. However, the sensitivity, specificity, and negative predictive values did not obviously change. For our patients, Wells score had the best diagnostic efficacy for our patients with suspected DVT among the 4 PTP scores. Innovance D-Dimer in combination with age-adjusted cutoff values exhibited increased sensitivity and negative predictive value for DVT diagnosis and was equivalent to the diagnostic efficacy of the Innovance D-Dimer in combination with PTP scores.",N-terminal of the prohormone brain natriuretic peptide is a predictor of hemodynamic instability in valve disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30754988,Biomarkers in medicine,2019 06 04,"Aim: The usefulness of N-terminal of the prohormone brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) as a predictor of perioperative hemodynamic instability is not fully elucidated. Methods: This prospective study was conducted on a group of 455 patients undergoing elective heart valve surgery. The primary end point at the 30-day follow-up was postoperative hemodynamic instability. The secondary end point was death from all causes in patients with postoperative hemodynamic instability. Results: The postoperative hemodynamic instability occurred in 85 patients. At multivariate analysis NT-proBNP, New York Heart Association classes and glomerular filtration rate remained independent predictors of the primary end point.

To understand the dehydration-driven solvent exposure of hydrophobic surfaces, the micellization of functionalized decyldimethylammonium chlorides, XC10Me2N+Cl-, with a polar functional group, X = C2OH, C2OMe, C2OC2OMe, C2OOEt, together with the ""reference"" compound decyltrimethylammonium chloride, C10Me3N+Cl-, was investigated in aqueous solution by density measurements, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), and dielectric relaxation spectroscopy (DRS). From the density data, the apparent molar volumes of monomers and micelles were estimated, whereas the ITC data were analyzed with the help of a model equation, yielding the thermodynamic parameters and aggregation number. From the DRS spectra, effective hydration numbers of the free monomers and micelles were deduced. The comprehensive analysis of the obtained results shows that the thermodynamics of micellization are strongly affected by the nature of the functional group. Surprisingly, the hydration of micelles formed by surfactant cations with a single alkyl chain on quaternary ammonium is approximately the same, regardless of the alkyl chain length or functionalization of the headgroup. However, notable differences were found for the free monomers where increasing polarity lowers the effective hydration number.",Spatial and Temporal Variability in Attenuation of Polar Organic Micropollutants in an Urban Lowland Stream.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30754970,Environmental science & technology,2019 03 05,"Contamination of rivers by trace organic compounds (TrOCs) poses a risk for aquatic ecosystems and drinking water quality. Spatially- and temporally varying environmental conditions are expected to play a major role in controlling in-stream attenuation of TrOCs. This variability is rarely captured by in situ studies of TrOC attenuation. Instead, snap-shots or time-weighted average conditions and corresponding attenuation rates are reported. The present work sought to investigate this variability and factors controlling it by analysis of 24 TrOCs over a 4.7 km reach of the River Erpe (Berlin, Germany). The factors investigated included sunlight and water temperature as well as the presence of macrophytes. Attenuation rate constants in 48 consecutive hourly water parcels were tracked along two contiguous river sections of different characteristics. Section 1 was less shaded and more densely covered with submerged macrophytes compared to section 2. The sampling campaign was repeated after macrophyte removal from section 1. The findings show, that section 1 generally provided more favorable conditions for both photo- and biodegradation. Macrophyte removal enhanced photolysis of some compounds (e.g., hydrochlorothiazide and diclofenac) while reducing the biodegradation of metoprolol. The transformation products metoprolol acid and valsartan acid were formed along the reach under all conditions.",Resolution of the Ongoing Challenge of Estimating Nonpoint Source Neonicotinoid Pollution in the Yangtze River Basin Using a Modified Mass Balance Approach.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30754969,Environmental science & technology,2019 03 05,"Neonicotinoid insecticides have been widely consumed worldwide, particularly in China. There is a growing interest in the environmental research community about the occurrence, fates, sources, and risks of neonicotinoids. Nine neonicotinoids in river/lake water were measured at 12 sites along the Yangtze River Basin during the dry and wet seasons in 2016, and nonpoint sources were also identified based on a modified mass balance method. A significantly higher concentration of neonicotinoids was found during the dry season probably due to the dilution effect and insecticide consumption. The high pollution levels are due to posing high ecological risks compared with the recommended thresholds. In 2016, 1190 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 822-1690) tons of neonicotinoids were transferred into the adjacent sea. Nonpoint source pollution (1700 (CI = 1200-2370) tons) was the major contributor (91.3%) to the total input of neonicotinoids into the system. Composition profiles identifying specific neonicotinoid sources indicated some changes in usage patterns from old to new types of neonicotinoids. This spatial and seasonal field study and source identification is expected to fill the data gap regarding the limited information on neonicotinoid use patterns and to inform further effective policy-making and intervention programs in China that should be urgently promoted in the near future.","Direct, Real-Time Detection of Adenosine Triphosphate Release from Astrocytes in Three-Dimensional Culture Using an Integrated Electrochemical Aptamer-Based Sensor.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30754968,ACS chemical neuroscience,2019 04 19,"In this manuscript, we describe the development and application of electrochemical aptamer-based (E-AB) sensors directly interfaced with astrocytes in three-dimensional (3D) cell culture to monitor stimulated release of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The aptamer-based sensor couples specific detection of ATP, selective performance directly in cell culture media, and seconds time resolution using squarewave voltammetry for quantitative ATP-release measurements. More specifically, we demonstrate the ability to quantitatively monitor ATP release into the extracellular environment after stimulation by the addition of calcium (Ca2+), ionomycin, and glutamate. The sensor response is confirmed to be specific to ATP and requires the presence of astrocytes in culture. For example, PC12 cells do not elicit a sensor response after stimulation with the same stimulants. In addition, we confirmed cell viability in the collagen matrix for all conditions tested. Our hydrogel-sensor interface offers the potential to study the release of small molecule messengers in 3D environments. Given the generality of electrochemical aptamer-based sensors and the demonstrated successful interfacing of sensors with tissue scaffold material, in the long term, we anticipate our sensors will be able to translate from in vitro to in vivo small molecule recordings.",Cellular immunotherapy in multiple myeloma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30754964,The Korean journal of internal medicine,2019 02 13,"In multiple myeloma (MM), the impaired function of several types of immune cells favors the tumor's escape from immune surveillance and, therefore, its growth and survival.

As majority of CHB patients are going to use oral nucleos(t)ide analogues (NAs) for decades, Safety profile of NAs is of no doubt an important issue. The newest nucleotide analogue tenofovir alafenamide is potent in terms of viral suppression, together with favourable renal and bone safety profile. Biochemical response as reflected by alanine aminotransferase (ALT) normalization is recently found to be prognostically important. Patients who achieved ALT normalization have reduced the risk of hepatic events by 49%. Functional cure as reflected by hepatitis B surface antigen seroclearance not only implies patients may stop NA treatment, it also confers to a reduced risk of hepatocellular carcinoma and other hepatic events. Hence functional cure should be the ultimate treatment goal in CHB patients. Preemptive antiviral treatment may reduce mother-to-child transmission of hepatitis B virus, especially if birth dose of vaccination cannot be given in the first two hours after delivery. Lastly, despite the currently first-line NAs have high-genetic barrier to drug resistance mutations, there are still are many patients who were previously treated with low barrier of resistance including lamivudine, telbivudine or adefovir dipivoxil which could lead to antiviral resistance and affecting the choice of NAs.",Freshwater snails as the intermediate host of trematodes in Iran: a systematic review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30754962,Epidemiology and health,2019 04 17,"Freshwater snails, as the first intermediate hosts of trematodes, can cause health hazards in animals and humans.

In addition, cercarial dermatitis is a job-related disease that is seen often in paddy workers, agricultural labourers, and fishermen in Iran, particularly in Mazandaran Province. Many studies have been conducted in Iran to survey larval trematodes in freshwater snails. However, to the best of our knowledge, no comprehensive data exist regarding infections in gastropods. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to estimate the types and prevalence of cercarial infections in snails in Iran. Electronic English-language and Persian-language databases were searched to identify 24 published articles reporting the prevalence of trematode infections in snails (9 species from 6 families) in various provinces of Iran. In total, 4.4% of gastropods were infected with the larval stages of trematodes. According to the studies reviewed in this meta-analysis' the highest infection prevalence was found in Radix auricularia (9.9%). Twelve larval species of trematodes were identified, and the highest prevalence of cercariae was found for Echinostomatidae cercariae (4.3%). Among the provinces explored, West Azerbaijan had the highest prevalence of infected snails (16.9%). The presence of trematodes in snails could pose a serious health problem in Iran. Thus, further studies are necessary to characterize these infections in other provinces.","A large outbreak of Salmonella enterica serovar Thompson infections associated with chocolate cake in Busan, Korea.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30754961,Epidemiology and health,2019 03 06,This study aimed to reveal the epidemiologic characteristics of the outbreak of gastroenteritis caused by Salmonella enterica serovar Thompson in Busan Metropolitan City and to identify points for improvement to prevent of food-borne disease outbreak.,"Dietary patterns, nutrition, and risk of breast cancer: a case-control study in the west of Iran.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30754960,Epidemiology and health,2019 04 17,Unhealthy dietary patterns are the most important changeable risk factors for breast cancer.

In this review article, we focus on the self-assembly properties of lignin and their contribution to its effective utilization and valorization. Traditionally, investigations on self-assembly properties of lignin have aimed at understanding the lignification process of the cell wall and using it for efficient delignification for commercial purposes. In recent years (mainly the last three years), an increased number of attempts and reports of technical-lignin nanostructure synthesis with controlled particle size and morphology have been published. This has renewed the interests in the self-assembly properties of technical lignins and their possible applications. Based on the sources and processing methods of lignin, there are significant differences between its structure and properties, which is the primary obstacle in the generalized understanding of the lignin structure and the lignification process occurring within cell walls. The reported studies are also specific to source and processing methods. This work has been divided into two parts. In the first part, the aggregation propensity of lignin based on type, source and extraction method, temperature, and pH of solution is discussed. This is followed by a critical overview of non-covalent interactions and their contribution to the self-associative properties of lignin. The role of self-assembly towards the understanding of xylogenesis and nanoparticle synthesis is also discussed. A particular emphasis is placed on the interaction and forces involved that are used to explain the self-association of lignin.",Alterations in Platelet Alpha-Granule Secretion and Adhesion on Collagen under Flow in Mice Lacking the Atypical Rho GTPase RhoBTB3.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30754723,Cells,2019 03 29,"Typical Rho GTPases, such as Rac1, Cdc42, and RhoA, act as molecular switches regulating various aspects of platelet cytoskeleton reorganization. The loss of these enzymes results in reduced platelet functionality. Atypical Rho GTPases of the RhoBTB subfamily are characterized by divergent domain architecture. One family member, RhoBTB3, is expressed in platelets, but its function is unclear. In the present study we examined the role of RhoBTB3 in platelet function using a knockout mouse model. We found the platelet count, size, numbers of both alpha and dense granules, and surface receptor profile in these mice were comparable to wild-type mice. Deletion of Rhobtb3 had no effect on aggregation and dense granule secretion in response to a range of agonists including thrombin, collagen, and adenosine diphosphate (ADP). By contrast, alpha-granule secretion increased in mice lacking RhoBTB3 in response to thrombin, collagen related peptide (CRP) and U46619/ADP. Integrin activation and spreading on fibrinogen and collagen under static conditions were also unimpaired; however, we observed reduced platelet accrual on collagen under flow conditions. These defects did not translate into alterations in tail bleeding time. We conclude that genetic deletion of Rhobtb3 leads to subtle alterations in alpha-granule secretion and adhesion to collagen without significant effects on hemostasis in vivo.",Micro-Structured Polydopamine Films via Pulsed Electrochemical Deposition.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30754722,"Nanomaterials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 03 12,"Polydopamine (PDA) films are interesting as smart functional materials, and their controlled structured formation plays a significant role in a wide range of applications ranging from cell adhesion to sensing and catalysis.

Thereby, precise and reproducible film thicknesses of the deposited spots could be achieved ranging from 5.9 +/- 0.48 nm (1 pulse cycle) to 75.4 nm +/- 2.5 nm for 90 pulse cycles. The obtained morphology is different in comparison to films deposited via cyclic voltammetry or films formed by autooxidation showing a cracked blister-like structure for high pulse cycle numbers.

Ab initio protein structure prediction is based on amino acid sequence alone, thus, it has a wide application area. With the ab initio method, a large number of candidate protein structures called decoy set can be predicted, however, it is a difficult problem to select a good near-native structure from the predicted decoy set. In this work we propose a new method for selecting the near-native structure from the decoy set based on both contact map overlap (CMO) and graphlets. By generalizing graphlets to ordered graphs, and using a dynamic programming to select the optimal alignment with an introduced gap penalty, a GR_score is defined for calculating the similarity between the three-dimensional (3D) decoy structures. The proposed method was applied to all 54 single-domain targets in CASP11 and all 43 targets in CASP10, and ensemble clustering was used to cluster the protein decoy structures based on the computed CR_scores. The most popular centroid structure was selected as the near-native structure. The experiments showed that compared to the SPICKER method, which is used in I-TASSER, the proposed method can usually select better near-native structures in terms of the similarity between the selected structure and the true native structure.",Dose-Dependent Toxic Effect of Cotinine-Verified Tobacco Smoking on Systemic Inflammation in Apparently Healthy Men and Women: A Nationwide Population-Based Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30754720,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 04 16,"Chronic exposure to tobacco smoke leads to chronic low-grade systemic inflammation; however, little is known about the dose-dependent toxic effect of objective tobacco smoking on systemic inflammation. We examined the dose-dependent toxic effect of cotinine-verified tobacco smoking on leukocyte count in a representative sample of Korean adults, including 8655 men and 10,432 women aged 19⁻65 years from the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. The participants were categorized into five groups by the level of urine cotinine (Ucot) as follows: A non-smoker group (<50.00 ng/mL) and four quartile groups for smokers for both men and women. The odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for sex-specific high leukocyte count (≥75th percentile) were calculated across five groups of Ucot concentrations using multiple logistic regression analyses. The mean values of leukocyte count gradually increased according to the grade of Ucot concentration in both sexes. The ORs (95% CIs) for high leukocyte count in the 4th Ucot quartile concentrations versus the non-smokers were 4.09 (3.39⁻4.94) for men and 3.91 (2.82⁻5.41) for women after adjusting for confounding variables.

ORAI1 is a protein that forms a calcium-permeable ion channel responsible for store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) in a variety of cell types. ORAI3, a related isoform, is not a regulator of SOCE in most cell types. However, ORAI3 does control SOCE in many estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer cell lines, where it also controls proliferation. ORAI1 is a well-characterized regulator of the proliferation and migration of many basal breast cancer cells; however, the role of ORAI3 in these types of breast cancer cells remains unclear. Here, we sought to define ORAI1 and ORAI3 expression in breast cancer cell lines of different molecular subtypes and assess the potential role and regulation of ORAI3 in basal breast cancer cells. Our study demonstrates that elevated ORAI1 is a feature of basal-like breast cancers, while elevated ORAI3 is a feature of luminal breast cancers. Intriguingly, we found that ORAI3 is over-expressed in the mesenchymal subtype of triple-negative breast cancer. Given this, we assessed ORAI3 levels in the presence of two inducers of the mesenchymal phenotype, hypoxia and epidermal growth factor (EGF). Hypoxia induced ORAI3 levels in basal breast cancer cell lines through a pathway involving hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF1α. The silencing of ORAI3 attenuated hypoxia-associated phosphorylation of the EGF receptor (EGFR) and the expression of genes associated with cell migration and inflammatory/immune responses in the MDA-MB-468 model of basal breast cancer. Although elevated ORAI3 levels were not associated with survival; basal, estrogen receptor-negative and triple-negative breast cancers with high ORAI3 and low ORAI1 levels were associated with poorer clinical outcomes. This study defines ORAI3 as a potential fine-tuner for processes relevant to the progression of basal breast cancers."

As the main mycotoxin with high toxicity, wheat, barley, corn and their products are susceptible to contamination of DON. Due to the stability of this mycotoxin, traditional methods for DON reduction often require a strong oxidant, high temperature and high pressure with more energy consumption. Therefore, exploring green, efficient and environmentally friendly ways to degrade or reduce DON is a meaningful and challenging issue. Herein, a dendritic-like α-Fe₂O₃ was successfully prepared using a facile hydrothermal synthesis method at 160 °C, which was systematically characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). It was found that dendritic-like α-Fe₂O₃ showed superior activity for the photocatalytic degradation of DON in aqueous solution under visible light irradiation (λ > 420 nm) and 90.3% DON (initial concentration of 4.0 μg/mL) could be reduced in 2 h. Most of all, the main possible intermediate products were proposed through high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS) after the photocatalytic treatment. This work not only provides a green and promising way to mitigate mycotoxin contamination but also may present useful information for future studies.","Trastuzumab Induced Chemobrain, Atorvastatin Rescued Chemobrain with Enhanced Anticancer Effect and without Hair Loss-Side Effect.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30754707,Journal of clinical medicine,2019 03 29,"The authors identified that chemo-brain was induced after trastuzumab (TZB) therapy. In addition, atorvastatin (ATV) could rescue chemo-brain during trastuzumab (TZB) therapy. Enhanced therapeutic effect of TZB was confirmed after ATV therapy. We also investigated that there was no hair loss side effect due to ATV therapy. In an animal model, 150 μg TZB and five serial doses of 20 mg/kg ATV were administered. 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data were acquired. Statistical parametric mapping analysis and voxel-based morphometry analysis were performed to identify differences in glucose metabolism and gray matter concentration. The enhanced therapeutic efficacy of TZB after ATV treatment was assessed using a human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive gastric cancer model. We found a decrease in cerebral glucose metabolism and gray matter concentration in the frontal lobe following TZB therapy (p < 0.005). After subsequent ATV administration, glucose metabolism and regional gray matter concentration were rescued (p < 0.005). Cognitive impairment due to TZB and the rescue effect of ATV were confirmed using a passive avoidance test and quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR. Furthermore, the penetration and accumulation of TZB in tumors increased by 100% after ATV co-administration, which resulted in an enhanced anti-cancer effect. Our study collectively demonstrates that ATV co-administration with TZB rescued the TZB-induced chemo-brain and enhances the therapeutic efficacy of TZB in tumors. We also showed that there was no hair loss during ATV therapy.",Gli Proteins: Regulation in Development and Cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30754706,Cells,2019 03 29,"Gli proteins are transcriptional effectors of the Hedgehog signaling pathway. They play key roles in the development of many organs and tissues, and are deregulated in birth defects and cancer. We review the molecular mechanisms of Gli protein regulation in mammals, with special emphasis on posttranslational modifications and intracellular transport. We also discuss how Gli proteins interact with co-activators and co-repressors to fine-tune the expression of Hedgehog target genes. Finally, we provide an overview of the regulation of developmental processes and tissue regeneration by Gli proteins and discuss how these proteins are involved in cancer progression, both through canonical regulation via the Hedgehog pathway and through cross-talk with other signaling pathways.",Evaluation of Physicians' Knowledge and Attitudes Towards Biosimilars in Russia and Issues Associated with Their Prescribing.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30754705,Biomolecules,2019 04 10,"Physician awareness and perceptions towards biosimilars are important factors in their adoption to clinical practice. Our objectives were to assess levels of knowledge and attitudes towards biosimilars and key policies on their use among Russian physicians, define the level of interest in new information on biosimilars, and determine what evidence drives treatment decisions in Russia. Physicians with awareness of biologics across different specialties and regions of Russia completed an online survey. A Likert and other rating scales were used to collect opinions, which were summarized descriptively. Responses of subgroups of respondents were compared using t-tests. Among 206 respondents (n = 51 rheumatologists; n = 53 gastroenterologists; n = 50 hematologists; n = 52 oncologists), 66% had positive impressions regarding the introduction of biosimilars in Russia. Overall, 80% lacked understanding of the differences between biosimilars and generics. In all, 67% supported prescribing biologics by distinguishable names and were negative about tender policies limiting choice of therapies for patients. The majority believed in mandatory publication of clinical trial results on biosimilars (94%), agreed biosimilars should be subject to rigorous post-marketing surveillance (98%), and expressed willingness to learn more about biosimilars (94%). Biosimilar education among Russian physicians is required, which may help shape balanced and evidence-based policies for biosimilars in Russia.",Microfluidic High-Migratory Cell Collector Suppressing Artifacts Caused by Microstructures.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30754704,Micromachines,2019 04 10,"The small number of high-migratory cancer cells in a cell population make studies on high-migratory cancer cells difficult. For the development of migration assays for such cancer cells, several microfluidic devices have been developed. However, they measure migration that is influenced by microstructures and they collect not only high-migratory cells, but also surrounding cells. In order to find high-migratory cells in cell populations while suppressing artifacts and to collect these cells while minimizing damages, we developed a microfluidic high-migratory cell collector with the ability to sort cancer cells according to cellular migration and mechanical detachment. High-migratory cancer cells travel further from the starting line when all of the cells are seeded on the same starting line. The high-migratory cells are detached using a stretch of cell adhesive surface using a water-driven balloon actuator. Using this cell collector, we selected high-migratory HeLa cells that migrated about 100m in 12 h and collected the cells.",Identification of Prognostic and Predictive Osteosarcoma Biomarkers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30754703,"Medical sciences (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 03 29,"Both adolescents and children suffer from osteosarcoma, localized in the metaphysis of the long bones. This is the most common primary high-grade bone tumor in this patient group. Early tumor detection is the key to ensuring effective treatment. Improved osteosarcoma outcomes in clinical trials have been contingent on biomarker discovery and an evolving understanding of molecules and their complex interactions. In this review, we present a short overview of biomarkers for osteosarcoma, and highlight advances in osteosarcoma-related biomarker research. Many studies show that several biomarkers undergo critical changes with osteosarcoma progression. Growing knowledge about osteosarcoma-related markers is expected to positively impact the development of therapeutics for osteosarcoma, and ultimately of clinical care. It has also become important to develop new biomarkers, which can identify vulnerable patients who should be treated with more intensive and aggressive therapy after diagnosis.",Artificial Neural Network Prediction of Retention of Amino Acids in Reversed-Phase HPLC under Application of Linear Organic Modifier Gradients and/or pH Gradients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30754702,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 02 24,"A multi-layer artificial neural network (ANN) was used to model the retention behavior of 16 o-phthalaldehyde derivatives of amino acids in reversed-phase liquid chromatography under application of various gradient elution modes. The retention data, taken from literature, were collected in acetonitrile⁻water eluents under application of linear organic modifier gradients ( gradients), pH gradients, or double pH/ gradients. At first, retention data collected in  gradients and pH gradients were modeled separately, while these were successively combined in one dataset and fitted simultaneously. Specific ANN-based models were generated by combining the descriptors of the gradient profiles with 16 inputs representing the amino acids and providing the retention time of these solutes as the response. Categorical ""bit-string"" descriptors were adopted to identify the solutes, which allowed simultaneously modeling the retention times of all 16 target amino acids. The ANN-based models tested on external gradients provided mean errors for the predicted retention times of 1.1% ( gradients), 1.4% (pH gradients), 2.5% (combined  and pH gradients), and 2.5% (double pH/ gradients). The accuracy of ANN prediction was better than that previously obtained by fitting of the same data with retention models based on the solution of the fundamental equation of gradient elution.","Exploring the Diversity and Novelty of Toxin Genes in Naja sumatrana, the Equatorial Spitting Cobra from Malaysia through De Novo Venom-Gland Transcriptomics.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30754700,Toxins,2019 04 02,"The equatorial spitting cobra, Naja sumatrana, is a distinct species of medically important venomous snakes, listed as WHO Category 1 in Southeast Asia. The diversity of its venom genes has not been comprehensively examined, although a few toxin sequences annotated to Naja sputatrix were reported previously through cloning studies. To investigate this species venom genes' diversity, de novo venom-gland transcriptomics of N. sumatrana from West Malaysia was conducted using next-generation sequencing technology. Genes encoding toxins represented only 60 of the 55,396 transcripts, but were highly expressed, contributing to 79.22% of total gene expression (by total FPKM) in the venom-glands. The toxin transcripts belong to 21 families, and 29 transcripts were further identified as full-length. Three-finger toxins (3FTx) composed of long, short, and non-conventional groups, constituted the majority of toxin transcripts (91.11% of total toxin FPKM), followed by phospholipase A₂ (PLA₂, 7.42%)-which are putatively pro-inflammatory and cytotoxic. The remaining transcripts in the 19 families were expressed at extremely low levels. Presumably, these toxins were associated with ancillary functions. Our findings unveil the diverse toxin genes unique to N. sumatrana, and provide insights into the pathophysiology of N. sumatrana envenoming.",Using Morphogenic Genes to Improve Recovery and Regeneration of Transgenic Plants.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30754699,"Plants (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 03 29,"Efficient transformation of numerous important crops remains a challenge, due predominantly to our inability to stimulate growth of transgenic cells capable of producing plants. For years, this difficulty has been partially addressed by tissue culture strategies that improve regeneration either through somatic embryogenesis or meristem formation. Identification of genes involved in these developmental processes, designated here as morphogenic genes, provides useful tools in transformation research. In species from eudicots and cereals to gymnosperms, ectopic overexpression of genes involved in either embryo or meristem development has been used to stimulate growth of transgenic plants. However, many of these genes produce pleiotropic deleterious phenotypes. To mitigate this, research has been focusing on ways to take advantage of growth-stimulating morphogenic genes while later restricting or eliminating their expression in the plant. Methods of controlling ectopic overexpression include the use of transient expression, inducible promoters, tissue-specific promoters, and excision of the morphogenic genes. These methods of controlling morphogenic gene expression have been demonstrated in a variety of important crops. Here, we provide a review that highlights how ectopic overexpression of genes involved in morphogenesis has been used to improve transformation efficiencies, which is facilitating transformation of numerous recalcitrant crops. The use of morphogenic genes may help to alleviate one of the bottlenecks currently slowing progress in plant genome modification.",Graphene Oxide Decorated Nanometal-Poly(Anilino-Dodecylbenzene Sulfonic Acid) for Application in High Performance Supercapacitors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30754698,Micromachines,2019 04 10,"Graphene oxide (GO) decorated with silver (Ag), copper (Cu) or platinum (Pt) nanoparticles that are anchored on dodecylbenzene sulfonic acid (DBSA)-doped polyaniline (PANI) were prepared by a simple one-step method and applied as novel materials for high performance supercapacitors. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and high-resolution scanning electron microscopy (HRSEM) analyses revealed that a metal-decorated polymer matrix is embedded within the GO sheet. This caused the M/DBSA⁻PANI (M = Ag, Cu or Pt) particles to adsorb on the surface of the GO sheets, appearing as aggregated dark regions in the HRSEM images. The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy studies revealed that GO was successfully produced and decorated with Ag, Cu or Pt nanoparticles anchored on DBSA⁻PANI. This was confirmed by the appearance of the GO signature epoxy C⁻O vibration band at 1040 cm-1 (which decreased upon the introduction of metal nanoparticle) and the PANI characteristic N⁻H stretching vibration band at 3144 cm-1 present only in the GO/M/DBSA⁻PANI systems. The composites were tested for their suitability as supercapacitor materials; and specific capacitance values of 206.4, 192.8 and 227.2 F·g-1 were determined for GO/Ag/DBSA⁻PANI, GO/Cu/DBSA⁻PANI and GO/Pt/DBSA⁻PANI, respectively. The GO/Pt/DBSA⁻PANI electrode exhibited the best specific capacitance value of the three electrodes and also had twice the specific capacitance value reported for Graphene/MnO₂//ACN (113.5 F·g-1). This makes GO/Pt/DBSA⁻PANI a very promising organic supercapacitor material."

The effects of HPH treatment on the physicochemical properties of the starch system were investigated. The properties were affected by HPH to various extents, depending on the pressure. These influences can be explained by the destruction of the crystalline and amorphous regions of pressurized LS. The short-range order of LS was reduced by HPH and starch structure C-type was transformed into B-type, exhibiting lower transition temperatures and enthalpy. The LS absorbed a great deal of water under HPH and rapidly swelled, resulting in increased swelling power, solubility and size distribution. It then showed ""broken porcelain-like"" morphology with reduced pasting properties. Digestion of pressurized LS complex investigated by a dynamic in vitro rat stomach⁻duodenum model showed higher digestion efficiency and the residues exhibited gradual damage in morphology.",A High-Computational Efficiency Human Detection and Flow Estimation Method Based on TOF Measurements.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30754685,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 02 27,"State-of-the-art human detection methods focus on deep network architectures to achieve higher recognition performance, at the expense of huge computation.

The proposed algorithm mainly consists of head detection based on local pooling and searching, classification refinement based on human morphological features, and tracking assignment filter based on dynamic multi-dimensional feature. A depth image dataset record with more than 10k entries and departure events with detailed human location annotations is established. Taking full advantage of the distance information implied in the depth image, we achieve high-accuracy human detection and people counting with accuracy of 97.73% and significantly reduce the running time. Experiments demonstrate that our algorithm can run at 23.10 ms per frame on a CPU platform.

Although the conventional treatment has demonstrated a certain effect, some limitations still exist. The Rho guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) Cdc42 (Cell division control protein 42 homolog) is often upregulated by some cell surface receptors and oncogenes in breast cancer. Cdc42 switches from inactive guanosine diphosphate (GDP)-bound to active GTP-bound though guanine-nucleotide-exchange factors (GEFs), results in activation of signaling cascades that regulate various cellular processes such as cytoskeletal changes, proliferation and polarity establishment. Targeting Cdc42 also provides a strategy for precise breast cancer therapy. In addition, Cdc42 is a potential target for several types of non-coding RNAs including microRNAs and lncRNAs. These non-coding RNAs is extensively involved in Cdc42-induced tumor processes, while many of them are aberrantly expressed. Here, we focus on the role of Cdc42 in cell morphogenesis, proliferation, motility, angiogenesis and survival, introduce the Cdc42-targeted non-coding RNAs, as well as present current development of effective Cdc42-targeted inhibitors in breast cancer.",Prevalence of Dietary Behavior and Determinants of Quality of Diet among Beneficiaries of Government Welfare Assistance in Poland.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30754683,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 04 16,"Diet, as a modifiable factor for good health maintenance, reduces the risk of numerous non-communicable chronic diseases and prevents premature death.

Lifestyle modifications, such as exercise and caloric restriction, have proven effective against obesity in the short term, yet obesity persists because of the high predilection for weight regain. Therefore, alternative approaches to achieve long term sustainable weight loss are urgently needed. Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), a fatty acid found naturally in ruminant animal food products, has been identified as a potential anti-obesogenic agent, with substantial efficacy in mice, and modest efficacy in obese human populations. Originally described as an anti-carcinogenic fatty acid, in addition to its anti-obesogenic effects, CLA has now been shown to possess anti-atherosclerotic properties. This review summarizes the pre-clinical and human studies conducted using CLA to date, which collectively suggest that CLA has efficacy against cancer, obesity, and atherosclerosis. In addition, the potential mechanisms for the many integrative physiological effects of CLA supplementation will be discussed in detail, including an introduction to the gut microbiota as a potential mediator of CLA effects on obesity and atherosclerosis.",In Silico Study Probes Potential Inhibitors of Human Dihydrofolate Reductase for Cancer Therapeutics.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30754680,Journal of clinical medicine,2019 03 29,"Dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) is an essential cellular enzyme and thereby catalyzes thereduction of dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate (THF).

In the current study, ligand-based pharmacophore modeling identified and evaluatedthe critical chemical features of hDHFR inhibitors. A pharmacophore model (Hypo1) was generatedfrom known inhibitors of DHFR with a correlation coefficient (0.94), root mean square (RMS)deviation (0.99), and total cost value (125.28). Hypo1 was comprised of four chemical features,including two hydrogen bond donors (HDB), one hydrogen bond acceptor (HBA), and onehydrophobic (HYP). Hypo1 was validated using Fischer's randomization, test set, and decoy setvalidations, employed as a 3D query in a virtual screening at Maybridge, Chembridge, Asinex,National Cancer Institute (NCI), and Zinc databases.

DOX-loaded HES conjugates with redox-sensitivity (HES-SS-DOX) were first synthesized and they were then combined with ICG to self-assemble into HES-SS-DOX@ICG NPs with controlled compositions and sizes via collaborative interactions. The optimal HES-SS-DOX@ICG NPs had good physical and photothermal stability in aqueous media and showed high photothermal efficiency in vivo. They were able to fast release the loaded DOX in response to the redox stimulus and the applied laser irradiation. Based on the H22-tumor-bearing mouse model, these NPs were found to tendentiously accumulate inside tumors in comparison to other major organs. The HES-SS-DOX@ICG NPs together with dose-designated laser irradiation were able to fully eradicate tumors with only one injection and one single subsequent laser irradiation on the tumor site during a 14-day treatment period. In addition, they showed almost no impairment to the body. The presently developed HES-SS-DOX@ICG NPs have good in vivo safety and highly efficient anti-tumor capability.

Therefore, there is high importance to analyze and forecast on reducing China's CO2 emissions from lime industrial process. The aims of this paper are to make up the research gaps in China and provide a quantitative reference for related authorities to formulate relevant policies. The prediction method in this paper is consistent with the published national inventory, which is an activity data based method to predict carbon dioxide emissions from the industrial process of four categories of lime products. Three future scenarios are assumed. The business as usual scenario (BAU) is a frozen scenario. There are two emission reduction scenarios (ERS and SRS) assumed under different emission reduction strength considering combined industrial process CO₂ emission reduction approaches from both the production side and the consumption side. The results show that between 2020 and 2050, China's lime industrial process has an increasingly significant CO₂ emission reduction potential, enabling both emission intensity reductions and total emission reductions to be achieved simultaneously. Based on the simulation results from emission reduction scenarios, compared with 2012 level, in 2050, the emission intensity can be reduced by 13⁻27%, the total lime production can be reduced by 49⁻78%, and the CO₂ emissions in the lime industrial process can be reduced by 57⁻85%."

To protect the Internet from such threats and improve security mechanisms, it is critical to understand the botnets' intents and characterize their behavior. Current malware analysis solutions, when faced with IoT, present limitations in regard to the network access containment and network traffic manipulation. In this paper, we present an approach for handling the network traffic generated by the IoT malware in an analysis environment. The proposed solution can modify the traffic at the network layer based on the actions performed by the malware. In our study case, we investigated the Mirai and Bashlite botnet families, where it was possible to block attacks to other systems, identify attacks targets, and rewrite botnets commands sent by the botnet controller to the infected devices.",Stereoselective Multicomponent Reactions in the Synthesis or Transformations of Epoxides and Aziridines.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30754666,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 02 24,"Small ring heterocycles, such as epoxides and aziridines, are present in several natural products and are also highly versatile building blocks, frequently involved in the synthesis of numerous bioactive products and pharmaceuticals.

The current therapy consists of a combination of antibiotics over the course of four months. Current treatment protocols run into problems due to the growing antibiotic resistance of Mtb and poor compliance to the multi-drug-resistant TB treatment protocol. New treatments are being investigated that target host intracellular processes that could be effective in fighting Mtb infections. Autophagy is an intracellular process that is involved in eliminating cellular debris, as well as intracellular pathogens. Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is an enzyme involved in inhibiting this pathway. Modulation of mTOR and the autophagy cellular machinery are being investigated as potential therapeutic targets for novel Mtb treatments. In this review, we discuss the background of Mtb pathogenesis, including its interaction with the innate and adaptive immune systems, the mTOR and autophagy pathways, the interaction of Mtb with these pathways, and finally, the drug everolimus, which targets these pathways and is a potential novel therapy for TB treatment.",Spatiotemporal Prediction of Increasing Winter Perceived Temperature across a Sub-Tropical City for Sustainable Planning and Climate Change Mitigation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30754664,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 04 16,"Climate variability has been documented as being key to influencing human wellbeing across cities as it is linked to mortality and illness due to changes in the perceived weather cycle. Many studies have investigated the impact of summer temperature on human health and have proposed mitigation strategies for summer heat waves. However, sub-tropical cities are still experiencing winter temperature variations. Increasing winter perceived temperature through the decades may soon affect city wellbeing, due to a larger temperature change between normal winter days and extreme cold events, which may cause higher health risk due to lack of adaptation and self-preparedness. Therefore, winter perceived temperature should also be considered and integrated in urban sustainable planning. This study has integrated the increasing winter perceived temperature as a factor for developing spatiotemporal protocols for mitigating the adverse impact of climate change. Land surface temperature (LST) derived from satellite images and building data extracted from aerial photographs were used to simulate the adjusted wind chill equivalent temperature (AWCET) particularly for sub-tropical scenarios between 1990 and 2010 of the Kowloon Peninsula, Hong Kong. Compared with perceived temperature based on the representative station located at the headquarters of the Hong Kong Observatory, the temperature of half the study area in the Kowloon Peninsula has raised by 1.5 °C. The areas with less green space and less public open space in 2010 show higher relative temperatures. Socioeconomically deprived areas (e.g., areas with lower median monthly income) may suffer more from this scenario, but not all types of socioeconomic disparities are associated with poor sustainable planning. Based on our results and the ""no-one left behind"" guideline from the United Nations, climate change mitigation should be conducted by targeting socioeconomic neighborhoods more than just aging communities.",Is Retinal Metabolic Dysfunction at the Center of the Pathogenesis of Age-related Macular Degeneration?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30754662,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 05 29,"The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) forms the outer blood⁻retina barrier and facilitates the transepithelial transport of glucose into the outer retina via GLUT1. Glucose is metabolized in photoreceptors via the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) but also by aerobic glycolysis to generate glycerol for the synthesis of phospholipids for the renewal of their outer segments. Aerobic glycolysis in the photoreceptors also leads to a high rate of production of lactate which is transported out of the subretinal space to the choroidal circulation by the RPE. Lactate taken up by the RPE is converted to pyruvate and metabolized via OXPHOS. Excess lactate in the RPE is transported across the basolateral membrane to the choroid. The uptake of glucose by cone photoreceptor cells is enhanced by rod-derived cone viability factor (RdCVF) secreted by rods and by insulin signaling. Together, the three cells act as symbiotes: the RPE supplies the glucose from the choroidal circulation to the photoreceptors, the rods help the cones, and both produce lactate to feed the RPE. In age-related macular degeneration this delicate ménage à trois is disturbed by the chronic infiltration of inflammatory macrophages. These immune cells also rely on aerobic glycolysis and compete for glucose and produce lactate. We here review the glucose metabolism in the homeostasis of the outer retina and in macrophages and hypothesize what happens when the metabolism of photoreceptors and the RPE is disturbed by chronic inflammation.",Stratification of Breast Cancer by Integrating Gene Expression Data and Clinical Variables.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30754661,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 02 24,"Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease. Although gene expression profiling has led to the definition of several subtypes of breast cancer, the precise discovery of the subtypes remains a challenge. Clinical data is another promising source. In this study, clinical variables are utilized and integrated to gene expressions for the stratification of breast cancer. We adopt two phases: gene selection and clustering, where the integration is in the gene selection phase; only genes whose expressions are most relevant to each clinical variable and least redundant among themselves are selected for further clustering. In practice, we simply utilize maximum relevance minimum redundancy (mRMR) for gene selection and k-means for clustering. We compare the results of our method with those of two commonly used only expression-based breast cancer stratification methods: prediction analysis of microarray 50 (PAM50) and highest variability (HV). The result is that our method outperforms them in identifying subtypes significantly associated with five-year survival and recurrence time. Specifically, our method identified recurrence-associated breast cancer subtypes that were not identified by PAM50 and HV. Additionally, our analysis discovered three survival-associated luminal-A subgroups and two survival-associated luminal-B subgroups. The study indicates that screening clinically relevant gene expressions yields improved breast cancer stratification.",Nevoid Basal Cell Carcinoma Syndrome: PTCH1 Mutation Profile and Expression of Genes Involved in the Hedgehog Pathway in Argentinian Patients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30754660,Cells,2019 03 29,"Nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome (NBCCS) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by multiple basal cell carcinomas (BCC), mainly caused by PTCH1 gene mutations. Our current study aimed to establish (1) PTCH1 germinal and somatic mutational status, (2) component and Hedgehog (HH) pathway targets gene expression patterns, and (3) profile variations according to the genetic background in BCC and normal surrounding skin (NSS). We collected 23 blood and 20 BCC patient samples and analyzed the PTCH1 gene using bidirectional sequencing and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification. Quantitative PCR was used to determine the mRNA expression levels of PTCH1, SMO, GLI3, and CCND1 in paired samples of BCC and NSS from 20 patients and four non-NBCCS skin controls (C). Our analyses identified 12 germline and five somatic sequence variants in PTCH1. mRNA levels of PTCH1, SMO, and GLI3 were higher in NSS compared to C samples, reaching maximum values in BCC samples (p < 0.05). NSS with PTCH1 germline mutations had modified SMO,PTCH1, and GLI3 mRNA levels compared to samples without mutation (p < 0.01). Two PTCH1 mutations in BCC led to an increase in PTCH1, SMO, and GLI3, and a decrease in CCND1 mRNA levels (p < 0.01 vs. BCC with germline mutation only). These results indicate that besides PTCH1, other genes are responsible for NBCCS and BCC development in a population exposed to high UV radiation. Additionally, the mutational events caused increased expression of HH-related genes, even in phenotypically normal skin.",Stochastic Constitutive Model of Isotropic Thin Fiber Networks Based on Stochastic Volume Elements.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30754659,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 02 24,"Thin fiber networks are widely represented in nature and can be found in man-made materials such as paper and packaging. The strength of such materials is an intricate subject due to inherited randomness and size-dependencies. Direct fiber-level numerical simulations can provide insights into the role of the constitutive components of such networks, their morphology, and arrangements on the strength of the products made of them. However, direct mechanical simulation of randomly generated large and thin fiber networks is characterized by overwhelming computational costs. Herein, a stochastic constitutive model for predicting the random mechanical response of isotropic thin fiber networks of arbitrary size is presented. The model is based on stochastic volume elements (SVEs) with SVE size-specific deterministic and stochastic constitutive law parameters. The randomness in the network is described by the spatial fields of the uniaxial strain and strength to failure, formulated using multivariate kernel functions and approximate univariate probability density functions. The proposed stochastic continuum approach shows good agreement when compared to direct numerical simulation with respect to mechanical response. Furthermore, strain localization patterns matched the one observed in direct simulations, which suggests an accurate prediction of the failure location. This work demonstrates that the proposed stochastic constitutive model can be used to predict the response of random isotropic fiber networks of arbitrary size.",Enhanced Hydrogen Detection in ppb-Level by Electrospun SnO₂-Loaded ZnO Nanofibers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30754658,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 02 27,"High-performance hydrogen sensors are important in many industries to effectively address safety concerns related to the production, delivering, storage and use of H₂ gas.

Microscopic analyses demonstrated the formation of NFs with expected morphology and chemical composition. Hydrogen sensing studies were performed at various temperatures and the optimal working temperature was selected as 300 °C. The optimal gas sensor (0.1 SnO₂ loaded ZnO NFs) not only showed a high response to 50 ppb hydrogen gas, but also showed an excellent selectivity to hydrogen gas. The excellent performance of the gas sensor to hydrogen gas was mainly related to the formation of SnO₂-ZnO heterojunctions and the metallization effect of ZnO.",Insulin and Insulin Receptors in Adipose Tissue Development.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30754657,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 05 29,"Insulin is a major endocrine hormone also involved in the regulation of energy and lipid metabolism via the activation of an intracellular signaling cascade involving the insulin receptor (INSR), insulin receptor substrate (IRS) proteins, phosphoinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and protein kinase B (AKT). Specifically, insulin regulates several aspects of the development and function of adipose tissue and stimulates the differentiation program of adipose cells. Insulin can activate its responses in adipose tissue through two INSR splicing variants: INSR-A, which is predominantly expressed in mesenchymal and less-differentiated cells and mainly linked to cell proliferation, and INSR-B, which is more expressed in terminally differentiated cells and coupled to metabolic effects. Recent findings have revealed that different distributions of INSR and an altered INSR-A:INSR-B ratio may contribute to metabolic abnormalities during the onset of insulin resistance and the progression to type 2 diabetes. In this review, we discuss the role of insulin and the INSR in the development and endocrine activity of adipose tissue and the pharmacological implications for the management of obesity and type 2 diabetes."

Although defects in NK cell functions are recognized as important mechanisms for immune evasion of malignant cells, molecular pathways regulating NK cell dysfunction and exhaustion in cancer are largely unknown. Here we tested whether the c-myc proto-oncogene, known to promote cell proliferation, growth, differentiation, and apoptosis by regulating the expression of numerous target genes, may be involved in the mechanism of NK cell abnormalities in patients with lung and gastric cancer. Analysis of c-myc mRNA and protein expression in peripheral blood NK cells, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activity, cell cycle, and cell longevity revealed a significantly decreased expression of c-myc mRNA and protein and mitotic arrest of NK cells in different phases of cell cycle. In addition, a significant decrease of NK cell death was also detected. These data allow the suggestion that defects of NK cell-mediated tumor surveillance may be associated with disturbed c-myc expression in NK cells in cancer patients. A better understanding of the mechanisms of NK cell dysfunction in cancer will help in the NK cell-mediated therapeutic eradication of primary and metastatic cancer cells and prolong patient survival.","Map-Based Cloning and Functional Analysis of YE1 in Rice, Which Is Involved in Light-Dependent Chlorophyll Biogenesis and Photoperiodic Flowering Pathway.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30754644,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 05 29,"Light is one of the most important environmental factors that affect many aspects of plant growth, including chlorophyll (Chl) synthesis and flowering time. Here, we identified a rice mutant, yellow leaf and early flowering (ye1), and characterized the gene YE1 by using a map-based cloning method. YE1 encodes a heme oxygenase, which is localized to the chloroplasts. YE1 is expressed in various green tissues, especially in leaves, with a diurnal-rhythmic expression pattern, and its transcripts is also induced by light during leaf-greening. The mutant displays decreased Chl contents with less and disorderly thylakoid lamellar layers in chloroplasts, which reduced the photosynthesis rate. The early flowering phenotype of ye1 was not photoperiod-sensitive. Furthermore, the expression levels of Chl biosynthetic genes were downregulated in ye1 seedlings during de-etiolation responses to light. We also found that rhythmic expression patterns of genes involved in photoperiodic flowering were altered in the mutant. Based on these results, we infer that YE1 plays an important role in light-dependent Chl biogenesis as well as photoperiodic flowering pathway in rice.",Fluoxetine Induces Apoptosis through Extrinsic/Intrinsic Pathways and Inhibits ERK/NF-κB-Modulated Anti-Apoptotic and Invasive Potential in Hepatocellular Carcinoma Cells In Vitro.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30754643,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 05 29,"The aim of the present study was to verify the effects of fluoxetine on dysregulation of apoptosis and invasive potential in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) SK-Hep1 and Hep3B cells.

The regulation of apoptosis signaling, and anti-apoptotic, proliferation, and metastasis-associated proteins after fluoxetine treatment were assayed by flow cytometry and Western blotting assay. The detection of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) activation after fluoxetine treatment was performed by NF-κB reporter gene assay. The results demonstrated that fluoxetine significantly reduced cell viability, cell migration/invasion, NF-κB, extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) activation, and expression of anti-apoptotic (Cellular FLICE (FADD-like IL-1β-converting enzyme)-inhibitory protein (C-FLIP), Myeloid cell leukemia-1 (MCL-1), X-Linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XAIP), and Survivin), proliferation (Cyclin-D1), angiogenesis (vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)), and metastasis-associated proteins (matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9)). Fluoxetine also significantly induced apoptosis, unregulated extrinsic (activation of first apoptosis signal protein and ligand (Fas/FasL), and caspase-8) and intrinsic (loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) pathways and increased Bcl-2 homologous antagonist killer (BAK) apoptosis signaling. Taken together, these results demonstrated that fluoxetine induced apoptosis through extrinsic/intrinsic pathways and diminished ERK/NF-κB-modulated anti-apoptotic and invasive potential in HCC cells in vitro.",Self-Healing Flexible Conductive Film by Repairing Defects via Flowable Liquid Metal Droplets.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30754642,Micromachines,2019 04 10,"Self-healing flexible conductive films have been fabricated, evaluated, and applied.

Room temperature liquid metal was directly injected into the electrode channels by syringe to form non-contact electrodes. Deionized (DI) water with fluorescent particles was used to test the pumping performance of this EOF pump. According to the experimental results, a flow rate of 5.69 nL/min was reached at a driving voltage of 2 V. The size of this pump is small, and it shows a great potential for implanted applications.

The determined isotropic ""Mexican-hat"" shape of the guest-host potential describing Na motion in the Si28 cage indicates the ""off-center"" position when the temperature is elevated beyond zero. Accordingly, the calculated Na ""off-center"" displacements correlate well with the X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) data (0.4 Å⁻0.5 Å) for a similar composition range (0 < x < 24). The lack of first-principles analysis on quartic anharmonicity motivates us to initiate a self-consistent model to examine the temperature-dependent rattling frequency Ω(T) of the guest (Na, Rb). The predicted values of Ω(T) for Na24Si136 at 300 K are significantly higher (approximately six times larger) than the value at absolute zero, which contrasts with the case of Rb₈Si136. Moreover, underestimation of the isotropic atomic displacement parameter Uiso is caused by the temperature-dependent quartic anharmonicity of Na, and this discrepancy might be offset by the square of the ""off-center"" displacement.","Protective Effect of Koumine, an Alkaloid from Gelsemium Sempervirens, on Injury Induced by H₂O₂ in IPEC-J2 Cells.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30754638,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 05 29,"Medicinal herbal plants have been commonly used for intervention in different diseases and improvement of health worldwide. Koumine, an alkaloid monomer found abundantly in Gelsemium plants, can be effectively used as an antioxidant. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the potential protective effect of koumine against hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂)-induced oxidative stress and apoptosis in porcine intestinal epithelial cell line (IPEC-J2 cells). MTT assays showed that koumine significantly increased cell viability in H₂O₂-mediated IPEC-J2 cells. Preincubation with koumine ameliorated H₂O₂-medicated apoptosis by decreasing reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and efficiently suppressed the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release and malondialdehyde (MDA) production. Moreover, a loss of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione (GSH) activities was restored to normal level in H₂O₂-induced IPEC-J2 cells upon koumine exposure. Furthermore, pretreatment with koumine suppressed H₂O₂-mediated loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, caspase-9 and caspase-3 activation, decrease of Bcl-2 expression and elevation of Bax expressions. Collectively, the results of this study indicated that koumine possesses the cytoprotective effects in IPEC-J2 cells during exposure to H₂O₂ by suppressing production of ROS, inhibiting the caspase-3 activity and influencing the expression of Bax and Bcl-2. Koumine could potentially serve as a protective effect against H₂O₂-induced apoptosis.",Resonant Photoacoustic Spectroscopy of NO₂ with a UV-LED Based Sensor.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30754637,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 02 27,"Nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ) is a poisonous trace gas that requires monitoring in urban areas.

An inexpensive UV-LED with a peak wavelength of 405 nm as radiation source as well as a commercial MEMS microphone for acoustic detection were used. In this work, a cell has been developed that enables a ""non-contact"" feedthrough of the divergent LED beam. Thus, unwanted background noise due to absorption on the inside walls is minimized. As part of the development, an acoustic simulation has been carried out to find the resonance frequencies and to visualize the resulting standing wave patterns in various geometries. The pressure amplitude was calculated for different shapes and sizes. A model iteratively optimized in this way forms the basis of a construction that was built for gas measurement by rapid prototyping methods.

Among these oxides, ZnO showed a promising photocatalytic activity; however, traditional synthetic routes generated by-products and large amounts of secondary waste. Herein, we report the use of bipolar electrochemistry to generate ZnO nanoparticles using deionized water and a zinc metal to conform to green chemistry practices. TEM imaging demonstrated that the sizes of the bipolar-made ZnO particles were smaller than the commercial sample. The presence of structural defects in ZnO was correlated with the chemical shifts analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and by different concentrations of O2- ions in stoichiometric and defected lattice. Further, the diffuse reflectance UV⁻Vis studies demonstrated a blue-shift in the reflectance spectrum for the bipolar-made oxide. This was also an indication of defects in the ZnO lattice, which related to the formation of shallow levels in the bandgap of the material. The structural and morphological differences influenced the photocatalytic characteristics, revealing a higher photocurrent for the bipolar-made ZnO when compared to the reference sample. This was further manifested in lower total resistivity for all anodes made from the non-stoichiometric ZnO, and also in their shorter diffusion length for charge exchange and electron lifetimes."

Parkin is widely neuroprotective through different cellular pathways, as it protects dopaminergic neurons from apoptosis in a series of cellular and animal models of PD. The mitochondrial protein apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) is an important cell death effector, which, upon cellular stress in many paradigms, is redistributed from the mitochondria to the nucleus to function as a proapoptotic factor, mostly independent of caspase activity, while in normal mitochondria it functions as an antiapoptotic factor. AIF is known to participate in dopaminergic neuron loss in experimental PD models and in patients with PD. We, therefore, investigated possible crosstalk between parkin and AIF. By using immunoprecipitation and proximity ligation assays, we demonstrated a physical interaction between the two proteins. Nuclear AIF translocation was significantly reduced by parkin expression in neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells after exposure to an apoptogenic stimulus. These results were confirmed in primary murine cortical neurons, which showed a higher nuclear translocation of AIF in parkin-deficient neurons upon an excitotoxic stimulus. Our results indicate that the interaction of parkin with AIF interferes with the nuclear translocation of AIF, which might contribute to the neuroprotective activity of parkin.","W

NbMoTa has led to four results of the Vickers microhardness, i.e., Hv = 459.2 ± 9.7, 476.0 ± 12.9, 485.3 ± 8.7, and 497.6 ± 5.6. As a result, NbMoTa alloy shows a yield strength (σb) and compressive strain (εp) of 530 Mpa and 8.5% at 1000 °C, leading to better results than traditional refractory alloys such as T-111, C103, and Nb-1Zr, which are commonly used in the aerospace industry.","Gastroprotection of Calein D against Ethanol-Induced Gastric Lesions in Mice: Role of Prostaglandins, Nitric Oxide and Sulfhydryls.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30754621,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 02 24,"Peptic ulcers are currently treated with various drugs, all having serious side effects. The aim of this study was to evaluate the gastroprotective activity of calein D (from Calea urticifolia), a sesquiterpene lactone with a germacrane skeleton. Gastric lesions were induced in mice by administering ethanol (0.2 mL) after oral treatment with calein D at 3, 10 and 30 mg/kg, resulting in 13.15 ± 3.44%, 77.65 ± 7.38% and 95.76 ± 2.18% gastroprotection, respectively, to be compared with that of the control group. The effect found for 30 mg/kg of calein D was not reversed by pretreatment with NG-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME, 70 mg/kg, ip), indomethacin (10 mg/kg, sc) or N-ethylmaleimide (NEM, 10 mg/kg, sc). Hence, the mechanism of action of calein D does not involve NO, prostaglandins or sulfhydryl compounds. Calein D was more potent than carbenoxolone, the reference drug. The findings for the latter are in agreement with previous reports.",Dosimetry of 177Lu-PSMA-617 after Mannitol Infusion and Glutamate Tablet Administration: Preliminary Results of EUDRACT/RSO 2016-002732-32 IRST Protocol.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30754620,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 02 24,"Radio-ligand therapy (RLT) with177Lu-PSMA-617 is a promising option for patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate-cancer (mCRPC). A prospective phase-II study (EUDRACT/RSO,2016-002732-32) on mCRPC is ongoing at IRST (Meldola, Italy). A total of 9 patients (median age: 68 y, range: 53⁻85) were enrolled for dosimetry evaluation of parotid glands (PGs), kidneys, red marrow (RM) and whole body (WB). Folic polyglutamate tablets were orally administered as PGs protectors and 500 mL of a 10% mannitol solution was intravenously infused to reduce kidney uptake. The whole body planar image (WBI) and blood samples were acquired at different times post infusion (1 h, 16⁻24 h, 36⁻48 h and 120 h). Dose calculation was performed with MIRD formalism (OLINDA/EXM software). The median effective half-life was 33.0 h (range: 25.6⁻60.7) for PGs, 31.4 h (12.2⁻80.6) for kidneys, 8.2 h (2.5⁻14.7) for RM and 40.1 h (31.6⁻79.7) for WB. The median doses were 0.48 mGy/MBq (range: 0.33⁻2.63) for PGs, 0.70 mGy/MBq (0.26⁻1.07) for kidneys, 0.044 mGy/MBq (0.023⁻0.067) for RM and 0.04 mGy/MBq (0.02⁻0.11) for WB. A comparison with previously published dosimetric data was performed and a significant difference was found for PGs while no significant difference was observed for the kidneys. For PGs, the possibility of reducing uptake by administering glutamate tablets during RLT seems feasible while further research is warranted for a more focused evaluation of the reduction in kidney uptake.",Mitochondrial Genomes Provide Insights into the Phylogeny of Culicomorpha (Insecta: Diptera).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30754618,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 05 29,"Culicomorpha is a monophyletic group containing most bloodsucking lower dipterans, including many important vectors of pathogens. However, the higher-level phylogenetic relationships within Culicomorpha are largely unresolved, with multiple competing hypotheses based on molecular sequence data. Here we sequenced four nearly complete mitochondrial (mt) genomes representing four culicomorph families, and combined these new data with published mt genomes to reconstruct the phylogenetic relationships of all eight extant culicomorph families. We estimated phylogenies using four datasets and three methods. We also used four-cluster likelihood mapping to study potential incongruent topologies supported by the different datasets and phylogenetic questions generated by the previous studies. The results showed that a clade containing Ceratopogonidae, Thaumaleidae and Simuliidae was the sister group to all other Culicomorpha; in another clade, the Dixidae was basal to the remaining four families; Chaoboridae, Corethrellidae and Culicidae formed a monophyletic group and the Chironomidae was the sister group to this clade; Culicidae and Corethrellidae were sister groups in all trees. Our study provides novel mt genome data in Culicomorpha for three new family representatives, and the resulting mt phylogenomic analysis helps to resolve the phylogeny and taxonomy of Culicomorpha.",Influence of Torsion on Matteucci Effect Signal Parameters in Co-Based Bistable Amorphous Wire.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30754617,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 02 24,"The Matteucci effect (ME) is one of the lesser-known magnetomechanical effects and is most prominent in bistable amorphous wires. It has some experimental applications-Matteucci effect-based magnetic field sensors are very easy to produce and have inherently linear, hybrid analog/digital output signal. The effect is still poorly understood, however, and although it relies on torsion of the wire to manifest, there is no available model, or much experimental data, which would quantitatively connect the ME with the sample twist. In this paper, experimental characteristics of ME signal parameters dependence on torsion in Co-based amorphous bistable wire are presented. The results hint at possible applications, such as rotation or critical current sensors, as well as the necessity of torsion control in the development of ME magnetic field sensors.",Preparative Separation of Diterpene Lactones and Flavones from Andrographis paniculate Using Off-Line Two-Dimensional High-Speed Counter-Current Chromatography.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30754616,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 02 24,"Seven diterpene lactones, andrographolide (1), isoandrographolide (2), neo-andrographolide (3), 14-deoxy-11,12-didehydroandrographolide (4), 14-deoxyandrographiside (5), 14-deoxy-11,12-didehydroandrographiside (6), 3,14-dideoxyandrographolide (10), and three flavones, andrographidine C (7), andrographidine A (8), 5-hydroxy-7,8-dimethoxyflavanone (9) have been successfully and efficiently isolated from A. paniculata using an off-line two dimensional (2D) high-speed counter-current chromatography (HSCCC) method for the first time.

Furthermore, SO₂ and biothiols can provide a reductive environment for lysosomes to carry out their optimal functionality. To this end, the development of single fluorescent probes for imaging SO₂ and biothiols from different emission channels is highly desirable for understanding their physiological nature. Here, a lysosome-targeted fluorescent probe (BPO-DNSP) with a dual reaction site for SO₂ and biothiols was presented. BPO-DNSP can sensitively and selectively respond to SO₂ in the green channel with a large Stokes shift over 105 nm, and to biothiols in the near-infrared emission channel with a large Stokes shift over 109 nm. The emission shift for the two channels was as high as 170 nm. Colocalization experiments verified that BPO-DNSP can selectively enrich lysosomes. Notably, BPO-DNSP can not only be used to image intracellular SO₂ and biothiols from two different channels, but also to monitor the conversion of biothiols to SO₂ without adding exogenous enzymes in living HeLa cells."
