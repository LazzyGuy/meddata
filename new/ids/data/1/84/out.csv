Recent studies have demonstrated that attention samples locations and objects rhythmically. Interestingly, periodic sampling not only operates over objects in the same scene but also occurs for multiple perceptual predictions that are held in attention for incoming inputs. However, how the brain coordinates perceptual predictions that are endowed with different levels of bottom-up saliency information remains unclear. To address the issue, we used a fine-grained behavioral measurement to investigate the temporal dynamics of processing of high- and low-salient visual stimuli, which have equal possibility to occur within experimental blocks. We demonstrate that perceptual predictions associated with different levels of saliency are organized via a theta-band rhythmic course and are optimally processed in different phases within each theta-band cycle. Meanwhile, when the high- and low-salient stimuli are presented in separate blocks and thus not competing with each other, the periodic behavioral profile is no longer present. In summary, our findings suggest that attention samples and coordinates multiple perceptual predictions through a theta-band rhythm according to their relative saliency. Our results, in combination with previous studies, advocate the rhythmic nature of attentional process.",Preparing to Stop Action Increases Beta Band Power in Contralateral Sensorimotor Cortex.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30633601,Journal of cognitive neuroscience,2019 06 10,"How do we prepare to stop ourselves in the future? Here, we used scalp EEG to test the hypothesis that people prepare to stop by putting parts of their motor system (specifically, here, sensorimotor cortex) into a suppressed state ahead of time. On each trial, participants were cued to prepare to stop one hand and then initiated a bimanual movement. On a minority of trials, participants were instructed to stop the cued hand while continuing quickly with the other. We used a guided multivariate source separation method to examine oscillatory power changes in presumed sensorimotor cortical areas. We observed that, when people prepare to stop a hand, there were above-baseline beta band power increases (12-24 Hz) in contralateral cortex up to a second earlier. This increase in beta band power in the proactive period was functionally relevant because it predicted, trial by trial, the degree of selectivity with which participants subsequently stopped a response but did not relate to movement per se. Thus, preparing to stop particular response channels corresponds to increased beta power from contralateral (sensorimotor) cortex, and this relates specifically to subsequent stopping. These results provide a high temporal resolution and frequency-specific electrophysiological signature of the preparing-to-stop state that is pertinent to future studies of mitigating provocation, including in clinical disorders. The results also highlight the utility of guided multivariate source separation for revealing the cortical dynamics underlying both movement and response suppression.",Dissociation between Private and Social Counterfactual Value Signals Following Ventromedial Prefrontal Cortex Damage.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30633600,Journal of cognitive neuroscience,2019 03 29,"Individuals learn by comparing the outcome of chosen and unchosen actions. A negative counterfactual value signal is generated when this comparison is unfavorable. This can happen in private as well as in social settings-where the foregone outcome results from the choice of another person. We hypothesized that, despite sharing similar features such as supporting learning, these two counterfactual signals might implicate distinct brain networks. We conducted a neuropsychological study on the role of private and social counterfactual value signals in risky decision-making. Patients with lesions in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), lesion controls, and healthy controls repeatedly chose between lotteries. In private trials, participants could observe the outcomes of their choices and the outcomes of the unselected lotteries. In social trials, participants could also see the other player's choices and outcome. At the time of outcome, vmPFC patients were insensitive to private counterfactual value signals, whereas their responses to social comparison were similar to those of control participants. At the time of choice, intact vmPFC was necessary to integrate counterfactual signals in decisions, although amelioration was observed during the course of the task, possibly driven by social trials. We conclude that if the vmPFC is critical in processing private counterfactual signals and in integrating those signals in decision-making, then distinct brain areas might support the processing of social counterfactual signals.",Cardiac Findings in Fetal and Pediatric Autopsies: A 15-Year Retrospective Review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30633599,Fetal and pediatric pathology,2019 04 15,Congenital heart defects (CHDs) carry significant morbidity and mortality in pediatric patients.

The aims of this study were to examine trends in non-vaccine-type HPV: 1) genetically related to vaccine types (to assess for cross-protection) and 2) genetically unrelated to vaccine types (to assess for type replacement), among young women 13-26 years of age during the 11 years after HPV vaccine introduction. Participants were recruited from a hospital-based teen health center and a community health department for four cross-sectional surveillance studies between 2006 and 2017. Participants completed a survey that assessed sociodemographic characteristics and behaviors, and cervicovaginal swabs were collected and tested for 36 HPV genotypes. We determined changes in proportions of non-vaccine-type HPV prevalence and conducted logistic regression to determine the odds of infection across the surveillance studies, propensity-score adjusted to control for selection bias. Analyses were stratified by vaccination status. Among vaccinated women who received only the 4-valent vaccine (n = 1,540), the adjusted prevalence of HPV types genetically related to HPV16 decreased significantly by 45.8% (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 0.48, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.31-0.74) from 2006-2017, demonstrating evidence of cross-protection. The adjusted prevalence of HPV types genetically related to HPV18 did not change significantly (14.2% decrease, AOR = 0.83, 95% CI = 0.56-1.21). The adjusted prevalence of HPV types genetically unrelated to vaccine types did not change significantly (4.2% increase, AOR = 1.09, CI = 0.80-1.48), demonstrating no evidence of type replacement. Further studies are needed to monitor for cross-protection and possible type replacement after introduction of the 9-valent HPV vaccine.",Blood coagulation: a powerful bactericidal mechanism of human innate immunity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30633597,International reviews of immunology,2019 04 04,"Infection proliferates and disseminates rapidly and so innate immunity should react effectively and fast. Innate immunity mechanisms depend upon fluid dynamics and are different in compartments with slow (the tissues) and rapid (the bloodstream) liquid flow. In the tissues, coagulation initiated by clotting factors, platelets and erythrocytes, is prompt and effective mechanism of the first line of antibacterial defense. Resident macrophages, transmigrated neutrophils, monocytes, NETs and platelets are the second line of the defense. In the bloodstream the first line of innate immunity defense are erythrocytes that kill pathogens by oxygen, released from oxyhemoglobin (oxycytosis); the second line of the defense is coagulation that in case of overactivation may cause disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Blood coagulation is the fastest mechanism of infection confinement and inactivation. It is the first and the last line of innate immunity defense and occurs both in the tissues and the bloodstream.",Examining the effects of role play practice in enhancing clinical skills to assess and manage suicide risk.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30633596,"Journal of mental health (Abingdon, England)",2019 01 11,"Mental health professionals (MHPs) often lack skills necessary to effectively manage suicide risk.

The aim of this study is to prepare solid lipid microparticles (SLMs) encapsulating LP and to assess their biochemical and clinical effects in the management of chronic periodontitis. Optimization of SLMs was performed by assessing particle size and LP entrapment efficiency. Clinical study included 16 chronic periodontitis patients allocated into two groups, Group I was managed by scaling and root planing (SRP) and local delivery of LP loaded SLMs, while Group II was managed by SRP only. Protein carbonyl (PC) levels as a biomarker of oxidative stress and drug concentration in gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) were assessed at different time intervals. Results revealed that optimum formula of SLMs had a particle size of 77.28 µm and entrapped 98.03% of LP. SLMs recorded 30 d of drug release with no burst effect. Patients treated with LP SLMs showed significantly lower levels of PC after SRP compared to those treated with SRP only, in addition to improvement in the measured clinical parameters. In conclusion, locally delivered LP SLMs along with SRP could have a protective effect over periodontal tissues and it has the ability to decrease oxidative damage of proteins in diseased periodontium.",Smart aptamer-modified calcium carbonate nanoparticles for controlled release and targeted delivery of epirubicin and melittin into cancer cells in vitro and in vivo.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30633594,Drug development and industrial pharmacy,2019 06 14,"To explore the effect of combination therapy of epirubicin (Epi) and melittin (Mel) to cancer cells, calcium carbonate nanoparticles (CCN), as carriers, were developed which were modified with MUC1-Dimer aptamers as targeting agents. Both Epi and Mel were delivered at the same time to cancer cells overexpressing the target of MUC1 aptamer, mucin 1 glycoproteins (MCF7 and C26 cells). CCN were prepared with a water-in-oil emulsion method. Epi and Mel were separately encapsulated in CCN and the nanoparticles were modified with MUC1-Dimer aptamers. In vitro studies, including MTT assay, flow cytometry analysis and fluorescence imaging were applied to investigate the targeting and cell proliferation inhibition capabilities of MUC1-Dimer aptamer-CCN-Mel complex and MUC1-Dimer aptamer-CCN-Epi complex in the target (MCF-7 and C26 cells) and nontarget (HepG2) cells. Also, the function of the developed complexes was analyzed using in vivo tumor growth inhibition. The release of Epi from MUC1-Dimer aptamer-CCN-Epi complex was pH-sensitive. Cellular uptake studies showed more internalization of the MUC1-Dimer aptamer-CCN-Epi complex into MCF-7 and C26 cells (target) compared to HepG2 cells (nontarget). Interestingly, the MUC1-Dimer aptamer-CCN-Mel complex and MUC1-Dimer aptamer-CCN-Epi complex indicated very low toxicity as compared to target cells. Moreover, co-delivery of Epi and Mel using the mixture of MUC1-Dimer aptamer-CCN-Mel complex and MUC1-Dimer aptamer-CCN-Epi complex exhibited strong synergistic cytotoxicity in MCF-7 and C26 cells. Furthermore, the presented complexes had a better function to control tumor growth in vivo compared to free Epi.",Elevated admission serum calcium phosphate product as an independent risk factor for acute kidney injury in hospitalized patients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30633593,Hospital practice (1995),2019 04 17,"Increased serum calcium-phosphate product (CaP) can result in acute kidney injury (AKI) due to tubular and interstitial calcium phosphate deposits.

The study aimed to increment the previous literature in this field using a New Zealand population. We used a combined sample of 784 university students, with 173 participants completing the MMPI-2-RF with instruction to underreport in the context of applying for a job, and 611 completing the test under standard instructions. Results indicated that individuals who completed the MMPI-2-RF with underreporting instructions exhibited significantly lower scores on the majority of the MMPI-2-RF substantive scales, and significantly higher scores on the L-r and K-r validity scales. Additionally, L-r and K-r added incremental predictive utility over one another when differentiating the standard instruction and underreporting groups. Classification accuracy analyses provided additional evidence for the utility of the L-r and K-r scales by supporting their respective cut scores listed in the MMPI-2-RF manual (Ben-Porath & Tellegen, 2011 ).

For example, stress reactivity-operationalized as the within-person coupling of stress and positive or negative affect-is an important predictor of various (mental) health outcomes and has often been assumed to be a more or less stable personality trait. However, issues of reliability of these couplings have been largely neglected so far. In this work, we present an estimate for the reliability of within-person couplings that can be easily obtained using the user-modifiable R code accompanying this work. Results of a simulation study show that this index performs well even in the context of unbalanced data due to missing values. We demonstrate the application of this index in a measurement burst study targeting the reliability and test-retest correlation of stress reactivity estimates operationalized as within-person couplings in a daily diary design. Reliability and test-retest correlations of stress reactivity estimates were rather low, challenging the implicit assumption of stress reactivity as a stable person-level variable. We highlight key factors that researchers planning studies targeting interindividual differences in within-person couplings should consider to maximize reliability.",In vitro activity of resorcinarene-chlorambucil conjugates for therapy in human chronic myelogenous leukemia cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30633576,Drug development and industrial pharmacy,2019 06 14,"A possible way of improving the activity and selectivity profile of antitumor agents is to design drug carrier systems employing soluble macromolecules.

Evaluation of the cytotoxicity of the resorcinarene-PAMAM-dendrimer-chlorambucil conjugate employing a sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay in K-562 (human chronic myelogenous leukemia cells) demonstrated that the conjugate was more potent as an antiproliferative agent than chlorambucil.",Investigation of in vitro permeability and in vivo pharmacokinetic behavior of bare and functionalized MCM-41 and MCM-48 mesoporous silica nanoparticles: a burst and controlled drug release system for raloxifene.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30633575,Drug development and industrial pharmacy,2019 06 14,"In the present work, MCM-41 and MCM-48 type of nanoparticles were successfully engineered. Effect of nanosize and amine functionalization on drug release, in vitro intestinal absorption and in vivo pharmacokinetic behavior was investigated in a comprehensive manner. The tailor-made bare and surface decorated MCM-41 and MCM-48 were synthesized and evaluated for their mesoporous skeleton, pore size, particle size, surface area, zeta potential, etc. by nitrogen sorption, DLS, TEM, etc. Incorporation of raloxifene (RLF) was affirmed using optimized immersion-solvent evaporation technique and its success confirmed by DSC, IR, and XRD analysis. TGA analysis revealed higher %grafting of amine groups on the exterior and larger RLF encapsulation into mesoporous derivate. The detailed in vitro release study revealed SGF to be the most compatible media for RLF showing an initial burst release from pristine nanoparticles and a delayed release from surface coated nanoparticles. Furthermore, release kinetics model data demonstrated Weibull and Higuchi as the best fit models for bare and amine-functionalized nanoparticles respectively. Moreover, an in vitro permeability study on Caco-2 cell line revealed higher absorption by engineered nanoparticle as compared to pure RLF and its marketed formulation. The supremacy in the in vivo pharmacokinetic parameters of RLF-41 and RLF-48 was demonstrated with 3.33 and 3.50 times enhancement in the bioavailability of RLF with respect to RLF suspension.

Subsequent efforts to discover and isolate a similar active principle from yeast and plants driven by the hope to identify insulin-like/mimetic molecules with critical advantages in the pharmacokinetic profile and expenditure of production compared to authentic human insulin were not successful. As a consequence, it has generally been assumed that hormones evolved exclusively during course of the evolution of vertebrate endocrine organs, implying a rather recent origin. Concomitantly, the existence and physiological role of vertebrate hormones in lower multi- and unicellular eukaryotes have remained a rather controversial subject over decades, albeit there is some evidence that hormones and hormone-binding proteins resembling those of vertebrates are expressed in fungi and yeast. Past and recent findings on the existence of insulin-like and mimetic materials, such as the glucose tolerance factor, in lower eukaryotes, in particular Neurospora crassa and yeast, will be presented. These data provide further evidence for the provocative view that the evolutionary roots of the vertebrate endocrine system may be far more ancient than is generally believed and that the identification and characterisation of insulin-like/mimetic molecules from lower eukaryotes may be useful for future drug discovery efforts."

From these 14, the 10 most resistant isolates were selected for further study and were found to include 9 Gram-negative and 1 Gram-positive bacterial strains. Multi-antibiotic-resistance profiles were detected for 6 out of the 10 selected isolates. All the tested Gram-negative isolates (n = 9) harbored a plasmid-encoded merA gene.

Adult,2019 01 11,"Numerous advantages of and concerns about computerized neuropsychological assessment systems have been noted. Here we report a program evaluation of incorporating a computerized system, the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB), in our tertiary assessment center for Veterans. Patients were 23 consecutive referrals to the Western War Related Illness and Injury Study Center, an interdisciplinary assessment center within the Veterans Affairs Healthcare System for Veterans with complex medical presentations. Patients were administered both the CANTAB and a brief traditional neuropsychological battery. The correlation between global composite scores from each method was .71 (p < .05), indicating ""good"" concordance. Concordance was ""fair"" to ""good"" for scores on specific cognitive domains. However, concordance was lower when classifying patients' cognition as ""impaired"" or ""not-impaired"" based on a cutoff score. Despite the CANTAB's primarily visuospatial interface, discrepancy between the two methods' scores was not associated with patients' visuospatial abilities. The two methods were similarly sensitive to deficits associated with posttraumatic stress disorder, which is prevalent among the Center's patients. The CANTAB was judged to be a valid and useful complement to, but not an acceptable alternative to a traditional neuropsychologist-administered cognitive assessment battery for the Center's specific patients and needs.",Lysine-Targeted Inhibitors and Chemoproteomic Probes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30633551,Annual review of biochemistry,2019 01 11,"Covalent inhibitors are widely used in drug discovery and chemical biology. Although covalent inhibitors are frequently designed to react with noncatalytic cysteines, many ligand binding sites lack an accessible cysteine. Here, we review recent advances in the chemical biology of lysine-targeted covalent inhibitors and chemoproteomic probes. By analyzing crystal structures of proteins bound to common metabolites and enzyme cofactors, we identify a large set of mostly unexplored lysines that are potentially targetable with covalent inhibitors. In addition, we describe mass spectrometry-based approaches for determining proteome-wide lysine ligandability and lysine-reactive chemoproteomic probes for assessing drug-target engagement. Finally, we discuss the design of amine-reactive inhibitors that form reversible covalent bonds with their protein targets.

Of course, these reactions are inherently very favorable, and they occur rapidly with the release of a great deal of energy at high temperature. Nature has been able to tap this sequestered reservoir of energy with great spatial and temporal selectivity at ambient temperatures through the evolution of oxidase and oxygenase enzymes. One mechanism used by these enzymes for O2 activation has been studied in detail for the soluble form of the enzyme methane monooxygenase. These studies have revealed the step-by-step process of O2 activation and insertion into the ultimately stable C-H bond of methane. Additionally, an elegant regulatory mechanism has been defined that enlists size selection and quantum tunneling to allow methane oxidation to occur specifically in the presence of more easily oxidized substrates.

We show that, at the subnano-scale, scaling relationships can be broken through catalyst dynamics. Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), which can be catalyzed by Pt nanoparticles, is used as our study case. Subnanometer gas-phase and graphene-deposited Pt n cluster catalysts are shown to exhibit poor correlation between binding energies of the intermediates, O, OH, and OOH, involved in the scaling relationships for ORR. The effect is due to the highly fluxional behavior of subnanometer clusters, which easily adapt their structures to the bound adsorbates and varying coverage and in some cases even reshape the structure upon changing environment. This fluxional behavior is also commonplace for clusters and contrasts them to extended surfaces, suggesting that breaking scaling relationships is likely a rule more than an exception in nanocluster catalysis.",Solid-Phase-Based Total Synthesis and Stereochemical Assignment of the Cryptic Natural Product Aurantizolicin.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30633530,Organic letters,2019 03 04,The total synthesis and stereochemical assignment of the polyazole cyclopeptide aurantizolicin was achieved by connecting the solution synthesis of building blocks with solid-phase peptide synthesis.

Whole antibodies significantly accumulate in target molecule-expressing tumors but frequently persist too long in the blood circulation for imaging purposes. We investigated the utility of whole antibodies, 64Cu-labeled via a urokinase-substrate linker, and their exogenous urokinase-responsive cleavage to enhance clearance of immuno-PET probes from the blood and shorten the time required to develop adequate imaging contrast. Specifically, we used 64Cu-labeled trastuzumab in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive tumor-bearing mice. 64Cu-labeled trastuzumab with a urokinase-cleavage site (64Cu-CB-TE1A1P-USL-trastuzumab) was synthesized using a bifunctional chelator incorporating an urokinase substrate peptide. Urokinase cleavage was analyzed in vitro by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry and radio-gel permeation-high-performance liquid chromatography. Improvements in radioisotope clearance and HER2-imaging by urokinase injection were evaluated by PET imaging and ex vivo biodistribution studies in A431 tumor-bearing mice. 64Cu-CB-TE1A1P-USL-trastuzumab was cleaved into smaller radioactive fragments by 20 000 IU/mL urokinase treatment in vitro at an efficacy of ∼95%. The probe targeted HER2 in A431 tumors in mice within 24 h post-injection, and approximately two-thirds of the probe in the blood circulation was eliminated via renal clearance of radioactive fragments after three urokinase injections. Therefore, the tumor/blood ratio increased 3.0-fold. Without urokinase injection, the tumor accumulation of 64Cu-CB-TE1A1P-USL-trastuzumab slowly increased, and the blood radioactivity decreased over 72 h. However, the tumor/blood ratios in mice after three urokinase injections were higher at 24 h than those in mice without injections at 72 h. The results indicate that our approach shortened the time required to develop adequate imaging contrast of immuno-PET by >2 days. Therefore, this approach can benefit high-sensitivity imaging under lower radioactive decay conditions and can decrease patient radiation exposure. In addition, it could reduce other adverse effects of radioimmunotherapy."

Herein, we present a systematic computational study to understand the mechanism and origins of substrate-controlled chemoselectivity of the C-H functionalization reactions (hydroarylation vs cascade cyclization). For the disubstituted allene system, the computed mechanism consists of three main phases: C-H activation, allene migratory insertion, and protonation giving the hydroarylation product. All of these steps are feasible, in agreement with the good yield under the mild experimental conditions. On the other hand, for the trisubstituted allene system, hydroarylation is suppressed due to the higher energy barrier for the protonation step arising from the disfavored ligand-substrate steric repulsions between the carboxide ligand and the substituent group in the allene substrate; our computational results demonstrate that, after the allene insertion leading to a seven-membered cyclometalated intermediate, it undergoes a reaction pathway involving sequential ""ketone to enol"" isomerization, a 1,4-heteroaryl shift, and β-methoxyl elimination giving the pyrroloindolone product. In contrast, this isomerization → heteroaryl shift → β-methoxyl elimination process is unworkable in the disubstituted allene system, because the protonation step takes place more favorably owing to the lack of ligand-substrate steric interactions. The findings taken together give an insight into the role of the ligand-substrate interactions in directing the competitive pathways and differentiating the energies of key transition states by steric repulsions.",Role of Conformational Flexibility in Monte Carlo Simulations of Many-Protein Systems.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30633517,Journal of chemical theory and computation,2019 02 22,"Efficient computational modeling of biological systems characterized by high concentrations of macromolecules often relies on rigid-body Brownian Dynamics or Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. However, the accuracy of rigid-body models is limited by the fixed conformation of the simulated biomolecules. Multi-conformation Monte Carlo (mcMC) simulations of protein solutions incorporate conformational flexibility via a conformational swap trial move within a predetermined library of discrete protein structures, thereby alleviating artifacts arising from the use of a single protein conformation. Here, we investigate the impact of the number of distinct protein structures in the conformational library and the extent of conformational sampling used in its generation on structural observables computed from simulations of hen egg white lysozyme (HEWL), human γD-Crystallin, and bovine γB-Crystallin solutions. We find that the importance of specific protocols for the construction of the protein structure library is strongly dependent on the nature of the simulated system.",O2 Adsorption Associated with Sulfur Vacancies on MoS2 Microspheres.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30633516,Inorganic chemistry,2019 02 15,"MoS2 is well-known for its catalytic properties, mainly to adsorb hydrogenous or carbonaceous materials. However, the effect of MoS2 on the oxygen adsorption has been investigated only a few times thus far. In this work, we first studied the adsorbability of O2 by MoS2 through the analysis of Li2O2 growth on the surface of flower-like MoS2 microspheres with different concentrations of sulfur vacancies, which can be applied as the highly active electrocatalysts for Li-O2 batteries. The enhancement of battery performance for the Def-MoS2@CTs (CTs = carbon textile substrates) with a larger concentration of sulfur vacancies (S/Mo = 1.61) can be achieved. The experimental and theoretical results confirm that the sulfur vacancies play a crucial role in the adsorption process and thus affect the morphology and nucleation of Li2O2. In addition, a fundamental catalytic mechanism for this adsorption process is also proposed. These results provide a new insight into the development of a highly active electrocatalyst by introducing a large concentration of defects for Li-O2 batteries.",Conditional Reversible Work Coarse-Grained Models with Explicit Electrostatics-An Application to Butylmethylimidazolium Ionic Liquids.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30633515,Journal of chemical theory and computation,2019 02 15,"Parametrization of nonbonded interactions is fundamental in the development of new coarse-grained (CG) models. The conditional reversible work (CRW) method is unique among the systematic coarse-graining methods since it requires only the simulation of two molecules in vacuo, making parametrizations of new models computationally inexpensive. This method has been applied successfully to apolar systems and has recently been extended for the parametrization of models with explicit electrostatics. In this work, the ECRW method is used to parametrize models for butylmethylimidazolium (BMIM) ionic liquids with three different anions. Results of subsequent CG simulations are used to illustrate the strengths and weaknesses of the resulting models. In particular, the structural and dynamical properties of the bulk, as well as the behavior at the liquid-vapor interface, are studied.

In this work, we reveal that, under the proper circumstance, Mo and Te atoms can rearrange themselves to transform from a polycrystalline 1T' phase into a single-crystalline 2H phase in a large scale. We manifest the mechanisms of the solid-to-solid transformation by conducting density functional theory calculations, transmission electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and Raman spectroscopy. The phase transformation is well described by the time-temperature-transformation diagram.

Though fluorescent tracers are used for targeted in vivo imaging, the lack of photostability and biocompatibility of many current fluorophores hinder their use in several applications involving long-term, continuous imaging. To address these problems, fluorescent nanodiamonds (FNDs), which exhibit infinite photostability and excellent biocompatibility, were explored as fluorophores in tracers for targeting VEGF receptors in growing tumors. To explore FND utility for imaging tumor VEGF receptors, we used click-chemistry to conjugate multiple copies of an engineered single-chain version of VEGF site-specifically derivatized with trans-cyclooctene (scVEGF-TCO) to 140 nm FND. The resulting targeting conjugates, FND-scVEGF, were then tested for functional activity of the scVEGF moieties through biochemical and tissue culture experiments and for selective tumor uptake in Balb/c mice with induced 4T1 carcinoma. We found that FND-scVEGF conjugates retain high affinity to VEGF receptors in cell culture experiments and observed preferential accumulation of FND-scVEGF in tumors relative to untargeted FND. Microspectroscopy provided unambiguous determination of FND within tissue by way of the unique spectral shape of nitrogen-vacancy induced fluorescence. These results validate and invite the use of targeted FND for diagnostic imaging and encourage further optimization of FND for fluorescence brightness.",Proton Affinities of N-Heterocyclic Olefins and Their Implications for Organocatalyst Design.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30633507,The Journal of organic chemistry,2019 02 15,"The proton affinity (PA) of a range of structurally different N-heterocycles with an exocyclic double bond (= N-heterocyclic olefins, NHOs) has been determined using DFT calculations on the BLYP/def2-TZVPP level. It was found that NHOs belong to the upper end of the superbasicity scale, covering PA values from 262 to 296 kcal/mol. Different types of NHOs are compared with each other and with frequently employed organocatalysts. To boost PA, (a) the ability to delocalize the positive charge and (b) steric pressure/ring strain which can be relieved after protonation were identified as key tuning parameters. Importantly, by analyzing PA alongside partial charges and molecular electrostatic potentials, it is shown that an increase of double bond polarization is not a necessary prerequisite for high PA. In contrast, the more basic, more sterically congested NHOs minimize unfavorable interactions by partly pyramidalyzing the nitrogen atoms, rendering the olefinic bond less electron rich and less polarized. These findings are in excellent agreement with experimental evidence on NHO catalysis, not only providing guidelines for a more rational design regarding PA/basicity but also suggesting that NHOs could be specifically tailored toward either nucleophilic or base-type reaction pathways."

Development of engineered tissue should optimize organization and function of cells and tissue in vitro as well as in vivo. Surface topography is one factor controlling cellular behavior and tissue development. By topographical patterning of biocompatible materials, highly functionalized scaffolds can be developed. Gelatin is hereby a promising candidate due to its biocompatibility and biodegradability. It is low in cost and easy to handle, enabling a variety of applications in science and medicine. However, for biomedical applications at physiological conditions, gelatin has to be additionally stabilized since its gel-sol-transition temperature lies beneath the human body temperature. This is realized by a reagent-free cross-linking technique utilizing electron beam treatment. By topographical patterning, gelatin can be functionalized toward scaffolds for cell cultivation and tissue development. Thereby, customized patterns are transferred onto gelatin hydrogels via molds. Thermal stabilization of gelatin is then achieved by electron-induced cross-linking. In this study, we investigate the influence of gelatin concentration and irradiation dose on pattern transfer, long-term stability of topographically patterned gelatin hydrogels, and their impact on the cellular behavior of human umbilical vein endothelial cells as well as normal human dermal fibroblasts. We will show that contact guidance occurs for both cell types due to a concrete stripe pattern. In addition, the presented studies show a high degree of cytocompatibility, indicating a high potential of topographically patterned gelatin hydrogels as tissue development scaffold for prospective biomedical applications.",Dynamics of Residential Water-Soluble Organic Gases: Insights into Sources and Sinks.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30633495,Environmental science & technology,2019 02 27,"Water-soluble organic gas (WSOG) concentrations are elevated in homes. However, WSOG sources, sinks, and concentration dynamics are poorly understood. We observed substantial variations in 23 residential indoor WSOG concentrations measured in real time in a North Carolina, U.S., home over several days with a high-resolution time-of-flight chemical ionization mass spectrometer equipped with iodide reagent ion chemistry (I-HR-ToF-CIMS). Concentrations of acetic, formic, and lactic acids ranged from 30-130, 15-53, and 2.5-360 μg m-3, respectively. Concentrations of several WSOGs, including acetic and formic acids, decreased considerably (∼30-50%) when the air conditioner (AC) cycled on, suggesting that the AC system is an important sink for indoor WSOGs. In contrast to nonpolar organic gases, indoor WSOG loss rate coefficients were substantial for compounds with high oxygen-to-carbon (O/C) ratios (e.g., 1.6-2.2 h-1 for compounds with O/C > 0.75 when the AC system was off). Loss rate coefficients in the AC system were more uncertain but were estimated to be 1.5 h-1. Elevated concentrations of lactic acid coincided with increased human occupancy and cooking. We report several WSOGs emitted from cooking and cleaning as well as transported in from outdoors. In addition to indoor air chemistry, these results have implications to exposure and human health.",Suppressing Self-Discharge of Vanadium Diboride by Zwitterionicity of the Polydopamine Coating Layer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30633494,ACS applied materials & interfaces,2019 02 15,"The vanadium boride (VB2) air battery is currently known as a primary battery with the highest theoretical specific capacity, 4060 mA h g-1, which originates from an extraordinary 11 electrons per VB2 molecule oxidation process. However, the parasitical reaction between VB2 and hydroxide ions in the alkaline electrolyte leads to obvious self-discharge, which results in severe capacity loss during discharge. In this work, we applied the polydopamine (PDA) membrane to modify the surface of VB2 particles, which contains amine groups and phenolic hydroxyl groups exhibiting fully reversible, pH-switchable permselectivity. The ""smart"" membrane with pH-switching characteristics successfully coordinated the conflict between the electrolyte and VB2 in the open circuit to avoid corrosion but also ensured that the hydroxide ions can enter the VB2 particle surface to participate in the reaction during discharge. According to the corrosion suppression test, the remaining amount of VB2@PDA is 90 wt % stored at 65 °C for 2 weeks, which is 10 wt % more than the uncoated VB2. The assembled pouch cell with the VB2@PDA anode can deliver a high capacity of 325 mA h at 250 mA g-1, retaining an improved Coulombic efficiency of 86.3%, which is 18.7% higher than that of the cell with the raw VB2 anode. Moreover, the 0.05 V higher discharge voltage of the VB2@PDA-based cell further shows that the PDA membrane can effectively conduct hydroxide ions during discharge.",Top-Down Synthesis of Nanostructured Platinum-Lanthanide Alloy Oxygen Reduction Reaction Catalysts: Pt xPr/C as an Example.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30633493,ACS applied materials & interfaces,2019 02 15,"The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is of great interest for future sustainable energy conversion and storage, especially concerning fuel cell applications. The preparation of active, affordable, and scalable electrocatalysts and their application in fuel cell engines of hydrogen cars is a prominent step toward the reduction of air pollution, especially in urban areas. Alloying nanostructured Pt with lanthanides is a promising approach to enhance its catalytic ORR activity, whereby the development of a simple synthetic route turned out to be a nontrivial endeavor. Herein, for the first time, we present a successful single-step, scalable top-down synthetic route for Pt-lanthanide alloy nanoparticles, as witnessed by the example of Pr-alloyed Pt nanoparticles. The catalyst was characterized by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and photoelectron spectroscopy, and its electrocatalytic oxygen reduction activity was investigated using a rotating disk electrode technique. Pt xPr/C showed ∼3.5 times higher [1.96 mA/cm2Pt, 0.9 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)] specific activity and ∼1.7 times higher (0.7 A/mgPt, 0.9 V vs RHE) mass activity compared to commercial Pt/C catalysts. On the basis of previous findings and characterization of the Pt xPr/C catalyst, the activity improvement over commercial Pt/C originates from a lattice strain introduced by the alloying process.",A Combination of Tri-Leucine and Angiopep-2 Drives a Polyanionic Polymalic Acid Nanodrug Platform Across the Blood-Brain Barrier.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30633492,ACS nano,2019 02 28,"One of the major problems facing the treatment of neurological disorders is the poor delivery of therapeutic agents into the brain. Our goal is to develop a multifunctional and biodegradable nanodrug delivery system that crosses the blood-brain barrier (BBB) to access brain tissues affected by neurological disease. In this study, we synthesized a biodegradable nontoxic β-poly(l-malic acid) (PMLA or P) as a scaffold to chemically bind the BBB crossing peptides Angiopep-2 (AP2), MiniAp-4 (M4), and the transferrin receptor ligands cTfRL and B6. In addition, a trileucine endosome escape unit (LLL) and a fluorescent marker (rhodamine or rh) were attached to the PMLA backbone. The pharmacokinetics, BBB penetration, and biodistribution of nanoconjugates were studied in different brain regions and at multiple time points via optical imaging. The optimal nanoconjugate, P/LLL/AP2/rh, produced significant fluorescence in the parenchyma of cortical layers II/III, the midbrain colliculi, and the hippocampal CA1-3 cellular layers 30 min after a single intravenous injection; clearance was observed after 4 h. The nanoconjugate variant P/LLL/rh lacking AP2, or the variant P/AP2/rh lacking LLL, showed significantly less BBB penetration. The LLL moiety appeared to stabilize the nanoconjugate, while AP2 enhanced BBB penetration. Finally, nanoconjugates containing the peptides M4, cTfRL, and B6 displayed comparably little and/or inconsistent infiltration of brain parenchyma, likely due to reduced trans-BBB movement. P/LLL/AP2/rh can now be functionalized with intra-brain targeting and drug treatment moieties that are aimed at molecular pathways implicated in neurological disorders.",Simple near-Infrared Nonfullerene Acceptors Enable Organic Solar Cells with >9% Efficiency.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30633491,ACS applied materials & interfaces,2019 02 21,"Nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs) based on calamitic-shaped small molecules are being developed rapidly to improve the photoelectron conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of organic solar cells. NFAs with light absorption extended to the near-infrared (NIR) region are of interest because they play a pivotal role in both organic tandem cells and semitransparent devices. In this work, two simple acceptor-donor-acceptor-structured NFAs (CPDT-4Cl and CPDT-4F) have been designed and synthesized. Featured with dimerized 4H-cyclopenta[1,2-b:5,4-b']dithiophene (CPDT) as the electron-donating core and Cl- or F-substituted 2-(3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene)malononitrile as the electron-accepting unit, the absorption spectra of two NFAs are extended to the NIR region with an absorption edge at approximately 910 nm. In conjunction with the polymer donor material PBDB-T, a PCE of 9.47% was achieved by using a CPDT-4F-based device with a short-circuit current density of up to 20.1 mA/cm2, which slightly outperforms its counterpart CPDT-4Cl (PCE = 9.28%) under the same condition.

The sensor comprising PbTiO3 nanoplates (NPs) exhibited a high response (resistance ratio = 80.4) to 5 ppm ethanol at 300 °C and could detect trace concentrations of ethanol down to 100 ppb. Moreover, the sensor showed high ethanol selectivity and nearly the same sensing characteristics despite the wide range of humidity variation from 20 to 80% RH. The mechanism for humidity-independent gas sensing was elucidated using diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectra.

Persons who inject drugs (PWID) are at higher risk of infectious and noninfectious skin, pulmonary, cardiac, neurologic, and other causes of morbidity and mortality. Nonjudgmental inquiries about current drug use can uncover information about readiness for addiction treatment and identify modifiable risk factors for complications of injection drug use. All PWID should be screened for human immunodeficiency virus infection, latent tuberculosis, and hepatitis B and C, and receive vaccinations for hepatitis A and B, tetanus, and pneumonia if indicated. Pre-exposure prophylaxis for human immunodeficiency virus infection should also be offered. Naloxone should be prescribed to those at risk of opioid overdose. Skin and soft tissue infections are the most common medical complication in PWID and the top reason for hospitalization in these patients. Signs of systemic infection require hospitalization, blood cultures, and a comprehensive history and physical examination to determine the source of infection. PWID have a higher incidence of community-acquired pneumonia and are at risk of other pulmonary complications, including opioid-associated pulmonary edema, asthma, and foreign body granulomatosis. Infectious endocarditis is the most common cardiac complication associated with injection drug use and more often involves the right-sided heart valves, which may not present with heart murmurs or peripheral signs and symptoms, in PWID.

The incidence in the United States is between 3% and 6%. The cardinal feature of PFPS is pain in or around the anterior knee that intensifies when the knee is flexed during weight-bearing activities. The pain of PFPS often worsens with prolonged sitting or descending stairs. The most sensitive physical examination finding is pain with squatting. Examining a patient's gait, posture, and footwear can help identify contributing causes. Plain radiographs of the knee are not necessary for the diagnosis of PFPS but can exclude other diagnoses, such as osteoarthritis, patellar fracture, and osteochondritis. If conservative treatment measures are unsuccessful, plain radiography is recommended. Treatment of PFPS includes rest, a short course of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and physical therapy directed at strengthening the hip flexor, trunk, and knee muscle groups. Patellar kinesiotaping may provide additional short-term pain relief; however, evidence is insufficient to support its routine use. Surgery is considered a last resort.",Neuropsychological Evaluations in Adults.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30633479,American family physician,2019 01 11,"Neuropsychologists provide detailed assessments of cognitive and emotional functioning that often cannot be obtained through other diagnostic means. They use standardized assessment tools and integrate the findings with other data to determine whether cognitive decline has occurred, to differentiate neurologic from psychiatric conditions, to identify neurocognitive etiologies, and to determine the relationship between neurologic factors and difficulties in daily functioning. Family physicians should consider referring patients when there are questions about diagnostic decision making or planning of individualized management strategies for patients with mild cognitive impairment, dementia, traumatic brain injury, and other clinical conditions that affect cognitive functioning. Neuropsychological testing can differentiate Alzheimer dementia from nondementia with nearly 90% accuracy. The addition of neuropsychological testing to injury severity variables (e.g., posttraumatic amnesia) increases predicted accuracy in functional outcomes. A neuropsychological evaluation can be helpful in addressing concerns about functional capacities (e.g., ability to drive or live independently) and in determining a patient's capacity to make decisions about health care or finances. Most patients who underwent neuropsychological evaluation and their significant others reported that they found the evaluation helpful in understanding and coping with cognitive problems."

The developed strategy allows retention of the overall morphology of Y-ZnO compared with pristine ZnO and the extent of oxygen vacancies can be tuned. The influence of oxygen deficiencies, the extent of defect sites, and the morphology of ZnO on its solution-phase thermocatalytic activity has been evaluated in the synthesis of 5-substituted-1H-tetrazoles with different nitriles and sodium azide. A reasonable enhancement in the reaction rate was achieved by using Y-ZnO nanoflakes (Y-ZnO NFs) as a catalyst in place of pristine ZnO NFs. The reaction was complete within 6 h at 110 °C with Y-ZnO NFs, whereas it took 14 h at 120 °C with pristine ZnO NFs.

Creating Pd-based nanoarchitectures with increased active surface sites, higher density of low-coordinated atoms, and maximized surface coverage for the reactants is important. To address the limitations of pure Pd, various Pd-based nanoarchitectures, including alloys, intermetallics, and supported Pd nanomaterials, have been fabricated by combining Pd with other elements with similar or higher catalytic activity for many catalytic reactions. Herein, recent advances in the preparation of Pd-based nanoarchitectures through solution-phase chemical reduction and electrochemical deposition methods are summarized.

These enzymes are reciprocally regulated by interaction with the PII proteins, GlnB and GlnZ. In this study, purified ADP-ribosylated Fe-protein was used as substrate to study the mechanism involved in the regulation of A. brasilense DraG in vitro. The data show that DraG is partially inhibited by GlnZ and that DraG inhibition is further enhanced by the simultaneous presence of GlnZ and AmtB. These results are the first to demonstrate experimentally that DraG inactivation requires the formation of a ternary DraG-GlnZ-AmtB complex in vitro. Previous structural data have revealed that when the DraG-GlnZ complex associates with AmtB, the flexible T-loops of the trimeric GlnZ bind to AmtB and become rigid; these molecular events stabilize the DraG-GlnZ complex, resulting in DraG inactivation. To determine whether restraining the flexibility of the GlnZ T-loops is a limiting factor in DraG inhibition, we used a GlnZ variant that carries a partial deletion of the T-loop (GlnZΔ42-54). However, although the GlnZΔ42-54 variant was more effective in inhibiting DraG in vitro, it bound to DraG with a slightly lower affinity than does wild-type GlnZ and was not competent to completely inhibit DraG activity either in vitro or in vivo. We, therefore, conclude that the formation of a ternary complex between DraG-GlnZ-AmtB is necessary for the inactivation of DraG.",Foliar epidermal anatomy of Lamiaceae with special emphasis on their trichomes diversity using scanning electron microscopy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30633436,Microscopy research and technique,2019 04 03,"Foliar epidermal features were based on the micromorphology of trichomes types, epidermal cells and stomatal complex. Even though each feature has its own limited taxonomic value but collectively these characteristics may be systematically important especially for the discrimination and identification of complex and problematic taxa. The systematics significance of nonglandular (NGTs) and glandular trichomes (GTs), stomatal complex and epidermal cells of Lamiaceous flora were analyzed by using the light microscopy (LM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Variations on the observed epidermal appendages were divided into two basic types: glandular and nonglandular. GTs can be divided into subtypes: sessile capitate, subsessile capitate, and barrel and sunken. NGTs were also divided into subtypes: dendritic, stellate, conical, falcate, simple and 1-6 cells long having granulate and smooth surface ornamentation. NGTs were the most dominant features of both adaxial and abaxial surfaces of all observed taxa. Vitex negundo, Isodon rugosus, Colebrookea oppositifolia, and Marrubium vulgare could be demarked because of their twisted like appearance of NGTs at the abaxial surface. The Lamiaceae had both hypostomatic and amphistomatic leaf. Stomata were observed as diacytic, anisocytic, and anomocytic. Epidermal cells were found to be irregular, isodiametric, and rectangular. Based on these characters a taxonomic key was developed to delimit the closely related taxa. Distribution and morphology of the foliar epidermal trichomes through SEM highlight an important taxonomic tool used by the taxonomists as an aid to the correct identification of problematic Lamiaceae taxa.",Early onset oral tongue squamous cell carcinoma: Associated factors and patient outcomes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30633435,Head & neck,2019 05 22,Incidence of oral tongue squamous cell carcinoma (OTC) is rising among those under age 50 years.

With two cameras fitted on its imaging planes, a microscopic binocular vision system can be constructed, and this system can be applied in three-dimensional (3D) shape measurements of a microscopic object. A novel-shape reconstruction system is developed in this article composed of laser fringe scanning and a stereo light microscope. A laser projector emits a thin light sheet and projects it onto the microscopic object's surface. The microscopic object is placed on a micro-displacement mechanism and moved in a given direction. The entire surface of the object is scanned by the light sheet. This system captures a series of microscopic images of the laser stripe, which are used to restore the 3D shape of the object. In this article, we mainly focus on the study of the laser stripe detection method, which is derived based on the Canny rule. First, the Canny rule outputs pixels at the left and right edges of the laser stripe. Then, a subpixel edge extraction method is proposed based on polynomial fitting that outputs the center curve of the laser stripe. Finally, an edge filter is used to smooth the edge burrs, and the Hermite interpolation method is used to link the broken edges and construct continuous, smoothing edge contours. The results show that this method can effectively find the subpixel position of the laser stripe and output high-quality edge contours. The method is suitable for extracting the contours of a laser stripe located in a microscope image.",Nanocontainers for analytical applications.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30633433,Angewandte Chemie (International ed. in English),2019 01 11,"Nanocontainers such as mesoporous silica particles and polymersomes are versatile structures containing holes or pores used for the entrapment of small molecules and the introduction of specific functionalities.

Conventionally, isotope effects derive from differences of isotopically substituted molecules in isotope vibrational energy, bond strength, velocity, gravity, and evaporation/condensation. The variations in isotope ratio, such as 18 O/16 O (δ18 O) and 17 O/16 O (δ17 O) are dependent upon mass differences with δ17 O/δ18 O=0.5, due to the relative mass differences (1 amu vs. 2 amu). Relations that do not follow this are termed mass independent and are the focus of this Minireview. In chemical reactions such as ozone formation, a δ17 O/δ18 O=1 is observed. Physical chemical models capture most parameters but differ in basic approach and are reviewed.

At the molecular level, epigenetic functions result partly from modification of the nucleobases in DNA and RNA, and/or post-translational modifications (PTMs) of histone proteins. Much evidence has emerged to demonstrate that these modifications are dynamic, with cellular machinery identified to modulate and interpret the marks. Our focus is on bromodomains that bind to acetylated lysine (KAc) residues. Progress in the study of bromodomains, and the development of bromodomain ligands, has been rapid. These advances have been underpinned by many disciplines, but chemistry and chemical biology techniques have undoubtedly played a very significant role. Here we review the key chemistry and chemical biology techniques and approaches that have furthered our study of bromodomains, enabled the development of bromodomain ligands, and played a critical role in the validation of bromodomains as therapeutic targets."

However, in nature, bacteria interact with plants in multitaxa consortia, systems which remain poorly understood. Previously, we demonstrated that a consortium of five native bacterial isolates protected their host plant Nicotiana attenuata from a sudden wilt disease. Here we explore the mechanisms behind the protection effect against the native pathosystem. Three members of the consortium, Pseudomonas azotoformans A70, P. frederiksbergensis A176 and Arthrobacter nitroguajacolicus E46, form biofilms when grown individually in vitro, and the amount of biofilm increased synergistically in the five-membered consortium, including two Bacillus species, B. megaterium and B. mojavensis. Fluorescence in situ hybridization and scanning electron microscopy in planta imaging techniques confirmed biofilm formation and revealed locally distinct distributions of the five bacterial strains colonizing different areas on the plant-root surface. One of the five isolates, K1 B. mojavensis produces the antifungal compound surfactin, under in vitro and in vivo conditions, clearly inhibiting fungal growth. Furthermore, isolates A70 and A176 produce siderophores under in vitro conditions. Based on these results we infer that the consortium of five bacterial isolates protects its host against fungal phytopathogens via complementary traits.

It has been suggested that the interaction of aquaporin-4 (AQP4) and the transient receptor potential vaniloid isoform 4 (TRPV4) channels play a role in water balance and cell volume regulation, and indirectly, of the ECS volume. Using the real-time iontophoretic method, we studied the changes of the ECS diffusion parameters: ECS volume fraction α (α = ECS volume fraction/total tissue volume) and tortuosity λ (λ2  = free/apparent diffusion coefficient) in mice with a genetic deficiency of AQP4 or TRPV4 channels, and in control animals. The used models of cytotoxic edema included: mild and severe hypotonic stress or oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) in situ and terminal ischemia/anoxia in vivo. This study shows that an AQP4 or TRPV4 deficit slows down the ECS volume shrinkage during severe ischemia in vivo. We further demonstrate that a TRPV4 deficit slows down the velocity and attenuates an extent of the ECS volume decrease during OGD treatment in situ. However, in any of the cytotoxic edema models in situ (OGD, mild or severe hypotonic stress), we did not detect any alterations in the cell swelling or volume regulation caused by AQP4 deficiency. Overall, our results indicate that the AQP4 and TRPV4 channels may play a crucial role in severe pathological states associated with their overexpression and enhanced cell swelling. However, detailed interplay between AQP4 and TRPV4 channels requires further studies and additional research.",Impact of extent of parotidectomy on early and long-term complications: A prospective multicenter cohort trial.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30633414,Head & neck,2019 05 22,"In this prospective nonrandomized multicenter trial, we analyze the incidence of early and late complications after parotidectomy in correlation to the extent of dissection.",Encoding of kinetic and kinematic movement parameters in the sensorimotor cortex: A Brain-Computer Interface perspective.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30633413,The European journal of neuroscience,2019 03 11,"For severely paralyzed people, Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) can potentially replace lost motor output and provide a brain-based control signal for augmentative and alternative communication devices or neuroprosthetics. Many BCIs focus on neuronal signals acquired from the hand area of the sensorimotor cortex, employing changes in the patterns of neuronal firing or spectral power associated with one or more types of hand movement. Hand and finger movement can be described by two groups of movement features, namely kinematics (spatial and motion aspects) and kinetics (muscles and forces). Despite extensive primate and human research, it is not fully understood how these features are represented in the SMC and how they lead to the appropriate movement. Yet, the available information may provide insight into which features are most suitable for BCI control. To that purpose, the current paper provides an in-depth review on the movement features encoded in the SMC. Even though there is no consensus on how exactly the SMC generates movement, we conclude that some parameters are well represented in the SMC and can be accurately used for BCI control with discrete as well as continuous feedback. However, the vast evidence also suggests that movement should be interpreted as a combination of multiple parameters rather than isolated ones, pleading for further exploration of sensorimotor control models for accurate BCI control.",Importance of tumor budding grade as independent prognostic factor for early tongue squamous cell carcinoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30633412,Head & neck,2019 05 22,Factors involved in neck lymph node metastasis (NLM) and prognosis of early tongue squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) remain unknown.,Disentangling structural genomic and behavioural barriers in a sea of connectivity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30633410,Molecular ecology,2019 06 09,"Genetic divergence among populations arises through natural selection or drift and is counteracted by connectivity and gene flow. In sympatric populations, isolating mechanisms are thus needed to limit the homogenizing effects of gene flow to allow for adaptation and speciation. Chromosomal inversions act as an important mechanism maintaining isolating barriers, yet their role in sympatric populations and divergence with gene flow is not entirely understood. Here, we revisit the question of whether inversions play a role in the divergence of connected populations of the marine fish Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua), by exploring a unique data set combining whole-genome sequencing data and behavioural data obtained with acoustic telemetry. Within a confined fjord environment, we find three genetically differentiated Atlantic cod types belonging to the oceanic North Sea population, the western Baltic population and a local fjord-type cod. Continuous behavioural tracking over 4 year revealed temporally stable sympatry of these types within the fjord. Despite overall weak genetic differentiation consistent with high levels of gene flow, we detected significant frequency shifts of three previously identified inversions, indicating an adaptive barrier to gene flow. In addition, behavioural data indicated that North Sea cod and individuals homozygous for the LG12 inversion had lower fitness in the fjord environment. However, North Sea and fjord-type cod also occupy different depths, possibly contributing to prezygotic reproductive isolation and representing a behavioural barrier to gene flow. Our results provide the first insights into a complex interplay of genomic and behavioural isolating barriers in Atlantic cod and establish a new model system towards an understanding of the role of genomic structural variants in adaptation and diversification.","Preoperative neutrophil lymphocyte ratio but not platelet lymphocyte ratio predicts survival and early relapse in patients with oral, pharyngeal, and lip cancer.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30633409,Head & neck,2019 04 16,"To evaluate the prognostic value of preoperative neutrophil lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and platelet lymphocyte ratio (PLR) in oral, pharyngeal, and lip cancer for survival and relapse.",Speciation in protists: Spatial and ecological divergence processes cause rapid species diversification in a freshwater chrysophyte.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30633408,Molecular ecology,2019 06 09,"Although eukaryotic microorganisms are extremely numerous, diverse and essential to global ecosystem functioning, they are largely understudied by evolutionary biologists compared to multicellular macroscopic organisms. In particular, very little is known about the speciation mechanisms which may give rise to the diversity of microscopic eukaryotes. It was postulated that the enormous population sizes and ubiquitous distribution of these organisms could lead to a lack of population differentiation and therefore very low speciation rates. However, such assumptions have traditionally been based on morphospecies, which may not accurately reflect the true diversity, missing cryptic taxa. In this study, we aim to articulate the major diversification mechanisms leading to the contemporary molecular diversity by using a colonial freshwater flagellate, Synura sphagnicola, as an example. Phylogenetic analysis of five sequenced loci showed that S. sphagnicola differentiated into two morphologically distinct lineages approximately 15.4 million years ago, which further diverged into several evolutionarily recent haplotypes during the late Pleistocene. The most recent haplotypes are ecologically and biogeographically much more differentiated than the old lineages, presumably because of their persistent differentiation after the allopatric speciation events. Our study shows that in microbial eukaryotes, species diversification via the colonization of new geographical regions or ecological resources occurs much more readily than was previously thought. Consequently, divergence times of microorganisms in some lineages may be equivalent to the estimated times of speciation in plants and animals."

Here, the successfully synthesis of two isostructural 2D SCAMs is reported: Ag12 bpa and Ag12 bpe are formed by using two linkers with different conformational freedom (bpa=1,2-bis(4-pyridyl)ethane, bpe=1,2-bis(4-pyridyl)ethylene), with dodenuclear silver chalcogenolate clusters as secondary building units (SBUs). Interestingly, nonluminescent Ag12 bpa at room temperature could quickly transform into 1D Ag10 bpa, with concomitant dissociation of two silver atoms and the remaining ten silver atoms rearranging in the cluster, thus exhibiting an intense yellow phosphorescence after being triggered by acetonitrile (CH3 CN). Similarly, stimulating Ag12 bpe with CH3 CN, by contrast, gave another 2D structure Ag12 bpe-1b with the distorted SBUs and different topology structure, and both of them are merely red-emissive at low temperature. To note, after exchanging ligands, room-temperature nonluminescent 2D Ag12 bpe-1b can be transformed into intensely luminescent 1D Ag10 bpa. This linker-flexibility-dependent structural transformation and cluster-based SBU controlled luminescence remains scarce.

Gene transfection to make NSCs overexpress brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) can enhance their therapeutic efficacy; however, viral vectors must be used because current nonviral vectors are unable to efficiently transfect NSCs. The first polymeric vector, ROS-responsive charge-reversal poly[(2-acryloyl)ethyl(p-boronic acid benzyl)diethylammonium bromide] (B-PDEA), is shown here, that mediates efficient gene transfection of NSCs and greatly enhances their therapeutics in ischemic stroke treatment. The cationic B-PDEA/DNA polyplexes can effectively transfect NSCs; in the cytosol, the B-PDEA is oxidized by intracellular ROS into negatively charged polyacrylic acid, quickly releasing the BDNF plasmids for efficient transcription and secreting a high level of BDNF. After i.v. injection in ischemic stroke mice, the transfected NSCs (BDNF-NSCs) can home to ischemic regions as efficiently as the pristine NSCs but more efficiently produce BDNF, leading to significantly augmented BDNF levels, which in turn enhances the mouse survival rate to 60%, from 0% (nontreated mice) or ≈20% (NSC-treated mice), and enables more rapid and superior functional reconstruction.",Super Moisture-Absorbent Gels for All-Weather Atmospheric Water Harvesting.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30633394,"Advanced materials (Deerfield Beach, Fla.)",2019 03 06,"Atmospheric water harvesting (AWH)-producing fresh water via collecting moisture from air-enables sustainable water delivery without geographical and hydrologic limitations.

Based on such design, a high-efficiency water production by AWH has been achieved in a broad range of relative humidity. The synergistic effect enabled by the molecular level integration of hygroscopic and hydrophilicity-switchable polymers in a network architecture presents controllable interaction between the gel and water molecules, simultaneously realizing efficient vapor capturing, in situ water liquefaction, high-density water storage and fast water releasing under different weather conditions.

HU and Lsr2 are two principal NAPs in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). HU is essential for Mtb survival and is one of the most abundant NAPs. It differs from other eubacterial HU proteins in having a long, flexible lysine- and arginine-rich carboxy-terminal domain. Lsr2 of Mtb is the functional analogue of the bacterial NAP commonly called H-NS. Lsr2 binds to and regulates expression of A/T-rich portions of the otherwise G/C-rich mycobacterial chromosome. Here, we demonstrate that HU and Lsr2 interact to form a complex. The interaction occurs primarily through the flexible carboxy-terminal domain of HU and the acidic amino-terminal domain of Lsr2. The resulting complex, upon binding to DNA, forms thick nucleoprotein rods, in contrast to the DNA bridging seen with Lsr2 and the DNA compaction seen with HU. Furthermore, transcription assays indicate that the HU-Lsr2 complex is a regulator of gene expression. This physical and functional interaction between two NAPs, which has not been reported previously, is likely to be important for DNA organization and gene expression in Mtb and perhaps other bacterial species.",Improved power of familywise error rate procedures for discrete data under dependency.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30633390,Biometrical journal.

In such cases, it is important for multiplicity adjustment to take into account the discreteness of the distributions of the p-values, to assure that the procedure is not overly conservative. In this paper, we review some known multiple testing procedures for discrete data that control the familywise error rate, the probability of making any false rejection. Taking advantage of the fact that the exact permutation or exact pairwise permutation distributions of the p-values can often be determined when the sample size is small, we investigate procedures that incorporate the dependence structure through the exact permutation distribution and propose two new procedures that incorporate the exact pairwise permutation distributions. A step-up procedure is also proposed that accounts for the discreteness of the data. The performance of the proposed procedures is investigated through simulation studies and two applications. The results show that by incorporating both discreteness and dependency of p-value distributions, gains in power can be achieved.",Cancer metabolism in a snapshot: MRS(I).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30633389,NMR in biomedicine,2019 01 11,"The contribution of MRS(I) to the in vivo evaluation of cancer-metabolism-derived metrics, mostly since 2016, is reviewed here. Increased carbon consumption by tumour cells, which are highly glycolytic, is now being sampled by 13 C magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) following the injection of hyperpolarized [1-13 C] pyruvate (Pyr). Hot-spots of, mostly, increased lactate dehydrogenase activity or flow between Pyr and lactate (Lac) have been seen with cancer progression in prostate (preclinical and in humans), brain and pancreas (both preclinical) tumours. Therapy response is usually signalled by decreased Lac/Pyr 13 C-labelled ratio with respect to untreated or non-responding tumour. For therapeutic agents inducing tumour hypoxia, the 13 C-labelled Lac/bicarbonate ratio may be a better metric than the Lac/Pyr ratio. 31 P MRSI may sample intracellular pH changes from brain tumours (acidification upon antiangiogenic treatment, basification at fast proliferation and relapse). The steady state tumour metabolome pattern is still in use for cancer evaluation. Metrics used for this range from quantification of single oncometabolites (such as 2-hydroxyglutarate in mutant IDH1 glial brain tumours) to selected metabolite ratios (such as total choline to N-acetylaspartate (plain ratio or CNI index)) or the whole 1 H MRSI(I) pattern through pattern recognition analysis. These approaches have been applied to address different questions such as tumour subtype definition, following/predicting the response to therapy or defining better resection or radiosurgery limits.",Enantiomeric separation of prothioconazole and prothioconazole-desthio on chiral stationary phases.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30633388,Chirality,2019 05 22,"Prothioconazole is a type of broad-spectrum triazole thione fungicide developed by the Bayer Company.

In our study, enantiomeric separation of prothioconazole and prothioconazole-desthio was performed on various chiral stationary phases (CSPs) by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). It was found that polysaccharide CSPs showed better ability than brushing CSPs in enantiomeric separation. The successful chiral separation of prothioconazole could be achieved on self-made Chiralcel OD, commercialized Chiralcel OJ-H and Lux Cellulose-1. Chiralpak IA, Chiralpak IB, Chiralpak IC, Chiralcel OD, Chiralpak AY-H, Chiralpak AZ-H, and Lux Cellulose-1 realized the baseline separation of prothioconazole-desthio enantiomers. Simultaneous enantiomeric separation of prothioconazole and prothioconazole-desthio was performed on Lux Cellulose-1 using acetonitrile (ACN) and water as mobile phase. In most cases, low temperature favored the separation of two compounds. The influence of the mobile phase ratio or type was deeply discussed. We obtained larger Rs and longer analysis time with a smaller proportion of isopropanol (IPA) or ethanol and more water content at the same temperature. The ratio of ACN and water had influences on the outflow orders of prothioconazole-desthio enantiomers.

This route is based on the reaction at 200 °C of titanium(IV) isopropoxide with acetic anhydride, in the absence of a catalyst or solvent. NMR spectroscopic studies indicate that this method provides an efficient, truly non-hydrolytic and aprotic route to TiO2 . Formation of the oxide involves successive acetoxylation and condensation reactions, both with ester elimination. The resulting TiO2 materials were nanocrystalline, even before calcination. Small (about 10 nm) anatase nanocrystals spontaneously aggregated to form mesoporous micron-sized particles with high specific surface area (240 m2  g-1 before calcination). Evaluation of the lithium storage performances shows a high reversible specific capacity, particularly for the non-calcined sample with the highest specific surface area favouring pseudo-capacitive storage: 253 mAh g-1 at 0.1 C and 218 mAh g-1 at 1 C (C=336 mA g-1 ). This sample also shows good cyclability (92 % retention after 200 cycles at 336 mA g-1 ) with a high coulombic efficiency (99.8 %).

The results show that students perceived informative teachers' support as the most available. Prevalent somatic symptoms reported by students were those connected with tiredness, distraction, low energy and pain. Teachers' evaluation was positively linked to academic motivation. High level of perceived (1) emotional, (2) informational teachers support and a (3) high 'mark' prescribed by student to the teacher via teachers' evaluation were negatively related to somatic symptoms.

The objective of this study was to assess the pharmacokinetics and safety of a single upadacitinib dose in subjects with normal renal function and in subjects with renal impairment. A total of 24 subjects between the ages of 18 and 75 years were assigned to 1 of 4 renal function groups based on estimated glomerular filtration rate (normal, mild, moderate, severe; N = 6/group). A single 15-mg dose of upadacitinib extended-release formulation was administered under fasting conditions. Serial plasma and urine samples were assayed to evaluate the effect of renal impairment on upadacitinib exposure through regression analysis and analysis of covariance. The primary analysis was the regression analysis of upadacitinib exposures versus estimated glomerular filtration rate. The point estimates for upadacitinib plasma exposure ratios (90% confidence interval [CI]) in subjects with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment were 1.18 (90%CI, 1.06-1.32), 1.33 (90%CI, 1.11-1.59), and 1.44 (90%CI, 1.14-1.82) for area under the plasma concentration-time curve and 1.06 (90%CI, 0.92-1.23), 1.11 (90%CI, 0.88-1.40), and 1.14 (90%CI, 0.84-1.56) for maximum observed plasma concentration, respectively, relative to subjects with normal renal function based on the regression analysis. The analysis of covariance categorical analysis provided consistent results. Upadacitinib was well tolerated by all subjects, and no safety issues were identified in subjects with renal impairment. Renal impairment has a limited effect on upadacitinib pharmacokinetics. This is in agreement with the known limited role of urinary excretion in upadacitinib elimination. Based on the limited impact on exposure, no dose adjustment is necessary for upadacitinib in subjects with impaired renal function.",Use of Physiologically Based Pharmacokinetic Modeling to Identify Physiological and Molecular Characteristics Driving Variability in Axitinib Exposure: A Fresh Approach to Precision Dosing in Oncology.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30633368,Journal of clinical pharmacology,2019 05 03,"Axitinib is a second-generation small-molecule vascular endothelial growth factor receptor inhibitor.

This study sought to characterize the physiological and molecular characteristics driving variability in axitinib AUCSS using physiologically based pharmacokinetic modeling to identify exposure biomarkers for this drug. The capacity to predict subjects likely to fail to achieve an axitinib AUCSS >300 ng/mL/hr was evaluated as a secondary outcome. A full physiologically based pharmacokinetic model incorporating mechanistic absorption was developed and verified for axitinib in accordance with the US Food and Drug Administration Guidance using Simcyp (Version 17.1). This model was used to simulate axitinib exposure over 7 days with twice-daily dosing (5 mg) in a cohort of 1000 virtual cancer patients. Multiple linear regression modeling was used to identify patient characteristics associated with differences in axitinib exposure. A multivariable linear regression model incorporating hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 abundance, albumin concentration, hepatic CYP1A2 abundance, hepatic CYP2C19 abundance, and intestinal CYP2C19 abundance provided robust prediction of axitinib AUCSS (R2 = 0.890; P < .001). By accounting for these variables, it was possible to identify subjects who would fail to achieve an effective axitinib AUCSS with a specificity of 88.7% and a sensitivity of 92.6%. Variability in axitinib AUCSS is primarily driven by differences in hepatic CYP3A4 abundance and albumin concentration. Consideration of these 2 characteristic is likely to be sufficient to individualize axitinib dosing.",How is mechanobiology involved in mesenchymal stem cell differentiation toward the osteoblastic or adipogenic fate?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30633367,Journal of cellular physiology,2019 04 23,"Mechanobiology plays a major role in transducing physical cues from the dynamic cellular environment into biochemical modifications that promote cell-specific differentiation paths. Mesenchymal stem cells in the bone marrow or in other mesenchymal tissues will differentiate according to the expression of transcription factors (TFs) that govern their lineage commitment. The favoring of either osteogenic or adipogenic differentiation relies on TF expression as well as mechanical properties of the cells' niche that are translated into the activation of certain signaling pathways. Physical factors can induce significant shifts in bipotential lineage commitment between osteogenesis and adipogenesis. The stiffness of the extracellular matrix (ECM) surrounding a cell, varying greatly from rigid environments close to the bone surface to softer regions in the bone marrow, can influence the path of differentiation. Additionally, mechanical loading through exercise appears to favor osteogenesis whereas disuse conditions seem to promote adipogenesis.",The Cardiovascular Effects of a Meal: J-Tpeak and Tpeak -Tend Assessment and Further Insights Into the Physiological Effects.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30633366,Journal of clinical pharmacology,2019 05 03,"Meal intake leads to a significant and prolonged increase in cardiac output to supply the splanchnic vasculature. A meal is associated with sympathetic activation of the cardiovascular system, and food ingestion is correlated with an increase in heart rate, an increase in cardiac stroke volume, and QTc interval shortening for up to 7 hours. Given the complexity of the system, one or several of many mechanisms could explain this observation. The shortening of the QTc interval was correlated with a rise of C-peptide following food ingestion, but the mechanisms by which C-peptide may be involved in the modulation of cardiac repolarization are still unknown. This shortening of the myocardial action potential caused by the ingestion of food was further investigated in the present study by measuring the QRS, J-Tpeak , and Tpeak -Tend intervals in search of further clues to better understand the underlying mechanisms. A retrospective analysis was conducted based on data collected in a formal thorough QT/QTc study in which 32 subjects received a carbohydrate-rich ""continental"" breakfast, moxifloxacin without food, and moxifloxacin with food. We assessed the effect of food on T-wave morphology using validated algorithms for measurement of J-Tpeak and Tpeak -Tend intervals. Our findings demonstrate that a standardized meal significantly shortened J-Tpeak for 4 hours after a meal and to a much lesser extent and shorter duration (up to 1 hour) prolonged the Tpeak -Tend and QRS intervals. This suggests that the QTc shortening occurs mainly during phase 2 of the cardiac action potential. As there was no corresponding effect on Tpeak -Tend beyond the first hour, we conclude that a meal does not interfere with the outward correcting potassium channels but possibly with Ca2+ currents. An effect on mainly Ca2+ aligns well with our understanding of physiology whereby an increase in stroke volume, as observed after a meal, is associated with changes in Ca2+ cycling in and out of the sarcoplasmic reticulum during cardiac myocyte contraction.",Pharmacokinetic Evaluation of Nimotuzumab in Patients With Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30633365,Journal of clinical pharmacology,2019 05 03,"Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is a genetic disease characterized by an overexpression and mislocalization of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) to the apical membranes of cystic epithelial cells.

The aim of this study was to assess the pharmacokinetic behavior of nimotuzumab in patients with ADPKD given as a single dose.

For the first time, nimotuzumab was used for treating a nononcological disease. The administration of nimotuzumab showed dose-dependent kinetics. Nimotuzumab does not develop anti-idiotypic response against the murine portion present in the hypervariable region of the antibody present in the serum of the patients treated.

In the present study, we showed that hsa_circRNA_101996 was highly expressed in cervical cancer tissues compared with matched normal tissues by bioinformatics analysis. We showed that the expression level of hsa_circRNA_101996 in cervical cancer tissues was positively correlated with TNM stage, tumor size, and lymph node metastasis. Moreover, higher levels of hsa_circRNA_101996 were related to poor outcomes of cervical cancer patients. We found that knockdown of hsa_circRNA_101996 significantly inhibited the proliferation, cell cycle, migration, and invasion of cervical cancer cells. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that hsa_circRNA_101996 served as a sponge of miR-8075, which targeted TPX2 in cervical cancer cells. We showed that miR-8075 that was downregulated in cervical cancer tissues repressed cervical cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Furthermore, we validated that upregulation of TPX2 by hsa_circRNA_101996-mediated inhibition of miR-8075 contributed to cervical cancer proliferation, migration, and invasion. Taken together, our findings revealed a novel mechanism that hsa_circRNA_101996-miR-8075-TPX2 network promoted cervical cancer progression.",Biochemically confirmed smoking cessation and gestational weight gain.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30633363,"Birth (Berkeley, Calif.)",2019 05 18,"Prenatal smoking cessation has substantial health benefits for mothers and offspring, but concerns about weight gain may be a barrier to quitting.

This occurs by sequentially activating anabolic immune effector mechanisms, switching to immune deactivation mechanisms and then restoring immunometabolic homeostasis. Nuclear sirtuin 1 and mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase metabolically drive this dynamic and are druggable targets that promote immunometabolic resolution in septic mice and increase survival. We used unbiased metabolomics and a validated monocyte culture model of activation, deactivation, and partial resolution of acute inflammation to sequentially track metabolic rewiring. Increases in glycogenolysis, hexosamine, glycolysis, and pentose phosphate pathways were aligned with anabolic activation. Activation transitioned to combined lipid, protein, amino acid, and nucleotide catabolism during deactivation, and partially subsided during early resolution. Lipid metabolic rewiring signatures aligned with deactivation included elevated n-3 and n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids and increased levels of fatty acid acylcarnitines. Increased methionine to homocysteine cycling increased levels of s-adenosylmethionine rate-limiting transmethylation mediator, and homocysteine and cysteine transsulfuration preceded increases in glutathione. Increased tryptophan catabolism led to elevated kynurenine and de novo biosynthesis of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide from quinolinic acid. Increased branched-chain amino acid catabolism paralleled increases in succinyl-CoA. A rise in the Krebs cycle cis-aconitate-derived itaconate and succinate with decreased fumarate and acetyl-CoA levels occurred concomitant with deactivation and subsided during early resolution. The data suggest that rewiring of metabolic and mitochondrial bioenergetics by monocytes sequentially activates, deactivates, and resolves acute inflammation.",Nanovaccine: A novel approach in immunization.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30633361,Journal of cellular physiology,2019 04 23,"Despite great advances in the field of vaccination, there are still needs for novel and effective vaccines because still no effective vaccines have been produced for some diseases such as malaria, acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), and tuberculosis. Furthermore, many of the existing vaccines have disadvantages such as failure to stimulate completely the immune system, in vivo instability, high toxicity, the need for cold chain, and multiple administrations. Nanotechnology has been raised as a powerful tool for solving these problems in this regard. Generally, nanovaccines are a new generation of vaccines using nanoparticles (NPs) as carriers and/or adjuvants. Due to the similar scale (size) between the NPs and pathogens, the immune system can be stimulated well, resulting in triggered cellular and humoral immunity responses. Other benefits of the nanovaccines include their better stability in blood flow to increase the shelf life in blood, enhanced immune system stimulation, no need for booster doses, no need to maintain the cold chain, and ability to create active targeting. In addition, nanovaccines have raised the hope to treat diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, AIDS, malaria, and chronic autoimmune, and so forth."

Inflammation causes endothelial injury and dysfunction, which is an initial step of atherosclerosis. Fibrinopeptide A (FPA) is a biomarker of the activation of the coagulation system, and a high concentration of FPA in the blood occurs in patients with ischemic cardiocerebrovascular diseases. The present research observed that FPA stimulated the generation of C-reactive protein (CRP), IL-1β, and IL-6 in human umbilical vascular endothelial cells (HUVECs); and anti-IL-1 β and anti-IL-6 neutralizing antibodies did not alter FPA-induced CRP expression in HUVECs. The subchronic administration of FPA into rats increased the plasma FPA and CRP levels. Further studies showed that FPA stimulated superoxide anion generation, activated ERK1/2 and p38, promoted nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) nuclear translocation, and raised the NF-κB level in the nuclei of HUVECs. Antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC), complex II inhibitor thenoyltrifluoroacetone (TTFA), and NADPH oxidase inhibitor diphenyleneiodonium (DPI) inhibited FPA-stimulated generation of superoxide anion, and NAC reduced FPA-induced expressions of the phosphorylated ERK1/2 and p38. NAC, TTFA, DPI, inhibitors of ERK1/2, p38, and NF-κB all downregulated FPA-induced CRP expression. These results indicate that FPA induces CRP expression in HUVECs via the ROS-ERK1/2/p38-NF-κB signal pathway. Moreover, this is the first report that FPA produces a proinflammatory effect on the vascular endothelial cells.",Identification of molecular marker associated with ovarian cancer prognosis using bioinformatics analysis and experiments.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30633343,Journal of cellular physiology,2019 03 20,"Ovarian cancer is one of the three major malignant tumors of the female reproductive system, and the mortality associated with ovarian cancer ranks first among gynecologic malignant tumors. The pathogenesis of ovarian cancer is not yet clearly defined but elucidating this process would be of great significance for clinical diagnosis, prevention, and treatment. For this study, we used bioinformatics to identify the key pathogenic genes and reveal the potential molecular mechanisms of ovarian cancer; we used immunohistochemistry to validate them.",Fetal phenotype of Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome caused by CREBBP mutations.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30633342,Clinical genetics,2019 02 18,"Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome (RSTS; OMIM 180849) is an autosomal dominant developmental disorder characterized by facial dysmorphism, broad thumbs and halluces associated with intellectual disability. RSTS is caused by alterations in CREBBP (about 60%) and EP300 genes (8%). RSTS is often diagnosed at birth or during early childhood but generally not suspected during antenatal period. We report nine cases of well-documented fetal RSTS. Two cases were examined after death in utero at 18 and 35 weeks of gestation and seven cases after identification of ultrasound abnormalities and termination of pregnancy. On prenatal sonography, a large gallbladder was detected in two cases, and brain malformations were noted in four cases, especially cerebellar hypoplasia. However, the diagnosis of RSTS has not been suggested during pregnancy. Fetal autopsy showed that all fetuses had large thumbs and/or suggestive facial dysmorphism. A CREBBP gene anomaly was identified in all cases. Alterations were similar to those found in typical RSTS children. This report will contribute to a better knowledge of the fetal phenotype to consider the hypothesis of RSTS during pregnancy.

Its overexpression has been found in multiple cancer types and contributes to cancer development. Here we report the role of SRPK1 and underlying mechanism in gastric cancer (GC) cell growth. We found that SRPK1 was frequently upregulated in GC samples compared with their adjacent corresponding normal tissues by immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis. Knockdown of SRPK1 in GC cells suppressed cell growth in cell viability assays, colony formation assays and nude mice xenograft model, whereas overexpression of SRPK1 promotes opposite phenotypes in these assays. By a complementary DNA microarray analysis, we found that SRPK1 knockdown had significant inhibitory effects on a majority of small nucleolar RNAs expression. Among them, snoRA42, snoRA74A, and snoRD10 were selected for further functional experiments. Cell growth curves on a plate and in soft agar indicated that the three snoRNAs play potential oncogenic function in GC. In addition, SRPK1 could co-immunoprecipitated with NCL, a nucleolar phosphoprotein involved in the synthesis and maturation of ribosomes. These results suggested that SRPK1 contributes to GC development by a new possible mechanism involving snoRNAs mediated signaling.",Peptoids advance multidisciplinary research and undergraduate education in parallel: Sequence effects on conformation and lipid interactions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30633339,Biopolymers,2019 04 24,"Peptoids are versatile peptidomimetic molecules with wide-ranging applications from drug discovery to materials science. An understanding of peptoid sequence features that contribute to both their three-dimensional structures and their interactions with lipids will expand functions of peptoids in varied fields. Furthermore, these topics capture the enthusiasm of undergraduate students who prepare and study diverse peptoids in laboratory coursework and/or in faculty led research. Here, we present the synthesis and study of 21 peptoids with varied functionality, including 19 tripeptoids and 2 longer oligomers. We observed differences in fluorescence spectral features for 10 of the tripeptoids that correlated with peptoid flexibility and relative positioning of chromophores. Interactions of representative peptoids with sonicated glycerophospholipid vesicles were also evaluated using fluorescence spectroscopy. We observed evidence of conformational changes effected by lipids for select peptoids.

Limited O2 availability leads to increased levels of adenosine, which regulates the kidney via activation of both A1 and A2A adenosine receptors (A1R and A2AR, respectively). The relative contributions of A1R and A2AR to the regulation of renal Na+ transport and VO2 have not been determined. We demonstrated that A1R activation has a dose-dependent biphasic effect on both renal Na+ /H+ exchanger-3 (NHE3), a major player in Na+ transport, and VO2 . Here, we report concentration-dependent effects of adenosine: less than 5 × 10-7  M adenosine-stimulated NHE3 activity; between 5 × 10-7  M and 10-5  M adenosine-inhibited NHE3 activity; and greater than 10-5  M adenosine reversed the change in NHE3 activity (returned to baseline). A1R activation mediated the activation and inhibition of NHE3 activity, whereas 10-4  M adenosine had no effect on the NHE3 activity due to A2AR activation. The following occurred when A1R and A2AR were activated: (a) Blockade of the A2AR receptor restored the NHE3 inhibition mediated by A1R activation, (b) the NHE-dependent effect on VO2 mediated by A1R activation became NHE independent, and (c) A2AR bound to A1R. In summary, A1R affects VO2 via NHE-dependent mechanisms, whereas A2AR acts via NHE-independent mechanisms. When both A1R and A2AR are activated, the A2AR effect on NHE3 and VO2 predominates, possibly via an A1R-A2AR protein interaction. A2AR-A1R heterodimerization is proposed as the molecular mechanism enabling the NHE-independent control of renal VO2 .",Progressive resistance training to prevent arm lymphedema in the first year after breast cancer surgery: Results of a randomized controlled trial.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30633334,Cancer,2019 04 26,"Existing research suggests that progressive resistance training (PRT) after breast cancer (BC) surgery is safe, but the preventive effect on arm lymphedema has yet to be determined.",Efficient osteogenic differentiation of the dental pulp stem cells on β-glycerophosphate loaded polycaprolactone/polyethylene oxide blend nanofibers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30633333,Journal of cellular physiology,2019 04 23,"Hard tissue lesion treatment in oral and maxillofacial has been challenging because of tissue complexities. This study aimed to investigate novel biopolymeric construct effects on the osteogenic differentiation potential of the dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) for introducing a cell copolymer bioimplant. A blended polycaprolactone (PCL)-polyethylene oxide (PEO) was fabricated using electrospinning, simultaneously filled by β-glycerophosphate (β-GP). After that biocompatibility and release kinetics of the PCL-PEO+β-GP was evaluated and compared with PCL-PEO and then the osteogenic differentiation potential of the DPSCs was examined while being cultured on the scaffolds and compared with those cultured on the culture plate. The results demonstrated that scaffolds have not any cytotoxicity and β-GP can release in a long-term manner. Alkaline phosphatase activity and calcium content were significantly increased in DPSCs while being cultured on the PCL-PEO+β-GP compared with the other groups. Runt-related transcription factor 2, collagen type-I, osteonectin, and osteocalcin (OSC) genes expression was upregulated in DPSCs cultured on the PCL-PEO+β-GP and was significantly higher than those cultured on the PCL-PEO. Immunocytochemistry result also confirmed the positive effects of PCL-PEO+β-GP on the osteogenic differentiation of the DPSCs by presenting a higher OSC protein expression. According to the results, incorporation of the β-GP in PCL-PEO makes a better construct for osteogenic induction into the stem cells and it could be also considered as a great promising candidate for bone, oral, and maxillofacial tissue engineering applications.",H19 and Foxc2 synergistically promotes osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs via Wnt-β-catenin pathway.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30633332,Journal of cellular physiology,2019 04 23,To investigate the mechanism of H19 on the osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs).,The effects of a randomized trial of brief forms of stress management on RAGE-associated S100A8/A9 in patients with breast cancer undergoing primary treatment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30633331,Cancer,2019 04 30,"Women with breast cancer (BCa) experience heightened distress, which is related to greater inflammation and poorer outcomes.

The heterodimer s100A8/A9 RAGE ligand is associated with hastened tumor development and metastasis. Previously, a 10-week stress-management intervention using cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and relaxation training (RT) was associated with less leukocyte inflammatory gene expression in patients with BCa; however, its impact on s100A8/A9 was not examined. Because a 10-week intervention may be impractical during primary treatment for BCa, the authors developed briefer forms of CBT and RT and demonstrated their efficacy in reducing distress over 12 months of primary treatment. Here, the effects of these briefer interventions were tested effects on s100A8/A9 levels over the initial 12 months of BCa treatment."

In theory peer-review should ensure adequate reporting - in practice it does not. Many areas have developed reporting standards and checklists to support the adequate reporting of scientific efforts, but in vitro research still has no generally accepted criteria. It is characterized by a ""Wild West"" or ""anything goes"" attitude. Such a culture may undermine trust in the reproducibility of animal-free methods, and thus parallel the ""reproducibility crisis"" discussed for other life science fields. The increasing data retrieval needs of computational approaches (in extreme as ""big data"" and artificial intelligence) makes reporting quality even more important so that the scientific community can take full advantage of the results. The first priority of reporting standards is to ensure the completeness and transparency of information provided (data focus). The second tier is a quality of data display that makes information digestible and easy to grasp, compare and further analyze (information focus).

With centimeter-sized 3D specimens, the achieved response times were as short as 4 min (for 70% water release), in combination with very large volume responses (shrinking ratios up to 15). The response time can be tuned from minutes, over tens of minutes, up to hours. The pH-induced deswelling is always slower than the temperature-induced one, but at the highest starch content, ca. 5.5 min are needed for 70% completion of the pH-triggered process. Simultaneous temperature- and pH-stimuli expectedly also lead to very fast water release. The unique intercalated structure and the temperature-dependent hydrogen bridging between the intercalated phases, as well as between these phases and water, were found to play the key role in the ability of the gels to rapidly release water and shrink, which was deeper elucidated in this work.

The influence of measured skin pigmentation on UVB-induced 25(OH)D increase was investigated together with 9 demographic and 13 genetic parameters (pigment SNPs). Forty participants representing a wide range in measured skin pigmentation were exposed to identical UVB doses on identical body areas over nine weeks with weekly measurements of serum 25(OH)D. This study took place in Denmark during winter, a period with negligible ambient UVB, so variation in 25(OH)D synthesis was not influenced by latitude, season, sun and clothing habits. The increase in 25(OH)D concentration displayed considerable variation (range: 2.9 to 139 nmol L-1). Constitutive and facultative skin pigmentation exerted separate influence on the variation of the UVB-induced linear 25(OH)D increase. However, this influence was statistically non-significant in the presence of separate significant pigment SNPs. The variation in the 25(OH)D increase in the combined linear model was not explained by measured skin pigmentation but by sex, height, age and seven SNPs located in the ASIP, MTAP, MIR196A29 and Solute Carrier Family genes. This linear model including individual intercepts and the 10 parameters influencing the slope explained 77.4% of the variation. This study confirmed the influence of sex, age and height on 25(OH)D increase and found that pigment genes provided a better relation to UVB-induced 25(OH)D increase compared to the actual measured skin pigmentation. Therefore, only investigating skin pigmentation obscures other causal parameters for low 25(OH)D."

A transition from a predominantly indirect to direct reaction is found for Erel of 0.27-0.28 eV, a finding consistent with experiment. The simulation results corroborate the understanding that in experiments indirect reaction is characterized by small product translational energies and isotropic scattering, while direct reaction has higher translational energies and anisotropic scattering. The traditional statistical theoretical model for the Cl- + CH3I SN2 reaction assumes the Cl--CH3I pre-reaction complex (A) is formed, followed by barrier crossing, and then formation of the ClCH3-I- post-reaction complex (B).

The intensity and the handedness of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) were dependent on the ring size of the cyclic oligomers, in which the 1,1'-binaphthyl moieties form s-cis (n = 2, 3) or s-trans (n = 4, 5) conformers in the excited state. The relationship between the structure and chiroptical properties is discussed with the aid of X-ray analysis and DFT calculations.",Competition of singlet and triplet recombination of radical pairs in photoreactions of carboxy benzophenones and aromatic amino acids.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30633277,Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP,2019 01 23,"Time-resolved chemically induced dynamic nuclear polarization (CIDNP) and transient absorption (TA) were applied to reveal the branching ratio of the singlet and triplet recombination channels in the reaction of short-lived radicals of carboxy benzophenones and the aromatic amino acids histidine, tryptophan, and tyrosine in neutral aqueous solution. It was established that the share of triplet recombination increases with increasing number of carboxylic groups: no triplet recombination was found for 4-carboxy benzophenone, whereas ∼13% of radicals of 4,4'-dicarboxy benzophenone (DCBP) and ∼27% of radicals of 3,3',4,4'-tetracarboxy benzophenone (TCBP) react with histidine radicals from the triplet state of radical pairs. The main idea is that the protonated (π,π*) triplet state of TCBP or DCBP is populated via back electron transfer from the ketyl radical of TCBP or DCBP to the radical of the amino acid. The protonated triplet state of the ketone decays with the formation of a metastable hydroxylated product, which is detected by TA. Taking into account triplet recombination provides excellent coincidence between experimental data and the simulated CIDNP kinetics.",Swelling of clay minerals: dual characteristics of K+ ions and exploration of critical influencing factors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30633276,Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP,2019 01 23,"Clay swelling occurs frequently and is closely relevant to a number of engineering and industrial processes, while the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. In this study, K+-bearing clay systems with different charge amounts and charge locations have been simulated by molecular dynamics, showing that swelling is unfavorable for lower charge amounts (1.00 and 1.25 e uc-1) while it relies on charge locations for higher charge amounts (1.50 and 1.75 e uc-1): inhibited when tetrahedrally charged and favored when octahedrally charged. Accordingly, K+ shows dual characteristics and is not always a swelling inhibitor as generally thought. The various influencing factors are inspected and only the hydration effect interprets satisfactorily the swelling behaviors for all K+-bearing clay systems. The critical role of hydration effect during clay swelling is corroborated by the results of residence time, distribution of interlayer water and divergent swelling behaviors from Na+-bearing clay systems. Although water participates in a wide spectrum of physical and chemical processes, hydration is not necessarily among the most important influencing factors. Hydration effect has been evidenced as critical for clay swelling, and the results provide new insights into unraveling the complex swelling processes and resolving the associated engineering and industrial problems.",Vacuum-UV induced DNA strand breaks - influence of the radiosensitizers 5-bromouracil and 8-bromoadenine.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30633275,Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP,2019 01 23,"Radiation therapy is a basic part of cancer treatment. To increase the DNA damage in carcinogenic cells and preserve healthy tissue at the same time, radiosensitizing molecules such as halogenated nucleobase analogs can be incorporated into the DNA during the cell reproduction cycle. In the present study 8.44 eV photon irradiation induced single strand breaks (SSB) in DNA sequences modified with the radiosensitizer 5-bromouracil (5BrU) and 8-bromoadenine (8BrA) are investigated. 5BrU was incorporated in the 13mer oligonucleotide flanked by different nucleobases. It was demonstrated that the highest SSB cross sections were reached, when cytosine and thymine were adjacent to 5BrU, whereas guanine as a neighboring nucleobase decreases the activity of 5BrU indicating that competing reaction mechanisms are active. This was further investigated with respect to the distance of guanine to 5BrU separated by an increasing number of adenine nucleotides. It was observed that the SSB cross sections were decreasing with an increasing number of adenine spacers between guanine and 5BrU until the SSB cross sections almost reached the level of a non-modified DNA sequence, which demonstrates the high sequence dependence of the sensitizing effect of 5BrU. 8BrA was incorporated in a 13mer oligonucleotide as well and the strand breaks were quantified upon 8.44 eV photon irradiation in direct comparison to a non-modified DNA sequence of the same composition. No clear enhancement of the SSB yield of the modified in comparison to the non-modified DNA sequence could be observed. Additionally, secondary electrons with a maximum energy of 3.6 eV were generated when using Si as a substrate giving rise to further DNA damage. A clear enhancement in the SSB yield can be ascertained, but to the same degree for both the non-modified DNA sequence and the DNA sequence modified with 8BrA.",Li4Na2CsB7O14: a new edge-sharing [BO4]5- tetrahedra containing borate with high anisotropic thermal expansion.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30633273,"Chemical communications (Cambridge, England)",2019 01 24,"Li4Na2CsB7O14 with unique edge-sharing [BO4]5- tetrahedra, an unprecedented [B14O28]14- cluster, and high anisotropic thermal expansion has been obtained under atmospheric pressure conditions, indicating that high pressure is not essential for obtaining edge-sharing [BO4]5- tetrahedra-containing borates.

Though the thymidine:4-thiothymidine dimer is an important structure in the DNA duplex, the molecular-level photoreaction mechanisms are still obscure. Herein, high-level QM/MM methods were adopted to investigate the photoinduced cycloaddition and (6-4) reactions of the thymidine:4-thiothymidine dimer in the DNA duplex, namely, d(ACCT(4ST)CGC:TGGAAGCG). Based on the calculated results, we identified five efficient nonadiabatic decay pathways to populate the T1 state from the initially occupied S2 state of Tp4ST via two crucial intersection structures, i.e., S2/S1 and S2/T2/S1/T1. Such photophysical processes are mainly localized on the 4-thiothymidine chromophore. After hopping to the T1 state, the light-induced [2+2] cycloaddition reaction could take place via a stepwise and nonadiabatic reaction pathway, which starts from Tp4ST via T1cc or T1cs intermediates in the T1 state and ends up with S5-thietane in the S0 state. By contrast, the concerted and thermal cycloaddition pathway in the ground state has a remarkable energy barrier, which is mechanistically less important. The subsequent generation of S5-(6-4) from S5-thietane is a concerted process in the S0 state with the simultaneous fission of the C4-S8 bond and the formation of the S8-H9 bond. In the end, we believe our present work will provide important mechanistic insights into photo-isomerization of thio-substituted nucleobases in DNA duplexes."

Yet most antimicrobial peptides seem to possess cytotoxic effects on non-cancerous cells. Nisin, an antimicrobial peptide and FDA approved food preservative, has recently been found to induce selective apoptotic cell death and reduced cell proliferation in different cancer cell lines. However, the mechanism of nisin interaction with cancer cell membranes remains unexplored. Using potentiometric dye-based fluorescence and monolayer surface pressure-area isotherms we find that nisin interaction enhances the fluidity and reduces the dipole potential of a neuroblastoma cell membrane model. The quantified compressibility modulus suggests that the changes in fluidity are predominantly driven by the nisin interaction with the non-raft like regions. However, the measured positive Gibbs free energy of mixing and enthalpy hints that nisin, owing to its unfavorable mixing with cholesterol, might significantly disrupt the raft-like domains.",Unexpected trends in the hydrophobicity of fluorinated amino acids reflect competing changes in polarity and conformation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30633256,Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP,2019 01 23,"Fluorination can dramatically improve the thermal and proteolytic stability of proteins and their enzymatic activity. Key to the impact of fluorination on protein properties is the hydrophobicity of fluorinated amino acids. We use molecular dynamics simulations, together with a new fixed-charge, atomistic force field, to quantify the changes in hydration free energy, ΔGHyd, for amino acids with alkyl side chains and with 1 to 6 -CH → -CF side chain substitutions. Fluorination changes ΔGHyd by -1.5 to +2 kcal mol-1, but the number of fluorines is a poor predictor of hydrophobicity. Changes in ΔGHyd reflect two main contributions: (i) fluorination alters side chain-water interactions; we identify a crossover point from hydrophilic to hydrophobic fluoromethyl groups which may be used to estimate the hydrophobicity of fluorinated alkyl side-chains; (ii) fluorination alters the number of backbone-water hydrogen bonds via changes in the relative side chain-backbone conformation. Our results offer a road map to mechanistically understand how fluorination alters hydrophobicity of (bio)polymers.",Biological activity of human mesenchymal stromal cells on polymeric electrospun scaffolds.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30633255,Biomaterials science,2019 06 14,"Electrospinning provides a simple robust method to manufacture scaffolds for tissue engineering applications. Though varieties of materials can be used, optimization and biocompatibility tests are required to provide functional tissue regeneration. Moreover, many studies are limited to 2D electrospun constructs rather than 3D templates due to the production of high density packed fibres, which result in poor cell infiltration. Here, we optimised electrospinning parameters for three different polymers: poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL), polylactic acid (PLA) and poly(ethylene oxide terephthalate)/poly(butylene terephthalate) (PA) copolymers. Human mesenchymal stromal cells (hMSCs) were cultured on scaffolds for 14 days to study the scaffolds' biocompatibility and their multi-lineage differentiation potential or maintenance of stemness in the absence of chemical stimuli. For all scaffolds, a high and stable metabolic activity was measured throughout the culture time with a high proliferation rate compared to day 1 (PCL 5.8-, PLA 4-, PA 4.9-fold). The metabolism of hMSCs was also measured through glucose and lactate concentrations, showing no cytotoxic levels up to 14 days. Total glycosaminoglycan (GAG) production was the highest in PA electrospun scaffolds. When normalized to DNA, GAG production was the highest in PLA and PA scaffolds. All scaffolds were prone to differentiate to an osteogenic lineage, with PCL providing the highest alkaline phosphatase and collagen type Ia gene upregulation. As PA had the most stable fibre formation, it was chosen as a template to further incorporate stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), and stimulate higher hMSC infiltration. These scaffolds provided significantly higher hMSC infiltration than normal PA scaffolds. In conclusion, our optimized biocompatible electrospun scaffolds have shown promising regulation of hMSC fate. When combined with migratory stimulating cytokines, these scaffolds may overcome the known challenges of poor cellular infiltration typical of micro- and nano-fibrillary random meshes.",Effect of the Wnt signal-RANKL/OPG axis on the enhanced osteogenic integration of a lithium incorporated surface.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30633253,Biomaterials science,2019 06 14,"Bone remolding involves the formation of new bone by osteoblasts and the absorption of old bones by osteoclasts. Due to the vital role of osteoblasts and osteoclasts during bone regeneration, it might be feasible to promote osseointegration around the titanium implants by stimulating osteoblasts and inhibiting osteoclasts by modifying the surfaces of the implants. Lithium is used in the treatment of psychiatric patients, and it may be associated with osteogenesis. In this study, lithium was incorporated with sandblasted, large-grit and acid-etched titanium implants via a hydrothermal treatment. In vitro, the nano-scale surface enhanced the adhesion and proliferation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs). Moreover, the SLA-Li surface displayed a negative effect on the process of osteoclastogenesis. Further mechanism analysis indicated that the canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway was activated according to the results of RT-PCR and western blotting. More importantly, the RANKL/OPG signaling axis was also involved in these effects on the SLA-Li surface. The experiments in vivo proved that the SLA-Li surface could induce the bone formation and osseointegration during the early osseointegration after the dental implant surgery. These results suggested that bone homeostasis could be manipulated by an SLA-Li surface, which implied that this new surface might serve as a promising material for clinical application in the future.",Solar-driven capacity enhancement of aqueous redox batteries with a vertically oriented tin disulfide array as both the photo-cathode and battery-anode.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30633252,"Chemical communications (Cambridge, England)",2019 01 24,"An innovative photo-enhanced aqueous redox battery (PEARB) built upon a simple two-electrode configuration is demonstrated.

In neural cells, recombinant HSP70 reduces the toxic effect of Aβ and its isomeric forms. Here we describe the proteome of the neuroblastoma cell line after incubation with amyloid peptides Aβ42 and isomerized Asp7 (isoAβ42) without and with human recombinant heat shock protein 70 (HSP70). Incubation of SH-SY5Y cell culture with the synthetic Aβ-peptides leads to a decrease in the levels of several cytoskeleton proteins (e.g., ACTN1, VIME, TPM3) and several chaperonines involved in the folding of actin and tubulin (TCPQ, TCPG, TCPE, TCPB). These changes are accompanied by an increase in the expression of calmodulin and the proteins involved in folding in the endoplasmic reticulum and endoplasmic cell stress response. The presence of exogenous HSP70 has led to an increase in expression of several chaperones and a few other proteins including endogenous HSP70. A combined effect of recombinant HSP70 with Aβ peptides reduced cell apoptosis and significantly decreased the level of tubulin phosphorylation caused by the addition of Aβ peptides.",[Structure and Features of Amino Acid Sequences of L-Modules in SH3-Like Folds].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30633250,Molekuliarnaia biologiia,2019 03 23,"A novel L-shaped repeat module whose structure can be represented as β-strand-loop-β-strand has been identified in a stereochemical analysis of nonhomologous SH3-like folds. β-Strands of the L-module are positioned at a ~90° angle to each other in different orthogonally packed β-layers. Together with a crossover loop, they form a half-turn of a right-handed superhelix. A database of 60 nonhomologous SH3-like domains has been compiled using the Protein Data Bank to study structural similarities and differences of L-modules. Occurrence frequencies of L-modules have been determined depending on the length of their loops. It has been shown that L-modules with βmαααβn- and βmαααβαβn-conformations, where m and n are numbers of β-residues in the first and second β-strands, occur most often (57 and 8%, respectively). Spatial structures of L-modules of the same type are very similar, demonstrated through superimposing them using computer programs.

While invertebrate genomes contain only one sestrin gene, mammalian and other vertebrate genomes comprise three highly homologous genes that encode Sestrin 1, 2 and 3 proteins (Sesn1, Sesn2 and Sesn3). Sestrins are activated in response to a variety of stimuli and trigger metabolic shifts promoting cell survival under stress conditions. Although cellular stress within an organism is often caused by external stimuli it can be induced by excess of cytokines, chemokines, reactive oxygen species which are produced during aberrant metabolic or immune processes and are involved in regulation of cell physiological states including cell death. Activation of sestrins facilitates cell adaptation to stress through stimulation of antioxidant response and autophagy through regulation of the signaling pathways mediated by AMPK and mTOR kinases. These activities are involved in protection of the organism during physical exercise and certain level of sestrins activity contributes to the development of age-related diseases. However, prolonged activation of sestrins under chronic stress may cause negative effects for the organism.",[Intersubunit Mobility of the Ribosome].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30633236,Molekuliarnaia biologiia,2019 03 23,"Ribosomes are ribonucleoprotein nanoparticles synthesizing all proteins in living cells.

Long noncoding RNAs play an essential role in the regulation of gene expression in all tissues and on all developmental stages. They are involved in a number of signaling pathways, and their aberrant functioning can be pathogenic. This review aims to summarize current state-of-the-art structures of these transcripts in this research field, their genomic localization, their functions, and underlying mechanisms. It also focuses on cancer-associated aberrations of long noncoding RNAs, as well as on prospects of their application in tumor diagnostics and therapy.

To date, the highest fixation stability has been observed for angular stable locking plates. However, there is still little medical literature regarding breakage of these plates. The purpose of the present study was to report the results of plate breakage around D-hole with the use of both types of locking plate fixation for MOWHTO.Medical records of 12 patients who experienced plate breakage after MOWHTO with either a TomoFix or OhtoFix plate between August 2013 and August 2016 were retrospectively reviewed.A total of 12 patients (7 males and 5 females) who experienced plate breakage at the screw hole just above the osteotomy were evaluated (age, 63 ± 8 years; body mass index (BMI), 28 ± 2 kg/m; opening gap height, 12 ± 2 mm). There were 9 patients (75%) with plate breakage and loss of correction necessitating revision surgery, and 11 patients (92%) had lateral cortical hinge fractures postoperatively. Of the 9 patients with loss of correction necessitating revision surgery, 4 had a TomoFix plate and 5 had an OhtoFix plate. The only statistically significant association with broken plates lost reduction was the presence of lateral cortical hinge fractures (P = .003), but there was no significant association with age, gender, BMI, diabetes, smoking, plate type, opening gap height, and material used to fill the wedge. In addition, mean knee society score in the 12 patients was significantly higher postoperatively than preoperatively (P < .001).Since the amount of plate breakage was just over 1% and with only 12 in total, no true conclusion can be made with certainty. However, in the face of no lateral hinge or cortical disruption, there is a 99% success rate with the plate described. If the lateral hinge is disrupted, a restriction of activity or weight bearing may be needed.","Balance control, agility, eye-hand coordination, and sport performance of amateur badminton players: A cross-sectional study.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30633230,Medicine,2019 01 25,"In this study, balance performance, agility, eye-hand coordination, and sports performance were compared between amateur badminton players and active controls.Thirty young adult badminton players and 33 active controls participated in the study.

Medical treatment included the use of antibiotics and supportive care. Surgery was performed in cases with subperiosteal abscess (>1 cm) or clinical deterioration despite antibiotic therapy.All of the patients (11 men and 6 women) were term neonates. The main complaints were redness or swelling around the affected bone and fever. The most common sites were the femur (29.4%) and humerus (23.5%). There were 14 (82.35%) cases with positive cultures: Staphylococcus accounted for 71.43% (n = 10), followed by Salmonella (n = 1), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 1), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 1), and Escherichia coli (n = 1). X-rays (n = 14), ultrasound (n = 6), computed tomography (CT) (n = 5), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (n = 7) were performed. Three of 14 x-rays were not pathological at the onset of the disease, while the positive rate of MRI in detecting osteomyelitis was 100%.

One had chromosomal abnormality and 1 had surgery to repair the shunt 12-days post birth. In the 2 cases that did not receive repair surgery, sonographic examination revealed the portal-hepatic venous shunt was not closed at the 6-month follow-up period. However, the 1 case that had repair surgery appeared healthy at the 3-month follow-up period.UPSVS is extremely rare. Type I shunts have the poorest prognosis, and the presence of the intrahepatic portal venous system is key to live birth in UPSVS regardless of types. Chromosomal abnormalities and other organ anomalies can occur in any types of UPSVS. Therefore, karyotyping and examination of other organs should be performed once UPSVS is detected.",Comparison of keyhole endoscopy and craniotomy for the treatment of patients with hypertensive cerebral hemorrhage.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30633227,Medicine,2019 01 25,"By comparing the intraoperative and postoperative conditions under different surgical methods, namely, keyhole endoscopy and craniotomy, we aim to provide more reasonable surgical treatment for patients with hypertensive cerebral hemorrhage.Eighty-nine patients with cerebral hemorrhage at Rizhao People's Hospital between January 2015 and December 2016 were analyzed retrospectively. Patients were assigned to the keyhole endoscopy group and the craniotomy group. The intraoperative (the duration of operation, operative blood transfusion and loss, and hematoma clearance rate) and the postoperative parameters (death rate, rebleeding rate, edema, and postoperative activity of daily living [ADL] scores) of the 2 groups were compared.Compared with the craniotomy group, the keyhole endoscopy group exhibited decreases in mean blood loss (P < .05, 180 ± 13.6 mL vs 812 ± 35.2 mL), blood transfusion (P < .05, 0 mL vs 480 ± 13.6 mL), the average surgical duration of operation (P < .05, 113 ± 14.3 minutes vs 231 ± 26.1 minutes), and the severe edema rate (P < .05, 10.9% vs 72.1%) and increases in the average hematoma clearance rate (P < .05, 95.6% vs 82.3%) and postoperative ADL scores (P < .05, 85.2% vs 39.0%). Neither the death rate (P > .05, 4.3% vs 4.7%) nor rebleeding rate (P > .05, 2.2% vs 2.3%) showed any obvious changes.Keyhole endoscopy for the treatment of hypertensive intracerebral hemorrhage has the advantages of minimal trauma with good effects, and its main reason for short operation time, reduced bleeding, and high hematoma clearance rate is the ""brain-hematoma"" pressure gradient. Use of the intraoperative micropull technique and removal of intracerebral hematoma in the shortest time possible are critical factors contributing to the high ADL scores in the keyhole endoscopy group.

This study aimed to screen a panel of key genes and to identify their potential impact on the molecular pathways associated with the development of PDAC. Four gene expression profiles, GSE28735, GSE15471, GSE102238, and GSE43795, were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. The intersection of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in each dataset was obtained using Venn analysis. Gene ontology (GO) function and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway (KEGG) analysis were subsequently carried out. To screen for hub genes, a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed.The intersection of the DEGs revealed 7 upregulated and 9 downregulated genes. Upon relaxation of the selection criteria, 58 upregulated and 32 downregulated DEGs were identified. The top 5 biological processes identified by GO analysis involved peptide cross-linking, extracellular matrix (ECM) disassembly, regulation of the fibroblast growth factor receptor signaling pathway, mesoderm morphogenesis, and lipid digestion. The results of KEGG analysis revealed that the DEGs were significantly enriched in pathways involved in protein digestion and absorption, ECM-receptor interaction, pancreatic secretion, and fat digestion and absorption. The top ten hub genes were identified based on the PPI network.In conclusion, the identified hub genes may contribute to the elucidation of the underlying molecular mechanisms of PDAC and serve as promising candidates that can be utilized for the early diagnosis and prognostic prediction of PDAC.

Accessory navicular bone (ANB) has been evaluated by bone scintigraphy only qualitatively and semiquantitatively. However, a truly objective quantitative assessment of ANB is lacking. Here, we measured the maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) of the ANB and investigated its usefulness as an imaging biomarker for ANB.Consecutive quantitative bone SPECT/CT studies that had been performed on the foot were retrospectively analyzed. One hundred five patients (male:female = 44:61; median age = 32.0 [range, 11-81] years old; 31 negative controls without ANB and 74 patients with ANB [7 unilateral and 67 bilateral]) and their 210 feet were investigated. The ANBs were classified into types I, II, III (Geist classification), and 0 (contralateral navicular of unilateral ANB). Type II ANBs were subclassified into II-1 (with bony abnormality) or II-0 (without bony abnormality). The treatment modality was observation, conservative treatment, or surgical removal. The associations between the SUVmax and clinical findings, including surgery, were investigated.Patients with type II-1 ANB had the highest SUVmax among all ANB types (P < .001). The SUVmax of symptomatic ANB was greater than that for asymptomatic ANB (P < .001), and the SUVmax for the surgically resected ANB group was also significantly higher than that for the observation only or conservative treatment group (P < .001). Subtype II-1 had a significantly higher SUVmax compared with subtype II-0 (P < .001). Logistic regression analyses in type II ANB showed that young age (P = .020) and SUVmax (P = .031) were significant predictors for surgery. Receiver operating characteristic curve and survival analyses revealed an optimal SUVmax cutoff of 5.27 g/mL for predicting final surgical treatment.SUVmax derived from quantitative bone SPECT/CT was strongly associated with symptom, surgical treatment, and a known high-risk type of ANB. Risk stratification for final surgical treatment of ANB can be achieved using the SUVmax from quantitative bone SPECT/CT.",Successful entecavir plus prednisolone treatment for hepatitis B virus-associated membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis: A case report.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30633192,Medicine,2019 01 25,"Adult-onset hepatitis B virus-associated membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (HBV-MPGN) is generally refractory, and an effective treatment for this condition has not been established.

We aimed to identify regional resting perfusion changes in subjects with acute sleep deprivation.Thirty-three healthy subjects with habitual good sleep participated in 36 hours (2 days and 1 night) of sleep deprivation and then underwent the attention network test and pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling scanning. Regional cerebral blood flow was used to compare cerebral perfusion before and after sleep deprivation. Correlation analyses of regional perfusion changes and scores on the attention network test were performed.Compared with the baseline (n = 20) scans, the scans of subjects after sleep deprivation (n = 26) revealed a slower response time (549.99 milliseconds vs 603.36 milliseconds; t = -2.301; P = .028) and a significantly higher lapse rate (0.88% vs 22.85%; t = -2.977; P = .006). The sleep deprivation subjects showed lower cerebral blood flow (CBF) in the left parahippocampal gyrus/fusiform cortex (pHipp/Fus), right pHipp/Fus, and right prefrontal cortex (PFC) relative to the baseline subjects (Gaussian random field correction, voxel level P < .01, and cluster level P < .05). Although no significant relationships were observed between the altered regional CBF (rCBF) values and the attention network test scores, the receiver-operating characteristic and leave-one-out cross-validation analyses revealed that significant decreases in rCBF in the bilateral pHipp/Fus and right PFC could discriminate between sleep deprivation and good sleep status.We observed that rCBF was reduced after 36 hours (2 days and 1 night) of sleep deprivation.

To address this issue, we explore the relationship between the IFITM3-rs12252 genetic variants and the progression of HCC in this study.A total of 336 candidates were enrolled in the study, including 156 patients with HBV related HCC and 180 patients with chronic Hepatitis B infections or liver cirrhosis. Liver cirrhosis or chronic hepatitis B were diagnosed with clinical characteristics and staging, laboratory testing, and imaging results of viral infection and hepatic damage. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was employed to determine the gene polymorphism of IFITM3, and analyzed with the GraphPad Prism v 5.The patients with HCC had a significantly higher proportion of IFITM3 rs12252-CC as compared with the patients with chronic HBV infection or liver cirrhosis. Moreover, the distribution of CC genotype in HCC patients with low differentiation was significantly higher than that in those with high differentiation. Furthermore, the patients with CC genotype were found with bigger tumor size, higher percentage of vascular thrombosis, higher distribution of low differentiation and higher 5-year relapse rate than those with CT/TT genotypes.This study indicates a correlation between the IFITM3-rs12252 CC genotype and the progression of HCC.","Nonobstructive coronary artery myocardial infarction complicated by heart failure, ventricular aneurysm, and incessant ventricular arrhythmia: A case report.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30633184,Medicine,2019 01 28,"Myocardial infarction with nonobstructive coronary artery (MINOCA) is one of the common causes of cardiac related death.

The safety of abortion is similar to that of other types of office- and clinic-based procedures, and facility requirements should be based on assuring high-quality, safe performance of all such procedures. False concerns for patient safety are being used as a justification for promoting regulations that specifically target abortion. The Project on Facility Guidelines for the Safe Performance of Primary Care and Gynecology Procedures in Offices and Clinics was undertaken by clinicians, consumers, and representatives from accrediting bodies to review the available evidence and guidelines that inform safe delivery of outpatient care. Our overall objective was to develop evidence-informed consensus guidelines to promote health care quality, safety, and accessibility.

These are sometimes referred to as ""track and triggers systems"" with tracking meant to denote periodic observation of physiology and trigger being a predetermined response criteria. This review article examines the most widely used EWS, with special attention paid to those used in military and trauma populationsThe earliest EWS is the Modified Early Earning Score (MEWS). In MEWS, points are allocated to vital signs based on their degree of abnormality, and summed to yield an aggregate score. A score above a threshold would elicit a clinical response such as a rapid response team. MEWS was subsequently followed up with the United Kingdom's National Early Warning Score, the electronic cardiac arrest triage score, and the 10 Signs of Vitality score, among others.Severity of illness indicators have been in military and civilian trauma populations, such as the Revised Trauma Score, Injury Severity Score, and Trauma and Injury Severity. The sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score and its attenuated version qSOFA were developed to aggressively identify patients near septic shock.Effective EWS have certain characteristics. First, they should accurately capture vital signs information. Second, almost all data should be derived electronically rather than manually. Third, the measurements should take into consideration multiple organ systems. Finally, information that goes into an EWS must be captured in a timely manner.Future trends include the use of machine learning to detect subtle changes in physiology and the inclusion of data from biomarkers. As EWS improve they will be more broadly used in both military and civilian environments.

Although the association between omega-3 PUFA insufficiency and progressive neuropathological processes remains speculative, evidence from translational research suggests that omega-3 PUFA insufficiency may represent a plausible and modifiable risk factor not only for enduring neurodevelopmental abnormalities in brain structure and function, but also for increased vulnerability to neurodegenerative processes. Recent evidence from human neuroimaging studies suggests that lower omega-3 PUFA intake/status is associated with accelerated gray matter atrophy in healthy middle-aged and elderly adults, particularly in brain regions consistently implicated in mood and psychotic disorders, including the amygdala, anterior cingulate, hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, and temporal cortex. Human neuroimaging evidence also suggests that both low omega-3 PUFA intake/status and psychiatric disorders are associated with reductions in white matter microstructural integrity and increased rates of white matter hyperintensities. Preliminary evidence suggests that increasing omega-3 PUFA status is protective against gray matter atrophy and deficits in white matter microstructural integrity in patients with mood and psychotic disorders. Plausible mechanisms mediating this relationship include elevated pro-inflammatory signaling, increased synaptic regression, and reductions in cerebral perfusion. Together these associations encourage additional neuroimaging research to directly investigate whether increasing omega-3 PUFA status can mitigate neuropathological processes in patients with, or at high risk for, psychiatric disorders.",Developing guideline-based quality indicators: assessing gaps in pain management practice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30633009,International journal of evidence-based healthcare,2019 01 11,"In this article, the authors discuss a multiphase approach for developing quality indicators based on pain practice guidelines, and the challenges associated with the process.

Among the methods of personalized adjuvant immunotherapy, neoantigenic peptide-based drugs have demonstrated substantial efficiency. These drugs are designed to target mutant proteins arising from somatic alterations in the genome of tumor cells and thus stimulate immune response against tumor tissues. The methods of individual screening for potentially immunogenic mutations are mostly based on next-generation exome sequencing of tumor samples, which is a complex and costly procedure for clinical application. Targeted gene sequencing panels limited to a certain set of genes represent a reasonable alternative to WES. Targeted sequencing is also more efficient when there is a low amount of the sample DNA available. We have estimated the potential efficiency of targeted oncological panels in terms of somatic neoantigen profiling in colorectal cancer (colon and rectal adenocarcinoma). The clinical practice of identification of frequent somatic variants does not provide enough data for designing an efficient personalized drug when applied to low and medium mutated cancers such as colorectal cancer. Our analysis of 11 commercially available panels containing different number of genes has shown that neither the larger size of a panel nor its initial customization for colorectal cancer provides a significantly better estimation of an individual somatic mutation profile. The optimal approach is to use the general-purpose medium-sized cancer panels (2300-11200 amplicons and/or 150-600 genes). These panels allow to detect a sufficient number of immunogenic epitopes (>3) per patient for over 30-50% of patients.",[Central monoaminergic systems sensitivity to acute hypoxia with hypercapnia changes after the maintenance under the long-term social isolation].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30632979,Biomeditsinskaia khimiia,2019 05 13,"The experiments were performed in male albino outbred mice kept in a group and under the conditions of long-term social isolation.

The levels of dopamine (DA), serotonin (5-HT) and their metabolites - dioxyphenylacetic (DOPAC), homovanillic (HVA), and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic (5-HIAA) acids - were determined by HPLC in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus and striatum of the right and left sides of the brain. In the control mice kept both in the group and under the conditions of social isolation, a higher content of DA in the cortex of the left hemisphere has been found. In the other brain structures the monoamine content was symmetric. In the cerebral cortex of the mice in the group, acute hypoxia with hypercapnia led to a right-sided increase in the DA and 5HT levels. At the same time, the DOPAC content decreased in the left cortex. In mice in the group, under the hypoxia with hypercapnia conditions, the DA level in the left hippocampus increased. In the striatum, the content of monoamines and their metabolites did not change significantly. In animals kept for a long time under the conditions of social isolation, hypoxia with hypercapnia no statistically significant changes in the monoamines and their metabolites levels were found.

Osteolectin acts on Leptin Receptor+ (LepR+) skeletal stem cells and other osteogenic progenitors in bone marrow to promote their differentiation into osteoblasts. Here we identify a receptor for Osteolectin, integrin α11, which is expressed by LepR+ cells and osteoblasts. α11β1 integrin binds Osteolectin with nanomolar affinity and is required for the osteogenic response to Osteolectin. Deletion of Itga11 (which encodes α11) from mouse and human bone marrow stromal cells impaired osteogenic differentiation and blocked their response to Osteolectin. Like Osteolectin deficient mice, Lepr-cre; Itga11fl/fl mice appeared grossly normal but exhibited reduced osteogenesis and accelerated bone loss during adulthood. Osteolectin binding to α11β1 promoted Wnt pathway activation, which was necessary for the osteogenic response to Osteolectin.

Three recognized viruses were also recovered: Culex flavivirus (family Flaviviridae), Houston virus (family Mesoniviridae) and Umatilla virus (family Reoviridae). The genome of Skunk River virus contains 10 segments and its organization is characteristic of viruses in the genus Orbivirus (family Reoviridae). The coding region of each segment was fully sequenced, revealing that the greatest nucleotide identity was to the corresponding regions of Big Cypress orbivirus and Sathuvachari virus, two recently described mosquito-associated orbiviruses. The phylogenetic inference is in agreement with these findings. In vitro host range experiments revealed that Aedes, Anopheles and Culex cell lines, and select lepidopteran and rodent cell lines, are permissive to Skunk River virus replication.

Strains of Streptomyces coelicolor with mutations in the gene ppm1, encoding polyprenol phosphate mannose synthase, and in pmt, encoding a protein O-mannosyltransferase, are resistant to phage ϕC31 and have greatly increased susceptibility to some antibiotics, including vancomycin. In this work, second-site suppressors of the vancomycin susceptibility were isolated. The suppressor strains fell into two groups. Group 1 strains had increased resistance to vancomycin, teicoplanin and β-lactams, and had mutations in the two-component sensor regulator system encoded by vanSR, leading to upegulation of the vanSRJKHAX cluster. Group 2 strains only had increased resistance to vancomycin and these mostly had mutations in sco2592 or sco2593, genes that are derepressed in the presence of phosphate and are likely to be required for the synthesis of a phosphate-containing extracellular polymer. In some suppressor strains the increased resistance was only observed in media with limited phosphate (mimicking the phenotype of wild-type S. coelicolor), but two strains, DT3017_R21 (ppm1-vanR-) and DT3017_R15 (ppm1- sco2593-), retained resistance on media with high phosphate content.

As a matter of fact, the amount of disposed items is increasing distinctively and the issue of a proper handling of end-of-life textiles is becoming more important. The objective of this mini review is, first to give a brief overview of the already available textile recycling methods, and subsequently it will discuss innovative developments of new recycling processes in the textile recycling sector. A special focus of this review lies on the emerging field of biochemical fibre recycling processes, which could become a major step on the way to a circular economy in the textile processing chain. Owing to the high selectivity of bio-catalysts, enzymes, these processes could be used to remove a specific fibre material from multi-component textiles. As the complexity of textiles is reduced, the recyclability is increased.",Efficacy of infliximab as a switched biologic in rheumatoid arthritis patients in daily clinical practice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30632931,Immunological medicine,2019 02 18,"To assess the efficacy and safety of switching to infliximab (IFX) from other biological disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) among Japanese patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in daily practice. We examined 24 consecutive RA patients who had not achieved low disease activity (LDA) as the disease activity score-28 for rheumatoid arthritis with erythrocyte sedimentation rate (DAS28-ESR) despite previous bDMARD therapy in this cohort study. We attempted to determine predictive variables that are associated with achieving DAS28-ESR LDA at 22 weeks post-IFX introduction, by performing univariate analysis. The median DAS28-ESR at baseline was 5.41. Sixteen patients (66.7%) had been treated with a tumor necrosis factor inhibitor (TNF-i), and the other eight patients (33.3%) received a non-TNF-i (abatacept or tocilizumab). Nine patients (37.5%) achieved LDA or remission at 22 weeks. Univariate analyses showed that the variable to predict LDA achievement at 22 weeks was tender joints (>8 counts) at baseline (adjusted odds ratio, 0.10; 95% confidence interval, 0.01-0.63; p = .02). Nine adverse events were observed during the study period, and infection requiring hospitalization was observed in one patient.

In addition to the obnoxious fumes and hazardous leachate, heat generation is continuously observed within the landfill during the aerobic and anaerobic phases. Despite the negative impacts, such ""heat generation"" phenomenon can turn into valuable information to aid in detecting unauthorized landfill activities and tracing unrecorded dumping regions. The spatial distribution of waste buried under the ground can be approximated and revealed through measuring the ground surface heat flux. In this study, we demonstrate how to utilize thermal remote sensing techniques to measure the land surface temperature (LST), which can aid in outlining the waste dumping regions within a landfill. The Jeleeb Al-Shuyoukh landfill, located in Kuwait, was used to demonstrate the proposed method, where the record of the exact dumping location was missing during the Gulf war. Ten-year Landsat Thematic Mapper(TM)/Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) images (1985-1994) were acquired and processed in order to compute the LST within the landfill. Through combining the multi-temporal LST contours and overlay analysis, the most probable dumping regions within the landfill were outlined. A probability map was created to indicate the possible location of waste dumping within the studied landfill. With reference to the 50 boreholes drilled by the Environmental Protection Authority of Kuwait, our results derived during the summer and winter seasons both yielded an overall accuracy of 72%.",Identification of an internal cavity in the PhoQ sensor domain for PhoQ activity and SafA-mediated control.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30632929,"Bioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry",2019 04 01,"The PhoQ/PhoP two-component signal transduction system is conserved in various Gram-negative bacteria and is often involved in the expression of virulence in pathogens. The small inner membrane protein SafA activates PhoQ in Escherichia coli independently from other known signals that control PhoQ activity. We have previously shown that SafA directly interacts with the sensor domain of the periplasmic region of PhoQ (PhoQ-SD) for activation, and that a D179R mutation in PhoQ-SD attenuates PhoQ activation by SafA. In this study, structural comparison of wild-type PhoQ-SD and D179R revealed a difference in the cavity (SD (sensory domain) pocket) found in the central core of this domain. This was the only structural difference between the two proteins. Site-directed mutagenesis of the residues surrounding the SD pocket has supported the SD pocket as a site involved in PhoQ activity. Furthermore, the SD pocket has also been shown to be involved in SafA-mediated PhoQ control."

Part A, Chemistry, analysis, control, exposure & risk assessment",2019 04 01,"A simple determination method for pymetrozine and its metabolites in Chinese kale was developed using liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry. The method had good linearity (R2 > 0.99), accuracy (recoveries of 73.2-94.1%) and precision (relative standard deviation of 2.5-9.8%). Field results showed that half-lives of pymetrozine were 3.0-4.1 d in Chinese kale, and terminal residue concentrations were all below the United States Environmental Protection Agency's maximum residue limit (250 μg/kg) at harvest. Owing to risk quotient <100%, pymetrozine is unlikely to give rise to vital health concerns to humans following the recommended application guidelines. Moreover, effects of home processing on pymetrozine residues in Chinese kale were monitored. The processing factor values of four processes were between 0.19 and 0.60, which indicated that the used processes could remove pymetrozine residues from Chinese kale, especially pickling after washing process. The data could provide guidance to safe and reasonable use of pymetrozine and help Chinese governments establish a maximum residue limit for pymetrozine in Chinese kale.",Exploring young women's constructions of love and strategies to navigate violent relationships in South African informal settlements.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30632915,"Culture, health & sexuality",2019 01 11,"This paper explores young women's experiences and constructions of love-relationships and intimate partner violence in South Africa, and the role of agency in women's decisions to remain in or leave violent love-relationships. Understanding why young women stay in or leave violent love-relationships is key to developing nuanced understandings of agency and informing intimate partner violence prevention interventions. Data were collected from 15 young women in informal settlements in eThekwini Municipality, South Africa, via in-depth interviews, photovoice and participant observation, and were analysed inductively. While women's love-relationships were frequently violent, they often stayed in them for long periods, usually because the relationships met other important aspirations, including the desire for respect and dignity. Nonetheless, many women left when they no longer felt loved and respected, which they believed was shown by men's behaviours, specifically: indiscreet affairs; not spending time together; not spending money on her and any child(ren); and public (and humiliating) violence. Emotional and economic support from families also influenced women's decisions about leaving or staying. These data demonstrate that agency goes beyond definitive acts of leaving violent relationships; rather it is fluid, contested and contextual, with many factors influencing young women's goals and actions.","'Until we have laws … everything is useless!': intersectionality, self-identified needs and inequity among sexual and gender minorities in Macedonia.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30632914,"Culture, health & sexuality",2019 01 11,"There exists limited understanding about the intersectional nature of needs and inequities among sexual and gender minorities in Macedonia and Eastern Europe. We conducted a qualitative, cross-sectional and national needs assessment among 71 sexual and gender minority community members using semi-structured focus groups and interviews. Thematic analysis was used to better understand their self-identified needs, their concerns about equity and the intersectional nature of their needs. Community members discussed a wide range of health and healthcare needs as well as the social and structural factors that influence those needs, including: cultural norms; victimisation and safety concerns and the role of law, policy and politics; education and democratisation of knowledge; and economic and housing opportunities. Needs were patterned across different sexual and gender minority subgroups such that those experiencing heightened marginalisation (e.g. trans* persons) also experienced compounded forms of inequity. Given that sexual and gender minorities in Macedonia have numerous structurally induced intersectional needs, multilevel and multifaceted strategies are needed to ensure that their rights and needs are respected, protected and fulfilled at structural, community and individual levels.",'It's just a penis': the politics of publishing photos in research about sexuality.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30632913,"Culture, health & sexuality",2019 01 11,"This paper explores some of the challenges of publishing photographs generated as part of sexuality research. It aims to initiate discussion of these issues to enable sexuality researchers to consider and navigate the use of images in their work. Examples highlighting these difficulties are employed from a photo-method project which examined young people, sexuality and schooling. It is argued that existing child-sex-panics rendered these images risky and intensified their scrutiny by gatekeeping forces. The discussion contributes to a broader conversation within the field of sexualities about the constitution of sexuality research as dirty work. Specifically, the paper investigates how some publishing and editing practices might be conceptualised as constituting techniques that construct sexuality research as dirty work. By not publishing photos which form part of sexuality research, the knowledge it is possible for sexuality researchers to generate and circulate is subsequently curtailed.",Children's age at parental divorce and depression in early and mid-adulthood.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30632912,Population studies,2019 06 13,"This study aimed to assess whether children's age at their parents' divorce is associated with depression in early and mid-adulthood, as indicated by medication purchase.

Drawing on ethnographic field research in northern Karnataka among a highly understudied transgender group known as the jogappas, we describe the effects of overlapping forms of structural violence surrounding education, subsistence, family life and attempts to access social and health services. Findings reveal how social inequities are implicated in the emergence of transgender subjectivities along the road to becoming a jogappa.

Part A, Chemistry, analysis, control, exposure & risk assessment",2019 04 01,"Turkey plays an important role in the international trade of apricots as it has the largest production rate in the world. Since the sulphurisation process is allowed to be used for different products, the effect of residual sulphur and its compounds (which can be found in products as pesticide residues or additive residues) on the positive detection of carbon disulphide (CS2) still creates a big challenge in international trade. Therefore, the main objective of the present study was to investigate the effects of residues of sulphur or sulphur compounds on dithiocarbamate analysis methods based on CS2 measurement. In this study, apricots were chosen since they contain sulphur residues as a result of the sulphurisation process. Sulphur dioxide and dithiocarbamate analyses were conducted on dried apricots prepared with the sulphurisation process (SA) and without the sulphurisation process (NSA); analysis was by two different accredited laboratories. No of pesticide was applied to either SA or NSA samples. Although some of the NSA samples had <LOQ values, approximately 70 ± 32 mg/kg SO2 and 0.061 ± 0.021 mg/kg dithiocarbamate were detected for NSA samples. On the other hand, for the SA sample group, 927-2915 mg/kg of SO2 and 0.265-0.825 mg/kg of dithiocarbamate were detected. Furthermore, a strong correlation between residual sulphur and dithiocarbamate values was observed. This study showed that the analysis method based on CS2 measurement may lead to false positive results for dithiocarbamates when residues of sulphur or sulphur compounds are found in products as pesticide or additive residues. Therefore, residual sulphur compounds as a result of the sulphurisation process (which is not considered during the evaluation of products) must be taken into account during the evaluation of products for dithiocarbamates."

Periodic outbreaks have been associated with seed since the early twentieth century; of note, the disease has experienced a resurgence since 2011. Effective management of bacterial blight is dependent on accurate diagnosis and detection of the pathogen. Currently, detection of X. citri pv. malvacearum is performed by time-consuming microbiological methods. In this study, a novel and sensitive TaqMan-based qPCR protocol was developed to test for X. citri pv. malvacearum in cotton plant tissue. The primers developed are specific to five races of X. citri pv. malvacearum, but not to other Xanthomonas species or cotton-associated nonpathogenic bacteria. The efficiency of this assay was evaluated on artificially inoculated cotton leaves and seed, on naturally infected cotton leaves, and on bolls and seed originating from bacterial blight symptomatic bolls. The protocol's efficiency from artificially inoculated plant tissue was 102 copies g-1 and 37 copies from 1 g seed for leaves and seed, respectively. In addition, X. citri pv. malvacearum was detected from 94% of the seed samples originating from blight symptomatic bolls. The qPCR protocol provides a rapid and accurate method for diagnosis and detection of bacterial blight and offers a tool for monitoring X. citri pv. malvacearum and potentially reducing its spread in seed.",In-hospital outcomes after emergency or prophylactic veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation during transcatheter aortic valve implantation: a comprehensive review of the literature.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30632894,Perfusion,2019 01 11,"Veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (V-A ECMO) has been used to deal with life-threatening complications as well as back-up or active cardiovascular support during high-risk procedures in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI).

Here we show a new strategy for exploring environment- or mutation-caused changes in cell type- or tissue-specific methylation landscapes, which requires neither transgenic reporter cell lines nor physical separation. This approach takes advantage of a known distinct methylation signature existing in only one of the tissues within an organ under a particular condition. From the information on such compared published methylomes, one can design a set of PCR primers that specifically amplify bisulfite-converted DNA of two nearby genomic regions of interest, thus allowing for tissue-specific DNA methylation data. To validate the performance of the approach, we designed primers able to amplify a portion of a gene in the context of root biology: the Arabidopsis homeotic gene Glabra-2 (Gl2), expressed only in epidermis during cell differentiation. We found that the extent of methylated cytosines appears remarkably different when root epidermis-specific primers were used vs. non-specific ones under three genetic backgrounds involving mutations in genes also associated with the establishment of cell identity. Although the genetic or environmental perturbations to be studied might modify methylation in the primer-annealing zone, leading to a possible misinterpretation of the data, the strategy presented here can become a useful first round screening tool to detect differences in tissue-specific epigenetic status under new conditions.",Understanding the Barriers to Introducing Early Palliative Care for Patients with Advanced Cancer: A Qualitative Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30632886,Journal of palliative medicine,2019 05 07,"
Background:
 Palliative care is often underutilized or initiated late in the course of life-threatening illness. Randomized clinical Early Palliative Care (EPC) trials provide an opportunity for changing oncologists' perceptions of palliative care and their attitudes to referring patients to palliative care services. 
Aim:
 To describe French oncologists' perceptions of EPC and their effects on referral practices before a clinical EPC trial was launched. 
Design:
 A qualitative study involving semistructured face-to-face interviews. The data were analyzed using the Grounded Theory coding method. 
Setting/Participants:
 Thirteen oncologists and 19 palliative care specialists (PCSs) working at 10 hospitals all over France were interviewed. Most of them were involved in clinical EPC trials. 
Results:
 The findings suggest that referral to PCSs shortly after the diagnosis of advanced cancer increases the terminological barriers, induces avoidance patterns, and makes early disclosure of poor prognosis harder for oncologists. This situation is attributable to the widespread idea that palliative care means terminal care. In addition, the fact that the EPC concept is poorly understood increases the confusion between EPC and supportive care. 
Conclusion:
 Defining the EPC concept more clearly and explaining to health professionals and patients what EPC consists of and what role it is intended to play, and the potential benefits of palliative care services could help to overcome the wording barriers rooted in the traditional picture of palliative care. In addition, training French oncologists how to disclose ""bad news"" could help them cope with the emotional issues involved in referring patients to specialized palliative care.",Influenza vaccination for all pregnant women?

An USA survey adds new evidence that documents this bias. Therefore, it is essential to assess vaccine effectiveness and safety with RCTs. Cochrane reviews identified one RCT with ""low risk of bias"", in a medium-income country, with NNV 55 for mothers. Its data show an excess of local adverse effects, and a tendency to harm for serious adverse events, with uncertain or very limited protection against influenza. A subsequent larger trial in a very-low-income African country found an excess of infant serious infections plus deaths in the influenza vaccine group. Also an available previous small trial and a subsequent large one in Asian low-income countries showed in tendency more deaths in the offspring vaccine groups. Before promoting seasonal influenza vaccinations during all pregnancies, more independent trials are needed, with appropriate designs and comparators. Meanwhile, vaccination in second-third trimester could be offered communicating the uncertainties and promoting informed choices, without neglecting to promote other protective behaviors."

Here, literature on the cynomolgus monkey placenta is reviewed in regards to its similarity to the human placenta and particularly for its immunological role, which is not entirely mirrored in humans. Pertinent original data are included in this article. The cynomolgus monkey placenta is evaluated based on three aspects: first, morphological development; second, the spatial and temporal appearance of maternal and fetal immune cells and certain immune cell products of the innate and adaptive immune systems; and third, the expression of relevant immune tolerance-related molecules including the homologs of anti-human leucocyte antigen, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase, FAS/FAS-L, annexin II, and progesterone. Parameters relevant to the immunological role of the placenta are evaluated from the immunologically immature stage of gestational day (GD) 50 until more mature stages close to birth. Selected comparisons are drawn with human and other laboratory animal placentas. In conclusion, the cynomolgus monkey placenta has a high degree of morphological and physiological similarity to the human placenta. However, there are differences in the topographical distribution of cell types and immune tolerance-related molecules. Three basic features are recognized: (1) the immunological capacity of the placenta changes throughout the lifetime of the organ; (2) these immunological changes include multiple parameters such as morphological adaptations, cell type involvement, and changes in immune-relevant molecule expression; and (3) the immune systems of two genetically disparate individuals (mother and child) are functionally intertwined at the maternal-fetal interface.",The unsustainability of occupational based model diagrams.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30632860,Scandinavian journal of occupational therapy,2019 01 11,"Occupation-based models are generic explanations of occupational engagement.

Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) downregulate JAK2 via interference with chaperone function. Pracinostat, a pan-HDACi, has modest single-agent activity in myelofibrosis. We conducted a single-institution, phase 2, investigator-initiated trial of ruxolitinib plus pracinostat (begun after 12 weeks of ruxolitinib) in 25 patients with myelofibrosis, of whom 20 received both agents. Sixteen (80%) patients had objective responses (all 'clinical improvement'). The rate of spleen response (by palpation) was 74%, and that of symptom response 80%. Most responses occurred prior to pracinostat initiation. Three patients experienced improvement in bone marrow fibrosis, and one a near-complete molecular response after two years on study treatment. All patients discontinued pracinostat and are currently off-study. Pracinostat interruptions and dose reductions were frequent, often due to worsening anemia.

We estimated the cost-effectiveness of G + chemo versus R + chemo utilizing GALLIUM trial data and published literature. G + chemo had increased drug costs (undiscounted: $135,200 versus $127,700 for R + chemo), representing a relative increase of 5.9%. However, this was offset by a $6,400 lower cost for disease progression. G + chemo led to increased quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) relative to R + chemo of 0.81 (95% credible range, [CR]: 0.22-1.37), and the overall discounted incremental cost was $1,900 (95% CR: -$7,400 to $8,900).

Prior research on associations between patterns of sexual activity and contraceptive behaviors is limited. We assessed the influence of recent sexual activity on discontinuation and selection of specific contraceptive methods. We used weekly data from the Relationship Dynamics and Social Life (RDSL) study, a longitudinal 2.5-year population-based project that sampled woman ages 18 and 19 (N = 1,003) in one Michigan county. We estimated logistic and multinomial regression models that accounted for clustering of weekly observations within partnerships and women. Weekly discontinuation of longer-acting methods declined with increasing sexual activity in the past month, as did discontinuation of shorter-acting hormonal methods. Sexual activity was associated with decreased selection of condoms relative to other methods. Future research into life events that lead to changes in the frequency of sexual activity may provide insight into times when women are at risk of contraceptive discontinuation.

The majority of biopsies investigated revealed histological signs of acute GvHD. The highest incidence and most advanced grades of acute GvHD were found in the right colon and terminal ileum. We detected significant correlations between crypt or gland loss and histological grades of acute GvHD, and between the number of sites with crypt or gland loss and the time elapsed since alloHSCT.

The assumption was that phytocomplexes of tested varieties of the same plant species would exhibit generally similar chemical composition differing mostly in betalain content, which will be reflected by their biological activity. Betalain composition analysis and antioxidant profiles confirmed that the content and composition of these pigments is strongly correlated with the antioxidant activity of tested plant extracts measured by spectrophotometric methods and CAA test. However, the results of determinations of other biological activities showed that in the case of actual plant foods, there was no simple relationship between betalain content or composition and chemopreventive potential."

However, no studies have examined whether this effect is found among adolescents-a group for whom suicide is the 2nd leading cause of death. The current study tested the utility of implicit identification with death, using a Death Implicit Association Test (IAT), for detecting and predicting STBs in adolescents. Participants were 141 adolescents 12-19 years of age (81.6% female, 74.5% White) with a current psychiatric disorder and/or currently receiving outpatient psychiatric treatment. All participants completed the Death IAT and self-report measures of STBs at baseline, as well as self-report measures of STBs at 6-month and 1-year follow-ups. At baseline, stronger implicit identification with death (higher Death IAT score) was related to greater suicide ideation (SI) frequency, severity, and duration, but did not differ based on suicide attempt history. Prospectively, higher Death IAT scores predicted any occurrence (but not frequency) of SI over the subsequent year, but not when controlling for prior SI. Death IAT scores were higher among adolescents with prior attempts who reattempted suicide over the follow-up. Examination of stimuli-level results suggested that Death IAT differences may be driven by responses on trials with specific words, including suicide and die. Implicit identification with death may be a useful behavioral indicator of suicide risk in adolescents. Preliminary findings suggest that the Death IAT may aid in predicting STBs among youth receiving outpatient treatment.",Bridging the Child and Family Centered Care Gap: Therapeutic Conversations with Children and Families.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30632814,Comprehensive child and adolescent nursing,2019 01 11,Professor Linda Shields and Dr Mandie Foster from Charles Sturt University and Edith Cowan University in Australia discuss several models of care for children and families that exist and the prospect of using conversations with children and families as an intervention within healthcare to facilitate a child and family centered care approach.,An Exploration of How Individuals with an Ostomy Communicatively Manage Uncertainty.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30632813,Health communication,2019 01 11,"Individuals with an ostomy (a surgical diversion of part of the digestive tract through the abdomen) face a variety of uncertainties, due to the chronic and anatomy-altering nature of living with an ostomy, as well as the perceived stigma attached to having one.

Acute CCl4 intoxication resulted in a massive hepatic necrosis, in increased serum transaminases, and in a perturbation of oxidative stress parameters in liver tissue [malondyaldehide, glutathione (GSH), catalase]. CCl4 did not affect the expression of caspase-3 and cytochrome c as markers of apoptosis; however, CCl4 increased the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activity and the expression of autophagy-related protein LC3II and decreased the expression of p62 protein. The pre-treatment with DOLE significantly improved serum markers of liver damage, liver catalase activity, and GSH concentration, suggesting that antioxidative mechanism is responsible for hepatoprotection. Oral administration of DOLE did not influence LC3II conversion and p62 degradation in liver, but AMPK activity was significantly decreased, suggesting the energy balance perturbation as an additional potential mechanism of DOLE hepatoprotective effect.","Through a glass darkly: patients of the Illinois State Hospital for the Insane at Jacksonville, USA (1854-80).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30632810,History of psychiatry,2019 05 13,"The State Hospital for the Insane at Jacksonville, Morgan County, Illinois, was the first public hospital of its kind to be established in the state and among the earliest to be built on the 'Kirkbride Plan'.

Participants completed diary data over a period of 10 days and reported on the quality of their romantic encounters and their emotions, and on their sexual behavior in stable relationships or casual encounters. Four years later, they were asked to complete diary data again for 10 consecutive days and report on the quality of their romantic relationships and their positive and negative affect. Findings indicate that involvement in sexual behavior in stable romantic relationships was associated only with future romantic partner support. In contrast, earlier involvement in casual sexual behavior was associated with a number of future indices: lower partner support, greater negative affect as well as greater relationship tension, and dyadic hurtful behavior 4 years later. The differential role of sexuality within a stable relationship or casual encounters among adolescents for their future romantic development is discussed within a developmental framework.","Virulence Potential, Biofilm Formation, and Antibiotic Susceptibility of Listeria monocytogenes Isolated from Cattle Housed in a Particular Gaushala (Cattle Shelter) and Organized Farm.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30632791,Foodborne pathogens and disease,2019 03 06,The occurrence of Listeria monocytogenes was studied by using cultural and serological methods in cattle housed in a particular gaushala (cattle shelter) and organized dairy farm.,Provider opioid prescribing practices and the belief that opioids keep people living with HIV engaged in care: a cross-sectional study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30632790,AIDS care,2019 01 29,"We describe HIV providers' opioid prescribing practices and assess whether belief that chronic opioid therapy (COT) keeps people living with HIV (PLWH) engaged in care is associated with differences in these practices among providers from two HIV clinics.

MDR13435T variant allele might be more efficient to transport carbamazepine, whereas reduces the efflux activity of P-gp-mediated phenobarbital. Collectively, MDR1 (C3435T) polymorphism might impact the P-gp activity and antiepileptic agents efflux with drug specificity.",Intergenerational financial exchange and cognitive impairment among older adults in China.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30632788,Aging & mental health,2019 02 07,This study investigated the relationship between intergenerational financial exchange patterns and cognitive impairment among older Chinese adults.

Our group has discovered that Holliday Junction resolvase gene Gen1 is a potential candidate gene for CAKUT. Gen1 mutant mice showed CAKUT phenotypes similar to those observed in retinoic acid (RA)-deficient models. The expression of Raldh2, which encodes the key enzyme in RA synthesis, was reduced in Gen1 mutant metanephros through RNA sequencing. By real-time reverse transcription-PCR, the expression of both Raldh2 and downstream Ret was reduced in embryonic day (E) 11.5 Gen1 mutant ureters and E13.5 kidneys, and expression of RA receptor alpha was decreased in E13.5 Gen1 mutant ureters and kidneys. Further studies showed that all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) rescued solitary kidney phenotype and improved ureteric branching; ATRA should be administered after ureteric budding to avoid increasing the incidence of ectopic budding in Gen1 mutants. Luciferase intensity of RA response element was lower in CHO-K1 cells transfected with Gen1 siRNA than in those transfected with scrambled RNA, and this inhibitory effect could be reversed by ATRA. These findings indicate that Gen1 mutation can result in renal malformation through RA signaling and Gen1-loss-induced CAKUT can be partly rescued by ATRA.",A Chemical Category-Based Prioritization Approach for Selecting 75 Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) for Tiered Toxicity and Toxicokinetic Testing.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30632786,Environmental health perspectives,2019 05 08,"Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are a group of fluorinated substances of interest to researchers, regulators, and the public due to their widespread presence in the environment. A few PFASs have comparatively extensive amounts of human epidemiological, exposure, and experimental animal toxicity data (e.g., perfluorooctanoic acid), whereas little toxicity and exposure information exists for much of the broader set of PFASs. Given that traditional approaches to generate toxicity information are resource intensive, new approach methods, including in vitro high-throughput toxicity (HTT) testing, are being employed to inform PFAS hazard characterization and further (in vivo) testing. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the National Toxicology Program (NTP) are collaborating to develop a risk-based approach for conducting PFAS toxicity testing to facilitate PFAS human health assessments. This article describes the construction of a PFAS screening library and the process by which a targeted subset of 75 PFASs were selected. Multiple factors were considered, including interest to the U.S. EPA, compounds within targeted categories, structural diversity, exposure considerations, procurability and testability, and availability of existing toxicity data. Generating targeted HTT data for PFASs represents a new frontier for informing priority setting. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP4555."

The results provide a descriptive profile of twice-exceptional (e.g. demographics, average academic performance, and services utilized), trajectory plots that indicate how academic performance changes over time, and multilevel analyses that model growth in academic outcomes using demographics, school services, and giftedness as predictors. Some of the key findings are that twice-exceptional students show not only higher initial levels of academic performance, but they improve over time relative to the non-gifted ASD counterparts and-with the exception of Letter Word Matching-even relative to the general population. Moreover, they benefit from mental health services disproportionately.

Since 2013, treating physicians have the possibility to exempt patients from this disclosure obligation when no considerable risk of transmission is present. This study explored experiences of communication with clinical staff at HIV clinics regarding rules of conduct and infectiousness among men who have sex with men (MSM) living with HIV in Sweden. In-depth interviews were carried out with 10 MSM living with HIV in Sweden. Study participants all reported unmeasurable viral loads. Data were analyzed using qualitative content analysis. Five categories and one theme, ""Navigating between rules and reality"", were identified. We found that MSM living with HIV had good relationships with clinical staff at HIV clinics. Inconsistencies emerged regarding how they experienced receiving information about the rules of conduct and infectiousness. The findings indicate that lack of sound routines regarding how information and rules of conduct are communicated negatively affects MSM living with HIV and poses potential risks for the individual. The participants' expressed trust in staff at HIV clinics can provide a good basis for improved communication.",Interactions of salivary mucins and saliva with food proteins: a review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30632771,Critical reviews in food science and nutrition,2019 01 16,"Mucins are long glycoprotein molecules responsible for the gel nature of the mucous layer that covers epithelial surfaces throughout the body. Mucins, as the major salivary proteins, are also important proteins for the food oral processing and digestion. The interactions of salivary mucins and saliva with several food proteins and food protein emulsions, as well as their functional properties related to the food oral processing were reviewed in this paper. The target food proteins of focus were whey proteins (lactoferrin and beta-lactoglobulin) and non-whey proteins (casein, gelatin, galectin/lectin, and proline-rich proteins). Most of the studies suggest that electrostatic attraction (between positively charged food proteins with negatively charged moieties of mucin mainly on glycosylated region of mucin) is the major mode of interaction between them. On the other hand, casein attracts the salivary proteins only via non-covalent interactions due to its naturally self-assembled micellar structure. Moreover, recent studies related to β-lactoglobulin (BLG)-mucin interactions have clarified the importance of hydrophobic as well as hydrophilic interactions, such as hydrogen bonding. Furthermore, in vitro studies between protein emulsions and saliva observed a strong aggregating effect of saliva on caseinate and whey proteins as well as on surfactant-stabilized emulsions. Besides, the sign and the density of the charge on the surface of the protein emulsion droplets contribute significantly to the behavior of the emulsion when mixed with saliva. Other studies also suggested that the interactions between saliva and whey proteins depends on the pH in addition to the flow rate of the saliva. Overall, the role of interactions of food proteins and food protein emulsions with mucin/saliva-proteins in the oral perception, as well as the physicochemical and structural changes of proteins were discussed.","Using probiotics for type 2 diabetes mellitus intervention: Advances, questions, and potential.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30632770,Critical reviews in food science and nutrition,2019 01 16,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has become one of the most prevalent diseases on earth and several treatments have been developed. However, the current intervention approaches have not been as effective as expected. One promising supplementary strategy is the use of probiotics through direct or indirect approaches. Probiotics are microbial food cultures conferring health-promoting properties. In this review, we summarized the current theories and mechanisms of T2DM intervention using probiotics and hypothesize that probiotics intervene T2DM during its onsetting, developing, and complicating. For the first time, we comprehensively analyzed T2DM intervention in animal models using both wide-type probiotics in different forms and using recombinant probiotics. Then, probiotic intervention in T2DM patients was reviewed and the main results were compared with that obtained from animal studies. Finally yet importantly, remaining questions that are important such as in which form and in which state, as well as the future potential of probiotic intervention in T2DM were discussed from a perspective of food microbiologists. In conclusion, probiotic intervention in T2DM is promising but there are still many important issues unsolved yet. Critical review of the advances, questions, and potential of probiotic intervention in T2DM promotes the development of this approach for further application in humans.",Awareness and Interest in HIV Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis Among Street-Based Female Sex Workers: Results from a US Context.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30632769,AIDS patient care and STDs,2019 02 27,"Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) has the potential to be an empowering HIV prevention tool among female sex workers (FSW), yet little is known about PrEP awareness and interest in this population. Sex workers and Police Promoting Health in Risky Environments (SAPPHIRE) is a prospective cohort study of street-based FSW in Baltimore, MD. A cross-sectional analysis explored awareness and interest in PrEP among HIV-negative FSW. Multivariable Poisson regressions modeled associations between individual, interpersonal, and structural variables and PrEP awareness and interest. Of n = 232 FSW, 66% were white, half were less than 35 years old, 59% injected drugs daily, and 66% sold sex daily. Only 21% of FSW were aware of PrEP, though 74% were interested. PrEP awareness was associated with experiencing client condom coercion [adjusted incidence rate ratio (aIRR) = 0.50, 95% CI: 0.28-0.90] and condomless sex with an intimate partner (aIRR = 0.54, 95% CI: 0.30-0.98). PrEP interest was associated with perceiving PrEP as ""very easy"" to take (aIRR = 1.91, 95% CI: 1.49-2.45) and moving to an unfamiliar geographic area to sell sex (aIRR = 1.20, 95% CI: 1.04-1.39). Women who had a current gonorrhea or chlamydia infection were less likely to be interested in PrEP (aIRR = 0.75, 95% CI: 0.59-0.95). Though PrEP awareness among FSW is low, there are FSW who are significantly more likely to express interest in PrEP and outreach efforts should target these women. Results suggest that women-controlled HIV prevention methods may be important for reducing incidence among FSW.",Barriers impairing mineral bioaccessibility and bioavailability in plant-based foods and the perspectives for food processing.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30632768,Critical reviews in food science and nutrition,2019 01 16,"Plant-based foods gain more importance since they play a key role in sustainable, low-meat and healthy diets. In developing countries, these food products, especially legumes and cereals, are important staple foods. Nevertheless, the question arises on how efficient they are to deliver minerals and if it is useful to encourage their consumption to reduce the prevalence of mineral deficiencies? This review paper focuses on the discrepancy between the mineral content and the amount of minerals that can be released and absorbed from plant-based foods during human digestion which can be attributed to several inherent factors such as the presence of mineral antinutrients (phytic acid, polyphenols and dietary fiber) and physical barriers (surrounding macronutrients and cell wall). Further, this review paper summarizes the effects of different processing techniques (milling, soaking, dehulling, fermentation, germination and thermal processing) on mineral bioaccessibility and bioavailability of plant-based foods. The positive impact of these techniques mostly relies on the fact that antinutrients levels are reduced due to removal of fractions rich in antinutrients and/or due to their leaching into the processing liquid. Although processing can have a positive effect, it also can induce leaching out of minerals and a reduced mineral bioaccessibility and bioavailability.",Modulatory influence of sex hormones on vascular aging.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30632767,American journal of physiology. Heart and circulatory physiology,2019 02 20,"This review summarizes a presentation given during the ""Countermeasures to Cardiovascular Aging Symposium"" that was part of the American Physiological Society Conference on Cardiovascular Aging: New Frontiers and Old Friends held in Westminster, CO, in August 2017. Endothelial dysfunction, a characteristic of vascular aging, is a major risk factor for age-associated cardiovascular diseases. In women, the decline in endothelial function is attenuated until menopause, whereafter the rate of decline accelerates to match that seen in men. Sex differences in the decline in endothelial function have been attributed to changes in sex hormones with aging. Women have a progressive impairment in endothelial function across the stages of the menopause transition, related in part to declining estradiol levels. In contrast to women, little is known about the impact of declining testosterone levels on endothelial function in men. Some evidence suggests greater endothelial dysfunction in men with low testosterone compared with men with higher testosterone. The underlying causes of endothelial dysfunction with sex hormone deficiency are unknown but may be related to endothelial nitric oxide synthase dysfunction and oxidative stress. Lifestyle behaviors, including habitual endurance exercise, attenuates and reverses the age-associated decline in endothelial function in older men. However, in older women, these exercise adaptations are diminished or absent, possibly related to estrogen deficiency. Understanding how declines in sex hormones contribute to the vascular aging process in both women and men will inform effective sex-specific intervention strategies to preserve vascular health and prevent cardiovascular diseases.",Role of matrix metalloproteinases and histone deacetylase in oxidative stress-induced degradation of the endothelial glycocalyx.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30632766,American journal of physiology. Heart and circulatory physiology,2019 06 13,"The glycocalyx is crucial for normal endothelial function. It also tethers extracellular superoxide dismutase (SOD3), which protects the endothelium against oxidative damage. Proteolytic enzymes [matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs)] are capable of disrupting endothelial cell surface proteins, such as syndecans, resulting in derangements of the endothelial glycocalyx. We sought to test the role of MMPs in oxidative stress-mediated disruption of the endothelial glycocalyx and examine the effect of pharmacological inhibition of MMPs on mitigating this detrimental effect. We also examined the role of histone deacetylase (HDAC) in the oxidative stress-mediated MMP induction and glycocalyx remodeling. Oxidative stress was experimentally induced in human adipose microvascular endothelial cells using H2O2 and buthionine sulfoximine in the presence and absence of potent MMP and HDAC inhibitors. H2O2 and buthionine sulfoximine resulted in a notable loss of the endothelial glycocalyx; they also increased the expression and proteolytic activity of MMP-2 and MMP-9 and subsequently increased the shedding of syndecan-1 and SOD3 from the endothelial cell surface. MMP upregulation was accompanied by a decline in mRNA and protein levels of their inhibitors, tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase (TIMPs; TIMP-1 and TIMP-3). Furthermore, oxidative stress induced HDAC activity. Inhibition of MMPs and HDAC reversed syndecan-1 and SOD3 shedding and maintained endothelial glycocalyx integrity. HDAC inhibition increased TIMP expression and reduced MMP expression and activity in endothelial cells. Our findings shed light on MMPs and HDAC as therapeutically targetable mechanisms in oxidative stress-induced glycocalyx remodeling. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Oxidative stress, a hallmark of many diseases, damages the endothelial glycocalyx, resulting in vascular dysfunction. Studying the mechanistic link between oxidative stress and endothelial glycocalyx derangements might help discover new therapeutic targets to preserve vascular function. In this study, we investigated the involvement of matrix metalloproteinases and histone deacetylase in oxidative stress-induced endothelial glycocalyx degradation.",Placental vascular abnormalities in the mouse alter umbilical artery wave reflections.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30632765,American journal of physiology. Heart and circulatory physiology,2019 03 29,"Current methods to detect placental vascular pathologies that monitor Doppler ultrasound changes in umbilical artery (UA) pulsatility have only moderate diagnostic utility, particularly in late gestation. In fetal mice, we recently demonstrated that reflected pressure waves propagate counter to the direction of flow in the UA and proposed the measurement of these reflections as a means to detect abnormalities in the placental circulation. In the present study, we used this approach in combination with microcomputed tomography to investigate the relationship between altered placental vascular architecture and changes in UA wave reflection metrics. Fetuses were assessed at embryonic day (E) 15.5 and E17.5 in control C57BL6/J mice and dams treated with combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), a known model of fetal growth restriction. Whereas the reflection coefficient was not different between groups at E15.5, it was 27% higher at E17.5 in cART-treated mice compared with control mice. This increase in reflection coefficient corresponded to a 36% increase in the total number of vessel segments, a measure of overall architectural complexity. Interestingly, there was no difference in UA pulsatility index between groups, suggesting that the wave reflections convey information about vascular architecture that is not captured by conventional ultrasound metrics. The wave reflection parameters were found to be associated with the morphology of the fetoplacental arterial tree, with the area ratio between the UA and first branch points correlating with the reflection coefficient. This study highlights the potential for wave reflection to aid in the noninvasive clinical assessment of placental vascular pathology. NEW & NOTEWORTHY We used a novel ultrasound methodology based on detecting pulse pressure waves that propagate along the umbilical artery to investigate the relationship between changes in wave reflection metrics and altered placental vascular architecture visualized by microcomputed tomography. Using pregnant mice treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, a model of fetal growth restriction, we demonstrated that reflections in the umbilical artery are sensitive to placental vascular abnormalities and associated with the geometry of the fetoplacental tree.",Electrocardiography changes and their significance during treatment of patients with intermediate-high and high-risk pulmonary embolism.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30632764,European heart journal.

To extract useful information, e.g., about relevant states and important conformational transitions, a form of dimensionality reduction is required. Dimensionality reduction algorithms differ in their ability to efficiently project large amounts of data to an informative low-dimensional (low-d) representation and the way the low and high-d representations are linked. We propose a dimensionality reduction algorithm called EncoderMap that is based on a neural network autoencoder in combination with a nonlinear distance metric. A key advantage of this method is that it establishes a functional link from the high-d to the low-d representation and vice versa. This allows us not only to efficiently project data points to the low-d representation but also to generate high-d representatives for any point in the low-d map. The potential of the algorithm is demonstrated for molecular simulation data of a small, highly flexible peptide as well as for folding simulations of the 20-residue Trp-cage protein. We demonstrate that the algorithm is able to efficiently project the ensemble of high-d structures to a low-d map where major states can be identified and important conformational transitions are revealed. We also show that molecular conformations can be generated for any point or any connecting line between points on the low-d map. This ability of inverse mapping from the low-d to the high-d representation is particularly relevant for the use in algorithms that enhance the exploration of conformational space or the sampling of transitions between conformational states.",Three-Dimensional Porous Cobalt Phosphide Nanocubes Encapsulated in a Graphene Aerogel as an Advanced Anode with High Coulombic Efficiency for High-Energy Lithium-Ion Batteries.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30632744,ACS applied materials & interfaces,2019 02 15,"An ingeniously designed porous structure can synergistically optimize the desired properties and maximize the advantages of a material as an electrode for a high-performance energy storage system. The active material with a porous nanostructure could reduce the ion diffusion path and buffer the strain caused by the volume changes during cycling. Furthermore, combining the active material with a three-dimensional (3D) graphene aerogel (GA) matrix is an ideal way to maintain the structural integrity, improve the conductivity, and overcome the aggregation problem of the nanomaterials. Herein, we adopted a facile template-based strategy to derive a composite of 3D hierarchically porous cobalt phosphide nanocubes with a graphene aerogel (CoP@GA). The as-prepared CoP@GA features porous cobalt phosphide nanocubes that are firmly encapsulated and uniformly distributed in the well-defined graphene aerogel skeleton. Benefiting from the hierarchical porosity, structural integrity, and conductive network, the CoP@GA electrode manifests an ultrahigh initial Coulombic efficiency (88.6%), outstanding lithium storage performance in terms of excellent cycling performance (805.3 mAh·g-1 after 200 cycles at 200 mA·g-1), superior high-energy performance (351.8 mAh·g-1 after 4000 cycles at 10 A·g-1), and exceptional rate capability.

We have designed a Schottky junction gated silicon nanowire field-effect transistor (SiNW-SJGFET) sensor, where the Schottky junction replaces the noisy oxide/semiconductor interface. Our sensor exhibits significantly reduced device noise, 2.1 × 10-9 V2 μm2/Hz at 1 Hz, compared to reference devices with the oxide/semiconductor interface operated at both inversion and depletion modes. Further improvement can be anticipated by wrapping the nanowire by such a Schottky junction, thereby eliminating all oxide/semiconductor interfaces. Hence, a combination of the low-noise SiNW-SJGFET device with a sensing surface of the Nernstian response limit holds promises for future high signal-to-noise ratio sensor applications.",Metabolic Engineering Strategies Based on Secondary Messengers (p)ppGpp and C-di-GMP To Increase Erythromycin Yield in Saccharopolyspora erythraea.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30632732,ACS synthetic biology,2019 02 15,"Secondary messengers (such as (p)ppGpp and c-di-GMP) were proved to play important roles in antibiotic biosynthesis in actinobacteria. In this study, we found that transcription levels of erythromycin-biosynthetic ( ery) genes were upregulated in nutrient limitation, which depended on (p)ppGpp in Saccharopolyspora erythraea. Further study demonstrated that the expression of ery genes and intracellular concentrations of (p)ppGpp showed synchronization during culture process. The erythromycin yield was significantly improved (about 200%) by increasing intracellular concentration of (p)ppGpp through introduction of C-terminally truncated (p)ppGpp synthetase RelA (1.43 kb of the N-terminal segment) from Streptomyces coelicolor into S. erythraea strain NRRL2338 (named as WT/pIB-P BAD- relA1-489). As the intracellular concentration of (p)ppGpp in an industrial erythromycin-high-producing strain E3 was greatly higher (about 10- to 100-fold) than WT strain, the applications of the above-described strategy did not work in E3 strain. Further research revealed that low concentration of 2-oxoglutarate in E3 strain exerted a ""nitrogen-rich"" pseudosignal, leading to the downregulation of nitrogen metabolism genes, which limited the use of nitrogen sources and thus the high intracellular (p)ppGpp concentration. Furthermore, the secondary messenger, c-di-GMP, was proved to be able to activate ery genes transcription by enhancing binding of BldD to promoters of ery genes. Overexpressing the diguanylate cyclase CdgB from S. coelicolor in S. erythraea increased the intracellular c-di-GMP concentration, and improved erythromycin production. These findings demonstrated that increasing the concentration of intracellular secondary messengers can activate ery genes transcription, and provided new strategies for designing metabolic engineering based on secondary messengers to improve antibiotics yield in actinobacteria.",The Use of Soluble FMS-like Tyrosine Kinase 1/Placental Growth Factor Ratio in the Clinical Management of Pre-eclampsia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30632730,African journal of reproductive health,2019 04 10,"Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy in particular the category preeclampsia (PE), remains a major cause of both maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. Angiogenic growth factors (PlGF and VEGF) and their tyrosine kinase receptors -1 and 2 (Flt-1 and KDR) are involved in both fetal and placental development. Inadequate placentation and the consequent release of antiangiogenic soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 (sFlt-1) is thus instrumental in the etiology of this disease. sFlt-1 binds to both angiogenic growth factors and neutralizes their effect thereby creating an angiogenic imbalance. This imbalance is frequently reported in women diagnosed with preeclampsia occurring before the clinical manifestation of the disease. The recent prognostic value of the sFlt-1/PlGF ratio has received considerable attention as a risk indicator of preeclampsia development. The aim of this review is to highlight the current advances in the diagnostic utility of the sFlt-1/PlGF ratio with regards to preeclampsia development.","A Gap Analysis of Mother, New-born, and Child Health in West Africa with Reference to the Sustainable Development Goals 2030.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30632729,African journal of reproductive health,2019 04 10,"The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) comprises 15-member states with an estimated population of 350 million. This account relates the present status of maternal, neonatal, and under-five-mortality to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) targets set for 2030. For each SDG indicator, progress observed was compared with that needed to meet the target (assuming linear progression). The time gap was calculated as the difference between the time remaining to the target year (2030) and the estimated time needed to achieve the target. The highest maternal mortality ratio is found in Sierra Leone (1360 in 2015), followed by Nigeria (814) and Liberia (725). Whereas Sierra Leone and Nigeria keep high positions also for the neonatal and under-five mortality rate, Liberia ranks clearly better than the ECOWAS average. Globally skilled health professionals' density is 25 per 10,000 population and in Nigeria close to it with 20.1 whereas Guinea takes the last position with 1.4. The gap analysis shows that ECOWAS countries have a realistic chance to likely reach the SDG targets in 2030 with a delay of less than 4 years regarding maternal, neonatal, and under-five-mortality although their skilled health professionals' density is considerably lower than for the entire African region.","Evaluating the Reasons for Partial and Non-immunization of Children in Wushishi Local Government Area, Niger State, Nigeria: Methodological Comparison.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30632728,African journal of reproductive health,2019 04 10,"Immunization of children against childhood preventable diseases has remained one of the most important cost effective and public health strategies to reduce childhood preventable morbidity and mortalities arising from infectious diseases. A recent report released by World Health Organization (WHO) stated that 1 in 10 infants did not receive vaccination in 2016. Also, a survey conducted in Bida Emirate Area of Niger State Nigeria in 2015 found that full routine immunization coverage in this area was less than 30%. The aim of this study was to establish the full routine immunization status and the reasons for its partial and non-immunization of children in Wushishi Local Government Area using WHO recommended cluster survey method and contrast with Factor Analysis (FA) method to see if the same results were achieved. The findings showed that the full immunization status for this area was very low (36%) and the results of analysis of reasons for failure from both methods seem contradictory. However, it reflected that lack of proper information was strongest for both methods. The disparity obtained in the two methods might be a result of methodological issues. The health implication is that much is expected to be done in the area of enlightenment campaign of the need for immunization and the need to complete the required basic dose especially in the rural areas.",Postpartum Sexual Abstinence and its Implications for Under-Five Health Outcome among Childbearing Women in South-east Nigeria.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30632727,African journal of reproductive health,2019 04 10,"Abstinence from sexual intercourse after childbirth is a common practice deeply rooted in the cultures of different communities, including Nigeria with varying duration. Despite the high level of postpartum abstinence in the South-east compared to other neighbouring regions of Nigeria, under-five mortality is relatively higher in the South-east. This paper examined postpartum sexual abstinence as a predictive factor for under-five health outcome in Abia State with data from a sample of 609 childbearing women within 15-49 years. The mean duration of postpartum abstinence was 3.1±1.5 months; shorter in rural than urban areas with 2.7±1.4 and 3.5±1.3 months, respectively. The months of abstinence from sexual activity after childbirth is significantly related to experiences of under-five mortality and childhood diseases (p<0.05). The qualitative data showed that period of abstinence from sexual activity after childbirth is rooted in culture and was alluded to have great influence on under-five health outcomes. It is concluded that most women resumed sexual activity early after childbirth mostly to secure their marriages which affect their under-five children's health. Proper guidelines on resumption of sexual activity after childbirth to avoid its negative effects on under-five health outcome should be instituted to facilitate the achievement of sustainable development.",Differences in Cervical Cancer Screening Knowledge and Practices by HIV Status and Geographic Location: Implication for Program Implementation in Zambia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30632726,African journal of reproductive health,2019 04 10,"The knowledge and perceptions of cervical cancer among HIV negative and positive women, aged 25-49 years, from rural and urban locations in Zambia was systematically accessed in this study to determine any differences. Data were coded and analyzed using NVivo software. Compared to HIV negative women, HIV positive women had more accurate information about cervical cancer. They were more likely to cite male circumcision as the best approach to cervical cancer prevention. HPV infection was more commonly mentioned as a risk factor among HIV positive women. However, HIV positive women displayed little knowledge about HPV being the major cause of cervical cancer. Among HIV positive women, lack of time was the major screening barrier cited while HIV negative women mentioned being symptomatic as a determinant for early detection. Compared to rural residents, urban residents cited a wider range of cervical cancer information sources, including media and workplace although all of the participants who stated that they had no knowledge of cervical cancer were urban residents. Overall, knowledge and perceptions of cervical cancer among study participants was high, although differences exist between subgroups.

The purpose of this study was to determine the infant and child care-related experiences of mothers with disabilities in Turkey. A conventional content analysis was used in this qualitative design. Fourteen mothers with disabilities participated in semi-structured in-depth interviews consisting of open-ended questions about their infant and child care experiences. Three themes and eight subthemes emerged from the data analysis. The themes were: role fulfillment, barriers, and coping and support. All of the women said that they wanted to become mothers, and when they did so, they felt they had fulfilled their roles in society. However, there was a societal misconception that woman with disabilities 'could not give birth to children or would not properly care for them. Measures should be taken to eliminate negative social perceptions of mothers with disabilities. Public support should be provided to meet the needs of mothers with disabilities.","Deterrents to Immediate Antiretroviral Therapy Initiation by Pregnant Women Living with HIV in Hhohho Region, Swaziland.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30632724,African journal of reproductive health,2019 04 10,"Despite robust evidence that immediate antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation reduces transmission of HIV from mother to child, some pregnant women living with HIV in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), and Swaziland in particular, continue to refuse ART. This study explored the reasons which deter pregnant women living with HIV from immediate ART initiation in the Hhohho region, Swaziland, using grounded theory design. In-depth interviews with ten purposively selected pregnant women who refused immediate ART initiation were carried out in three high volume health facilities. The thematic analysis revealed key reasons that deterred women from immediate ART initiation. These were shock and perceived stigma, participants' conceptualisation of health and ART and the fear of ART and its side effects. The study offers qualitative evidence from Swaziland that might help illuminate issues that prevent pregnant women from accepting immediate ART initiation for their own health and that of their children. The evidence generated from this study can be used for developing targeted and culturally appropriate intervention strategies for Swazi women.",The Impact of Healthcare spending on Life Expectancy: Evidence from Selected West African Countries.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30632723,African journal of reproductive health,2019 04 10,"Increasing healthcare expenditure in West African countries cannot be over-emphasized. There is need for urgent improvement of healthcare, healthcare equipment and facilities, and human resources with qualified healthcare givers. It is important to have clarity on which healthcare sector to invest in, to maximize impact, effectiveness and efficiency. This study investigated the private, public, and public-private healthcare sectors of West Africa. Data was obtained from World Bank Indicators within the period of 16 years (from 1999 - 2014). Using pooled regression and pairwise correlation, empirical results were obtained. Female population lived longer than the male population and a positive relationship was obtained between the variables of healthcare spending and life expectancy for the public healthcare sector. The results showed a negative relationship between these variables for the private healthcare sector. The government, policy and decision-makers are recommended to focus on increasing the expenditure on the public healthcare system to achieve positive outcomes for increased life expectancy against other healthcare sectors that remain expensive and inaccessible to the population."

Thus, scaffold-free tissue-engineered structures can be a promising solution to overcome the issues associated with classical scaffold-based materials in clinical transplantation. The present study seeks to optimize the culture conditions and cell combinations used to generate scaffold-free structures using a Bio-3D printing system. Human cartilage cells, human fibroblasts, human umbilical vein endothelial cells, and human mesenchymal stem cells from bone marrow are aggregated into spheroids and placed into a Bio-3D printing system with dedicated needles positioned according to 3D configuration data, to develop scaffold-free trachea-like tubes. Culturing the Bio-3D-printed structures with proper flow of specific medium in a bioreactor facilitates the rearrangement and self-organization of cells, improving physical strength and tissue function. The Bio-3D-printed tissue forms small-diameter trachea-like tubes that are implanted into rats with the support of catheters. It is confirmed that the tubes are viable in vivo and that the tracheal epithelium and capillaries proliferate.

Recently, it has been demonstrated this collaboration also takes place during fibrotic diseases, where TGF-β1 activates the WNT/β-catenin pathway that results in dedifferentiation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts, increased production of extracellular matrix components and fibrosis. Independent studies show the functions of these molecules during the development of the inner ears in several different species. However, little is known about the collaboration between TGF-β1 and WNT in the injured inner ear and particularly how this collaboration affects the fibrotic process that often occurs following cochlear implantation. First, we used a cochlear explant model to study the effect of electrode insertion trauma and TGF-β1 signaling in activation of the WNT pathway. Finally, adult TopGal mutant mice were used in vivo to track the activation of the WNT/β-catenin in response to EIT. A chronic inflammatory response, increased cell proliferation and tissue remodeling are hallmarks of fibrotic disease. This study explores and highlights the collaboration between the TGF-β1 and WNT pathways in the trauma-initiated fibrotic process within the implanted cochlea. WNT signaling is involved in the development of the inner ear and therefore a potential target in hair cell regeneration therapies. However, in light of our observations from the current study, manipulation of the WNT pathway by gene therapy techniques in the pathological ear seems a very complex process with an increased risk of inducing excessive fibrosis thereby compromising the efficacy of implant function.

In four countries (Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and Iceland), we collected consecutive series of cervical cancers (n = 639) and high-grade precancerous cervical lesions (n = 1240) during 2004-2006 before implementation of HPV vaccination and subjected the specimens to standardized HPV genotyping. The HPV prevalence was 82.7% (95% confidence interval [CI] 79.0-86.4) in CIN2, 91.6% (95% CI 89.7-93.5) in CIN3, and 86.4% (95% CI 83.7-89.1) in cervical cancer.

Due to the presence of a basal stem cell niche, the adult mammalian OE is a dynamic tissue capable of replacing neurons following their loss. Nonetheless, certain conditions, such as blunt head trauma, can result in persistent olfactory loss, thought to be due to shearing of olfactory nerve filaments at the skull base, degeneration, and failures in proper regeneration/reinnervation. The identification of new treatment strategies aimed at preventing degeneration of olfactory neurons is, therefore, needed. In considering potential therapies, we have focused on N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a glutathione substrate shown to be neuroprotective, with a record of safe clinical use. Here, we have tested the use of NAC in an animal model of olfactory degeneration. Administered acutely, we found that NAC (100 mg/kg, twice daily) resulted in a reduction of olfactory neuronal loss from the OE of the nose following surgical ablation of the olfactory bulb. At 1 week postlesion, we identified 54 ± 8.1 mature neurons per 0.5 mm epithelium in NAC-treated animals vs. 28 ± 4.2 in vehicle-treated controls (P = 0.02). Furthermore, in an olfactory cell culture model, we have identified significant alterations in the expression of several genes involved in oxidative stress pathways following NAC exposure. Our results provide evidence supporting the potential therapeutic utility for NAC acutely following head trauma-induced olfactory loss.

An increasing number of studies has demonstrated that elevated production of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) under low oxygen conditions plays a regulatory role in modulating cellular responses for adaptation to hypoxia. To learn more about this process in A. fumigatus, intracellular ROS production during hypoxia has been determined. The results confirm increased amounts of intracellular ROS in A. fumigatus exposed to decreased oxygen levels. Moreover, nuclear accumulation of the major oxidative stress regulator AfYap1 is observed after low oxygen cultivation. For further analysis, iodoTMT labeling of redox-sensitive cysteine residues is applied to identify proteins that are reversibly oxidized. This analysis reveals that proteins with important roles in maintaining redox balance and protein folding, such as the thioredoxin Asp f 29 and the disulfide-isomerase PdiA, undergo substantial thiol modification under hypoxia. The data also show that the mitochondrial respiratory complex IV assembly protein Coa6 is significantly oxidized by hypoxic ROS. Deletion of the corresponding gene results in a complete absence of hypoxic growth, indicating the importance of complex IV during adaptation of A. fumigatus to oxygen-limiting conditions.","Molecular insights into the mechanism of 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase inhibition: enzyme kinetics, X-ray crystallography and computational simulations.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30632699,The FEBS journal,2019 03 04,"Slow-binding inhibitors with long residence time on the target often display superior efficacy in vivo. Rationally designing inhibitors with low off-target rates is restricted by a limited understanding of the structural basis of slow-binding inhibition kinetics in enzyme-drug interactions. 4-Hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPPD) is an important target for drug and herbicide development. Although the time-dependent behavior of HPPD inhibitors has been studied for decades, its structural basis and mechanism remain unclear. Herein, we report a detailed experimental and computational study that explores structures for illustrating the slow-binding inhibition kinetics of HPPD. We observed the conformational change of Phe428 at the C-terminal α-helix in the inhibitor-bound structures and further identified that the inhibition kinetics of drugs are related to steric hindrance of Phe428. These detailed structural and mechanistic insights illustrate that steric hindrance is highly associated with the time-dependent behavior of HPPD inhibitors. These findings may enable rational design of new potent HPPD-targeted drugs or herbicides with longer target residence time and improved properties.

The aim of this study is to assess the associations between different symptoms related to PVD and the risk of developing retinal tears. A systematic review of articles written in English, using MEDLINE, Embase (via Embase.com) and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (1996-2017) was conducted. Search terms included five elements: PVD, retinal tears, retinal detachment, floaters and flashes. Independent extraction of articles was conducted by two authors using predefined data fields, including study quality indicators. Thirteen studies fulfilled the selection criteria. Analysis of pooled data revealed that presence of isolated flashes was associated with the development of retinal tears in 5.3% of symptomatic eyes [mean 2.9 eyes; 95% CI (2.1, 5.7)].Conversely, floaters alone had a stronger association with retinal tears (16.5% of eyes), as compared to flashes. The association to retinal tears was even greater for those patients reporting both flashes and floaters [mean 17.8 eyes (20.0%); 95% CI (17.4, 18.1)]. Retinal and/or vitreous haemorrhage was also associated with the presence and later development of retinal tears [mean 12.5 eyes (30.0%); 95% CI (11.7, 13.9)]. Patients with more than 10 floaters or a cloud in their vision had a high risk of developing retinal tears (OR19.8, p-value 0.032). In the setting of a PVD, the onset of flashes and floaters, and the presence of retinal and/or vitreous haemorrhage are risk factors for the development of retinal tears. The association is greater when both symptoms are present, and even greater when the patient reports more than 10 floaters, a curtain or a cloud and/or there is a positive finding of a vitreous or retinal haemorrhage. This study supports the necessity of an immediate examination of patients presenting with symptoms related to a PVD, and a follow-up examination might be prudent in a subgroup of these patients."

The models presented here can be used as an approach in the screening and prioritization of chemicals in a scientific and regulatory frame and for toxicity prediction.",Urinary Proteomics and Precision Medicine for Chronic Kidney Disease: Current Status and Future Perspectives.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30632676,Proteomics. Clinical applications,2019 05 02,"Precision medicine is since long an ongoing refinement of classical medicine, integrating improved and more detailed pathophysiological understanding with rapid technological advances. In the heterogenous area of chronic kidney disease there seems to be a high potential for the improvement in treatment and prognosis for several causes, with new technologies under development, that are yet to be introduced in clinical practice. As in other medical disciplines, investigation of abundant peptide patterns (proteomics) has gained recent interest. Especially relevant for kidney disease, urinary proteomics may provide both improved diagnosis and, as reviewed here, also holds promise for personalized treatment in the future. So far, capillary electrophoresis coupled to mass spectrometry (CE-MS) is the most widely applied technique, and in addition to several cross-sectional and cohort studies, there is even an ongoing randomized controlled trial that will soon report on the concept used as a method of personalizing treatment. In addition, there is hope that urinary proteomics can turn into a ""liquid biopsy,"" replacing the invasive diagnostic procedure. The next couple of years will provide more answers on the topic.",Activation of AMPK alleviates cardiopulmonary bypass-induced cardiac injury via ameliorating acute cardiac glucose metabolic disorder.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30632675,Cardiovascular therapeutics,2019 03 14,"Recent years, studies have demonstrated that hyperglycemia is one of the main manifestations after cardiac surgeries, which contributes to myocardial injuries and increases the chance of subsequent complications and mortality in such patients. However, strategies targeting at glucose metabolic disorder after cardiac surgeries to attenuate myocardial injuries are inadequately studied. In this study, a rat model of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) was applied to investigate the role of Adenosine 5'-monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in modulating myocardial glucose metabolic-induced cardiac injuries after cardiac surgery. The results revealed that CPB elicited significant cardiac dysfunction, and pronouncedly elevated the markers of myocardial injuries including serum creatine kinase MB and cardiac troponin I. Additionally, blunted myocardial glucose uptake after CPB was associated with decreased membrane glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) content. However, pretreatment of AMPK agonist 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide1-β-D-ribofuranoside (AICAR) at the beginning of CPB activated AMPK, enhanced phosphorylation of Akt substrate 160 (AS160), and increased myocardial membrane content of GLUT4. Meanwhile, improved myocardial glucose uptake and more importantly alleviated cardiac injury were also observed after CPB pretreated with AICAR. Moreover, the application of a mutant form of AS160 (AS160-4P) abolished the beneficial effect of AICAR, as evidenced by impaired cardiac glucose uptake, reduced myocardial membrane GLUT-4 translocation, increased cardiac injury markers, and deterioration of cardiac function after CPB. In conclusion, it was suggested in this study that preactivation of AMPK by AICAR improved myocardial glucose uptake by promoting AS160 dependent myocardial membrane GLUT-4 translocation, which ultimately provided a potent cardioprotective effect.",Urinary Peptidomic Biomarker for Personalized Prevention and Treatment of Diastolic Left Ventricular Dysfunction.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30632674,Proteomics. Clinical applications,2019 06 10,"Diastolic heart failure (DHF) is characterized by slow left ventricular (LV) relaxation, increased LV stiffness, interstitial deposition of collagen, and a modified extracellular matrix proteins. Among Europeans, the frequency of asymptomatic diastolic LV dysfunction (DD) is 25%. This constitutes a large pool of people at high risk of DHF. The goal of this review was to describe the discovery and the initial validation of new multidimensional urinary peptidomic biomarkers (UPB) indicative of DD, mainly consisting of collagen fragments, and to describe a roadmap for their introduction into clinical practice. The availability of new drugs creates a window of opportunity for mounting a randomized clinical trial consolidating the clinical applicability of UPB to screen for DD. If successfully completed, such trial will benefit ≈25% of all people older than 50 years and open a large market for a UPB diagnostic tool and the drug tested. Moreover, sequenced peptides making up UPB will generate novel insights in the pathophysiology of DD and facilitate personalized treatment of patients with DHF for whom prevention came too late. If proven cost-effective, the clinical application of UPB will contribute to the sustainability of health care in aging population in epidemiologic transition.",Five-year results of small incision lenticule extraction (SMILE) and femtosecond laser LASIK (FS-LASIK) for myopia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30632671,Acta ophthalmologica,2019 04 24,To compare visual outcomes and aberration outcomes in small incision lenticule extraction (SMILE) versus femtosecond laser LASIK (FS-LASIK).,Proteomic Analysis of Endothelial Cells Exposed to Ultrasmall Nanoparticles Reveals Disruption in Paracellular and Transcellular Transport.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30632670,Proteomics,2019 03 04,"The large interactive surfaces of nanoparticles (NPs) increase the opportunities to develop NPs for vascular targeting. Proteomic analysis of endothelial cells exposed to NPs reveals the cellular response and turns the focus into the impairment of the endothelial permeability. Here, quantitative proteomics and transcriptome sequencing are combined to evaluate the effects of exposure to sub-lethal concentrations of TiO2 -USNPs and TiO2 -NPs on human dermal microvascular endothelial cells. Endothelial cells react to preserve the semi-permeable properties that are essential for vascular tissue fluid homeostasis, vascular development, and angiogenesis. The main impact of the exposure was alteration of functional complexes involved in cell adhesion, vesicular transport, and cytoskeletal structure. Those are the core cellular structures that are linked to the permeability and the integrity of the endothelial tissue. Moreover, the extracellular proteins uptake along wih the NPs into the endothelial cells escape the lysosomal degradation pathway. These findings improve the understanding of the interaction of NPs with endothelial cell. The effects of the studied NPs modulating cell-cell adhesion and vesicular transport can help to evaluate the distribution of NPs via intravenous administration.","UNC5D, suppressed by promoter hypermethylation, inhibits cell metastasis by activating death-associated protein kinase 1 in prostate cancer.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30632669,Cancer science,2019 04 16,"Prostate cancer (PCa) death primarily occurs due to metastasis of the cells, but little is known about the underlying molecular mechanisms. This study aimed to evaluate the expression of UNC5D, a newly identified tumor suppressor gene, analyze its epigenetic alterations, and elucidate its functional relevance to PCa metastasis. Meta-analysis of publicly available microarray datasets revealed that UNC5D expression was frequently downregulated in PCa tissues and inversely associated with PCa metastasis. These results were verified in clinical specimens by real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry assays. Through methylation analysis, the downregulated expression of UNC5D in PCa tissues and cell lines was found to be attributable to the hypermethylation of the promoter. A negative correlation was observed between methylation and UNC5D mRNA expression in PCa samples. The ectopic expression of UNC5D in PCa cells effectively reduced their ability to migrate and invade both in vitro and in vivo, and siRNA-mediated knockdown of UNC5D yielded consistent results. UNC5D can recruit and activate death-associated protein kinase 1, which remained to be essential for its metastatic suppressor function. In conclusion, these results suggested that UNC5D as a novel putative metastatic suppressor gene that is commonly down-regulated by hypermethylation in PCa.",Photoresponsive Circular Supramolecular Polymers: A Topological Trap and Photoinduced Ring-Opening Elongation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30632667,Angewandte Chemie (International ed. in English),2019 03 13,"Topological features of one-dimensional macromolecular chains govern the properties and functionality of natural and synthetic polymers. To address this issue in supramolecular polymers, we synthesized two topologically distinct supramolecular polymers with intrinsic curvature, circular and helically folded nanofibers, from azobenzene-functionalized supramolecular rosettes. When a mixture of circular and helically folded nanofibers was exposed to UV light, selective unfolding of the latter open-ended supramolecular polymers was observed as a result of the curvature-impairing internal force produced by the trans-to-cis photoisomerization of the azobenzene. This distinct sensitivity suggests that the topological features of supramolecular polymers define their mechanical stability. Furthermore, the exposure of circular supramolecular polymers in more polar media to UV irradiation resulted in ring opening followed by chain elongation, thus demonstrating that the circular supramolecular polymer can function as a topological kinetic trap.",Training and evaluation of professors of dentistry in postgraduate programmes in Brazil.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30632666,European journal of dental education : official journal of the Association for Dental Education in Europe,2019 04 10,"In Brazil, the undergraduate dental education still remains fragmented and dissociated from its social context, with emphasis on the individualistic and private aspects of dental health.

However, the mechanism of the regenerative capacity of alveolar epithelial cells is unknown. Using a lung injury mouse model induced by hemorrhagic shock and LPS, a protein mass spectrometry-based high-throughput screening and linage tracing technology to mark alveolar epithelial type 2 cells (AEC2s), we analyzed the mechanism of alveolar epithelial cells proliferation. We demonstrated that the expression of Hippo-YAP1 (Yes-associated protein 1) key proteins were highly consistent with the regularity of the proliferation of alveolar epithelial type 2 cells after ALI. Furthermore, the results showed that YAP1-positive cells in lung tissue after ALI were mainly Sftpc lineage-labeled AEC2s. An in vitro proliferation assay of AEC2s demonstrated that AEC2 proliferation was significantly inhibited by both YAP1 siRNA and Hippo inhibitor. These findings revealed that YAP functioned as a key regulator to promote AEC2s proliferation, with the Hippo signaling pathway playing a pivotal role in this process.","The established electrocardiographic classification of anterior wall myocardial infarction misguides clinicians in terms of infarct location, extent and prognosis.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30632651,"Annals of noninvasive electrocardiology : the official journal of the International Society for Holter and Noninvasive Electrocardiology, Inc",2019 04 22,"The currently used scheme for the classification of infarct location and extent in anterior myocardial infarction (MI) is intuitive rather than being evidence-based, and recent evidence suggests that it may be misleading both in anatomic and prognostic sense.",C-reactive protein (CRP) rs3093059C predicts poor mizolastine response in chronic spontaneous urticaria patients with elevated serum CRP level.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30632650,Experimental dermatology,2019 03 13,"Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is a frequent disorder with recurrent itchy wheals and/or angioedema, and nearly 35% patients respond poorly to non-sedating H1 antihistamine treatment. CRP gene encodes the C-reactive protein, which is involved in the pathogenesis of CSU. To investigate the impacts of CRP polymorphisms on the susceptibility and therapeutic efficacy in the South Han CSU patients, we enrolled 145 CSU patients in our study. After 4-week non-sedating H1 antihistamine monotherapy treatment, more than 50% reduction of the severity score is considered as effective, or else non-effective. The CRP rs3093059T/C and rs2794521G/A genotypes of patients were determined by Sequenom MassARRAY. Functional studies including relative luciferase assay and β-hexosaminidase assay were conducted in HEK293T cells or RBL-2H3 cells to explore the function of variants. Forty (62.50%) CSU patients were effective when treated with mizolastine, and 55 (72.4%) patients were effective in the desloratadine group. We found that the patients carried with rs3093059TT genotype were significantly associated with good response (OR = 4.20, P = 0.015), had lower serum CRP, IL-6 and TNF-α levels than the CT/CC genotypes. In vitro, the rs3093059C allele exhibited significantly higher luciferase activity than wild allele (P < 0.001). From the β-hexosaminidase assay, we observed the inhibiting degranulation effects by mizolastine and this effect is weakened when with a higher dose CRP in RBL-2H3 cells. Our findings suggested that CSU patients carrying the rs3093059C allele may respond poorly to mizolastine with elevated serum CRP level.",A Visible-Near-Infrared Light-Responsive Host-Guest Pair with Nanomolar Affinity in Water.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30632649,"Chemistry (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)",2019 03 13,"The discovery of stimuli-responsive high affinity host-guest pairs with potential applications under biologically relevant conditions is a challenging goal. This work reports a high-affinity 1:1 complex formed between cucurbit[8]uril and a water-soluble photochromic diarylethene derivative. It was found that, by confining the open isomer within the cavity of the receptor, a redshift in the absorption spectrum and an enhancement of the photocyclization quantum yield from Φ=0.04 to Φ=0.32 were induced. This improvement in the photochemical performance enables quantitative photocyclization with visible light that, together with the near-infrared light-induced ring-opening reaction and the 100-fold selectivity for the closed isomer, confirms this as an outstanding light-responsive affinity pair.","ER stress differentially affects pro-inflammatory changes induced by mitochondrial dysfunction in the human monocytic leukemia cell line, THP-1.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30632648,Cell biology international,2019 05 31,"The functional and physical interaction between mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) has been the subject of intense study. To test the effect of this interaction on macrophage inflammatory activation, the human macrophage-like monocytic leukemia cell line THP-1 was treated with oligomycin, rotenone, or sodium azide, which induce mitochondrial dysfunction (MD) by blocking the electron transport chain (ETC). MD induced by these agents triggered activation of various sensors and markers of ER stress. This linkage affected macrophage function since LPS-induced expression of IL-23 was enhanced by the MD inducers, and this enhancing effect was abolished by inhibition of pancreatic endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) activity. This MD-mediated ER stress may be universal since it was observed in human embryonic kidney HEK293 cells and colon cancer SW480 cells. On the other hand, MD regulated LPS-induced activation of the AKT/GSK3β/β-catenin pathway in a manner not affected by inhibition of PERK or inositol-requiring enzyme 1α (IRE1α) activities. These results indicate that the occurrence of MD can lead to ER stress and these two events, separately or in combination, can affect various cellular processes.",GEN-27 exhibits anti-inflammatory effects by suppressing the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome and NF-κB pathway.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30632647,Cell biology international,2019 01 11,"Prolonged inflammation and deregulated cytokine production are associated with diversified inflammatory diseases. Genistein (GEN), the active and predominant isoflavonoid in dietary soybean, possesses anti-inflammatory activity. Our study aimed to assess the anti-inflammatory effects of GEN-27, a derivative of GEN, as well as explore the potential molecular mechanisms using lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced RAW264.7 cells. In our study, we demonstrated that GEN-27 administration (1, 5, or 10 µM) dose-dependently inhibited nitrite and nitric oxide (NO) levels in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells. Also, GEN-27 suppressed the release of LPS-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines including tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and IL-18. Moreover, GEN-27 attenuated LPS-induced inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expressions at mRNA and protein levels, and reversed the promoter activity of iNOS in RAW264.7 cells. Mechanistically, GEN-27 abated LPS-induced ROS production, as well as mitigated LPS-induced increase of caspase 1 activity and the protein levels of NOD-like receptor 3 (NLRP3), anti-apoptosis-associated speck-like protein-containing a CRAD (ASC), and Caspase 1 in RAW264.7 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Similarly, GEN-27 dose-dependently weakened adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-induced NLRP3, and IL-1β in RAW264.7 cells. In addition, GEN-27 treatment significantly suppressed LPS-induced phosphorylation of NF-κB p65, and alleviated LPS-induced increase of transcriptional activity of NF-κB in RAW264.7 cells. In summary, these results revealed that GEN-27 exhibited anti-inflammatory effects by suppressing the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome and NF-κB pathway, suggesting that GEN-27 may be served as a promising therapeutic agent for the prevention and therapy of inflammatory-associated diseases.",IL-1β functionally attenuates ABCG2 and PDZK1 expression in HK-2 cells partially through NF-ĸB activation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30632646,Cell biology international,2019 05 31,"Long-standing untreated hyperuricemia could lead to gout. Several recent studies have demonstrated a significant decrease of serum urate during acute gout attack, which is an aseptic inflammation process focusing on IL-1β. However, how IL-1β, by itself, alters the expression and the functional activity of urate transporters in renal tubular epithelial cells is still unclear. Herein, we revealed that IL-1β could attenuate the mRNA and protein levels of ABCG2, a major urate efflux pump, in HK-2 cells by real-time PCR and Western-blot assays. Moreover, using an ABCG2 specific inhibitor and a new sensitive and specific detection system, it was found that IL-1β also reduced the ABCG2 transporter activities. Incubation with specific inhibitors of the NF-κB pathway partly dampened the inhibitory effect of IL-1β on ABCG2, indicating that IL-1β reduced the ABCG2 expression partially through the NF-ĸB pathway. Furthermore, the decreased expression of PDZK1 induced by IL-1β, which is dependent on the NF-κB pathway, could account for the imbalance between the functions and expressions of ABCG2 on this status. These findings demonstrated a new role for IL-1β, whereby it leads to the inhibition of ABCG2 in renal tubular epithelial cells; this new role probably does not encompass its involvement in the process of renal urate excretion mediated by inflammation. Therefore, other regulation mechanisms of urate reabsorption in renal tubular epithelial cells deserve to be examined in further studies.",Breast MRI screening for average-risk women: A monte carlo simulation cost-benefit analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30632645,Journal of magnetic resonance imaging : JMRI,2019 06 05,"Screening high-risk women for breast cancer with MRI is cost-effective, with increasing cost-effectiveness paralleling increasing risk.

However, its precise mechanism of action remains unclear. Since insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) signaling and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt (PI3K/Akt) signaling have been shown to play a pivotal role in regulating osteogenesis, we hypothesized that the osteogenic activity of calycosin is mediated by these signaling pathways. Rat calvarial osteoblasts (ROBs) were cultured in osteogenic medium containing calycosin with or without GSK1904529A (GSK) or LY294002 (LY) (inhibitors of IGF1R and PI3K, respectively). The effects on cell proliferation, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, calcified nodules, mRNA or protein expression of osteogenic genes [alkaline phosphatase (Alpl), collagen type I (Col1a1), runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2), Osterix, and bone morphogenetic protein 2 (Bmp2)], and phosphorylation of IGF1R and Akt were examined. The present results showed that calycosin enhanced cell proliferation, ALP activity and Alizarin Red-S staining in a dose-dependent manner in the range of 10-8 -10-6  M, while an inhibitory effect was observed at 10-5  M. Treatment at the optimal concentration (10-6  M, a physiologically achievable concentration) increased mRNA levels of osteogenic genes and phosphorylation of IGF1R and Akt. Furthermore, treatment with GSK or LY partly reversed the effects of calycosin on ROBs, as indicated by the decreases in calycosin-induced ALP activity, calcified nodules and osteogenic gene expression. These results suggest that the osteogenic effect of calycosin partly involves the IGF1R/PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.",Nanoscale Archimedean Tilings Formed by 3-Miktoarm Star Terpolymer Thin Films.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30632643,Macromolecular rapid communications,2019 04 04,"3-Miktoarm star terpolymer architecture (3µ-ABC), consisting of three dissimilar polymer chains, A, B, and C connected at a junction point, provides a unique opportunity in the design of complex nanoscale patterns such as Archimedean tilings that are not accessible from linear ABC terpolymers. In this work, the synthesis and the self-assembly of 3-miktoarm star terpolymers, namely, polystyrene-arm-poly(2-vinylpyridine)-arm-polyisoprene (3µ-SPI) into Archimedean tiling patterns is described. Several 3µ-SPI terpolymers are produced via a mid-functional PS-b-P2VP, synthesized by sequential anionic polymerization, using a 1,1-diphenylethylene bearing a tert-butyldimethylsilyl-protected hydroxyl functionality as a core molecule. PI arms with different sizes are then linked to the deprotected hydroxyl function of the core molecule via a Steglich esterification. Solvent-annealed 3µ-SPI thin films exhibit nanoscale prisms arranged into a (4.6.12) Archimedean tiling pattern. Depending on the size of the low etch-resistant PI arm and the solvent selected to promote the self-assembly of 3µ-SPI thin films, the voided columns occupy the square or decagonal sites of the (4.6.12) pattern. The use of this (4.6.12) tiling produced for the first time from self-assembled 3µ-ABC thin films can be a promising route to build 2D photonic crystals having complete photonic band gaps, where the light propagation is completely prohibited."

Vinblastine (VBL) is a naturally occurring alkaloid prescribed to cancer patients. Many cancer patients treated with VBL were taking CAP at the same time. This study attempted to investigate the effect of CAP on the pharmacokinetics of VBL, which is the substrate of CYP3A, P-gp, and Mrp2. CAP, cyclosporine (CsA) or olive oil was given to rats for seven consecutive days, and on the seventh day, VBL (1.3 mg/kg) was administered intravenously. CsA was used as a CYP3A1/2 and transporter inhibitor, and olive oil was used as a vehicle. The results showed that pretreatment of rats with CAP (3.0 mg/kg) for seven consecutive days resulted in an increase in the AUC0-t of VBL of about 29.8% (P < 0.05) compared with the control group. Moreover, CAP decreased the CL of VBL to 75.5% (P < 0.05). At this time, CYP3A1/2 and Mrp2/Abcc2 in the liver was decreased at the mRNA and protein levels. These results demonstrate that chronic ingestion of CAP will increase systemic exposure and reduce clearance of VBL in rats. The food-drug interaction between CAP and VBL appears to be due to modulation of CYP3A1/2 and Mpr2 expression by CAP.",A liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry approach for study the tissue distributions of five components of crude and salt-processed Radix Achyranthes in rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30632626,Biomedical chromatography : BMC,2019 06 13,"This study developed a robust and reliable approach using liquid chromatography- tandem mass spectrometry for the simultaneous determination of five saponins in rat tissues: β-ecdysterone, chikusetsusaponin IV, ginsenoside Ro, 25S-inokosterone and chikusetsusaponin IVa. This is the first report on a comparative tissue distribution study of crude and salt-processed Radix Achyranthes in rats. After one-step protein precipitation by acetonitrile, the tissue samples were sent to LC-MS/MS for multiple reaction monitoring. The retention times of the five saponins and internal standard were 1.77, 3.14, 3.01, 1.83, 3.26 and 4.77 min.

The models were validated by R, R2 , RA2 , variance inflation factor, F, and P values testing and residual analysis. It was concluded from the models that the 13 C NMR chemical shifts of C8, C10, C7, and the 1 H NMR chemical shifts of Ha contributed positively to the activity against Fusarium graminearum, Botrytis cinerea, Colletotrichum capsici, and Rhizoctonia cerealis, respectively.

Implications of this extension include capturing an older cohort of patients with ARFID accessing care at eating disorders clinics, as well as providing a diagnostic home to previously orphaned pediatric subgroups with feeding disorders that lacked a diagnostic home prior to DSM-5. While recognizing notable strengths of this now 5-year-old diagnostic entity, ARFID is largely recognized as a very heterogeneous condition that lacks specificity to best guide clinical and research activities. The current commentary discusses the implications of ARFID as a replacement and extension of the DSM-IV diagnosis of feeding disorder of infancy or early childhood and provides the rationale and guidance for developing a subtype taxonomy.",Allogeneic CAR T cell therapies for leukemia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30632623,American journal of hematology,2019 04 15,"Allogeneic chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR T) cells can offer advantages over autologous T cell therapies, including the availability of ""fit"" cells for production, and elimination of risks associated with inadvertent transduction of leukemic blasts. However, allogeneic T cell therapies must address HLA barriers and conventionally rely on the availability of a suitable HLA-matched donor if graft-vs-host-disease and rejection effects are to be avoided. More recently, the incorporation of additional genome editing manipulations, to disrupt T cell receptor expression and address other critical pathways have been explored. Clinical trials are underway investigating non-HLA matched T cells expressing anti-CD19 CARs for the treatment of B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) and anti-CD123 CAR for acute myeloid leukemia (AML).

Multifocal chronic inflammatory lesions displaced structures in all affected organs. Mortalities commenced on completion of spawning in May and were evenly distributed over the second year in the temperature range 11-15°C. The main systemic infection causing agent was initially identified based on morphological characteristics as an Exophiala species. Ribosomal DNA (rDNA) ITS regions of the isolates were subsequently sequenced confirming the isolates belonged to Exophiala genus. All isolates fell in a single phylogenetic cluster, which is represented by Exophiala angulospora. Fish were treated with either formalin or Bronopol or a combination of both, but there was no effect on the pattern or numbers of mortalities. Isolates were also tested against three different concentrations of Latrunculin A, Amphotericin B and Itraconazole with no success. It is of utmost importance to increase the knowledge on pathogen-host interactions to successfully develop sustainable control methods."

The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical characteristics and prognostic value of GPNMB expression in tumor tissue derived from a cohort of patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). GPNMB expression in human HNSCC, oral dysplasia and normal mucosal tissue was evaluated by immunohistochemistry (IHC). The correlations of GPNMB expression with the clinical characteristics of HNSCC were assessed by one-way ANOVA and t test analyses. Survival data were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier analysis and the Cox proportional hazards model. GPNMB was highly expressed in HNSCC tissue compared with dysplasia and normal mucosal tissue. Additionally, a high level of GPNMB expression in HNSCC was associated with poor prognosis (P<0.01). In the analysis of tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) staging, a high GPNMB expression level in HNSCC tissue, as well as metastatic lymph node tissue, correlated with an advanced N stage. In conclusion, GPNMB was overexpressed in human HNSCC tissue and predicted poor prognosis in human HNSCC tissue. In addition, GPNMB expression was closely correlated with N stage in patients with HNSCC.","Cadmium in plants: uptake, toxicity, and its interactions with selenium fertilizers.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30632600,Metallomics : integrated biometal science,2019 02 20,"Cd is the third major contaminant of greatest hazard to the environment after mercury and lead and is considered as the only metal that poses health risks to both humans and animals at plant tissue concentrations that are generally not phytotoxic. Cd accumulation in plant shoots depends on Cd entry through the roots, sequestration within root vacuoles, translocation in the xylem and phloem, and Cd dilution within the plant shoot throughout its growth. Several metal transporters, processes, and channels are involved from the first step of Cd reaching the root cells and until its final accumulation in the edible parts of the plant. It is hard to demonstrate one step as the pivotal factor to decide the Cd tolerance or accumulation ability of plants since the role of a specific transporter/process varies among plant species and even cultivars. In this review, we discuss the sources of Cd pollutants, Cd toxicity to plants, and mechanisms of Cd uptake and redistribution in plant tissues. The metal transporters involved in Cd transport within plant tissues are also discussed and how their manipulation can control Cd uptake and/or translocation. Finally, we discuss the beneficial effects of Se on plants under Cd stress, and how it can minimize or mitigate Cd toxicity in plants.",Label-free enrichment of primary human skeletal progenitor cells using deterministic lateral displacement.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30632599,Lab on a chip,2019 04 16,"Skeletal stem cells (SSCs) are present in bone marrow (BM) and offer great potential for bone regenerative therapies. However, in the absence of a unique marker, current sorting approaches remain challenging in the quest for simple strategies to deliver SSCs with consistent regeneration and differentiation capacities. Microfluidics offers the possibility to sort cells marker-free, based on intrinsic biophysical properties. Recent studies indicate that SSCs are stiffer than leukocytes and are contained within the larger cell fraction in BM. This paper describes the use of deterministic lateral displacement (DLD) to sort SSCs based on cell size and stiffness. DLD is a technology that uses arrays of micropillars to sort cells based on their diameter. Cell deformation within the device can change the cell size and affect sorting - here evidenced using human cell lines and by fractionation of expanded SSCs. Following sorting, SSCs remained viable and retained their capacity to form clonogenic cultures (CFU-F), indicative of stem cell potential. Additionally, larger BM cells showed enhanced capacity to form CFU-F. These findings support the theory that SSCs are more abundant within the larger BM cell fraction and that DLD, or other size-based approaches, could be used to provide enriched SSC populations with significant implications for stem cell research and translation to the clinic.","Impact of traffic volumes on levels, patterns, and toxicity of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in roadside soils.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30632598,Environmental science. Processes & impacts,2019 03 05,"Vehicular exhaust is one of the important sources of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in urban areas, and roadside soils can be directly contaminated with PAHs released from traffic emissions. In this study, roadside soils were collected at 10 sites in Ulsan, the largest industrial city in South Korea, to investigate the relationship between the traffic volume and the contamination characteristics of PAHs. The total concentrations of 16 US EPA priority PAHs (∑16 PAHs, mean: 1079 ng g-1) and organic-matter-normalized ∑16 PAHs (mean: 224 ng g-1 OM) were positively correlated with traffic volumes (Pearson correlation, r = 0.88 and 0.78, p < 0.01). The levels of carcinogenic PAHs were significantly higher at the high traffic sites than at the low traffic sites. High traffic sites (>25 000 vehicles per day) located at intersections showed elevated concentrations of indicator compounds (e.g., phenanthrene, fluoranthene, pyrene, and benzo[ghi]perylene) for gasoline and diesel exhaust. The diagnostic ratios also suggested a strong influence of the traffic emissions on the roadside soils, not only at urban sites but also at rural ones. Consequently, roadside soils and road dust (which are expected to be much more contaminated with PAHs than roadside soil) can act as important non-point sources of air and water pollution. The cancer risk from exposure to PAHs in the roadside soils was in an acceptable range, but continuous monitoring is required to evaluate the influence of increasing traffic on the environment and human health.",Identification of a new natural gastric lipase inhibitor from star anise.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30632597,Food & function,2019 04 09,"The identification and isolation of bioactive compounds are of great interest in the drug delivery field, despite being a difficult task. We describe here an innovative strategy for the identification of a new gastric lipase inhibitor from star anise for the treatment of obesity. After plant screening assays for gastric lipase inhibition, star anise was selected and investigated by bioactivity guided fractionation. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and peptide mass fingerprinting allowed the detection of an inhibitor covalently bound to the catalytic serine of gastric lipase. A mass-directed screening approach using UPLC-HRMS and accurate mass determination searching identified the flavonoid myricitrin-5-methyl ether (M5ME) as a lipase inhibitor. The inhibitory activity was rationalized based on molecular docking, showing that M5ME is susceptible to nucleophilic attack by gastric lipase. Overall, our data suggest that M5ME may be considered as a potential candidate for future application as a gastric lipase inhibitor for the treatment of obesity.",Ultra-high capacity microfluidic trapping of giant vesicles for high-throughput membrane studies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30632596,Lab on a chip,2019 04 23,"Biomimetic systems such as model lipid membranes are vital to many research fields including synthetic biology, drug discovery and membrane biophysics. One of the most commonly used are giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) due to their size similarity with biological cells and their ease of production. Typical methods for handling such delicate objects are low-throughput and do not allow solution exchange or long-term observations, all of which limits the experimental options. Herein, we present a new device designed to confine large assemblies of GUVs in microfluidic traps but is still able to perform precise and fast solution exchanges. An optimised design allows efficient filling with as many as 114 GUVs per trap and over 23 000 GUVs per device. This allows high-throughput dataset acquisitions which we demonstrate with two proof-of-concept experiments: (i) end-point measurements of vesicle interior pH and (ii) membrane transport kinetics. Moreover, we show that the design is able to selectively trap sub-populations of specific vesicle sizes and assemble them in different layers. The device can easily be applied to other high-throughput membrane studies and will pave the way for future applications using vesicle assemblies to model cellular tissues or even prototissues.",Silver(i)-catalyzed addition of pyridine-N-oxides to alkynes: a practical approach for N-alkenoxypyridinium salts.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30632594,Organic & biomolecular chemistry,2019 02 15,"A smooth catalytic approach to N-alkenoxypyridinium salts by using pyridine-N-oxides as the nucleophilic partner with alkynes under acidic conditions has been developed.

The reaction is catalysed by a unique metallo-cofactor denoted as the H-cluster containing an organometallic dinuclear Fe component, the [2Fe] subsite. The HydF protein delivers a precursor of the [2Fe] subsite to the apo-[FeFe] hydrogenase, thus completing the H-cluster and activating the enzyme. Herein we generate a semi-synthetic form of HydF by loading it with a synthetic low valent dinuclear Fe complex. We show that this semi-synthetic protein is practically indistinguishable from the native protein, and utilize this form of HydF to explore the mechanism of H-cluster assembly. More specifically, we show that transfer of the precatalyst from HydF to the hydrogenase enzyme results in the release of CO, underscoring that the pre-catalyst is a four CO species when bound to HydF. Moreover, we propose that an electron transfer reaction occurs during H-cluster assembly, resulting in an oxidation of the [2Fe] subsite with concomitant reduction of the [4Fe4S] cluster present on the HydF protein.","A one-pot metal-free protocol for the synthesis of chalcogenated furans from 1,4-enediones and thiols.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30632591,Organic & biomolecular chemistry,2019 02 15,"Transition-metal-free synthesis of chalcogenated furans through the sequential thiol-Michael/Paal-Knorr reaction of 1,4-enediones in the presence of a catalytic amount of p-toluenesulfonic acid has been developed.

To examine in detail the role of different molecular interactions in this pocket, we have synthesized a series of nine 3-(4-(2,3,5,6-tetrafluorophenyl)-1,2,3-triazol-1-yl)-thiogalactosides with different para substituents and measured their affinities to galectin-3 using a fluorescence polarization assay. High-resolution crystal structures (<1.3 Å) have been determined for five of the ligands in complex with the C-terminal domain of galectin-3. The binding affinities are rationalised with the help of the three-dimensional structures and quantum-mechanical calculations. Three effects seem to be involved: Firstly, the binding pocket is too small for the largest ligands with ethyl and methyl. Secondly, for the other ligands, the affinity seems to be determined mainly by desolvation effects, disfavouring the polar substituents, but this is partly counteracted by the cation-π interaction with Arg144, which stacks on top of the substituted tetrafluorophenyl group in all complexes. The results provide detailed insight into interactions of fluorinated phenyl moieties with arginine-containing protein binding sites and the complex interplay of different energetic components in defining the binding affinity.",Thermoelectric properties of oligoglycine molecular wires.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30632577,Nanoscale,2019 04 12,"We have investigated the electrical and thermoelectrical properties of glycine chains with and without cysteine terminal groups. The electrical conductance of (Gly)n, (Gly)nCys and Cys(Gly)nCys molecules (where Gly, Cys represent glycine and cysteine and n = 1-3) was found to decay exponentially with length l as e-βl. Our results show that connecting the molecules to gold electrodes via the sulphur atom of the cysteine moiety leads to higher β factors of 1.57 Å-1 and 1.22 Å-1 for (Gly)nCys and Cys(Gly)nCys respectively, while β = 0.92 Å-1 for (Gly)n. We also find that replacing the peptide bond with a methylene group (-CH2-) increases the conductance of (Gly)3Cys. Furthermore, we find the (Gly)1Cys and Cys(Gly)1Cys systems show good thermoelectrical performance, because of their high Seebeck coefficients (∼0.2 mV K-1) induced by the sulphur of the cysteine(s). With the contributions of both electrons and phonons taken into consideration, a high figure of merit ZT = 0.8 is obtained for (Gly)1Cys at room temperature, which increases further with increasing temperature, suggesting that peptide-based SAM junctions are promising candidates for thermoelectric energy harvesting.","Palladium(ii) pincer complexes of a C,C,C-NHC, diphosphonium bis(ylide) ligand.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30632576,"Dalton transactions (Cambridge, England : 2003)",2019 02 15,"A new family of pincer palladium(ii) complexes bearing an electron-rich C,C,C-NHC, diphosphonium bis(ylide) ligand of LX2-type was prepared through the dual N-functionalization of 1H-imidazole by (3-bromopropyl)triphenylphosphonium bromide.

During culture under dynamic flow, the formation of intestinal villi was accompanied by characteristic changes in impedance spectra both measured experimentally and verified with simulation, and we demonstrate that changes in cell layer capacitance may serve as measures of villi differentiation. This method for combining impedance spectroscopy with simulation can be adapted to better monitor cell layer characteristics within any organ-on-chip in vitro and to enable direct quantitative TEER comparisons between organ-on-chip platforms which should help to advance research on organ function.",Thermodiffusion of citrate-coated γ-Fe2O3 nanoparticles in aqueous dispersions with tuned counter-ions - anisotropy of the Soret coefficient under a magnetic field.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30632574,Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP,2019 01 23,"Under a temperature gradient, the direction of thermodiffusion of charged γ-Fe2O3 nanoparticles (NPs) depends on the nature of the counter-ions present in the dispersion, resulting in either a positive or negative Soret coefficient. Various counter-ions are probed in finely tuned and well characterized dispersions of citrate-coated NPs at comparable concentrations of free ionic species. The Soret coefficient ST is measured in stationary conditions together with the mass-diffusion coefficient Dm using a forced Rayleigh scattering method. The strong interparticle repulsion, determined by SAXS, is also attested by the increase of Dm with NP volume fraction Φ. The Φ-dependence of ST is analyzed in terms of thermophoretic and thermoelectric contributions of the various ionic species. The obtained single-particle thermophoretic contribution of the NPs (the Eastman entropy of transfer ŝNP) varies linearly with the entropy of transfer of the counter-ions. This is understood in terms of electrostatic contribution and of hydration of the ionic shell surrounding the NPs. Two aqueous dispersions, respectively, with ST > 0 and with ST < 0 are then probed under an applied field H[combining right harpoon above], and an anisotropy of Dm and of ST is induced while the in-field system remains monophasic.

At present, the treatment options available for the management of osteoporosis are limited. The present investigation evaluated the protective effect of fangchinoline against osteoporosis and also postulates the possible mechanism of action. MATERIAL AND METHODS Osteoporosis was induced by subcutaneously injecting prednisolone (2.5 mg/pellet) for 4 weeks. Fangchinoline 1, 3 and 10 mg/kg was given intraperitoneally for the period. Protective effects of fangchinoline were assessed by estimating microarchitectural parameters and bone mineral density (BMD) in the vertebrae tissues, and biochemical parameters were also determined in the serum of rats with prednisolone-induced osteoporosis. Moreover, gene expression of microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3 (LC3), B cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), caspase-3, bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2), Beclin-1, autophagy-related 5 (ATG-5), Runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX-2), and receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-b ligand (RANKL) protein in the vertebrae tissue were assessed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blot assay. RESULTS There was a significant (p<0.01) decrease in the BMD and microarchitectural parameters in the vertebrae tissue of the fangchinoline-treated group compared to the prednisolone group. We also found that treatment with fangchinoline attenuated the altered expressions of LC3, Bcl-2, caspase-3, BMP2, Beclin-1, ATG-5, RUNX-2, and RANKL protein in the prednisolone-induced osteoporosis rats. Moreover, levels of biochemical parameters were attenuated in the serum of fangchinoline-treated and prednisolone-induced osteoporosis rat. Histopathology revealed that the apoptosis of osteoblasts was decreased in the fangchinoline-treated group compared to the prednisolone group of rats. CONCLUSIONS Fangchinoline inhibits apoptosis of osteoblasts and protects against bone loss in prednisolone-induced osteoporosis rats by inducing autophagy.","Corrigendum: Analgesic effect of AG490, a Janus kinase inhibitor, on oxaliplatin-induced acute neuropathic pain.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30632519,Neural regeneration research,2019 04 01,[This corrects the article DOI: 10.4103/1673-5374.235305].,Voluntary running delays primary degeneration in rat retinas after partial optic nerve transection.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30632515,Neural regeneration research,2019 04 01,"Running is believed to be beneficial for human health. Many studies have focused on the neuroprotective effects of voluntary running on animal models. There were both primary and secondary degeneration in neurodegenerative diseases, including glaucoma. However, whether running can delay primary or secondary degeneration or both of them was not clear. Partial optic nerve transection model is a valuable glaucoma model for studying both primary and secondary degeneration because it can separate primary (mainly in the superior retina) from secondary (mainly in the inferior retina) degeneration. Therefore, we compared the survival of retinal ganglion cells between Sprague-Dawley rat runners and non-runners both in the superior and inferior retinas. Excitotoxicity, oxidative stress, and apoptosis are involved in the degeneration of retinal ganglion cells in glaucoma. So we also used western immunoblotting to compare the expression of some proteins involved in apoptosis (phospho-c-Jun N-terminal kinases, p-JNKs), oxidative stress (manganese superoxide dismutase, MnSOD) and excitotoxicity (glutamine synthetase) between runners and non-runners after partial optic nerve transection. Results showed that voluntary running delayed the death of retinal ganglion cells vulnerable to primary degeneration but not those to secondary degeneration. In addition, voluntary running decreased the expression of glutamine synthetase, but not the expression of p-JNKs and MnSOD in the superior retina after partial optic nerve transection. These results illustrated that primary degeneration of retinal ganglion cells might be mainly related with excitotoxicity rather than oxidative stress; and the voluntary running could down-regulate excitotoxicity to delay the primary degeneration of retinal ganglion cells after partial optic nerve transection.",Repair of peripheral nerve defects by nerve transposition using small gap bio-sleeve suture with different inner diameters at both ends.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30632512,Neural regeneration research,2019 04 01,"During peripheral nerve transposition repair, if the diameter difference between transposed nerves is large or multiple distal nerves must be repaired at the same time, traditional epineurial neurorrhaphy has the problem of high tension at the suture site, which may even lead to the failure of nerve suture. We investigated whether a small gap bio-sleeve suture with different inner diameters at both ends can be used to repair a 2-mm tibial nerve defect by proximal transposition of the common peroneal nerve in rats and compared the results with the repair seen after epineurial neurorrhaphy. Three months after surgery, neurological function, nerve regeneration, and recovery of nerve innervation muscle were assessed using the tibial nerve function index, neuroelectrophysiological testing, muscle biomechanics and wet weight measurement, osmic acid staining, and hematoxylin-eosin staining. There was no obvious inflammatory reaction and neuroma formation in the tibial nerve after repair by the small gap bio-sleeve suture with different inner diameters at both ends. The conduction velocity, muscle strength, wet muscle weight, cross-sectional area of muscle fibers, and the number of new myelinated nerve fibers in the bio-sleeve suture group were similar to those in the epineurial neurorrhaphy group. Our findings indicate that small gap bio-sleeve suture with different inner diameters at both ends can achieve surgical suture between nerves of different diameters and promote regeneration and functional recovery of injured peripheral nerves.",Repair of long segmental ulnar nerve defects in rats by several different kinds of nerve transposition.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30632510,Neural regeneration research,2019 04 01,"Multiple regeneration of axonal buds has been shown to exist during the repair of peripheral nerve injury, which confirms a certain repair potential of the injured peripheral nerve. Therefore, a systematic nerve transposition repair technique has been proposed to treat severe peripheral nerve injury. During nerve transposition repair, the regenerated nerve fibers of motor neurons in the anterior horn of the spinal cord can effectively grow into the repaired distal nerve and target muscle tissues, which is conducive to the recovery of motor function. The aim of this study was to explore regeneration and nerve functional recovery after repairing a long-segment peripheral nerve defect by transposition of different donor nerves. A long-segment (2 mm) ulnar nerve defect in Sprague-Dawley rats was repaired by transposition of the musculocutaneous nerve, medial pectoral nerve, muscular branches of the radial nerve and anterior interosseous nerve (pronator quadratus muscle branch). In situ repair of the ulnar nerve was considered as a control. Three months later, wrist flexion function, nerve regeneration and innervation muscle recovery in rats were assessed using neuroelectrophysiological testing, osmic acid staining and hematoxylin-eosin staining, respectively. Our findings indicate that repair of a long-segment ulnar nerve defect with different donor nerve transpositions can reinnervate axonal function of motor neurons in the anterior horn of spinal cord and restore the function of affected limbs to a certain extent.",Qian-Zheng-San promotes regeneration after sciatic nerve crush injury in rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30632509,Neural regeneration research,2019 04 01,"Qian-Zheng-San, a traditional Chinese prescription consisting of Typhonii Rhizoma, Bombyx Batryticatus, Scorpio, has been found to play an active therapeutic role in central nervous system diseases. However, it is unclear whether Qian-Zheng-San has therapeutic value for peripheral nerve injury. Therefore, we used Sprague-Dawley rats to investigate this. A sciatic nerve crush injury model was induced by clamping the right sciatic nerve. Subsequently, rats in the treatment group were administered 2 mL Qian-Zheng-San (1.75 g/mL) daily as systemic therapy for 1, 2, 4, or 8 weeks. Rats in the control group were not administered Qian-Zheng-San. Rats in sham group did not undergo surgery and systemic therapy. Footprint analysis was used to assess nerve motor function. Electrophysiological experiments were used to detect nerve conduction function. Immunofluorescence staining was used to assess axon counts and morphological analysis. Immunohistochemical staining was used to observe myelin regeneration of the sciatic nerve and the number of motoneurons in the anterior horn of the spinal cord. At 2 and 4 weeks postoperatively, the sciatic nerve function index, nerve conduction velocity, the number of distant regenerated axons and the axon diameter of the sciatic nerve increased in the Qian-Zheng-San treatment group compared with the control group. At 2 weeks postoperatively, nerve fiber diameter, myelin thickness, and the number of motor neurons in the lumbar spinal cord anterior horn increased in the Qian-Zheng-San treatment group compared with the control group. These results indicate that Qian-Zheng-San has a positive effect on peripheral nerve regeneration."

Hereditary spastic paraplegia is caused by retrograde degeneration of the long corticospinal tract axons, leading to progressive spasticity and weakness of leg and hip muscles. There are over 70 subtypes with various underlying pathophysiological processes, such as defective vesicular trafficking, lipid metabolism, organelle shaping, axonal transport, and mitochondrial dysfunction. Although hereditary spastic paraplegia consists of various subtypes with different pathological characteristics, defects in mitochondrial morphology and function emerge as one of the common cellular themes in hereditary spastic paraplegia. Mitochondrial morphology and function are remodeled by mitochondrial dynamics regulated by several key fission and fusion mediators. However, the role of mitochondrial dynamics in axonal defects of hereditary spastic paraplegia remains largely unknown. Recently, studies reported perturbed mitochondrial morphology in hereditary spastic paraplegia neurons. Moreover, downregulation of mitochondrial fission regulator dynamin-related protein 1, both pharmacologically and genetically, could rescue axonal outgrowth defects in hereditary spastic paraplegia neurons, providing a potential therapeutic target for treating these hereditary spastic paraplegia. This mini-review will describe the regulation of mitochondrial fission/fusion, the link between mitochondrial dynamics and axonal defects, and the recent progress on the role of mitochondrial dynamics in axonal defects of hereditary spastic paraplegia.",Uncoupling neurotrophic function from nociception of nerve growth factor: what can be learned from a rare human disease?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30632491,Neural regeneration research,2019 04 01,"Nerve growth factor (NGF) is a powerful trophic factor that provides essential support for the survival and differentiation of sympathetic and sensory neurons during development. However, NGF also activates nociceptors contributing significantly to inflammatory pain and neuropathic pain after tissue injury. As such anti-NGF based therapies represent a promising strategy for pain management. Because of dose-dependent serious side effects such as back pain, injection site hyperalgesia, clinical trials of using NGF to treat various disorders such as diabetic neuropathies, chemotherapy-induced and human immunodeficiency virus-associated peripheral neuropathies were all discontinued. Thus far, worldwide clinical applications of NGF in treating patients are very limited except in China. Hereditary sensory autonomic neuropathy type V (HSAN V) is an extremely rare disease. Genetic analyses have revealed that HSAN V is associated with autosomal recessive mutations in NGF. One of the mutations occurred at the 100th position of mature NGF resulting in a change of residue from arginine to tryptophan (R100W). Although those HSAN V patients associated with the NGFR100W mutation suffer from severe loss of deep pain, bone fractures and joint destruction, interestingly patients with the NGFR100W mutation do not show apparent cognitive deficits, suggesting important trophic support function is preserved. We believe that NGFR100W provides an ideal tool to uncouple the two important functions of NGF: trophic versus nociceptive. Studies from investigators including ourselves have indeed confirmed in animal testing that the NGFR100W no longer induced pain. More importantly, the trophic function seemed to be largely preserved in NGF harboring the R100W mutation. On the mechanistic level, we found that the NGFR100W mutation was capable of binding to and signaling through the tyrosine receptor kinase A receptor. But its ability to bind to and activate the 75 kDa neurotrophic factor was significantly diminished. The significance of these findings is at least two folds: 1) the NGFR100W mutation can be used as an alternative to the wildtype NGF to treat human conditions without eliciting pain; and 2) the 75 kDa neurotrophic factor may serve as a novel target for pain management. We will discuss all the details in this mini-review.",Rabs and axonal regeneration.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30632490,Neural regeneration research,2019 04 01,"Membrane trafficking processes are presumably vital for axonal regeneration after injury, but mechanistic understanding in this regard has been sparse. A recent loss-of-function screen had been carried out for factors important for axonal regeneration by cultured cortical neurons and the results suggested that the activity of a number of Rab GTPases might act to restrict axonal regeneration. A loss of Rab27b, in particular, is shown to enhance axonal regeneration in vitro, as well as in C. elegans and mouse central nervous system injury models in vivo. Possible mechanisms underlying this new finding, which has important academic and translational implication, are discussed.",Corneal re-innervation following refractive surgery treatments.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30632489,Neural regeneration research,2019 04 01,"Laser refractive surgery is one of the most performed surgical procedures in the world. Although regarded safe and efficient, it has side effects. All of the laser based refractive surgical procedures invoke corneal nerve injury to some degree. The impact of this denervation can range from mild discomfort to neurotrophic corneas. Currently, three techniques are widely used for laser vision correction: small incision lenticule extraction, laser-assisted keratomileusis in situ and photorefractive keratotomy. Each of these techniques affects corneal innervation differently and has a different pattern of nerve regeneration. The purpose of this review is to summarize the different underlying mechanisms for corneal nerve injury and compare the different patterns of corneal reinnervation.",Critical evaluation of two models of flow cytometers for the assessment of sperm DNA fragmentation: an appeal for performance verification.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30632487,Asian journal of andrology,2019 01 15,"Lack of standardized, reproducible protocols and reference values is among the challenges faced when using new or upgraded versions of instruments in reproductive laboratories and flow cytometry. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay combined with flow cytometry routinely used for diagnostic measurement of sperm DNA fragmentation (SDF) is a unique example. Any change in the setting of the standard instrument, including upgrades of hardware or software, can lead to different results and may affect clinicians' decision for treatment. Therefore, we compared TUNEL results of SDF obtained from a standard (C6) flow cytometer with a newer version of the same instrument (C6 Plus) and examined the cutoff, sensitivity, and specificity without calibration (adjustment) and after adjustment. Identical sperm preparation and matched acquisition settings were used to examine the performance of two flow cytometers. The strength of agreement of the results between the two observers was also assessed. After adjustment of the settings, overall concordance became high and the two cytometers showed 100% positive and negative predictive value with 100% area under the curve. The overall correlation coefficient observed between C6 and C6 Plus was highly significant (P < 0.0001; r = 0.992; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.982-0.997). After adjustment, the two cytometers showed very high precision of 98% and accuracy of >99%. The interobserver agreement on C6 flow cytometer for the two observers was 0.801 ± 0.062 and 0.746 ± 0.044 for C6 Plus.

Only capacitated sperm can undergo acrosomal exocytosis, near or on the egg, a process that allows the sperm to penetrate and fertilize the egg. In the present study, we investigated the involvement of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent processes on acrosomal exocytosis. Inhibition of protein kinase A (PKA) at the end of capacitation induced acrosomal exocytosis. This process is cAMP-dependent; however, the addition of relatively high concentration of the membrane-permeable 8-bromo-cAMP (8Br-cAMP, 0.1 mmol l-1) analog induced significant inhibition of the acrosomal exocytosis. The induction of acrosomal exocytosis by PKA inhibition was significantly inhibited by an exchange protein directly activated by cAMP (EPAC) ESI09 inhibitor. The EPAC selective substrate activated AE at relatively low concentrations (0.02-0.1 μmol l-1), whereas higher concentrations (>5 μmol l-1) were inhibitory to the AE induced by PKA inhibition. Inhibition of PKA revealed about 50% increase in intracellular cAMP levels, conditions under which EPAC can be activated to induce the AE. Induction of AE by activating the actin severing-protein, gelsolin, which causes F-actin dispersion, was inhibited by the EPAC inhibitor. The AE induced by PKA inhibition was mediated by phospholipase C activity but not by the Ca2+-channel, CatSper. Thus, inhibition of PKA at the end of the capacitation process induced EPAC/phospholipase C-dependent acrosomal exocytosis. EPAC mediates F-actin depolymerization and/or activation of effectors downstream to F-actin breakdown that lead to acrosomal exocytosis.",Clinical and socioeconomic factors associated with delayed orchidopexy in cryptorchid boys in China: a retrospective study of 2423 cases.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30632485,Asian journal of andrology,2019 05 09,"We investigated the associations of clinical and socioeconomic factors with delayed orchidopexy for cryptorchidism in China. A retrospective study was conducted on cryptorchid boys who underwent orchidopexy at Children's Hospital at Chongqing Medical University in China from January 2012 to December 2017. Of 2423 patients, 410 (16.9%) received timely repair by 18 months of age, beyond which surgery was considered delayed. Univariate analysis suggested that the laterality of cryptorchidism (P = 0.001), comorbidities including inguinal hernia/scrotal hydrocele (P < 0.001) or urinary tract disease (P = 0.016), and whether patients lived in a poverty county (P < 0.001) could influence whether orchidopexy was timely or delayed. Logistic regression analysis suggested that the following factors were associated with delayed repair: unilateral rather than bilateral cryptorchidism (odds ratio [OR] = 1.752, P < 0.001), absence of inguinal hernia or hydrocele (OR = 2.027, P = 0.019), absence of urinary tract disease (OR = 3.712, P < 0.001), and living in a poverty county (OR = 2.005, P < 0.001).

There are two approaches in EUS-PD: EUS-guided rendezvous (EUS-RV) and EUS-guided transmural drainage (EUS-TMD). In cases with normal anatomy, EUS-RV should be the first approach, whereas EUS-TMD can be selected in cases with SAA or duodenal obstruction. In our literature review, technical success and adverse event rates were 78.7% and 21.8%, respectively. The technical success rate of EUS-RV appeared lower than EUS-TMD due to the difficulty in guidewire passage.

Five fungal pathogens, Stagonosporopsis spp., Podosphaera xanthii, Cercospora citrullina, Colletotrichum orbiculare, and Myrothecium sensu lato (s.l.), and the oomycete Pseudoperonospora cubensis were included in the analyses. Among the factors we analyzed, there was a consistent increased probability of occurrence of Stagonosporopsis spp. in fields with a previous cucurbit crop, increasing probabilities of pathogen occurrence with increasing plant age, a lower probability of occurrence of some pathogens on triploid cultivars compared with diploid cultivars, and a decrease in probability of pathogen occurrence in fields aligned toward southwest or west. Application of fungicides significantly reduced the probability of observing C. citrullina, P. cubensis, and Stagonosporopsis spp. in 2015 and P. xanthii in spring 2016. This study emphasizes the importance of crop rotation and fungicide applications to manage foliar diseases of watermelon, particularly gummy stem blight, powdery mildew, and downy mildew. Crop age, cultivar type, and field alignment also were found to significantly influence the probability of pathogen occurrence. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study examining the influence of various factors on foliar pathogens of watermelon with data collected from commercial fields.",Pruning Wound Protection Strategies for Simultaneous Control of Eutypa and Botryosphaeria Dieback in New Zealand.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30632468,Plant disease,2019 03 22,"The grapevine trunk diseases Eutypa and Botryosphaeria dieback threaten the sustainability of vineyards worldwide. This study aimed to develop practical and efficient wound protection strategies, which will lead to widespread adoption of preventative control for these diseases and increased longevity of vineyards. Five fungicides (tebuconazole, carbendazim, fluazinam, mancozeb, and flusilazole) were evaluated for efficacy against Eutypa lata and Neofusicoccum luteum infection on pruning wounds of 'Sauvignon blanc' in a New Zealand vineyard. All five fungicides controlled infection by both pathogens to varying degrees, with mean percent disease control of 70 to 90% for E. lata and 33 to 93% for N. luteum. This has led to the first known registration of a fungicide, fluazinam (Gem), for simultaneous control of both Eutypa and Botryosphaeria dieback. Furthermore, application of carbendazim with tractor-driven sprayers provided similar control of E. lata and N. luteum to that when applied by hand with a paintbrush. This constitutes the first report of Botryosphaeria dieback control with fungicides applied with tractor-driven sprayers.",Factors Influencing How Intensive Care Unit Nurses Allocate Their Time.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30632467,Western journal of nursing research,2019 01 11,"Spending time with the patient is essential for intensive care unit (ICU) nurses to detect clinical change. This article reports on an examination of factors influencing nurses' activity time allocation. Data were analyzed from a prospective time and motion study of medical ICU nurses. Nurse demographic data and observation, electronic locator technology, and electronic medical record log data were collected over 12 days from 11 registered nurses. Charlson Co-Morbidity Index and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores were calculated for patient assignments. Nurses averaged 78.04 ( SD = 47.85) min per patient on activities in the patient room. Years of ICU nursing experience and the patient's Charlson Co-Morbidity Index was significantly associated with time spent in the patient's room. Neither nursing education nor specialty certification was found to influence time spent in a patient's room. Using technology can advance understanding of nurses' time allocation leading to interventions optimizing time spent with the patient.",Three-Dimensional Culture of Salivary Gland Stem Cell in Orthotropic Decellularized Extracellular Matrix Hydrogels.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30632466,Tissue engineering.

Although numerous tissue engineering (TE) approaches have shown success in cartilage and bone tissue regeneration, achieving native-like characteristics of these tissues remains challenging. This study demonstrates that in the presence of a corresponding differentiation medium, gelatin-based hydrogels support moderate osteogenic and excellent chondrogenic differentiation of photo-encapsulated human adipose-derived stem cell microspheroids, the extent of which depends on hydrogel stiffness. Because photosensitive hydrogels are a convenient material platform for creating stiffness gradients in three dimensions, the presented microspheroid-hydrogel encapsulation strategy holds promise for future strategies of cartilage or bone TE.",Minimally Invasive Video-Assisted Thyroidectomy: Analysis of Complications From a Systematic Review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30632464,Surgical innovation,2019 05 15,"Nowadays, minimally invasive video-assisted thyroidectomy (MIVAT) is considered a safe and effective option.

However, membrane fouling remains as a limiting factor for its greater diffusion. This work performed a sensitivity analysis study to investigate the effects of analytical and operating variables on membrane permeability. The case study is a MBR treating oil refinery effluents. After the identification and validation of a predictive neural model for permeability, sensitivity analysis methods based on both connection weights and variable disturbances were used to quantify and rank the variables influence. A comprehensive analysis showed that Suspended solids and Days between cleanings exerted greater effects on permeability, whereas sludge filterability and sludge temperature were less significant. In sequence, a specific analysis revealed distinct dynamics in MBR operation given different solids concentrations. For instance, from higher solids concentrations, among all the evaluated parameters, only COD presented low significance to the permeability. This evidence suggests that permeability is more susceptible to variations when operating with higher concentrations of Suspended solids. The global result of this study contributes to more efficient MBR operations since distinct relations with permeability imply different effects on membrane fouling.",The Role and Mechanism of miRNA-1224 in the Polygonatum sibiricum Polysaccharide Regulation of Bone Marrow-Derived Macrophages to Osteoclast Differentiation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30632458,Rejuvenation research,2019 03 15,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous noncoding small molecule RNAs that regulate cell proliferation, differentiation, fat metabolism, and hormone secretion. Studies have shown that miRNAs regulate the processes related to osteoporosis, including the differentiation of osteoblasts, osteoclasts, and chondrocytes, and are one of the important regulatory factors of some bone metabolic diseases. In our previous study, it has been revealed that natural compound Polygonatum sibiricum polysaccharide (PSP) can promote osteoblast formation and block osteoclastogenesis through Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. This study was designed to investigate whether PSP can inhibit expression of osteoclast-related genes by Hippo signaling pathway, which was prevented by effectively blocking the expression of miR-1224. This study showed that there were 27 differentially expressed miRNAs when PSP inhibits osteoclastogenesis, the most notable of which was miR-1224. Furthermore, the study showed that PSP increased the level of Limd1, which was the target gene of miR-1224. In conclusion, these findings demonstrate that PSP suppressed osteoclastogenesis in vitro through the Hippo signaling pathway based on miR-1224. This study may aid in the development of a therapeutic approach utilizing PSP for the enhancement of bone health and prevention of osteoporosis."

Results from body composition scans are useful for athletic populations to track training and nutritional interventions, while bone mineral density scans are valuable for athletes at risk of developing stress fractures due to low bone mineral density. However, no research has ascertained if a novice technician (accredited but not experienced) could produce similar results to an experienced technician. Two groups of recreational athletes were scanned, one by an experienced technician, one by a novice technician. All participants were scanned twice with repositioning between scans. The experienced technician's reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient = .989-.998; percentage change in mean = -0.01 to 0.10), precision (typical error as coefficient of variation percentage = 0.01-0.47; SEM% = 0.61-1.39), and sensitivity to change (smallest real difference percentage = 1.70-3.85) were similar; however, superior to those of the novice technician. The novice technician results were reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient = .985-.997; percentage change in mean = -0.03 to 0.23), precision (typical error as coefficient of variation percentage = 0.03-0.75; SEM% = 1.06-2.12), and sensitivity to change (smallest real difference percentage = 2.73-5.86).

Within athletics (track and field), the science and art of periodization is a cornerstone concept with recent commentaries emphasizing the underappreciated complexity associated with predictable performance on demand. Nevertheless, with varying levels of evidence, sport and event specific sequencing of various training units and sessions (long [macrocycle; months], medium [mesocycle; weeks], and short [microcycle; days and within-day duration]) is a routine approach to training periodization. Indeed, implementation of strategic temporal nutrition interventions (macro, meso, and micro) can support and enhance training prescription and adaptation, as well as acute event specific performance. However, a general framework on how, why, and when nutritional periodization could be implemented has not yet been established. It is beyond the scope of this review to highlight every potential nutritional periodization application. Instead, this review will focus on a generalized framework, with specific examples of macro-, meso-, and microperiodization for the macronutrients of carbohydrates, and, by extension, fat. More specifically, the authors establish the evidence and rationale for situations of acute high carbohydrate availability, as well as the evidence for more chronic manipulation of carbohydrates coupled with training. The topic of periodized nutrition has made considerable gains over the last decade but is ripe for further scientific progress and field application.",Fecal microbiota transplantation in refractory ulcerative colitis - a case report.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30632438,The Journal of international medical research,2019 06 13,"Studies comparing gut microbiota profiles of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients have shown several changes in microbiota composition, with marked reduction of local biodiversity relative to that of healthy controls. Modulation of the bacterial community is a promising strategy to reduce the proportion of harmful microorganisms and increase the proportion of beneficial bacteria; this is expected to prevent or treat IBD. The exact mechanism of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) remains unknown; however, replacing the host microbiota can reestablish gut microbial composition and function in IBD patients. The present report describes an ulcerative colitis patient who underwent FMT. A 17-year-old male with moderate to severe clinical activity, which was refractory to mesalazine, azathioprine, and infliximab, underwent FMT as alternative therapy. The patient exhibited clinical improvement after the procedure; however, the symptoms returned. A second FMT was performed 8 months after the first procedure, but the patient did not improve. In conclusion, despite the FMT failure observed in this patient, the procedure is a promising therapeutic option for IBD patients, and more in-depth studies of this method are needed.","Dietary Practices Adopted by Track-and-Field Athletes: Gluten-Free, Low FODMAP, Vegetarian, and Fasting.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30632437,International journal of sport nutrition and exercise metabolism,2019 05 31,"Some track-and-field athletes implement special diets aiming to improve health and/or performance. An evidence-based approach to any diet is recommended to minimize the risks associated with unnecessary dietary restriction, which may potentially do more harm than good. Four prevalent diets are reviewed in this study: (a) gluten-free; (b) low fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAP); (c) vegetarian; and (d) fasting diets. Recently, gluten-free diets and low FODMAP diets have emerged as novel regimes thought to improve gastrointestinal health and reduce the risk of exercise-associated gastrointestinal symptoms. No direct beneficial outcomes have been associated with avoiding gluten for clinically healthy athletes. Indirectly, a gluten-free diet is associated with other dietary changes, particularly FODMAP reduction, which may improve adverse gastrointestinal symptoms. Vegetarian diets can optimally support athletic demands. However, attention is required to ensure adequate energy and intake of specific nutrients that are less abundant or less well absorbed from plant sources. Finally, fasting is a long-standing concept that is undertaken on a voluntary and obligatory basis. Despite limited supporting research, voluntary fasting is a popular alternative to conventional diets perceptually offering health and body composition benefits. Strict obligatory fasting guidelines likely require the implementation of tailored nutrition strategies to help athletes cope with athletic demands. Overall, a multitude of factors influence adherence to special diets. Even when adherence to a special diet is a necessity, education and advice from an accredited dietitian/nutritionist are recommended for track-and-field athletes to optimize nutrition for health and performance.",Risk factors associated with peripherally inserted central catheter-related venous thrombosis in hospitalized patients of advanced age.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30632436,The Journal of international medical research,2019 03 05,This study was performed to determine the risk factors associated with peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC)-related venous thrombosis in patients of advanced age (>65 years).,Differential regulation of GSK-3β in spinal dorsal horn and in hippocampus mediated by interleukin-1beta contributes to pain hypersensitivity and memory deficits following peripheral nerve injury.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30632435,Molecular pain,2019 05 17,"Accumulating evidence shows that inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3β) ameliorates cognitive impairments caused by a diverse array of diseases. Our previous work showed that spared nerve injury (SNI) that induces neuropathic pain causes short-term memory deficits. Here, we reported that GSK-3β activity was enhanced in hippocampus and reduced in spinal dorsal horn following SNI, and the changes persisted for at least 45 days. Repetitive applications of selective GSK-3β inhibitors (SB216763, 5 mg/kg, intraperitoneally, three times or AR-A014418, 400 ng/kg, intrathecally, seven times) prevented short-term memory deficits but did not affect neuropathic pain induced by SNI. Surprisingly, we found that the repetitive SB216763 or AR-A014418 induced a persistent pain hypersensitivity in sham animals. Mechanistically, both β-catenin and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) were upregulated in spinal dorsal horn but downregulated in hippocampus following SNI. Injections of SB216763 prevented the BDNF downregulation in hippocampus but enhanced its upregulation in spinal dorsal horn in SNI rats. In sham rats, SB216763 upregulated both β-catenin and BDNF in spinal dorsal horn but affect neither of them in hippocampus. Finally, intravenous injection of interleukin-1beta that induces pain hypersensitivity and memory deficits mimicked the SNI-induced the differential regulation of GSK-3β/β-catenin/BDNF in spinal dorsal horn and in hippocampus. Accordingly, the prolonged opposite changes of GSK-3β activity in hippocampus and in spinal dorsal horn induced by SNI may contribute to memory deficits and neuropathic pain by differential regulation of BDNF in the two regions. GSK-3β inhibitors that treat cognitive disorders may result in a long-lasting pain hypersensitivity.",C57BL/6 substrain differences in inflammatory and neuropathic nociception and genetic mapping of a major quantitative trait locus underlying acute thermal nociception.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30632432,Molecular pain,2019 05 17,"Sensitivity to different pain modalities has a genetic basis that remains largely unknown. Employing closely related inbred mouse substrains can facilitate gene mapping of nociceptive behaviors in preclinical pain models. We previously reported enhanced sensitivity to acute thermal nociception in C57BL/6J (B6J) versus C57BL/6N (B6N) substrains. Here, we expanded on nociceptive phenotypes and observed an increase in formalin-induced inflammatory nociceptive behaviors and paw diameter in B6J versus B6N mice (Charles River Laboratories). No strain differences were observed in mechanical or thermal hypersensitivity or in edema following the Complete Freund's Adjuvant model of inflammatory pain, indicating specificity in the inflammatory nociceptive stimulus. In the chronic constrictive nerve injury, a model of neuropathic pain, no strain differences were observed in baseline mechanical threshold or in mechanical hypersensitivity up to one month post-chronic constrictive nerve injury. We replicated the enhanced thermal nociception in the 52.5°C hot plate test in B6J versus B6N mice from The Jackson Laboratory. Using a B6J × B6N-F2 cross (N = 164), we mapped a major quantitative trait locus underlying hot plate sensitivity to chromosome 7 that peaked at 26 Mb (log of the odds [LOD] = 3.81, p < 0.01; 8.74 Mb-36.50 Mb) that was more pronounced in males. Genes containing expression quantitative trait loci associated with the peak nociceptive marker that are implicated in pain and inflammation include Ryr1, Cyp2a5, Pou2f2, Clip3, Sirt2, Actn4, and Ltbp4 (false discovery rate < 0.05).

Areas covered: The main pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics of the monoclonal antibodies against IL-5, IL-5Ra, IL4-IL13, and IgE, that are currently marketed or understood for severe asthma are discussed in this paper. Expert opinion: The currently available biological drugs represent an excellent therapeutic add-on to traditional drugs, especially in replacing systemic corticosteroid therapies.

Herein, we demonstrate that an original tanshinone IIA derivative (Tan-TPP) could probably be improved myocardial I/R injury suppressant. It was optimised by mitochondria targeting group triphenylphosphine (TPP). Intriguingly, it could accumulate in mitochondria to more efficiently inhibit the activity of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), which is closely related with I/R oxidative injury. Moreover, by inhibiting SDH activity, it could better prevent excess intracellular reactive oxygen species production to reduce oxidative damage, and regulate ATP levels to ensure energy output.

In multivariate analysis, KPro status remained positively associated with TNF-α levels (β = 0.36; 95% confidence intervals [CI]: 0.14-0.58; p = 0.002) and TNFR2 levels (β = 458.3; 95% CI: 32.8-883.7; p = 0.035) after adjusting for age, gender, BMI, glaucoma status, and ESR. TNFR1 and leptin levels were not significantly different in the study groups. Conclusions: We detected elevated serum levels of TNF-α and TNFR2 in KPro patients. Longitudinal studies are needed to establish TNF-α and TNFR2 as serum biomarkers related to KPro surgery.

As allo-HCT expands to older and potentially less fit individuals, prognosticating transplant outcomes in this population remains an ongoing need. Areas covered: This review summarizes pre-transplant assessment tools in optimizing patient selection and predicting transplant outcomes in older adults, including comorbidity indices, psychosocial assessment, geriatric assessment, serum biomarkers, and disease risk. This review also discusses the impact of donor age and clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate significance on transplant outcomes. Expert commentary: Determining which patients should be referred for transplant remains challenging, especially in older adults. Chronological age is an insufficient prognostic metric, and refining, validating, and developing novel pre-transplant risk assessment tools for geriatric patients offers great potential benefit to the field.",Combined Atropine with Orthokeratology for Myopia Control: Study Design and Preliminary Results.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30632410,Current eye research,2019 06 03,"Purpose: The purpose of this study is to present the study design and one month's preliminary results of a 2-year randomized trial, Combined Atropine with Orthokeratology (AOK), for myopia control study. Methods: Children aged 6 to <11 years and with 1.00-4.00 D myopia were randomly assigned to AOK group or ortho-k alone (OK) group. Subjects are required to attend routine ortho-k aftercare visits (first-overnight, 1 week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks, 1 month, and every 3 months after commencement of lens wear). Clinical outcomes, including lens performance, changes in refractive error, unaided vision, ocular adverse events, corneal staining, lens binding and centration, and axial length, are also assessed at 6-monthly data collection visit. Results: Data of 30 AOK and 34 OK subjects who had completed the 1-month visit were analyzed. No significant differences in baseline data were found between the two groups (P > 0.05). At the 1-month visit, first-fit success rate was 95%, with full myopia reduction. Mild corneal staining was observed in 23.3% and 30.9% and mild self-reported lens binding in 50% and 41% in AOK and OK groups, respectively, after 1-month lens wear. Mean (±standard deviation) change in axial length was significantly higher in AOK than OK subjects (AOK: -0.05 ± 0.05 mm; OK: -0.02 ± 0.03 mm) (P = 0.003). Conclusions: After 1 month of treatment, first-fit success rate of ortho-k lenses was high in both groups of subjects; addition of 0.01% atropine in AOK subjects did not affect the lens performance or clinical responses. These results provide the assurance that it is acceptable to continue this longitudinal study, as longer study duration, usually 2 years, is required to determine the effectiveness of treatment for myopia control.",Noninvasive Gene Electrotransfer in Skin.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30632408,Human gene therapy methods,2019 02 15,The skin is considered as well suited for gene therapy and vaccination.

Therefore, an investigation of eyes-open resting-state dynamic functional network connectivity (dFNC) of healthy controls (HC) versus that of schizophrenia patients (SP) via both functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and a novel magnetoencephalography (MEG) pipeline was completed. The fMRI analysis used a spatial independent component analysis (ICA) to determine the networks on which the dFNC was based. The MEG analysis utilized a source space activity estimate (minimum norm estimate [MNE]/dynamic statistical parametric mapping [dSPM]) whose result was the input to a spatial ICA, on which the networks of the MEG dFNC were based. We found that dFNC measures reveal significant differences between HC and SP, which depended on the imaging modality. Consistent with previous findings, a dFNC analysis predicated on fMRI data revealed HC and SP remain in different overall brain states (defined by a k-means clustering of network correlations) for significantly different periods of time, with SP spending less time in a highly connected state. The MEG dFNC, in contrast, revealed group differences in more global statistics: SP changed between meta-states (k-means cluster states that are allowed to overlap in time) significantly more often and to states that were more different, relative to HC. MEG dFNC also revealed a highly connected state where a significant difference was observed in interindividual variability, with greater variability among SP. Overall, our results show that fMRI and MEG reveal between-group functional connectivity differences in distinct ways, highlighting the utility of using each of the modalities individually, or potentially a combination of modalities, to better inform our understanding of disorders such as schizophrenia.",Release of mitochondrial DNA is associated with mortality in severe acute heart failure.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30632383,European heart journal.

During the treatment evaluation phase, we compared RIRD and RI to determine whether either procedure was successful in decreasing the duration of PM. In the RIRD condition, contingent on the occurrence of any PM the participant completed physical activities involving both hands (e.g., moving chairs, touching toes). In the RI condition, the therapist interrupted all instances of PM using physical and verbal prompts (e.g., saying in a neutral tone, ""Stop that"" and moving hands away from genitals).

Specifically, we show that diisopropylammonium bromide (DIPAB) based 2D ferroelectric monolayer molecular crystal with large in-plane Ps of ∼1.5 × 10-6 μC cm-1 can be achieved by slicing the bulk DIPAB along a specific plane while keeping the space group unchanged. The important roles of hydrogen bonds are also identified. Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations indicate that, with the support of a graphene substrate, the ferroelectric order of 2D DIPAB monolayer can be retained at room temperature.

They contribute to the organoleptic characteristics of wine such as color, astringency, and bitterness. Although tannins found in wine can come from microbial and oak sources, the main sources of polyphenols are grape skins and seeds. Since the 1960s, this subject has been widely studied by a large number of researchers covering different types of wine, climate conditions, growing practices, and grape varieties. As these works have been conducted under different conditions, the data collected can be conflicting. Moreover, even though the biosynthesis of the major proanthocyanidins units (+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin is well-known, the mechanism of their polymerization remains unexplained. This is why the question remains: what factors influence the biosynthesis, the quantity, and the distribution of tannins in grape seeds and how can winemaking processes impact the extractability of seed tannins in wine?",Mechanism of the Manganese-Pincer-Catalyzed Acceptorless Dehydrogenative Coupling of Nitriles and Alcohols.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30632367,Journal of the American Chemical Society,2019 02 13,"A recent study showed that a Mn-pincer could catalyze the acceptorless dehydrogenative coupling of nitriles and alcohols to yield acrylonitriles. The reaction mechanism proposed in that work contained some intermediates that, in most of the cases, were not characterized. Moreover, one of the intermediates involved a charged separation, which is unlikely in apolar solvents. To clarify the reaction mechanism of this critical reaction, we decided to perform a DFT study. Our results prove the existence of a cooperative effect of the metal and the ligand in several steps of the catalytic cycle. We also find the presence of several equilibria between isomeric intermediates where water, or the same alcohol reagent, takes part in assisting the proton transfer. Furthermore, we have analyzed the charge-separated structure proposed experimentally and have found a nearly pure covalent bond between the two expected charged moieties. Finally, the Knoevenagel condensation step that generates the acrylonitrile is found to be the rate-determining step.",Synthesis and Characterization of Oxygen-Embedded Quinoidal Pentacene and Nonacene.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30632366,Journal of the American Chemical Society,2019 02 06,"Extension of oxygen-embedded polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), in particular with a defined topology, is synthetically challenging primarily because of limited regio-specific methods and poor solubility of PAHs. We reported herein an efficient way to construct quinoidal pentacenes and nonacenes with regular zigzag O-inserted edges. These O-embedded backbones composed of benzene, pyranyl, and cyclohexa-1,4-diene moieties provided access to a new class of longitudinally conjugated acenes with superior stability. Their structures, confirmed by single-crystal XRD analysis, indicated that they possessed rich hydrogen/halogen-bonding interactions, which likely contribute to the strengthened aggregation. In contrast to many other O-annulated PAHs generally displaying short-absorption wavelengths due to partially interrupted electron communication, the O-embedded quinoidal acene exhibited highly red-shifted absorptions (up to ∼699 nm) and narrowed energy gaps (down to ∼1.5 eV). As with more O-containing rings and quinoidal subunits in the backbone, the conjugation size was enlarged, and the molar absorption coefficients (ε) of the λmax significantly increased further, in particular, a noticeable lower-energy peak at ∼790 nm for O-doping nonacenes N1-OH/OMe. By the thin-film-based organic field-effect transistor measurements, the relatively ordered O-doping pentacene P1-OMe possessed a hole transporting efficiency (μh) of 0.00406 cm-2 V-1 s-1 in in-air fabricated devices, while O-pentacene P1-PFB with two perfluorobutoxyl substituents witnessed an improved μh up to 0.0152 cm-2 V-1 s-1. In addition, one- or two-electron oxidation of O-pentacene/nonacene generated the corresponding radical cations or dications, in which electronic properties were dependent on the number of O-containing six-membered rings and quinoidal subunits. The study provided insights into the relationships between molecule structures and optoelectronic properties for the unique class of O-embedded PAHs.",Predicting Site-Binding Modes of Ions and Water to Nucleic Acids Using Molecular Solvation Theory.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30632365,Journal of the American Chemical Society,2019 05 01,"Site binding of ions and water shapes nucleic acids folding, dynamics, and biological function, complementing the more diffuse, nonspecific ""territorial"" ion binding. Unlike territorial binding, prediction of site-specific binding to nucleic acids remains an unsolved challenge in computational biophysics. This work presents a new toolset based on the 3D-RISM molecular solvation theory and topological analysis that predicts cation and water site binding to nucleic acids. 3D-RISM is shown to accurately capture alkali cations and water binding to the central channel, transversal loops, and grooves of the Oxytricha nova's telomeres' G-quadruplex ( Oxy-GQ), in agreement with high-resolution crystallographic data. To improve the computed cation occupancy along the Oxy-GQ central channel, it was necessary to refine and validate new cation-oxygen parameters using structural and thermodynamic data available for crown ethers and ion channels. This single set of parameters that describes both localized and delocalized binding to various biological systems is used to gain insight into cation occupancy along the Oxy-GQ channel under various salt conditions. The paper concludes with prospects for extending the method to predict divalent cation binding to nucleic acids. This work advances the forefront of theoretical methods able to provide predictive insight into ion atmosphere effects on nucleic acids function.",Modeling Dispersal of UV Filters in Estuaries.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30632364,Environmental science & technology,2019 02 05,"Lagrangian ocean analysis, where virtual parcels of water are tracked through hydrodynamic fields, provides an increasingly popular framework to predict the dispersal of water parcels carrying particles and chemicals. We conduct the first direct test of Lagrangian predictions for emerging contaminants using (1) the latitude, longitude, depth, sampling date, and concentrations of UV filters in raft cultured mussel ( Mytilus galloprovincialis) of the estuary Ria de Arousa, Spain (42.5°N, 8.9°W); (2) a hydrodynamic numerical model at 300 m spatial resolution; and (3) a Lagrangian dispersion scheme to trace polluted water parcels back to pollution sources. The expected dispersal distances (mean ± SD) are 2 ± 1 km and the expected dispersal times (mean ± SD) are 6 ± 2 h. Remarkably, the probability of dispersal of UV filters from potential sources to rafts decreases 5-fold over 5 km. In addition to predicting dispersal pathways and times, this study also provides a framework for quantitative investigations of concentrations of emerging contaminants and source apportionment using turbulent diffusion. In the coastline, the ranges of predicted concentrations of the UV-filters 4-methylbenzylidene-camphor, octocrylene, and benzophenone-4 are 3.2 × 10-4 to 0.023 ng/mL, 2.3 × 10-5 to 0.009 ng/mL, and 5.6 × 10-4 to 0.013 ng/mL, respectively.

The [2.2]paracyclophane introduces a three-dimensional perturbation into a nearly planar macrocyclic oligothiophene. The resulting helical structure is stabilized by two bulky substituents installed on the [2.2]paracyclophane unit. The increased enantiomerization barrier enabled the separation of both enantiomers. The synthesis of the target helical macrocycle 1 involves a sequence of halogenation and cross-coupling steps and a high-dilution strategy to close the macrocycle. Substituents tuning the energy of the enantiomerization process can be introduced in the last steps of the synthesis. The chiral target compound 1 was fully characterized by NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. The absolute configurations of the isolated enantiomers were assigned by comparing the data of circular dichroism spectroscopy with TD-DFT calculations. The enantiomerization dynamics was studied by dynamic HPLC and variable-temperature 2D exchange spectroscopy and supported by quantum-chemical calculations.,Tuning Charge Storage Properties of Supercapacitive Electrodes Evidenced by In Situ Gravimetric and Viscoelastic Explorations.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30632362,Analytical chemistry,2019 02 19,"Revealed by an integrated electrogravimetric and viscoelastic method, slightly electrochemically reduced graphene oxide (ERGO) presents an anion preference for charge storage and delivery, while with the progressive removal of oxygen functionalities on its basal planes, cations begin to predominate in charge compensation. This ""anion-to-cation"" evolution in neutral aqueous media can not only affect the electrochemical charge storage, but also play an important role in electrode's viscoelasticity. It was demonstrated that oxygen functionalities could modify the interactions between graphene layers and even contribute to pseudocapacitances. However, the role of oxygen functionalities in species transfer and viscoelastic variations still remains poorly understood. Herein, a combined methodology of electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM), ac-electrogravimetry and electroacoustic impedance measurements was proposed for characterizing the electrochemical and viscoelastic responses of graphene oxides with various degree of electrochemical reduction. With the removal of oxygen containing functional groups, ERGO electrode exhibits ( i) a gradually enhanced specific capacitance ( Cs) with increased flexibility (decreased storage moduli, G'); ( ii) a dehydration process of cations (i.e., from Na+·2H2O to Na+·H2O); and ( iii) a potential-dependent ""stiffened-softened"" behavior.

This difference represents a possible mechanism impacting upon the development of more complex social-communicative behaviors. The aim of this study was to develop and test the efficacy of a novel attention bias modification paradigm to alter social attention, specifically orienting to faces. Children with ASD (n = 66), aged between 5 and 12 years, were randomized to play either a social attention training or control game for 15 min. Children playing the training game were reinforced for attending to and engaging with social characters, whereas children in the control group were equally rewarded for attending to both social and non-social characters. Eye-tracking measures were obtained before and after gameplay. There was a significant increase in the percentage of first fixations to faces, relative to objects, after social attention training compared to a control group, associated with a medium effect size (partial η = 0.15). The degree of social attention change in the training group was inversely associated with restricted and repetitive behaviors and moderated by comorbid attention deficit hyperactivity disorder diagnoses, suggestive of differential training effects based on individual symptom profiles. By using the principles of attention bias modification, we demonstrated that social attention can be acutely modified in children with ASD, with an increased tendency to orient attention toward faces after brief social attention training. Modifying attentional biases may therefore represent a potential novel mechanism to alter the development of social communication trajectories. Autism Res 2019, 12: 527-535 © 2019 International Society for Autism Research, Wiley Periodicals, Inc. LAY SUMMARY: Some children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) do not look at faces or eyes as much as their non-ASD peers do. Using a game where players have to pay attention to characters with faces to score points, we found that children playing the game began to look more at faces, even outside of the game. Looking at faces is an important prerequisite to many social interactions, telling us about others' emotions and states of attention-things that become harder to understand when they are not seen. If children with ASD could use games to help train looking at faces in real life, then they may be in a better position to understand and participate in social exchanges.",Prediction of lung function using handgrip strength in healthy young adults.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30632320,Physiological reports,2019 01 18,"Positive association between physical activity and spirometry has been reported to be possibly attributed to handgrip strength (HGS), particularly in the elderly. However, the nature of the association between HGS and lung function in young adults is still unclear. This study investigated the prediction of lung function using HGS in young adults. A cross-sectional analytical study was carried out on four hundred (400) apparently healthy medical students who are aged 16-30 years. Handgrip strength (dominant and nondominant) and lung function (FEV1 , FVC and PEFR) of these students were assessed using Jamar dynamometer and a portable spirometer, respectively. Data were analyzed using inferential statistics. Independent t-test showed that the mean values of HGS and lung function of the males were significantly higher than the females (P < 0.0005). The relationship between HGS and lung function indices was significant (P < 0.0005) in all the participants but strongest for FEV1 (r = 0.64). The regression analysis showed that in addition to gender and height, HGS was a significant (P < 0.0005) predictor of lung function. Regression equations were also proposed for the prediction of these lung function indices using HGS, gender and height. This study is the first to report HGS as a significant predictor of pulmonary function in healthy young adults living in a low-resource country. Hence, its use could enhance medical practice in being an indicator of lung function status in healthy young adults.",Ultrathin Dual-Scale Nano- and Microporous Membranes for Vascular Transmigration Models.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30632319,"Small (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)",2019 06 10,"Selective cellular transmigration across the microvascular endothelium regulates innate and adaptive immune responses, stem cell localization, and cancer cell metastasis. Integration of traditional microporous membranes into microfluidic vascular models permits the rapid assay of transmigration events but suffers from poor reproduction of the cell permeable basement membrane. Current microporous membranes in these systems have large nonporous regions between micropores that inhibit cell communication and nutrient exchange on the basolateral surface reducing their physiological relevance. Here, the use of 100 nm thick continuously nanoporous silicon nitride membranes as a base substrate for lithographic fabrication of 3 µm pores is presented, resulting in a highly porous (≈30%), dual-scale nano- and microporous membrane for use in an improved vascular transmigration model. Ultrathin membranes are patterned using a precision laser writer for cost-effective, rapid micropore design iterations. The optically transparent dual-scale membranes enable complete observation of leukocyte egress across a variety of pore densities. A maximal density of ≈14 micropores per cell is discovered beyond which cell-substrate interactions are compromised giving rise to endothelial cell losses under flow. Addition of a subluminal extracellular matrix rescues cell adhesion, allowing for the creation of shear-primed endothelial barrier models on nearly 30% continuously porous substrates.",Predictive and prognostic value of circulating blood lymphocyte subsets in metastatic breast cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30632318,Cancer medicine,2019 03 08,"The treatment of breast cancer (BC) has improved greatly in recent years, however, the limitations of current therapeutic modalities underscore the need to define new prognostic tools and develop highly targeted therapies. The aims of the present study were to explore the effects of circulating blood lymphocyte subsets on the survival of metastatic breast cancer (MBC) patients and to evaluate their predictive and prognostic value. The clinical data of 482 patients with MBC were retrospectively analyzed, and patients were grouped according to molecular types of BC. The distribution of peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets at the time of first metastasis was examined by flow cytometry, and the distribution of lymphocyte subsets in each group was categorized into ''high or low'' subgroups using the upper quartile point as the cutoff. The relationship between the distribution of lymphocyte subsets and progression-free survival (PFS) as well as overall survival (OS) was evaluated in diverse molecular MBCs. In multivariate analysis, CD4+ was a negative independent predictor of PFS (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.538, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.313-0.926, P = 0.025) and CD3+ was a poor independent prognostic factor for OS (HR = 0.437, 95% CI = 0.248-0.772, P = 0.004) in the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive group. Neither the CD8+ , CD19+ , and CD56+ lymphocyte subsets nor the CD4+ /CD8+ ratio in peripheral blood was significant predictive or prognostic factors. In conclusion, higher circulating levels of CD4+ and CD3+ at first diagnosis in HER2-overexpressing MBC were significantly associated with worse survival outcomes. Low levels of plasma CD4+ and CD3+ were associated with increased anti-HER2 benefit in HER2-positive MBC. The present results indicate that these factors can be used as predictive and prognostic indicators of the outcome of patients with MBC.",Prognostic value of γ-glutamyltransferase-to-albumin ratio in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma following radical surgery.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30632317,Cancer medicine,2019 03 03,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a devastating malignancy with poor prognosis. Many preoperative biomarkers can predict postoperative survival of PDAC patients. In this study, we created a novel ratio index based on preoperative liver function test, γ-glutamyltransferase-to-albumin ratio (GAR), and evaluated its prognostic value in predicting clinical outcomes of PDAC patients following radical surgery. We retrospectively enrolled 833 PDAC patients who had underwent radical surgery at our institution between January 2010 and January 2017. Patients were divided into two groups according to the cut-off value of GAR. Univariate and multivariate survival analysis between the groups were evaluated. TNM stage, GAR, preoperative serum carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) and tumor differentiation were combined to generate a more accurate prognostic model. The optimal cut-off value of GAR was 0.65. Significant correlations were found between GAR and tumor location, tumor size, vascular invasion, obstructive jaundice, biliary drainage and parameters of liver function test. Univariate and multivariate analysis showed that high level of GAR independently predicted poorer postoperative overall survival (OS, P < 0.001) and recurrence-free survival (RFS, P < 0.001). Subgroup analysis demonstrated that GAR was predictive of survival in patients without biliary obstruction or severely impaired liver function. In addition, integration of GAR, preoperative serum CA19-9, and tumor differentiation into TNM staging system could better stratify the prognosis for PDAC patients compared with TNM stage alone. Our study demonstrates that preoperative GAR is an independent prognostic factor for prediction of surgical outcomes in PDAC patients. Combination of TNM stage, GAR, preoperative serum CA19-9, and tumor differentiation can enhance the prognostic accuracy.",RNA-Seq detects a SAMD12-EXT1 fusion transcript and leads to the discovery of an EXT1 deletion in a child with multiple osteochondromas.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30632316,Molecular genetics & genomic medicine,2019 05 31,"We describe a patient presenting with pachygyria, epilepsy, developmental delay, short stature, failure to thrive, facial dysmorphisms, and multiple osteochondromas.",3D Modeling of Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor and Tumor Necrosis Factor-bound Receptor Systems.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30632313,Molecular informatics,2019 04 23,"The interactions between the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and its receptor molecule are responsible for various signaling networks that are central to the functioning of human immune homeostasis. The present work is a computational study of certain structural aspects of this cell-signaling protein, specifically focusing on the molecular level analyses of the TNF receptor (TNF-R), guided by its crystallographic structure. We also examine the possible binding sites of the TNF onto TNF-R, and the associated interactions. The structural and conformational variations in the TNF-R and TNF bound TNF-R systems are examined in this context using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The time dependent variations of the dimeric TNF-R structures are compared with, and shown to be steadier than their isolated monomers. This dimeric stability is favored under acidic conditions. The results are used to further illustrate how 3D modeling and computer simulations can aid the structure-based approach to probing a ligand-receptor system.",Bone Marrow Stromal Cells Accelerate Hearing Recovery via Regeneration or Maintenance of Cochlear Fibrocytes in Mouse Spiral Ligaments.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30632312,"Anatomical record (Hoboken, N.J. : 2007)",2019 02 18,"Mammalian cochleae have limited capacity for regeneration, which is one of the major difficulties in the treatment of sensorineural hearing loss. In the current study, we examined the potential of bone marrow-derived stromal cells (BMSCs) for functional restoration of mouse cochleae through regeneration or maintenance of cochlear fibrocytes in the spiral ligament (SL). We used a mouse model of degeneration of cochlear fibrocytes in the SL using local application of 3-nitropropionic acid (3-NP), in which disruption of the gap junction network in the SL resulted in the reduction of the endocochlear potential (EP). Mouse BMSCs were infused into the posterior semicircular canal 7 days after 3-NP application. Transplanted BMSCs were frequently observed in the cochlear fluid space 4 weeks after transplantation, although a few transplants had migrated into the cochlear tissues including the SL. BMSC-treated cochleae exhibited higher cell densities in the SL and greater EP levels than the control ones. Immunohistochemistry further demonstrated the restoration of functional proteins in the SL. Significant recovery in thresholds of auditory brainstem responses following BMSC transplantation was found only at 40 kHz in a mild degeneration model. Our cumulative findings indicated that BMSCs accelerated regeneration or maintenance of fibrocytes in damaged SLs, leading to partial functional restoration of the mouse cochleae.

In rats, nicotine-seeking behavior is associated with alterations in glutamatergic plasticity within the nucleus accumbens core (NAcore). Specifically, cue-induced nicotine-seeking is associated with rapid, transient synaptic plasticity (t-SP) in glutamatergic synapses on NAcore medium spiny neurons. The goal of the present study was to determine if NAC reduces nicotine-seeking behavior and reverses reinstatement-associated NAcore glutamatergic alterations. Rats were extinguished from nicotine self-administration, followed by subchronic NAC administration (0 or 100 mg/kg/d) for 4 days prior to cue-induced reinstatement. NAcore synaptic potentiation was measured via dendritic spine morphology and mRNA and protein of relevant glutamatergic genes were quantified. Nicotine-seeking behavior was not reduced by subchronic NAC treatment. Also, NAcore transcript and protein expression of multiple glutamatergic genes, as well as spine morphological measures, were unaffected by subchronic NAC. Finally, chronic NAC treatment (15 days total) during extinction and prior to reinstatement significantly decreased extinction responding and reduced reinstatement of nicotine-seeking compared to vehicle. Together, these results suggest that chronic NAC treatment is necessary for its therapeutic efficacy as a treatment strategy for nicotine addiction and relapse.",Radiotherapy after surgery has significant survival benefits for patients with triple-negative breast cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30632300,Cancer medicine,2019 03 03,The value of adjuvant radiotherapy for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) has been controversial recently.

In many countries, considerable resources are invested in early intensive behavioral intervention (EIBI) programs for children with ASD, which aim to build adaptive skills and prevent or treat problem behavior. However, these programs vary widely in structure and delivery. Research evidence supports the efficacy of EIBI, but large knowledge gaps remain about the effectiveness of publicly funded EIBI programs. With policy-makers as formal research partners, we compared children's progress over 1 year in public preschool programs in adjacent Canadian provinces, New Brunswick (NB) and Nova Scotia (NS). In NB, children received up to 20 hr/week of comprehensive EIBI in a publicly funded, privately provided program. In NS, children received up to 15 hr/week of Pivotal Response Treatment and Positive Behavior Support delivered through the publicly funded healthcare system. In this observational parallel cohort study, we collected parent-reported data on 298 NB preschoolers (76.5% boys) and 221 NS preschoolers (86.9% boys) at EIBI start and 1 year later. Multilevel analysis revealed significant differences at baseline: NS children were older, with lower adaptive functioning and more severe ASD symptoms than NB children. Despite these pre-treatment differences that favor NB, children in both provinces showed similar adaptive functioning gains and reductions of maladaptive behavior. No changes were seen in mean ASD symptom severity in either province over time. Results highlight the value of evaluating interventions in their implementation contexts, and have important implications for devising optimal ASD policy.

LAY SUMMARY: We need to know more about the impact of different forms of early intensive behavioral intervention (EIBI) for young children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We showed that preschoolers with ASD gained important skills while in public EIBI programs in two Canadian provinces. We also saw that differences in how EIBI programs are structured and characteristics of children who are served may affect outcomes. For these reasons, policy making requires evidence that fits the local context.",Asthma is associated with increased probability of needing CPAP in children with severe obstructive sleep apnea.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30632298,Pediatric pulmonology,2019 02 11,Initiation of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) in children with severe obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is challenging and the distinct features of the subset of children requiring CPAP are poorly defined. Asthma often coexists with OSAS in children. The goal of this study was to explore the influence of asthma in the need for CPAP therapy in children with severe OSAS.,Automated control of inspired oxygen (FiO2 ) in preterm infants: Literature review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30632296,Pediatric pulmonology,2019 02 11,"The vast majority (95%) of very preterm infants receive oxygen-therapy monitored by oxygen pulse saturation (SpO2 ). However, they spend a significant percentage of time out of the SpO2 target with a high risk of severe complications such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). Recently, systems allowing the automated control of inspired oxygen (FiO2 ) for patient delivery to maintain target SpO2 has been become commercially available. We reviewed literature and individuated sixteen studies on the effectiveness of automated control of FiO2 in preterm infants. These studies demonstrate that automated devices are significantly more effective than manual control in maintaining target SpO2 and in preventing hyperoxia, while they seem to be less effective in preventing hypoxia. The studies were very heterogeneous for design, population size, duration, and device used, and this precludes firm conclusions regarding effectiveness and best setting of these systems. Moreover, none of the studies investigated if automated control of FiO2 can actually improve outcome in preterm infants. We conclude that further large-scale studies are warranted to assess the actual clinical relevance of these devices and to decide if they should become the standard of care.",The roles of NADPH oxidase in modulating neutrophil effector responses.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30632295,Molecular oral microbiology,2019 06 10,"Neutrophils are phagocytic innate immune cells essential for killing bacteria via activation of a wide variety of effector responses and generation of large amounts of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Majority of the ROS in neutrophils is generated by activation of the superoxide-generating enzyme nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase. Independent of their anti-microbial function, NADPH oxidase-derived ROS have emerged as key regulators of host immune responses and neutrophilic inflammation. Data from patients with inherited defects in the NADPH oxidase subunit alleles that ablate its enzyme function as well as mouse models demonstrate profound dysregulation of host inflammatory responses, neutrophil hyper-activation and tissue damage in response to microbial ligands or tissue trauma. A large body of literature now demonstrates how oxidants function as essential signaling molecules that are essential for the regulation of neutrophil responses during priming, degranulation, neutrophil extracellular trap formation, and apoptosis, independent of their role in microbial killing. In this review we summarize how NADPH oxidase-derived oxidants modulate neutrophil function in a cell intrinsic manner and regulate host inflammatory responses. In addition, we summarize studies that have elucidated possible roles of oxidants in neutrophilic responses within the oral mucosa and periodontal disease.",GsMTx4 reduces the reflex pressor response during dynamic hindlimb skeletal muscle stretch in decerebrate rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30632294,Physiological reports,2019 06 13,"Mechanical signals within contracting skeletal muscles contribute to the generation of the exercise pressor reflex; an important autonomic and cardiovascular control mechanism. In decerebrate rats, the mechanically activated channel inhibitor GsMTx4 was found to reduce the pressor response during static hindlimb muscle stretch; a maneuver used to investigate specifically the mechanical component of the exercise pressor reflex (i.e., the mechanoreflex). However, the effect was found only during the initial phase of the stretch when muscle length was changing and not during the later phase of stretch when muscle length was relatively constant. We tested the hypothesis that in decerebrate, unanesthetized rats, GsMTx4 would reduce the pressor response throughout the duration of a 30 sec, 1 Hz dynamic hindlimb muscle stretch protocol that produced repetitive changes in muscle length. We found that the injection of 10 μg of GsMTx4 into the arterial supply of a hindlimb reduced the peak pressor response (control: 15 ± 4, GsMTx4: 5 ± 2 mmHg, P < 0.05, n = 8) and the pressor response at multiple time points throughout the duration of the stretch. GsMTx4 had no effect on the pressor response to the hindlimb arterial injection of lactic acid which indicates the lack of local off-target effects. Combined with the recent finding that GsMTx4 reduced the pressor response only initially during static stretch in decerebrate rats, the present findings suggest that GsMTx4-sensitive channels respond primarily to mechanical signals associated with changes in muscle length. The findings add to our currently limited understanding of the channels that contribute to the activation of the mechanoreflex.",Twik-2-/- mouse demonstrates pulmonary vascular heterogeneity in intracellular pathways for vasocontractility.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30632293,Physiological reports,2019 02 16,"We have previously shown Twik-2-/- mice develop pulmonary hypertension and vascular remodeling. We hypothesized that distal pulmonary arteries (D-PAs) of the Twik-2-/- mice are hypercontractile under physiological venous conditions due to altered electrophysiologic properties between the conduit and resistance vessels in the pulmonary vascular bed. We measured resting membrane potential and intracellular calcium through Fura-2 in freshly digested pulmonary artery smooth muscles (PASMCs) from both the right main (RM-PA) and D-PA (distal) regions of pulmonary artery from WT and Twik-2-/- mice. Whole segments of RM-PAs and D-PAs from 20 to 24-week-old wildtype (WT) and Twik-2-/- mice were also pressurized between two glass micropipettes and bathed in buffer with either arterial or venous conditions. Abluminally-applied phenylephrine (PE) and U46619 were added to the buffer at log increments and vessel diameter was measured. All values were expressed as averages with ±SEM. Vasoconstrictor responses did not differ between WT and Twik-2-/- RM-PAs under arterial conditions. Under venous conditions, Twik-2-/- RM-PAs showed an increased sensitivity to PE with a lower EC50 (P = 0.02). Under venous conditions, Twik-2-/- D-PAs showed an increase maximal vasoconstrictor response to both phenylephrine and U46619 compared to the WT mice (P < 0.05). Isolated PASMCs from Twik-2 -/- D-PA were depolarized and had higher intracellular calcium levels compared to PASMCs from RM-PA of both WT and Twik-2-/- mice.

Herein, based on an integrated solid-state design by taking advantage of component-interaction between poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) and nanofumed silica in polymer matrix, a stable quasi-solid-state electrolyte (PS-QSE) for the Li-O2 battery is proposed. The as-assembled Li-O2 battery containing the PS-QSE exhibits effectively improved anodic reversibility (over 200 cycles, 850 h) and cycling stability of the battery (89 cycles, nearly 900 h). The improvement is attributed to the stability of the PS-QSE (including electrochemical, chemical, and mechanical stability), as well as the effective protection of lithium anode from aggressive soluble intermediates generated in cathode. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the interaction among the components plays a pivotal role in modulating the Li-ion conducting mechanism in the as-prepared PS-QSE. Moreover, the pouch-type PS-QSE based Li-O2 battery also shows wonderful flexibility, tolerating various deformations thanks to its integrated solid-state design. Furthermore, holes can be punched through the Li-O2 battery, and it can even be cut into any desired shape, demonstrating exceptional safety. Thus, this type of battery has the potential to meet the demands of tailorability and comformability in flexible and wearable electronics.",Biomorphic CoNC/CoOx Composite Derived from Natural Chloroplasts as Efficient Electrocatalyst for Oxygen Reduction Reaction.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30632276,"Small (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)",2019 02 22,"Natural chloroplasts containing big amounts of chlorophylls (magnesium porphyrin, Mg-Chl) are employed both as template and porphyrin source to synthesize biomorphic CoNC/CoOx composite as electrocatalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Cobalt-substituted chlorophyll derivative (Co-Chl) in chloroplasts is first obtained by successively rinsing in hydrochloric acid and cobalt acetate solutions. After calcining in nitrogen to 800 °C, Co-Chl is transferred to CoNC; while other parts of chloroplasts adsorbed with Co ions are transferred to CoOx retaining the microarchitecture of chloroplasts. The abundant active CoNC sites are protected by circumjacent biocarbon and CoOx to avoid leakage and agglomeration, and at the same time can overcome the poor conductivity weakness of CoOx by directly transporting electrons to the carbonaceous skeleton. This unique synergistic effect, together with efficient bioarchitecture, leads to good electrocatalytical performance for the ORR. The onset and half-wave potentials are 0.89 and 0.82 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode, respectively, with better durability and methanol tolerance than that of commercial Pt/C. Different from the traditional concept of biomorphic materials which simply utilize bioarchitectures, this work provides a new example of coupling bioderivative components with bioarchitectures into one integrated system to achieve good comprehensive performance for electrocatalysts.",Induced novel psbA mutation (Ala251 to Thr) in higher plants confers resistance to PSII inhibitor metribuzin in Lens culinaris.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30632275,Pest management science,2019 05 18,"Weed competition is a major limitation to worldwide lentil (Lens culinaris Medik.) production in part due to limited effective safe herbicide options.

The conjugated rapamycin can be released from the bioconjugate and prevent immune responses once the bioconjugate is uptaken by antigen-presenting cells. The immunomodulatory bioconjugate significantly reduced the titers of ADAs compared with a PEGylated protein.

In this study, the functional and biophysical characteristics of aggressive and lethal inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) CSCs at the single-cell level are comprehensively profiled using multiple microengineered tools. Distinct functional (cell migration, growth, adhesion, invasion and self-renewal) and biophysical (cell deformability, adhesion strength and contractility) properties of ALDH+ SUM149 IBC CSCs are found as compared to their ALDH- non-CSC counterpart, providing biophysical insights into why CSCs has an enhanced propensity to metastasize. It is further shown that the cellular biophysical phenotype can predict and determine IBC cells' tumorigenic ability. SUM149 and SUM159 IBC cells selected and modulated through biophysical attributes-adhesion and stiffness-show characteristics of CSCs in vitro and enhance tumorigenicity in in vivo murine models of primary tumor growth. Overall, the multiparametric cellular biophysical phenotyping and modulation of IBC CSCs yields a new understanding of IBC's metastatic properties and how they might develop and be targeted for therapeutic interventions."

The 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide (4-NQO)-induced murine oral and esophageal cancer model is frequently used to assess the effects of preventive and/or therapeutic agents. We used this model to assess the impact of the microbiome on tumorigenesis using axenic (germ-free) and conventionally housed mice. Increased toxicity was observed in germ-free mice, however, no difference in tumor incidence, multiplicity, and size was observed. Transcriptional profiling of liver tissue from germ-free and conventionally housed mice identified 254 differentially expressed genes including ten cytochrome p450 enzymes, the largest family of phase-1 drug metabolizing enzymes in the liver. Gene ontology revealed that differentially expressed genes were enriched for liver steatosis, inflammation, and oxidative stress in livers of germ-free mice. Our observations emphasize the importance of the microbiome in mediating chemical toxicity at least in part by altering host gene expression. Studies on the role of the microbiome in chemical-induced cancer using germ-free animal models should consider the potential difference in dose due to the microbiome-mediated changes in host metabolizing capacity, which might influence the ability to draw conclusions especially for tumor induction models that are dose dependent.",Evaluation of clinical frailty screening in geriatric acute care.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30632249,Journal of evaluation in clinical practice,2019 01 11,"While frailty status is an attractive risk stratification tool, the evaluation of frailty in acute care can be challenging as some inpatients are unable to complete performance-based tests as part of frailty assessment and some tools may lack discriminative ability and categorize majority of cohorts as ""frail"".

The parasite employs a wide variety of regulatory mechanisms to complete their life cycle and survive inside hosts. Among them, epigenetic-mediated mechanisms have been implicated for controlling chromatin organization, gene regulation, morphological differentiation, and antigenic variation. The differential gene expression in parasite is largely dependent on the nature of the chromatin structure. The histone core methylation marks and methyl mark readers contribute to chromatin dynamics. Here, we review the recent developments on various epigenetic marks and its enzymes in the Plasmodium falciparum, how these marks play a key role in the regulation of transcriptional activity of variable genes and coordinate the differential gene expression.

Comparative transcriptomics analysis has been widely applied to explore the antiviral mechanism in resistant strains. Here, to identify genes involved in BmNPV infection, we identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and performed weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) between two Bombyx mori strains: strain 871 (susceptible to BmNPV infection) and the near-isogenic strain 871C (resistant to BmNPV). Our results showed that 400 genes were associated with resistance in strain 871C, and 76 genes were related to susceptibility in strain 871. In addition, the correlation analysis of DEGs and WGCNA showed that 40 genes related to resistance were highly expressed in the resistant strain.

We further identified the effect of gene BGIBMGA004291, which encoded a multiprotein bridge factor 2 (MBF2) family member (MBF2-10), on viral infection in cells. Our data suggested that MBF2-10 inhibited viral infection. Taken together, this study showed specific module trait correlations related to viral infection in strains 871 and 871C, and we identified a resistance-related gene.

When expressed in COS7 cells, TMCO5A was found to be distributed in the endoplasmic reticulum-nuclear membrane (ER-NM) of cells as a membrane-associated protein, while TMCO5AΔC lacking the transmembrane region (TM) mislocalized and diffused throughout the cytoplasm. The result suggested that TM is responsible for the retention of TMCO5A at the ER-NM. Immunocytochemical and immunoblotting analyses indicated that TMCO5A was localized along the posterior part of the nuclei in both round and elongated rat spermatids but disappeared from epididymal spermatozoa. Double immunolabeling of isolated spermatids with the anti-TMCO5A and the anti-β tubulin antibodies showed that TMCO5A was always found to be closely associated with developing manchette microtubules but did not completely colocalize with them. On the other hand, we found that almost all TMCO5A colocalized with SUN4, a linker of nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton complex protein present at the posterior part of spermatid nuclei. These data suggested that TMCO5A is located closer to the nuclei than the manchette microtubules.

Group 3 and Group 4 medulloblastomas are also known to have elevated levels of histone H3-lysine 27-tri-methylation (H3K27me3), at least in part due to high expression of the H3K27 methyltransferase enhancer of zest homologue 2 (EZH2), which can be regulated by MYC. We therefore examined whether MYC expression is associated with elevated EZH2 and H3K27me3 in medulloblastoma, and if high-MYC medulloblastomas are particularly sensitive to pharmacological EZH2 blockade. Western blot analysis of low (DAOY, UW228, CB SV40) and high (DAOY-MYC, UW228-MYC, CB-MYC, D425) MYC cell lines showed that higher levels of EZH2 and H3K27me3 were associated with elevated MYC. In fixed medulloblastoma samples examined using immunohistochemistry, most MYC positive tumors also had high H3K27me3, but many MYC negative ones did as well, and the correlation was not statistically significant. All high MYC lines tested were sensitive to the EZH2 inhibitor EPZ6438. Many low MYC lines also grew more slowly in the presence of EPZ6438, although DAOY-MYC cells responded more strongly than parent DAOY cultures with lower MYC levels. We find that higher MYC levels are associated with increased EZH2, and pharmacological blockade of EZH2 is a potential therapeutic strategy for aggressive medulloblastoma with elevated MYC.",Valerian extract alters functional brain connectivity: A randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30632220,Phytotherapy research : PTR,2019 06 13,"Valerian root is the most commonly used herbal supplement for sedation and anxiolysis, but it is unknown whether it may affect functional brain connectivity.

This 4-week, double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted with 64 nonclinical volunteers suffering psychological stress. The participants received VRE (100 mg) or a placebo thrice daily. We examined VRE's therapeutic effects on anxiety and stress-related psychological constructs. Functional brain connectivity changes were measured as EEG coherence in the alpha and theta frequency bands. The VRE and placebo groups both exhibited significant postintervention improvements on all clinical scales, but no significant between-group differences in these changes were noted. Compared with the placebo group, the VRE group exhibited significantly greater increases in frontal brain region alpha coherence across four electrode pairs, and these changes were significantly correlated with anxiolysis. The VRE group also exhibited significantly greater decreases in theta coherence across another four electrodes pairs. Our findings indicate that VRE alters functional brain connectivity in relation to anxiety.

The MUC5AC mucin gene expression was measured by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Production of MUC5AC mucin protein was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. To elucidate the action mechanism of obtusifolin, effect of obtusifolin on PMA-induced nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathway was investigated by western blot analysis. Obtusin, obtusifolin, or cassiaside inhibited the expression of MUC5AC mucin gene and the production of MUC5AC mucin protein, induced by EGF, PMA, or TNF-α. Obtusifolin inhibited PMA-induced activation (phosphorylation) of inhibitory kappa B kinase, and thus phosphorylation and degradation of inhibitory kappa B alpha. Obtusifolin inhibited PMA-induced nuclear translocation of NF-κB p65.

The second issue from neutron irradiation is the high radioactivity gain of iron-rich samples such as pyrite, and the third is the production of interference nuclides during irradiation. The inherent drawbacks of conventional K-Ar and current unspiked K-Ar dating make it difficult to assess the reliability of age results."

Viability and apoptosis of HaCaT cells were assessed using MTT assay and Annexin V-FITC/PI staining, respectively. Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was performed to measure the expression of microRNA-122 (miR-122) in HaCaT cells. Cell transfection was conducted to up-regulate the expression of miR-122. Western blotting was used to detect the protein expression levels of key factors involved in cell apoptosis, inflammatory response, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) pathways. We found that LPS treatment induced HaCaT cell inflammatory injury by inhibiting cell viability, promoting cell apoptosis, and enhancing the protein expression levels of cyclooxygenase 2 and inducible nitric oxide synthase. TAN treatment relieved LPS-induced HaCaT cell inflammatory injury. Moreover, TAN treatment attenuated LPS-induced activation of JNK and NF-κB pathways in HaCaT cells. Furthermore, TAN treatment alleviated LPS-induced up-regulation of miR-122. Overexpression of miR-122 reversed the effects of TAN on LPS-induced HaCaT cell inflammatory injury and activation of JNK and NF-κB pathways. In conclusion, TAN exerted anti-inflammatory and protective effects on keratinocytes injury. TAN relieved LPS-induced inflammatory injury of human HaCaT cells via down-regulating miR-122 and then inactivating JNK and NF-κB pathways.",Chronic immobilization stress primes the hippocampal opioid system for oxycodone-associated learning in female but not male rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30632204,"Synapse (New York, N.Y.)",2019 03 15,"In adult female, but not male, Sprague Dawley rats, chronic immobilization stress (CIS) increases mossy fiber (MF) Leu-Enkephalin levels and redistributes delta- and mu-opioid receptors (DORs and MORs) in hippocampal CA3 pyramidal cells and GABAergic interneurons to promote excitation and learning processes following subsequent opioid exposure. Here, we demonstrate that CIS females, but not males, acquire conditioned place preference (CPP) to oxycodone and that CIS ""primes"" the hippocampal opioid system in females for oxycodone-associated learning. In CA3b, oxycodone-injected (Oxy) CIS females relative to saline-injected (Sal) CIS females exhibited an increase in the cytoplasmic and total densities of DORs in pyramidal cell dendrites so that they were similar to Sal- and Oxy-CIS males. Consistent with our earlier studies, Sal- and Oxy-CIS females but not CIS males had elevated DOR densities in MF-CA3 dendritic spines, which we have previously shown are important for opioid-mediated long-term potentiation. In the dentate gyrus, Oxy-CIS females had more DOR-labeled interneurons than Sal-CIS females. Moreover, Sal- and Oxy-CIS females compared to both groups of CIS males had elevated levels of DORs and MORs in GABAergic interneuron dendrites, suggesting capacity for greater synthesis or storage of these receptors in circuits important for opioid-mediated disinhibition. However, more plasmalemmal MORs were on large parvalbumin-containing dendrites of Oxy-CIS males compared to Sal-CIS males, suggesting a limited ability for increased granule cell disinhibition. These results suggest that low levels of DORs in MF-CA3 synapses and hilar GABAergic interneurons may contribute to the attenuation of oxycodone CPP in males exposed to CIS.",Brain aging: A Ianus-faced player between health and neurodegeneration.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30632202,Journal of neuroscience research,2019 01 11,"Neurodegenerative diseases are incurable debilitating disorders characterized by structural and functional neuronal loss. Approximately 30 million people are affected worldwide, and this number is predicted to reach more than 150 million by 2050. Neurodegenerative disorders include Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and prion diseases among others. These disorders are characterized by the accumulation of aggregating proteins forming amyloid, responsible for the disease-associated pathological lesions. The aggregation of amyloidogenic proteins can result either in gaining of toxic functions, derived from the damage provoked by these deposits in affected tissue, or in a loss of functions, due to the sequestration and the consequent inability of the aggregating protein to ensure its physiological role. While it is widely accepted that aging represents the main risk factor for neurodegeneration, there is still no clear cut-off line between the two conditions. Indeed, many of the pathways that are commonly altered in neurodegeneration-misfolded protein accumulation, chronic inflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, impaired iron homeostasis, epigenetic modifications-have been often correlated also with healthy aging. This overlap could be explained by the fact that the continuous accumulation of cellular damages, together with a progressive decline in metabolic efficiency during aging, makes the neurons more vulnerable to toxic injuries. When a given threshold is exceeded, all these alterations might give rise to pathological phenotypes that ultimately lead to neurodegeneration.",Disease features of equine coronavirus and enteric salmonellosis are similar in horses.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30632200,Journal of veterinary internal medicine,2019 04 29,"Equine coronavirus (ECoV) is an emerging pathogen associated with fever and enteric disease in adult horses.

Many clinical and histopathological studies seem to support this concept. Dysplastic nevus originally proposed by Clark's group is a key entity of the intermediate lesion between benign nevus and melanoma. The latest edition of the WHO Classification of Skin Tumours (2018) has excluded Clark nevus (dysplastic nevus of mild atypia) from dysplastic nevus, the latter being now classified into the low- and high-grade by the degrees of nuclear atypia. The World Health Organization classification regards dysplastic nevus of both grades as the intermediate lesion between common acquired nevus and the radial growth-phase melanoma. An extensive genetic study recently performed by Bastian's group indicated the existence of intermediate lesions between nevus and melanoma. In spite of these findings, some investigators doubt the concept of the intermediate lesions including dysplastic nevus and insist that the majority of melanomas arise de novo as melanoma in situ, not in association with a preceding nevus. The concept of de novo genesis of melanoma may be supported by a recent meta-analysis study revealing that 71% of melanomas likely arose de novo and 29% from pre-existing nevus. In this review article, from the viewpoint of de novo genesis of melanoma, the author critically discusses the relevant findings of melanoma genesis and proposes a new framework to interpret the morphological and genetic data alternatively.

A longitudinal relaxation optimization scheme to enhance the signal sensitivity of HSQC experiments in SSNMR spectroscopy is reported. Under the proposed scheme, the 1 H spins of 1 H-X (15 N or 13 C) are selected for signal acquisition, whereas other vast 1 H spins are flipped back to the axis of the static magnetic field to accelerate the spin recovery of the observed 1 H spins, resulting in enhanced sensitivity. Three biological systems are used to evaluate this strategy, including a seven-transmembrane protein, an RNA, and a whole-cell sample. For all three samples, the proposed scheme largely shortens the effective 1 H longitudinal relaxation time and results in a 1.3-2.5-fold gain in sensitivity. The selected systems are representative of challenging biological systems for observation by means of SSNMR spectroscopy; thus indicating the general applicability of this method, which is particularly important for biological samples with a short lifetime or with limited sample quantities.",The effectiveness of Korean herbal medicine in infertile men with poor semen quality: A prospective observational pilot study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30632194,Andrologia,2019 04 03,"We examined the effects and safety of Korean herbal medicine (MYOMI-14) to treat infertile men with low semen quality.

In this paper, we present a kernel ELM Cox model regularized by an L0 -based broken adaptive ridge (BAR) penalization method. Then, we demonstrate that the resulting method, referred to as ELMCoxBAR, can outperform some other state-of-art survival prediction methods such as L1 - or L2 -regularized Cox regression, random survival forest with various splitting rules, and boosted Cox model, in terms of its predictive performance using both simulated and real world datasets.

We investigated the viscoelastic focusing dynamics using polystyrene (PS) beads and human red blood cells (RBCs) suspended in the viscoelastic fluid.

However, its utility has recently been questioned, and a surprising lack of coordination between the dynamics of ΨL and gs across biomes has been reported. Here, we offer a more expanded view of the isohydricity concept that considers effects of vapour pressure deficit (VPD) and leaf area index (AL ) on the apparent sensitivities of ΨL and gs to drought. After validating the model with tree- and ecosystem-scale data, we find that within a site, isohydricity is a strong predictor of limitations to stomatal function, though variation in VPD and leaf area, among other factors, can challenge its diagnosis. Across sites, the theory predicts that the degree of isohydricity is a good predictor of the sensitivity of gs to declining soil water in the absence of confounding effects from other drivers. However, if VPD effects are significant, they alone are sufficient to decouple the dynamics of ΨL and gs entirely. We conclude with a set of practical recommendations for future applications of the isohydricity framework within and across sites.",A new stability indicating reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography method for the determination of enantiomeric purity of a DPP-4 inhibitor drug linagliptin.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30632171,Electrophoresis,2019 04 01,"A simple, sensitive, and stability indicating isocratic reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography method has been developed, optimized and validated for the separation and quantification of S-enantiomer in linagliptin (R-enantiomer) drug substance.

Antimicrobial treatment remains the primary means of control; however, there are limited choices available for use. The objectives of the study were therefore to determine the minimum inhibitory concentrations for erythromycin and florfenicol in selected F. psychrophilum isolates and to evaluate their clinical treatment efficacy in experimentally infected rainbow trout. All isolates tested had moderate susceptibility to florfenicol and erythromycin except one isolate, which had low susceptibility to erythromycin. Two isolates (one with moderate and one with low susceptibility to erythromycin) were used in an experimental infection trial.

We suggest that dissecting plant plasticity in response to increasing temperature needs an approach that can represent plasticity over multiple environments, and considers both population-level responses and the variation between genotypes in their response. Here, we outline how a random regression mixed model framework can be applied to plastic traits that show linear or nonlinear responses to temperature. Random regressions provide a powerful and efficient means of characterising plasticity and its variation. Although they have been used widely in other fields, they have only recently been implemented in plant evolutionary ecology. We outline their structure and provide an example tutorial of their implementation.",Determining effectiveness of EBM education in otolaryngology residents using modified fresno test.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30632168,The Laryngoscope,2019 01 11,"To determine the effectiveness of education in evidence-based medicine (EBM) on the knowledge, competency, and skills of otolaryngology residents of Tehran University of Medical Sciences (TUMS) at Amir-Alam and Imam Khomeini Hospitals.",Neutrophil elastase plays a non-redundant role in remodeling the venular basement membrane and neutrophil diapedesis post-ischemia/reperfusion injury.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30632166,The Journal of pathology,2019 04 10,"Ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury is a severe inflammatory insult associated with numerous pathologies, such as myocardial infarction, stroke and acute kidney injury. I/R injury is characterized by a rapid influx of activated neutrophils secreting toxic free radical species and degrading enzymes that can irreversibly damage the tissue, thus impairing organ functions. Significant efforts have been invested in identifying therapeutic targets to suppress neutrophil recruitment and activation post-I/R injury. In this context, pharmacological targeting of neutrophil elastase (NE) has shown promising anti-inflammatory efficacy in a number of experimental and clinical settings of I/R injury and is considered a plausible clinical strategy for organ care. However, the mechanisms of action of NE, and hence its inhibitors, in this process are not fully understood. Here we conducted a comprehensive analysis of the impact of NE genetic deletion on neutrophil infiltration in four murine models of I/R injury as induced in the heart, kidneys, intestine and cremaster muscle. In all models, neutrophil migration into ischemic regions was significantly suppressed in NE-/- mice as compared with wild-type controls. Analysis of inflamed cremaster muscle and mesenteric microvessels by intravital and confocal microscopy revealed a selective entrapment of neutrophils within venular walls, most notably at the level of the venular basement membrane (BM) following NE deletion/pharmacological blockade. This effect was associated with the suppression of NE-mediated remodeling of the low matrix protein expressing regions within the venular BM used by transmigrating neutrophils as exit portals. Furthermore, whilst NE deficiency led to reduced neutrophil activation and vascular leakage, levels of monocytes and prohealing M2 macrophages were reduced in tissues of NE-/- mice subjected to I/R. Collectively our results identify a vital and non-redundant role for NE in supporting neutrophil breaching of the venular BM post-I/R injury but also suggest a protective role for NE in promoting tissue repair. © 2019 The Authors.

The two temporal visual areas are strongly interconnected, but area 20a is primarily connected to the occipital visual areas, whereas area 20b maintains more widespread connections with the occipital, parietal and suprasylvian visual areas and the secondary auditory cortex. The callosal connectivity, although homotopic, consists mainly of very weak anterograde labeling which was more widespread in area 20a than area 20b. Although areas 20a and 20b are well connected with the visual dorsal thalamus, the injection into area 20a resulted in more anterograde label, whereas more retrograde label was observed in the visual thalamus following the injection into area 20b. Most interestingly, comparisons to previous connectional studies of cat areas 20a and 20b reveal a common pattern of connectivity of the temporal visual cortex in carnivores, where the posterior parietal cortex and the central temporal region (PMLS) provide network points required for dorsal and ventral stream interaction enroute to integration in the prefrontal cortex. This pattern of network connectivity is not dissimilar to that observed in primates, which highlights the ferret as a useful animal model to understand visual sensory integration between the dorsal and ventral streams. The data generated will also contribute to a connectomics database, to facilitate cross species analysis of brain connectomes and wiring principles of the brain.",TRPV4 is involved in levonorgestrel-induced reduction in oviduct ciliary beating.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30632164,The Journal of pathology,2019 04 10,"Previous studies revealed the increasing risk of tubal pregnancy following failure of levonorgestrel (LNG)-induced emergency contraception, which was attributed to the reduced ciliary motility in response to LNG. However, understanding of the mechanism of LNG-induced reduction in the ciliary beat frequency (CBF) is limited. The transient receptor potential vanilloid (TRPV) 4 channel is located widely in the female reproductive tract and generates an influx of Ca2+ following its activation under normal physiological conditions, which regulates the CBF. The present study aimed to explore whether LNG reduced the CBF in the Fallopian tubes by modulating TRPV4 channels, leading to embryo retention in the Fallopian tubes and subsequent tubal pregnancy. The study provided evidence that the expression of TRPV4 was downregulated in the Fallopian tubes among patients with tubal pregnancy and negatively correlated with the serum level of progesterone. LNG downregulated the expression of TRPV4, limiting the calcium influx to reduce the CBF in mouse oviducts. Furthermore, the distribution of ciliated cells and the morphology of cilia did not change following the administration of LNG. LNG-induced reduction in the CBF and embryo retention in the Fallopian tubes and in mouse oviducts were partially reversed by the progesterone receptor antagonist RU486 or the TRPV4 agonist 4α-phorbol 12,13-didecanoate (4α-PDD). The results indicated that LNG could downregulate the expression of TRPV4 to reduce the CBF in both humans and mice, suggesting the possible mechanism of tubal pregnancy. © 2019 The Authors.

Previously, we found that the function of miR398b in immunity in rice differs from that in Arabidopsis. However, the underlying mechanisms are unclear. In this study, we characterized the mutants of miR398b target genes and demonstrated that multiple superoxide dismutase genes contribute to miR398b-regulated rice immunity against the blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae. Out of the four target genes of miR398b, mutations in Cu/Zn-Superoxidase Dismutase1 (CSD1), CSD2 and Os11g09780 (Superoxide DismutaseX, SODX) led to enhanced resistance to M. oryzae and increased hydrogen peroxide (H2 O2 ) accumulation. By contrast, mutations in Copper Chaperone for Superoxide Dismutase (CCSD) resulted in enhanced susceptibility. Biochemical studies revealed that csd1, csd2 and sodx displayed altered expression of CSDs and other superoxide dismutase (SOD) family members, leading to increased total SOD enzyme activity that positively contributed to higher H2 O2 production. By contrast, the ccsd mutant showed CSD protein deletion, resulting in decreased CSD and total SOD enzyme activity. Our results demonstrate the roles of different SODs in miR398b-regulated resistance to rice blast disease, and uncover an integrative regulatory network in which miR398b boosts total SOD activity to upregulate H2 O2 concentration and thereby improve disease resistance."
