They are also promising candidates for antifogging coatings; however, researchers have yet to devise a suitable method for coating glass substrates with zeolite-based films. Here, we report on a direct wet deposition technique that is capable of casting zeolite films on glass substrates without exposing the glass to highly basic solutions or the vapors used in zeolite synthesis. We began by preparing cast solutions of pure silica zeolite MFI synthesized in hydrothermal reactions of various durations. The solutions were then applied to glass substrates via spin-on deposition to form zeolite films. The resulting zeolite MFI thin films were characterized in terms of transmittance to visible light, surface topography, thin film morphology, and crystallinity. Wetting and antifogging properties were also probed. We found that hydrophilicity and antifogging capability increased with the degree of thin film crystallinity. We also determined that the presence of the amorphous silica in the thin films is critical to transparency. Fabricating high-performance zeolite-based antifogging coatings requires an appropriate composition of zeolite crystals and amorphous silica.",Nanolamellar Tantalum Interfaces in the Osteoblast Adhesion.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30673289,Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids,2019 02 19,"The design of topographically patterned surfaces is considered to be a preferable approach for influencing cellular behavior in a controllable manner, in particular to improve the osteogenic ability of bone regeneration. In this study, we fabricated nanolamellar tantalum (Ta) surfaces with lamellar wall thicknesses of 40 and 70 nm. The cells attached to nanolamellar Ta surfaces exhibited higher protein adsorption and expression of β1 integrin, as compared to the nonstructured bulk Ta, which facilitated the initial cell attachment and spreading. We thus, as expected, observed significantly enhanced osteoblast adhesion, growth, and alkaline phosphatase activity on nanolamellar Ta surfaces. However, the beneficial effects of nanolamellar structures on osteogenesis became weaker as the lamellar wall thickness increased. The interaction between cells and Ta surfaces was examined through adhesion forces using atomic force microscopy. Our findings indicated that the Ta surface with a lamellar wall thickness of 40 nm exhibited the strongest stimulatory effect. The observed strongest adhesion force between the cell-attached tip and the Ta surface with a 40 nm thick lamellar wall encouraged the much stronger binding of cells with the surface and thus well-attached, -stretched, and -grown cells. We attributed this to the increase in the available contact area of cells with the thinner nanolamellar Ta surface. The increased contact area allowed the enhancement of the cell surface interaction strength and, thus, improved osteoblast adhesion. This study suggests that the thin nanolamellar topography shows immense potential in improving the clinical performance of dental and orthopedic implants.",Interfacial Behavior of Fumonisin B1 Toxin and Its Degradation on the Membrane.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30673288,Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids,2019 02 19,"Fumonisin B1 (FB1), the most abundant component of the fumonisin family, is highly responsible for fungal infections. In this paper, our main aim is to study the surface chemistry and spectroscopic properties of the FB1 molecule and observe the impact of green LED light on the FB1 Langmuir monolayer. From the surface chemistry and spectroscopic studies, we found that the FB1 molecule forms a self-assembled Langmuir monolayer which is sufficient to mimic its interaction with the corneal tissues. The irradiation of green LED light on the FB1 Langmuir monolayer showed the degradation of the FB1 when compared to that in the absence of light. This observation reveals that FB1 molecules lose their tendency to stay as a Langmuir monolayer. The degradation observed on the interface was compared with the bulk phase of FB1. The bulk phase observation also indicated the degradation tendency which reinforced the observed interfacial property of FB1.",Controllable Self-Assembly of Amphiphilic Tadpole-Shaped Polymer Single-Chain Nanoparticles Prepared through Intrachain Photo-cross-linking.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30673287,Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids,2019 02 19,"We report the use of intramolecular cross-linking chemistry as a tool to control the self-assembly of amphiphilic diblock copolymers (di-BCPs). Two amphiphilic di-BCPs of poly( N, N'-dimethylacrylamide)- block-polystyrene (PDMA- b-PS) with photo-cross-linkable cinnamoyl groups in either hydrophobic or hydrophilic blocks were prepared using reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer polymerization. Intramolecular photo-cross-linking of cinnamoyl groups led to the formation of tadpole-shaped polymer single-chain nanoparticles (SCNPs) consisting of a self-collapsed block as the ""head"" and an un-cross-linked block as the ""tail"". When intramolecular photo-cross-linking was carried out in hydrophobic PS blocks, a clear morphological transition from branched cylindrical micelles (for the linear di-BCP) to completely spherical micelles at a dimerization degree of ∼63% was observed. A pattern of morphological transitions from cylindrical micelles to spherical micelles is observed through stepwise downsizing the length of cylindrical micelles when increasing the self-collapse degree of PS blocks, whereas, in case of photo-cross-linking carried out in hydrophilic PDMA blocks, the size of micelles showed a dramatic increase due to the shift of hydrophobic-to-hydrophilic balance. When the cross-linking degree of PDMA blocks reached >60%, tadpole-shaped SCNPs assembled into nonconventional aggregates with a nonsmooth surface. Our results illustrate the impact of chain topologies on the self-assembly outcomes of amphiphilic di-BCPs, which likely opens a door to control the micellar morphologies from just one parent linear di-BCP, rather than resynthesizing BPCs with different volume fractions of the two blocks.",Motility of Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 Allows for Nitrate Reduction in the Toxic Region of a Ciprofloxacin Concentration Gradient in a Microfluidic Reactor.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30673286,Environmental science & technology,2019 03 05,"Subsurface environments often contain mixtures of contaminants in which the microbial degradation of one pollutant may be inhibited by the toxicity of another. Agricultural settings exemplify these complex environments, where antimicrobial leachates may inhibit nitrate bioreduction, and are the motivation to address this fundamental ecological response. In this study, a microfluidic reactor was fabricated to create diffusion-controlled concentration gradients of nitrate and ciprofloxacin under anoxic conditions in order to evaluate the ability of Shewanella oneidenisis MR-1 to reduce the former in the presence of the latter. Results show a surprising ecological response, where swimming motility allow S. oneidensis MR-1 to accumulate and maintain metabolic activity for nitrate reduction in regions with toxic ciprofloxacin concentrations (i.e., 50× minimum inhibitory concentration, MIC), despite the lack of observed antibiotic resistance. Controls with limited nutrient flux and a nonmotile mutant (Δ flag) show that cells cannot colonize antibiotic rich microenvironments, and this results in minimal metabolic activity for nitrate reduction. These results demonstrate that under anoxic, nitrate-reducing conditions, motility can control microbial habitability and metabolic activity in spatially heterogeneous toxic environments.",Porous Eleocharis@MnPE Layered Hybrid for Synergistic Adsorption and Catalytic Biodegradation of Toxic Azo Dyes from Industrial Wastewater.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30673285,Environmental science & technology,2019 02 19,"The effective treatment of industrial wastewater to protect freshwater reserves for the survival of life is a primary focus of current research. Herein, a multicomponent Eleocharis-manganese peroxidase enzyme (Eleocharis@MnPE) layered hybrid with high surface area (1200 m2/m3), with a strong synergistic adsorption and catalytic biodegradation (SACB), has been developed through a facile method. A combination of outer porous (Eleocharis) and inner catalytically active (MnPE) components of the hybrid resulted in highly efficient SACB system, evidenced by high removal rate of 15 kg m-3 day-1 (100%) and complete degradation of toxic Orange II (OR) azo dye into nontoxic products (gases and weak acids). The Eleocharis@MnPE layered hybrid efficiently degraded both OR in synthetic wastewater and also other azo dyes (red, pink, and yellow dyes) present in three different textile industrial effluents. For the industrial effluents, these were evidenced by the color disappearance and reduction in biological oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD), and total organic carbon (TOC) of up to 97%, 92%, and 76%, respectively. Furthermore, reduced toxicity of treated wastewater was confirmed by decreased cell toxicity to 0.1%-1% and increased cell viability to 90%. We believe that designing a hybrid system with strong ability of SACB could be highly effective for industrial-scale treatment of wastewater.",Probing Nanoparticle Geometry down to Subnanometer Size: The Benefits of Vibrational Spectroscopy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30673284,The journal of physical chemistry letters,2019 02 15,"Understanding the role of nanoparticle size and shape in the binding of molecules is very relevant for heterogeneous catalysis and molecular electronics. The geometry of Pd nanoparticles (NPs) has been studied from very small clusters containing 4 atoms up to large (>500 atoms), well-faceted NPs. Their geometry was retrieved by combining scanning tunneling microscopy and vibrational sum frequency generation (SFG) spectroscopy of adsorbed CO. SFG has been revealed to be highly sensitive to the geometry of NPs smaller than 100 atoms by identifying the nature of CO adsorption sites. NP growth could be followed layer by layer in the critical size range corresponding to the transition from a nonmetallic to a metallic state and to oscillations of CO adsorption energy. NP height remained at two Pd planes up to 30 atoms, and adsorption energy minima correspond to the completion of successive layers.",Development of Large-Scale Excited-State Calculations Based on the Divide-and-Conquer Time-Dependent Density Functional Tight-Binding Method.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30673283,Journal of chemical theory and computation,2019 03 12,"In this study, the divide-and-conquer (DC) method was extended to time-dependent density functional tight-binding (TDDFTB) theory to enable excited-state calculations of large systems and is denoted by DC-TDDFTB. The efficient diagonalization algorithms of TDDFTB and DC-TDDFTB methods were implemented into our in-house program. Test calculations of polyethylene aldehyde and p-coumaric acid, a pigment in photoactive yellow protein, in water demonstrate the high accuracy and efficiency of the developed DC-TDDFTB method. Furthermore, the (TD)DFTB metadynamics simulations of acridinium in the ground and excited states give reasonable p Ka values compared with the corresponding experimental values.",Effect of the Molecular Weight of Poly(2-methoxyethyl acrylate) on Interfacial Structure and Blood Compatibility.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30673282,Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids,2019 02 19,"The blood-compatible polymer poly(2-methoxyethyl acrylate) (PMEA) is composed of nanometer-scale interfacial structures because of the phase separation of the polymer and water at the PMEA/phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) interface. We synthesized PMEA with four different molecular weights (19, 30, 44, and 183 kg/mol) to investigate the effect of the molecular weight on the interfacial structures and blood compatibility. The amounts of intermediate water and fibrinogen adsorption were not affected by the molecular weight of PMEA. In contrast, the degree of denaturation of adsorbed fibrinogen molecules and platelet adhesion increased as the molecular weight increased. Atomic force microscopy observation revealed that the domain size of the microphase separation structures observed at the PMEA/PBS interfaces drastically (nearly 3 times in the mean area of a domain) changed with the molecular weight. PMEA with a lower molecular weight showed a smaller polymer-rich domain size, as expected on the basis of the microphase separation of polymer-rich and water-rich domains. The small domain size suppressed the aggregation and denaturation of adsorbed fibrinogen molecules because only a few fibrinogen molecules were adsorbed on a domain. Increasing the domain size enhanced the denaturation of adsorbed fibrinogen molecules. Controlling the interfacial structures is crucial for ensuring the blood compatibility of polymer interfaces.",Nanostructural Properties and Twist Periodicity of Cellulose Nanofibrils with Variable Charge Density.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30673281,Biomacromolecules,2019 03 11,"Cellulose nanofibrils (CNFs) are a renewable and facile to produce nanomaterial that recently gained a lot of attention in soft material research. The nanostructural properties of the fibrils largely determine their self-organizing functionalities, and the ability to tune the CNF nanostructure through control of the processing parameters is therefore crucial for developing new applications. In this study, we systematically altered the CNF production parameters (i.e., variation in cellulose source, chemical, and mechanical treatment) to observe their impact on the nanostructural properties of the resulting fibrils. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) allowed detailed topological examination of individual CNFs to elucidate fibril properties such as contour length, kink distribution and the right-handed twist periodicity of individual fibrils. Statistical analysis revealed a large dependency of the fibril properties on the industrial treatment of the cellulose source material. Our results furthermore confirm that the average charge density of the fibrils regulates both contour length and twist periodicity and, thus, has a very strong impact on the final morphology of CNFs. These results provide a route to tune the detailed nanostructure of CNFs with potential impact on the self-organization of these biological colloids and their optimal use in new nanomaterials."

The effect of natural organic matter, abundant in these same environments, on Fe2+(aq)-magnetite interactions is an additional complex that remains poorly understood. We investigated the influence of a model quinone molecule anthraquinone-2,6-disulfonate (AQDS) on Fe2+(aq)-magnetite interactions by systematically studying equilibrium Fe2+(aq) concentrations, rates and extents of AQDS reduction, and structural versus surface-localized Fe(II)/Fe(III) ratios in magnetite under different controlled experimental conditions. The equilibrium concentration of Fe2+(aq) in Fe2+-amended magnetite suspensions with AQDS proportionally changes with solution pH or initial AQDS concentration, but independent of magnetite loadings through the solid concentrations that were studied here. The rates and extents of AQDS reduction by Fe2+-amended magnetite proportionally increased with solution pH, magnetite loading, and initial Fe2+(aq) concentration, which correlates with the corresponding change of reduction potentials for the Fe2+-magnetite system. AQDS reduction by surface-associated Fe(II) in the Fe2+-magnetite suspensions induces solid-state migration of electron equivalents from particle interiors to the near-surface region and the production of nonmagnetic Fe(II)-containing species, which inhibits Fe2+(aq) incorporation or electron injection into the magnetite structure. This study demonstrates the significant influence of quinones on reductive activity of the Fe2+-magnetite system.",Breaking Long-Range Order in Iridium Oxide by Alkali Ion for Efficient Water Oxidation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30673269,Journal of the American Chemical Society,2019 02 20,"Oxygen electrochemistry plays a critical role in clean energy technologies such as fuel cells and electrolyzers, but the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) severely restricts the efficiency of these devices due to its slow kinetics. Here, we show that via incorporation of lithium ion into iridium oxide, the thus obtained amorphous iridium oxide (Li-IrO x) demonstrates outstanding water oxidation activity with an OER current density of 10 mA/cm2 at 270 mV overpotential for 10 h of continuous operation in acidic electrolyte. DFT calculations show that lithium incorporation into iridium oxide is able to lower the activation barrier for OER. X-ray absorption characterizations indicate that both amorphous Li-IrO x and rutile IrO2 own similar [IrO6] octahedron units but have different [IrO6] octahedron connection modes. Oxidation of iridium to higher oxidation states along with shrinkage in the Ir-O bond was observed by in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy on amorphous Li-IrO x, but not on rutile IrO2 under OER operando conditions. The much more ""flexible"" disordered [IrO6] octahedrons with higher oxidation states in amorphous Li-IrO x as compared to the periodically interconnected ""rigid"" [IrO6] octahedrons in crystalline IrO2 are able to act as more electrophilic centers and thus effectively promote the fast turnover of water oxidation.",Controlled Nano-Bio Interface of Functional Nanoprobes for in Vivo Monitoring Enzyme Activity in Tumors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30673268,ACS nano,2019 02 28,"Engineering inorganic nanoparticles with a biocompatible shell to improve their physicochemical properties is a vital step in taking advantage of their superior magnetic, optical, and photothermal properties as multifunctional molecular imaging probes for disease diagnosis and treatment. The grafting/peeling-off strategy we developed for nanoparticle surface coating can fully control the targeting capability of functional nanoprobes by changing their colloidal behaviors such as diffusion and sedimentation rates at the desired sites. We demonstrated that a cleavable coating layer initially immobilized on the surface of magnetic resonance imaging probes not only makes the nanoparticles water-soluble but also can be selectively removed by specific enzymes, thereby resulting in a significant decrease of their water solubility in an enzyme-rich environment. Upon removal of surface coating, the changes in hydrodynamic size and surface charges of nanoprobes as a result of interacting with biomolecules and proteins lead to dramatic changes in their in vivo colloidal behaviors ( i. e., slow diffusion rates, tendency to aggregate and precipitate), which were quantitatively evaluated by examining changes in their hydrodynamic sizes, magnetic properties, and count rates during the size measurement. Because the retention time of nanoprobes within the tumor tissues depends on the uptake and excretion rate of the nanoprobes through the tumors, selective activation of nanoprobes by a specific enzyme resulted in much higher tumor accumulation and longer retention time within the tumors than that of the inactive nanoprobes, which passively passed through the tumors. The imaging contrast effect of tumors using activatable nanoprobes was significantly improved over using inactive probes. Therefore, the grafting/peeling-off strategy, as a general design approach for surface modification of nanoprobes, offers a promising and highly efficient way to render the nanoparticles suitable for targeted imaging of tumors.","Structural Analogue of Thioflavin T, DMASEBT, as a Tool for Amyloid Fibrils Study.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30673267,Analytical chemistry,2019 02 19,"Fluorescent dye trans-2-[4-(dimethylamino)styryl]-3-ethyl-1,3-benzothiazolium perchlorate (DMASEBT) is a relatively recently synthesized probe for detection of amyloid fibrils accumulating in the organs and tissues of patients with a wide range of serious incurable diseases. DMASEBT was developed as an alternative of its widely used analogue thioflavin T (ThT), which is the ""gold standard"" for the amyloid fibrils study. Our results show the similarity of both dyes binding to amyloid fibrils and allow one to propose a mechanism of such probes interaction with some types of the fibrils. At the same time, DMASEBT has a significant advantage, namely, improved photophysical properties compared with ThT, which allows for the detection of DMASEBT-stained amyloid fibrils in the spectral region of the ""transparency window of biological tissues"". The ability of the dye to penetrate into the cells was shown to open the prospect of this dye's use for amyloid fibrils bioimaging and biosensing in vivo. Furthermore, it was proven that DMASEBT can be used not only as a test for amyloid fibrils formation but also for the comparative study of the fibrils structure (both their fibers and bunches), which in turn may underlie the variability of amyloidosis and affect the cytotoxicity of these protein aggregates.",Neutrophil Membrane-Derived Nanovesicles Alleviate Inflammation To Protect Mouse Brain Injury from Ischemic Stroke.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30673266,ACS nano,2019 03 29,"Ischemic stroke is an acute and severe neurological disease, resulting in disability and death. Reperfusion to an ischemic brain is a means to reverse brain damage after stroke; however, this causes secondary tissue damage induced by inflammation responses, called ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. Adhesion of neutrophils to endothelial cells underlies the initiation of inflammation in I/R. Inspired by this interaction, we report a drug delivery system comprised of neutrophil membrane-derived nanovesicles loaded with Resolvin D2 (RvD2) that can enhance resolution of inflammation, thus protecting brain damage during ischemic stroke. In the study, the middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) mouse model was developed to mimic ischemic stroke. Using intravital microscopy of a live mouse brain, we visualized the binding of nanovesicles to inflamed brain vasculature for delivery of therapeutics to ischemic stroke lesions in real-time. We also observed that RvD2-loaded nanovesicles dramatically decreased inflammation in ischemic stroke and improved mouse neurological functions. Our study provides a strategy to inhibit neuroinflammation using neutrophil-derived nanovesicles for ischemic stroke therapy.",Enantioselective Toxicity of Chiral Herbicide Metolachlor to Microcystis aeruginosa.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30673265,Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,2019 02 21,"The enantioselective effects of chiral herbicides on aquatic organisms have received increasing attention. As one kind of freshwater algae responsible for most algal blooms, Microcystis aeruginosa can produce hepatotoxic microcystin and cause serious health concerns for drinking water. Thus, the effects of chiral herbicides on M. aeruginosa are of vital significance but poorly understood, especially as the structures of chiral herbicides become more complex. In this study, the enantioselective effects of four metolachlor enantiomers based on carbon center and axis chirality on M. aeruginosa were investigated for the first time at an enantiomeric level. The results of the investigation into algal growth inhibition, chlorophyll a content, and cell integrity indicated that ( S)-metolachlor [( S)-Met] was significantly more toxic than any other isomer. The toxicity ranking of different enantiomers at the highest concentration (15 mg/L) against M. aeruginosa was ( S)-Met > (α R,1' S)-Met > (α S,1' S)-Met > (α S,1' R)-Met > (α R,1' R)-Met, with (α S,1' S)-Met and (α R,1' S)-Met displaying a synergistic effect. Additionally, the Fe distribution in M. aeruginosa presented distinct enantioselectivity, which may contribute to the enantioselective toxicity of metolachlor. Furthermore, metolachlor upregulated the expression of genes mcyD and mcyH in an enantioselective manner, indicating that this herbicide can potentially promote the synthesis and efflux of microcystin, thus aggravating agricultural water contamination to different extents. Overall, this study will help to understand the ecotoxicity of metolachlor at a deeper level and provide theoretical insights into the enantioselective behaviors of metolachlor.","Different Toxic Effects of Racemate, Enantiomers, and Metabolite of Malathion on HepG2 Cells Using High-Performance Liquid Chromatography-Quadrupole-Time-of-Flight-Based Metabolomics.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30673264,Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,2019 03 04,"Commercial malathion is a racemic mixture that contains two enantiomers, and malathion has adverse effects on mammals. However, whether these two enantiomers have different effects on animals remains unclear. In this study, we tested the effect of racemate, enantiomers, and metabolite of malathion on the metabolomics profile of HepG2 cells. HepG2 cells showed distinct metabolic profiles when treated with rac-malathion, malaoxon, R-(+)-malathion, and S-(-)-malathion, and these differences were attributed to pathways in amino acid metabolism, oxidative stress, and inflammatory response. In addition, malathion treatment caused changes in amino acid levels, antioxidant activity, and expression of inflammatory genes in HepG2 cells. S-(-)-Malathion exhibited stronger metabolic perturbation than its enantiomer and racemate, consistent with the high level of cytotoxicity of S-(-)malathion. R-(+)-Malathion treatment caused significant oxidative stress in HepG2 cells but induced a weaker disturbance in the amino acid metabolism and a pro-inflammatory response compared to S-(-)-malathion and rac-malathion. Malaoxon caused more significant perturbation on antioxidase and a stronger antiapoptosis effect than its parent malathion. Our results provide insight into the risk assessment of malathion enantiomers and metabolites. We also demonstrate that a metabolomics approach can identify the discrepancy of the toxic effects and underlying mechanisms for enantiomers and metabolites of chiral pesticides.",Temperature Dependence of Static Structure Factor Peak Intensities for a Pyrrolidinium-Based Ionic Liquid.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30673263,The journal of physical chemistry. B,2019 02 21,"Static structure factors ( S( q)) for many ionic liquids show low-wavenumber peaks whose intensities increase with increasing temperature. The greater peak intensities might seem to imply increasing intermediate-range order with increasing temperature. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for a representative ionic liquid, 1-butyl-1-methylpyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (C4C1pyrrTFSI), were used to calculate S( q) and partial S( q) (cation-cation, anion-anion, and cation-anion) at 298, 363, and 500 K. S( q) and partial S( q) were further decomposed into positive and negative components (which each indicate structural ordering) by separately summing positive and negative Fourier transform summands. Increasing temperature causes the negative components of each partial S( q) to decrease in magnitude more than the positive components, causing the total S( q) to increase in magnitude. Thus, structural ordering with periodicities corresponding to observed peaks in S( q) does not increase but instead decoheres with increasing temperature, even though S( q) peak heights increase. Fourier transform summands also show where in real space the positive and negative component contributions to S( q) change when the temperature increases. This new, detailed analysis based on Fourier transform summands comprising S( q) argues for great caution when interpreting S( q) intensities and highlights the value of simulations as a complement to X-ray (or neutron) scattering experiments.","Crystalline-Amorphous Permalloy@Iron Oxide Core-Shell Nanoparticles Decorated on Graphene as High-Efficiency, Lightweight, and Hydrophobic Microwave Absorbents.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30673262,ACS applied materials & interfaces,2019 02 26,"The exploration of high-efficiency microwave absorption materials with lightweight and hydrophobic features is highly expected to reduce or eliminate the electromagnetic pollution. Graphene-based nanocomposites are universally acknowledged as promising candidates for absorbing microwaves due to their remarkable dielectric properties and lightweight characteristic. However, the hydrophilicity of graphene may reduce their stability and restrict the applications in moist environment. Herein, a well-designed heterostructure composed of crystalline permalloy core and amorphous iron oxide shell was uniformly adhered on oleylamine-modified graphene nanosheets by a one-pot thermal decomposition method. Compared with the recognized hydrophilic graphene-based hybrid materials, the permalloy@iron oxide/graphene nanocomposites show excellent hydrophobic and water-resistant features with a water contact angle of 136.5°. Besides, the nanocomposites show high-efficiency microwave absorption performance, benefiting from the tunneling effect, polarization, interface interaction, impedance matching condition, and synergistic effect between core-shell permalloy@iron oxide nanoparticles and graphene nanosheets. A broad effective absorption bandwidth with reflection loss (RL) value exceeding -10 dB can be obtained from 4.25 to 18 GHz, covering about 86% measured frequency range when the absorber thickness is 2.0-5.0 mm. Also, the microwave absorption performance of nanocomposites can be tuned by changing the amount of graphene. More importantly, a greatly improved microwave absorption effectiveness of -71.1 dB can be achieved for the nanocomposites in comparison with the bare permalloy@iron oxide nanoparticles (-5.6 dB) and oleylamine-modified GO nanosheets (-3.56 dB). The lightweight and hydrophobic permalloy@iron oxide/graphene nanocomposites with high-efficiency microwave absorption performance are highly promising to improve the environmental adaptability of electric devices, especially in the wet environment.",Insights into Long-Term Toxicity of Triclosan to Freshwater Green Algae in Lake Erie.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30673261,Environmental science & technology,2019 02 19,"This study explored the long-term impacts of a pulse disturbance of triclosan on five nontarget green algae in Lake Erie. Comprehensive analyses were performed using multiple physiological end points at community and subcellular scales. The toxic mechanism of triclosan in a wide range of concentrations was analyzed. The diverse sensitivity of algae species and complex interrelationships among multiple end points were revealed. The results showed the taxonomic groups of algae were the key issue for sensitivity difference. High doses of triclosan caused irreversible damage on algae, and environmentally relevant doses initiated either inhibition or stimulation. Smaller cells had higher sensitivity to triclosan, while larger cells had a wider size variation after exposure. Colonial cells were less sensitive than unicells. For chlorophyll, there were better dose-response relationships in Chlorococcum sp., Chlamydomonas reinhardtii CPCC 12 and 243 than Asterococcus superbus and Eremosphaera viridis. For chlorophyll fluorescence, Fv/ Fm was the most sensitive parameter, and qN was more sensitive than qP. Triclosan showed long-term effects on biochemical components, such as lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids. The findings will be helpful for a systematic and complete assessment of triclosan toxicity in natural waters and the development of appropriate strategies for its risk management."

B,2019 02 22,"We have investigated photoinduced hole hopping in a Pseudomonas aeruginosa azurin mutant Re126WWCuI, where two adjacent tryptophan residues (W124 and W122) are inserted between the CuI center and a Re photosensitizer coordinated to a H126 imidazole (Re = ReI(H126)(CO)3(dmp)+, dmp = 4,7-dimethyl-1,10-phenanthroline). Optical excitation of this mutant in aqueous media (≤40 μM) triggers 70 ns electron transport over 23 Å, yielding a long-lived (120 μs) ReI(H126)(CO)3(dmp•-)WWCuII product. The Re126FWCuI mutant (F124, W122) is not redox-active under these conditions. Upon increasing the concentration to 0.2-2 mM, {Re126WWCuI}2 and {Re126FWCuI}2 are formed with the dmp ligand of the Re photooxidant of one molecule in close contact (3.8 Å) with the W122' indole on the neighboring chain. In addition, {Re126WWCuI}2 contains an interfacial tryptophan quadruplex of four indoles (3.3-3.7 Å apart). In both mutants, dimerization opens an intermolecular W122' → //*Re ET channel (// denotes the protein interface, *Re is the optically excited sensitizer). Excited-state relaxation and ET occur together in two steps (time constants of ∼600 ps and ∼8 ns) that lead to a charge-separated state containing a Re(H126)(CO)3(dmp•-)//(W122•+)' unit; then (CuI)' is oxidized intramolecularly (60-90 ns) by (W122•+)', forming ReI(H126)(CO)3(dmp•-)WWCuI//(CuII)'. The photocycle is closed by ∼1.6 μs ReI(H126)(CO)3(dmp•-) → //(CuII)' back ET that occurs over 12 Å, in contrast to the 23 Å, 120 μs step in Re126WWCuI. Importantly, dimerization makes Re126FWCuI photoreactive and, as in the case of {Re126WWCuI}2, channels the photoproduced ""hole"" to the molecule that was not initially photoexcited, thereby shortening the lifetime of ReI(H126)(CO)3(dmp•-)//CuII. Although two adjacent W124 and W122 indoles dramatically enhance CuI → *Re intramolecular multistep ET, the tryptophan quadruplex in {Re126WWCuI}2 does not accelerate intermolecular electron transport; instead, it acts as a hole storage and crossover unit between inter- and intramolecular ET pathways. Irradiation of {Re126WWCuII}2 or {Re126FWCuII}2 also triggers intermolecular W122' → //*Re ET, and the Re(H126)(CO)3(dmp•-)//(W122•+)' charge-separated state decays to the ground state by ∼50 ns ReI(H126)(CO)3(dmp•-)+ → //(W122•+)' intermolecular charge recombination. Our findings shed light on the factors that control interfacial hole/electron hopping in protein complexes and on the role of aromatic amino acids in accelerating long-range electron transport.",Ultrafast Broadband Fluorescence Up-conversion Study of the Electronic Relaxation of Metalloporphyrins.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30673249,The journal of physical chemistry. A,2019 02 25,"We present a systematic study of the ultrafast fluorescence with broadband detection and ∼110 fs resolution of 5,10,15,20-tetraphenylporphin (TPP) and 2,3,7,8,12,13,17,18-octaethylporphin (OEP), with open 3d-shell metals. We also revisit the cases of the closed-shell ZnTPP and ZnOEP systems. We find that in all cases, the relaxation from the Soret (B)-state to the Q-states (S1) occurs on ultrafast time scales of <50-100 fs, regardless of the metal, its oxidation state, and the peripheral groups of the macrocycle. The analogy with free base TPP and OEP leads us to conclude that the B-Q relaxation involves only the porphyrin states. ZnTPP is an outlier compared to the entire set of investigated systems, in the sense that the B-Q relaxation is significantly slowed down and is multiexponential. We argue that because of a lower density of states in the region of the Soret band, compared to ZnOEP, the relaxation time becomes much longer. Finally, the role of metal orbitals is apparent in the relaxation of the Q-state, which is found to be much faster in the case of open-shell metals compared to closed-shell ones, hinting to an electron transfer from the porphyrin to the metal.",On-Demand Intracellular Delivery of Single Particles in Single Cells by 3D Hollow Nanoelectrodes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30673248,Nano letters,2019 03 19,"Delivery of molecules into intracellular compartments is one of the fundamental requirements in molecular biology. However, the possibility of delivering a precise number of nano-objects with single-particle resolution is still an open challenge. Here we present an electrophoretic platform based on 3D hollow nanoelectrodes to enable delivery of single nanoparticles into single selected cells and monitoring of the single-particle delivery by surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS). The gold-coated hollow nanoelectrode capable of confinement and enhancement of electromagnetic fields upon laser illumination can distinguish the SERS signals of a single nanoparticle flowing through the nanoelectrode. Tight wrapping of cell membranes around the nanoelectrodes allows effective membrane electroporation such that single gold nanorods are delivered on demand into a living cell by electrophoresis. The capability of the 3D hollow nanoelectrodes to porate cells and reveal single emitters from the background in continuous flow is promising for the analysis of both intracellular delivery and sampling.",Imaging Carrier Inhomogeneities in Ambipolar Tellurene Field Effect Transistors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30673247,Nano letters,2019 03 19,"The development of van der Waals (vdW) homojunction devices requires materials with narrow bandgaps and simultaneously high hole and electron mobilities for bipolar transport, as well as methods to image and study spatial variations in carrier type and associated conductivity with nanometer spatial resolution. Here, we demonstrate the general capability of near-field scanning microwave microscopy (SMM) to image and study the local carrier type and associated conductivity in operando by studying ambiploar field-effect transistors (FETs) of the 1D vdW material tellurium in 2D form. To quantitatively understand electronic variations across the device, we produce nanometer-resolved maps of the local carrier equivalence backgate voltage. We show that the global device conductivity minimum determined from transport measurements does not arise from uniform carrier neutrality but rather from the continued coexistence of p-type regions at the device edge and n-type regions in the interior of our micrometer-scale devices. This work both underscores and addresses the need to image and understand spatial variations in the electronic properties of nanoscale devices.",Colloidal Model for the Prediction of the Extraction of Rare Earths Assisted by the Acidic Extractant.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30673246,Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids,2019 05 01,"We propose the statistical thermodynamic model for the prediction of the liquid-liquid extraction efficiency in the case of rare-earth metal cations using the common bis(2-ethyl-hexyl)phosphoric acid (HDEHP) extractant. In this soft matter-based approach, the solutes are modeled as colloids. The leading terms in free-energy representation account for: the complexation, the formation of a highly curved extractant film, lateral interactions between the different extractant head groups in the film, configurational entropy of ions and water molecules, the dimerization, and the acidity of the HDEHP extractant. We provided a full framework for the multicomponent study of extraction systems. By taking into account these different contributions, we are able to establish the relation between the extraction and general complexation at any pH in the system. This further allowed us to rationalize the well-defined optimum in the extraction engineering design. Calculations show that there are multiple extraction regimes even in the case of lanthanide/acid system only. Each of these regimes is controlled by the formation of different species in the solvent phase, ranging from multiple metal cation-filled aggregates (at the low acid concentrations in the aqueous phase), to the pure acid-filled aggregates (at the high acid concentrations in the aqueous phase). These results are contrary to a long-standing opinion that liquid-liquid extraction can be modeled with only a few species. Therefore, a traditional multiple equilibria approach is abandoned in favor of polydisperse spherical aggregate formations, which are in dynamic equilibrium.",Formation of Highly Substituted Indenes through Acid Promoted Cyclodehydration with Nucleophile Incorporation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30673245,The Journal of organic chemistry,2019 03 01,"Readily accessible 3-aryl-2-carboxypropenones (by Knoevenagel condensation) undergo acid promoted cyclodehydration with nucleophile incorporation to form highly substituted indenes. For stronger nucleophiles, nucleophile incorporation precedes cyclodehydration in a nucleophilic-addition-cyclodehydration (NAC) sequence. For weaker nucleophiles, cyclodehydration precedes nucleophile incorporation in a cyclodehydrative-nucleophilic-trapping (CNT) sequence, involving a reactive allyl cation intermediate. The substrate scope and preferred cyclization pathway (NAC or CNT) has been studied with respect to 3-aryl-2-carboxypropenone and the nature of the nucleophile. Also, for 1,3-diaryl-2-carboxypropenones, which can also undergo Nazarov cyclization, delineation between competing Nazarov and CNT pathways is controlled by the nature of the acid catalyst.",Photocatalytic and Photoelectrochemical Degradation of Organic Compounds with All-Inorganic Metal Halide Perovskite Quantum Dots.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30673244,The journal of physical chemistry letters,2019 02 15,"Inspired by the outstanding optoelectronic properties reported for all-inorganic halide perovskite quantum dots (QDs), we have evaluated the potential of these materials toward the photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical degradation of organic compounds, taking the oxidation of 2-mercaptobenzothiazole (MBT) as a proof-of-concept. First, we determined electrochemically the energy levels of dispersions of perovskite QDs with different band gaps induced by the different ratios between halides (Br and I) and metallic cations (Pb and Sn). Then, we selected CsPbBr3 QDs to demonstrate the photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical oxidation of MBT, confirming that hole injection takes place from CsPbBr3 QDs to MBT, resulting in the total degradation of MBT as evidenced by electrospray mass spectrometry analyses. Although the stability and toxicity of these QDs are major issues to address in the near future, the results obtained in the present study open promising perspectives for the implementation of solar-driven catalytic strategies based on these fascinating materials.",Soft X-ray Chlorine Photolysis on Chlorobenzene Ice: An Experimental and Theoretical Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30673243,The journal of physical chemistry. A,2019 02 25,"An experimental and theoretical study of the photoinduced homolysis of the carbon-chlorine bond in an ice matrix of chlorobenzene is presented. A condensed chlorobenzene film has been grown in situ and near edge X-ray fine structure (NEXAFS) spectra were collected after exposing the condensed film to a monochromatic photon beam centered at the 2822 eV resonant excitation of chlorine and at 2850 eV. The photoabsorption to the Cl 1s → σ* and Cl 1s → π* states has been measured and the hypothesis of free radical coupling reactions was investigated via time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) and complete active space self-consistent field (CASSCF) calculations. Also, potential energy pathways to the C-Cl cleavage have been obtained at the CASSCF level to the Cl 1s → σ*, 1s → π*, and 1s → ∞ states. A strong dissociative character was only found for the Cl 1s → σ* resonance.",Unraveling the Metastability of C n2+ ( n = 2-4) Clusters.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30673242,The journal of physical chemistry letters,2019 02 15,"Pure carbon clusters have received considerable attention for a long time. However, fundamental questions, such as what the smallest stable carbon cluster dication is, remain unclear. We investigated the stability and fragmentation behavior of C n2+ ( n = 2-4) dications using state-of-the-art atom probe tomography. These small doubly charged carbon cluster ions were produced by laser-pulsed field evaporation from a tungsten carbide field emitter. Correlation analysis of the fragments detected in coincidence reveals that they only decay to C n-1+ + C+. During C22+ → C+ + C+, significant kinetic energy release (∼5.75-7.8 eV) is evidenced. Through advanced experimental data processing combined with ab initio calculations and simulations, we show that the field-evaporated diatomic 12C22+ dications are either in weakly bound 3Πu and 3Σg- states, quickly dissociating under the intense electric field, or in a deeply bound electronic 5Σu- state with lifetimes >180 ps.",Exploring Through-Space Spin-Spin Couplings for Quantum Information Processing: Facing the Challenge of Coherence Time and Control Quantum States.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30673241,The journal of physical chemistry. A,2019 02 25,"Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is a powerful tool for studying quantum information processing (QIP). Recently quantum technologies have been proposed to overcome the challenges in large-scale NMR QIP. Furthermore, computational chemistry can promote its improvement. Nuclear spins-1/2 are natural qubits and have been used in most NMR quantum computation experiments. However, molecules that enable many qubits NMR QIP implementations should meet some requirements regarding their spectroscopic properties. Exceptionally large through-space (TS) P-P spin-spin coupling constants (SSCC or J) observed in 1,8-diphosphanaphthalenes (PPN) and in naphtho[1,8- cd]-1,2-dithiole phenylphosphines (NTP) were proposed and investigated to provide more accurate control within large-scale NMR QIP. Spectroscopic properties of PPN and NTP derivatives were explored by theoretical strategies using locally dense basis sets (LDBS). 31P chemical shifts (δ) calculated at the B3LYP/aug-cc-pVTZ-J level and TS P-P SSCCs at the PBE1PBE/pcJ-2 (LDBS-1) level are very close to the experimental data for the PPN molecule. Differently, for the NTP dimer, PBE1PBE/pcJ-2 (LDBS-2) predicts more accurate 31P δ, whereas PBE1PBE/Def2-TZVP (LDBS-1) forecasts more accurate TS P-P SSCCs. From our results, PPNo-F, PPNo-ethyl, and PPNo-NH2 were the best candidates for NMR QIP, in which the large TS SSCCS could face the need of long-time quantum gates implementations. Therefore, it could overcome natural limitations concerning the development of large-scale NMR."

In this work, the conductive self-healing nanocomposite hydrogels based on nanoclay (laponite), multiwalled carbon nanotubes (CNTs), and N-isopropyl acrylamide are presented. The presented nanocomposite hydrogels displayed good electrical conductivity, rapid self-healing and adhesive properties, flexible and stretchable mechanical properties, and high sensitivity to near-infrared light and temperature. These excellent properties of the hydrogels are demonstrated by the three-dimensional (3D) bulky pressure-dependent device, human activity monitoring device, and 3D printed gridding scaffolds.

Herein, we show that the alkaline HER/HOR kinetics can be unified by the catalytic roles of the adsorbed hydroxyl (OHad)-water-alkali metal cation (AM+) adducts, on the basis of the observations that enriching the OHad abundance via surface Ni benefits the HER/HOR; increasing the AM+ concentration only promotes the HER, while varying the identity of AM+ affects both HER/HOR. The presence of OHad-(H2O) x-AM+ in the double-layer region facilitates the OHad removal into the bulk, forming OH--(H2O) x-AM+ as per the hard-soft acid-base theory, thereby selectively promoting the HER. It can be detrimental to the HOR as per the bifunctional mechanism, as the AM+ destabilizes the OHad, which is further supported by the CO oxidation results. This new notion may be important for alkaline electrochemistry.",Electron-Driven In Situ Transmission Electron Microscopy of 2D Transition Metal Dichalcogenides and Their 2D Heterostructures.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30673226,ACS nano,2019 02 28,"Investigations on monolayered transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) and TMD heterostructures have been steadily increasing over the past years due to their potential application in a wide variety of fields such as microelectronics, sensors, batteries, solar cells, and supercapacitors, among others. The present work focuses on the characterization of TMDs using transmission electron microscopy, which allows not only static atomic resolution but also investigations into the dynamic behavior of atoms within such materials. Herein, we present a body of recent research from the various techniques available in the transmission electron microscope to structurally and analytically characterize layered TMDs and briefly compare the advantages of TEM with other characterization techniques. Whereas both static and dynamic aspects are presented, special emphasis is given to studies on the electron-driven in situ dynamic aspects of these materials while under investigation in a transmission electron microscope. The collection of the presented results points to a future prospect where electron-driven nanomanipulation may be routinely used not only in the understanding of fundamental properties of TMDs but also in the electron beam engineering of nanocircuits and nanodevices.",FRET-Based Upconversion Nanoprobe Sensitized by Nd3+ for the Ratiometric Detection of Hydrogen Peroxide in Vivo.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30673225,ACS applied materials & interfaces,2019 02 21,"The exorbitant level of hydrogen peroxide is closely related to many human diseases. The development of novel probes for H2O2 detection will be beneficial to disease diagnosis. In this study, a novel Nd3+-sensitized upconversion nanoprobe based on Förster resonance energy transfer was first developed for sensing H2O2. This nanosystem was made of core-shell upconversion nanoparticles (emission at 540 and 660 nm), dicyanomethylene-4 H-pyran (DCM)-H2O2, and poly acrylic acid (PAA)-octylamine. Obviously, upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) doped with Nd3+ acted as an energy donor, and DCM-H2O2, transferring to DCM-OH with the reaction of H2O2, acted as an energy acceptor. The ratiometric upconversion luminescence (540 nm/660 nm) signal could be utilized to visualize the H2O2 level, and the LOD of the nanoprobe for H2O2 was quantified to be 0.168 μM. Meanwhile, owing to the dope of Nd3+, the nanoprobe would not induce the overheating effect in biological samples and could possess deeper tissue penetration depth, compared with the UCNPs excited by 980 nm light during bioimaging. The nanoprobe could also play an important role in detecting the exogenous and endogenous H2O2 in living cells with ratiometric UCL (upconversion luminescence) imaging. Furthermore, our nanoprobe could function in detecting the H2O2 in a tumor-bearing mouse model. Therefore, this novel nanoprobe along with the ratiometric method for responding and bioimaging H2O2 could serve as a new model that promotes the emergence of novel probes for H2O2 detection.","Cu(I)-Catalyzed 6- endo-dig Cyclization of Terminal Alkynes, 2-Bromoaryl Ketones, and Amides toward 1-Naphthylamines: Applications and Photophysical Properties.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30673224,Journal of the American Chemical Society,2019 02 13,"Functional group substituted 1-naphthylamines, especially N-methylated ones, play important roles in numerous chemical and biological processes. However, these compounds' general and step-economic syntheses are highly limited, which seriously restricts efforts to improve the properties and develop new functions for this kind of compound. In this report, we describe the development of an efficient, convenient, and general method for the synthesis of valuable functionalized 1-naphthylamines directly from readily available terminal alkynes, 2-bromoaryl ketones, and amides via Cu(I)-catalyzed benzannulation in a green solvent (i.e., water) under Pd- and ligand-free conditions. A total of 82 functionalized 1-naphthylamines, especially synthetically and biologically useful N-methylated compounds, are synthesized in isolated yields up to 95%. Some unique features of the reaction are as follows: (1) exclusive 6 -endo-dig selectivity, (2) ready incorporation of a broad range of functional groups directly from easily available substrates, and (3) amides that can be used as aminating agents and that are excellent alternatives to toxic and/or odorous amines. Due to facile tuning of functional groups for the reaction, the products possess good electronic donor-acceptor structures and exhibit intriguing photophysical properties, such as tunable and polarity-sensitive fluorescence emission and large Stokes shifts (up to 258 nm). Utilizing the products' unique polarity-sensitive fluorescence response, we successfully applied the 1-naphthylamine derivatives, such as compound 91, to image lipid droplets (LDs) and monitor cellular LDs growth.

Significant shifts from isolated ammonia in the gas-phase are observed, as is the liquid-phase photoelectron angular anisotropy.

These ligands are designed to interact with and stabilize the Aβ central helix (residues 13-26) in an α-helical conformation with increased interaction by combining properties of several first-generation ligands. The new peptide-like ligands aim at extended hydrophobic and polar contacts across the central part of the Aβ, that is, ""clamping"" the target. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the stability of the Aβ central helix in the presence of a set of second-generation ligands were performed and revealed further stabilization of the Aβ α-helical conformation, with larger number of polar and nonpolar contacts between ligand and Aβ, compared to first-generation ligands. The synthesis of selected novel Aβ-targeting ligands was performed in solution via an active ester coupling approach or on solid-phase using an Fmoc chemistry protocol. This included incorporation of aliphatic hydrocarbon moieties, a branched triamino acid with an aliphatic hydrocarbon tail, and an amino acid with a 4'- N, N-dimethylamino-1,8-naphthalimido group in the side chain. The ability of the ligands to reduce Aβ1-42 neurotoxicity was evaluated by gamma oscillation experiments in hippocampal slice preparations.

Modi 6 is an acyclic peptide featuring a pyrrolidone carboxylic acid modification, whereas the remaining five TIs are cyclic. All Modi peptides display similar overall structures and trypsin inhibitory activities. No toxicity was observed for these peptides when tested against cancer and insect cells. All Modi peptides were exceptionally stable over 24 h in human serum, indicating a dual strategy to stabilize the peptides in nature, either head-to-tail cyclization or N-pyrolation, which suggests these peptides might be excellent candidates as scaffolds for epitope stabilization in drug design studies.",Temperature-Driven Precise Control of Biological Droplet's Adhesion on a Slippery Surface.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30673218,ACS applied materials & interfaces,2019 02 21,"Precise control of a biological droplet's adhesive force on a liquid-repellent surface for smart antifouling systems is critical and fundamental to scientific research and industrial applications. Although slippery surfaces with stimuli-responsive wetting behaviors have been reported, challenge still remains in designing responsive biological droplets to achieve controllable adhesion and antifouling property. Here, we developed a thermoresponsive biological droplet adhesion system to precisely control its adhesion on the lubricant-infused slippery surface. Single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) in the biological droplet displays molecular configuration reversible deformation under external thermal stimuli. This property ascribes to the changing amount of exposed hydrophobic moieties of ssDNA, which strongly affects the interfacial hydrophobic interaction with the lubricant. This work may improve the understanding of the principles underlying liquid-lubricant interfacial adhesion, open up opportunities for a new class of antifouling systems, and provide a promising system for controllable manipulation of liquids' motion in biochips and microreactor devices."

Intramolecular rotation was investigated by considering the twisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT) fluorescence of BODIPY-ISO, which increases in intensity with increasing viscosity of the medium. In situ fluorescence spectroscopy was performed on mixed monolayers of BODIPY-ISO with several different lipids at the air-water interface during in-plane compression of the monolayers. Depending on the identity of the lipid used, the fluorescence of the mixed monolayers could be enhanced by mechanical compression, indicating that the rotation of BODIPY-ISO can be controlled dynamically in mixtures with lipids dispersed at the air-water interface. Taken together, our findings provide insight into strategies for controlling the dynamic behavior of molecular machines involving mechanical stimuli at interfaces.",A Serial Biofiltration System for Effective Removal of Low-Concentration Nitrous Oxide in Oxic Gas Streams: Mathematical Modeling of Reactor Performance and Experimental Validation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30673206,Environmental science & technology,2019 02 19,"Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are among the major anthropogenic sources of N2O, a major greenhouse gas and ozone-depleting agent. We recently devised a zero-energy zero-carbon biofiltration system easily applicable to activated sludge-type WWTPs and performed lab-scale proof-of-concept experiments. The major drawback of the system was the diminished performance observed when fully oxic gas streams were treated. Here, a serial biofiltration system was tested as a potential improvement. A laboratory system with three serially positioned biofilters, each receiving a separate feed of artificial wastewater, was fed N2O-containing gas streams of varied flow rates (200-2000 mL·min-1) and O2 concentrations (0-21%). Use of the serial setup substantially improved the reactor performance. Fed fully oxic gas at a flow rate of 1000 mL·min-1, the system removed N2O at an elimination capacity of 0.402 ± 0.009 g N2O·m-3·h-1 (52.5% removal), which was approximately 2.4-fold higher than that achieved with a single biofilter, 0.171 ± 0.024 g N2O·m-3·h-1. These data were used to validate the mathematical model developed to estimate the performance of the N2O biofiltration system. The Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency indices ranged from 0.78 to 0.93, confirming high predictability, and the model provided mechanistic insights into aerobic N2O removal and the performance enhancement achieved with the serial configuration.",A Versatile Strategy for Transparent Stimuli-Responsive Interference Coloration.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30673205,ACS applied materials & interfaces,2019 03 01,"The bioinspired stimuli-responsive structural coloration offers a wide variety of potential applications, ranging from sensing to camouflage to intelligent textiles. Because of its design simplicity, which does not require multilayers of materials with alternative refractive indices or micro- and nanostructures, thin film interference represents a promising solution toward scalable and affordable manufacturing of high-quality responsive structural coloration systems. However, thin films of polymers with appropriate thickness generally do not exhibit visible structural colors if they are directly deposited on transparent substrates such as glass. In this work, a versatile new strategy that enables transparent stimuli-responsive interference coloration (RIC) in the polymer-metal-substrate system is presented. The key concept is to use an ultrathin metal layer as an optical filter instead of high refractive index substrate or highly reflective substrate. Such an optical filter layer allows tuning of the degree of transparency, the constructive interference reflection light, and complementary destructive interference transmission light via changing the metal layer thickness. Real-time, continuous, colorimetric RIC sensors for humidity, organic vapor, and temperature are demonstrated by using different stimuli-responsive polymers. The transparent RIC film on glass shows strong coupling of constructive interference reflected colors and complementary destructive interference transmitted colors on opposite sides of the film. Such transparent RIC film allows for the proof-of-concept demonstration of a self-reporting, humidity-sensing window.",Chemical Diversification Based on Substrate Promiscuity of a Standalone Adenylation Domain in a Reconstituted NRPS System.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30673204,ACS chemical biology,2019 02 15,"A nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) assembly line ( sfa) in Streptomyces thioluteus that directs the formation of the diisonitrile chalkophore SF2768 (1) has been characterized by heterologous expression and directed gene knockouts. Herein, differential metabolic analysis of the heterologous expression strain and the original host led to the isolation of an SF2768 analogue (2, a byproduct of sfa) that possesses N-isovaleryl rather than 3-isocyanobutyryl side chains. The proposed biosynthetic logic of sfa and the structural difference between 1 and 2 suggested substrate promiscuity of the adenylate-forming enzyme SfaB. Further substrate scope investigation of SfaB and a successfully reconstituted NRPS system including a four-enzyme cascade enabled incorporation of diverse carboxylic acid building blocks into peptide scaffolds, and 30 unnatural products were thus generated. This structural diversification strategy based on substrate flexibility of the adenylation domain and in vitro reconstitution can be applied to other adenylation-priming pathways, thus providing a supplementary method for diversity-oriented total synthesis. Additionally, the biocatalytic process of the putative lysine δ-hydroxylase SfaE was validated through the derivatization of two key aldehyde intermediates (2a and 2b), thereby expanding the toolkit of enzymatic C-H bond activation.",Biomass-Derived Poly(ether-amide)s Incorporating Hydroxycinnamates.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30673203,Biomacromolecules,2019 02 11,"Lignin-derived chemicals have great potential as feedstock to produce polymeric materials, due to the low cost and high abundance of lignin biomass. Lignin is one of the few nonpetroleum sources of aromatic carbon, a desirable moiety in high-performance polymers. Herein we describe the synthesis and characterization of a series of 21 poly(ether-amide)s that incorporate hydroxycinnamates derived from lignin. Three different hydroxycinnamates (coumaric acid, ferulic acid, sinapinic acid) were incorporated into dimers, and then copolymerized with a series of seven aliphatic and aromatic diamines via interfacial polymerization. The resultant polymers exhibited poor solubility in standard organic solvents (excluding DMF), but exhibited moderate glass transition temperatures and moderate thermal stabilities. Additionally, the polymers exhibit excellent resistance to hydrolysis.

Here, we illustrate the crucial role of cosolvents and solvation effects in thermodynamic and kinetic control over peptide association into ultrathin Janus nanosheets, elongated nanobelts, and amyloid-like fibrils. We gained further insight into the solvation-directed self-assembly (SDSA) by investigating residue-specific peptide solvation using molecular dynamics modeling. We proposed the preferential solvation of the aromatic and alkyl domains on the peptide backbone and protofibril surface, which results in volume exclusion effects and restricts the peptide association between hydrophobic walls. We explored the SDSA phenomenon in a library of cosolvents (protic and aprotic), where less polar cosolvents were found to exert a stronger influence on the energetic balance at play during peptide propagation. By tailoring cosolvent polarity, we were able to achieve precise control of the peptide nanostructures with 1D/2D shape selection. We also illustrated the complexity of the SDSA system with pathway-dependent peptide aggregation, where two self-assembly states ( i.e., thermodynamic equilibrium state and kinetically trapped state) from different sample preparation methods were obtained.",[The genetic diagnostics of mutations UGT1A1 in practice of modern medicine.],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30673201,Klinicheskaia laboratornaia diagnostika,2019 03 23,"The detection of mutations of the gene of UDF-glucuronyltransferase A1 (UGT1A1) has an important practical value.

However, it is tremendously difficult to control organic polymers in this way on account of the weak magnetic response. The preparation of block copolymers (BCPs) with high magnetostatic energy is reported here, relying on an effective electrostatic coupling between paramagnetic ions and polymer side chains. As a result, the BCPs undergo a magnetically directed self-assembly to form microphase-segregated nanostructures with long-range order. It is emphasized that such a precisely controlled alignment of the BCPs is performed upon a single commercial magnet with low-intensity field (0.35 Tesla). This strategy is profoundly easy-to-handle in contrast to routine electromagnetic methods with high-intensity field (5-10 Tesla). More significantly, the paramagnetic metal component in the BCP samples can be smartly removed, providing a template effect with a preservation of the directed self-assembled nanofeatures for patterning follow-up functionalized species through the original binding site.","Chemical Characterization, Antioxidant Capacity and Antimicrobial Potential of Essential Oil from the Leaves of Baccharis oreophila Malme.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30673172,Chemistry & biodiversity,2019 03 15,"This is the first time that composition, antimicrobial potential and antioxidant ability of essential oil from the leaves of Baccharis oreophila are reported.

Nonetheless, the atomistic knowledge of the nature of the active sites remains elusive. We systematically investigated the structure sensitivity of Au single crystals for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction. Reaction kinetics for the formation of CO are strongly dependent on the surface structure. Under-coordinated sites, such as those present in Au(110) and at the steps of Au(211), show at least 20-fold higher activity than more coordinated configurations (for example, Au(100)).

Although many putative EAEC virulence factors have been identified, their association with pathogenesis remains unclear. As environmental cues can modulate bacterial virulence, we investigated the effect of oxygen and human intestinal epithelium on EAEC virulence gene expression to determine the involvement of respective gene products in intestinal colonisation and pathogenesis. Using in vitro organ culture of human intestinal biopsies, we established the colonic epithelium as the major colonisation site of EAEC strains 042 and 17-2. We subsequently optimised a vertical diffusion chamber system with polarised T84 colon carcinoma cells for EAEC infection and showed that oxygen induced expression of the global regulator AggR, aggregative adherence fimbriae, E. coli common pilus, EAST-1 toxin, and dispersin in EAEC strain 042 but not in 17-2. Furthermore, the presence of T84 epithelia stimulated additional expression of the mucinase Pic and the toxins HlyE and Pet. This induction was dependent on physical host cell contact and did not require AggR. Overall, these findings suggest that EAEC virulence in the human gut is modulated by environmental signals including oxygen and the intestinal epithelium.",Cancer patients' perceptions of factors influencing their decisions on participation in clinical drug trials: A qualitative meta-synthesis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30673153,Journal of clinical nursing,2019 06 14,To examine cancer patients' perceptions of factors that may influence their decisions on participating in phase I-III clinical drug trials.,Calcium negatively regulates secretion from dense granules in Toxoplasma gondii.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30673152,Cellular microbiology,2019 05 16,"Apicomplexan parasites including Toxoplasma gondii and Plasmodium spp. manufacture a complex arsenal of secreted proteins used to interact with and manipulate their host environment. These proteins are organised into three principle exocytotic compartment types according to their functions: micronemes for extracellular attachment and motility, rhoptries for host cell penetration, and dense granules for subsequent manipulation of the host intracellular environment. The order and timing of these events during the parasite's invasion cycle dictates when exocytosis from each compartment occurs. Tight control of compartment secretion is, therefore, an integral part of apicomplexan biology. Control of microneme exocytosis is best understood, where cytosolic intermediate molecular messengers cGMP and Ca2+ act as positive signals. The mechanisms for controlling secretion from rhoptries and dense granules, however, are virtually unknown. Here, we present evidence that dense granule exocytosis is negatively regulated by cytosolic Ca2+ , and we show that this Ca2+ -mediated response is contingent on the function of calcium-dependent protein kinases TgCDPK1 and TgCDPK3. Reciprocal control of micronemes and dense granules provides an elegant solution to the mutually exclusive functions of these exocytotic compartments in parasite invasion cycles and further demonstrates the central role that Ca2+ signalling plays in the invasion biology of apicomplexan parasites.",Highly Thermally Conductive Polyimide Composites via Constructing 3D Networks.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30673150,Macromolecular rapid communications,2019 01 23,"Easy and high efficient methods are in great demand to obtain polyimide (PI) composites with high thermal conductivity in the electronic packaging field.

Methods Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 84 smokers accessing community service organisations from the alcohol and other drugs, homeless, and mental health sectors. Transcripts were coded and thematically analysed. Results Doctors emerged as the most commonly recognised source of cessation support, followed by Quitline, community service organisation staff; and online resources. The main factors contributing to the possible use of these sources of support were identified as awareness, perceived usefulness and anticipated emotional support. Conclusions The results suggest that doctors are an important group to consider when developing cessation interventions for disadvantaged smokers due to their recognised ability to provide practical and emotional support. However, efforts are needed to ensure doctors are aware of the benefits of cessation for these groups.

In contact with the soil they also constitute a site of interactions between the plant and rhizospheric microorganisms. In legumes, initiation of symbiotic interactions with N2 -fixing rhizobia is often triggered at the root hair cell membrane in response to nodulation factors secreted by rhizobia, and involves early signaling events with changes in H+ , Ca2+ , K+ and Cl- fluxes inducing transient depolarization of the cell membrane. Here, we aimed to build a functional repertoire of the major root hair conductances to cations and anions in the sequenced legume model Medicago truncatula. Five root hair conductances were characterized through patch-clamp experiments on enzymatically recovered root hair protoplasts. These conductances displayed varying properties of voltage dependence, kinetics and ion selectivity. They consisted of hyperpolarization- and depolarization-activated conductances for K+ , cations or Cl- . Among these, one weakly outwardly rectifying cationic conductance and one hyperpolarization-activated slowly inactivating anionic conductance were not known as active in root hairs. All five conductances were detected in apical regions of young growing root hairs using membrane spheroplasts obtained by laser-assisted cell-wall microdissection. Combined with recent root hair transcriptomes of M. truncatula, this functional repertoire of conductances is expected to help the identification of candidate genes for reverse genetics studies to investigate the possible role of each conductance in root hair growth and interaction with the biotic and abiotic environment.",Modified Gant-Miwa-Thiersch procedure (mucosal plication with anal encircling) for rectal prolapse.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30673147,Colorectal disease : the official journal of the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland,2019 05 02,"Rectal prolapse (RP) is usually associated with elderly women and is well recognized as having a detrimental effect on quality of life. A number of surgical procedures for RP are available, but morbidity and mortality are substantial. The Gant-Miwa-Thiersch procedure (GMT) has been frequently used for RP in Japan. However, as GMT has a high recurrence rate it is not widely used elsewhere.

Endorectal advancement flap (ERAF) carries the advantages of no sphincter division, no contour defect to the anal canal and no perineal wound. The failure rate of this procedure ranges between 15% and 60%. Although the procedure traditionally described a rhomboid (tongue-shaped) flap, an elliptical (curvilinear) flap was introduced to try to improve the results.

We used a simple simulated head and neck and prostate phantom. An ionization chamber and radiochromic film were used for measurements of absolute dose and relative dose distribution. The measured doses were compared with calculated doses using a treatment planning system. We defined the uncertainty of the measurement point of the ionization chamber due to the effective point of the chamber and mechanical setup error as 2 mm and estimated the dose variation base on a 2 mm error. We prepared a HU-relative stopping power conversion table and fluence correction factor that were specific to the heterogeneous phantom. The fluence correction factor was determined as a function of depth and was obtained from the ratio of the doses in water and in the phantom at the same effective depths. In the simulated prostate plan, composite doses of measurements and calculations agreed within ±1.3% and the maximum local dose differences of each field were 10.0%. Composite doses in the simulated head and neck plan agreed within 4.0% and the maximum local dose difference for each field was 12.0%. The dose difference for each field came within 2% when taking the measurement uncertainty into consideration. In the composite plan, the maximum dose uncertainty was estimated as 4.0% in the simulated prostate plan and 5.8% in the simulated head and neck plan. Film measurements showed good agreement, with more than 92.5% of points passing a gamma value (3%/3 mm). From these results, the heterogeneous phantom should be useful for verification of IMPT by using a phantom-specific HU-relative stopping power conversion, fluence correction factor, and dose error estimation due to the effective point of the chamber."

Although DTG has two substituents on the Ge atom, the substituents have been limited to simple alkyl and aryl groups in previous work. In this work, to further uncover the new functionalities of this useful building unit, various π-conjugated groups were introduced on Ge of DTG. It was expected that the introduction of π-conjugated groups would give rise to efficient energy transfer between the substituents and the DTG core, which are in proximity and linked by a Ge atom. The thus-prepared DTG compounds with fluorene, terthiophene, and pyrene units on Ge possessed well-separated frontier orbitals on the substituents and the DTG core, as proved by the absorption spectra and DFT calculations. The substituted DTG derivatives showed clear emission only from the energy acceptor even though the energy donor was photoexcited. This indicated the highly efficient energy transfer in these compounds. We also prepared more π-extended compound DTGFl2-Ph with phenyl groups on the DTG thiophene rings. DTGFl2-Ph showed strong emission in the visible region with efficient energy transfer properties. These results clearly indicate the potential application of the present DTG system as optical functional materials.",Mycobacterium avium paratuberculosis and Mycobacterium avium complex and related subspecies as causative agents of zoonotic and occupational diseases.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30673126,Journal of cellular physiology,2019 04 23,"Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) and Mycobacterium avium paratuberculosis (MAP) cause zoonotic infections transmitted by birds and livestock herds. These pathogens have remained as serious economic and health threats in most areas of the world. As zoonotic diseases, the risk of development of occupational disease and even death outcome necessitate implementation of control strategies to prevent its spread. Zoonotic MAP infections include Crohn's disease, inflammatory bowel disease, ulcerative colitis, sarcoidosis, diabetes mellitus, and immune-related diseases (such as Hashimoto's thyroiditis). Paratuberculosis has classified as type B epidemic zoonotic disease according to world health organization which is transmitted to human through consumption of dairy and meat products. In addition, MAC causes pulmonary manifestations and lymphadenitis in normal hosts and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) progression (by serotypes 1, 4, and 8). Furthermore, other subspecies have caused respiratory abscesses, neck lymph nodes, and disseminated osteomyelitis in children and ulcers. However, the data over the occupational relatedness of these subspecies is rare. These agents can cause occupational infections in susceptible herd breeders. Several molecular methods have been recognized as proper strategies for tracking the infection. In this study, some zoonotic aspects, worldwide prevalence and control strategies regarding infections due to MAP and MAC and related subspecies has been reviewed.",Motor units as tools to evaluate profile of human Renshaw inhibition.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30673125,The Journal of physiology,2019 04 23,"To uncover the synaptic profile of Renshaw inhibition on motoneurons, we stimulated thick motor axons and recorded from voluntarily-activated motor units. Stimuli generated a direct motor response on the whole muscle and an inhibitory response in active motor units. We have estimated the profile of Renshaw inhibition indirectly using the response of motor unit discharge rates to the stimulus. We have put forward a method of extrapolation that may be used to determine genuine synaptic potentials as they develop on motoneurons. These optimized techniques can be used in research and in clinics to fully appreciate Renshaw cell function in various neurological disorders.",Interindividual and Regional Variability in Drug Transporter Abundance at the Human Blood-Brain Barrier Measured by Quantitative Targeted Proteomics.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30673124,Clinical pharmacology and therapeutics,2019 03 18,"For in vitro to in vivo extrapolation (IVIVE) of brain distribution of drugs that are transported at the human blood-brain barrier (BBB), it is important to quantify the interindividual and regional variability of drug transporter abundance at this barrier. Therefore, using quantitative targeted proteomics, we compared the abundance of adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette and solute carrier transporters in brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs) isolated from postmortem specimens of two matched brain regions, the occipital (Brodmann Area (BA)17) and parietal (BA39) lobe, from 30 adults. Of the quantifiable transporters, the abundance ranked: glucose transporter (GLUT)1 > breast cancer resistance protein > P-glycoprotein (P-gp) > equilibrative nucleoside transporter (ENT)1 > organic anion-transporting polypeptide (OATP)2B1. The abundance of multidrug resistance protein 1/2/3/4, OATP1A2, organic anion transporter (OAT)3, organic cation transporter (OCT)1/2, OCTN1/2, or ENT2 was below the limit of quantification. Transporter abundance per gram of tissue (scaled using GLUT1 abundance in BMEC vs. brain homogenate) in BA17 was 30-42% higher than BA39. The interindividual variability in transporter abundance (percentage of coefficient of variation (%CV)) was 35-57% (BA17) and 27-46% (BA39).

It is now understood that XoxF enzymes can functionally replace the alternative, calcium-dependent, MxaFI-type methanol dehydrogenases, when Ln3+ are available. These rare-earth metals are not only essential for XoxF activity, but they also regulate gene expression, in a reverse fashion, activating the expression of XoxF and repressing the expression of MxaFI. This type of regulation has created multiple conundrums, including the details of the solubility, transport, sensing and selection mechanisms for Ln3+ by the bacterial cells, as well as the questions relevant to the evolution of the alternative enzymes and their potentially different redox properties. Overall, the newly discovered biological activity of Ln3+ presents a big puzzle. Ochsner et al. add several pieces to this puzzle, utilizing a model phyllosphere colonizer Methylobacterium extorquens PA1. They determine that Ln3+ sensing by this organism can take place via both XoxF-dependent and XoxF-independent mechanisms. They also identify genes for a TonB-dependent transporter and an ABC-type transporter and demonstrate that both are essential for Ln3+ -dependent methanol metabolism. The puzzle still requires multiple additional pieces for completion, but great strides have been made toward the goal of solving it.",Neutralization of IL-17 rescues amyloid-β-induced neuroinflammation and memory impairment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30673121,British journal of pharmacology,2019 03 04,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common neurodegenerative disease characterized by a neuroinflammatory state, and to date, there is no cure and its treatment represents a large unmet clinical need.

Liquid biopsy is a novel noninvasive, real-time and tumour-specific technique, reliably reflecting the comprehensive tumour genetic profile, and thus holds great promise for the genetic assessment, response monitoring and relapse detection of lymphomas. Standard methods for disease response assessment in patients with lymphoma, including positron emission tomography, are imperfect. In other haematological malignancies, particularly leukaemias, the ability to detect minimal residual disease (MRD) is increasingly influencing treatment paradigms. However, in some subtypes of lymphoma, such as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and classic Hodgkin&rsquo;s lymphoma, the application of MRD assessment techniques such as flow cytometry or polymerase chain reaction-based methods has been challenged by the absence of circulating disease. The review summarises the applications of liquid biopsy in the assessment of tumour burden and response to therapy, noninvasive genomic profiling, and monitoring of clonal dynamics in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and classic Hodgkin&rsquo;s lymphoma."

Previous studies confirmed that residual strains in the annulus fibrosus (AF) of the IVD, which result from non-uniform extracellular matrix deposition in response to in-vivo loads, vary by anatomical region (anterior, posterior, and lateral) and zone (inner, middle, and outer). We hypothesized that as the AF is composed of a nonlinear, anisotropic, viscoelastic material, the state of residual strain in the transverse plane would influence the apparent values of axial compressive properties. To test this hypothesis, axial creep indentation tests were performed, using a 1.6mm spherical probe, at nine different anatomical locations on bovine caudal AFs in both the intact (residual strain present) and strain relieved states. The results showed a shift towards increased spatial homogeneity in all measured parameters, particularly instantaneous strain. This shift was not observed in control AFs, which were tested twice in the intact state. Our results confirm that time-dependent axial compressive properties of the AF are sensitive to the state of residual strain in the transverse plane, to a degree that is likely to affect whole disc behavior."

Since then, there have been significant advances in the understanding of the pathophysiology, manifestation and clinical progression, and prognosis of the pathology. The identification of genetic mutations impairing cardiac desmosomes led to the inclusion of this entity in the classification of cardiomyopathies. Classically, ARVC/D is an inherited disease characterized by ventricular arrhythmias, right and / or left ventricular dysfunction; and fibro-fatty substitution of cardiomyocytes; its identification can often be challenging, due to heterogeneous clinical presentation, highly variable intra- and inter-family expressiveness, and incomplete penetrance. In the absence of a gold standard that allows the diagnosis of ARVC/D, several diagnostic categories were combined and recently reviewed for a higher diagnostic sensitivity, without compromising the specificity. The finding that electrical abnormalities, particularly ventricular arrhythmias, usually precede structural abnormalities is extremely important for risk stratification in positive genetic members. Among the complementary exams, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) allows the early diagnosis of left ventricular impairment, even before morpho-functional abnormalities. Risk stratification remains a major clinical challenge, and antiarrhythmic drugs, catheter ablation and implantable cardioverter defibrillator are the currently available therapeutic tools. The disqualification of the sport prevents cases of sudden death because the effort can trigger not only the electrical instability, but also the onset and progression of the disease.",Diuretics are Similar to Losartan on Echocardiographic Target-Organ Damage in Stage I Hypertension. PREVER-Treatment Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30673020,Arquivos brasileiros de cardiologia,2019 01 25,"Blood pressure (BP)-lowering therapy improves left ventricular (LV) parameters of hypertensive target-organ damage in stage II hypertension, but whether there is a drug-class difference in echocardiographic parameters in stage I hypertension patients is less often studied.

As in the general study, systolic BP reduction was similar with diuretics or with losartan. Echocardiographic parameters showed small but significant changes in both treatment groups, with a favorable LV remodeling with antihypertensive treatment for 18 months when target blood pressure was achieved either with chlorthalidone/amiloride or with losartan as the initial treatment strategy.

Using large-scale simulations, we show that hydrodynamic interactions, together with a gravity-like aligning field, lead to tunable self-assembly of active colloidal spheres near a surface. The observed structures depend on the hydrodynamic characteristics: particles driven at the front, pullers, form small chiral spinners consisting of two or three particles, whereas those driven at the rear, pushers, assemble into large dynamic aggregates. The rotational motion of the puller spinners, arises from spontaneous breaking of the internal chirality. Our results show that the fluid flow mediates chiral transfer between neighbouring spinners. Finally we show that the chirality of the individual spinners controls the topology of the self-assembly in solution: homochiral samples assemble into a hexagonally symmetric 2D crystal lattice while racemic mixtures show reduced hexatic order with diffusion-like dynamics.",Tailoring relaxation dynamics and mechanical memory of crumpled materials by friction and ductility.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30672957,Soft matter,2019 02 15,"Crumpled sheets show slow mechanical relaxation and long lasting memory of previous mechanical states.

In order to achieve a seamless transition in dynamic properties we endow the MD simulation with a DPD thermostat, which is validated against experimental results by modeling water at different temperatures. We then validate the MD-DPD coupling method for transient Couette and Poiseuille flows, demonstrating that the concurrent MD-DPD coupling can resolve accurately the continuum-based analytical solutions. Subsequently, we simulate shear flows over grafted polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) surfaces (polymer brushes) for various grafting densities, and investigate the slip flow as a function of the shear stress. We verify that a ""universal"" power law exists for the slip length, in agreement with published results. Having validated the MD-DPD coupling method, we simulate time-dependent flows past an endothelial glycocalyx layer (EGL) in a microchannel. Coupled simulation results elucidate the dynamics of the EGL changing from an equilibrium state to a compressed state under shear by aligning the molecular structures along the shear direction. MD-DPD simulation results agree well with results of a single MD simulation, but with the former more than two orders of magnitude faster than the latter for system sizes above one micron.","Ultrasensitive, flexible, and low-cost nanoporous piezoresistive composites for tactile pressure sensing.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30672952,Nanoscale,2019 03 04,"Highly sensitive flexible tactile sensors are of continuing interest for various applications including wearable devices, human-machine interface systems, and internet of things. Current technologies for high sensitivity piezoresistive sensors rely on costly materials and/or fabrication methods such as graphene-based and micro-structured composites limiting accessibility and scalability. Here, we report a facile sacrificial casting-etching method to synthesize nanoporous carbon nanotube/polymer composites for ultra-sensitive and low-cost piezoresistive pressure sensors. Our synthesis method overcomes the limitations of the traditional solution-dip-coating method for adhering nanoscale conductive materials to the nanoscale porous surface. Importantly, we show ultra-high sensitivity with a strain gauge factor over 300, which is ∼50 times higher than that of traditional CNT-based piezoresistive sensors and ∼10 times higher than that of most of the graphene-based ones. For practical tactile sensing applications, we demonstrate that the sensors can detect both gentle pressures (1 Pa-1 kPa) and low pressures (1 kPa-25 kPa) with a fraction of the cost.

However, the undesired P2-O2 phase transition at high voltages above 4.0 V leads to a large volume change and further causes the rapid decay of capacity. Herein, an electrochemical-active Co3+ substitution is introduced to suppress the P2-O2 phase transformation but not at the cost of capacity. The spherical, Co3+ substituted P2-Na2/3[Ni0.3Co0.1Mn0.6]O2 with a high tap-density of 1.86 g cm-3 is successfully synthesized by co-precipitation and solid-state reactions. As anticipated, it delivers a large specific capacity of 161.6 mA h g-1 with a high median-voltage of 3.64 V (vs. Na/Na+), translated into a high energy-density of ∼590 W h kg-1, which is comparable to that of the commercialized LiCoO2 cathode in lithium-ion batteries. Apart from improved cycling stability ascribed to the mitigated P2-O2 transition, this cathode also shows a better rate property compared with those modified by Li+, Mg2+, Zn2+, Cu2+, and Ti4+ doping and Al2O3 coating. Besides, the P2-Na2/3[Ni0.3Co0.1Mn0.6]O2|hard carbon full-cells deliver a reversible capacity of 150.6 mA h g-1 and have enhanced cycle-life and high-rate capability.

The complexes were characterized by NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and X-ray crystallography. Their electrochemical properties, ligand substitution mechanisms, and ligand exchange rates in aqueous buffer were investigated. These physical properties were correlated to the cellular uptake and anticancer activities of the complexes. The complexes undergo sequential, dissociative ligand substitution, with the exchange rates depending heavily on the axial ligands. Eyring analyses revealed that the relative ligand exchange rates were largely impacted by differences in the entropy, rather than enthalpy, of activation for the complexes. Performing the substitution reactions in the presence of ascorbate led to a change in the reaction profile and kinetics, but no change in the final product. The cytotoxic activity of the complexes correlates with both the ligand exchange rate and reduction potential, with the more easily reduced and rapidly substituted complexes showing higher toxicity.

Herein, we highlight the versatility of applicable sugar types and the controllable hydrogel properties. The mechanical properties and microstructures of the resultant hydrogels can be well controlled by varying the concentration and the reducing power of sugars. Moreover, reducing sugar-independent cytocompatibility of the hydrogels was confirmed by the growth of cells on them. The wide selection of sugar types provides a better understanding of the reaction mechanism and enables the characterization of hydrogels with well-controlled properties."

However, Raman spectra contain molecular information from multiple components and interferences from noise and instrumentation. Thus, component identification using Raman spectra is still challenging, especially for mixtures. In this study, a novel approach entitled deep learning-based component identification (DeepCID) was proposed to solve this problem. Convolution neural network (CNN) models were established to predict the presence of components in mixtures. Comparative studies showed that DeepCID could learn spectral features and identify components in both simulated and real Raman spectral datasets of mixtures with higher accuracy and significantly lower false positive rates. In addition, DeepCID showed better sensitivity when compared with the logistic regression (LR) with L1-regularization, k-nearest neighbor (kNN), random forest (RF) and back propagation artificial neural network (BP-ANN) models for ternary mixture spectral datasets.

By single-crystal XRD, FA based IMCs have been found to possess a perfect cubic structure showing a slight lattice contraction compared to pristine FAPbI3 crystals. In conjunction with optical and electrical analyses, the essential role of the introduced MA and Br ions in stabilizing the black phase in FA-based IMCs has been clarified, which explains the observed enhancement of photoluminescence and reduced trap densities. We also achieve stable pure FAPbI3 crystals that do not exhibit a yellow-phase transition after one month in air. By utilizing (FAPbI3)1-x(MAPbBr3)x IMCs as the photo-absorber, we realize highly photo-responsive photodiodes with a satisfactory stability in air and thermal stability upon heating. Of interest, the best photoresponsivity exceeding 300 A W-1 is achieved upon appropriate air-exposure, which is among the highest values reported for FA-based perovskite photodetectors.

Different families show different and, in many cases, understandable propensities for dissociating from an excited electronic state or following non-adiabatic coupling (i.e. internal conversion) to high vibrational levels of the ground electronic state. The Perspective seeks to emphasise the potentially vast range of behaviours (dissociation timescales, product energy disposals, etc.) that can be expected to accompany internal conversion, reflecting the extent to which the tuning coordinate (i.e. the nuclear motions that tune the energy separation between the excited and ground state) projects onto the dissociation coordinate of interest (i.e. the breaking of the C-H bond).",A critical comparison of neural network potentials for molecular reaction dynamics with exact permutation symmetry.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30672927,Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP,2019 05 16,"The availability of accurate full-dimensional potential energy surfaces (PESs) is a mandatory condition for efficient computer simulations of molecular systems. Much effort has been devoted to developing reliable PESs with physically sound properties, such as the invariance of the energy with respect to the permutation of chemically identical atoms. In this work, we compare the performance of four neural network (NN)-based approaches with a rigorous permutation symmetry for fitting five typical reaction systems: OH + CO, H + H2S, H + NH3, H + CH4 and OH + CH4. The methods can be grouped into two categories, invariant polynomial based NNs and high-dimensional NN potentials (HD-NNPs). For the invariant polynomial based NNs, three types of polynomials, permutation invariant polynomials (PIPs), non-redundant PIPs (NRPIPs) and fundamental invariants (FIs), are used in the input layer of the NN. In HD-NNPs, the total energy is the sum of atomic contributions, each of which is given by an individual atomic NN with input vectors consisting of sets of atom-centered symmetry functions. Our results show that all methods exhibit a similar level of accuracy for the energies with respect to ab initio data obtained at the explicitly correlated coupled cluster level of theory (CCSD(T)-F12a). The HD-NNP method allows study of systems with larger numbers of atoms, making it more generally applicable than invariant polynomial based approaches, which in turn are computationally more efficient for smaller systems. To illustrate the applicability of the obtained potentials, quasi-classical trajectory calculations have been performed for the OH + CH4 → H2O + CH3 reaction to reveal its complicated mode specificity.","Novel design of hollow g-C3N4 nanofibers decorated with MoS2 and S, N-doped graphene for ternary heterostructures.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30672926,"Dalton transactions (Cambridge, England : 2003)",2019 02 15,"Herein, we newly design a ternary structure of 1-dimensional hollow g-C3N4 nanofibers (HGCNF) decorated with molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) and sulfur/nitrogen-doped graphene (SNG) via a one-pot hydrothermal treatment at relatively low temperature.

We observed the morphological structures, chemical composition and optical absorbance of this ternary HGCNF/SNG/MoS2 structure. Of the as-prepared catalysts, HGCNF/SNG/MoS2 exhibited a good possibility to produce hydrogen as an electrocatalyst. Furthermore, we evaluated its stability performance using chronoamperometry for 48 hours, as well as by 3000 cycles of cyclic voltammetry. From the double-layer capacitance measurement, HGCNF/SNG/MoS2 proved itself as an electrocatalyst due to the higher value of electrocatalytically active sites to be 6.97 × 10-3 F cm-2 than that of only HGCNF (0.18 × 10-5 F cm-2) and the binary structure of HGCNF/MoS2 (2.54 × 10-3 F cm-2). We believe that our novel 1-dimensional ternary HGCNF/SNG/MoS2 structure has expedited the electron pathways by reducing the resistance at interfaces among HGCNF, SNG and MoS2, to be potentially useful for the hydrogen evolution reaction.",Engineering biocompatible benzodithiophene-based polymer dots with tunable absorptions as high-efficiency theranostic agents for multiscale photoacoustic imaging-guided photothermal therapy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30672925,Biomaterials science,2019 03 26,"To date, photoacoustic imaging (PAI) and PAI-guided photothermal therapy (PTT) have been performed for noninvasive cancer diagnosis and precise ablation of tumors. To conduct concurrent PAI and PTT, it is essential to develop theranostic agents with strong optical absorption and high photothermal transfer efficiency. In this study, we have engineered theranostic agents with tunable absorptions based on conjugated polymer dots (Pdots) with different structures via the simple precipitation method. The as-synthesized Pdots exhibit strong absorption, high biocompatibility, and superior stability. In addition, the Pdots demonstrate that they can serve as contrast agents for multiscale PAI in vitro and in vivo. More importantly, a high photothermal conversion efficiency up to 40% is reached under irradiation with LED light, resulting in effective cancer treatment with extremely low light dose. Consequently, they show the potential as imaging-guided therapeutic agents for clinical cancer treatment and various biomedical applications.",Interfacial polarizations induced by incorporating traditional perovskites into reduced graphene oxide (RGO) for strong microwave response.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30672924,"Dalton transactions (Cambridge, England : 2003)",2019 02 15,"Incorporation of traditional perovskites into reduced graphene oxide (RGO) is an effective strategy to develop useful microwave absorbents. Taking advantage of the suitable impedance of La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 (LSMO), a novel and available microwave absorber was obtained. Here, we showed an outstanding and stable RGO material decorated with LSMO that can be used as an active component of microwave absorption devices. The as-prepared LSMO/RGO composites adopted the merits of RGO and LSMO and provided good properties, such as a controllable dissipation ability, optimized impedance matching, and broadened effective frequency bandwidth. For example, the minimum reflection loss (RL) value of LSMO/RGO composites with a 60% loading filler ratio reached -38.81 dB with a matching thickness of only 1.7 mm. Furthermore, the effective frequency bandwidth can be as wide as 5.64 GHz, with a thickness of 1.95 mm. Therefore, this work initiates a brand new avenue for artificial research of new materials for electromagnetic wave absorption.",Enhanced oral absorption of insulin using colon-specific nanoparticles co-modified with amphiphilic chitosan derivatives and cell-penetrating peptides.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30672923,Biomaterials science,2019 03 26,"In this study, amphipathic chitosan derivative (ACS) and cell-penetrating peptide (CPP) co-modified colon-specific nanoparticles (CS-CPP NPs) were prepared and evaluated to improve the oral bioavailability of protein and peptide drugs. ACS modification was harnessed to protect CPPs from degradation in the stomach and small intestine after oral administration and achieve colon-specific drug delivery. After CS-CPP NPs reached the colon, ACSs on the surface of the NPs were gradually degraded and CPPs were exposed to bring into play the penetration efficacy in the colon epithelium. Herein, we synthesized four types of ACSs (TOCS, TDCS, TPCS and TSCS) and adopted three types of CPPs (Tat, Penetratin and R8) to prepare NPs (TOCS-Tat NPs, TDCS-Tat NPs, TPCS-Tat NPs, TSCS-Tat NPs, TDCS-Pen NPs and TDCS-R8 NPs). The study of the protective effects of ACS upon Tat showed that the modification of ACS exerted favourable protection upon Tat in the stomach and small intestine. ACS degradation in the colon was indirectly determined in the viscosity method, which indicated that ACS could be gradually degraded in the colon. Using Caco-2 cell monolayers as cell models, it was found that the cellular uptake amount and transcellular transportation performance of CS-CPP NPs were much enhanced compared with those of TDCS NPs and PVA NPs. With Bama mini-pigs as animal models, the pharmacodynamic study demonstrated that the hypoglycemic effect for insulin-loaded TDCS-Tat NPs was more significant than that for TDCS NPs, lowering the blood glucose by 40%. The pharmacokinetic study indicated that the AUC and Cmax for TDCS-Tat NPs were respectively increased by 1.45 times and 1.82 times compared with those of TDCS NPs. In conclusion, CS-CPP NPs as vehicles for colon-specific drug delivery systems may be an efficient approach to improve the oral absorption of protein and peptide drugs."

Here we report a series of 15 patients with CLD who developed pathologic fractures in the setting of metabolic bone disease. During initial evaluation, the caretakers of 5 of these 15 patients were reported to child protective services and investigated for child abuse.

Traumatic injury, such as burn, elicits a number of changes in the gut, including a shift in the composition of the microbiome (dysbiosis), increased gut leakiness, and bacterial translocation into the lymphatic system and bloodstream. These effects are believed to contribute to devastating secondary complications following burn, including pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, multi-organ failure, and septic shock. Clinical studies demonstrate that advanced age causes a significant increase in mortality following burn, but the role of the gut in this age-dependent susceptibility has not been investigated. In this study, we combined our well-established murine model of scald burn injury with bacterial 16S-rRNA gene sequencing to investigate how burn injury affects the fecal microbiome in aged versus young mice. Of our treatment groups, the most substantial shift in gut microbial populations was observed in aged mice that underwent burn injury. We then profiled anti-microbial peptides (AMPs) in the ileum and found that burn injury stimulated a 20-fold rise in levels of regenerating islet-derived protein 3 gamma (Reg3γ), a 16-fold rise in regenerating islet-derived protein 3 beta (Reg3β), and an 8-fold rise in Cathelicidin-related antimicrobial peptide (Cramp) in young, but not aged mice. Advanced age alone elicited 5-fold higher levels of alpha defensin related sequence1 (Defa-rs1) in the ileum, but this increase was lost following burn. Comparison of bacterial genera abundance and AMP expression across treatment groups revealed distinct correlation patterns between AMPs and individual genera. Our results reveal that burn injury drives microbiome dysbiosis and altered AMP expression in an age-dependent fashion, and highlight potential mechanistic targets contributing to the increased morbidity and mortality observed in elderly burn patients.",Sexual Identity Disorder and Psychosis in Klinefelter Syndrome: A Synthesis of Literature and a Case Report.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30672880,The Journal of nervous and mental disease,2019 01 28,"Klinefelter syndrome (KS) 47, XXY is the most frequent chromosomal abnormality causing hypogonadism in humans. This chromosomal abnormality of number in its classical form called homogeneous (supernumerary X) is generally the result of a meiosis accident. Several studies have suggested that individuals with KS are at greater risk of developing various psychiatric disorders, including depression and schizophrenia. The diagnosis is made based on subnormal testosterone with high pituitary gonadotropins and confirmed by determining the karyotype on a blood simple. We did a literature review using an electronic search in three databases: Pubmed/MEDLINE, Google Scholar, and PsychInfo. We found that since 1989, seven case reports with KS and mental disorders with similar and different characteristics of our case illustration of a patient with KS and psychosis were published.","Temporal Self, Psychopathology, and Adaptive Functioning Deficits: An Examination of Acute Psychiatric Patients.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30672879,The Journal of nervous and mental disease,2019 01 28,"Individuals with psychiatric illness have difficulty remembering specific events from their personal past and imagining their future. We examined psychotic psychiatric inpatients' sense of self-continuity over time, predicting that low levels of temporal continuity would predict increased psychopathology and lower functionality. Inpatients (n = 60) were compared with healthy controls (n = 60) on a validated measure of self-continuity, psychiatric symptoms, insight, and adaptive functioning capacity. Results revealed that patients had significant difficulty perceiving their past, present, and future selves as unified over time compared with controls. Within the inpatient group, deficits in present to future self-continuity was associated with patients' severity of positive, negative, and mood symptoms, degree of insight, and adaptive capacity. It may be the case that temporal self-unity provides a context for deriving reinforcement from daily life experiences in the moment and in anticipating the future as well as a worthwhile goal for treatment exploration.",Clinicians' Empathy and Professional Quality of Life.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30672878,The Journal of nervous and mental disease,2019 01 28,"Psychotherapists can experience emotional drain as a result of their work with distressed and traumatized patients.

The current study aimed to explore the relationship of empathy to compassion satisfaction, burnout, and secondary traumatic stress, while also considering the influence of important work conditions. To do so, 240 psychotherapists described their current practice and reported their levels of empathy and their professional quality of life. Results revealed various relationships between dimensions of empathy and professional quality of life, and the moderating role of empathy regarding the impact of work conditions on professional quality of life.

Using data of suicide attempters visiting emergency departments, we investigated whether the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) subscales, by retrospectively evaluating ideation before an attempt, could predict the occurrence of PSA versus unplanned suicide attempts using logistic regression analyses. The severity subscale was used as a continuous (model A) and a categorical (model B) variable. In model A, higher scores on each subscale were associated with increased risk of PSA. In model B, the highest score on the severity subscale and a higher intensity subscale score predicted PSA. The severity and intensity subscales had areas under receiver operating curves of 0.712 and 0.688 with optimum cutoff points of 4/5 and 15/16, respectively. In addition, being aged 30 to 49 and 50 to 69 years, being male, interpersonal stress, and depressive and adjustment disorders increased PSA risk.

The results indicated that early parenting style was not directly related to narcissism, but along with narcissism added to the prediction of attachment style. In combination with vulnerable narcissism, authoritarian parenting was positively related to secure attachment, and negatively related to preoccupied attachment, whereas permissive and responsive parenting were negatively related to secure attachment and positively related to preoccupied attachment.",Health-Related Quality of Life in Patients With Narcolepsy: A Review of the Literature.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30672873,The Journal of nervous and mental disease,2019 01 28,"Narcolepsy is a chronic disorder characterized by symptoms of excessive daytime sleepiness, irresistible sleep attacks that may be accompanied by cataplexy brought on by emotions, sleep paralysis, and hypnagogic hallucinations. This is a review of 32 empirical articles on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) published in peer-reviewed journals over the past 37 years. Deleterious implications on education, recreation, driving, sexual life, and personality are associated with the disease with a consequent negative psychosocial impact. Sleepiness has an important influence on HRQoL, more than the other symptoms of this disorder that have disrupting roles, too. Therefore, patients with narcolepsy need assistance not only for medication prescription but also in terms of psychological and social support. It is also of importance to assess patients with narcolepsy carefully in terms of depressive symptoms because they may have a major impact on HRQoL with important clinical implications.",Cognitive Deficits in Euthymic Patients With Bipolar Disorder: State or Trait Marker?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30672872,The Journal of nervous and mental disease,2019 01 28,"Cognitive deficits have been demonstrated in people in the euthymic phase of bipolar disorder. This cross-sectional study compared euthymic bipolar disorder patients (n = 30) with never psychiatrically ill controls (n = 30) on a neuropsychological test battery containing tasks of executive function, the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST), attention and working memory, digits forward and backward, and speed of information processing digit symbol. Scores on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and vocabulary test did not differ between the groups. The bipolar group was significantly impaired compared with controls on various indices of executive function on the WCST and on the digit tests. The impaired performance on the digit tests, but not the WCST, was significantly associated with medication status, notably prescribed benzodiazepines. There was no significant effect of severity or course of illness on performance. The findings support the hypothesis that impairments in executive function are present between illness episodes in bipolar disorder, and so they are not simply state markers."

Content analysis categorized and contextualized provider narratives. Perceived facilitators of CHTC were provider experiences with couple-centered HIV-related care, existing patient or client demands for joint HIV screening, and a health care practice environment that fosters an interprofessional approach to addressing client needs. Perceived barriers were partner unwillingness to undergo HIV screening, provider role beliefs and preferences regarding couple-based approaches, and provider time constraints in tandem with funding and billing issues. Overall, providers endorsed CHTC and thought that current challenges and successes with couple-based efforts and HIV screening and care could influence CHTC implementation.

Sine oculis homeobox homolog (SIX3) is a human transcription factor that regulates the progression of vertebrate eye and fetal forebrain. However, studies on the function of SIX3 in human tumorigenesis remain rare. In this study, we aim to evaluate the role and the significance of SIX3 in EC. The TCGA database and clinical samples were used to assess the expression of SIX3 in EC patients. The Kaplan-Meier method and Cox's proportional hazards model were performed to analyze the correlations between SIX3 expression and EC clinical outcomes. The expressions of SIX3 in EC cells were measured by quantitative reverse transcription PCR analysis. The cell proliferation was detected using cell counting kit-8 and colony formation assay. The migration and invasion capacity of EC cells were evaluated using wound healing and Transwell methods. Western blot assay was used to measure the alterations in some important protein expression levels in the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. We found that SIX3 was highly expressed in the EC tissues and cells. In addition, high expression of SIX3 was related to poor survival. The knockdown of SIX3 significantly inhibited the proliferation, migration, and invasion of ECA109 cells. A similar pattern was also found in the proliferation and migration of SKGT-4 cell line. The expression levels of some key proteins in the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway were obviously decreased after cells were transfected with si-SIX3, possibly resulting in PI3K/AKT signaling inactivation. In addition, E-cadherin and N-cadherin showed some change. Collectively, the results shed light on a potentially promoting role of SIX3 in human EC. Thus, SIX3 might be considered a novel prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for EC patients."

The host protein cleavage-and-polyadenylation-specificity-factor-6 (CPSF6) has been implicated in different stages of early HIV-1 replication. Applying quantitative microscopy of HIV-1 reverse-transcription and pre-integration-complexes (RTC/PIC), we show that CPSF6 is strongly recruited to nuclear replication complexes but absent from cytoplasmic RTC/PIC in primary human macrophages. Depletion of CPSF6 or lack of CPSF6 binding led to accumulation of HIV-1 subviral complexes at the nuclear envelope of macrophages and reduced infectivity. Two-color stimulated-emission-depletion microscopy indicated that under these circumstances HIV-1 complexes are retained inside the nuclear pore and undergo CA-multimer dependent CPSF6 clustering adjacent to the nuclear basket. We propose that nuclear entry of HIV-1 subviral complexes in macrophages is mediated by consecutive binding of Nup153 and CPSF6 to the hexameric CA lattice.",S-cone photoreceptors in the primate retina are functionally distinct from L and M cones.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30672735,eLife,2019 06 12,"Daylight vision starts with signals in three classes of cone photoreceptors sensitive to short (S), middle (M), and long (L) wavelengths. Psychophysical studies show that perceptual sensitivity to rapidly varying inputs differs for signals originating in S cones versus L and M cones; notably, S-cone signals appear perceptually delayed relative to L- and M-cone signals. These differences could originate in the cones themselves or in the post-cone circuitry. To determine if the cones could contribute to these and related perceptual phenomena, we compared the light responses of primate S, M, and L cones. We found that S cones generate slower light responses than L and M cones, show much smaller changes in response kinetics as background-light levels increase, and are noisier than L and M cones. It will be important to incorporate these differences into descriptions of how cone signaling shapes human visual perception.",Anillin facilitates septin assembly to prevent pathological outfoldings of central nervous system myelin.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30672734,eLife,2019 01 29,"Myelin serves as an axonal insulator that facilitates rapid nerve conduction along axons. By transmission electron microscopy, a healthy myelin sheath comprises compacted membrane layers spiraling around the cross-sectioned axon. Previously we identified the assembly of septin filaments in the innermost non-compacted myelin layer as one of the latest steps of myelin maturation in the central nervous system (CNS) (Patzig et al., 2016). Here we show that loss of the cytoskeletal adaptor protein anillin (ANLN) from oligodendrocytes disrupts myelin septin assembly, thereby causing the emergence of pathological myelin outfoldings. Since myelin outfoldings are a poorly understood hallmark of myelin disease and brain aging we assessed axon/myelin-units in Anln-mutant mice by focused ion beam-scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM); myelin outfoldings were three-dimensionally reconstructed as large sheets of multiple compact membrane layers. We suggest that anillin-dependent assembly of septin filaments scaffolds mature myelin sheaths, facilitating rapid nerve conduction in the healthy CNS.",The Mitotic Exit Network integrates temporal and spatial signals by distributing regulation across multiple components.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30672733,eLife,2019 02 20,"GTPase signal transduction pathways control cellular decision making by integrating multiple cellular events into a single signal. The Mitotic Exit Network (MEN), a Ras-like GTPase signaling pathway, integrates spatial and temporal cues to ensure that cytokinesis only occurs after the genome has partitioned between mother and daughter cells during anaphase. Here we show that signal integration does not occur at a single step of the pathway. Rather, sequential components of the pathway are controlled in series by different signals. The spatial signal, nuclear position, regulates the MEN GTPase Tem1. The temporal signal, commencement of anaphase, is mediated by mitotic cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) phosphorylation of the GTPase's downstream kinases. We propose that integrating multiple signals through sequential steps in the GTPase pathway represents a generalizable principle in GTPase signaling and explains why intracellular signal transmission is a multi-step process. Serial signal integration rather than signal amplification makes multi-step signal transduction necessary.",Retrospective whole-genome sequencing analysis distinguished PFGE and drug-resistance-matched retail meat and clinical Salmonella isolates.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30672732,"Microbiology (Reading, England)",2019 06 10,"Non-typhoidal Salmonella is a leading cause of outbreak and sporadic-associated foodborne illnesses in the United States. These infections have been associated with a range of foods, including retail meats. Traditionally, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST) have been used to facilitate public health investigations of Salmonella infections. However, whole-genome sequencing (WGS) has emerged as an alternative tool that can be routinely implemented. To assess its potential in enhancing integrated surveillance in Pennsylvania, USA, WGS was used to directly compare the genetic characteristics of 7 retail meat and 43 clinical historic Salmonella isolates, subdivided into 3 subsets based on PFGE and AST results, to retrospectively resolve their genetic relatedness and identify antimicrobial resistance (AMR) determinants. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analyses revealed that the retail meat isolates within S. Heidelberg, S. Typhimurium var. O5- subset 1 and S. Typhimurium var. O5- subset 2 were separated from each primary PFGE pattern-matched clinical isolate by 6-12, 41-96 and 21-81 SNPs, respectively. Fifteen resistance genes were identified across all isolates, including fosA7, a gene only recently found in a limited number of Salmonella and a ≥95 % phenotype to genotype correlation was observed for all tested antimicrobials. Moreover, AMR was primarily plasmid-mediated in S. Heidelberg and S. Typhimurium var. O5- subset 2, whereas AMR was chromosomally carried in S. Typhimurium var. O5- subset 1. Similar plasmids were identified in both the retail meat and clinical isolates.

Virulence-associated genes (VAGs) carried by ColV and ColBM virulence plasmids, including those encoding protectins [iss (91/95, 96 %), ompT (91/95, 96 %) and traT (90/95, 95 %)], iron-acquisition systems [sitA (88/95, 93 %), etsA (87/95, 92 %), iroN (84/95, 89 %) and iucD/iutA (84/95, 89 %)] and the putative avian haemolysin hylF (91/95, 96 %), featured prominently. Notably, mobile resistance genes conferring resistance to fluoroquinolones, colistin, extended-spectrum β-lactams and carbapenems were not detected in the genomes of these 95 APEC but carriage of the sulphonamide resistance gene, sul1 (59/95, 63 %), the trimethoprim resistance gene cassettes dfrA5 (48/95, 50 %) and dfrA1 (25/95, 27 %), the tetracycline resistance determinant tet(A) (51/95, 55 %) and the ampicillin resistance genes blaTEM-1A/B/C (48/95, 52 %) was common. IS26 (77/95, 81 %), an insertion element known to capture and mobilize a wide spectrum of antimicrobial resistance genes, was also frequently identified.

The genomic DNA G+C content based on the whole genome sequence was 62.2 mol%. Phenotypic, chemotaxonomic, phylogenetic and genomic analyses suggested that strain c27j1T should represent a novel species of the genus Microvirga, for which the name Microvirgaflavescens sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is c27j1T (=GDMCC 1.1356T=KCTC 62433T). The description of the genus Microvirga is also emended, including the major fatty acids, genome size and DNA G+C content."

Given most of these games provide opportunities for competitive and cooperative play, they have the potential to build and enhance existing social relationships and might also provide an avenue for negative social experiences such as bullying or trolling behaviors. Unfortunately, little is understood about the prevalence or effects of cyberbullying for young people in this new form of electronic play. The present research, conducted in March 2018, surveyed a large and representative cohort of British adolescents and their caregivers (n = 2,008) with the aim of building an empirical understanding of this phenomenon. Adolescents were asked about their play habits and experiences, and caregivers provided data on their children's socioeconomic and demographic background and psychosocial functioning. Of key interest was estimating how frequently adolescents encounter bullying in mobile games, the extent to which bullying impacts them, and the sources of support adolescents seek following these events. Results indicated that bullying in mobile games is relatively common (33.5%), although less than 1 in 10 experiences serious repeated bullying (9.3%). Analysis showed males, players from a minority ethnicity, and those whose caregivers identified as having conduct problems, were the most likely to report significant victimization. Furthermore, nearly 4 in 10 (39.4%) reported feeling fairly or very upset by the experience and parents (49.3%), not gaming platforms (4.2%), were most likely to be sought out for support after bullying was experienced.

However, the effect of type III IFN on the prognosis of patients with gastric cancer (GC) is controversial. This study aimed to investigate the effects of serum IFN-α, IFN-β, IFN-γ, IFN-λ1, and IFN-λ2/3 levels on the survival of patients with GC. LEGENDplex bead-based immunoassays were used to analyze the serum IFN-α, IFN-β, IFN-γ, IFN-λ1, and IFN-λ2/3 levels in patients with GC and healthy volunteers. Flow cytometry was used to test the IFN concentrations. Compared with the healthy controls, the patients with GC had significantly decreased serum IFN-α, IFN-γ, and IFN-λ1 levels, but significantly increased serum IFN-λ2/3 level. Analysis of the serum IFN concentrations and clinical parameters of the patients with GC showed significant correlations of serum IFN-α, IFN-β, IFN-γ, and IFN-λ2/3 levels with clinical stages. Serum IFN-λ1 levels significantly correlated with tumor location, histopathology, and lymph node involvement. Serum IFN-λ2/3 levels significantly correlated with lymph node involvement and distant metastasis. In addition, serum IFN-α, IFN-β, and IFN-γ levels significantly correlated with clinical stage and lymph node metastasis. Serum IFN-β and IFN-γ levels also significantly correlated with Lauren classification. Furthermore, the patients with stage IV GC exhibited significantly lower IFN-λ2/3 levels and higher IFN-α, IFN-β, and IFN-γ levels than the patients with stage I-III GC. The univariate analysis revealed that tumor sizes of >5 cm, higher clinical stage, and high IFN-λ2/3 level were significantly associated with poor prognosis. This study shows the relationship between serum IFN level and GC progression. High serum IFN-λ2/3 levels were associated with poor prognosis and could be a novel biomarker for evaluating GC progression and predicting the outcomes of nonmetastatic GC.",Development of Virtual Reality Continuous Performance Test Utilizing Social Cues for Children and Adolescents with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30672714,"Cyberpsychology, behavior and social networking",2019 04 29,"Virtual reality (VR) neuropsychological assessments have the potential for the ecological measurement of attention. We analyzed the newly developed VR continuous performance test (VR-CPT) for Korean children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and typically developing children (TDC). To identify specific features of a virtual environment that influence the attention performance of children, we investigated whether the presence of a virtual teacher and social cues in the VR environment affects their attention performance. A total of 38 participants (18 TDC and 20 ADHD children and adolescents) were recruited for VR-CPT testing. Bivariate correlational analysis was conducted to examine the associations between the results of the VR-CPT and ADHD questionnaires to determine the capacity of VR-CPT to mirror real-life attention behaviors. Mixed-design analysis of variables was conducted to compare the effects of the social aspects of the VR-CPT on attention performance in groups. There were significant associations between ADHD rating scores and the omission error, commission error, reaction time (RT), reaction time variability (RTV), and total accuracy of the VR-CPT in the ADHD group. In addition, the ADHD group exhibited comparable performance with the TDC group for all measures of the VR-CPT. Also there seemed to be a trend of decreasing RTV when a virtual teacher with social cues was present compared with the equipment control condition in the ADHD group. Performance in the VR-CPT program was associated with behavioral measures of ADHD symptoms. Adding social aspects to a VR environment commonly encountered by children and adolescents has the potential to make a difference in the attention performance of youths with ADHD.",LPS removal reduces CD80-mediated albuminuria in critically ill patients with Gram-negative sepsis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30672713,American journal of physiology. Renal physiology,2019 04 04,"LPS-induced sepsis is a leading cause of acute kidney injury (AKI) in critically ill patients. LPS may induce CD80 expression in podocytes with subsequent onset of proteinuria, a risk factor for progressive chronic kidney disease (CKD) frequently observed after AKI. This study aimed to investigate the therapeutic efficacy of LPS removal in decreasing albuminuria through the reduction of podocyte CD80 expression. Between January 2015 and December 2017, 70 consecutive patients with Gram-negative sepsis-induced AKI were randomized to either have coupled plasma filtration and adsorption (CPFA) added to the standard care ( n = 35) or not ( n = 35). To elucidate the possible relationship between LPS-induced renal damage, proteinuria, and CD80 expression in Gram sepsis, a swine model of LPS-induced AKI was set up. Three hours after LPS infusion, animals were treated or not with CPFA for 6 h. Treatment with CPFA significantly reduced serum cytokines, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, and endotoxin levels in patients with Gram-negative sepsis-induced AKI. CPFA significantly lowered also proteinuria and CD80 urinary excretion. In the swine model of LPS-induced AKI, CD80 glomerular expression, which was undetectable in control pigs, was markedly increased at the podocyte level in LPS-exposed animals. CPFA significantly reduced LPS-induced proteinuria and podocyte CD80 expression in septic pigs. Our data indicate that LPS induces albuminuria via podocyte expression of CD80 and suggest a possible role of timely LPS removal in preventing the maladaptive repair of the podocytes and the consequent increased risk of CKD in sepsis-induced AKI.",Learning to Rate Player Positioning in Soccer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30672712,Big data,2019 03 19,"We investigate how to learn functions that rate game situations on a soccer pitch according to their potential to lead to successful attacks.

It is noteworthy that the quenched fluorescence of the Fe(III)-incorporated sample could be reopened linearly with an increase of alkalinity, followed by the reactivation of its functionality to identify Fe(III) ions, forming an alternate detection cycle for Fe(III) and pH with off-on-off fluorescent switch characteristics. Considering its unique molecular recognition capability, an advanced three-input (Fe(III), EDTA, and OH-) and two-output (B440 and G489) Boolean logic operation comprising BUFF, NOT, OR, and AND logic gates was integrated, possessing potential applications in intelligent multianalyte sensing systems.",Halogen Bonding Interactions for Aromatic and Nonaromatic Explosive Detection.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30672707,ACS sensors,2019 02 22,"Improved sensing strategies are needed for facile, accurate, and rapid detection of aromatic and nonaromatic explosives. Density functional theory was used to evaluate the relative binding interaction energies between halogen-containing sensor model molecules and nitro-containing explosives. Interaction energies ranged from -18 to -14 kJ/mol and highly directional halogen bonding interactions were observed with bond distances ranging between 3.0 and 3.4 Å. In all geometry optimized structures, the sigma-hole of electropositive potential on the halogen aligned with a lone pair of electrons on the nitro-moiety of the explosive. The computational results predict that the strongest interactions will occur with iodine-based sensors as, of all the halogens studied, iodine is the largest, most polarizable halogen with the smallest electronegativity. Based on these promising proof-of-concept results, synthetically accessible sensors were designed using 1,4-dihalobenzene (X = Cl, Br, and I) with and without tetra-fluoro electron withdrawing groups attached to the benzene ring. These sensing molecules were embedded onto single walled carbon nanotubes that were mechanically abraded onto interdigitated array electrodes, and these were used to measure the responses to explosive model compounds cyclohexanone and dimethyl-dinitro-benzene in nitrogen gas. Amperometric current-time curves for selectors and control molecules, including concentration correlated signal enhancement, as well as response and recovery times, indicate selector responsiveness to these model compounds, with the largest response observed for iodo-substituted sensors."

Different reactant gases (Ar, He, O2, and N2) and reactant gas mixtures are tested with regard to the DBDI performance and then used to improve the ionization efficiency.

Metabolites (e.g., desphenylchloridazon from chloridazon) may be persistent and even more polar than the parent herbicide, which increases the risk of groundwater contamination. When parent herbicides are still applied, metabolites are constantly formed and may also be degraded. Evaluating their degradation on the basis of concentration measurements is, therefore, difficult. This study presents compound-specific stable-isotope analysis (CSIA) of nitrogen- and carbon-isotope ratios at natural abundances as an alternative analytical approach to track the origin, formation, and degradation of desphenylchloridazon (DPC), the major degradation product of the herbicide chloridazon. Methods were developed and validated for carbon- and nitrogen-isotope analysis (δ13C and δ15N) of DPC by liquid chromatography-isotope-ratio mass spectrometry (LC-IRMS) and derivatization gas chromatography-IRMS (GC-IRMS), respectively. Injecting standards directly onto an Atlantis LC-column resulted in reproducible δ13C-isotope analysis (standard deviation <0.5‰) by LC-IRMS with a limit of precise analysis of 996 ng of DPC on-column. Accurate and reproducible δ15N analysis with a standard deviation of <0.4‰ was achieved by GC-IRMS after derivatization of >100 ng of DPC with 160-fold excess of (trimethylsilyl)diazomethane. Application of the method to environmental-seepage water indicated that newly formed DPC could be distinguished from ""old"" DPC by the different isotopic signatures of the two DPC sources.",Quantitative Comparison of Enrichment from DNA-Encoded Chemical Library Selections.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30672692,ACS combinatorial science,2019 02 26,"DNA-encoded chemical libraries (DELs) provide a high-throughput and cost-effective route for screening billions of unique molecules for binding affinity for diverse protein targets. Identifying candidate compounds from these libraries involves affinity selection, DNA sequencing, and measuring enrichment in a sample pool of DNA barcodes. Successful detection of potent binders is affected by many factors, including selection parameters, chemical yields, library amplification, sequencing depth, sequencing errors, library sizes, and the chosen enrichment metric. To date, there has not been a clear consensus about how enrichment from DEL selections should be measured or reported. We propose a normalized  z-score enrichment metric using a binomial distribution model that satisfies important criteria that are relevant for analysis of DEL selection data. The introduced metric is robust with respect to library diversity and sampling and allows for quantitative comparisons of enrichment of n-synthons from parallel DEL selections. These features enable a comparative enrichment analysis strategy that can provide valuable information about hit compounds in early stage drug discovery.",Thrombin Exosite Maturation and Ligand Binding at ABE II Help Stabilize PAR-Binding Competent Conformation at ABE I.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30672691,Biochemistry,2019 02 26,"Thrombin, derived from zymogen prothrombin (ProT), is a serine protease involved in procoagulation, anticoagulation, and platelet activation. Thrombin's actions are regulated through anion-binding exosites I and II (ABE I and ABE II) that undergo maturation during activation. Mature ABEs can utilize exosite-based communication to fulfill thrombin functions. However, the conformational basis behind such long-range communication and the resultant ligand binding affinities are not well understood. Protease activated receptors (PARs), involved in platelet activation and aggregation, are known to target thrombin ABE I. Unexpectedly, PAR3 (44-56) can already bind to pro-ABE I of ProT. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) ligand-enzyme titrations were used to characterize how individual PAR1 (49-62) residues interact with pro-ABE I and mature ABE I. 1D proton line broadening studies demonstrated that binding affinities for native PAR1P (49-62, P54) and for the weak binding variant PAR1G (49-62, P54G) increased as ProT was converted to mature thrombin. 1H,15N-HSQC titrations revealed that PAR1G residues K51, E53, F55, D58, and E60 exhibited less affinity to pro-ABE I than comparable residues in PAR3G (44-56, P51G). Individual PAR1G residues then displayed tighter binding upon exosite maturation. Long-range communication between thrombin exosites was examined by saturating ABE II with phosphorylated GpIbα (269-282, 3Yp) and monitoring the binding of PAR1 and PAR3 peptides to ABE I. Individual PAR residues exhibited increased affinities in this dual-ligand environment supporting the presence of interexosite allostery. Exosite maturation and beneficial long-range allostery are proposed to help stabilize an ABE I conformation that can effectively bind PAR ligands.",Degas-Driven Deterministic Lateral Displacement in Poly(dimethylsiloxane) Microfluidic Devices.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30672690,Analytical chemistry,2019 02 19,"In this work, degas-driven microfluidic deterministic lateral displacement devices were fabricated from poly(dimethylsiloxane).

Using the single-input device, the characteristics of the degas-driven fluid through micropillars were investigated, and then selective enrichment of fluorescent polymer particles with diameters of around 13 μm mixed with similar 7 μm particles was demonstrated. Using the sheath-input device, the separation of 13 and 7 μm beads was achieved (the corresponding purities exceeded 92.62% and 99.98%, respectively). In addition, clusters composed of 7 μm beads (including doublets, triplets, and quadruplets) were fractionated based on their equivalent sizes. Finally, white blood cells could be separated from red blood cells at a relatively high capture efficiency (95.57%) and purity (86.97%).","Highly Uniform, Flexible Microelectrodes Based on the Clean Single-Walled Carbon Nanotube Thin Film with High Electrochemical Activity.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30672689,ACS applied materials & interfaces,2019 02 26,"Electrochemical sensors based on carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have great potential for use in wearable or implantable biomedical sensor applications because of their excellent mechanical flexibility and biocompatibility. However, the main challenge associated with CNT-based sensors is their uniform and reproducible fabrication on the flexible plastic film. Here, we introduce and demonstrate a highly reliable technique to fabricate flexible CNT microelectrodes on a plastic film. The technique involves a process whereby the CNT film is formed by the dry transfer process based on the floating-catalyst chemical vapor deposition. An oxide protection layer, which is used to cover the CNT thin film during the fabrication process, minimizes contamination of the surface. The fabricated flexible CNT microelectrodes show almost ideal electrochemical characteristics for microelectrodes with the average value of the quartile potentials, Δ E = | E3/4 - E1/4|, being 60.4 ± 2.9 mV for the 28 electrodes, while the ideal value of Δ E = 56.4 mV. The CNT microelectrodes also showed enhanced resistance to surface fouling during dopamine oxidation in comparison to carbon fiber and gold microelectrodes; the degradation of the oxidation current after 10 consecutive cycles were 1.8, 8.3, and 13.9% for CNT, carbon fiber, and gold microelectrodes, respectively. The high-sensitivity detection of dopamine is also demonstrated with differential-pulse voltammetry, with a resulting limit of detection of ∼50 nM.

Here, we report the first successful flash ignition of a pure carbon material in ambient air microporous carbon aerogels (CAs) with ultralow density and high surface area. Under flash exposure, the CAs show a strong local heat confinement effect near microporous structures (0.6-2 nm), and the graphite crystallite structures existing in single carbon nanoparticles (∼15 nm) are damaged. The local heat confinement effects are mainly derived from the low gaseous thermal conductivity in micropores and low solid thermal conductivity in low-density CAs. In addition, the limiting effects of the microporous structure on the vibration amplitude of free-state electrons in low-density CAs result in a dramatic increase in optical absorption. Numerical simulations of unsteady temperature fields of CAs with different densities and thicknesses are also performed, and the calculated maximum temperature of a 17 μm-thick 20 mg/cm3 CA bed is 1782 °C. CAs with higher density can also give rise to enhanced photothermal response and ignition with the addition of metal Fe nanoparticles. The metal catalyst increases both the light absorption capacity in the visible-light range and the heat accumulation capacity. These results are important for understanding the mechanism of flash ignition, especially the local high temperature and effects of metal catalyst in carbon materials during the photothermal process.",Characterization and Optimization of Multiplexed Quantitative Analyses Using High-Field Asymmetric-Waveform Ion Mobility Mass Spectrometry.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30672687,Analytical chemistry,2019 03 19,"Multiplexed, isobaric tagging methods are powerful techniques to increase throughput, precision, and accuracy in quantitative proteomics. The dynamic range and accuracy of quantitation, however, can be limited by coisolation of tag-containing peptides that release reporter ions and conflate quantitative measurements across precursors. Methods to alleviate these effects often lead to the loss of protein and peptide identifications through online or offline filtering of interference containing spectra. To alleviate this effect, high-Field Asymmetric-waveform Ion Mobility Spectroscopy (FAIMS) has been proposed as a method to reduce precursor coisolation and improve the accuracy and dynamic range of multiplex quantitation. Here we tested the use of FAIMS to improve quantitative accuracy using previously established TMT-based interference standards (triple-knockout [TKO] and Human-Yeast Proteomics Resource [HYPER]). We observed that FAIMS robustly improved the quantitative accuracy of both high-resolution MS2 (HRMS2) and synchronous precursor selection MS3 (SPS-MS3)-based methods without sacrificing protein identifications. We further optimized and characterized the main factors that enable robust use of FAIMS for multiplexed quantitation.

In this work, we illustrate a combinatorial chemical imaging approach to study seed coatings at the microscale to link chemical and physical properties responsible for low seed flowability. The local chemical composition was examined using time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) and at comparable length scales, the local adhesive properties were examined using atomic force microscopy (AFM) force volume mapping. The link between the chemical and the adhesive properties was established by non-negative matrix factorization (NMF).

In this study, a scalable green method was proposed to produce polypropylene (PP)/poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE) composite foams via conventional processing techniques including twin-screw extrusion and supercritical carbon dioxide foaming. To produce the superhydrophobic foam, micro- and nanosized PTFE particles were melt blended with PP and subsequently foamed. Ascribed to the nanofibrillation of microsized PTFE during processing, the fabricated foam exhibited a special highly porous structure with PTFE nanofibrils and nanoparticles uniformly distributed on the pore surfaces within the PP matrix, which resulted in a remarkably high water contact angle of 156.8° and a low contact angle hysteresis of 1.9°. Unlike traditional surface-modified superhydrophobic absorbers, the foams prepared are entirely superhydrophobic, which means that they remain superhydrophobic when being fractured or cut. Moreover, they are highly durable and maintained the superhydrophobicity when subjected to ultrasonication and mechanical sanding. When used in selective oil absorption, the durable foams exhibited excellent absorption efficiency and high stability in repetitive and long-term use. These advantages make the PP/PTFE foam a promising superabsorbent material for water remediation."

The adipokines play an important role in development of complications caused by obesity. nowadays, retinol-binding protein 4 (RBP4), one of adipokines identified recently, is considered as a connecting link between obesity and its complications. Adipokine participates in development of resistance to insulin and correlated with cardio-metabolic markers at chronic inflammatory diseases, including diabetes mellitus type II, metabolic syndrome and cardio-vascular diseases. It is considered that inflammation, produced by RBP4, induces resistance to insulin and cardio-vascular diseases. It seems that RBP4 is an adipokine that both induces resistance to insulin and participates in pathogenesis of other metabolic complications of obesity. This is confirmed by a tight relationship between RBP4 and atherogenic lipoproteins, atherosclerotic affection of vessels and cardio-vascular diseases. However, an important restriction in certain studies related to RBP4 is that they included patients who received medicinal therapy (sugar lowering and hypo-lipidemic pharmaceuticals) or had renal and hepatic insufficiency. The mentioned factors impact concentration of RBP4 in blood and hence can distort the results. In spite of that, the established potential metabolic role of RBP4 requires a further investigation. Besides further carefully planned studies are required focusing on establishing is RBP4 a molecular participator of molecular alterations or it is only a dynamically volatile ""witness"". The present review summarizes actual knowledge concerning the role of RBP4 under obesity, in development of dyslipidemia, insulin resistance and cardio-vascular diseases. The purpose of the study is to summarize data of studying of inflammatory and immune effects of RBP4 especially in case of cardio-vascular diseases and also establishment of perspective of applying retinol-binding protein as a potential biomarker of cardiovascular risk.","[Phylogenetic theory of general pathology. Pericytes, function of the distal arterial bed, metabolic arterial hypertension and hypovolemic shock.]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30672669,Klinicheskaia laboratornaia diagnostika,2019 03 23,"The in vivo roles of pericyte contractile sphincters, smooth muscle cells, endothelial monolayer, precapillary muscle arterioles, exchange and volume capillaries in the physiological balance between peripheral blood pool and the blood pool volume in the distal arterial bed are not fully understood. However, it is highly probable that: 1. There is no primary arterial hypertension. The compensatory biological reaction of arterial pressure (AP) is always secondary, thus indicating the presence of symptomatic or metabolic arterial hypertension (AH). 2. Elevation of AP in proximal arterial bed is a compensatory response to metabolic disorders and impaired microcirculation and metabolism↔microcirculation biological reaction. The response develops locally in the distal arterial bed (muscle arterioles, functional sphincters, pericytes). 3. Metabolic AH is a pathology of the phylogenetically early distal arterial bed , endothelial monolayer, smooth muscle cell and pericyte function. 4. We believe that formation of acute hypovolemic shock is the condition of sphincter (pericyte) atonia in precapillary muscle arterioles with formation of a nonphysiological blood volume in the distal arterial bed when physiological volume of peripheral blood is insufficient to fill the bed. 5. When local disorder in the biological reaction metabolism↔microcirculation is not compensated by endothelium-dependent vasodilation, an efferent innervation signal from the vasomotor center at the entire organism level is sent to the heart and systemic AP increases first in the proximal then in the distal arterial bed. 6. Systemic AP elevation impairs function of the target organs: kidneys, brain and lungs. Each of these organs regulates hydrodynamics in the local pool of extracellular medium, their dysfunction inducing a compensatory response. 7. Metabolic arterial hypertension results from discoordinated systemic compensation of local disorders in the following biological functions: homeostasis, endoecology, trophology and adaptation. This discoordination occurs at the level of paracrine regulated cell communities of functionally different cells which are structural units of each internal organ.",Recurrent Bell's palsy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30672667,Clinical otolaryngology : official journal of ENT-UK ; official journal of Netherlands Society for Oto-Rhino-Laryngology & Cervico-Facial Surgery,2019 04 29,"Although recurrent facial palsy was first reported in 1871, the aetiology, definitions, classifications, pathogenesis, treatment options and prognosis have not been clearly determined.

We performed a secondary analysis of the CI-PeriNomS study which included 281 patients with stable CIPN. We tested: (a) the association between patients' perception of activity limitation in performing eight common tasks and neurological impairment and (b) how the responses to questions related to these daily activities are interpreted by the treating oncologist. To achieve this, we compared patients' perception of their activity limitation with neurological assessment and the oncologists' blind interpretation. Distribution of the scores attributed by oncologists to each daily life maximum limitation (""impossible"") generated three groups: Group 1 included limitations oncologists attributed mainly to motor impairment; Group 2 ones mainly attributed to sensory impairment and Group 3 ones with uncertain motor and sensory impairment. Only a subset of questions showed a significant trend between severity in subjective limitation, reported by patients, and neurological impairment. In Group 1, neurological examination confirmed motor impairment in only 51%-65% of patients; 76%-78% of them also had vibration perception impairment. In Group 2, sensory impairment ranged from 84% to 100%; some degree of motor impairment occurred in 43%-56% of them. In Group 3 strength reduction was observed in 49%-50% and sensory perception was altered in up to 82%. Interpretation provided by the panel of experienced oncologists was inconsistent with the neurological impairment.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the association between clinical risk factors and outcomes in ischemic stroke patients that received thrombolysis therapy pretreated with antihypertensive medications. Using data obtained from a stroke registry, a non-randomized retrospective data analysis was conducted on patients with the primary diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke with hypertension pretreated with antihypertensive medications. The association between clinical risk factors and functional ambulatory outcome was determined using logistic regression while odd ratios (OR) were used to predict the odds of achieving improved ambulatory outcome in thrombolysis treatment status. Improved or poor functional ambulatory outcome was considered as the end point in our analysis. A total of 4665 acute ischemic stroke patients were identified, of whom 1446 (31.0%) were eligible for thrombolysis, while 3219 were not, and 595 received rtPA, of whom 288 were on antihypertensive medications, while 233 were not.

Yet in many eusocial insects, workers retain the ability to produce haploid male offspring from unfertilized eggs. The reproductive potential of workers has well-documented consequences for the structure and function of insect colonies, but its implications at the population level are less often considered. We show that worker reproduction in honey bees can have an important role in maintaining genetic diversity at the sex locus in invasive populations. The honey bee sex locus is homozygous-lethal, and, all else being equal, a higher allele number in the population lead to higher mean brood survival. In an invasive population of the honey bee Apis cerana in Australia, workers contribute significantly to male production: 38% of male-producing colonies are queenless, and these contribute one-third of all males at mating congregations. Using a model, we show that such male production by queenless workers will increase the number of sex alleles retained in nascent invasive populations following founder events, relative to a scenario in which only queens reproduce. We conclude that by rescuing sex locus diversity that would otherwise be lost, workers' sons help honey bee populations to minimize the negative effects of inbreeding after founder events and so contribute to their success as invaders.",Synthesis and Characterization of Surface-Active Ionic Liquids Used in the Disruption of Escherichia Coli Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30672638,Chemphyschem : a European journal of chemical physics and physical chemistry,2019 03 27,"Twelve surface-active ionic liquids (SAILs) and surface-active derivatives, based on imidazolium, ammonium, and phosphonium cations and containing one, or more, long alkyl chains in the cation and/or the anion, were synthetized and characterized.

The CMC values obtained (0.03-6.0 mM) show a high propensity of these compounds to self-aggregate in aqueous media. Their thermal properties were also characterized, namely the melting point and decomposition temperature by using DSC and TGA, respectively. Furthermore, the toxicity of these SAILs was evaluated using the marine bacteria Aliivibrio fischeri (Gram-negative).

The Asian long-horned beetle (ALB) Anoplophora glabripennis is a xylophagous pest native to Asia and invasive in North America and Europe. It is responsible for severe losses of urban trees, in both its native and invaded ranges. Based on historical and genetic data, several hypotheses have been formulated concerning its invasion history, including the possibility of multiple introductions from the native zone and secondary dispersal within the invaded areas, but none have been formally tested. In this study, we characterized the genetic structure of ALB in both its native and invaded ranges using microsatellites. In order to test different invasion scenarios, we used an approximate Bayesian ""random forest"" algorithm together with traditional population genetics approaches. The strong population differentiation observed in the native area was not geographically structured, suggesting complex migration events that were probably human-mediated. Both native and invasive populations had low genetic diversity, but this characteristic did not prevent the success of the ALB invasions. Our results highlight the complexity of invasion pathways for insect pests. Specifically, our findings indicate that invasive species might be repeatedly introduced from their native range, and they emphasize the importance of multiple, human-mediated introductions in successful invasions. Finally, our results demonstrate that invasive species can spread across continents following a bridgehead path, in which an invasive population may have acted as a source for another invasion.",Supramolecular Gel Based on Crown-Ether-Appended Dynamic Covalent Macrocycles.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30672634,Macromolecular rapid communications,2019 01 23,"A new type of dynamic covalent macrocycle with self-promoted supramolecular gelation behavior is developed.

Baseline population estimates, against which future observations may be compared, are necessary if we are to detect ecological change. Arctic sea ice ecosystems are changing rapidly and we lack baseline population estimates for many ice-associated species. Provided we can detect them, changes in Arctic marine ecosystems may be signaled by changes in indicator species such as ringed seals (Pusa hispida). Ringed seal monitoring has provided estimates of survival and fertility rates, but these have not been used for population-level inference. Using matrix population models, we synthesized existing demographic parameters to obtain estimates of historical ringed seal population growth and structure in Amundsen Gulf and Prince Albert Sound, Canada. We then formalized existing hypotheses about the effects of emerging environmental stressors (i.e., earlier spring ice breakup and reduced snow depth) on ringed seal pup survival. Coupling the demographic model to ice and snow forecasts available from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project resulted in projections of ringed seal population size and structure up to the year 2100. These projections showed median declines in population size ranging from 50% to 99%. Corresponding to these projected declines were substantial changes in population structure, with increasing proportions of ringed seal pups and adults and declining proportions of juveniles. We explored if currently collected, harvest-based data could be used to detect the projected changes in population stage structure. Our model suggests that at a present sample size of 100 seals per year, the projected changes in stage structure would only be reliably detected by mid-century, even for the most extreme climate models. This modeling process revealed inconsistencies in existing estimates of ringed seal demographic rates. Mathematical population models such as these can contribute both to understanding past population trends as well as predicting future ones, both of which are necessary if we are to detect and interpret future observations.",Lectin pathway proteins of the complement system in normotensive pregnancy and pre-eclampsia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30672631,"American journal of reproductive immunology (New York, N.Y. : 1989)",2019 04 08,"The lectin pathway of the complement system may be involved in the pathogenesis of pre-eclampsia.

These results indicated that oral administration with monosodium glutamate (MSG) at 0.50 g/kg BW/day improved SP intestinal morphology and increased caecal and colonal VFA contents.",A New Type of Li-Rich Rock-Salt Oxide Li2 Ni1/3 Ru2/3 O3 with Reversible Anionic Redox Chemistry.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30672613,"Advanced materials (Deerfield Beach, Fla.)",2019 03 13,"Li-rich oxide cathodes are of prime importance for the development of high-energy lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). Li-rich layered oxides, however, always undergo irreversible structural evolution, leading to inevitable capacity and voltage decay during cycling. Meanwhile, Li-rich cation-disordered rock-salt oxides usually exhibit sluggish kinetics and inferior cycling stability, despite their firm structure and stable voltage output. Herein, a new Li-rich rock-salt oxide Li2 Ni1/3 Ru2/3 O3 with Fd-3m space group, where partial cation-ordering arrangement exists in cationic sites, is reported. Results demonstrate that a cathode fabricated from Li2 Ni1/3 Ru2/3 O3 delivers a large capacity, outstanding rate capability as well as good cycling performance with negligible voltage decay, in contrast to the common cations disordered oxides with space group Fm-3m. First principle calculations also indicate that rock-salt oxide with space group Fd-3m possesses oxygen activity potential at the state of delithiation, and good kinetics with more 0-TM (TM = transition metals) percolation networks. In situ Raman results confirm the reversible anionic redox chemistry, confirming O2- /O- evolution during cycles in Li-rich rock-salt cathode for the first time. These findings open up the opportunity to design high-performance oxide cathodes and promote the development of high-energy LIBs.",Results of a retrospective study on the efficacy and safety of adalimumab 80 mg administrated every other week in patients with psoriasis at a single Japanese institution.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30672612,The Journal of dermatology,2019 03 04,"Adalimumab (ADA) is one of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α monoclonal antibodies used for the treatment of psoriasis. In Japan, standard dosing of ADA for adults is an initial s.c. injection of 80 mg, followed by 40 mg every other week. Some patients who initially do not respond to treatment are allowed an increased dose of 80 mg every other week. However, studies on the efficacy and safety of ADA dose escalation to 80 mg every other week are few. In this study, we retrospectively studied 92 patients with psoriasis who received ADA therapy in our hospital. In 45 out of 92 patients, the dose of ADA 80 mg was administrated every other week, and the efficacy was observed within 12 weeks. The most common adverse drug reaction was upper respiratory infection, followed by diarrhea. In three patients, malignancies occurred during the observation period. No deaths or other severe complications were observed. In conclusion, this study showed the efficacy and safety of ADA dose escalation to 80 mg every other week in patients with psoriasis.",Caspofungin for primary antifungal prophylaxis after T-cell-replete haploidentical stem cell transplantation with post-transplant cyclophosphamide.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30672611,European journal of haematology,2019 03 14,"T-cell-replete haploidentical stem cell transplantation (Haplo-SCT) with post-transplant cyclophosphamide (PT-Cy) is at high risk of invasive fungal infections (IFI), and anti-mold-active drug is required for primary antifungal prophylaxis (PAP) according to international guidelines.

This study reports on Santa Barbara Amorphous (SBA-15), a type of mesoporous silica nanoparticles, for efficient and stable acetylcholinesterase (AChE) adhesion toward detection of toxic pesticides. AChE was immobilized to the inert framework of mesoporous materials viz. SBA-15 with a proficient hydrolytic response toward acetylthiocholine. The immobilized system acts as a biosensor for the detection of pesticides, which are organophosphorus compounds in food. Both the SBA-15 and immobilized SBA-15 were characterized to give an insight on the physiochemical and morphological modification properties. The enzyme activity was accessed by Ellman's spectrophotometric bioassay for bare and enzyme-immobilized SBA-15 that resulted in promising enzymatic activity with the counterpart. Enzyme stability was also studied, which exhibited that immobilized AChE retained its catalytic activity up to 60 days and retained 80% of the hydrolytic activity even at 37°C. On the basis of the success of immobilized enzyme (covalent) being inhibited by acetylthiocholine, the sensor was administered for the inhibition by monocrotophos and dimethoate that are used widely as pesticides in agricultural. The inhibitory concentration (IC50 ) value was found to be 2.5 ppb for monocrotophos and 1.5 ppb for dimethoate inhibiting immobilized AChE. This was verified using cyclic voltammetry, an electrochemical analysis thus proving that the SBA-15@AChE complex could be used as a sensitive and highly stable sensor for detecting the concentration of hazardous pesticide compounds."

The effect of both mutations in important DNA repair genes on sporadic PDAC risk may shed light on the genetic architecture of this disease. Both mutations were genotyped in germline DNA from 2,935 sporadic PDAC cases and 5,626 control subjects within the PANcreatic Disease ReseArch (PANDoRA) consortium. Risk estimates were evaluated using multivariate unconditional logistic regression with adjustment for possible confounders such as sex, age and country of origin.

In this paper, we present a highly sensitive and compatible gold nanoparticle (AuNP)-based, two-step signal amplification system for biomarker detection. First, AuNPs were coated onto the surfaces of 96-well plates to generate rough surfaces, which enable immobilization of many more capture antibodies than a smooth substrate. As a result, detection sensitivity was enhanced significantly. Second, the horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated detection antibodies were labeled on large-size AuNPs, which increase the localized amounts of HRP and thus further lower the detection limit. Based on the consecutive signal amplification system, a high-sensitivity assay was achieved, with a LOD of 0.07 ng/mL for prostate-specific antigen (PSA). This assay was allowed to detect the PSA levels in clinical samples without changing the current standard immunoassay setups, showing great potential in many settings where immunoassays are needed.",Ethanol Extract of Chinese Propolis Attenuates Early Diabetic Retinopathy by Protecting the Blood-Retinal Barrier in Streptozotocin-Induced Diabetic Rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30672592,Journal of food science,2019 04 03,"Propolis has been shown to reduce the level of blood glucose and suppress the histopathological changes in diabetics. However, it still remains unknown if propolis has a similar effect on diabetic retinopathy (DR). Our study aimed to evaluate the effect of the ethanol extract of Chinese propolis (EECP) on early DR in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats. EECP was given to diabetic rats by oral intubation for 12 weeks. The concentrations of fasting blood glucose (FBG), glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), malondialdehyde (MDA), reactive oxygen species (ROS), and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) were measured. Pathological examinations, including hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and immunofluorescence, were also conducted to provide further evidence of EECP's effect on early DR. EECP was able to attenuate diabetes via directly decreasing the levels of FBG and HbA1c, which also resulted in the reduction of MDA, ROS, and RNS. Furthermore, EECP could protect against the damages of photoreceptor cells, as well as retinal thickening. And the inhibition of blood-retinal barrier (BRB) leakage was also observed in EECP-treated diabetic rats, along with the inhibition the loss of tight junction proteins (occludin, ZO-1). These results suggest that EECP has an ameliorating effect on early DR by inhibition of blood-retinal barrier breakdown. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: This study sheds light on the protective effect of the ethanol extract of Chinese propolis on early diabetic retinopathy and the molecular actions underlying the inhibition of blood-retinal barrier breakdown. Our study suggests that ethanol extract of Chinese propolis can be considered as a potential therapeutic agent in the treatment of early diabetic retinopathy.",Posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms and mindfulness facets in relation to suicide risk among firefighters.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30672591,Journal of clinical psychology,2019 04 01,"Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms are associated with increased suicide risk among firefighters.

Gut microbiota diversity is strongly associated with chronic inflammatory disease, diabetes mellitus (DM), and obesity through abnormal energy homeostasis. In this study, the association between metabolic responses and gut microbiota diversity at different dietary n-6/n-3 PUFA ratios was evaluated in DM rats. Obesity and DM were induced in rats by using a high-fat diet and streptozotocin (STZ), respectively. The obese DM rats were assigned to three groups and administered regular (R), high (H), and low (L) n-6/n-3 ratio diets (n-6/n-3 = 6.39, 3.02, and 9.29, respectively) for 6 weeks. Some metabolic parameters and gut microbiota of the rats were analysed. The results revealed that a high linoleic acid diet increased the plasma and kidney interleukin 6 levels, whereas a low n-6/n-3 ratio diet ameliorated blood glucose homeostasis, reduced plasma tumour necrosis factor α levels, and inhibited systematic inflammation. DM rats exhibited low gut microbiota diversity; however, compared with the R group, the L and H groups did not exhibit alterations in the α-diversity (Observed, Chao 1, Shannon and Simpson). The percentage of Firmicutes was lower in the DM groups than in the non-DM group; however, the L group showed a nonsignificantly higher Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio than did the other groups. Thus, a low n-6/n-3 ratio diet can improve blood glucose homeostasis, reduce systematic inflammation, ameliorate glomerular basal membrane thickening, reduce the expression of receptors of advanced glycation end products in renal vessel walls, and prevent diabetic nephropathies.",Unusually fast and large actuation from multilayer polyelectrolyte thin films.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30672575,Soft matter,2019 03 13,"Polymers responsive to external stimuli (e.g., electric field, chemical vapor, light) are of great interest for smart materials such as sensors and soft robotics.

In the present study, we designed a micro-/nano-structured calcium phosphate bioceramic composed of a nanoparticle-reinforced micro-whisker backbone (nwCaP). This sandwich-structured bioceramic exhibited a higher compressive strength, a suitable degradation rate and better cell attachment than traditional or intermediate bioceramics. In a rat model of osteoporotic bone defects, the nwCaP group showed a reduced fracture occurrence and an effective new bone substitution rate, as characterized by micro-CT analysis. The increased bone formation rate and greater amount of new bone formed within the defected area of the nwCaP group was revealed by the serum PINP level and histological staining. Moreover, a gene microarray study indicated that the promotion of osteogenesis might be attributed to selectively upregulated fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) expression in cells co-cultured with the nwCaP bioceramic. Furthermore, the JAK2 signal pathway was confirmed to be involved in the nwCaP-induced elevation of FGF23 expression using primary osteoblasts derived from osteoporotic rats. Collectively, the findings suggested that the micro-/nano-structured bioceramic could enhance osteoporotic bone regeneration and presents a promising strategy for healing bone defects in osteoporosis.",A dynamic DNA nanostructure with switchable and size-selective molecular recognition properties.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30672552,Nanoscale,2019 03 06,"Herein, we report a dynamic DNA nanostructure exhibiting switchable and size-selective molecular recognition properties. A DNA block copolymer, polystyrene-b-DNA (PS-b-DNA), and a thermo-responsive block copolymer, PS-b-poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PS-b-PNIPAM), were simultaneously assembled to form hybrid micelles composed of a PS core and a DNA/PNIPAM corona. PNIPAM strands did not significantly hinder the binding of molecular DNA for a broad range of PNIPAM lengths. On the other hand, they exerted significant steric hindrance for interactions with nanoscale species, which can be reversibly turned off by increasing the temperature above the lower critical solution temperature (LCST) of PNIPAM. Owing to the switchable and size-selective steric hindrance, the hybrid DNA micelles showed thermally controllable enzymatic degradation and cellular uptake. These results demonstrate that the binary self-assembly of two different responsive block copolymers is a promising approach to prepare dynamic nanostructures with controllable biological recognition properties.",Designating ligand specificities to metal uptake ABC transporters in Thermus thermophilus HB8.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30672551,Metallomics : integrated biometal science,2019 03 21,"Micronutrients such as metal ions are indispensable for the growth and survival of microorganisms in assorted environmental niches. However, change in cellular concentration of metal ions is pernicious for an organism; thus metal ion homeostasis is crucial for their survival and growth. An eminent mechanism for maintaining metal ion homeostasis in microorganisms is ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, which transport metal ions in their ionic/complex forms across the cell membrane. For the uptake, metals are sequestered by substrate-binding proteins (SBPs) and transferred to transmembrane domains (TMDs) for their transport. In this work, a high-throughput data mining analysis has been performed to identify open reading frames (ORFs) encoding metal-specific ABC transporters in a thermophilic bacterium Thermus thermophilus HB8. In total, 22 ORFs resulting in eight ABC transport systems were identified, which are potentially involved in the uptake of metal ions. This study suggests that three out of eight metal-specific ABC import systems are specific to iron ions. Among the remaining five, two are particular to divalent metal ions such as Mg2+ and Zn2+/Mn2+, another two are for tetrahedral oxyanions such as MoO42- and WO42- and the remaining one imports cyanocobalamin (vitamin B12). Besides these, the results of this study demonstrate the existence of a mechanism where TMD and NBD components are shared among different ABC transport systems hinting that multiple substrates can be imported via a single transporter. This study thus provides the first ever preliminary glimpse into the entire repertoire of metal uptake ABC transporters in a thermophilic organism.",NMR and MS urinary metabolic phenotyping in kidney diseases is fit-for-purpose in the presence of a protease inhibitor.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30672550,Molecular omics,2019 06 07,"Nephrotic syndrome with idiopathic membranous nephropathy as a major contributor, is characterized by proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia and oedema.

For proteomics, a protease inhibitor (PI) is sometimes added at sample collection to conserve proteins but its impact on urine metabolic phenotyping needs to be evaluated. Urine from controls (n = 4) and idiopathic membranous nephropathy (iMN) patients (n = 6) were collected with and without PI addition and analysed using 1H NMR spectroscopy and UPLC-MS. PI-related data features were observed in the 1H NMR spectra but their removal followed by a median fold change normalisation, eliminated the PI contribution.

Herein, a Cu current collector formed with ultrathin multilayer graphene grown via chemical vapor deposition (CVD) was used as an artificial layer to stabilize the electrode interface and sandwich-deposited Li with Cu. A multilayer graphene film's superior strength, chemical stability, and flexibility make it an excellent choice to modify a Cu electrode. Fabricating an anode bigger than the cathode improved the alignment of the electrodes during assembly, minimizing interfacial stress.

Today, e-nose is a promising approach for the diagnosis of lung cancer. Nevertheless, considerable challenges to early-stage disease diagnostics still remain: e.g. decrease in sensor sensitivities in the presence of water vapor, sensor drift leading to the inability to calibrate exactly, relatively short sensor lifetimes, and difficulty discriminating between multiple diseases. However, there is a wide scope for breath diagnostics techniques, and all advanced electrodes applicable to e-nose devices will benefit them. Here, we present the promising sensing capabilities of bare multi-layer graphene (MLG) as a proof of concept for advanced e-nose devices and demonstrate its utility for biomolecule discrimination of the most common lung CMs (ethanol, isopropanol, and acetone). We report on a comparative study involving exposure of the three CM solutions on flat MLG (f-MLG) and patterned MLG (p-MLG) electrodes, where the electrical conductivity of p-MLG is significantly increased while applying acetone. Based on sensitivity tests, we demonstrate the ability to monitor the electrical response of graphene electrodes employing graphene of various wettabilities. Specifically, the f-MLG electrode displays almost 2 times higher sheet resistance (30 Ω sq-1) compared to the hydrophilic p-MLG (12 Ω sq-1). We show significant sensitivity to selected specific molecules of pristine f-MLG and p-MLG while applying CM solutions with a 1.4 × 105 ppm concentration. Finally, we show the selectivity of f-MLG and p-MLG-based sensors when exposed to 2.0 × 105 ppm solutions containing different CM combinations. Both sensors were selective in particular to acetone, since the presence of acetone leads to a sheet resistance increase. We demonstrate that an advanced e-nose approach integrated with MLG electrodes has significant potential as a design concept for utilization of molecular detection at variable concentrations such as in early-stage disease diagnosis. This early-stage approach will provide convenient and reusable complex monitoring of CMs compared to typical contact sensors which require target analysis and are limited by disposable measuring. Moreover, further integration of the Internet of Things will introduce advanced e-nose devices as a biotechnological innovation for disease resilience with the potential for commercialization.",Differentiation of selectively labeled peptides using solid-state nanopores.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30672547,Nanoscale,2019 03 06,"Determination of the amino acid sequence of a protein is critical for understanding various biological processes. Mass spectrometry has mainly been used for protein identification; however, there are limitations to its sensitivity when detecting low abundance proteins. In this study, we attempted to distinguish between three similar peptide sequences (∼40 amino acids, ∼5 kDa) that differed only by the location or number of cysteine residues with solid-state nanopores. The cysteine residues are located at one end, one at the center, and at both ends for each of the three peptides. We found that differentiation of the three types of peptides by nanopore signals was difficult. However, when the cysteine residue was labeled with a negatively charged molecule, Flamma® 496, the labeled peptides showed distinct signals for each peptide. Comparing the relative current blockades of labeled peptides with applied voltages, we found that the label was able to change peptide conformations and the resulting ionic current signals from the three labeled peptides were distinguished based on the relative current blockade, full width at half-maximum of the current blockade distribution, and single-molecule level peak shape analysis. Our results suggest that solid-state nanopores combined with a targeted labeling strategy could be used to obtain characteristic peptide signatures that could ultimately be used for protein identification.",Curvature-driven adsorption of cationic nanoparticles to phase boundaries in multicomponent lipid bilayers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30672546,Nanoscale,2019 02 15,"Understanding the interactions between surface-functionalized gold nanoparticles (NPs) and lipid bilayers is necessary to guide the design of NPs for biomedical applications. Recent experiments found that cationic NPs adsorb more strongly to phase-separated multicomponent lipid bilayers than single-component liquid-disordered bilayers, suggesting that phase separation affects NP-bilayer interactions. In this work, we use coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the effect of lipid phase behavior on the adsorption of small cationic NPs. We first determined the free energy change for adsorbing a NP to one-phase liquid-disordered and one-phase liquid-ordered bilayers. The simulations indicate that NP adsorption depends on a competition between favorable NP-lipid interactions and the unfavorable curvature deformation of the bilayer, resulting in stronger interactions with the liquid-disordered bilayer due to its lower bending modulus. We then measured the free energy change associated with moving a NP across the surface of a phase-separated bilayer and identified a free energy minimum at the phase boundary. The free energy minimum is attributed to the thickness gradient between the two phases that enables favorable NP-lipid interactions without necessitating large curvature deformations. The simulation results thus indicate that the intrinsic curvature present at phase boundaries drives preferential interactions with surface-adsorbed NPs, providing new insight into the forces that drive NP behavior at multicomponent, phase-separated lipid bilayers.",Fibrinogen-erythrocyte binding and hemorheology measurements in the assessment of essential arterial hypertension patients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30672545,Nanoscale,2019 03 04,"Some studies have reported a positive association between plasma fibrinogen levels, erythrocyte aggregation and essential arterial hypertension (EAH). The aim of this study was to understand how the interaction between fibrinogen and its erythrocyte membrane receptor is altered in EAH. EAH patients (n = 31) and healthy blood donors (n = 65) were enrolled in the study. EAH patients were therapeutically controlled for the disease, presenting a systolic blood pressure between 108 and 180 mmHg and a diastolic blood pressure between 66 and 123 mmHg. Clinical evaluation included blood pressure monitoring, electrocardiography, echocardiography and blood cell count. The hemorheological parameters were also analyzed. Fibrinogen-erythrocyte binding force and frequency were evaluated quantitatively, at the single-molecule level, using atomic force microscopy (AFM). Changes in erythrocyte elasticity were also evaluated. Force spectroscopy data showed that the average fibrinogen-erythrocyte binding forces increase from 40.4 ± 3.0 pN in healthy donors to 73.8 ± 8.1 pN in patients with EAH, despite a lower binding frequency for patients compared to the control group (7.9 ± 1.6% vs. 27.6 ± 4.2%, respectively). Elasticity studies revealed an increase of erythrocyte stiffness in the patients. The stronger fibrinogen binding to erythrocytes from EAH patients and alteration in cell elasticity may lead to changes in the whole blood flow. The patients' altered hemorheological parameters may also contribute to these blood flow perturbations. The transient bridging of two erythrocytes, by the simultaneous binding of fibrinogen to both of them, promoting erythrocyte aggregation, could represent an important cardiovascular risk factor.",Cisplatin reacts with histone H1 and the adduct forms a ternary complex with DNA.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30672544,Metallomics : integrated biometal science,2019 03 21,"Cisplatin is an anticancer drug widely used in clinics; it induces the apoptosis of cancer cells by targeting DNA. However, its interaction with proteins has been found to be crucial in modulating the pre and post-target activity. Nuclear DNA is tightly assembled with histone proteins to form nucleosomes in chromatin; this can impede the drug to access DNA. On the other hand, the linker histone H1 is considered 'the gate to nucleosomal DNA' due to its exposed location and dynamic conformation; therefore, this protein can influence the platination of DNA. In this study, we performed a reaction of cisplatin with histone H1 and investigated the interaction of the H1/cisplatin adduct with DNA. The reactions were conducted on the N-terminal domains of H1.4 (sequence 1-90, H1N90) and H1.0 (sequence 1-7, H1N7). The results show that H1 readily reacts with cisplatin and generates bidentate and tridentate adducts, with methionine and glutamate residues as the preferential binding sites. Chromatographic and NMR analyses show that the platination rate of H1 is slightly higher than that of DNA and the platinated H1 can form H1-cisplatin-DNA ternary complexes. Interestingly, cisplatin is more prone to form H1-Pt-DNA ternary complexes than trans-oriented platinum agents. The formation of H1-cisplatin-DNA ternary complexes and their preference for cis- over trans-oriented platinum agents suggest an important role of histone H1 in the mechanism of action of cisplatin."

In the present work, the charge transport properties of three series of quinoidal thiophene derivatives, oligothiophene (series A), thienothiophene (series B) and benzothiophene (series C), are systematically investigated by employing full quantum charge transfer theory combined with kinetic Monte-Carlo simulation. The single crystal structures of the molecules we had constructed were predicted using the USPEX program combined with density functional theory (DFT) and considering the dispersion corrected. Our theoretical results expounded how the different connection styles, including oligo-, thieno-, and benzo-thiophene in the quinoidal thiophenes derivatives, effectively tune their electronic structures, and revealed how their intermolecular interactions affect the molecular packing patterns and hence their charge transport properties by symmetry-adapted perturbation theory (SAPT). In the meantime we also elucidated the role of end-cyano groups in noncovalent interactions. Furthermore, it is clarified that quinoidal thiophene derivatives show excellent carrier transport properties due to their optimal molecular stacking motifs and larger electronic couplings besides their low energy gap. In addition, our theoretical results demonstrate that quinoidal oligothiophene derivatives (n = 3-5) with more thiophene rings will have ambipolar transport properties, so quinoidal thienothiophene and benzothiophene derivatives should be promising alternatives as n-type OSCs. When we focused only on the electronic transport properties in the three series of molecules, quinoidal benzothiophene derivatives were slightly better than quinoidal oligothiophene or thienothiophene derivatives.",Effect of surface-bulk partitioning on the heterogeneous oxidation of aqueous saccharide aerosols.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30672531,Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP,2019 02 15,"The OH-initiated heterogeneous oxidation of mixed saccharide aqueous aerosols is investigated using an atmospheric-pressure flow tube coupled to off-line analysis of the particle composition. For equimolar monosaccharide/disaccharide aqueous aerosol mixtures, the decay of the disaccharide is found to be significantly slower than that of the monosaccharide. Molecular dynamics simulations of the mixed aqueous solutions reveal the formation of a ∼10 Å disaccharide exclusion layer below the water surface. A simple chemical model is developed to discuss the possible effect of the disaccharide surface partitioning on the heterogeneous kinetics. The observed decays are consistent with a poor spatial overlap of the OH radical at the interface with the disaccharide in the particle bulk. The effect of partitioning on the heterogeneous oxidation of atmospheric organic aerosols is discussed.",When hydrogen bonding overcomes Coulomb repulsion: from kinetic to thermodynamic stability of cationic dimers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30672530,Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP,2019 04 18,"Quantum chemical calculations have been employed to study the kinetic and thermodynamic stability of hydroxy-functionalized 1-(3-hydroxyalkyl)pyridinium cationic dimers. For [Py-(CH2)n-OH+]2 structures with n = 2-17 we have calculated the robust local minima with clear dissociation barriers preventing their ""Coulomb explosion"" into separated cations. For n = 15 hydrogen bonding and dispersion forces fully compensate for the repulsive Coulomb forces between the cations allowing for the quantification of the pure hydrogen bond in the order of 20 kJ mol-1. The increasing kinetic stability even turns to thermodynamic stability with further elongated hydroxyalkyl chains. Now, quantum-type short-range attraction wins over classical long-range electrostatic repulsion resulting in negative binding energies and providing the first thermodynamically stable cationic dimers. The electronic, structural and spectroscopic signatures of the cationic dimers could be correlated to NBO parameters, supporting the existence of anti-electrostatic hydrogen bonds (AEHB) as recently suggested by Weinhold. In principle, these pure cationic dimers should be detectable in gas-phase experiments at low temperatures without the need of mediating molecules or counteranions.",Unraveling the effect of B-site antisite defects on the electronic and magnetic properties of the quadruple perovskite CaCu3Fe2Nb2O12.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30672529,Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP,2019 02 15,"The atomic-scale degree of B/B' alternate cationic disorder is known to significantly influence the macroscopic properties of the quadruple perovskites AA3'B2B2'O12; however, the nature of this disorder has rarely been critically studied. Herein, the effect of B-site cationic arrangement on the electronic and magnetic properties of the quadruple perovskite CaCu3Fe2Nb2O12 was systemically investigated using the first-principles calculations. The results demonstrate that the B-site ordered CaCu3Fe2Nb2O12 is a ferrimagnetic insulator with antiferromagnetic coupling between the A'-site Cu and B-site Fe. The calculated total magnetic moment is 7.00 μB f.u.-1, which is apparently larger than the experimentally measured saturation magnetization because of different degrees of the B-site disorder. Furthermore, the electronic structures illustrate that the magnetic moments sharply decrease with an increase in the B-site antisite defects, i.e., the total magnetic moments obviously reduce with an increase in the B-site Fe/Nb disorder, and ultimately, no magnetism is observed. Interestingly, the B-site antisite defects not only introduce Fe-Fe antiferromagnetic coupling, but also induce the antiferromagnetic arrangement of Cu spins in the totally disordered structure. Cu-Fe and Fe-Fe magnetic coupling competition is coupled with antisite defects, and finally, Fe-Fe antiferromagnetic coupling turns into the dominating spin coupling in the disordered CaCu3Fe2Nb2O12. Moreover, the B-site antisite defects do not alter the insulator nature of the perovskite despite the significantly narrowed band gap. Our study opens up a novel avenue for the straightforward understanding of the effect of cationic ordering on the electronic and magnetic properties of quadruple perovskites and offers an additional opportunity for tailoring their characteristics.",Screened hybrid meta-GGA exchange-correlation functionals for extended systems.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30672528,Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP,2019 02 15,"Screened Hartree-Fock exchange integrated with semilocal exchange-correlation functionals often proficiently predict several solid-state properties. This is due to the inclusion of the desired non-locality within the density functional approximations. The screened Hartree-Fock is included within the semilocal functional to compensate the short-range semilocal part which is subtracted from the base semilocal functional. The central task for constructing the screened exchange-correlation functional is to design the short-range semilocal functional. In designing the screened hybrid functionals the exchange hole plays the prime role. In this work, we propose a meta-generalized gradient approximation (meta-GGA) level screened hybrid functional based on the local density approximation based exchange hole and the Tao-Mo semilocal functional. We extensively make an assessment of the newly proposed functional for several solid-state properties which include lattice constants, bulk moduli, band gaps, and cohesive energies. A comparison of the results for the present functional to those for the GGA-based hybrid functional HSE06 confirms that several solid-state properties can be substantially improved by going beyond the GGA level.",The structural determination and skeletal ring modes of tetrahydropyran.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30672522,Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP,2019 02 15,"A high-resolution molecular spectroscopy study was carried out on the cyclic ether tetrahydropyran (THP), one of the smallest molecules composed of a pyranose ring. As this ring structure is closely related to carbohydrates, THP can offer relevant insight into structural variations of this unit. Thus, an extensive probe of THP using three broadband instruments ranging from the microwave to the far-infrared (2-8 GHz, 75-110 GHz and 100-650 cm-1 frequency ranges) was performed to accrue both accurate sets of rotational constants and structural information. This array of experimental setups provided an accurate set of data to improve the description of the ground state of THP and revise the principal parameters of its backbone structure. The structural information was deduced from the assignment of the 13C and 18O isotopologues present in natural abundance. In addition, the complementary dataset obtained from these experiments led to a better characterization of the vibrational motions involving the skeletal ring of the molecule. In particular, the vibrational frequencies of four of these modes (ν23 (∼250 cm-1), ν22 (∼403 cm-1), ν21 (∼430 cm-1), and ν20 (∼562 cm-1)) have been determined from the analysis of the first rotationally resolved vibrational spectrum reported for THP.

Although enzyme-instructed self-assembly (EISA) has provided a promising approach for selective cancer therapy, the application of EISA is still suffering from requiring much higher concentrations for inhibiting cancer cells. Therefore, new strategies are needed to maximize the anticancer efficacy and preserve the selectivity of EISA. In this study, we rationally designed and synthesised a novel peptide-based prodrug molecule, NapGDFDFpYSV, combining EISA with the YSV anticancer peptide. The activity of the prodrug molecule was remarkably reduced by masking ""Y"" with a phosphoryl (-PO3) group and was recovered through dephosphorylation in situ by alkaline phosphatase (ALP) catalysis. The resulting monomer, NapGDFDFYSV, as a hydrogelator further self-assembled into the nanodrug on the cell surface, resulting in enhanced cellular uptake and selective high cytotoxicity to cells overexpressing ALP via action on histone deacetylase. Moreover, the required cell inhibition concentration of NapGDFDFpYSV was much lower than its critical micelle concentration (CMC), exhibiting outstanding advantages compared with separately used EISA without the anticancer peptide. Our study provides a new strategy to improve the cytotoxicity selectivity and bioactivity of chemotherapy drugs as well as the anticancer efficiency of EISA.","A label-free, ultra-highly sensitive and multiplexed SERS nanoplasmonic biosensor for miRNA detection using a head-flocked gold nanopillar.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30672519,The Analyst,2019 06 13,"Cell-free micro-ribonucleic acids (cf-miRNAs) regulate most human genes by controlling the mRNA translation and have been considered as the most promising biomarkers for cancer diagnosis and prognosis.

Herein, we develop a label-free, ultra-high sensitivity and selectivity multiplex miRNA using surface-enhanced Raman scattering to detect cancer-associated miRNAs with head-flocked gold nanopillars as a substrate. Using a complementary DNA probe platform and an ultra-high sensitivity SERS based biosensor, we achieved high selectivity in targeting miRNAs with extremely low detection limits, without any chemical or enzymatic reactions and evaluated the correlation between the miRNA expression level and the Raman signal intensity. A reproducible SERS signal is monitored via uniformly fabricated elastic head-flocked gold nanopillars through a mapping method. This system supports the detection of cell-free miRNAs in blood, which are utilized and quantified as biomarkers to diagnose and provide a prognosis for cancers and intractable diseases.

We found that miR-494 was significantly down-regulated in gastric cancer cells lines compared to the normal gastric epithelial cell line. Exogenous overexpression of miR-494 increased the chemosensitivity of gastric cancer cells to doxorubicin. Moreover, miR-494 expression was reduced in a doxorubicin-resistant gastric cancer cells (AGS/dox) compared with the parental cells. MTT assay showed that AGS/dox cells exhibited an elevated viability compared with the parental cells. Enforced expression of miR-494 inhibited AGS/dox cell viability and colony formation ability. In addition, we demonstrated that elevated expression of miR-494 inhibited the mRNA and protein expression of phosphodiesterases 4D (PDE4D) in gastric cancer cell. Luciferase assay showed that miR-494 directly targeted the 3'UTR region of PDE4D. Furthermore, restoration of PDE4D recovered the chemoresistance in miR-494-overexpressed gastric cancer cells. Taken together, this study demonstrated that miR-494 enhanced doxorubicin sensitivity via regulation of PDE4D expression, suggesting a novel therapeutic strategy for anti-chemoresistance in gastric cancer.",Ailanthone reverses multidrug resistance by inhibiting the P-glycoprotein-mediated efflux in resistant K562/A02 cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30672437,"Cellular and molecular biology (Noisy-le-Grand, France)",2019 05 17,"Multidrug resistance (MDR) poses a great impediment to cancer treatment. Excessive expression of ATP-binding cassette transport protein AC-1 (P-glycoprotein, P-GLP) is usually involved in MDR. In this study, ailanthone (AIL), a natural compound extracted from the whole seedlings of Ailanthus altissima (Simaroubaceae) was shown to mediate the reversal of P-GLP-induced MDR and restore the susceptibility of K562/A02 cells to doxorubicin (DOX). Further mechanistic studies revealed that AIL increased intracellular DOX accumulation and interrupted Rh123 efflux through suppression of P-GLP, and also suppressed P-GLP ATPase activity. At the same time, it markedly inhibited MDR1 gene expression and P-GLP protein to sensitize the cytotoxic effect of DOX. Furthermore, AIL down-regulated P-GLP expression by inhibiting the PI3K/Akt pathway. Thus, AIL could be a potential therapeutic compound for reversing P-GLP-mediated drug resistant cancer.",Expression of cardiac inwardly rectifying potassium channels in pentylenetetrazole kindling model of epilepsy in rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30672436,"Cellular and molecular biology (Noisy-le-Grand, France)",2019 05 17,"Clinical and experimental studies show that epilepsy affects cardiac function; however, the underlying molecular mechanism has not been fully elucidated. Inwardly-rectifying potassium (Kir) channels transport K+ ions into excitable cells such as neurons and cardiomyocytes; they control the cell excitability by acting towards the repolarization phase of cardiac action potential. Kir channel expression has been previously shown to vary in epileptic brains, at the same time seizures are known to affect the autonomic nervous system. Kir channel expression in cardiac tissue is a possible mechanism for the explanation of cardiac pathology in epilepsy. We investigate the expression of Kir channels in epileptic cardiac tissue by using pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-kindling model in rats. Our molecular analyses showed significant decrease in cardiac Kir channel mRNA and protein expression of PTZ-kindled rats. Interestingly, both Kir2.x, which directs IK1 flux in ventricular tissue and Kir3.x, which is responsible for IKACh in the atria, were observed to decrease significantly. Kir channel expression also differs between females and males. This is the first study to our knowledge in epileptic cardiac tissue showing the expression of Kir channels. Our results show that Kir channels may play a role in cardiac pathology associated with epilepsy.",Neuronal survival of DRG neurons after neurite transection in vitro promotes by nerve growth factor and brain derived neurotrophic factor.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30672435,"Cellular and molecular biology (Noisy-le-Grand, France)",2019 05 17,"Neurotrophic factors are growth factors that promote neuronal survival, regulate synaptic function and neurotransmitter release, and promote the plasticity and growth of axons in the peripheral and central nervous systems. This study focused on the roles of nerve growth factor (NGF) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the survival of adult dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons following axotomy. To investigate this, we cultured adult mouse DRG neurons and administered NGF or BDNF to the culture medium at different doses before transection. After determining the optimal doses of NGF and BDNF, these factors were then applied in combination. Axotomy was performed using a precise laser beam and neuronal death was visualized through cell observer microscopy system, by adding propidium iodide to the culture medium. The results demonstrate that the optimal doses of NGF and BDNF for neuronal survival are 150 ng/mL and 50 ng/mL, respectively. The highest level of neuronal survival was observed in the cells treated with a combination of NGF and BDNF. In conclusion, NGF and BDNF have a positive effect, both individually and in combination, on the survival of DRG neurons following neurite transection."

The objective is to determine the effectiveness of using perfusion characteristics to identify and discriminate between regions of liver that contain malignant tissues from normal tissue. Each patient contributes multiple regions of interest which are spatially correlated due to the shared vasculature. We propose a multivariate functional data model to disclose the correlation over time and space as well as the correlation among multiple perfusion characteristics. We further propose a simultaneous classification approach that utilizes all the correlation information to predict class assignments for collections of regions. The proposed method outperforms conventional classification approaches in the presence of strong spatial correlation.

We have previously shown that low-voltage-activated calcium channels, or T-type channels (T-channels), increase excitability of sensory neurons after surgical incision in rats. We have also found that endogenous 5β-reduced neuroactive steroid epipregnanolone [(3β,5β)-3-hydroxypregnan-20-one] blocked isolated T-currents in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) cells in vitro, and reduced nociceptive behavior in vivo, after local intraplantar application into the foot pads of heathy rats and mice. Here, we investigated if epipregnanolone exerts an antinociceptive effect after intrathecal (i.t.) application in healthy rats, as well as an antihyperalgesic effect in a postsurgical pain model. We also studied if this endogenous neurosteroid blocks currents originating from high voltage-activated (HVA) calcium channels in rat sensory neurons. In in vivo studies, we found that epipregnanolone alleviated thermal and mechanical nociception in healthy rats after i.t. administration without affecting their sensory-motor abilities. Furthermore, epipregnanolone effectively reduced mechanical hyperalgesia after i.t application in rats after surgery. In subsequent in vitro studies, we found that epipregnanolone blocked isolated HVA currents in nociceptive sensory neurons with an IC50 of 3.3 μM in a G-protein-dependent fashion.

Recent studies have established an essential role for an enhanced transient receptor potential vanilloid subtype 1 (TRPV1) signaling in mediating peripheral hyperalgesia in inflammatory conditions. Since colocalization of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and TRPV1 has been observed in primary afferents including the trigeminal sensory neurons and the dorsal root ganglion neurons, we test the hypothesis that TLR4 might regulate the expression and function of TRPV1 in primary afferent neurons in 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfate (TNBS)-induced colitis using the TLR4-deficient and the wild-type C57 mice. Despite having a higher disease activity index following administration of 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfate, the TLR4-deficient mice showed less inflammatory infiltration in the colon than the wild-type mice. Increased expression of TLR4 and TRPV1 as well as increased density of capsaicin-induced TRPV1 current was observed in L4-S2 dorsal root ganglion neurons of the wild-type colitis mice till two weeks post 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfate treatment. In comparison, the TLR4-deficient colitis mice had lower TRPV1 expression and TRPV1 current density in dorsal root ganglion neurons with lower abdominal withdrawal response scores during noxious colonic distensions. In the wild type but not in the TLR4-deficient dorsal root ganglion neurons, acute administration of the TLR4 agonist lipopolysaccharide increased the capsaicin-evoked TRPV1 current. In addition, we found that the canonical signaling downstream of TLR4 was activated in 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfate-induced colitis in the wild type but not in the TLR4-deficient mice. These results indicate that TLR4 may play a major role in regulation of TRPV1 signaling and peripheral hyperalgesia in inflammatory conditions.",Post-Traumatic Stress Symptoms after Pediatric Injury: Relation to Pre-Frontal Limbic Circuitry.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30672379,Journal of neurotrauma,2019 06 16,"Pre-frontal limbic circuitry is vulnerable to effects of stress and injury. We examined microstructure of pre-frontal limbic circuitry after traumatic brain injury (TBI) or extracranial injury (EI) and its relation to post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS). Participants aged 8 to 15 years who sustained mild to severe TBI (n = 53) or EI (n = 26) in motor vehicle incidents were compared with healthy children (n = 38) in a prospective longitudinal study. At the seven-week follow-up, diffusion tensor imaging was obtained in all groups; injured children completed PTSS ratings using a validated scale. Using probabilistic diffusion tensor tractography, pathways were seeded from bilateral amygdalae and hippocampi to estimate the trajectory of white matter connecting them to each other and to targeted pre-frontal cortical (PFC) regions. Microstructure was estimated using fractional anisotropy (FA) in white matter and mean diffusivity (MD) in gray matter. Pre-frontal limbic microstructure was similar across groups, except for reduced FA in the right hippocampus to orbital PFC pathway in the injured versus healthy group. We examined microstructure of components of pre-frontal limbic circuitry with concurrently obtained PTSS cluster scores in the injured children. Neither microstructure nor PTSS scores differed significantly in the TBI and EI groups. Across PTSS factors, specific symptom clusters were related positively to higher FA and MD. Higher hyperarousal, avoidance, and re-experiencing symptoms were associated with higher FA in amygdala to pre-frontal and hippocampus to amygdala pathways. Higher hippocampal MD had a central role in hyperarousal and emotional numbing symptoms. Age moderated the relation of white and gray matter microstructure with hyperarousal scores. Our findings are consistent with models of traumatic stress that implicate disrupted top-down PFC and hippocampal moderation of overreactive subcortical threat arousal systems. Alterations in limbic pre-frontal circuitry and PTSS place children with either brain or body injuries at elevated risk for both current and future psychological health problems.",Body Composition and S-Klotho Plasma Levels in Middle-Aged Adults: A Cross-Sectional Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30672377,Rejuvenation research,2019 03 01,"The α-Klotho gene was identified as a possible ""aging-suppressor"" agent that extends life span when overexpressed.

A total of 74 (39 women) middle-aged sedentary adults (53.7 ± 5.1 years old; 75.7 ± 14.0 kg; 167.8 ± 9.8 cm) participated in the study. We measured weight and height, and we used dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry to measure fat mass and lean mass. We calculated the body mass index (BMI), fat mass index (FMI), and lean mass index (LMI). The S-Klotho plasma levels were measured in the ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid plasma using a solid-phase sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. There was a strong positive association between LMI and S-Klotho plasma levels (β = 74.794, R2 = 0.346, p < 0.001), which persisted after controlling for age and gender as well as after additionally controlling for FMI.

Participants also completed non-social trials in which they responded to an arrow cue within the same task context. While patients and controls took equivalent time to process communicative intent from gaze shifts, patients made significantly more errors than controls when responding to the directional information conveyed by gaze, but not arrow, cues. Despite no differences in response times to gaze cues between groups, patients were significantly slower than controls when responding to arrow cues. This is the opposite pattern of results previously observed in autistic adults using the same task and suggests that, despite general impairments in attention orienting or oculomotor control, patients with schizophrenia demonstrate a facilitation effect when responding to communicative gaze cues. Findings indicate a hyper-responsivity to gaze cues of communicative intent in schizophrenia. The possible effects of self-referential biases when evaluating gaze direction are discussed, as are clinical implications.",Mutagenesis of Snu114 domain IV identifies a developmental role in meiotic splicing.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30672374,RNA biology,2019 04 11,"Snu114, a component of the U5 snRNP, plays a key role in activation of the spliceosome. It controls the action of Brr2, an RNA-stimulated ATPase/RNA helicase that disrupts U4/U6 snRNA base-pairing prior to formation of the spliceosome's catalytic centre. Snu114 has a highly conserved domain structure that resembles that of the GTPase EF-2/EF-G in the ribosome. It has been suggested that the regulatory function of Snu114 in activation of the spliceosome is mediated by its C-terminal region, however, there has been only limited characterisation of the interactions of the C-terminal domains. We show a direct interaction between protein phosphatase PP1 and Snu114 domain 'IVa' and identify sequence 'YGVQYK' as a PP1 binding motif. Interestingly, this motif is also required for Cwc21 binding. We provide evidence for mutually exclusive interaction of Cwc21 and PP1 with Snu114 and show that the affinity of Cwc21 and PP1 for Snu114 is influenced by the different nucleotide-bound states of Snu114. Moreover, we identify a novel mutation in domain IVa that, while not affecting vegetative growth of yeast cells, causes a defect in splicing transcripts of the meiotic genes, SPO22, AMA1 and MER2, thereby inhibiting an early stage of meiosis.",Comparison of venous thromboembolism risk stratification models in a high risk otolaryngology patient cohort.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30672371,Journal of perioperative practice,2019 04 25,"Our objective was to compare the venous thromboembolism outcomes in two of the most commonly utilised venous thromboembolism assessment tools, the Caprini system and the University of Michigan system, in a high risk head and neck surgery population. Currently, there is a lack of data reporting the validation of well known scoring systems in this patient population. Established risk factors for venous thromboembolism were included in the data collection process. We retrospectively evaluated all patients with the Caprini Risk Assessment and the University of Michigan Health System (UMHS) Scores. Out of all the risk factors, only length of surgery was found to be associated with venous thromboembolism. The mean Caprini scores in those with and without venous thromboembolism were 8.00 ± 3.00 and 6.86 ± 1.45, respectively. The mean UMHS scores in those with and without venous thromboembolism were 6.85 ± 1.28 and 6.54 ± 1.20, respectively. Both scoring systems were not found to be associated with venous thromboembolism.",Bisperoxovanadium Mediates Neuronal Protection through Inhibition of PTEN and Activation of PI3K/AKT-mTOR Signaling after Traumatic Spinal Injuries.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30672370,Journal of neurotrauma,2019 03 28,"Although mechanisms involved in progression of cell death in spinal cord injury (SCI) have been studied extensively, few are clear targets for translation to clinical application. One of the best-understood mechanisms of cell survival in SCI is phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt and associated downstream signaling. Clear therapeutic efficacy of a phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) inhibitor called bisperoxovanadium (bpV) has been shown in SCI, traumatic brain injury, stroke, and other neurological disease models in both neuroprotection and functional recovery. The present study aimed to elucidate mechanistic influences of bpV activity in neuronal survival in in vitro and in vivo models of SCI. Treatment with 100 nM bpV(pic) reduced cell death in a primary spinal neuron injury model (p < 0.05) in vitro, and upregulated both Akt and ribosomal protein S6 (pS6) activity (p < 0.05) compared with non-treated injured neurons. Pre-treatment of spinal neurons with a PI3K inhibitor, LY294002 or mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor, rapamycin blocked bpV activation of Akt and ribosomal protein S6 activity, respectively. Treatment with bpV increased extracellular signal-related kinase (Erk) activity after scratch injury in vitro, and rapamycin reduced influence by bpV on Erk phosphorylation. After a cervical hemicontusive SCI, Akt phosphorylation decreased in total tissue via Western blot analysis (p < 0.01) as well as in penumbral ventral horn motor neurons throughout the first week post-injury (p < 0.05). Conversely, PTEN activity appeared to increase over this period. As observed in vitro, bpV also increased Erk activity post-SCI (p < 0.05). Our results suggest that PI3K/Akt signaling is the likely primary mechanism of bpV action in mediating neuroprotection in injured spinal neurons.",The Role of Voltage-Gated Sodium Channels in Pain Signaling.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30672368,Physiological reviews,2019 02 26,"Acute pain signaling has a key protective role and is highly evolutionarily conserved. Chronic pain, however, is maladaptive, occurring as a consequence of injury and disease, and is associated with sensitization of the somatosensory nervous system. Primary sensory neurons are involved in both of these processes, and the recent advances in understanding sensory transduction and human genetics are the focus of this review. Voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs) are important determinants of sensory neuron excitability: they are essential for the initial transduction of sensory stimuli, the electrogenesis of the action potential, and neurotransmitter release from sensory neuron terminals. Nav1.1, Nav1.6, Nav1.7, Nav1.8, and Nav1.9 are all expressed by adult sensory neurons. The biophysical characteristics of these channels, as well as their unique expression patterns within subtypes of sensory neurons, define their functional role in pain signaling. Changes in the expression of VGSCs, as well as posttranslational modifications, contribute to the sensitization of sensory neurons in chronic pain states. Furthermore, gene variants in Nav1.7, Nav1.8, and Nav1.9 have now been linked to human Mendelian pain disorders and more recently to common pain disorders such as small-fiber neuropathy. Chronic pain affects one in five of the general population. Given the poor efficacy of current analgesics, the selective expression of particular VGSCs in sensory neurons makes these attractive targets for drug discovery. The increasing availability of gene sequencing, combined with structural modeling and electrophysiological analysis of gene variants, also provides the opportunity to better target existing therapies in a personalized manner."

To improve cancer prognosis and survival rates, a better understanding of multi-level contributory factors associated with cancer survival is needed. However, prior research on cancer survival has primarily focused on factors from the individual level due to limited availability of integrated datasets. In this study, we sought to examine how data integration impacts the performance of cancer survival prediction models. We linked data from four different sources and evaluated the performance of Cox proportional hazard models for breast, lung, and colorectal cancers under three common data integration scenarios. We showed that adding additional contextual-level predictors to survival models through linking multiple datasets improved model fit and performance. We also showed that different representations of the same variable or concept have differential impacts on model performance. When building statistical models for cancer outcomes, it is important to consider cross-level predictor interactions.",Current and emerging biologic and small molecule therapies for atopic dermatitis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30672355,Expert opinion on biological therapy,2019 03 22,"Atopic dermatitis (AD) is the most common inflammatory skin disease, yet until recently there were no safe systemic therapies approved for the long-term management of AD in adult patients. A deeper understanding of disease pathogenesis and identification of molecular and cellular changes has resulted in a rapidly evolving pipeline of therapeutics that holds promise for safer long-term control. Areas covered: In this review, we highlight the growing arsenal of biologic and small molecule antagonists that target pathways implicated in AD pathogenesis. Evidence that AD is driven by multiple immune axes extending beyond the Th2 polarization has resulted in therapies targeting additional pathways, including the Th22, Th17/IL-23, and JAK-STAT pathways. Pruritus, a hallmark of AD, has been linked to multiple mechanisms and various therapeutics have emerged in response to alternative hypotheses. Expert opinion: Despite the assumption that AD has a common disease mechanism, recent studies indicate that the disorder is characterized by several phenotypes and therapy may need to be tailored to the unique immune traits of specific phenotypes. Targeted therapy should complement and expand our molecular map of AD across the various phenotypic iterations and help push AD pharmacotherapy into a new era of personalized medicine.",Antibiotic stewardship in sepsis management: toward a balanced use of antibiotics for the severely ill patient.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30672354,Expert review of anti-infective therapy,2019 05 02,"Severe infections in critically ill patients carry a high morbidity and mortality rate. Given the impact of early and broad-spectrum empirical therapy in several studies and the emphasis on this in international guidelines, there is a low threshold for initiating antibiotics in many patients with suspected infection. This has led to the widespread use of antibiotics in critically ill patients, which is often unnecessary or inappropriate. Areas covered: Antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) attempts to reduce antibiotic exposure while improving outcomes and may intuitively contrast with current antibiotic prescription practices. The challenge for critical care physicians is thus to correctly diagnose infection and improve outcome while reducing antibiotic use. This can be done by adhering to local guidelines for empirical therapy, better risk for multidrug resistance assessment, optimized antibiotic dosing, and integration of rapid diagnostic techniques in the decision-making process. Watchful waiting, or withholding antibiotics until infection is confirmed, is justified in non-severely ill patients in whom the clinical picture is not clear. Expert opinion: Integrating AMS strategies in clinical practice can help upholding the best antibiotic empirical therapy while reducing antibiotic consumption. AMS is a multidisciplinary policy and should be embraced by critical care physicians as a solution for balanced antibiotic use.",Advances in curcumin-loaded nanopreparations: improving bioavailability and overcoming inherent drawbacks.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30672353,Journal of drug targeting,2019 02 06,"Curcumin (CUR), one of the major extracts of turmeric, has gained extensive attention owing to its extraordinary benefits as anti-cancer, anti-bacterial, anti-ulcerative, anti-depressant, anti-inflammatory and wound healing agent. However, a major barrier in its application lies in its inherent nature of low water solubility, instability, and short half-life. Different strategies have been adopted to overcome these barriers like preparing nano-sized formulations and exploiting stable and hydrophilic derivatives, and collaborative drug delivery. Nanopreparations could maintain the pharmacological effect of drugs, even the holistic effects of drug extracts. In addition, nanopreparations based on novel materials make it a reality to regulate the drug release rate according to the various environmental conditions. The therapeutic applications and novel investigated nanopreparations of CUR for prevention and treatment of various diseases, especially, cancer and inflammatory disorders are discussed in this review.",Quality of Life and Depression in Turkish Patients with β-Thalassemia Major: A Cross-Sectional Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30672351,Hemoglobin,2019 05 14,"Thalassemias are the most common monogenic disorders worldwide. Thalassemia patients experience difficulties in their schooling, finding jobs and/or marriage because of functional and physical limitations caused by this disease. It is expected that the quality of life (QoL) of patients with thalassemia will be lower than those without this disease. The aim of this study was to benefit worldwide thalassemia patients in terms of QoL and mental health. This cross-sectional study was performed in Turkey. The study population consisted of of 57 β-thalassemia major (β-TM) patients and the control group. The short form-36 (SF-36) questionnaire and Beck depression inventory (BDI) were used. The mean age of the patients was 21.6 ± 6.6 (age range 15-39) and the male-to-female ratio was 0.7. The mean SF-36 scores of the patient and the control groups were 59.2 ± 12.4 and 75.7 ± 11.8, and the mean BDI scores of the patients and controls were 13.5 ± 6.4 and 6.1 ± 3.7, respectively. There was a statistically significant difference between the total SF-36 and BDI scores of patients and controls. We aimed to investigate the effects of the decrease in morbidity and mortality of β-thalassemia (β-thal) due to regular transfusions and chelation therapy on the QoL and mental health of patients. The β-TM patients have a comparatively worse QoL score than the normal population.

The primal focus of this study was to prepare chitosan-glycerol phosphate thermosensitive hydrogel formed in-situ and loaded with risedronate (bone resorption inhibitor) in an easy way with no requirement of complicated processes or large number of equipment. Then we investigated its effectiveness for bone regeneration. In-situ forming hydrogels were prepared using chitosan cross-linked with glycerol phosphate and loaded with risedronate and nano-hydroxyapatite as bone cement. The prepared hydrogels were characterized by analyzing their gelation time at 37 °C, % porosity, swelling index, in-vitro degradation, rheological properties, and in-vitro drug release. Results showed that the in-situ hydrogels prepared using 2.5% (w/v) chitosan cross-linked with 50% (w/v) glycerol phosphate in the ratio (9:1, v/v) reinforced with 20 mg/mL and nano-hydroxyapatite possessed the most sustained drug release profile. This optimized formulation was further evaluated using DSC and FTIR studies, in addition to their morphological properties using scanning electron microscopy. The effect on Saos-2 cell line viability was evaluated also using MTT assay on the optimized hydrogel formulation in addition to their action on cell proliferation using fluorescence microscope. Moreover, calcium deposition on the hydrogel and alkaline phosphatase activity were evaluated. Risedronate-nano-hydroxyapatite loaded hydrogels significantly enhanced the Saos-2 cell proliferation in addition to enhanced alkaline phosphatase activity and calcium deposition. Such results suggest that risedronate-nano-hydroxyapatite loaded hydrogels present great biocompatibility for bone regeneration. Proliferation of cells, as well as deposition of mineral on the hydrogel, was an evidence of the biocompatible nature of the hydrogel.

They are essential components of complex regulatory networks that modulate most important physiological functions of cells. MicroRNA-155 (miR-155) is a multifaceted regulator of cell proliferation, cell cycle, development, immunity and inflammation that plays pivotal, and sometimes contradictory, roles in numerous cancers including esophageal cancer. Here, we review the intricate role of miR-155 in cancer by exemplifying carcinogenesis of various tumors, focusing on recent findings that may provide a link between miR-155 and esophageal cancer-related pathways.",No evidence of effectiveness of mirror therapy early after stroke: an assessor-blinded randomized controlled trial.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30672304,Clinical rehabilitation,2019 04 23,The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of mirror therapy on upper-limb recovery in early post-stroke patients.,Capacitance of Basal Plane and Edge-Oriented Highly Ordered Pyrolytic Graphite: Specific Ion Effects.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30672302,The journal of physical chemistry letters,2019 02 15,"Carbon materials are ubiquitous in energy storage; however, many of the fundamental electrochemical properties of carbons are still not fully understood. In this work, we studied the capacitance of highly ordered pyrolytic graphite (HOPG), with the aim of investigating specific ion effects seen in the capacitance of the basal plane and edge-oriented planes of the material. A series of alkali metal cations, from Li+, Na+, K+, Rb+, and Cs+ with chloride as the counterion, were used at a fixed electrolyte concentration. The basal plane capacitance at a fixed potential relative to the potential of zero charge was found to increase from 4.72 to 9.39 μF cm-2 proceeding down Group 1. In contrast, the edge-orientated samples display capacitance ca. 100 times higher than those of the basal plane, attributed to pseudocapacitance processes associated with the presence of oxygen groups and largely independent of cation identity. This work improves understanding of capacitive properties of carbonaceous materials, leading to their continued development for use in energy storage."

Its genome replication is facilitated by the viral NS3 protein bearing helicase function. The NS3 helicase uses energy derived from adenosine triphosphate (ATP) hydrolysis to unwind RNA duplexed regions. Structural studies of the flavivirus NS3 helicases have suggested a conserved mechanism of ATP hydrolysis. However, the process of the reactant water replenishment, a key part of the hydrolysis cycle, remains elusive. Here, we report two high-resolution crystal structures of ZIKV NS3 helicase in complex with adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and Mn2+, one with the reactant water already loaded as previously observed and the other with the water molecule still in a loading state. These data suggest that the reactant water replenishment can occur between the release of phosphate and the release of ADP and improves the structural basis of the NS3 ATP hydrolysis cycle.","Probing the Interactions of 1-Alkyl-3-methylimidazolium Tetrafluoroborate (Alkyl = Octyl, Hexyl, Butyl, and Ethyl) Ionic Liquids with Bovine Serum Albumin: An Alkyl Chain Length-Dependent Study.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30672288,The journal of physical chemistry. B,2019 02 21,"Herein, we have investigated the binding interaction of bovine serum albumin (BSA) with a series of 1-alkyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate (alkyl = ethyl, butyl, hexyl, and octyl) ionic liquids (ILs) in physiological buffer medium. The ILs are chosen basically to understand the effect of alkyl chain length on IL-protein interaction. Experiments have shown that the quenching of fluorescence of BSA is induced by relatively longer alkyl chain-containing ILs, [OMIM][BF4] and [HMIM][BF4]. The enthalpy-driven spontaneous binding (-ve Δ G) of hexyl and octyl chain-containing ILs with the protein is mediated by both hydrogen-bonding and van der Waals interactions. The experimental data have categorically explained the denaturation of protein conformation upon interaction with both [OMIM][BF4] and [HMIM][BF4]. The molecular docking calculation nicely corroborates the experimentally obtained results. The present study reveals that neither a smaller alkyl group-containing IL nor a very large alkyl group-containing IL is necessary to have effective protein-IL interactions. The study also reveals the influence of hydrophobic interaction over and above the hydrogen-bonding interaction on protein-IL binding events and essentially gives an idea about the optimum hydrophobic character of the ILs that is necessary to induce protein-IL interaction and consequently the denaturation of the protein structure.",Glucose-Fueled Micromotors with Highly Efficient Visible-Light Photocatalytic Propulsion.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30672287,ACS applied materials & interfaces,2019 02 26,"Synthetic micro/nanomotors fueled by glucose are highly desired for numerous practical applications because of the biocompatibility of their required fuel. However, currently all of the glucose-fueled micro/nanomotors are based on enzyme-catalytic-driven mechanisms, which usually suffer from strict operation conditions and weak propulsion characteristics that greatly limit their applications. Here, we report a highly efficient glucose-fueled cuprous oxide@N-doped carbon nanotube (Cu2O@N-CNT) micromotor, which can be activated by environment-friendly visible-light photocatalysis. The speeds of such Cu2O@N-CNT micromotors can reach up to 18.71 μm/s, which is comparable to conventional Pt-based catalytic Janus micromotors usually fueled by toxic H2O2 fuel. In addition, the velocities of such motors can be efficiently regulated by multiple approaches, such as adjusting the N-CNT content within the micromotors, glucose concentrations, or light intensities. Furthermore, the Cu2O@N-CNT micromotors exhibit a highly controllable negative phototaxis behavior (moving away from light sources). Such motors with outstanding propulsion in biological environments and wireless, repeatable, and light-modulated three-dimensional motion control are extremely attractive for future practical applications.",Ti-Catalyst Biomimetic Sensor for the Detection of Nitroaromatic Pollutants.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30672286,Analytical chemistry,2019 02 19,"An electrode modified by a Ti complex in Nafion was used in the electrochemical detection of nitroaromatic compounds (NACs). The catalyst reduced nitroaromatic groups by a six-electron process with a high apparent rate constant, k1, which was estimated to be at least 19 000 mol-1 L s-1 by simulation of the first step of the cathodic reduction of 4-nitrophenylacetic acid, which was used as model molecule. The modified electrode was prepared and optimized in terms of Nafion and catalyst concentrations. In the chosen analytical medium, the Ti-catalyst-containing electrode showed good stability in the presence of nitro species. A standard deviation around 15% was calculated on the analysis performed with 28 different modified electrodes, which could be expected for a drop-coating process. We show that the modified electrode detects several nitroaromatic compounds such as nitrophenols, mononitroaniline, and dinitrotoluene with detection limits ranging from 1 × 10-4 to 9 × 10-4 g L-1 (0.2 × 10-6 to 5.1 × 10-6 mol L-1). As an interesting feature, the sensor exhibits good selectivity toward NAC detection because titanocene does not catalyze the reduction of nitroaliphatic compounds.","Pendant Photochromic Conjugated Polymers Incorporating a Highly Functionalizable Thieno[3,4- b]thiophene Switching Motif.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30672284,Journal of the American Chemical Society,2019 02 20,"The ability to externally modulate conjugated polymer optoelectronic properties is an important challenge for modern organic electronics. One attractive approach entails the incorporation of stimuli-responsive molecular systems, such as diarylethenes, into polymeric materials. Our approach involves the design of polymers possessing photochromic moieties pendant to the main conjugated chain to allow for electronic influence along the polymer backbone while avoiding substantial conformational demands that may affect solid-state performance. Herein, we report the synthesis of a series of thieno[3,4- b]thiophene (TT)-based photochromes that demonstrate drastically different optoelectronic properties upon cyclization. Experimental and computational investigations of aryl-extended model compounds provided crucial insight on the interplay between electronic structure and photochromic activity, thus allowing for the realization of pendant photoswitchable conjugated copolymers that reflect the activity found in the related model systems.",Intergrain Connection of Organometal Halide Perovskites: Formation Mechanism and Its Effects on Optoelectrical Properties.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30672283,ACS applied materials & interfaces,2019 03 01,"Two-step processes are commonly used for the fabrication of organic-inorganic perovskite solar cells; they convert a PbI2 film to a perovskite film by dipping it in CH3NH3I (MAI) solution or spin-coating the MAI solution onto it. Dipping yields perovskite films with discrete and rough morphologies, whereas spinning yields films with smooth and connected morphologies. The residual MAI solution that remains after spinning is the key factor that governs the smoothness of the resulting morphology; centrifugal force has no influence. A perovskite layer forms as soon as the MAI solution is loaded onto the PbI2 film, then the MAI residues left after spinning dissolve this outermost perovskite layer. The subsequent recrystallization of the dissolved perovskites increases the connectivity and smoothness of the crystals. The final morphology is dependent on the degrees of dissolution and recrystallization, which can be controlled by varying the processing conditions. A post-thermal treatment can be applied to induce the additional dissolution of the perovskites, which results in an increase in the final grain size while maintaining good connectivity. Combining these results, we fabricated an optimal film morphology that gives rise to perovskite solar cells with improved efficiency. The optimal perovskite film has a smooth and connected morphology as well as better carrier transport than rough and discrete films. This article provides fundamental understanding of the mechanism of formation during two-step processes of connected perovskite morphologies that can guide the further development of two-step processes for the fabrication of optimal perovskite morphologies.",Attomolar Label-Free Detection of DNA Hybridization with Electrolyte-Gated Graphene Field-Effect Transistors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30672282,ACS sensors,2019 02 22,"In this work, we develop a field-effect transistor with a two-dimensional channel made of a single graphene layer to achieve label-free detection of DNA hybridization down to attomolar concentration, while being able to discriminate a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). The SNP-level target specificity is achieved by immobilization of probe DNA on the graphene surface through a pyrene-derivative heterobifunctional linker. Biorecognition events result in a positive gate voltage shift of the graphene charge neutrality point. The graphene transistor biosensor displays a sensitivity of 24 mV/dec with a detection limit of 25 aM: the lowest target DNA concentration for which the sensor can discriminate between a perfect-match target sequence and SNP-containing one.",Predictable Substituent Control of CoIII/II Redox Potential and Spin Crossover in Bis(dipyridylpyrrolide)cobalt Complexes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30672281,Inorganic chemistry,2019 02 15,"A family of five easily prepared tridentate monoanionic 2,5-dipyridyl-3-(R1)-4-(R2)-pyrrolide anions (dppR1,R2)-, varying in the nature of the R1 and R2 substituents [R1, R2 = CN, Ph; CO2Et, CO2Et; CO2Me, 4-Py; CO2Me, Me; Me, Me], has been used to generate the analogous family of neutral [CoII(dppR1,R2)2] complexes, two of which are structurally characterized at both 100 and 298 K.

The cobalt(II) centers in the low spin (LS) complexes are Jahn-Teller tetragonally compressed along the pyrrolide-Co-pyrrolide axis. The complexes in their high spin (HS) states are more distorted than in the LS states, as is also usually the case for SCO active iron(II) complexes.

To compare and explain the melting temperatures, the thicknesses of Au and Ag nanowires as parameters are analyzed. Scanning electron microscopy and focused ion beam imaging are used to observe the morphologies and cross sections of the fabricated samples. The evolution of 3D nanostructures is observed by atomic force microscopy, whereas the compositions and binding energies of the nanostructures are determined by X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopies. In addition, the atomic structures are analyzed by transmission electron microscopy, and the optical properties of the fabricated nanostructures are evaluated by spectrometry.

Pt-PhNI has better electronic communication between the Pt coordination center and the NI moiety, whereas in Pt-PhMeNI, they are more isolated by orthogonal geometry. For Pt-PhMeNI, the S0 → 1MLCT and S0 → 1LE absorption bands are separated by 5655 cm-1, while they are more overlapped in Pt-PhNI. The 3MLCT → S0 and 3LE → S0 dual phosphorescence emissions were observed for both Pt-PhNI (in toluene) and Pt-PhMeNI (in benzonitrile). The molecular conformation tunes the 3MLCT/3LE state population ratio, and the orthogonal geometry makes the 3LE state in Pt-PhMeNI basically a dark state (in toluene). Switching of the relative energy levels of the 3MLCT/3LE states by variation of the solvent polarity and temperature was achieved. For Pt-PhMeNI, the energy level of 3MLCT state is higher in a polar solvent; thus, the 3MLCT emission decreases, while the phosphorescence lifetime is prolonged from 9.5 μs (in toluene) to 58 μs (in benzonitrile) because of the different equilibria with the nonemissive 3LE state. Conversely, increasing the temperature enhances the upward transition from the nonemissive 3LE state to the emissive 3MLCT state; as such, the phosphorescence of Pt-PhMeNI was intensified at higher temperature (which is unusual), and the phosphorescence lifetime decreased from 58 μs (298 K) to ca. 5 μs (348 K). The ultrafast intersystem crossing (ca. 0.5 ps) and intramolecular triplet-triplet energy transfer (3-11 ps) were studied by femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy. These results are useful for an in-depth understanding of the photophysics of multichromophore transition-metal complexes and for the design of external stimuli-responsive sensing materials, for instance, temperature or microenvironment sensing materials.",Theoretical Insights into the Role of Water Molecules in the Guanidinium-Based Protein Denaturation Process in Specific to Aromatic Amino Acids.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30672268,The journal of physical chemistry. B,2019 03 14,"Noncovalent interactions between the guanidinium cation (Gdm+) and aromatic amino acids (AAs) in the water molecules have been studied using quantum chemical calculation and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Our studies show that there are two different modes of interactions between Gdm+ and AAs with and without water molecules. It is observed that nonhydrated Gdm+ interacts with AAs through N-H···π interactions, whereas hydrated clusters of Gdm+ are stabilized by stacking interactions with the help of the water-mediated hydrogen bond. Thus, different hydration patterns have significant effects on the predominant cation···π interactions in AAs-Gdm+ complexes. Findings from MD simulation elicit that the interaction pattern of Gdm+ with AAs varies as Phe < Tyr < Trp. Both the QM and MD calculations show a similar trend in the interaction of AAs with Gdm+. Moreover, the interaction of AAs with Gdm+ depends on the spatial orientation of AAs in the protein and the concomitant local structure, that is, the AAs present in the unstructured region of protein such as coils and bends exhibit higher binding for Gdm+ when compared to the AAs present in the structured region of the protein such as the α-helix and the β-sheet. Our study clearly reveals that H-bonded water molecules and the hydration pattern of Gdm+ as well as the positional presence of these AAs in the protein structure context play determining roles in the denaturation of protein by the Gdm+ cation.",[Systematic review and analysis on the appropriate diseases in clinical treatment with Fu's subcutaneous needling therapy].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30672266,Zhongguo zhen jiu = Chinese acupuncture & moxibustion,2019 01 23,"The clinical research articles relevant with Fu's subcutaneous needling therapy (FSN) were retrieved from CNKI, WANFANG, CBM and PubMed databases till January 2018 since the establishment of database.

This nano-in-micro hydrogel composite offers a simple yet highly effective method for sensitive and multiplexed cytokine analysis without complex enzyme-based signal amplification steps, greatly benefitting advanced immune medicine.",First description of a fatal equine infection with Halicephalobus gingivalis in Portugal. Relevance for public health.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30672155,Veterinary medicine and science,2019 05 08,"Halicephalobus gingivalis is a small saprophytic rhabditid nematode, represented only by females with a typical rhabditoid oesophagus and one egg in the uterus, capable of infecting vertebrates. This opportunistic parasite present in the soil, manure and decaying humus, is thought to penetrate through previous injuries to the mouth, eyes and skin of horses and migrate to various organs. The brain is one such organ, where the females lay their eggs, leading to malacia and causing a sudden onset of neurological signs, such as anorexia, ataxia, urinary incontinence, blindness, decreased menace and tonal reflexes, tremors and aggressiveness. The disease is invariably fatal whenever brain lesions are present, and the diagnosis usually achieved only post-mortem. The present work aims to describe the first case of infection by H. gingivalis ever reported in Portugal. An 8-year old warmblood horse presented with an 8-day history of progressive blindness involving the left eye, initially with normal pupillary reflexes, advancing to bilateral blindness and increasing deterioration in clinical condition. After euthanasia, the animal was submitted for necropsy. Organ samples were collected and fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for routine histopathology. A large mass was found in the left kidney corresponding to fibrous tissue heavily infiltrated with inflammatory cells and numerous nematodes. In the brain, multiple, bilateral and asymmetrical foci of malacia containing several rhabditoid nematodes, larvae and zygotes, and high numbers of inflammatory cells were found. The nematodes were identified as H. gingivalis. The clinical history, necropsy and histological findings presented constitute a typical case of H. gingivalis infection in a horse, never previously described in Portugal to the authors' best knowledge. Humans can be infected by contact with contaminated manure, which makes this nematode a public health concern, especially for people living and/or working in close proximity to horses.",Surfactant protein D as a marker for pulmonary complications in pediatric patients with sickle cell disease: Relation to lung function tests.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30672154,Pediatric pulmonology,2019 04 26,Surfactant protein D (SP-D) is considered a candidate biomarker for lung integrity and for disease progression.,Clinical staging for youth at-risk for serious mental illness.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30672153,Early intervention in psychiatry,2019 01 23,The first aim of this project was to identify a sample of youth who met different stages of risk for the development of a serious mental illness (SMI) based on a published clinical staging model.

Associations can range from mutualistic to parasitic, shaping biogeochemical cycles and having a direct influence on phytoplankton growth. How variations in phenotype and sampling location, affect the phytoplankton microbiome is largely unknown. A high-resolution characterization of the bacterial community in cultures of the dinoflagellate Alexandrium was performed on strains isolated from different geographical locations and at varying anthropogenic impact levels. Microbiomes of Baltic Sea Alexandrium ostenfeldii isolates were dominated by Betaproteobacteria and were consistent over phenotypic and genotypic Alexandrium strain variation, resulting in identification of an A. ostenfeldii core microbiome. Comparisons with in situ bacterial communities showed that taxa found in this A. ostenfeldii core were specifically associated to dinoflagellate dynamics in the Baltic Sea. Microbiomes of Alexandrium tamarense and minutum, isolated from the Mediterranean Sea, differed from those of A. ostenfeldii in bacterial diversity and composition but displayed high consistency, and a core set of bacterial taxa was identified. This indicates that Alexandrium isolates with diverse phenotypes host predictable, species-specific, core microbiomes reflecting the abiotic conditions from which they were isolated. These findings enable in-depth studies of potential interactions occurring between Alexandrium and specific bacterial taxa.",Association between the IL1R2 rs2072472 polymorphism and high-altitude pulmonary edema risk.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30672138,Molecular genetics & genomic medicine,2019 05 08,"High-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE), as a multifactorial disease, is caused by stress failure and involves both environmental and genetic factors.

We report a highly probable case of dengue viral transmission during live donor liver transplantation. Fever with severe thrombocytopenia was observed in the donor and recipient within 6 and 9 days after transplantation, respectively. Dengue diagnosis was confirmed by testing blood and explant tissue from the donor and recipient using dengue-specific NAT (nucleic acid testing) and serology. Serology indicated the donor had secondary dengue infection that ran a mild course. However, the dengue illness in the recipient was severe and deteriorated rapidly, eventually proving fatal. The recipient's explant liver tissue tested negative for viral RNA indicative of a pretransplant naïve status. The prM-Envelope gene sequence analysis of the donor and recipient viral RNA identified a similar serotype (DENV1) with almost 100% sequence identity in the envelope region. Molecular phylogenetic analysis of donor and recipient viral envelope sequences with regional and local dengue strains further confirmed their molecular similarity, suggesting a probable donor-to-recipient transmission via organ transplantation. Screening of living donors for dengue virus may be considered in endemic regions.","Early intervention service for first episode psychosis in Modena, Northern Italy: The first hundred cases.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30672134,Early intervention in psychiatry,2019 01 23,"To report on the development of an early intervention service in Modena, Italy, with information relevant to the first 4 years of implementation.",GATA5 inhibits hepatocellular carcinoma cells malignant behaviours by blocking expression of reprogramming genes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30672133,Journal of cellular and molecular medicine,2019 04 09,"Evidence indicated that GATA5 may suppress hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell malignant transformation, but the mechanism of how GATA5 affects cancer cell reprogramming to inhibit HCC malignant behaviour is still unclear. In this study, we report that the expression of β-catenin and reprogramming genes p-Oct4, Nanog, Klf4, c-myc and EpCAM was significantly higher in HCC tissues compared to normal liver tissues. In contrast, the expression of GATA5 was significantly lower in HCC tissues compared to normal liver tissues. Transfection of CDH-GATA5 vectors into HCC cells (HLE, Bel 7402 and PLC/PRF/5 cells) increased the GATA5 expression and decreased the expression of β-catenin and reprogramming genes p-Oct4, Nanog, Klf4, c-myc and EpCAM. Increased GATA5 expression by transfection with its expression vectors was also able to inhibit the cell growth, colony formation and capability of migration, invasion, while promoting apoptosis in HCC cells. Results revealed that GATA5 co-localization with β-catenin in the cytoplasm, preventing β-catenin from entering the nucleus. Treatment with the specific Wnt/β-catenin pathway inhibitor salinomycin was able to reduce the expression of β-catenin and reprogramming genes. Salinomycin exerted a similar influence as GATA5, and siRNA-GATA5 restored β-catenin and reprogramming gene expression. This study demonstrates that an increase in the expression of GATA5 inhibits the expression of β-catenin and reprogramming genes and suppresses tumour growth, colony formation, metastasis and invasion, while promoting apoptosis in HCC cells. The mechanism of GATA5 inhibiting the malignant behaviours of HCC cells may involve in the disruption of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway and the reduction of reprogramming gene expression.",Pseudomonas bacteriocin syringacin M released upon desiccation suppresses the growth of sensitive bacteria in plant necrotic lesions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30672132,Microbial biotechnology,2019 01 23,"Bacteriocins are regarded as important factors mediating microbial interactions, but their exact role in community ecology largely remains to be elucidated. Here, we report the characterization of a mutant strain, derived from Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 (Pst), that was incapable of growing in plant extracts and causing disease. Results showed that deficiency in a previously unannotated gene saxE led to the sensitivity of the mutant to Ca2+ in leaf extracts. Transposon insertions in the bacteriocin gene syrM, adjacent to saxE, fully rescued the bacterial virulence and growth of the ΔsaxE mutant in plant extracts, indicating that syrM-saxE encode a pair of bacteriocin immunity proteins in Pst. To investigate whether the syrM-saxE system conferred any advantage to Pst in competition with other SyrM-sensitive pathovars, we compared the growth of a SyrM-sensitive strain co-inoculated with Pst strains with or without the syrM gene and observed a significant syrM-dependent growth reduction of the sensitive bacteria on plate and in lesion tissues upon desiccation-rehydration treatment. These findings reveal an important biological role of SyrM-like bacteriocins and help to understand the complex strategies used by P. syringae in adaptation to the phyllosphere niche in the context of plant disease."

Being immobile during hospitalisation put these patients at a higher risk of PIs. There is little literature about pressure injury (PI) prevalence or PI incidence in immobile hospitalised patients in hospitals in China. This was a multicentre, cross-sectional, exploratory descriptive study. A total of 23 985 immobile patients were recruited from 25 general hospitals in six provinces of China from November 1, 2015 to March 18, 2016. Information was collected on demographic characteristics, physical assessment information, and treatment and nursing care measures. The PI period prevalence was 3.38%, and the PI cumulative incidence was 1.23%. Most PIs (84.03%) were Stage 1 or Stage 2. A total of 48.22% of PIs occurred in the sacrum or heel region. In the multivariate analysis, the following factors were associated with higher PI prevalence: age, gender, length of immobility, type of hospital, modified Braden Scale score, urinary incontinence, faecal incontinence, low serum albumin, the usage of fixation or restraint devices, and patient's discharge diagnosis (lower limb fracture, malnutrition, and spinal cord injury). PI prevalence for immobile hospitalised patients in the study was lower than those reported in literature. However, because of the large population in China, the number of patients who suffer with PIs can be very high. The relating factors of higher PI prevalence identified in this study were consistent with current literature. Patients with a higher number of these associated factors should be monitored more closely, and preventative measures should be taken to prevent PI occurrence in high-risk populations.",Donor mucosal immunocytes perpetuate refractory GVHD after intestinal transplantation without engrafting in recipient bone marrow: Case report and review of the literature.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30672115,Pediatric transplantation,2019 03 20,"GVHD as a complication of SOT presents both a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. Typically affecting the skin, gastrointestinal tract, and liver, GVHD occurs when donor lymphocytes engrafted in recipient tissues are activated by host antigen-presenting cells resulting in cytokine release and donor cell-mediated cytotoxicity to host tissue. Here, we describe a 5-year-old girl who developed fatal, refractory GVHD after isolated intestinal transplantation when recipient immune cells failed to repopulate the allograft in the setting of CMV viremia. Persistence of the donor immune cells in the allograft mucosa, rather than engraftment in the recipient bone marrow, likely perpetuated this refractory GVHD. Early diagnosis and intervention are critical to reduce morbidity and mortality. Thus, periodic monitoring of peripheral blood and allograft mucosal chimerism with sensitive detection methods may allow early detection and potentially curative enterectomy in similar cases of refractory GVHD.",Surfactant-assisted-water-exposed versus surfactant-aqueous-solution-exposed electrospinning of novel super hydrophilic Polycaprolactone-based fibers: Cell culture studies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30672114,Journal of biomedical materials research. Part A,2019 05 03,"Blend electrospun scaffolds composed of Polycaprolactone and Pluronic are suitable for bone tissue engineering due to their excellent biocompatibility and hydrophilicity. However, exceeding from certain amounts of Pluronic, surface enrichment of this polymer leads to segregation of Pluronic chains within the fiber, endangering the integrity and mechanical properties of the scaffold. In this article, a novel method of blend electrospinning has been employed using a parallel water supply, positioning the Pluronic chains on the surface, thus enhancing the miscibility within the fibers. Water uptake test revealed the super hydrophilicity of obtained scaffolds. Atr-FTIR and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy verified a higher percentage of Pluronics on the surface in comparison with conventional blend electrospinning. Tensile test demonstrated improved mechanical properties of the modified scaffolds. The results of cytocompatibility tests have also revealed enhanced viability of cells on these scaffolds confirming their great promise for clinical applications. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Carbohydrate units derived from a component of bacterial cell wall, peptidoglycan (PG), are known to stimulate an immune response. Nonetheless, access to modified late-stage peptidoglycan intermediates is limited due to their synthetic complexity. A method to rapidly functionalize PG fragments is needed to better understand the natural host-PG interactions. Here methyl N,O-hydroxylamine linkers are incorporated onto a synthetic PG derivative, muramyl dipeptide (MDP). The modification of MDP maintained the ability to stimulate a nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) immune response dependent on the expression of nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein 2 (Nod2). Intrigued by this modification's maintenance of biological activity, several applications were explored. Methyl N,O-hydroxylamine MDP was amendable to N-hydroxylsuccinimide (NHS) chemistry for bioconjugation to fluorophores as well as a self-assembled monolayer for Nod2 surface plasmon resonance analysis. Finally, linker incorporation was applicable to larger PG fragments, both enzymatically generated from Escherichia coli or chemically synthesized. This methodology provides rapid access to PG probes in one step and allows for the installation of a variety of chemical handles to advance the molecular understanding of PG and the innate immune system.",Modulation of macrophage phenotype via phagocytosis of drug-loaded microparticles.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30672109,Journal of biomedical materials research. Part A,2019 05 07,"Monocyte-derived macrophages play a critical role in directing wound pathology following injury. Depending on their phenotype, macrophages also promote tissue regeneration. However, the therapeutic administration of macrophages with a controlled phenotype is challenging because macrophages are highly plastic and quickly revert to a detrimental, inflammatory phenotype in response to the environment of a damaged tissue. To address this issue, we developed a novel strategy to modulate macrophage phenotype intracellularly through phagocytosis of drug-loaded microparticles. Poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) microparticles loaded with the anti-inflammatory drug dexamethasone (Dex) were phagocytosed by monocytes and stored intracellularly for at least 5 days. After differentiation into macrophages, cell phenotype was characterized over time with high-throughput gene expression analysis via NanoString. We found that the microparticles modulated macrophage phenotype for up to 7 days after microparticle uptake, with decreases in inflammation-related genes at early timepoints and upregulation of homing- and phagocytosis-related genes at multiple timepoints in a manner similar to cells treated with continuous free Dex. These data suggest that intracellularly loading macrophages with Dex microparticles via phagocytosis could be a unique methodology to selectively modulate macrophage phenotype over time. This strategy would allow therapeutic administration of macrophages for the treatment of a number of inflammatory disease and disorders. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

However, the anti-cancer effect of JS-K in gastric cancer has not been reported. In this study, we found that JS-K inhibited the proliferation of gastric cancer cells in vitro and in vivo and triggered mitochondrial apoptosis. Moreover, JS-K induced a significant accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and the clearance of ROS by antioxidant reagents reversed JS-K-induced toxicity in gastric cancer cells and subcutaneous xenografts. Although JS-K triggered significant NO release, NO scavenging had no effect on JS-K-induced toxicity in vivo and in vitro. Therefore, ROS, but not NO, mediated the anti-cancer effects of JS-K in gastric cancer. We also explored the potential mechanism of JS-K-induced ROS accumulation and found that JS-K significantly down-regulated the core proteins of mitochondria respiratory chain (MRC) complex I and IV, resulting in the reduction of MRC complex I and IV activity and the subsequent ROS production. Moreover, JS-K inhibited the expression of antioxidant enzymes, including copper-zinc-containing superoxide dismutase (SOD1) and catalase, which contributed to the decrease of antioxidant enzymes activity and the subsequent inhibition of ROS clearance. Therefore, JS-K may target MRC complex I and IV and antioxidant enzymes to exert ROS-dependent anti-cancer function, leading to the potential usage of JS-K in the prevention and treatment of gastric cancer.",History of posttraumatic stress disorder and outcomes after kidney transplantation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30672107,American journal of transplantation : official journal of the American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons,2019 02 15,"A history of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), if uncontrolled, represents a contraindication for kidney transplantation.

Clinical data from a prospectively maintained database were used to assess outcomes including patient and graft survival. Of 174 recipients, 90 were adults and 84 were pediatric patients. Types of visceral transplants were isolated intestinal transplant (56.3%), combined liver-intestinal transplant (25.3%), multivisceral transplant (16.1%), and modified multivisceral transplant (2.3%). Three-, 5-, and 10-year overall patient survival was 69.5%, 66%, and 63%, respectively, while 3-, 5-, and 10-year overall graft survival was 67%, 62%, and 61%, respectively.

Resistance mechanisms against this pathogen in soybean are poorly understood, thus hindering the commercial deployment of resistant varieties. We used a multiomic approach utilizing RNA-sequencing, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry-based metabolomics and chemical genomics in yeast to decipher the molecular mechanisms governing resistance to S. sclerotiorum in soybean. Transcripts and metabolites of two soybean recombinant inbred lines, one resistant and one susceptible to S. sclerotiorum were analysed in a time course experiment. The combined results show that resistance to S. sclerotiorum in soybean is associated in part with an early accumulation of JA-Ile ((+)-7-iso-jasmonoyl-L-isoleucine), a bioactive jasmonate, increased ability to scavenge reactive oxygen species, and importantly, a reprogramming of the phenylpropanoid pathway leading to increased antifungal activities. Indeed, we noted that phenylpropanoid pathway intermediates, such as 4-hydroxybenzoate, cinnamic acid, ferulic acid and caffeic acid, were highly accumulated in the resistant line. In vitro assays show that these metabolites and total stem extracts from the resistant line clearly affect S. sclerotiorum growth and development. Using chemical genomics in yeast, we further show that this antifungal activity targets ergosterol biosynthesis in the fungus, by disrupting enzymes involved in lipid and sterol biosynthesis. Overall, our results are consistent with a model where resistance to S. sclerotiorum in soybean coincides with an early recognition of the pathogen, leading to the modulation of the redox capacity of the host and the production of antifungal metabolites.",Efficacy and safety of IVIG in CIDP: Combined data of the PRIMA and PATH studies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30672091,Journal of the peripheral nervous system : JPNS,2019 03 15,"Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is a potential therapy for chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP).

Breeding programmes are therefore needed to improve yield under cultivation in soil. Traits from locally adopted landraces provide a resource to assist breeding of novel elite genotypes. Here, we examine differentially expressed proteins by performing comparative proteomic profiling of the albumin/globulin grain fraction of Tunisian barley genotype landraces with contrasting salinity tolerance. Tunisian barley Boulifa (B, tolerant) and Testour (T, sensitive) mature grains were assessed in 2-DE profiles. Differentially expressed spots, with an abundance enhanced 1.5-fold in the grain, were subjected to MALDI TOF/TOF MS for identification. Distinctiveness between tolerant and sensitive genotypes was proved in the albumin/globulin fraction using PCA; 64 spots showed significant differential abundance. Increased accumulation of 40 spots was confirmed in Boulifa with, interestingly, four genotype-specific spots. Two of these four spots were sHSP. Proteins with highest abundance were serpin Z7, 16.9 KDa Class I HSP and phosphogluconolactonase 2. Proteins such as expansin, kiwellin, kinesin and succinyl-CoA ligase were identified for the first time in barley grain. Moreover, ß-amylase, LEA family and others were identified as abundant in Boulifa. On the other hand, proteins more accumulated in Testour are implicated mainly in ROS scavenging and protease inhibition. Our results clearly indicate proteomic contrast between the two selected genotypes. With identification of specific HSP, high abundant stress-protective and other defined proteins, we provide biochemical traits that will support breeding programmes to address the threat of salinity in agricultural production.",A comparison of patients' and dietitians' perceptions of patient-centred care: A cross-sectional survey.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30672086,Health expectations : an international journal of public participation in health care and health policy,2019 06 10,The aim of this study was to compare patients' and dietitians' perceptions of patient-centred care (PCC) in dietetic practice.,Super-Bulky Penta-arylcyclopentadienyl Ligands: Isolation of the Full Range of Half-Sandwich Heavy Alkaline-Earth Metal Hydrides.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30672085,Angewandte Chemie (International ed. in English),2019 03 15,"Hydrogenolysis of the half-sandwich penta-arylcyclopentadienyl-supported heavy alkaline-earth-metal alkyl complexes (CpAr )Ae[CH(SiMe3 )2 ](S) (CpAr =C5 Ar5 , Ar=3,5-i Pr2 -C6 H3; S=THF or DABCO) in hexane afforded the calcium, strontium, and barium metal-hydride complexes as the same dimers [(CpAr )Ae(μ-H)(S)]2 (Ae=Ca, S=THF, 2-Ca; Ae=Sr, Ba, S=DABCO, 4-Ae), which were characterized by NMR spectroscopy and single-crystal X-ray analysis. 2-Ca, 4-Sr, and 4-Ba catalyzed alkene hydrogenation under mild conditions (30 °C, 6 atm, 5 mol % cat.), with the activity increasing with the metal size.

However, little is known about the effectiveness of restabilization with IVIG in patients who worsen after IVIG withdrawal. In the Polyneuropathy And Treatment with Hizentra (PATH) study, the pre-randomization period included sudden stopping of IVIG followed by 12 weeks of observation. Those deteriorating were then restabilized with IVIG. Of 245 subjects who stopped IVIG, 28 did not show signs of clinical deterioration within 12 weeks. Two hundred and seven received IVIG restabilization with an induction dose of 2 g/kg bodyweight (bw) IgPro10 (Privigen, CSL Behring, King of Prussia, Pennsylvania) and maintenance doses of 1 g/kg bw every 3 weeks for up to 13 weeks. Signs of clinical improvement were seen in almost all (n = 188; 91%) subjects. During IVIG restabilization, 35 subjects either did not show CIDP stability (n = 21, analyzed as n = 22 as an additional subject was randomized in error) or withdrew for other reasons (n = 14). Of the 22 subjects who did not achieve clinical stability, follow-up information in 16 subjects after an additional 4 weeks was obtained. Nine subjects were reported to have improved, leaving a maximum of 27 subjects (13%) who either showed no signs of clinical improvement during the restabilization phase and 4 weeks post-study or withdrew for other reasons.

Chemical derivatization was employed to introduce diastereomeric environments to the chiral compounds of interest, resulting in different abundance distribution patterns of fragment ions of the derivatization products of enantiomers in mass spectrometry. The quantitative information of the chiral compounds of interest was extracted from complex mass spectral data by an advanced calibration model derived based on the spectral shape deformation quantitative theory. The performance of the proposed method was tested on the quantitative analysis of R-propranolol in propranolol tablets. Experimental results demonstrated that it could achieve accurate and precise concentration ratio predictions for R-propranolol with an average relative predictive error (ARPE) of about 4%, considerably better than the corresponding results of the mass spectrometric method based on chemical derivatization and the univariate ratiometric model (ARPE: about 12%). The limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) of the proposed method for the concentration ratio of R-propranolol were estimated to be 1.5% and 6.0%, respectively.

The in vitro cytotoxicity results indicated that BMN 673 had considerable inhibitory effects on HCC1937 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines by inducing apoptosis, multicaspase activity, G2/M arrest, and altering the expression levels of apoptosis-related genes (P < 0.01). Additionally, BMN 673 indicated no toxicity on MCF-10A control cells until a certain concentration and incubation time. However, BMN 673, a novel and selective poly ADP ribose polymerase inhibitor, was more potent in TNBC cells bearing BRCA1 mutant than those with wild-type BRCA1. In conclusion, our study, for the first time, demonstrated a molecular mechanism of the induction of apoptosis by BMN 673 in TNBC with different genetic profile.

In this study, toxic mechanisms of puerarin on the structure and function of catalase were studied by multiple spectroscopic techniques, isothermal titration calorimetric measurement, and molecular docking methods in vitro. Results showed puerarin could inhibit the activity of catalase due to direct interactions between puerarin and catalase, resulting in conformational and functional changes of the enzyme. To be specific, puerarin statically quenched catalase fluorescence, bound into the active site channel of catalase, hindered the path of the catalytic substrate (H2 O2 ), affected its skeleton conformation and secondary structure, and interacted with the enzymatically related residues through hydrophobic interactions (ΔH > 0 and ΔS > 0) spontaneously (ΔG < 0).

Here we show that it is also an effective inducer of apoptosis in vivo in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. In addition, the anemone peptides rapidly paralyze C. elegans, and set in motion a sequence of events that result in the complete dissolution of the internal organs in adult animals within 60 min. Nematodes that survive the toxin treatment exhibit a decreased reproductive capacity. Interestingly, adult animals appear to be much more susceptible to the effects of the toxins than larval stages, suggesting possible developmentally dependent targets of the toxins. Here we also provide chemical characterization of the compounds through chromatographic analysis and mass spectrometry. Gel filtration chromatography coupled with reverse phase HPLC shows that our partially purified extract contains at least two principle components. Additionally, MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry analysis of our extract shows three principal compounds at 814.6, 2914.1, and 4360.3 m/z plus three other minor components or fragments.

To unravel this problem, an animal model of long-term TAM administration to cycling young adult female rats was used to evaluate its effects in the liver. Body weight and food consumption were monitored, and at the end of the study, both parameters were lower in TAM-treated rats. Biochemical measurements showed that the TAM administration induced alterations in serum levels of liver enzymes when compared with control rats at different stages of the estrous cycle. In TAM-treated rats, lower glycogen storage was observed in hepatocytes close to the portal areas and pericentrolobular cells had a higher concentration of glycogen. Liver sections of TAM-treated rats presented mild steatosis-a high percentage of area occupied by lipid droplets in the hepatocytes. These results point to metabolic changes upon long-term TAM therapy.","Pru p 7 sensitization is a predominant cause of severe, cypress pollen-associated peach allergy.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30672059,Clinical and experimental allergy : journal of the British Society for Allergy and Clinical Immunology,2019 03 28,"Peach is a common elicitor of food allergic reactions.

In this study, we isolated igalan from I. helenium L. and evaluated the effects of igalan on signaling pathways and expression of target genes in HepG2 cells. Igalan activated the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway by increasing the inactive form of GSK3β, the phosphorylated form of AKT, and the nuclear accumulation of Nrf2. Thus, target genes of Nrf2 such as HO-1 and NQO1 increased in HepG2 cells. Moreover, igalan inhibited the tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)-induced nuclear factor-κB activation and suppressed the expression of its target genes, including TNF-α, interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-8 in HepG2 cells. Our results indicate the potential of igalan as an activator of cellular defense mechanisms and a detoxifying agent."

Carrier densities below the Mott density for large polarons (≤ ≈1018 cm-3 ) are focused on here. As in other semiconductors, a nascent hot electron distribution initially cools down via emission of longitudinal optical (LO) phonons on the 10-14 -10-13 s timescale. What distinguishes LHPs from conventional semiconductors is the exceptionally efficient screening in the former. The dielectric screening in LHPs on the 10-13 s timescale results in an order-of-magnitude reduction in the Coulomb potential upon the formation of a large polaron, likely with ferroelectric-like local ordering. Further LO-phonon emission is inhibited, and this leads to partial retention of hot electron energy on the 10-12 s timescale, more so in hybrid LHPs than in their all-inorganic counterparts. Further cooling of hot polarons occurs on the 10-10 s timescale, and this can be attributed to the slow diffusion of heat out of the large polaron volume due to the low thermal conductivity of LHPs. Like other carrier properties, slow hot carrier cooling in LHPs can be intimately related to efficient screening in a soft, anharmonic, and dynamically disordered lattice.",In vitro antimicrobial activity of topical otological antimicrobials and Tris-EDTA against resistant Staphylococcus pseudintermedius and Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates from dogs.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30672043,Veterinary dermatology,2019 04 01,"The value of susceptibility tests for the selection of topical otological antimicrobial agents is unclear.

Recently, researchers have attempted to use patient-level instrumental variables, such as differential distance, to solve this problem of a provider-level endogenous treatment variable in settings where patients are nested within providers. However, to satisfy validity assumptions, an instrumental variable for a provider attribute must be at the provider level or a larger unit of aggregation, not at the patient level. A patient-level instrument cannot predict variation in a provider attribute separately from other, potentially unmeasured, provider attributes.

Undesirably, strong electrostatic attraction from the anions of most dopants localizes the holes created on the polymer, reducing their mobility. Here, a new strategy utilizing a substituted boron cluster as a molecular dopant for conjugated polymers is employed. By designing the cluster to have a high redox potential and steric protection of the core-localized electron density, highly delocalized polarons with mobilities equivalent to films doped with no anions present are obtained. AC Hall effect measurements show that P3HT films doped with these boron clusters have conductivities and polaron mobilities roughly an order of magnitude higher than films doped with F4 TCNQ, even though the boron-cluster-doped films have poor crystallinity. Moreover, the number of free carriers approximately matches the number of boron clusters, yielding a doping efficiency of ≈100%. These results suggest that shielding the polaron from the anion is a critically important aspect for producing high carrier mobility, and that the high polymer crystallinity required with dopants such as F4 TCNQ is primarily to keep the counterions far from the polymer backbone.",Nigella sativa essential oil and its bioactive compounds as resistance modifiers against Staphylococcus aureus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30672036,Phytotherapy research : PTR,2019 06 13,"Nigella sativa essential oil (EO) and its compounds (thymoquinone, carvacrol, and p-cymene) have a broad antimicrobial spectrum.

The disease affects millions of people worldwide with an associated risk of mobility disability. However, the molecular basis underlying OA initiation and progression is not well understood and, currently, there is no effective intervention available to decelerate disease progression or restore degraded cartilage. We have found that lncRNA long intergenic nonprotein coding RNA 341 (LINC00341) is aberrantly downregulated in OA patient tissues and cultured OA chondrocytes. This is likely responsible for the increased apoptosis of chondrocytes and pathological destruction of cartilage. Further investigation has revealed that LINC00341 interacts with miR-141 to suppress its functional binding to the 3'-untranslated region of YY1-associated factor 2 (YAF2) messenger RNA. Aberrant downregulation of LINC00341 thus may ultimately lead to inhibition of the YAF2 protein, which has been implicated to be an antiapoptotic factor. Our study has revealed a new noncoding RNA-mediated regulatory network that highly likely protects chondrocytes by preventing apoptosis under normal conditions. The results will help further explore the molecular details pertaining to the progression of OA and stimulate efforts to develop effective therapies.",Deletion of SMURF 1 represses ovarian cancer invasion and EMT by modulating the DAB2IP/AKT/Skp2 feedback loop.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30672020,Journal of cellular biochemistry,2019 04 11,"SMAD ubiquitination regulatory factor 1 (SMURF1) has been described as a tumor suppressor in multiple aggressive cancers. Nevertheless, the potential role of SMURF1 in ovarian cancer invasion and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) remains unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of SMURF1 on tumor migration and EMT and elucidate the underlying molecular mechanism in ovarian carcinoma. We found elevated SMURF1 in several ovarian cancer cells in both messenger RNA and protein. Additionally, silencing SMURF1 apparently repressed cell proliferation and invasion capacity of SKOV3 and A2780 cells and markedly attenuated expression of linked proteins such as proliferating cellnuclear antigen, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, and MMP-9. Furthermore, depletion of SMURF1 dramatically impeded EMT progress by modulating EMT biomarkers, with a notable increase in E-cadherin expression accompanied by the decrease in N-cadherin and vimentin in both SKOV3 and A2780 cells. Interestingly, elimination of SMURF1 led to disabled homolog 2 DOC-2/DAB2 interacting protein (DAB2IP) activation and dampened AKT/Skp2 signaling. Most important, depleted of DAB2IP or treatment with the AKT agonist 740Y-P effectively abolished the suppressive effects of SMURF1 knockout on cell invasiveness and EMT process. Taken all data together, these findings demonstrated that the absence of SMURF1 repressed cell proliferation, invasive capability, and EMT process in ovarian cancer through DAB2IP/AKT/Skp2 signaling loops, suggesting that SMURF1 may serve as a new potential therapeutic agent for ovarian cancer.",Clinical utility of ultrasonography-measured visceral adipose tissue depth as a tool in early pregnancy screening for gestational diabetes: a proof-of-concept study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30672019,Diabetic medicine : a journal of the British Diabetic Association,2019 06 14,"To examine, in a proof-of-concept study, the ability of visceral adipose tissue depth and subcutaneous fat depth measured in early pregnancy to predict subsequent gestational diabetes, and to assess the performance of these measures as screening tests for gestational diabetes compared with use of the current UK criteria.",Construction of a chimeric antigen receptor bearing a nanobody against prostate a specific membrane antigen in prostate cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30672018,Journal of cellular biochemistry,2019 04 11,"Adoptive transfer of T cells expressing chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) is considered to be a novel anticancer therapy. To date, in most cases, single-chain variable fragments (scFvs) of murine origin have been used in CARs. However, this structure has limitations relating to the potential immunogenicity of mouse antigens in humans and the relatively large size of scFvs. For the first time, we used camelid nanobody (VHH) to construct CAR T cells against prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA). The nanobody against PSMA (NBP) was used to show the feasibility of CAR T cells against prostate cancer cells. T cells were transfected, and then the surface expression of the CAR T cells was confirmed. Then, the functions of VHH-CAR T cell were evaluated upon coculture with prostate cancer cells. At the end, the cytotoxicity potential of NBPII-CAR in T cells was approximated by determining the cell surface expression of CD107a after encountering PSMA. Our data show the specificity of VHH-CAR T cells against PSMA+ cells (LNCaP), not only by increasing the interleukin 2 (IL-2) cytokine (about 400 pg/mL), but also the expression of CD69 by almost 38%. In addition, VHH-CAR T cells were proliferated by nearly 60% when cocultured with LNCaP, as compared with PSMA negative prostate cancer cell (DU-145), which led to the upregulation of CD107a in T cells upto 31%. These results clearly show the possibility of using VHH-based CAR T cells for targeted immunotherapy, which may be developed to target virtually any tumor-associated antigen for adoptive T-cell immunotherapy of solid tumors.",Assessing the severity of Type 2 diabetes using clinical data-based measures: a systematic review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30672017,Diabetic medicine : a journal of the British Diabetic Association,2019 05 10,To identify and critically appraise measures that use clinical data to grade the severity of Type 2 diabetes.,Current status and future prospects of transforming growth factor-β as a potential prognostic and therapeutic target in the treatment of breast cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30672016,Journal of cellular biochemistry,2019 01 23,"The transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling pathway is one of the important pathways involved in the cancer cell proliferation, invasion, migration, angiogenesis, apoptosis, as well as in metastasis by agitation or invasion of metastasis-related factors, including matrix metalloproteinase (MMP), epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), tumor microenvironment (TME), cancer stem cells (CSCs), and cell adhesion molecules (CAMs). These data suggest its potential value as a therapeutic object in the treatment of malignancies including breast cancer.

Physicians often have access to many covariates that may be used when making sequential treatment decisions for individual patients. Statistical variable selection methods may help finding which of these variables are used for this decision in everyday practice. When the sample size is not large, Bayesian variable selection methods can address this setting and allow for expert information to be incorporated into prior distributions. Motivated by clinical practice data involving repeated dose adaptation for Irinotecan in colorectal metastatic cancer, we propose a modification of the stochastic search variable selection (SSVS) method, which we call weight-based SSVS (WBS). We use clinical relevance weights elicited from physician experts to construct prior distributions, with the goal to identify the most influential toxicities and other covariates used for dose adjustment. We evaluate and compare the WBS model performance to the Lasso and SSVS through an extensive simulation study. The simulations show that WBS has better performance and lower rates of false positives and false negatives than the other methods but depends strongly on the covariate weights.",Attractylone attenuates sepsis-associated encephalopathy and cognitive dysfunction by inhibiting microglial activation and neuroinflammation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30672013,Journal of cellular biochemistry,2019 01 23,"Multiple studies demonstrated that sepsis is a life-threatening state of organ dysfunction caused by infection and can induce neuroinflammation and cognitive impairment. The aim of this study was to evaluate the protective effects of attractylone (Atr) on sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) and cognitive dysfunction. Moreover, we studied the underlying molecular mechanisms. We used an LPS-induced sepsis mouse model and evaluated the cognitive function with the Morris water maze and open field test. Neuronal damage in the hippocampus was assessed by immunohistochemical analysis. BV2 cells were used to identify the protective mechanism of Atr. The result showed that Atr attenuated LPS-induced cognitive impairment, neural apoptosis, inflammatory factors, and microglial activation. The in vitro experiment showed that Atr promoted silent information regulator 1 (SIRT1) expression and suppressed NFκB expression. Downregulation of SIRT1 reversed the protective effect of Atr in the LPS condition. Moreover, Atr-induced SIRT1 expression promoted BV2 from LPS-induced M1 to M2 phenotype. Taken together, these results indicated that Atr was a potential therapeutic agent for SAE and cognitive dysfunction.",Trainees' perspectives of assessment messages: a narrative systematic review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30672012,Medical education,2019 03 07,"This study was designed as a narrative systematic literature review of medical specialist trainees' perspectives of the assessment messages they receive in the context of clinical performance assessments.

Chemical paralysis with neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) has been used to decrease time to abdominal closure. We sought to evaluate the effect of NMBA use on sedation requirements in patients with an open abdomen and to determine the effect of sedation on patient outcomes. A retrospective cohort study was conducted at an American College of Surgeons' verified level 1 trauma center. Adult trauma patients who underwent DCL between 2009 and 2015 were included. Patients with an intensive care unit length of stay of less than 48 hours and those who died before abdominal closure were excluded. The NMBA+ group received continuous NMBA within 24 hours of DCL; the NMBA- group did not. The primary outcome was cumulative sedation dose during the 7 days following DCL. Secondary outcomes included Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS) score, mechanical ventilation-free days, and delirium-coma-free days. Delirium-coma-free days were analyzed with linear regression. A total of 222 patients were included (NMBA+ 125; NMBA- 97). Demographics were similar between groups including age, Injury Severity Score, and mechanism of injury. The median time to closure in the overall cohort was 2 days (interquartile range [IQR] 1-2 days). Propofol and fentanyl were the primary sedatives used. The NMBA+ group received higher cumulative doses of propofol (NMBA+ 5405 mg, IQR 3103-10,573 mg; NMBA- 3601 mg, IQR 1605-6887 mg; p=0.007), but not of fentanyl. Time to abdominal closure, but not NMBA use, was associated with a higher cumulative propofol dose on multivariate analysis. The NMBA+ group had significantly lower RASS scores on the first 3 days following DCL. Mechanical ventilation-free days (NMBA+ 20 days vs NMBA- 18 days, p=0.960) and delirium-coma-free days (NMBA+ 18 days vs NMBA- 18 days, p=0.610) were similar between the groups. On linear regression, cumulative propofol dose was associated with fewer delirium-coma-free days (β-coefficient -0.007, 95% confidence interval -0.015 to -0.003). In trauma patients managed with DCL, higher cumulative sedative doses were administered in patients who received adjunctive NMBA, although NMBA therapy was not associated with a higher cumulative propofol dose on multivariate analysis.

Yet molecular transport through the oil phase is a well-known problem for liquid oil-based double emulsions. The influence of network crystallization in the oil phase of W/O/W globules was evaluated by NMR and laser light scattering experiments on both a liquid oil-based double emulsion and a solid fat-based double emulsion. Water transport was assessed by low-resolution NMR diffusometry and by an osmotically induced swelling or shrinking experiment, whereas manganese ion permeation was followed by means of T2 -relaxometry. The solid fat-based W/O/W globules contained a crystal network with about 80% solid fat. This W/O/W emulsion showed a reduced molecular water exchange and a slower manganese ion influx in the considered time frame, whereas its globule size remained stable under the applied osmotic gradients. The reduced permeability of the oil phase is assumed to be caused by the increased tortuosity of the diffusive path imposed by the crystal network. This solid network also provided mechanical strength to the W/O/W globules to counteract the applied osmotic forces.","Ultrastructural and histochemical study of previtellogenic oogenesis in the desert lizard Scincus mitranus (Squamata, Sauropsida).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30671996,Journal of morphology,2019 02 12,"The structure of the granulosa in reptilian sauropsids varies between groups. We investigated the follicle development in the desert lizard Scincus mitranus. In the germinal bed, oogonia, and primary oocytes were identified and found to be interspersed between the epithelial cells. Previtellogenesis was divided into three stages: early, transitional, and late previtellogenic stages. During the early previtellogenic stage (diplotene), the oocyte is invested by small epithelia cells that formed a complete single layer, which may be considered as a young follicle. The transitional previtellogenic stage was marked by proliferation and differentiation of the granulosa layer from a homogenous layer consisting of only small cells to a heterogeneous layer containing three cell types: small, intermediate, and large cells. The late previtellogenic stage was marked by high-synthetic activity of large cells and the initiation of cytoplasmic bridges between large granulosa cells and the oocyte. Small cells were the only type of granulosa cells that underwent division. Thus, these cells may be stem cells for the granulosa cell population and may develop into intermediate and subsequently large cells. The intermediate cells may be precursors of large cells, as suggested by their ultrastructure. The ultrastructure of the large granulosa was indicative of their high synthetic activity. Histochemical analysis indicated the presence of cholesterol and phospholipids in the cytoplasm of large cells, the zona pellucida, among the microvilli, in the bridges region, and in the cortical region of the oocyte cytoplasm. These materials may be transferred from large cells into the oocyte through cytoplasmic bridges and provide nutritive function to large cells rather than functioning in steroidogenesis or vitellogenesis.",Patients-in-waiting or chronically healthy individuals? People with elevated cholesterol talk about risk.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30671995,Sociology of health & illness,2019 06 04,"Risk adopts an ambiguous position between health and illness/disease and is culturally salient in various health-related everyday practices. Previous research on risk experience has mostly focused on the illness/disease side of this risk ambiguity. Persons at risk have typically been defined as patients (of some kind) and their condition as a form of proto-illness. To allow for the cultural proliferation of health risk and to account for the health side of risk ambiguity, I chose to focus on elevated cholesterol, a condition both intensely medicalised and connected to the everyday practice of eating, among participants (n = 14) recruited from a consumer panel and approached not as patients, but as individuals concerned about their cholesterol. Utilising the biographical disruption framework developed by Bury, I show how the risk experience of my participants differed from the chronic illness experience. Instead of patients-in-waiting suffering from a proto-illness, they presented themselves as 'chronically healthy individuals' (Varul 2010), actively trying to avoid becoming patients through a responsible regimen of personal health care. The results call for a more nuanced approach to the risk experience, which accounts for both sides of the risk ambiguity.",Towards a unified perinatal theory: Reconciling the births-based and fetus-at-risk models of perinatal mortality.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30671994,Paediatric and perinatal epidemiology,2019 05 07,There is a need to reconcile the opposing perspectives of the births-based and fetuses-at-risk models of perinatal mortality and to formulate a coherent and unified perinatal theory.,Efficacy of winter-spring strategic control against Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus infestations on cattle in an area with ecological conditions highly favourable for the tick in northeast Argentina.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30671993,Medical and veterinary entomology,2019 05 09,"This work was performed to test the efficacy of winter-spring control strategies against Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus (Ixodida: Ixodidae) infestations on cattle in the area ecologically most favourable for the development of this tick in Argentina.

Animals in Group 1 were treated with ivermectin 3.15% on day 0, fluazuron on day 34, and fipronil on day 85. Animals in Group 2 were treated with ivermectin 3.15% on day 0, fluazuron on day 34, flumethrin on day 85, and fipronil on day 114. Animals in Group 3 represented the control group. Both treatment schemes provided appropriate levels of efficacy against R. microplus and also prevented the occurrence of the major peak in the frequency of this tick in autumn. The two treatment schemes were similar in terms of efficacy and thus the addition of a fourth treatment does not seem to confer any further advantage.

In this article, we investigate how clients with severe mental illnesses (e.g. schizophrenia) advocate for their treatment preferences in psychiatric consultations. The study uses Conversation Analysis to examine audio-recorded medication check appointments in a comprehensive treatment programme known as assertive community treatment (ACT). The analysis shows that clients solicit medication changes at activity boundaries and design them in one of the following ways: reporting a physical problem; reporting a medication problem; explicitly requesting a medication change; and demanding a change. These formats put pressure on the psychiatrist to respond by either offering a solution to the client's problem or by accepting or rejecting the client's request. Through a detailed analysis of clients' communicative behaviours, we show that, in soliciting a medication change, clients ordinarily respect boundaries of medical authority and present themselves as 'good' patients who are reliable witnesses of their own experiences. Overall, the paper advances our understanding of patient advocacy in psychiatry and mental health interactions more generally."

The intestine absorbs nonphosphorylated B6 vitamers, which are converted by specific enzymes to the active PLP form. The role of PLP is enabled by its reactive aldehyde group. Pathways reliant on PLP include amino acid and neurotransmitter metabolism, folate and 1-carbon metabolism, protein and polyamine synthesis, carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, mitochondrial function and erythropoiesis. Besides the role of PLP as a cofactor B6 vitamers also play other cellular roles, for example, as antioxidants, modifying expression and action of steroid hormone receptors, affecting immune function, as chaperones and as an antagonist of Adenosine-5'-triphosphate (ATP) at P2 purinoceptors. Because of the vital role of PLP in neurotransmitter metabolism, particularly synthesis of the inhibitory transmitter γ-aminobutyric acid, it is not surprising that various inborn errors leading to PLP deficiency manifest as B6 -responsive epilepsy, usually of early onset. This includes pyridox(am)ine phosphate oxidase deficiency (a disorder affecting PLP synthesis and recycling), disorders affecting PLP import into the brain (hypophosphatasia and glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor synthesis defects), a disorder of an intracellular PLP-binding protein (PLPBP, previously named PROSC) and disorders where metabolites accumulate that inactivate PLP, for example, ALDH7A1 deficiency and hyperprolinaemia type II. Patients with these disorders can show rapid control of seizures in response to either pyridoxine and/or PLP with a lifelong dependency on supraphysiological vitamin B6 supply.

The study included 48 children (32 controls, 16 cystinosis) and 56 adults (25 controls, 25 carriers, and 6 cystinosis). Participants were instructed to replicate 10 hierarchical stimuli to assess global-local processing. The primary outcome measure was mean global and local performance on the hierarchical stimuli task between subgroups. Error subtypes were included to further assess each image. Compared to the control subgroups, adult and child cystinosis patients as well adult carriers demonstrated significant deficits in the global processing of a hierarchical stimulus against a background of unimpaired local processing. Child cystinosis patients performed significantly more poorly than controls on all error subtypes except local shape distortion. Adult cystinosis patients and carriers made significantly more global shape distortion errors than the controls. Our study shows that the cognitive profile documented in cystinosis patients and carriers includes significant difficulties with the global processing of an image. Results of the carrier population are important since they suggest that the cognitive impairments observed in patients cannot be attributed to symptomatic manifestations of the disease.

Exposure to rotating night and day shifts, even if only in early pregnancy, may adversely affect maternal metabolic and pregnancy outcomes.",Water column dissolved silica concentration limits microphytobenthic primary production in intertidal sediments.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30671969,Journal of phycology,2019 02 25,"Primary production of microphytobenthos (MPB) contributes significantly to the total production in shallow coastal environments. MPB is a diverse community in which diatoms are usually the main microalgal group. Diatoms require N, P, and other nutrients as with other autotrophs, but in addition require silicate to create their outer cell wall. Therefore, dissolved silica (DSi) might be a potential limiting factor for benthic primary production in areas with reduced freshwater input. To test this hypothesis, a microcosm experiment was conducted using intact sediment cores collected from an intertidal mudflat in the Bay of Cádiz and supplied with increasing concentrations of DSi (0, 5, 10, 25, and 45 μmol · L-1 ). After 7 d of enrichment, we determined chlorophyll a and c (Chl a, c) contents, metabolic rates (Net [Pn ] and Areal Gross [PgA ] Production and Light [RL ] and Dark [RD ] Respiration), as well as fluxes of inorganic nutrients across the sediment-water interface. Chl a and c contents increased significantly with respect to the initial conditions but no differences between treatments were found. Both Pn and PgA showed a saturating-like pattern with silicate concentration, reaching maximum rates at a DSi concentration of 45 μmol · L-1 . The addition of DSi also resulted in an increase of DSi and ammonium uptake by the sediment, which was significantly higher in light than in darkness. Our results clearly show that water column DSi concentrations have a direct impact on benthic primary production, also controlling other related processes such as inorganic nutrient fluxes.",Pediatric dysphagia: Is interarytenoid mucosal height significant?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30671968,The Laryngoscope,2019 01 23,"The clinical significance of the interarytenoid mucosal height (IAMH) in pediatric dysphagia, ranging from normal anatomy to a laryngeal cleft, is unknown.

Previous studies have shown that dihydrotestosterone (DHT) may be involved in regulating CL regression, but the mechanism is still unclear. In this study, we evaluated the localization of the two isoforms of DHT synthetase 5α-reductase (5α-red1 and 5α-red2) and androgen receptor (AR) in sheep CL, and investigated 5α-red1, 5α-red2, AR, and DHT levels at different luteal stages of CL (early, middle, and late phase) by immunohistochemistry, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, and western blot analysis. Moreover, we cultured luteal cells from middle phase CL and treated them with different concentrations of DHT (10-10 -10 -6  M) and the AR antagonist flutamide (10 -5  M), to evaluate whether DHT is involved in the regulation of progesterone (P4) secretion and progesterone nuclear receptor (PGR) expression and whether these effects are regulated by the AR pathway. We also investigated the effects of DHT and flutamide on prostaglandin F2α (PGF2α) secretion and apoptotic gene and protein expression. Our results showed that 5α-red1, 5α-red2, and AR were expressed in the CL, and their expression and DHT levels were changed during the luteal phase. DHT was involved in mediating P4 and PGF2α secretion and PGR and apoptotic gene and protein expression. The effects of DHT on CL were at least partially regulated by the AR pathway. This study reveals the mechanism of action of DHT on sheep CL regression and lays the foundation for further exploration of androgen regulation of CL function.","New record of a sharpnose sevengill shark Heptranchias perlo (Elasmobranchii, Hexanchidae) from the Balearic Sea, western Mediterranean Sea.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30671953,Journal of fish biology,2019 05 08,"In March 2018, an immature female sharpnose sevengill shark Heptranchias perlo was caught by a commercial bottom trawler in the Ibiza Channel.

However, there is inherent potential conflict in mutualisms, as each organism benefits more when the exchange ratio ('price') minimizes its own costs and maximizes its benefits. Understanding the bargaining power that each partner has in these interactions is key to our ability to predict the exchange ratio and therefore the functionality of the cell, organism, community and ecosystem. We tested whether partners have symmetrical ('fair') or asymmetrical ('unfair') bargaining power in a legume-rhizobia nitrogen-fixing symbiosis using measurements of carbon and nitrogen dynamics in a mathematical modeling framework derived from economic theory. A model of symmetric bargaining power was not consistent with our data. Instead, our data indicate that the growth benefit to the plant (Medicago truncatula) has greater weight in determining trade dynamics than the benefit to the bacteria. Quantitative estimates of the relative power of the plant revealed that the plant's influence rises as soil nitrogen availability decreases and trade benefits to both partners increase. Our finding that M. truncatula legumes have more bargaining power than their rhizobial partner at lower nitrogen availabilities highlights the importance of context-dependence for the evolution of mutualism with increasing nutrient deposition.",A systematic review of reported outcomes and outcome measures in randomized controlled trials on apical prolapse surgery.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30671950,International journal of gynaecology and obstetrics: the official organ of the International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics,2019 05 01,"Evidence on efficacy and safety of pelvic organ prolapse interventions is variable, and methodological flaws preclude meaningful synthesis of primary research data.",The Senses of Birth intervention to decrease cesarean and prematurity rates in Brazil.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30671949,International journal of gynaecology and obstetrics: the official organ of the International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics,2019 05 01,"To increase knowledge and promote cultural change toward valuing normal birth, and to lower rates of cesarean and unnecessary interventions during childbirth in Brazil via the Senses of Birth (SoB) exhibition.","International clinical practice recommendations on the definition, diagnosis, assessment, intervention, and psychosocial aspects of developmental coordination disorder.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30671947,Developmental medicine and child neurology,2019 02 08,"These international clinical practice recommendations (CPR) for developmental coordination disorder (DCD), initiated by the European Academy of Childhood Disability (EACD), aim to address key questions on the definition, diagnosis, assessment, intervention, and psychosocial aspects of DCD relevant for clinical practice."

E3N is a prospective cohort of 98,995 French women aged 40-65 years in 1990. MHT use was assessed through biennial self-administered questionnaires. We used Cox proportional hazards regression models adjusted for age and skin cancer risk factors. Over 1990-2008, 444 melanoma cases were ascertained among 75,523 postmenopausal women. Ever use of MHT was associated with a higher melanoma risk (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.35, 95% confidence intervals (CI) = 1.07-1.71). The association was strongest among past users (HR = 1.55, CI = 1.17-2.07, homogeneity for past vs. recent use: p = 0.11), and users of MHT containing norpregnane derivatives (HR = 1.59, CI = 1.11-2.27), although with no heterogeneity across types of MHT (p = 0.13).

We found that TAM-like cells promoted CSC-like properties in NSCLC cells in vitro, which was mediated by TAM-derived IL-10. TAM-derived IL-10 promoted CSC-like properties of NSCLC cells through JAK1/STAT1/NF-κB/Notch1 signaling. Blockade of IL-10/JAK1 signaling inhibited TAM-mediated NSCLC tumor growth in vivo, and the TAM-mediated expression of CSC-related and mesenchymal-related genes in NSCLC. Lastly, expression levels of these signaling molecules were significantly correlated with survival of NSCLC patients. Therefore, IL-10/JAK1 signaling might be a potential therapeutic target for NSCLC treatment.",Clinically-indicated replacement versus routine replacement of peripheral venous catheters.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30671926,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,2019 04 10,US Centers for Disease Control guidelines recommend replacement of peripheral intravenous catheters (PIVC) no more frequently than every 72 to 96 hours.

Decisions about coverage of new interventions are often more efficient when they consider between-patient heterogeneity, which is usually operationalized as different selections for different subgroups. While most model-based cost-effectiveness studies are populated with aggregated-level sub-group estimates, individual-level data are recognized as the best source of evidence to produce unbiased and efficient estimates to explore this heterogeneity. This paper extends a previously published framework to assesses the added value of having access to individual-level data, compared to using aggregate-level data only, in the absence/presence of mutually exclusive population subgroups. Supported by a case study on the cost-effectiveness of interventions to increase uptake of smoke-alarms, the extended framework provided a quantification of the benefits foregone of not using individual-level data, pointed to the optimal number of subgroups and where further research should be undertaken. Although not indicating changes in reimbursement decisions, results showed that irrespective of using aggregate or individual-level data, no substantial additional gains are obtained if more than two subgroups are taken into account. However, depending on the evidence type used, different subgroups are revealed as warranting larger research funds. The use of individual-level data, rather than aggregate, may however influence not only the extent to which an appropriate understanding of existing heterogeneity is attained, but, more importantly, it may shape approval decisions for particular population subgroups and judgements of future research."

However, meal-based, as opposed to daily, dietary protein recommendations are likely more informative given the role of the daily protein distribution pattern in modulating the post-exercise muscle protein synthetic response. Current protein meal recommendations to plateau post-exercise muscle protein synthesis rates are based on the ingestion of isolated protein sources, and not protein-rich whole foods. It is generally more common to eat whole food sources of dietary protein within a normal eating pattern to meet dietary protein requirements. Yet, there is a need to define how dietary protein action on muscle protein synthesis rates can be modulated by other nutrients within a food matrix to achieve protein requirements for optimal muscle adaptations. Recent developments suggest that the identification of an ""optimal"" protein source should likely consider the characteristics of the protein and the food matrix in which it is consumed. This review aims to discuss recent concepts related to protein quality, and the potential interactive effects of the food matrix, to achieve optimal protein requirements and elicit a robust postprandial muscle protein synthetic response with an emphasis on the post-exercise recovery window.",Phytochemicals for Improving Aspects of Cognitive Function and Psychological State Potentially Relevant to Sports Performance.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30671903,"Sports medicine (Auckland, N.Z.)",2019 05 15,"Subjective alertness and optimal cognitive function, including in terms of attention, spatial/working memory and executive function, are intrinsic to peak performance in many sports. Consumption of a number of plant-derived 'secondary metabolite' phytochemicals can modulate these psychological parameters, although there is a paucity of evidence collected in a sporting context. The structural groups into which these phytochemicals fall-phenolics, terpenes and alkaloids-vary in terms of the ecological roles they play for the plant, their toxicity and the extent to which they exert direct effects on brain function. The phenolics, including polyphenols, play protective roles in the plant, and represent a natural, benign component of the human diet. Increased consumption has been shown to improve cardiovascular function and is associated with long-term brain health. However, whilst short-term supplementation with polyphenols has been shown to consistently modulate cerebral blood-flow parameters, evidence of direct effects on cognitive function and alertness/arousal is currently comparatively weak. Terpenes play both attractant and deterrent roles in the plant, and typically occur less frequently in the diet. Single doses of volatile monoterpenes derived from edible herbs such as sage (Salvia officinalis/lavandulaefolia) and peppermint (Mentha piperita), diterpene-rich Ginkgo biloba extracts and triterpene-containing extracts from plants such as ginseng (Panax ginseng/quinquefolius) and Bacopa monnieri have all been shown to enhance relevant aspects of cognitive function and alertness. The alkaloids play toxic defensive roles in the plant, including via interference with herbivore brain function. Whilst most alkaloids are inappropriate in a sporting context due to toxicity and legal status, evidence suggests that single doses of nicotine and caffeine may be able to enhance relevant aspects of cognitive function and/or alertness. However, their benefits may be confounded by habituation and withdrawal effects in the longer term. The efficacy of volatile terpenes, triterpene-rich extracts and products combining low doses of caffeine with other phytochemicals deserves more research attention.",From Paper to Podium: Quantifying the Translational Potential of Performance Nutrition Research.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30671902,"Sports medicine (Auckland, N.Z.)",2019 05 15,"Sport nutrition is one of the fastest growing and evolving disciplines of sport and exercise science, demonstrated by a 4-fold increase in the number of research papers between 2012 and 2018.

Microscopic findings were similar to the nasal specimen; therefore, the pancreatic lesion was considered to be a metastasis from the nasal cavity.",Measuring the accuracy of propofol target-controlled infusion (TCI) before and after surgery with major blood loss.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30671895,Journal of clinical monitoring and computing,2019 01 23,"Target-controlled infusion (TCI) is based on pharmacokinetic models designed to achieve a desired drug level in the blood. TCI's predictive accuracy of plasma propofol levels at the end of surgery with major blood loss has not been well established. This prospective observational study included adult patients (BMI 20-35 kg/m2) undergoing surgery with expected blood loss ≥ 1500 mL. The study was conducted with the Schnider TCI propofol model (Alaris PK Infusion Pump, CareFusion, Switzerland). Propofol levels were assessed in steady-state at the end of anaesthesia induction (Tinitial) and before the end of surgery (Tfinal). Predicted propofol levels (CTCI) were compared to measured levels (Cblood). Twenty-one patients were included. The median estimated blood loss was 1600 mL (IQR 1000-2300), and the median fluid balance at Tfinal was + 3200 mL (IQR 2320-4715). Heart rate, mean arterial blood pressure, and blood lactate did not differ significantly between Tinitial and Tfinal. The median bispectral index (0-100) was 50 (IQR 42-54) and 49 (IQR 42-56) at the two respective time points. At Tinitial, median CTCI was 2.2 µmol/L (IQR 2-2.45) and Cblood was 2.0 µmol/L (bias 0.3 µmol/L, limits of agreement - 1.1 to 1.3, p = 0.33). CTCI and Cblood at Tfinal were 2.0 µmol/L (IQR 1.6-2.2) and 1 µmol/L (IQR 0.8-1.4), respectively (bias 0.6 µmol/L, limits of agreement - 0.89 to 1.4, p < 0.0001). Propofol TCI allows clinically unproblematic conduct of general anaesthesia. In cases of major blood loss, the probability of propofol TCI overestimating plasma levels increases.Trial registration German Clinical Trials Register (DRKS; DRKS00009312).",Non-sinusoidal waves in the EEG and their simulated effect on anaesthetic quantitative EEG monitors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30671894,Journal of clinical monitoring and computing,2019 01 23,"The effect of anaesthetic drugs on the cortex are commonly estimated from the electroencephalogram (EEG) by quantitative EEG monitors such as the Bispectral Index (BIS). These monitors use ratios of high to low frequency power which assumes that each neurological process contributes a unique frequency pattern. However, recent research of the effect of deep brain stimulation on EEG beta oscillations suggests that wave shape, a non-sinusoidal feature that is only measurable in the time-domain, can change the frequency 'signature' of a neurological rhythmical process by the inclusion or removal of harmonic frequencies. If wave shape variations are present in the EEG of anaesthetised patients, then quantitative EEG monitors likely overestimate the anaesthetic drug effect. The purpose of this paper is to investigate alpha-wave shape in the EEG of anaesthetised patients and demonstrate the effect of wave shape on the frequency ratios that are commonly utilised in the BIS quantitative EEG monitor. EEG data, demographic information, and surgery details were collected prospectively from 305 patients undergoing a general anaesthetic for elective surgery. Alpha-wave shape was categorised by triangularity of the EEG extrema, a measure of how peaked (towards a sawtooth wave) or flat (towards a square wave) the extremum was. The alpha-wave was then artificially modified to either a sawtooth wave or square wave, and BetaRatio and PowerFastSlow metrics calculated. Age was found to be the only significant predictor of alpha wave triangularity. The artificially modified square-alpha waves increased the power in the frequency spectrum at 26 Hz by 1-5 dB, and increased the BetaRatio by 0.7. The alpha-wave of anaesthetised patients contains non-sinusoidal components which likely impact depth of anaesthesia calculations.",Medical Student Exposure to Radiation Oncology Through the Pre-clerkship Residency Exploration Program (PREP): Effect on Career Interest and Understanding of Radiation Oncology.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30671893,Journal of cancer education : the official journal of the American Association for Cancer Education,2019 01 23,"Medical students receive little exposure to Radiation Oncology (RO) during pre-clinical training and clerkship. Pre-clerkship Residency Exploration Program (PREP) was developed by medical students at our institution to provide students with exposure to disciplines like RO with which they may not have had previous exposure, with the goal of helping with career decision making. The purpose of this study was to review how PREP affected self-reported interest in RO. PREP is a 2-week intensive elective developed by students at Dalhousie University that provides exposure to 12 specialties, including RO. PREP includes five components: half day clinical rotations, skills sessions, simulations, specialty-specific workshops, and lunchtime panel discussions. PREP participants completed questionnaires pre- and post-participation to assess career interest and understanding of Radiation Oncology. Forty participants took part in PREP. Thirty-six responded to pre-PREP questionnaires and 37 to the post-PREP questionnaire. Participants reported increasing interest in RO (24 students, 64.8%) and an increase in the understanding of the role and responsibilities of a radiation oncologist such that they felt comfortable making a career decision about RO. In pre-PREP, five (13.8%) participants listed RO as a top 3 career choice. Post-program, this number increased to nine (25.0%) of the same surveyed participants. PREP has demonstrated early exposure to RO can increase interest in RO as a career choice. Early clinical exposure experiences like we describe here may be useful for specialties such as RO, which is having difficulty filling residency positions in Canada despite an optimistic job forecast for trainees.",Improving Precursor Selectivity in Data-Independent Acquisition Using Overlapping Windows.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30671891,Journal of the American Society for Mass Spectrometry,2019 04 19,"A major goal of proteomics research is the accurate and sensitive identification and quantification of a broad range of proteins within a sample. Data-independent acquisition (DIA) approaches that acquire MS/MS spectra independently of precursor information have been developed to overcome the reproducibility challenges of data-dependent acquisition and the limited breadth of targeted proteomics strategies. Typical DIA implementations use wide MS/MS isolation windows to acquire comprehensive fragment ion data. However, wide isolation windows produce highly chimeric spectra, limiting the achievable sensitivity and accuracy of quantification and identification. Here, we present a DIA strategy in which spectra are collected with overlapping (rather than adjacent or random) windows and then computationally demultiplexed. This approach improves precursor selectivity by nearly a factor of 2, without incurring any loss in mass range, mass resolution, chromatographic resolution, scan speed, or other key acquisition parameters. We demonstrate a 64% improvement in sensitivity and a 17% improvement in peptides detected in a 6-protein bovine mix spiked into a yeast background. To confirm the method's applicability to a realistic biological experiment, we also analyze the regulation of the proteasome in yeast grown in rapamycin and show that DIA experiments with overlapping windows can help elucidate its adaptation toward the degradation of oxidatively damaged proteins. Our integrated computational and experimental DIA strategy is compatible with any DIA-capable instrument. The computational demultiplexing algorithm required to analyze the data has been made available as part of the open-source proteomics software tools Skyline and msconvert (Proteowizard), making it easy to apply as part of standard proteomics workflows.

Peripheral nerve degeneration leads to distal motor or sensory disorders such as diabetic neuropathy, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, and Gullain-Barré syndrome, with symptoms such as dysesthesia, speech impairment, vision change, erectile dysfunction, and urinary incontinence. Schwann cells play an important role in peripheral nerve degeneration. Therefore, revealing the characteristics of Schwann cells will be essential in understanding peripheral neurodegeneration-related diseases for which there is currently no effective treatment. Trichostatin A (TSA) is a noncompetitive, reversible inhibitor of class I and II histone deacetylases (HDACs). HDACs have been shown not only to deacetylate histones but also to target non-histone proteins involved in diverse signaling pathways. Recent studies have revealed that diverse HDAC subtypes regulate peripheral neurodegeneration. Thus, regulating HDAC levels could be an effective strategy for the development of drugs targeting peripheral nerve-related diseases. In fact, the use of TSA has been investigated for the treatment of many diseases, including degenerative diseases of the central nervous system; however, the effects of TSA on peripheral neurodegeneration have not yet been well established. In this study, we revealed the effect of TSA on the process of peripheral neurodegeneration. TSA successfully inhibited myelin fragmentation, axonal degradation, and trans-dedifferentiation and proliferation of Schwann cells, which are essential phenotypes in peripheral neurodegeneration. Therefore, TSA could be a potential drug for patients suffering from peripheral neurodegeneration-related diseases.","Racial Discrimination, Protective Processes, and Sexual Risk Behaviors Among Black Young Males.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30671878,Archives of sexual behavior,2019 02 13,"Racial discrimination is a documented risk factor for sexual risk behaviors among young Black men. Mechanisms of effect and protective processes remain to be investigated. This study examined the mediating effect of emotional distress, self-regulation, and substance use on the association between racial discrimination and sexual risk behaviors. Sexual risk behaviors included in this study were inconsistent condom use and sexual concurrency (sexual partnerships that overlap overtime). The protective effect of protective social ties was also investigated. A sample of 505 heterosexually active men aged 19-22 years were recruited and surveyed for 3 time points. Men answered questions on racial discrimination, sexual risk behaviors, emotional distress, self-regulation, and substance use. Mediation and moderation models were tested. Racial discrimination (T1) significantly and positively predicted emotional distress (T2). Emotional distress, substance use, and self-regulation partially mediated the association between racial discrimination and sexual risk behaviors. Protective social ties attenuated the effects of emotional distress on substance use and self-regulation. Racial discrimination is an important context for sexual risk behaviors. Minority stress may translate to sexual risk behavior through psychosocial mediators, such as emotional distress, self-regulation, and substance use. Protective social ties may buffer against emotional distress to reduce substance use and increase self-regulation. The findings of this study can provide new insights through the investigation of risk and protective processes that influence sexual risk behaviors among young Black men.",The Role of Inhibitory Control Mechanisms in the Regulation of Sexual Behavior.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30671876,Archives of sexual behavior,2019 03 05,"Sexual behavior is the open manifestation of a complex interplay between psychophysiological mechanisms that either facilitate or inhibit sexual thoughts, desires, and associated behaviors. Whereas sexual excitation has been widely studied, less is known about the impact of inhibitory control mechanisms that enable individuals to refrain from sexual cognition and behavior. The present study examined: (1) the relationship between general and sexual inhibitory mechanisms (as measured through self-reports and computer-based tasks), (2) the relation between sexual inhibitory processes at cognitive and motor-motivational levels and with sexual inhibition as an individual trait, and (3) the predictive value of these parameters on sexual thoughts (cognition) and behavior. We demonstrate that general inhibitory control (i.e., the ability to suppress any preponderant response) and the specific inhibition of sexual responses represent distinct processes that require at least partly different control mechanisms. Similarly, the ability to inhibit sexual visual input and the ability to suppress sexually driven responses seem to be two independent processes. The different inhibitory processes distinctively predicted the frequency of sexual thoughts and sexual behavior. We propose that these different inhibitory mechanisms are at play during different phases of sexual regulation (before and after the generation and unfolding of sexual arousal) and that a specific deficit in one of these processes may underlie the distinctive symptomatology and comorbidity of sexual disorders.",Nutrients and Nutraceuticals for the Management of High Normal Blood Pressure: An Evidence-Based Consensus Document.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30671873,High blood pressure & cardiovascular prevention : the official journal of the Italian Society of Hypertension,2019 03 14,"Essential hypertension still represents the most common cardiovascular risk factor, which is responsible for the vast majority of global burden of disease, worldwide. Antihypertensive treatment aimed at lowering blood pressure (BP) levels to the recommended therapeutic targets has demonstrated to reduce risk of developing major cardiovascular, cerebrovascular and renal complications. Despite these evidence, overall rates of BP control are dramatically low in most European and Western countries, as well as in the so called developing countries, thus contributing to the increasingly amount of hypertension-related costs and disabilities. For these reasons, preventive strategies aimed at improving BP control rates in treated hypertensive patients and reducing high-normal BP levels in asymptomatic otherwise healthy individuals may contribute to reduce the burden of disease related to hypertension. In this view, an extensive use of nutrients and nutraceuticals has demonstrated to provide favorable effects in hypertension management and control, beyond the adoption of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions. These interventions can effectively and safely reduce BP levels to targets and prevent disease progression form high-normal BP levels towards stage 1 hypertension. The present consensus document will systematically describe and critically analyze the currently available evidence in favor of the use of nutrients and nutraceuticals in those individuals with high-normal BP levels at different cardiovascular risk profile.",Two-Hourly Repositioning for Prevention of Pressure Ulcers in the Elderly: Patient Safety or Elder Abuse?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30671872,Journal of bioethical inquiry,2019 05 13,"For decades, aged care facility residents at risk of pressure ulcers (PUs) have been repositioned at two-hour intervals, twenty-four-hours-a-day, seven-days-a-week (24/7). Yet, PUs still develop. We used a cross-sectional survey of eighty randomly selected medical records of residents aged ≥ 65 years from eight Australian Residential Aged Care Facilities (RACFs) to determine the number of residents at risk of PUs, the use of two-hourly repositioning, and the presence of PUs in the last week of life. Despite 91 per cent (73/80) of residents identified as being at risk of PUs and repositioned two-hourly 24/7, 34 per cent (25/73) died with one or more PUs. Behaviours of concern were noted in 72 per cent (58/80) of residents of whom 38 per cent (22/58) were restrained. Dementia was diagnosed in 70 per cent (56/80) of residents. The prevalence of behaviours of concern displayed by residents with dementia was significantly greater than by residents without dementia (82 per cent v 50 per cent, p = 0.028). The rate of restraining residents with dementia was similar to the rate in residents without dementia. Two-hourly repositioning failed to prevent PUs in a third of at-risk residents and may breach the rights of all residents who were repositioned two-hourly. Repositioning and restraining may be unlawful. Rather than only repositioning residents two-hourly, we recommend every resident be provided with an alternating pressure air mattress.",Effect of a Pharmacist-Driven Medication Management Intervention Among Older Adults in an Inpatient Setting.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30671871,Drugs & aging,2019 06 04,Older adults have a seven times greater risk than younger adults of being hospitalized due to an adverse drug event.,"Asiatic Acid Attenuated Aluminum Chloride-Induced Tau Pathology, Oxidative Stress and Apoptosis Via AKT/GSK-3β Signaling Pathway in Wistar Rats.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30671870,Neurotoxicity research,2019 05 23,"Asiatic acid (AA), a triterpenoid present in Centella asiatica, possesses the ability to cross blood brain barrier and received considerable attention for its neuroprotective role. We have reported the benefit of AA against aluminum chloride (AlCl3)-induced amyloid pathology, enhanced acetylcholine esterase (AChE) activity, and inflammation in Alzheimer's disease (AD) like model rats. Based on that, to find the exact mechanism of action of AA, the present study was designed to evaluate the oxidative stress, tau pathology, apoptosis, and Akt/GSK3β signaling pathway on AlCl3-induced neurotoxicity in Wistar rats. AD-like pathology was induced by oral administration of AlCl3 (100 mg/kg b.w.) for 6 weeks, which demonstrated a significant reduction in spatial memory performance, anxiety, and motor dysfunction and diminished the expression of cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK 5-enzyme implicated in the phosphorylation of tau proteins), pTau, oxidative stress, and apoptosis, whereas oral ingestion of AA (75 mg/kg b.w.) for 7 weeks attenuated the above-said indices, which could be by activating Akt/GSK3β pathway. Current results suggested that AA could be able to modulate various pathological features of AD and could hold promise in AD treatment.",Brexpiprazole: A Review in Schizophrenia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30671869,Drugs,2019 04 03,"Brexpiprazole (Rxulti®, Rexulti®) is an oral atypical antipsychotic agent approved for the treatment of schizophrenia in the EU (in adult patients) and the USA, as well as in some other countries, including Japan. Like aripiprazole, it is a partial agonist at dopamine D2 and serotonin 5-HT1A receptors and an antagonist at serotonin 5-HT2A receptors. However, brexpiprazole displays less intrinsic activity at D2 receptors and, coupled with actions at 5HT1A, 5HT2A and noradrenaline α1B receptors that are at least as potent as its action at D2 receptors, is predicted to demonstrate a lower propensity for activating adverse events and extrapyramidal symptoms than aripiprazole. Brexpiprazole 2-4 mg/day produced statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in overall symptomatology and psychosocial functioning compared with placebo in adults with acute exacerbation of schizophrenia. As maintenance treatment, brexpiprazole 1-4 mg/day significantly delayed the time to relapse compared with placebo in patients who were already stabilized on the drug and was associated with stabilization or continued improvement in patients' symptoms and functioning. Brexpiprazole was generally well tolerated, exhibiting an adverse event profile characterized by a relatively low incidence of activating and sedating adverse effects, small changes in QT interval and metabolic parameters that were not clinically significant, and moderate weight gain. Clinical evidence to date suggests it usefully extends the range of therapeutic options for schizophrenia.",Working memory load affects early affective responses to concrete and abstract words differently: Evidence from ERPs.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30671868,"Cognitive, affective & behavioral neuroscience",2019 03 29,"Early posterior negativity (EPN) is an early-occurring, event-related, potential that is elicited by pictures and words that have highly arousing characteristics. Whilst EPN has been found with words presented in isolation several times, different types of words have shown quite different effects across different types of tasks. One possible reason for this is that memory and attentional demands may affect the way semantic features of words are processed, and this may modulate EPN. This was investigated in a silent reading task using abstract and concrete words of negative and neutral valence and a dual phonological working memory task to manipulate memory load. The results showed that abstract but not concrete words elicited EPN, and this may have affected downstream processing. Further analyses examining alpha desynchronization showed that negative concrete words appeared to be significantly affected by the memory load manipulation, unlike negative abstract words. These results provide evidence that the processing of features in negative concrete words is more affected by working memory and attentional demands than the processing of features in negative abstract words, and this may be responsible for the failure of negative concrete words to elicit EPN in this study. Thus, the extent to which words elicit EPN appears to be dependent on both their semantic representations and competing cognitive processes. These results provide a potential explanation for some of the differences that have been reported in previous experiments as well as insight into how memory and attention can affect the processing of the semantic features of words.","Diabetes mellitus, frailty and prognosis in very elderly patients with acute coronary syndromes.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30671867,Aging clinical and experimental research,2019 01 23,The magnitude of the association between diabetes (DM) and outcomes in elderly patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) is controversial.

HIV-infected (HIV+) antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naïve adults in rural Uganda underwent a neurocognitive battery for determination of HAND stage at baseline and after 2 years. Baseline serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OH-D) and serum and cerebrospinal fluids (CSF) vitamin D-binding protein (VDBP) were obtained. Of the 399 participants, 4% (n = 16) were vitamin D deficient (25OH-D < 20 ng/mL). There was no association between 25OH-D, serum or CSF VDBP, and HAND stage at baseline or follow-up.

Neurocognitive complications, typically known as HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND), persist in the era of ARVs and, in addition to risk of HAND, older PWH are also at risk for age-associated, neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's disease (AD). It has been postulated that risk for AD may be greater among PWH due to potential compounding effects of HIV and aging on mechanisms of neural insult. We are now faced with the challenge of disentangling AD from HAND, which has important prognostic and treatment implications given the more rapidly debilitating trajectory of AD. Herein, we review the evidence to date demonstrating both parallels and differences in the profiles of HAND and AD. We specifically address similarities and difference of AD and HAND as it relates to (1) neuropsychological profiles (cross-sectional/longitudinal), (2) AD-associated neuropathological features as evidenced from neuropathological, cerebrospinal fluid and neuroimaging assessments, (3) biological mechanisms underlying cortical amyloid deposition, (4) parallels in mechanisms of neural insult, and (5) common risk factors. Our current understanding of the similarities and dissimilarities of AD and HAND should be further delineated and leveraged in the development of differential diagnostic methods that will allow for the early identification of AD and more suitable and effective treatment interventions among graying PWH.",A case of fulminant Epstein-Barr virus encephalitis in an immune-competent adult.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30671776,Journal of neurovirology,2019 01 23,"A 21-year-old female presented with headache, nausea and vomiting, dysarthria, difficulty finding words, vertigo, episodical diplopia and an abnormal gait since 2 days. Additionally, we found marked ataxia and disturbed liver chemistry whilst her infection parameters were low. Her head CT scan was unremarkable, but her MRI scan showed leptomeningeal enhancement along the cerebellar folia. A lumbar punction revealed mononuclear leucocytosis and increased protein in her cerebrospinal fluid. She was admitted on a working diagnosis of herpes simplex encephalitis. Shortly after admission, she had a generalised seizure. She was tested for a wide range of viruses, bacteria and auto-immune antibodies and treated empirically with aciclovir, ceftriaxone, doxycycline and intravenous immunoglobulins. All tests continued to come back negative until the fifth day of admission, when repeat Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) serology showed evidence of an acute EBV infection, even though negative tests were acquired at admission. EBV encephalitis is a rare complication of EBV infection that is usually restricted to children and immune-compromised individuals. This is only the fifth case describing EBV encephalitis in an immune-competent adult, presenting with unique clinical features including a lack of fever and leptomeningeal enhancement on MRI investigation. Most interestingly, she tested negative for EBV until a few days after admission, underlining the need for repeated investigations in suspected virological encepahlitis. Even though our patient did not receive the often recommended glucocorticosteroids, she made a good neurological recovery.",Gender classification using mesh networks on multiresolution multitask fMRI data.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30671775,Brain imaging and behavior,2019 01 23,"Brain connectivity networks have been shown to represent gender differences under a number of cognitive tasks. Recently, it has been conjectured that fMRI signals decomposed into different resolutions embed different types of cognitive information. In this paper, we combine multiresolution analysis and connectivity networks to study gender differences under a variety of cognitive tasks, and propose a machine learning framework to discriminate individuals according to their gender. For this purpose, we estimate a set of brain networks, formed at different resolutions while the subjects perform different cognitive tasks. First, we decompose fMRI signals recorded under a sequence of cognitive stimuli into its frequency subbands using Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT). Next, we represent the fMRI signals by mesh networks formed among the anatomic regions for each task experiment at each subband. The mesh networks are constructed by ensembling a set of local meshes, each of which represents the relationship of an anatomical region as a weighted linear combination of its neighbors. Then, we estimate the edge weights of each mesh by ridge regression. The proposed approach yields 2CL functional mesh networks for each subject, where C is the number of cognitive tasks and L is the number of subband signals obtained after wavelet decomposition. This approach enables one to classify gender under different cognitive tasks and different frequency subbands. The final step of the suggested framework is to fuse the complementary information of the mesh networks for each subject to discriminate the gender. We fuse the information embedded in mesh networks formed for different tasks and resolutions under a three-level fuzzy stacked generalization (FSG) architecture. In this architecture, different layers are responsible for fusion of diverse information obtained from different cognitive tasks and resolutions. In the experimental analyses, we use Human Connectome Project task fMRI dataset. Results reflect that fusing the mesh network representations computed at multiple resolutions for multiple tasks provides the best gender classification accuracy compared to the single subband task mesh networks or fusion of representations obtained using only multitask or only multiresolution data. Besides, mesh edge weights slightly outperform pairwise correlations between regions, and significantly outperform raw fMRI signals. In addition, we analyze the gender discriminative power of mesh edge weights for different tasks and resolutions.",The Influence of Social Support and Social Integration Factors on Return to Work Outcomes for Individuals with Work-Related Injuries: A Systematic Review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30671774,Journal of occupational rehabilitation,2019 01 23,"Purpose In occupational rehabilitation, the biopsychosocial model endorses the role of social factors in worker recovery. We conducted a systematic review to explore three questions examining the role of social support for the return-to-work (RTW) of individuals with work-related injury: (1) What are the worker-identified social barriers and facilitators in RTW; (2) What is the relationship between social factors and RTW; and (3) What is the effectiveness of social interventions for RTW. Methods Systematic searches of six databases were conducted for each research question. These identified 11 studies meeting inclusion criteria for Research Question 1, and 12 studies for Research Question 2. No studies were identified that met inclusion criteria for Research Question 3. A narrative synthesis approach was used to analyse the included studies. Results Research Question 1 identified five themes in social barriers and facilitators to RTW, including contact/communication, person-centred approaches, mutual trust, reaction to injury, and social relationships. Research Question 2 identified moderate support for reaction to injury and social integration/functioning as predictors of RTW and weak evidence for co-worker support. Four studies reported significant associations between social factors and RTW, six reported mixed findings with at least one significant social predictor, and two found no significant relationships. However, conclusions were limited by the inconsistency in measurement of social factors. Conclusions Our findings indicate that social support and integration may influence RTW following work-related injury, and highlights the need for further systematic examination of social factors in the field of occupational rehabilitation.","Simultaneous Occurrence of Borrelia miyamotoi, Borrelia burgdorferi Sensu Lato, Anaplasma phagocytophilum and Rickettsia helvetica in Ixodes ricinus Ticks in Urban Foci in Bratislava, Slovakia.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30671773,Acta parasitologica,2019 04 05,"Questing Ixodes ricinus ticks were collected in two urban parks (Železná studienka and Horský park) of the capital city of Slovakia, Bratislava, during two consecutive years in 2011 and 2012.

Results demonstrated that sepiolite did not influence the contents of available nutrients in soils, although it significantly increased the pH value and decreased available Cd (CaCl2-extractable and exchangeable) contents and exchangeable and reducible Pb. Moreover, sepiolite increased the biomass in the aboveground part of maize, resulting in the reduction of Cd contents in maize plants and grains by 25.6-47.5%. Meanwhile, the biochar increased the contents of available nutrients in soils and decreased the contents of exchangeable Pb in soils and biomass in the aboveground part of maize plants and grains; decreased the Cd contents in maize stems and grains by 26.7% and 24.6%, respectively; and decreased the Pb content in roots by 16.2%. However, neither sepiolite nor biochar had considerable influence on the Pb content in maize grains. According to a correlation analysis, soil pH has extremely significant negative correlations with available Cd content in soils, which in turn have extremely significant positive correlation with the Cd content in maize plants and grains. These results revealed that sepiolite increases soil pH and decreases Cd bioavailability in farmland soils around the Pb-Zn mine. Furthermore, biochar increases the contents of available nutrients in farmland soils and the maize yield. Sepiolite and biochar both decrease the contents and transfer coefficients of Cd in maize plants and grains and are, thus, applicable to the immobilization remediation of Cd-polluted farmlands.",Convergence analysis of China's energy intensity at the industrial sector level.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30671758,Environmental science and pollution research international,2019 05 06,"China's industrial energy consumption accounted for approximately 70% of national energy demand in the past four decades. Regarding energy demand and environmental pollution, success in controlling energy demand and reducing energy intensity for industrial sectors in China would play a crucial role for the country's sustainable growth problems. To formulate targeted energy plans, the features and characters of China's industrial energy intensity should be carefully evaluated. In this study, a carefully designed econometric model that considers different technological factors including indigenous R&D and technology spillovers from foreign direct investment and trade under a united framework is applied to investigate the β-convergence characteristics for China's industrial energy intensity by employing a panel dataset covering China's 34 industrial sectors over 2000-2010. The results verify the existence of β-convergence in industrial energy intensity during the sample period. For the industrial sectors overall and the light industrial sectors, the empirical results indicate that indigenous R&D and technology spillovers from FDI and imports are beneficial in curbing energy intensity. However, technology spillover through exports makes it harder to reduce energy intensity. In addition, not all technological factors have played a significant role in reducing energy intensity for the heavy industrial sectors.",Strong insecticidal potential of methanol extract of Ferulago trifida fruits against Anopheles stephensi as malaria vector.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30671757,Environmental science and pollution research international,2019 05 06,"Many researchers have focused on controlling pest insects and vectors by natural products because of their low environmental pollution. The present study was conducted to evaluate the antioxidant and larvicidal activities of chloroform and methanol extracts of the leaves, fruits, roots, and isolated coumarin compounds (prantschimgin, oxypeucedanin, and 6-hydroxymethylherniarin) of Ferulago trifida from the Apiaceae family against Anopheles stephensi as one of the main malaria vectors. For insecticidal evaluation, A. stephensi larvae were exposed to different concentrations of the extracts and pure compounds (0.625-1280 ppm) according to the WHO protocol. The mortality percentages were measured 24 h after treatment and lethal concentration values were calculated. In addition, radical scavenging activities of the mentioned extracts and compounds were measured by the DPPH method. The methanol extract of fruits showed potent insecticidal properties with LC50 and LC90 values of 2.94 and 18.12 ppm, respectively. The chloroform extracts of the fruits and leaves were the second and third extracts with larvicidal effects. Among pure compounds, only oxypeucedanin showed moderate toxicity against A. stephensi with LC50 and LC90 values of 116.54 and 346.41 ppm, respectively. The antioxidant activities of the methanol extracts of leaves and fruits were stronger than other extracts with IC50 values of 155.83 and 159.32 ppm, respectively. In conclusion, the methanol extract of F. trifida fruits can be used as a potent bio-insecticide in green control programs of mosquitoes, especially A. stephensi.",Identifying Local Arterial Stiffness to Assess the Risk of Rupture of Ascending Thoracic Aortic Aneurysms.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30671756,Annals of biomedical engineering,2019 03 13,"It was recently submitted that the rupture risk of an ascending thoracic aortic aneurysm (ATAA) is strongly correlated with the aortic stiffness. To validate this assumption, we propose a non-invasive inverse method to identify the patient-specific local extensional stiffness of aortic walls based on gated CT scans. Using these images, the local strain distribution is reconstructed throughout the cardiac cycle. Subsequently, obtained strains are related to tensions, through local equilibrium equations, to estimate the local extensional stiffness at every position. We apply the approach on 11 patients who underwent a gated CT scan before surgical ATAA repair and whose ATAA tissue was tested after the surgical procedure to estimate the rupture risk criterion. We find a very good correlation between the rupture risk criterion and the local extensional stiffness. Finally it is shown that patients can be separated in two groups: a group of stiff and brittle ATAA with a rupture risk criterion above 0.9, and a group of relatively compliant ATAA with a rupture risk below 0.9. Although these results need to be repeated on larger cohorts to impact the clinical practice, they support the paradigm that local aortic stiffness is an important determinant of ATAA rupture risk.",The Effect of Formalin Preservation Time and Temperature on the Material Properties of Bovine Femoral Cortical Bone Tissue.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30671755,Annals of biomedical engineering,2019 03 13,"Literature has reported controversial findings on whether formalin affected bone properties, or not, especially when different preservation time durations and temperatures were involved. Hence, accurately and systematically quantifying the effect of formalin on the mechanical properties of bone using a large dataset is crucial for assessing biomechanical responses based on fixed specimens. A total of 154 longitudinal and 149 transverse cuboid-shaped (12 mm × 2 mm × 0.5 mm) specimens from the midsection of 12 bovine femora from six bovines were prepared and assigned to ten groups, including fresh-frozen, formalin-preserved at 25 °C for 4 weeks and 8 weeks, and formalin-preserved at 4 °C for 4 weeks and 8 weeks. All specimens underwent quasi-static three-point bending tests with a loading rate of 0.02 mm/s. The Young's modulus, yield stress, yield strain, tangent modulus, effective plastic strain, ultimate stress, and toughness were calculated by optimizing the material parameters to make the force-displacement curve of the finite element prediction consistent with the experimental curve, combined with specimen-specific finite element models. Preservation time and temperature both had significant effects on the Young's modulus, yield stress, effective plastic strain, yield strain and ultimate stress of cortical bone (p < 0.05). The Young's modulus, yield stress, and ultimate stress of longitudinal specimens decreased significantly with the increase of preservation time, and the yield strain increased significantly. As the preservation temperature increases, the Young's modulus of the transverse sample decreased significantly, and the yield strain increased significantly. The preservation time mainly affects the longitudinal specimens, while the preservation temperature mainly affects the transverse specimens. Formalin preservation of bovine femoral cortical bones at a lower temperature and less than 4 weeks is recommended for biomechanical testing.",miR-214 is Stretch-Sensitive in Aortic Valve and Inhibits Aortic Valve Calcification.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30671754,Annals of biomedical engineering,2019 06 10,"miR-214 has been recently found to be significantly downregulated in calcified human aortic valves (AVs). ER stress, especially the ATF4-mediated pathway, has also been shown to be significantly upregulated in calcific AV disease. Since elevated cyclic stretch is one of the major mechanical stimuli for AV calcification and ATF4 is a validated target of miR-214, we investigated the effect of cyclic stretch on miR-214 expression as well as those of ATF4 and two downstream genes (CHOP and BCL2L1). Porcine aortic valve (PAV) leaflets were cyclically stretched at 15% for 48 h in regular medium and for 1 week in osteogenic medium to simulate the early remodeling and late calcification stages of stretch-induced AV disease, respectively. For both stages, 10% cyclic stretch served as the physiological counterpart. RT-qPCR revealed that miR-214 expression was significantly downregulated during the late calcification stage, whereas the mRNA expression of ATF4 and BCL2L1 was upregulated and downregulated, respectively, during both early remodeling and late calcification stages. When PAV leaflets were statically transfected with miR-214 mimic in osteogenic medium for 2 weeks, calcification was significantly reduced compared to the control mimic case. This implies that miR-214 may have a protective role in stretch-induced calcific AV disease.",Multi-Scale Modeling of Head Kinematics and Brain Tissue Response to Blast Exposure.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30671753,Annals of biomedical engineering,2019 01 23,"Injuries resulting from blast exposure have been increasingly prevalent in recent conflicts, with a particular focus on the risk of head injury. In the current study, a multibody model (GEBOD) was used to investigate the gross kinematics resulting from blast exposure, including longer duration events such as the fall and ground impact. Additionally, detailed planar head models, in the sagittal and transverse planes, were used to model the primary blast wave interaction with the head, and resulting tissue response. For severe blast load cases (scaled distance less than 2), the translational head accelerations during primary blast were found to increase as the height-of-burst (HOB) was lowered, while the HOB was found to have no effect for cases with scaled distance greater than 2. The HOB was found to affect both the magnitude and direction of rotational accelerations, with increasing magnitudes as the HOB deviated from the height of the head. The choice of ground contact stiffness was found to greatly affect the predicted head accelerations during ground impact. For a medium soil ground material, the kinematics during ground impact were greater for scaled distances exceeding 1.5, below which the primary blast produced greater kinematic head response.",Qualitative Comparative Analysis: A Mixed-Method Tool for Complex Implementation Questions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30671752,The journal of primary prevention,2019 02 19,"The translation and scale-up of evidence-based programs require new methods to guide implementation decisions across varying contexts. As programs are translated to real-world settings, variability is introduced. Some program components may have minor roles to play in producing positive outcomes, and some may have major roles, but only if adapted to meet different contextual demands. While some sources of variability are likely to improve program outcomes, we currently lack methods that allow us to determine the critical components or combinations of components that serve as causal pathways to a desired outcome and then to advise practitioners accordingly. In this paper, we introduce a promising tool for this purpose and illustrate its use in a translational research context. Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) is often used to examine causality in situations that have complex, multiply-determined outcomes. The basic premise of QCA is that different sets of causal conditions, or causal pathways, may lead to a single outcome (the principle of equifinality). We applied QCA to a selection of the highest- and lowest-performing programs from a multi-year two-state dissemination of The Strengthening Families Program for Parents and Adolescents 10-14 to determine which components or combinations of components at the implementation, program delivery, and participant levels produced desired participant outcomes. In particular, we examined which components were necessary (i.e., in the absence of these factors, the outcome didnot occur), and which were sufficient (i.e., in the presence of these factors, the outcome always occurred). Results demonstrated that certain conditions were necessary for program success. In addition, given those necessary conditions, there were two sets of conditions sufficient to produce success, regardless of the presence or absence of any of the others. QCA, not previously used in prevention science research, helps to illuminate causal pathways, leading to concrete, evidence-based implementation decisions that facilitate generalization and scale-up.",A survey of traditional Chinese medicine use among rheumatoid arthritis patients: a claims data-based cohort study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30671749,Clinical rheumatology,2019 05 20,"Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is commonly used for symptom relief in patients with chronic diseases.

This work presents the leaf essential oil composition, mosquito larvicidal activities, and insect-repellent activity of Severinia monophylla. The essential oil of S. monophylla from Vietnam was obtained by hydrodistillation and analyzed by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. The major components were sabinene, β-caryophyllene, bicyclogermacrene, germacrene D, (E)-nerolidol, globulol, and linalool. The leaf essential oil showed remarkable larvicidal activity against Ae. aegypti with LC50 (48 h) of 7.1 μg/mL and Ae. albopictus with LC50 (48 h) of 36 μg/mL. The essential oil also showed repellent activity on T. rubrofasciata at a concentration of 0.5%.","Five years following first detection of Anopheles stephensi (Diptera: Culicidae) in Djibouti, Horn of Africa: populations established-malaria emerging.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30671729,Parasitology research,2019 05 20,"The Asian malaria mosquito, Anopheles stephensi, is a well-known and important vector of Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax. Until 2013, its geographical distribution was confined to central and southern Asia including the Arabian Peninsula. In the Horn of Africa (HoA) Region, An. stephensi was first recorded from Djibouti in 2012, when it was linked geographically and temporally with an unusual outbreak of urban P. falciparum malaria. In 2016, An. stephensi was detected in the neighbouring Somali Region of Ethiopia. In order to determine whether An. stephensi populations have become established in Djibouti and contributed to the unusual rise in local malaria cases there, we carried out continuous vector surveillance from January 2013 to December 2017, investigated seasonal changes in An. stephensi population densities and bionomics, analysed available literature describing malaria in Djibouti since 2013, and investigated whether An. stephensi may have contributed to local malaria transmission by detecting circumsporozoite antigen of P. falciparum and P. vivax in female anophelines. From 2013 to 2016, seasonal activity of An. stephensi in urban Djibouti City primarily occurred during the colder, wetter season between September and May, with either no or rare trap catches from June to August. Unlike past years, this species was detected year-round, including the extremely hot summer months of June to August 2017. This change in seasonal occurrence may indicate that An. stephensi populations are adapting to their new environment in sub-Saharan Africa, facilitating their spread within Djibouti City. Among the 96 female An. stephensi investigated for malaria infectivity, three (3.1%) were positive for P. falciparum circumsporozoite antigen, including one P. falciparum/P. vivax VK 210 double infection. Subsequent to the unusual resurgence of local malaria in 2013, with 1684 confirmed cased reported for that year, malaria case numbers increased continuously, peaking at 14,810 in 2017. Prior to 2016, only P. falciparum malaria cases had been reported, but in 2016, autochthonously acquired P. vivax malaria cases occurred for the first time at a rate of 16.7% among all malaria cases recorded that year. This number increased to 36.7% in 2017. Our data indicate that the dynamics of malaria species in Djibouti is currently changing rapidly, and that An. stephensi can be involved in the transmission of both P. falciparum and P. vivax, simultaneously. Considering the extremely high potential impact of urban malaria on public health, the timely deployment of optimal multinational vector surveillance and control programs against An. stephensi is strongly recommended, not only for the HoA Region, but for the entire African continent.","Gene structure and expression patterns of Acdaf-1, a TGF-β type I receptor in Ancylostoma caninum.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30671728,Parasitology research,2019 05 20,"The components of the transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) signaling pathway in parasitic nematodes remain unknown. In this research, a type I receptor for TGF-β was isolated from the hookworm Ancylostoma caninum. The new gene was designated as Acdaf-1, a Caenorhabditis elegans daf-1 homolog. The full-length cDNA of Acdaf-1 encodes a 595-amino-acid protein with an NH2-terminal signal peptide. This protein has a cytoplasm tail (209-595aa region) which corresponds to the type 1a membrane topology. Between amino acid position 295-500, the protein contains the ATP binding site, substrate binding sites, and PKC-kinase-like domain. Real-time RT-PCR showed that the transcript was expressed in three main stages of A. caninum. It reached the maximal level in the female adult worm stage with lower transcript level in the first and second larvae (L1/L2) and intermediate level in L3 stages as well as in the male worms. After serum activation, the activity of Acdaf-1 was decreased in L3 larvae. These data implied that Acdaf-1 might relate to the infection ability of the larvae. Immunolocalization revealed that AcDAF-1 was present in eggs, intestine, and epidermis cells of larvae (L1, L2, and L3 stages) with strong signal in primordium of the gonads in L3 and was abundant in epidermis, intestine, and ovary of adult worm. These results suggested that Acdaf-1 might be involved in the interaction of the parasite and host relationship and provide a potential target for parasite control.",Health utilities and parental quality of life effects for three rare conditions tested in newborns.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30671727,Journal of patient-reported outcomes,2019 02 08,"Measurement of health utilities is required for economic evaluations.

In this overview, which is based on a presentation made at the Flip the Script: Understanding African American Women's Resilience in the Face of Allostatic Load meeting at Ohio State University in August 2018, we build upon previous reviews by discussing four key aspects of allostatic load, specifically its: (1) importance, (2) operationalization, (3) use in minority health and health disparities research, and (4) value in such research. Operationalized in various ways, allostatic load is composed of 10 original markers and additional markers deriving from research among minority and disparity populations. The markers represent four biological systems: (1) cardiovascular, (2) metabolic, (3) inflammatory, and (4) neuroendocrine. System-specific racial/ethnic and sex-based differences have been observed. An overall score can be determined using sample-generated or empirically derived clinically relevant cut points.

The changes are induced by chemical species coming from industrial waste, which interacts with rocks and minerals. These trigger agents (phosphorus and nitrogen nutrients) which can incorporate trace elements (As, Fe, Mn, Pb, Cd, Ni, Zn). The main objective of the present work was to study the phosphate ions' and nitrogenous species' effects on the incorporation of trace elements into groundwater used for human consumption and to determine the physicochemical processes that participate in the incorporation of trace elements. The physicochemical analysis and elemental analysis by ICP of the groundwater that supplies the study area showed that the phosphorus (P) activity contributes in the incorporation of trace elements into the water. Significant correlations between the activities of P and Fe (0.516), Mn (0.553), Pb (0.756), and As (- 0.747) as well as the correlation of NH4+ with As indicate that the presence of chemical species such as PO43- (2.50-32.20 mg L-1), NO3- (0.89-30.80 mg L-1), and NH4+ (0.2-12.70 mg L-1) are triggering agents that favor the dissolution and mobility of As (0.014-0.020 mg L-1), Fe (0.020-1.14 mg L-1), Mn (0.007-0.254 mg L-1), Ni (0.002-0.0141 mg L-1), Zn (0.009-0.459 mg L-1), and Pb (0.009-0.0170 mg L-1), species with adverse health effects because they are considered carcinogenic.

More recently, low-cost sensors have been used to collect high-resolution spatial and temporal air pollution data in real-time. In this paper, for the first time, Envirowatch E-MOTEs are employed for air quality monitoring as a case study in Sheffield. Ten E-MOTEs were deployed for a year (October 2016 to September 2017) monitoring several air pollutants (NO, NO2, CO) and meteorological parameters. Their performance was compared to each other and to a reference instrument installed nearby. E-MOTEs were able to successfully capture the temporal variability such as diurnal, weekly and annual cycles in air pollutant concentrations and demonstrated significant similarity with reference instruments. NO2 concentrations showed very strong positive correlation between various sensors. Mostly, correlation coefficients (r values) were greater than 0.92. CO from different sensors also had r values mostly greater than 0.92; however, NO showed r value less than 0.5. Furthermore, several multiple linear regression models (MLRM) and generalised additive models (GAM) were developed to calibrate the E-MOTE data and reproduce NO and NO2 concentrations measured by the reference instruments. GAMs demonstrated significantly better performance than linear models by capturing the non-linear association between the response and explanatory variables. The best GAM developed for reproducing NO2 concentrations returned values of 0.95, 3.91, 0.81, 0.005 and 0.61 for factor of two (FAC2), root mean square error (RMSE), coefficient of determination (R2), normalised mean biased (NMB) and coefficient of efficiency (COE), respectively.

Interestingly, the embryos with a high amount of PGCs mainly developed into females and the ones with a low amount of PGCs mainly developed into males. By using transient overexpression and transgenic induction of PGC-specific bucky ball (buc), we further proved that induction of abundant PGCs at embryonic stage promoted later ovary differentiation and female development. Taken together, we generate an ideal transgenic line Tg(piwil1:egfp-UTRnanos3)ihb327Tg which can visualize zebrafish germline for a lifetime, and we have utilized this line to study germ cell development and gonad differentiation of teleost and to demonstrate that the increase of PGC number at embryonic stage promotes female differentiation.",Region-specific changes in brain kisspeptin receptor expression during estrogen depletion and the estrous cycle.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30671658,Histochemistry and cell biology,2019 01 23,"Kisspeptin acts as a potent neuropeptide regulator of reproduction through modulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. Previous studies revealed sex differences in brain expression patterns as well as regulation of expression by estrogen. Alternatively, sex differences and estrogen regulation of the kisspeptin receptor (encoded by Kiss1r) have not been examined at cellular resolution. In the current study, we examined whether Kiss1r mRNA expression also exhibits estrogen sensitivity and sex-dependent differences using in situ hybridization. We compared Kiss1r mRNA expression between ovariectomized (OVX) rats and estradiol (E2)-replenished OVX rats to examine estrogen sensitivity, and compared expression between gonadally intact male rats and female rats in diestrus or proestrus to examine sex differences. In OVX rats, E2 replenishment significantly reduced Kiss1r expression specifically in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (ARC). A difference in Kiss1r expression was also observed between diestrus and proestrus rats in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN), but not in the ARC. Thus, estrogen appears to have region- and context-specific effects on Kiss1r expression. However, immunostaining revealed minimal colocalization of estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) in Kiss1r-expressing neuronal populations of ARC and PVN, indicating indirect or ERα-independent regulation of Kiss1r expression. Surprisingly, unlike the kisspeptin ligand, no sexual dimorphisms were observed in either the brain distribution of Kiss1r expression or in the number of Kiss1r-expressing neurons within enriched brain nuclei. The current study reveals marked differences in regulation between kisspeptin and kisspeptin receptor, and provides an essential foundation for further study of kisspeptin signaling and function in reproduction.",Value of ultrasound biomicroscopy in assessment of small masses at medial canthal region.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30671657,Graefe's archive for clinical and experimental ophthalmology = Albrecht von Graefes Archiv fur klinische und experimentelle Ophthalmologie,2019 04 12,Conventional imaging techniques are not sensitive enough to reveal detailed structures of lacrimal drainage system (LDS) and its surrounding tissue (ST).

Meristems are undifferentiated cells responsible for post-embryonic plant development. The meristems are able to form new organs continuously by carefully balancing between stem cell proliferation and cell differentiation. The plant stem cell niche in each meristem harbors the stem cells that are important to maintain each meristem. The shoot apical meristem (SAM) produces all above-parts of a plant and the molecular mechanisms active in the SAM are actively studied since many years, and models are available. During the reproductive phase of the plant, the inflorescence meristem gives rise to floral meristems, which give rise to the flowers. During floral development, the gynoecium forms that contains a new meristem inside, called the carpel margin meristem (CMM). In Arabidopsis, the gynoecium consists out of two fused carpels, where the CMM forms along the fused carpel margins. In this review, we focus on the molecular mechanisms taking place in the CMM, and we discuss similarities and differences found in the SAM.",Correction to: Assessment of natural radioactivity in coals and coal combustion residues from a coal-based thermoelectric plant in Bangladesh: implications for radiological health hazards.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30671643,Environmental monitoring and assessment,2019 01 30,The original version of this article unfortunately contained an error in eq. 1.

The hypothesis was RV free wall strain measured using speckle-tracking echocardiography might be a powerful prognostic factor in those patients. We aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of echocardiographic measurements of RV systolic function for clinical outcomes and to assess the correlation between the echocardiographic RV function parameters in patients with acute non-massive PE. Between November 2013 and September 2016, 144 consecutive patients diagnosed as acute non-massive pulmonary embolism were prospectively enrolled and echocardiographic evaluations were performed within 1 week of diagnosis to measure various parameters of RV systolic function. The primary endpoint was in-hospital events, the composite of in-hospital PE-related death, need of additive treatments such as thrombolysis or pulmonary artery thromboembolectomy, and need of inotropics due to unstable vital sign. Among patients (mean age 60.3 ± 14.7 years, 50% female) with acute non-massive PE, the in-hospital event rate was 11.1% (16 of 144 patients). In multivariate logistic regression analysis, after adjustment of confounding factors such as age, gender, and diabetes mellitus, RV free wall strain [odd ratio (OR) 1.12, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.04-1.21, p = 0.002] and RV global wall strain (OR 1.20, 95% CI 1.07-1.35, p = 0.002) were independent predictors for in-hospital events. The event rates were significantly different between groups classified based on RV free wall strain with cut-off value of - 15.85% (p < 0.001). RV strain assessed with speckle-tracking echocardiography is an independent prognostic marker for in-hospital events in patients with acute non-massive PE.

Thirty New Zealand white rabbits were randomly divided into three groups: control group (n = 10), restenosis group (n = 10), and Telmisartan group (n = 10). The restenosis model was established by high-cholesterol diet combined with double-balloon injury of iliac arteries. In addition, Telmisartan at 5 mg/(kg day) was administered to the rabbits of Telmisartan group on the second day after the second balloon injury. All rabbits were killed at the end of the experiment followed by institution policy. Before sacrifice, blood samples were obtained to test serum angiotensinII (AngII). Iliac arteries were isolated for morphological analysis and determining the expression of Cx43 by HE staining, immunohistochemical analysis, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and Western Blotting analysis. Then, the local AngII levels of arteries were measured by radioimmunoassay. As compared with controls, the expression of Cx43 mRNA (0.98 ± 0.08) vs. (1.27 ± 0.17), P < 0.01), and Cx43 protein [(0.75 ± 0.08) vs. (0.90 ± 0.08), P < 0.05] of restenosis group were increased, which were significantly higher than those of Telmisartan group [Cx43 mRNA: (1.27 ± 0.17) vs. (1.00 ± 0.20), P < 0.01; Cx43 protein: (0.90 ± 0.08) vs. (0.82 ± 0.05), P < 0.05].

Telmisartan group exhibited thinner intima compared with restenosis group [(68.22 ± 24.37) vs. (266.12 ± 70.27), P < 0.01]. However, the local AngII levels between these two groups were approximate. In addition, the plasma concentration of AngII was not significantly different among three groups.

CPP measurements were performed in 1348 patients with STEMI (327 women; mean age 62.5 ± 12.1 years) undergoing PPCI. Aortic systolic and diastolic blood pressure was measured before intervention. The primary outcome was 8-year all-cause mortality. The median [25-75th percentile] CPP value was 55.0 [43.0-70.0] mmHg. CPP correlated negatively with heart rate (P < 0.001), body mass index (P = 0.007), Killip class (P < 0.001) and initial area at risk (P < 0.001) and positively with age (P < 0.001), female sex (P < 0.001), diabetes (P = 0.012), arterial hypertension (P < 0.001) and glomerular filtration rate (P = 0.004).

Tulip is one of the most important ornamental bulbous plants in the world. A precious precooling treatment during bulb postharvest is required for optimal floral stalk elongation and flower development in tulip. In this study, the naturally growing and flowering variations of tulip to storage temperatures were analyzed after long-term cold (LTC) and short-term cold (STC) treatments. Three cultivars were screened out with successful blooming after STC, which included 'Dow Jones' (DJ), 'Van Eijk' (VE) and 'World's Favourite' (WF) (5 °C for 2 weeks). Comparative analysis revealed that DJ cultivar maintained normal and intact reproductive organs under STC condition, while the 'Orange Emperor' (OE) cultivar, which failed blooming after STC treatment, showed gradually destroyed reproductive organs under STC condition. In addition, the DJ cultivar accumulated lower ROS levels and higher antioxidant enzyme activities, as well as significantly higher contents of total primary metabolites than OE to maintain normal shoot growth and floral organ development under STC condition. The relative expression levels of genes involved in vernalization and/or flower time regulation in DJ were significantly higher than those in OE after STC treatment. This study provides new insights into understanding the underlying mechanism of natural variation of tulip cultivars during postharvest storage treatment.",The Effect of Lipid Antioxidant α-Tocopherol on Cell Viability and Electrofusion Yield of B16-F1 Cells In Vitro.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30671620,The Journal of membrane biology,2019 02 13,"Induced cell fusion is a powerful method for production of hybridoma in biotechnology and cell vaccines in medical applications. Among different alternatives, physical methods have an advantage, as they do not require any additives. Among them electrofusion, an electroporation-based cell fusion method holds a great promise. Electric pulses cause cell membrane permeabilization and due to pore formation bring cell membrane into the fusogenic state. At the same time, however, they compromise cell viability. We used a train of 8 × 100 µs electric pulses, delivered at 1 Hz with strengths ranging from 400 to 1600 V/cm. We evaluated electrofusion efficiency by dual color microscopy. We determined cell viability, because during electroporation reactive oxygen species are generated affecting cell survival. The novelty of our study is evaluation of the effect of lipid antioxidant α-tocopherol on cell fusion yield and cell viability on mouse B16-F1 cells. Pretreatment with α-tocopherol slowed down dynamic of cell fusion shortly after electroporation. Twenty-four hours later, fusion yields between α-tocopherol treated and untreated cells were comparable. The viability of α-tocopherol pretreated cells was drastically improved. Pretreatment of cells with α-tocopherol improved whole electrofusion process by more than 60%. We believe that α-tocopherol holds great promise to become an important agent to improve cell electrofusion method.",Impacts of global warming on confined livestock systems for growing-fattening pigs: simulation of heat stress for 1981 to 2017 in Central Europe.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30671619,International journal of biometeorology,2019 02 28,"In the mid-latitudes, pigs and poultry are kept predominantly in confined livestock buildings with a mechanical ventilation system. In the last decades, global warming has already been a challenge which causes hat stress for animals in such systems. Heat stress inside livestock buildings was assessed by a simulation model for the indoor climate, which is driven by meteorological parameters. Besides the meteorological conditions, the thermal environment inside the building depends on the sensible and latent energy release of the animals, the thermal properties of the building and the ventilation system and its control unit. For a site in Austria in the north of the Alpine Ridge, which is representative for confined livestock buildings for growing-fattening pigs in Central Europe, meteorological data between 1981 and 2017 were used for the model calculations of heat stress measures. This business-as-usual simulation over these 37 years resulted in an increase of the mean relative annual heat stress parameters in the range between 0.9 and 6.4% per year since 1981. In order to minimise the negative economic impact as the consequence of this positive trend of heat stress, adaptation measures are needed. The calculations for growing-fattening pigs show that such a simulation model for the indoor climate is an appropriate tool to determine the level of heat stress of livestock inside confined livestock buildings.",Evaluation of 3D fat-navigator based retrospective motion correction in the clinical setting of patients with brain tumors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30671618,Neuroradiology,2019 04 29,A 3D fat-navigator (3D FatNavs)-based retrospective motion correction is an elegant approach to correct for motion as it requires no additional hardware and can be acquired during existing 'dead-time' within common 3D protocols.

Significant correlations were observed between soil Se and plant biomass Se, but not between soil Cd and plant biomass Cd. High concentrations of Cd were detected in rice plants and particularly in rice grains, suggesting potential health risks to human. Contrary to results from other previous studies, our results showed that high soil Se did not reduce Cd uptake by rice, although it decreased the availability of Cd in soil. Rather, soil Se and internal Se pool in rice were positively correlated to the transfer of Cd from root to straw. The effect of Se on the uptake and translocation of Cd in rice in field is therefore different from those in pot experiments.",New trends in cannabis potency in USA and Europe during the last decade (2008-2017).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30671616,European archives of psychiatry and clinical neuroscience,2019 06 10,"Through the potency monitoring program at the University of Mississippi supported by National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), a total of 18108 samples of cannabis preparations have been analyzed over the last decade, using a validated GC/FID method. The samples are classified as sinsemilla, marijuana, ditchweed, hashish, and hash oil (now referred to as cannabis concentrate). The number of samples received over the last 5 years has decreased dramatically due to the legalization of marijuana either for medical or for recreational purposes in many US states. The results showed that the mean Δ9-THC concentration has increased dramatically over the last 10 years, from 8.9% in 2008 to 17.1% in 2017. The mean Δ9-THC:CBD ratio also rose substantially from 23 in 2008 to 104 in 2017. There was also marked increase in the proportion of hash oil samples (concentrates) seized (0.5-4.7%) and their mean Δ9-THC concentration (6.7-55.7%) from 2008 to 2017. Other potency monitoring programs are also present in several European countries such as The Netherlands, United Kingdom, France, and Italy. These programs have also documented increases in Δ9-THC concentrations and Δ9-THC:CBD ratios in cannabis. These trends in the last decade suggest that cannabis is becoming an increasingly harmful product in the USA and Europe.",Inducing spontaneous future thoughts in younger and older adults by priming future-oriented personal goals.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30671615,Psychological research,2019 06 10,"In the past 15 years, the study of spontaneous thoughts (i.e., thoughts coming to mind without intention and effort) has received increased attention. Spontaneous future thoughts (SFTs) are particularly important (e.g., in planning), yet difficult to study with regard to age differences. Two main problems arise: (1) lab tasks including word-cues induce more past than future thoughts; (2) younger adults report more spontaneous thoughts than older adults. To improve the elicitation of SFTs, we developed a future-oriented goal-related priming procedure and analyzed the extension of the goal-related priming effect in SFTs to older adults, to examine whether age-related changes in personal goals compromise the elicitation of SFTs. We also controlled for methodological factors that could influence age groups differently (including demand, retrospection, meta-awareness and instruction bias). Twenty-seven younger and 27 older adults performed a low-demand vigilance task including word-cues and were periodically stopped to describe their thoughts. The vigilance task was divided into two parts and, between them, participants performed a future-oriented goal-related priming task. An additional group of 27 younger participants performed the same procedure with a control task based on word counting. We found a significant increase in SFTs after priming in both age groups, but not in the control group, indicating that the priming manipulation was effective. This result suggests that age-related changes in personal goals do not disrupt the relation between personal goals and SFT frequency. The similar pattern of overall spontaneous thought in both age groups is also discussed considering methodological factors.","Prognostic value of tumour-infiltrating CD8+ lymphocytes in rectal cancer after neoadjuvant chemoradiation: is indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO1) a friend or foe?",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30671614,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",2019 04 16,"The prognostic value of the local immune phenotype in patients with colorectal cancer has been extensively studied. Neoadjuvant radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy may potentially influence these immune responses. In this study, we examined the prognostic role of indoleamine-2,3-Dioxygenase (IDO1) and infiltrating cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CD8+) in locally advanced rectal carcinomas after neoadjuvant treatment. Expression of IDO1 and CD8 was evaluated by immunohistochemistry in 106 archival tumour tissue samples from patients following neoadjuvant chemoradiation and radical resection. The average infiltration of IDO1+ and CD8+ cells was calculated along the tumour invasive front, in the tumour centre and within the neoplastic cells and expressed as total scores. Of the tumour specimens evaluable for immunohistochemistry, 100% showed CD8+ lymphocyte infiltration and 93.4% stained positive for IDO1. Total IDO1 score positively correlated with total CD8 score for all three subsites (p = 0.002, Kendall-tau-b 0.357). A high total CD8 score was positively correlated with lower ypUICC-stages (p = 0.047) and lower ypT-categories (p = 0.032). Total IDO1 expression showed a clear trend towards a lower risk of recurrence (p = 0.078). A high total IDO1 score was an independent prognostic marker for prolonged disease-free survival (HR 0.38, p = 0.046) and a high total CD8 score for favourable overall survival (HR 0.16, p = 0.029). Analysis of the local CD8 and IDO1 expression profile may be a helpful tool in predicting prognosis for patients with locally advanced rectal cancer following neoadjuvant chemoradiation.",β-Lapachone protects against doxorubicin-induced nephrotoxicity via NAD+/AMPK/NF-kB in mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30671613,Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's archives of pharmacology,2019 04 19,"β-Lapachone (B-LAP) is a natural naphtaquinone with established anti-oxidative stress and anti-cancer activities. We aimed to investigate B-LAP protective potential against doxorubicin (DOX)-induced nephrotoxicity in mice. The mice received an oral dose of B-LAP followed by a single intraperitoneal injection of 20 mg/kg DOX a day later. They were then treated for 4 days with 1.25 mg/kg, 2.5 mg/kg, and 5 mg/kg doses of B-LAP. Renal levels of NAD+/NADH ratios, p-AMPKα, p-NF-κB p65, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin 6 (IL-6) along with renal expressions of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 were examined. Serum levels of kidney function markers as well as renal histopathology were also investigated. In addition to increasing the activities of p-AMPKα, B-LAP elevated NAD+/NADH ratios in the kidneys and decreased the renal levels of nuclear p-NF-κB and its correspondent downstream effectors TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and iNOS in the kidneys. Also, B-LAP effectively ameliorated renal architectural changes and attenuated serum levels of urea, creatinine, and cystatin C. Collectively, these findings suggest the protective actions of B-LAP against DOX-induced nephrotoxicity in mice."
