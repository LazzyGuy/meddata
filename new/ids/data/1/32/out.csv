Here, we performed deep sequencing analyses of the viral genome to explore genetic variations of HPV16 that are prevalent in Japan. A total of 100 complete genome sequences of HPV16 were determined from cervical specimens collected from Japanese women with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and invasive cervical cancer, or without cervical malignancies. Phylogenetic analyses revealed the variant distribution in the Japanese HPV16 isolates; overall, lineage A was the most prevalent (94.0%), in which sublineage A4 was dominant (52.0%), followed by sublineage A1 (21.0%). The relative risk of sublineage A4 for cervical cancer development was significantly higher compared to sublineages A1/A2/A3 (odds ratio = 6.72, 95% confidence interval = 1.78-28.9). Interestingly, a novel cluster of variants that branched from A1/A2/A3 was observed for the Japanese HPV16 isolates, indicating that unique HPV16 variants are prevalent among Japanese women.","The Potential Environmental Impact of PAHs on Soil and Water Resources in Air Deposited Coal Refuse Sites in Niangziguan Karst Catchment, Northern China.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995758,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 06 10,"Long-term deposition of coal spoil piles may lead to serious pollution of soil and water resources in the dumping sites and surrounding areas. Karst aquifers are highly sensitive to environmental pollution. In this study, the occurrence and release/mobilization of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in coal waste and coal spoils fire gas mineral (CSFGM) were evaluated by field and indoor investigations at Yangquan city, one of the major coal mining districts in the karst areas of northern China. Field investigations showed that dumping of coal waste over decades has resulted in soil and water pollution via spontaneous combustion and leaching of coal spoil piles. Indoor analysis revealed that the 2-ring and 3-ring PAHs contribute to 65-80% of the total PAHs in coal spoils, with naphthalene (Nap), Chrysene (Chr), and Phenanthrene (Phe) as the dominant compounds. Based on a heating/burning simulation experiment, the production of PAHs is temperature-dependent and mainly consists of low-ring PAHs: 2-ring, 3-ring, and part of the 4-ring PAHs. The PAHs in the leachate are light-PAHs (Nap, 20.06 ng/L; Phe, 4.76 ng/L) with few heavy-PAHs. The distribution modes of PAHs in two soil profiles suggest that the precipitation caused downward movement of PAHs and higher mobility of light-PAHs.",Clinical and Biological Significance of ESR1 Gene Alteration and Estrogen Receptors Isoforms Expression in Breast Cancer Patients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995757,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 06 10,"The amplification of estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) encoded by the ESR1 gene has been described as having a prognostic role in breast cancer patients. However, increased dosage of the ESR1 gene (tested by real-time PCR) is also observed in ER-negative breast cancers, which might suggest the expression of alternative isoforms of ERα (other than classical ERα of 66 kDa). In the current work, we have investigated the ESR1 gene dosage in 402 primary breast cancer patients as well as the expression of ERα isoforms-ERα66 and ERα36-on mRNA and protein levels. The obtained results were correlated with clinicopathological data of the patients. Results showed that increased ESR1 gene dosage is not related to ESR1 gene amplification measured by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), but it correlates with the decreased expression of ERα66 isoform (p = 0.01). Interestingly, the short ER isoform ERα36 was expressed in samples with increased ESR1 gene dosage, suggesting that genomic aberration might influence the expression of that particular isoform. Similarly to ESR1 increased gene dosage, high ERα36 expression was linked with the decreased disease-free survival of the patients (p = 0.05), which was independent of the status of the classical ERα66 level in breast tumors.",Mycotoxins during the Processes of Nixtamalization and Tortilla Production.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995755,Toxins,2019 06 10,"Tortillas are a traditional staple food in Mesoamerican cuisine, which have also become popular on a global level, e.g., for wraps or as snacks (tortilla chips). Traditional tortilla production includes alkaline cooking (nixtamalization) of maize kernels. This article summarizes the current knowledge on mycotoxin changes during the nixtamalization of maize and tortilla production. Upon nixtamalization, mycotoxins can be affected in different ways. On the one hand, the toxins can be physically removed during steeping and washing. On the other hand, mycotoxins might be degraded, modified, or released/bound in the matrix by high pH and/or high temperature. This also applies to the subsequent baking of tortillas. Many studies have shown reduced mycotoxin levels in alkali-cooked maize and in tortillas. Most of the available data relate to aflatoxins and fumonisins. The reduction (and detoxification) of aflatoxins during nixtamalization might, however, be partially reversed in acidic conditions. The loss of fumonisin concentrations is to some extent accompanied by hydrolyzation and by lower toxicity. However, some studies have indicated the potential formation of toxicologically relevant modified forms and matrix-associated fumonisins. More data are required to assess the influence of alkaline cooking regarding such modified forms, as well as mycotoxins other than aflatoxins/fumonisins.",Evaluating Maize Genotype Performance under Low Nitrogen Conditions Using RGB UAV Phenotyping Techniques.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995754,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 10,"Maize is the most cultivated cereal in Africa in terms of land area and production, but low soil nitrogen availability often constrains yields. Developing new maize varieties with high and reliable yields using traditional crop breeding techniques in field conditions can be slow and costly. Remote sensing has become an important tool in the modernization of field-based high-throughput plant phenotyping (HTPP), providing faster gains towards the improvement of yield potential and adaptation to abiotic and biotic limiting conditions. We evaluated the performance of a set of remote sensing indices derived from red-green-blue (RGB) images along with field-based multispectral normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and leaf chlorophyll content (SPAD values) as phenotypic traits for assessing maize performance under managed low-nitrogen conditions. HTPP measurements were conducted from the ground and from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). For the ground-level RGB indices, the strongest correlations to yield were observed with hue, greener green area (GGA), and a newly developed RGB HTPP index, NDLab (normalized difference Commission Internationale de I´Edairage (CIE)Lab index), while GGA and crop senescence index (CSI) correlated better with grain yield from the UAV. Regarding ground sensors, SPAD exhibited the closest correlation with grain yield, notably increasing in its correlation when measured in the vegetative stage. Additionally, we evaluated how different HTPP indices contributed to the explanation of yield in combination with agronomic data, such as anthesis silking interval (ASI), anthesis date (AD), and plant height (PH). Multivariate regression models, including RGB indices (R2 > 0.60), outperformed other models using only agronomic parameters or field sensors (R2 > 0.50), reinforcing RGB HTPP's potential to improve yield assessments. Finally, we compared the low-N results to the same panel of 64 maize genotypes grown under optimal conditions, noting that only 11% of the total genotypes appeared in the highest yield producing quartile for both trials. Furthermore, we calculated the grain yield loss index (GYLI) for each genotype, which showed a large range of variability, suggesting that low-N performance is not necessarily exclusive of high productivity in optimal conditions.",Laccase Immobilized onto Zirconia⁻Silica Hybrid Doped with Cu2+ as an Effective Biocatalytic System for Decolorization of Dyes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995753,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 10,"Nowadays, novel and advanced methods are being sought to efficiently remove dyes from wastewaters. These compounds, which mainly originate from the textile industry, may adversely affect the aquatic environment as well as living organisms. Thus, in presented study, the synthesized ZrO2-SiO2 and Cu2+-doped ZrO2-SiO2 oxide materials were used for the first time as supports for laccase immobilization, which was carried out for 1 h, at pH 5 and 25 °C. The materials were thoroughly characterized before and after laccase immobilization with respect to electrokinetic stability, parameters of the porous structure, morphology and type of surface functional groups. Additionally, the immobilization yields were defined, which reached 86% and 94% for ZrO2-SiO2-laccase and ZrO2-SiO2/Cu2+-laccase, respectively. Furthermore, the obtained biocatalytic systems were used for enzymatic decolorization of the Remazol Brilliant Blue R (RBBR) dye from model aqueous solutions, under various reaction conditions (time, temperature, pH). The best conditions of the decolorization process (24 h, 30 °C and pH = 4) allowed to achieve the highest decolorization efficiencies of 98% and 90% for ZrO2-SiO2-laccase and ZrO2-SiO2/Cu2+-laccase, respectively. Finally, it was established that the mortality of Artemia salina in solutions after enzymatic decolorization was lower by approx. 20% and 30% for ZrO2-SiO2-laccase and ZrO2-SiO2/Cu2+-laccase, respectively, as compared to the solution before enzymatic treatment, which indicated lower toxicity of the solution. Thus, it should be clearly stated that doping of the oxide support with copper ions positively affects enzyme stability, activity and, in consequence, the removal efficiency of the RBBR dye.",Effect of Solution Composition Variables on Electrospun Alginate Nanofibers: Response Surface Analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995752,Polymers,2019 06 10,"Alginate is a promising biocompatible and biodegradable polymer for production of nanofibers for drug delivery and tissue engineering. However, alginate is difficult to electrospin due to its polyelectrolyte nature. The aim was to improve the 'electrospinability' of alginate with addition of exceptionally high molecular weight poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) as a co-polymer. The compositions of the polymer-blend solutions for electrospinning were varied for PEO molecular weight, total (alginate plus PEO) polymer concentration, and PEO proportion in the dry alginate-PEO polymer mix used. These were tested for rheology (viscosity, complex viscosity, storage and loss moduli) and conductivity, and the electrospun nanofibers were characterized by scanning electron microscopy. One-parameter-at-a-time approach and response surface methodology (RSM) were used to optimize the polymer-blend solution composition to obtain defined nanofibers. Both approaches revealed that the major influence on nanofiber formation and diameter were total polymer concentration and PEO proportion. These polymer-blend solutions of appropriate conductivity and viscosity enabled fine-tuning of nanofiber diameter. PEO molecular weight of 2-4 million Da greatly improved the electrospinnability of alginate, producing nanofibers with >85% alginate. This study shows that RSM can be used to design nanofibers with optimal alginate and co-polymer contents to provide efficient scaffold material for regenerative medicine.","Intracellular and Extracellular Metabolites from the Cyanobacterium Chlorogloeopsis fritschii, PCC 6912, During 48 Hours of UV-B Exposure.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995751,Metabolites,2019 06 10,"Cyanobacteria have many defence strategies to overcome harmful ultraviolet (UV) stress including the production of secondary metabolites. Metabolomics can be used to investigate this altered metabolism via targeted and untargeted techniques. In this study we assessed the changes in the intra- and extracellular low molecular weight metabolite levels of Chlorogloeopsis fritschii (C. fritschii) during 48 h of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) supplemented with UV-B (15 µmol m-2 s-1 of PAR plus 3 µmol m-2 s-1 of UV-B) and intracellular levels during 48 h of PAR only (15 µmol m-2 s-1) with sampling points at 0, 2, 6, 12, 24 and 48 h. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was used as a metabolite profiling tool to investigate the global changes in metabolite levels. The UV-B time series experiment showed an overall significant reduction in intracellular metabolites involved with carbon and nitrogen metabolism such as the amino acids tyrosine and phenylalanine which have a role in secondary metabolite production. Significant accumulation of proline was observed with a potential role in stress mitigation as seen in other photosynthetic organisms. 12 commonly identified metabolites were measured in both UV-B exposed (PAR + UV-B) and PAR only experiments with differences in significance observed. Extracellular metabolites (PAR + UV-B) showed accumulation of sugars as seen in other cyanobacterial species as a stress response to UV-B. In conclusion, a snapshot of the metabolome of C. fritschii was measured. Little work has been undertaken on C. fritschii, a novel candidate for use in industrial biotechnology, with, to our knowledge, no previous literature on combined intra- and extracellular analysis during a UV-B treatment time-series. This study is important to build on experimental data already available for cyanobacteria and other photosynthetic organisms exposed to UV-B.",Prevalence of Noise-Induced Hearing Loss Among Tanzanian Iron and Steel Workers: A Cross-Sectional Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995750,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 06 10,"Iron and steel factory workers in Tanzania are likely to develop noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) due to exposure to high sound levels. Studies on hearing status in this population are lacking. The aims of this study were to determine prevalence of NIHL among iron and steel workers and compare hearing thresholds at different frequencies with a control group. We conducted a cross-sectional study among 221 iron and steel workers exposed to average noise level of 92 dB(A), compared with 107 primary school teachers recruited as controls and exposed to average noise level of 79.7 dB(A). We used a questionnaire-based interview to collect information on socio demographic characteristics and other confounding variables. Hearing loss was defined as hearing threshold levels ≥25 dB hearing loss in either ear at 3000, 4000 or 6000 Hz. The prevalence of hearing loss was significantly higher among the exposed group than among the controls, i.e. 48% and 31%, respectively. There were significant differences in hearing thresholds between the exposed and control groups at 3000, 4000, 6000, and 8000 Hz. Hearing loss was more frequent among workers exposed to higher noise levels than among the controls suggesting that iron and steel workers run a higher risk of developing hearing loss.",Hymenoptera Complex Associated with Myzus persicae and Hyalopterus spp. in Peach Orchards in Northeastern Spain and Prospects for Biological Control of Aphids.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995749,Insects,2019 06 10,"Aphids are a serious pest for peach crops. They have traditionally been managed with insecticides, but there is increasing concern about the risk that insecticides pose to both humans and the environment. As a first step to use biological control in aphid management, we conducted a 3-year field survey in northeastern Spain to determine which parasitoids and hyperparasitoids were most prevalent on two aphids, Myzus persicae (Sulzer) and Hyalopterus spp. Koch, the most harmful to peach trees. We collected 11 parasitoid species from M. persicae, with Aphidius matricariae (Haliday) being the most abundant. Two parasitoid species were also collected from Hyalopterus spp., Aphidius transcaspicus Telenga and Praon volucre (Haliday). Hyperparasitoid species overlapped between these aphids but their relative abundances differed. We also discuss the possible impacts of hyperparasitoids on parasitoid populations. Our results suggest that it would be feasible to implement biocontrol methods for aphids in integrated pest management programmes in peach orchards. There are a number of primary parasitoid species associated with these aphids, and the nearby crops and wild vegetation in the vicinity and within the orchards may provide a suitable habitat for them. Additionally, some of them are commercially available and might be usable in augmentative releases."

Despite an increasing worldwide prevalence of ASD, there is currently no pharmacological cure to treat core symptoms of ASD. Clinical evidence and molecular data support the role of impaired mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation (FAO) in ASD. The recognition of defects in energy metabolism in ASD may be important for better understanding ASD and developing therapeutic intervention. The nuclear peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR) α, δ, and γ are ligand-activated receptors with distinct physiological functions in regulating lipid and glucose metabolism, as well as inflammatory response. PPAR activation allows a coordinated up-regulation of numerous FAO enzymes, resulting in significant PPAR-driven increases in mitochondrial FAO flux. Resveratrol (RSV) is a polyphenolic compound which exhibits metabolic, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory properties, pointing to possible applications in ASD therapeutics. In this study, we review the evidence for the existing links between ASD and impaired mitochondrial FAO and review the potential implications for regulation of mitochondrial FAO in ASD by PPAR activators, including RSV.","TRPM7, Magnesium, and Signaling.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995736,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 06 10,"The transient receptor potential melastatin-subfamily member 7 (TRPM7) is a ubiquitously expressed chanzyme that possesses an ion channel permeable to the divalent cations Mg2+, Ca2+, and Zn2+, and an α-kinase that phosphorylates downstream substrates. TRPM7 and its homologue TRPM6 have been implicated in a variety of cellular functions and is critically associated with intracellular signaling, including receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)-mediated pathways. Emerging evidence indicates that growth factors, such as EGF and VEGF, signal through their RTKs, which regulate activity of TRPM6 and TRPM7. TRPM6 is primarily an epithelial-associated channel, while TRPM7 is more ubiquitous. In this review we focus on TRPM7 and its association with growth factors, RTKs, and downstream kinase signaling. We also highlight how interplay between TRPM7, Mg2+ and signaling kinases influences cell function in physiological and pathological conditions, such as cancer and preeclampsia.",Highly Porous Organic Polymers for Hydrogen Fuel Storage.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995735,Polymers,2019 06 10,"Hydrogen (H2) is one of the best candidates to replace current petroleum energy resources due to its rich abundance and clean combustion. However, the storage of H2 presents a major challenge. There are two methods for storing H2 fuel, chemical and physical, both of which have some advantages and disadvantages. In physical storage, highly porous organic polymers are of particular interest, since they are low cost, easy to scale up, metal-free, and environmentally friendly. In this review, highly porous polymers for H2 fuel storage are examined from five perspectives: (a) brief comparison of H2 storage in highly porous polymers and other storage media; (b) theoretical considerations of the physical storage of H2 molecules in porous polymers; (c) H2 storage in different classes of highly porous organic polymers; (d) characterization of microporosity in these polymers; and (e) future developments for highly porous organic polymers for H2 fuel storage. These topics will provide an introductory overview of highly porous organic polymers in H2 fuel storage.","Results of Treatment with Modern Fractionated Radiotherapy, Contemporary Stereotactic Radiosurgery, and Transsphenoidal Surgery in Nonfunctioning Pituitary Macroadenoma.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995734,Journal of clinical medicine,2019 06 10,"To compare the effects of contemporary stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), modern fractionated radiotherapy (FRT), and transsphenoidal surgery on nonfunctioning pituitary macroadenoma.",A First Implementation of Underwater Communications in Raw Water Using the 433 MHz Frequency Combined with a Bowtie Antenna.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995733,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 10,"In 2016, there were 317 serious water pollution incidents in the UK, with 78,000 locations where businesses discharge controlled quantities of pollutants into rivers; therefore, continuous monitoring is vital.

Here, we selected six red pear cultivars with different genetic backgrounds to elucidate the characteristics of fruit pigmentation. We detected anthocyanin contents and the expression levels of anthocyanin synthesis-related genes in these cultivars at different stages of fruit development. The anthocyanin contents of all six cultivars showed a rise-drop tendency. Principal component and hierarchical cluster analyses were used to distinguish the types of cultivars and the genes crucial to each anthocyanin accumulation pattern. The six cultivars were divided into three groups. Red Zaosu were clustered into one group, Red Sichou and Starkrimson into another group, and Palacer, Red Bartlett, and 5 Hao clustered into a third group. The expression levels of F3H, UFGT2, MYB10, and bHLH3 were similar among the differential coloration patterns of the six cultivars, suggesting a critical and coordinated mechanism for anthocyanin synthesis. Anthocyanin transporters (GST) and light-responsive genes, such as COP1, PIF3.1, and PIF3.2 played limited roles in the regulation of anthocyanin accumulation. This study provides novel insights into the regulation of anthocyanins synthesis and accumulation in red pears.",Controlling the Composition and Magnetic Properties of Nano-SrFe12O19 Powder Synthesized from Oily Cold Mill Sludge by the Citrate Precursor Method.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995731,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 10,"This paper proposes a new method for producing nano-SrFe12O19 powder by the citrate precursor route using solid waste as a source of iron. This solid iron-containing waste, which exists in the form of an oily sludge, is produced by a cold rolling mill. This sludge was first subjected to a process, including sulfuric acid leaching, oxidation, precipitation, and nitric acid leaching, to obtain an iron nitrate (Fe(NO3)3) solution. Next, the Fe(NO3)3 solution was mixed with a strontium nitrate (Sr(NO3)2) solution obtained by subjecting strontium carbonate to nitric acid leaching. Subsequently, citric acid, as chelating agent, and ammonia water, as precipitating agent, were added to the mixed solution to form a gel. The gel was dried and spontaneously combusted, then annealed at different temperatures for 2 h in flowing air. The effects of the Fe3+/Sr2+ molar ratio and annealing temperature on the formation, morphology, and magnetic properties of SrFe12O19 were investigated. The results showed that single-phase SrFe12O19 powder was obtained by decreasing the Fe3+/Sr2+ molar ratio from the stoichiometric value of 12 to 11.6 and increasing the annealing temperature to 1000 °C for 2 h. Adjustment of the Fe/Sr molar ratio to 12 and the annealing temperature to 900 °C enabled the magnetic properties to be optimized, including saturation magnetization (Ms) 80.2 emu/g, remanence magnetization (Mr) 39.8 emu/g, and coercive force (Hc) 6318 Oe.",Modelling Nutritional Requirements of Growing Pigs from Local Breeds Using InraPorc.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995730,Animals : an open access journal from MDPI,2019 06 10,"Models such as InraPorc enable the growth of pigs to be simulated and their nutrient requirements to be determined.

Data on feed composition, allowance and intake, and body weight (BW) were obtained from literature reports or experiments conducted within the project. Data were used in InraPorc to calibrate 16 growth and intake profiles from nine breeds (Alentejana, Basque, Bísara, Apulo Calabrese, Cinta Senese, Iberian, Krškopolje pig, Mangalitsa, and Moravka), with one to three profiles per breed depending on the experimental conditions or data source. On the 40-100 kg BW range, mean protein deposition (PDm) was low for all breeds (below 116 g/d vs. over 130 g/d in conventional breeds). The age of pigs at 40 kg BW (110 to 206 days) denoted different types of feeding management in addition to genetic differences. The PDm and the lysine requirements were the highest in breeds with the highest average daily gain. In all breeds, a small proportion of total body energy retention was dedicated to protein, with the greatest proportion of energy retention in the form of lipids. Despite some methodological limitations, this study provides initial insights into the nutrient requirements of some local breeds.",Bioactive Compounds and Antioxidant Activity of Mango Peel Liqueurs (Mangifera indica L.) Produced by Different Methods of Maceration.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995729,"Antioxidants (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 10,"The present work had the objective of producing liqueurs from mango peels (varieties ""Haden"" and ""Tommy Atkins"") by processes of alcoholic maceration and maceration with pectinase, as well as to evaluate bioactive compounds by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to diode array detection and fluorescence-detection (RP-HPLC/DAD/FD) and in vitro antioxidant activity (AOX), for by-product potential reuse. Alcoholic maceration in wine ethanol (65% v/v) produced liqueurs with higher phytochemical and AOX content. Maceration with pectinase resulted in liqueurs with higher quercetin-3-O-glucopyranoside content. In relation to mango varieties, Haden liqueurs presented higher bioactive content than Tommy Atkins liqueurs. The liqueurs presented high antioxidant activity. The main bioactive compounds found were flavanols (epicatechin-gallate, epigallocatechin-gallate), flavonols (quercetin-3-O-glucopyranoside and rutin), and phenolic acids (gallic acid, o-coumaric acid, and syringic acid). The present study showed that the production of liqueur enabled the recovering of an important part of the bioactive content of mango peels, suggesting an alternative for the recovery of antioxidant substances from this by-product."

The method by which cardiomyocytes undergoes maturation has significant implications for understanding cardiomyocytes biology. The regulation of the extracellular matrix (ECM) by changing the composition and stiffness is quintessential for engineering a suitable environment for cardiomyocytes maturation. In this paper, we demonstrate that collagen type I, a component of the ECM, plays a crucial role in the maturation of cardiomyocytes. To this end, embryonic stem-cell derived cardiomyocytes were incorporated into Matrigel-based hydrogels with varying collagen type I concentrations of 0 mg, 3 mg, and 6 mg. Each hydrogel was analyzed by measuring the degree of stiffness, the expression levels of MLC2v, TBX18, and pre-miR-21, and the size of the hydrogels. It was shown that among the hydrogel variants, the Matrigel-based hydrogel with 3 mg of collagen type I facilitates cardiomyocyte maturation by increasing MLC2v expression. The treatment of transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1) or fibroblast growth factor 4 (FGF-4) on the hydrogels further enhanced the MLC2v expression and thereby cardiomyocyte maturation.",Molecular Epidemiology of HIV-1 Subtype G in the Russian Federation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995717,Viruses,2019 06 10,"Although HIV-1 subtype A has predominated in Russia since the end of the 20th century, other viral variants also circulate in this country. The dramatic outbreak of HIV-1 subtype G in 1988-1990 represents the origin of this variant spreading in Russia. However, full genome sequencing of the nosocomial viral variant and an analysis of the current circulating variants have not been conducted. We performed near full-length genome sequencing and phylogenetic and recombination analyses of 11 samples; the samples were determined to be subtype G based on an analysis of the pol region. Three samples were reliably obtained from patients infected during the nosocomial outbreak. The other 8 samples were obtained from patients who were diagnosed in 2010-2015. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed that a man from the Democratic Republic of the Congo was the origin of the outbreak. We also found that currently circulating viral variants that were genotyped as subtype G according to their pol region are in fact unique recombinant forms. These recombinant forms are similar to the BG-recombinants from Western Europe, particularly Spain and Portugal. The limitations of subtyping based on the pol region suggest that these viral variants are more widespread in Europe than is currently supposed.",The Roles of Electrostatic Interactions in Capsid Assembly Mechanisms of Giant Viruses.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995716,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 06 10,"In the last three decades, many giant DNA viruses have been discovered. Giant viruses present a unique and essential research frontier for studies of self-assembly and regulation of supramolecular assemblies. The question on how these giant DNA viruses assemble thousands of proteins so accurately to form their protein shells, the capsids, remains largely unanswered. Revealing the mechanisms of giant virus assembly will help to discover the mysteries of many self-assembly biology problems. Paramecium bursaria Chlorella virus-1 (PBCV-1) is one of the most intensively studied giant viruses. Here, we implemented a multi-scale approach to investigate the interactions among PBCV-1 capsid building units called capsomers. Three binding modes with different strengths are found between capsomers around the relatively flat area of the virion surface at the icosahedral 2-fold axis. Furthermore, a capsomer structure manipulation package is developed to simulate the capsid assembly process. Using these tools, binding forces among capsomers were investigated and binding funnels were observed that were consistent with the final assembled capsid. In addition, total binding free energies of each binding mode were calculated. The results helped to explain previous experimental observations. Results and tools generated in this work established an initial computational approach to answer current unresolved questions regarding giant virus assembly mechanisms. Results will pave the way for studying more complicated process in other biomolecular structures.",LKB1 and Tumor Metabolism: The Interplay of Immune and Angiogenic Microenvironment in Lung Cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995715,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 06 10,"Liver kinase B1 (LKB1) is a tumor suppressor gene whose inactivation is frequent in different tumor types, especially in lung adenocarcinoma (about 30% of cases). LKB1 has an essential role in the control of cellular redox homeostasis by regulating ROS production and detoxification. Loss of LKB1 makes the tumor cell more sensitive to oxidative stress and consequently to stress-inducing treatments, such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy. LKB1 loss triggers complex changes in tumor microenvironment, supporting a role in the regulation of angiogenesis and suggesting a potential role in the response to anti-angiogenic treatment. On the other hand, LKB1 deficiency can promote an immunosuppressive microenvironment and may be involved in primary resistance to anti-PD-1/anti-PD-L1, as it has been reported in lung cancer. The aim of this review is to discuss interactions of LKB1 with the tumor microenvironment and the potential applications of this knowledge in predicting response to treatment in lung cancer.",Decoding the Information Contained in Fluorophore Radiation Patterns.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995713,ACS nano,2019 04 18,"Dipole radiation patterns change when a fluorescent molecule comes close to the boundary between media of different refractive indices. Near-interface molecules emit mostly into the higher-index medium, predominantly around the critical angle. The radiation pattern encodes information about the emitter distance, orientation, and the refractive index of the embedding medium. Analyses of the supercritical angle fluorescence on pupil plane images can retrieve this information and have been applied both for refractometry with subcellular resolution and for the detection of metabolically active cancerous cells. In this issue of ACS Nano, Ferdman et al. employ this strategy in a label-free assay for detecting single bacteria, based on measuring the refractive-index change produced by bacterial growth in a fluorophore-coated microfluidic channel.",Comparing Rural and Urban Medicare Advantage Beneficiary Characteristics.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995707,Rural policy brief,2019 04 22,"The Medicare Advantage (MA) program allows Medicare beneficiaries to receive benefits from private plans rather than from traditional fee-for-service (FFS) Medicare.

We then compared this with the number of comparisons predicted by use of the formula and finally with the reported number of comparisons (indirect or direct) within the network meta-analysis. A total of 133 trials of 8 interventions were selected which included 163 comparisons. The network of these showed 16 unique direct comparisons. The formula predicted an expected 28 indirect or direct comparisons and this is the number that were indeed reported. The formula produces an accurate enumeration of the potential comparisons within a single trial or network meta-analysis. Its use could help transparency of reporting should a shortfall occur between comparisons actually used and the potential total.,The study of protein recruitment to laser-induced DNA lesions can be distorted by photoconversion of the DNA binding dye Hoechst.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30828443,F1000Research,2019 04 18,"A commonly used approach for assessing DNA repair factor recruitment in mammalian cells is to induce DNA damage with a laser in the UV or near UV range and follow the local increase of GFP-tagged proteins at the site of damage. Often these measurements are performed in the presence of the blue DNA dye Hoechst, which is used as a photosensitizer. However, a light-induced switch of Hoechst from a blue-light to a green-light emitter will give a false positive signal at the site of damage.  Thus, photoconversion signals must be subtracted from the overall green-light emission to determine true recruitment. Here we demonstrate the photoconversion effect and suggest control experiments to exclude false-positive results.","Virologic failure and HIV drug resistance on simplified, dolutegravir-based maintenance therapy: Systematic review and meta-analysis.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30271590,F1000Research,2019 05 21,"Background: Dolutegravir-containing maintenance therapy is a promising simplification strategy for virologically suppressed HIV-infected individuals. However, most of the available data to inform this strategy come from small, uncontrolled studies. We estimated the proportion of HIV-infected patients experiencing virological failure (VF) and developing drug resistance on dolutegravir (DTG)-based maintenance therapy. Methods: We searched Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central, Web of Science, and conference abstracts for studies assessing VF on DTG-based maintenance therapy. Studies including ≥5 adults with an undetectable viral load on antiretroviral therapy (ART) who switched to a DTG-based mono- or dual therapy were included. Pooled proportions of VF were estimated using random-intercept logistic meta-regression and acquired drug resistance mutations described for each strategy. Results: Of 1719 studies considered, 21 met our selection criteria, including seven interventional and 14 observational studies. Eight studies including 251 patients assessed VF on DTG monotherapy and fourteen studies including 1670 participants VF on dual therapy. The participant's median age ranged from 43 to 63 years, their median nadir CD4 count from 90 to 399 cells/µl, and 27.6% were female. The proportion of participants experiencing VF on DTG-monotherapy was 3.6% (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.9-6.7) at 24 weeks and 8.9% (95% CI 4.7-16.2) at 48 weeks. Resistance mutations developed in seven (3.6%) participants on DTG-monotherapy. Among patients on dual therapy, ten (0.7%, 95% CI 0.4-1.3) experienced VF by 48 weeks and none developed resistance to DTG. In adjusted analyses, VF at 24 weeks was less likely on dual therapy than on monotherapy (adjusted odds ratio: 0.10, 95% CI 0.03-0.30). Conclusions: Whereas VF is relatively common on DTG maintenance monotherapy, DTG-based dual therapy appears to be a promising simplification strategy for individuals with a suppressed HIV viral load on triple-ART.",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30994997,,2019 05 21,"On July 30-31, 2018, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine held a workshop titled Continuous Manufacturing for the Modernization of Pharmaceutical Production.

The detection and online correction of an error as well as error-based adaptation of subsequent movements enables humans to improve behavior. For this improvement, it is necessary to differentiate between relevant and irrelevant errors. Behavioral adaptations are only reasonable when an error is attributed to one's own behavior and therefore regarded as relevant for subsequent adjustments, whereas irrelevant errors caused by unsystematic external influences should be disregarded. Here, we ask whether error predictions as indexed by the error-related negativity (Ne/ERN) can be used to differentiate relevant and irrelevant errors in movements with a complex visuomotor mapping. Using event-related potentials, we compared the neural activation between relevant (self-induced/internal) errors and irrelevant (externally manipulated) errors in a virtual goal-oriented throwing task. Results show that the Ne/ERN responds more strongly to self-induced errors, while the feedback-related negativity (FRN) more strongly correlates with externally manipulated errors. Moreover, subsequent behavioral adjustments were larger in the relevant compared to the irrelevant error trials. We conclude that predictive processes, marked by the Ne/ERN, can subserve error attribution in naturalistic, complex visuomotor tasks like throwing.",Association between neonatal serum bilirubin and childhood obesity in preterm infants.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995676,Pediatric research,2019 04 25,Serum bilirubin levels are inversely associated with obesity in adults.

The most widely used cytosine base editors (CBEs) induce deamination of DNA cytosines using the rat APOBEC1 enzyme, which is targeted by a linked Cas protein-guide RNA complex3,4. Previous studies of the specificity of CBEs have identified off-target DNA edits in mammalian cells5,6. Here we show that a CBE with rat APOBEC1 can cause extensive transcriptome-wide deamination of RNA cytosines in human cells, inducing tens of thousands of C-to-U edits with frequencies ranging from 0.07% to 100% in 38-58% of expressed genes. CBE-induced RNA edits occur in both protein-coding and non-protein-coding sequences and generate missense, nonsense, splice site, and 5' and 3' untranslated region mutations. We engineered two CBE variants bearing mutations in rat APOBEC1 that substantially decreased the number of RNA edits (by more than 390-fold and more than 3,800-fold) in human cells. These variants also showed more precise on-target DNA editing than the wild-type CBE and, for most guide RNAs tested, no substantial reduction in editing efficiency. Finally, we show that an adenine base editor7 can also induce transcriptome-wide RNA edits. These results have implications for the use of base editors in both research and clinical settings, illustrate the feasibility of engineering improved variants with reduced RNA editing activities, and suggest the need to more fully define and characterize the RNA off-target effects of deaminase enzymes in base editor platforms.",The Impact of Continuous Positive Airway Pressure upon Pleural Fluid Pressures during Thoracentesis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995673,Respiration; international review of thoracic diseases,2019 04 17,Excessive drop of pleural pressure (Ppl) during therapeutic thoracentesis may be related to adverse events and/or to repeated procedures due to incomplete drainage.,Effect of Postoperative Radiotherapy for Brain Metastases: An Analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995671,Oncology research and treatment,2019 05 03,"Brain metastases (BM) have a very poor prognosis, creating a demand for effective local therapies, such as radiotherapy (RT) and neurosurgery, the combination of which is debatable.

The resulting Ga adatoms nucleate with excess As atoms at the NW edges, producing monoatomic-step islands on the {110} sidewalls of GaAs NWs. Finally, when gold atoms diffuse from the seed particle onto the {110} sidewalls during evaporation of the protective As cap, Langmuir evaporation does not take place, leaving the sidewalls of InAsSb NWs atomically flat.",A composite of Fe3O4@C and multilevel porous carbon as high-rate and long-life anode materials for lithium ion batteries.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995631,Nanotechnology,2019 05 30,"The iron oxide-based anode materials are widely studied and reported due to their abundance, low cost, high energy density and environmental friendliness for lithium ion batteries (LIBs). However, the application of LIBs is always limited by the poor rate capability and stability. In order to tackle these issues, a novel material with carbon-encapsulated Fe3O4 nanorods stuck together by multilevel porous carbon (Fe3O4@C/PC) is prepared through directly carbonizing the Fe-based metal-organic framework under a nitrogen atmosphere. This novel material shows a high specific capacity and rate performance. The initial specific capacity can reach 1789 mAh g-1 at a current density of 0.1 A g-1, and the specific capacity still remains 1105.3 mAh g-1 and 783.5 mAh g-1 after 150 cycles at the current densities of 0.1 A g-1 and 1 A g-1, respectively. Even under a current density as high as 12 A g-1, the specific capacity can achieve 309 mAh g-1 after 2000 cycles with an average attenuation rate of 0.019% per cycle.

We find, that the switching of the fast junction into resistive state leads to significant increase of the effective critical current of the slow junction. At the same time, the initial switching of the slow junction may either increase or decrease the effective critical current of the fast junction, depending on ratio of their resistances and the value of the capacitance. Finally, we have found that the slow quasiparticle relaxation (in comparison with Josephson times) leads to appearance of the additional hysteresis on current-voltage characteristics.",Highly efficient nanocrystalline CsxMA1-xPbBrx perovskite layers for white light generation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995629,Nanotechnology,2019 06 06,"Perovskite light converting layers optimization for cost-efficient white light emitting diodes (LED) was demonstrated. High excitation independent internal quantum efficiency (IQE) of 80% and weakly excitation dependent PL spectra suitable for white light generation were obtained in the mixed cation CsxMA1-xPbBr3 perovskite nanocrystal layers with optimal x = 0.3 being determined by effective surface passivation and phase mixing as revealed by x-ray diffraction. Enhancement of the PL homogeneity and the external quantum efficiency (EQE) were secured when using 2,2',2″-(1,3,5-Benzinetriyl)-tris(1-phenyl-1-H-benzimidazole (TPBi) additive in the layer preparation process. Excitation dependent PL intensity, decay time, and IQE revealed that the high emission efficiency of the layers originates from a dominant radiative localized exciton recombination (130 ns) weakly influenced by the nonradiative free carrier recombination (750 ns). Warm and cool white LEDs with correlated color temperature 3000 K and 5600 K, and color rendering index 82 and 74, respectively, were realized by using the optimized perovskite layers, poly[2-methoxy-5-(2-ethylhexyloxy)-1,4-phenylenevinylene] (MEH-PPV) red emitter and a blue LED.",Cooling-field dependence of dipole-induced loop bias.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995628,Nanotechnology,2019 05 08,"In ferromagnet/antiferromagnet bilayers and core/shell nanoparticles, an exchange-bias-like loop bias phenomenon in the ferromagnet is observed solely due to the long-range dipolar interactions between ferromagnet and antiferromagnet. With increasing cooling field, the loop bias field may increase from zero in the bilayers or from a negative value in the core/shell nanoparticles to a positive saturated value, depending on the interfacial dipolar interaction and/or ferromagnetic/antiferromagnetic thickness. Using a modified Monte-Carlo method and the Meiklejohn-Bean model, the interfacial dipole fields (up to several teslas) and the domain sizes imprinted on the interfacial antiferromagnet are explicitly calculated to elucidate the cooling field dependence of loop bias, which is governed by distinct mechanisms at the flat and curved interfaces. Finally, through simply discussing the roles of lattice structure, ferromagnetic dipolar interaction, and simulation time, it is evidenced that the dipole-induced loop bias is ubiquitous and applicable for stabilizing a ferromagnet, irrespective of the interface mismatch and the undeterministic diffusion between different ingredients.

Mathematical model observer performance correlates with human observer performance for localization of liver lesions in abdominal CT imaging.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995626,Physics in medicine and biology,2019 05 10,"Determination of the effect of protocol modifications on diagnostic performance in CT with human observers is extremely time-consuming, limiting the applicability of such methods in routine clinical practice. In this work, we sought to determine whether a channelized Hotelling observer (CHO) could predict human observer performance for the task of liver lesion localization as background, reconstruction algorithm, dose, and lesion size were varied. Liver lesions (5 mm, 7 mm, and 9 mm) were digitally inserted into the CT projection data of patients with normal livers and water phantoms. The projection data were reconstructed with filtered back projection (FBP) and iterative reconstruction (IR) algorithms for three dose levels: full dose (liver CTDIvol  =  10.5  ±  8.5 mGy, water phantom CTDIvol  =  9.6  ±  0.1 mGy) and simulated half and quarter doses. For each of 36 datasets (3 dose levels  ×  2 reconstruction algorithms  ×  2 backgrounds  ×  3 sizes), 66 signal-present and 34 signal-absent 2D images were extracted from the reconstructed volumes. Three medical physicists independently reviewed each dataset and noted the lesion location and a confidence score for each image. A CHO with Gabor channels was calculated to estimate the performance for each of the 36 localization tasks. The CHO performances, quantified using localization receiver operating characteristic (LROC) analysis, were compared to the human observer performances. Performance values between human and model observers were highly correlated for equivalent parameters (same lesion size, dose, background, and reconstruction), with a Spearman's correlation coefficient of 0.93 (95% CI: 0.82-0.98). CHO performance values for the uniform background were strongly correlated (ρ  =  0.94, CI: 0.80-1.0) with the human observer performance values for the liver background.

The widely used methods to fabricate micro-structured pressure sensors are lithography and biomaterial-replicating, which are either complex in preparation procedure or uncontrollable in micro-structure morphology. In this work, laser micro-structured wearable pressure sensors with high-performance are developed for epidermal electronic skin. Laser micro-engineering, with scalability, high-efficiency, and controllability, is employed to prepare a series of micro-structures on elastomers for modulating and enhancing the sensitivity of the sensors. The device with micro-domes owns a sensitivity of -1.82 kPa-1, which is approximately 17 times better than the one based on long micro-ridges. Due to the reduced viscous properties of the elastomers by laser micro-engineering, the sensor based on micro-domes demonstrates rapid response/relaxation speeds of 0.036 and 0.052 s, respectively, and a detection limit of 0.001 kPa. Additionally, the device has a good durability (6,000 cycles) with a repeatability deviation of 1.44%, confirming its stability.

A conventional low-temperature a-Si:H TFT fabrication process combined with a laser lift-off transfer procedure was used to integrate μ-iLEDs with flexible TFT pixel circuits. Electrical and optical characterization showed the current-voltage and electroluminescence characteristics of the TFTs and LEDs did not change after integration onto the flexible platforms.

Histotripsy utilizes short ultrasound pulses with sufficient tension to nucleate bubble clouds that impart lethal strain to the surrounding tissues. Tracking bubble cloud dissolution between the application of histotripsy pulses is critical to ensure treatment efficacy. In this study, plane wave B-mode imaging was employed to monitor bubble cloud motion and grayscale at frame rates up to 11.25 kHz. Minimal changes in the area or position of the bubble clouds were observed 50 ms post excitation. The bubble cloud grayscale was observed to decrease with the square root of time, indicating a diffusion-driven process. These results were qualitatively consistent with an analytic model of gas diffusion during the histotripsy process. Finally, the rate of bubble cloud dissolution was found to be dependent on the output of the imaging pulse, indicating an interaction between the bubble cloud and imaging parameters. Overall, these results highlight the utility of plane wave B-mode imaging for monitoring histotripsy bubble clouds."

To this end, dopants are incorporated during self-catalyzed growth via vapor-liquid-solid mechanism through the catalyst droplet or by vapor-solid mechanism of the sidewall growth. The interplay of these mechanisms together with the competition between axial elongation and radial growth of NWs can result in dopant concentration gradients along the NW axis. Here, we report an investigation of Be-doped p-type GaAs NWs grown by the self-catalyzed method on lithography-free Si/SiO x templates. The influence of dopant incorporation on the structural properties of the NWs is analyzed by scanning and transmission electron microscopy. By combining spatially resolved Raman spectroscopy and transport characterization, we are able to estimate the carrier concentration, mobility and resistivity on single-NW level. We show that Be dopants are incorporated predominantly by vapor-solid mechanism for low Be flux, while the relative contribution of vapor-liquid-solid incorporation is increased for higher Be flux, resulting in axial dopant gradients that depend on the nominal doping level.",Localization of liver lesions in abdominal CT imaging: I.

Liver lesions (5 mm, 7 mm, and 9 mm, contrast:  -21 HU) were digitally inserted into CT projection data of ten normal patients in vessel-free liver regions. Noise was inserted into the projection data to create three image sets: full dose and simulated half and quarter doses. Images were reconstructed with a standard filtered back projection (FBP) and an iterative reconstruction (IR) algorithm. Lesion and noise insertion procedures were repeated with water phantom data. Two-dimensional regions of interest (66 lesion-present, 34 lesion-absent) were selected, randomized, and independently reviewed by three medical physicists to identify the most likely location of the lesion and provide a confidence score. Locations and confidence scores were assessed using the area under the localization receiver operating characteristic curve (AzLROC). We examined the correlation between human performance for the liver and uniform water backgrounds as dose, lesion size, and reconstruction algorithm varied. As lesion size or dose increased, reader localization performance improved. For full dose IR images, the AzLROC for 5, 7, and 9 mm lesions were 0.53, 0.91, and 0.97 (liver) and 0.51, 0.96, and 0.99 (uniform water), respectively. Similar trends were seen with other parameters. Performance values for liver and uniform backgrounds were highly correlated for both reconstruction algorithms, with a Spearman correlation of ρ  =  0.97, and an average difference in AzLROC of 0.05  ±  0.04. For the task of localizing low contrast liver lesions, human observer performance was highly correlated between anatomical and uniform backgrounds, suggesting that lesion localization studies emulating a clinical test of liver lesion detection can be performed using a uniform background.",Dynamic Nuclear Polarization / solid-state NMR of membranes. Thermal effects and sample geometry.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995597,Solid state nuclear magnetic resonance,2019 05 13,"Whereas specially designed dinitroxide biradicals, reconstitution protocols, oriented sample geometries and NMR probes have helped to much increase the DNP enhancement factors of membrane samples they still lag considerably behind those obtained from glasses made of protein solutions. Here we show that not only the MAS rotor material but also the distribution of the membrane samples within the NMR rotor have a pronounced effect on the DNP enhancement. These observations are rationalized with the cooling efficiency and the internal properties of the sample, monitored by their T1 relaxation, microwave ON versus OFF signal intensities and DNP effect. The data are suggestive that for membranes the speed of cooling has a pronounced effect on the membrane properties and concomitantly the distribution of biradicals within the sample.",Radiocarbon dating of ivory: Potentialities and limitations in forensics.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995596,Forensic science international,2019 05 29,"The determination of the age of elephant ivory is a crucial aspect in the fight against illegal ivory trade which is still a relevant problem having triggered the decline of elephant populations due to poaching in different areas of the globe.

These studies vary widely in the approach to measurement of emotion-related measurements after MBI's. A systematic review of randomized clinical trials of MBIs was conducted with a focus on identifying what emotion-related assays were able to detect changes with MBI's, including scales and instruments (both self-report and clinician-rated) on constructs such as depression, anxiety, emotion regulation, and other mood states. In this paper, we reflect on these findings and discuss considerations of outcome measures in MBI research.

Sepsis was induced by cecal ligation and puncture in anesthetized rats. Animals were then randomly assigned to receive intravenous injection of vehicle or MRP4 inhibitor (MK571, 20 mg/kg). The pathological changes were observed by hematoxylin and eosin staining. Lung water content, lung vascular permeability and inflammatory cell count in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were quantified. Serum tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels were measured. In addition, lung tissue cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels were examined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Furthermore, the effects of MRP4 knockdown on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced endothelial permeability and the cytoskeleton of rat pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (PMVECs) were detected. The protein expression levels of MRP4, Rac1, VE-cadherin, β-catenin and ZO-1 were measured by Western blot analysis. MK571 significantly reduced lung tissue damage, lung water content and lung vascular permeability. Lung tissue cAMP levels were attenuated in MK571-treated animals compared with vehicle controls. MK571 also decreased sepsis-induced inflammatory cell accumulation in BALF. In addition, the MK571 group had significantly lower serum TNF-α and IL-6 levels compared with vehicle controls. Consistently, knockdown of MRP4 protected against LPS-induced increase in the endothelial permeability and the destruction of cytoskeleton in vitro. Furthermore, silencing MRP4 gene significantly reduced MRP4 protein expression and restored the protein expression of Rac1, VE-cadherin, β-catenin and ZO-1 in rat PMVECs in response to LPS stimulation. These data suggest that inhibition of MRP4 significantly alleviates sepsis-induced acute lung injury in rats.","Halogenated flame retardants in mangrove sediments from the Pearl River Estuary, South China: Comparison with historical data and correlation with microbial community.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995592,Chemosphere,2019 05 13,"Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), decabromodiphenyl ethane (DBDPE), 1,2-bis(2,4,6-tribromophenoxy)ethane (BTBPE), tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA), hexabromocyclododecane (HBCDD) and dechlorane plus (DP) were measured in sediments collected from three mangrove wetlands of the Pearl River Estuary (PRE) in South China. This study aims to investigate the distribution of these halogenated flame retardants (HFRs) and the correlations between HFRs and microbial community structure in mangrove sediments. Concentrations of PBDEs, DBDPE, BTBPE, TBBPA, HBCDD and DP in mangrove sediments ranged from 6.97 to 216.1, 3.70-26.0, 0.02-0.73, 0.02-37.5, 0.44-127.5 and 0.07-2.23 ng/g dry weight, respectively. Higher levels of PBDEs, BTBPE, HBCDD and DP were observed in sediments from Futian mangrove wetland of Shenzhen, the only nature reserve located in the downtown of China. The highest concentration of TBBPA found in mangrove sediments from Guangzhou was proximate to a ferry terminal and a dockyard where TBBPA is widely used in the coatings. PBDEs were the predominant HFRs in mangrove sediments, with an average contribution of 63.0%. Mangrove sediments from Guangzhou and Zhuhai showed an enrichment of (-)-α-HBCDD, (-)-β-HBCDD and (-)-γ-HBCDD. Concentrations of HFRs in mangrove sediments from Guangzhou increased significantly from 2012 to 2015, which was probably due to the establishment and rapid development of Nansha Free Trade Zone of Guangzhou. Redundancy analysis showed that HFRs may cause a shift of microbial community structure in mangrove sediments and the variations were significantly correlated with TBBPA, syn-DP and BTBPE.","Levels, spatial distribution and isomer profiles of perfluoroalkyl acids in soil, groundwater and tap water around a manufactory in China.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995591,Chemosphere,2019 05 13,"In this study, 32 surface soil samples, 24 groundwater samples, and 6 tap water samples were collected around a perfluorosulfonates (PFSAs) manufactory in China to analyze the distributions of perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) including linear and branched isomers. The total concentrations of PFAAs (∑PFAAs) ranged from 1.30 to 913 ng/g on a dry weight basis (dw), 31.4-15656 ng/L, and 11.8-59.7 ng/L in soil, groundwater and tap water samples respectively. Perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA) were the predominant PFAAs in the soil whereas PFBA was the predominant congener in groundwater. PFAA concentrations in the soil and groundwater decreased with increasing distance from the manufactory. Shorter-chain PFAAs showed higher proportions in groundwater than in soil samples and that shorter-chain PFAAs exhibited faster decreasing rates in soil samples, which may be due to the differences in the polarity and hydrophobicity of these molecules. For isomer profiles, n-PFHxS, n-PFOS, and n-PFOA were the main isomer in soil samples and groundwater samples. Direct exposure to PFOS and PFOA via the soil and tap water posed relatively low risk to the residents' health.",Quantitation of vitamin K1 in serum using online SPE-LC-MS/MS and the challenges of working with vitamin K.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995590,"Journal of chromatography. B, Analytical technologies in the biomedical and life sciences",2019 05 20,"Vitamin K1 (phylloquinone) is one of the vitamin Ks. Several studies have previously investigated the role of vitamin K1 status in respect to disease, but without consistent results. Since vitamin K deficiency has been associated with different disease states it is important to develop a biochemical analysis with sufficient sensitivity and a low limit of quantitation (LOQ). The vitamin Ks are very fat-soluble. This non-polar nature has given rise to several challenges during the method development, because vitamin K1 sticks to materials used during the process and is lost during evaporation. We found that reducing the sample preparation as much as possible offline, instead using online SPE-LC-MS/MS improves recovery and gives satisfactory chromatograms. An Protein BEH C4 column, 300 Å (50 × 2.1 mm, 1.7 μm particle size) was used as trap column and a Phenyl-Hexyl-LC-column, 100 Å (100 × 2.1 mm, 2.6 μm particle size) was used as analytical column. The mobile phases consisted of 30 μmol/L NH4F in water and 30 μmol/L NH4F in MeOH. A triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometer with atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) ion source, positive ion mode, was used to perform the mass spectrometric measurements. The method is simple, highly sensitive and fast. The method was validated for vitamin K1 with good analytical performance. With a LOQ of 0.05 nmol/L it is to our knowledge the vitamin K1 method with lowest LOQ reported to date in the literature. It can easily be automated and applied in a routine diagnostic laboratory. Blood collection tubes with different additives were tested and showed no difference. Stability of vitamin K1 in serum was tested at different temperatures (-20 °C, 4 °C and in light and dark at 20 °C over a period of 30 days) and showed that vitamin K1 is light sensitive in serum even after only one day.","The kinetics, thermodynamics and mineral crystallography of CaCO3 precipitation by dissolved organic matter and salinity.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995589,The Science of the total environment,2019 05 06,"Calcium carbonate (CaCO3) precipitation is an important geochemical process. In the estuary zone and some arid shallow lakes, DOM (dissolved organic matter) and salinity are two frequent changing factors that may affect CaCO3 precipitation. The joint effect of DOM and salinity on CaCO3 precipitation kinetics and thermodynamics are still unclear. In this study, effects of DOM on CaCO3 precipitation process at 0.5‰ and 70‰ salinity were investigated by QCM (Quartz Crystal Microbalance) technique, real-time pH measurement and single-injection nanoliter ITC (isothermal titration calorimetry). The mineral crystallography was analyzed by SEM-EDS. Both DOM and salinity had inhibitory effect on CaCO3 precipitation. DOM had more pronounced inhibitory effect on CaCO3 precipitation at lower salinity. Regardless of DOM, 70‰ salinity inhibited CaCO3 precipitation >0.5‰ salinity. The CaCO3 precipitation kinetics followed the first-order kinetic model and the adhesion kinetics of the instantaneous nucleation and crystal growth stage could be well described by the exponential function. CaCO3 precipitation was an endothermic process and high salinity strongly hindered CaCO3 precipitation. The effect of DOM on the absorbed heat was significant at 0.5‰ salinity. At 70‰ salinity, regardless of the effect of DOM, CaCO3 precipitation rate was greatly slowed down because it needed much more heat. CaCO3 minerals were dominated by rhombohedral calcite while CaCO3 minerals were mainly shaped as spherical vaterite at 0.5‰ salinity and rhombohedral calcite at 70‰ salinity. The crystal phase changed during CaCO3 precipitation at 0.5‰ salinity. In conclusion, the presence of DOM had substantial impact on the micrograph of the CaCO3 minerals. The percentage of flawed crystals with rough surface increased significantly with increased DOM concentration."

In the present paper, a complete UV-Vis transient absorption spectroscopic characterisation of this compound is provided, including triplet-triplet spectra, triplet lifetimes and rate constants for quenching of 2M by a dimeric thymine derivative. Furthermore, generation of singlet oxygen has been proven by time-resolved near IR phosphorescence measurements. Overall, the obtained results confirm the potential of 2M as a DNA photosensitiser, not only for CPDs formation, but also for oxidative damage.",Perchlorate bio-reduction in a methane-based membrane biofilm reactor in the presence and absence of oxygen.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995575,Water research,2019 05 04,"Perchlorate has been widely detected in various water environments and could cause serious health problems. Methane has been proposed as a promising electron donor to remove perchlorate from contaminated water, yet it is unclear whether and how microbial methane oxidation couples with perchlorate reduction, in particular under anoxic conditions. Here, the feasibility and performance of perchlorate reduction driven by methane in the presence and absence of oxygen were investigated and compared in a lab-scale methane-based membrane biofilm reactor. Long-term operational performance suggested that perchlorate was reduced to chloride, with 4 mg Cl/L/d of perchlorate removal rate under anoxic conditions. Differently, perchlorate removal rate increased to 16 mg Cl/L/d, and volatile fatty acids (VFAs) were produced from methane partial oxidation when a limited oxygen (10 mg/L/d) was externally supplied. Regardless of oxygen conditions, microbial perchlorate reduction driven by methane might be mediated through synergistic interactions by a microbial consortium, but with different key microbial members under both oxygen regimes. Under anoxic conditions, aerobic methanotrophs (likely Methylocystaceae and Methylococcaceae) might micro-aerobically oxidize methane by utilizing internal oxygen from microbial perchlorate reduction, which might be mediated by Rhodocyclaceae. In contrast, under oxygen-limiting conditions, methanogens (e.g., Methanosarcina) and fermenters (e.g., Veillonellaceae) likely jointly converted methane into VFAs, then dissimilatory perchlorate-reducing bacteria (e.g., Rhodocyclaceae) utilized the produced VFAs to reduce perchlorate to chloride. Our findings provide evidence to link methane oxidation with perchlorate reduction under both oxygen regimes, which could be facilitated to design a process to remove perchlorate from groundwater.","Evaluation of the impact of antimicrobial hand towels on hand contamination with Escherichia coli among mothers in Kisumu County, Kenya, 2011-2012.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995574,Water research,2019 06 10,"Poor hand hygiene contributes to diarrhea in developing countries. Handwashing with soap reduces diarrhea risk, but drying hands on contaminated towels can compromise the benefits of handwashing. In response to the challenge of keeping hands clean, an antimicrobial hand towel was developed and shown to be promising in the laboratory, but has not been adequately tested in the field. We evaluated the effectiveness of an antimicrobial towel in two randomized, double-blinded crossover trials among mothers with children<5 years old in 125 households in western Kenya. In trial 1, we randomly assigned mothers to use either the treated towel or an identical untreated (placebo) towel and made surprise home visits at random times once a week for three weeks. At each visit, we tested hands for Escherichia coli using sterile hand rinses, then switched towel types in the two groups and repeated three weekly rounds of E. coli testing. In crossover trial 2, we compared E. coli contamination of maternal hands immediately following three different handwashing/drying procedures: soap and water + treated towel, water only + treated towel, and soap and water + air dry. There was no statistically significant difference in the level of E. coli contamination on maternal hands by type of towel used during trial 1 (odds ratio for treated vs untreated towel: 1.14, 95% confidence interval 0.83-1.56). In trial 2, there were no significant differences in E. coli contamination of maternal hands by handwashing/drying procedure. In these trials, use of antimicrobial hand towels did not prevent E. coli contamination of mothers' hands in Kenyan households during random testing and offered no advantages over standard handwashing and drying practices. Handwashing with soap and clean water and drying with clean towels are recommended.",Self-assembly of graphene oxide/PEDOT:PSS nanocomposite as a novel adsorbent for uranium immobilization from wastewater.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995573,"Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)",2019 05 25,"In recent years, water pollution caused by radionuclides has become a rising concern, among which uranium is a representative class of actinide element. Since hexavalent uranium, i.e. U(VI), is biologically hazardous with high migration, it's essential to develop efficient adsorbents to minimize the impact on the environment. Towards this end, we have synthesized a novel material (GO/PEDOT:PSS) by direct assembling graphene oxide (GO) and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) through a facile ball milling method, which shows impressing performance for the immobilization of U(VI). On the basis of the batch experiments, GO/PEDOT:PSS exhibits ionic strength-independent sorption edges and temperature-promoted sorption isotherms, revealing an inner-sphere complexation with endothermic nature. The sorption kinetics can be illustrated by the pseudo-second-order model, yielding a rate constant of 1.09. × 10-2 g mg-1∙min-1, while the sorption isotherms are in coincidence with the Langmuir model, according to which the maximum sorption capacity is measured to be 384.51 mg g-1 at pH 4.5 under 298 K, indicating a monolayer sorption mechanism. In the light of the FT-IR and XPS investigations, the surface carboxyl/sulfonate group is responsible to the chelation of U(VI), indicating that the enhanced sorption capacity may be ascribed to the PSS moiety. These findings can greatly contribute to the design strategy for developing highly efficient adsorbents in the field of radioactive wastewater treatment.",Revelation of microalgae's lipid production and resistance mechanism to ultra-high Cd stress by integrated transcriptome and physiochemical analyses.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995572,"Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)",2019 05 25,"The ultra-high Cd polluted environment is a special habitat in nature.

In this study, integrated analyses of the transcriptome, multi-physiological and biochemical data and fatty acid profilings of UTEX2341 were performed for the first time. It was found that exogenous Ca ions could alleviate Cd stress. Manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase and peroxidase also participated in intracellular detoxification. And non-enzymatic antioxidants rather than one specific enzymatic antioxidant were suggested to be used as ""core antioxidants"", which witnessed better performance in Cd detoxification. In addition, Cd stress improved sixteen alkane value and biofuel yield and quality.",Seasonal fluctuations of metal bioaccumulation and reproductive health of local oyster populations in a large contaminated estuary.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995571,"Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)",2019 05 25,"Despite of much evidence of trace metal pollution in the Pearl River Estuary (PRE), the seasonal dynamics of metal bioavailability as well as the potential impacts of metal pollution on the local marine organisms in this estuary is poorly understood. In the present study, the accumulation of trace metals and reproductive states of three populations of oyster Crassostrea hongkongensis, a keystone bivalve species in the PRE, were for the first time investigated throughout a one-year field study. Significant temporal fluctuations of metal accumulation were observed in the somatic tissues of oysters, suggesting seasonal variations of metal bioavailability in the PRE. A major feature of the seasonal variations was the increased levels of metal bioaccumulation in the summer season for the contaminated sites nearby the major river inlets. High riverine inputs accompanied by relatively lower salinity in summer may greatly contribute to such variations. Furthermore, oyster populations from two contaminated sites had a poor reproductive condition in comparison with the reference oyster population, as reflected by a significant decrease of gonad-somatic index (GSI) and gonad cover area (GCA), as well as an obvious change of sex ratios. Gonadal metal accumulation of Cu, Zn, Ni, Co and Pb in the contaminated oysters was much higher than that in the relatively uncontaminated oysters. Especially, the concentrations of these metals in the gonad during the breeding season had significantly negative correlations with the gonad condition indexes (GSI and GCA). Our results suggested strong seasonal fluctuations of bioavailability of trace metals in this highly contaminated estuary as well as an adverse effect of metal pollution on the reproduction of local oyster populations.",Host bacterial community of MGEs determines the risk of horizontal gene transfer during composting of different animal manures.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995570,"Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)",2019 05 25,"Mobile genetic elements (MGEs) play critical roles in transferring antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) among different microorganisms in the environment. This study aimed to explore the fate of MGEs during chicken manure (CM) and bovine manure (BM) composting to assess horizontal transfer risks of ARGs. The results showed that the removal efficiency of MGEs during CM composting was significantly higher than that during BM composting, because the potential host bacteria of MGEs were eliminated largely during CM composting. Meanwhile, these potential host bacterial communities are significantly influenced by pH, NH4+, NO3- and total N, which can be used to regulate host bacterial communities to remove MGEs during composting. Projection pursuit regression further confirmed that composting can effectively reduce the horizontal transfer risk of ARGs, especially for CM composting. These results identified the critical roles of host bacterial communities in MGEs removal during composting of different animal manures.","Effect of differently methyl-substituted ionic liquids on Scenedesmus obliquus growth, photosynthesis, respiration, and ultrastructure.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995569,"Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)",2019 05 25,"Concerns have been raised regarding the ecotoxicity of ionic liquids (ILs) owing to their wide usage in numerous fields.

The results showed that algal growth was significantly inhibited by ILs treatments. The observed IC50,48h doses were 0.10 mg/L [C10IM]Cl, 0.01 mg/L [C10MIM]Cl, and 0.02 mg/L [C10DMIM]Cl. The chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, and total chlorophyll content declined, and the chlorophyll fluorescence parameters, minimal fluorescence yield (F0), maximal fluorescence yield (Fm), maximum quantum yield of PSII photochemistry (Fv/Fm), effective quantum yield of PSII [Y(II)], non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) and non-photosynthetic losses yield [Y(NO)] were notably affected by ILs in a dose-dependent manner. ILs affected the primary photosynthetic reaction, impaired heat dissipation capability, and diminished photosynthetic efficiency, indicating negative effects on photosystem II. The photosynthetic and respiration rates of algal cells were also reduced due to the ILs treatments. The adverse effects of ILs on plasmolysis and chloroplast deformation were examined using ultrastructural analyses; chloroplast swelling and lamellar structure almost disappeared after the [C10MIM]Cl treatment, and an increased number of starch grains and vacuoles was observed after all ILs treatments. The results indicated that one-methyl-substituted ILs were more toxic than non-methyl-substituted ILs, which were also more toxic than di-methyl-substituted ILs. The toxicity of the examined ILs showed the following order: [C10IM]Cl < [C10DMIM]Cl ≤ [C10MIM]Cl."

Notably, all molecules involved in translation, such as ribosomal proteins and all tRNA synthetases, were already present before LUCA. The metabolism belonged to extremophiles as hinted by the presence of reverse gyrase and acetyl coenzyme A synthase.

Unsuccessful transition prevents the increase in pulmonary blood flow after birth resulting in hypoxemia and persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN). Management of neonates with PPHN includes ventilation of the lungs with supplemental oxygen to correct hypoxemia. Optimal oxygenation should meet oxygen demand to the tissues and avoid hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV) while preventing oxidative stress. The optimal target for oxygenation in PPHN is not known. Animal models have demonstrated that PaO2<45 mmHg exacerbates HPV. However, there are no practical methods of assessing oxygen levels associated with oxidant stress. Oxidant stress can be due to free radical generation from underlying lung disease or from free radicals generated by supplemental oxygen. Free radicals act on the nitric oxide pathway reducing cGMP and promoting pulmonary vasoconstriction. Antioxidant therapy improves systemic oxygenation in an animal model of PPHN but there are no clinical trials to support such therapy. Targeting preductal SpO2 between 90 and 97% and PaO2 at 50-80 mmHg appears prudent in PPHN but clinical trials to support this practice are lacking. Preterm infants with PPHN present unique challenges due to lack of antioxidant defenses and functional and structural immaturity of the lungs. This review highlights the need for additional studies to mitigate the impact of oxidative stress in the lung and pulmonary vasculature in PPHN.",Reactive oxygen species as mediators of oxygen signaling during fetal-to-neonatal circulatory transition.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995535,Free radical biology & medicine,2019 04 27,"Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are frequently seen as pathological agents of oxidative stress. However, ROS are not always deleterious and can also act as cell signaling molecules. Vascular oxygen sensing and signaling during fetal-to-neonatal circulatory transition is a remarkable example of the physiological regulatory actions of ROS. The fetal relative hypoxic environment induces hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV) and ductus arteriosus (DA) relaxation favoring the presence of high pulmonary vascular resistance and right-to-left ductal shunt. At birth, the increase in oxygen tension causes relaxation of pulmonary arteries (PAs) and normoxic DA vasoconstriction (NDAV), thus diverting blood flow to the lungs. Although the response to changes in oxygen tension is diametrically opposite, the mechanisms responsible for HPV and NDAV appear to be the result of a similar interaction between triggering and modulating factors that lead to an increase in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration and Ca2+ sensitization of the contractile apparatus. Growing evidence points to an increase in ROS (mitochondria- and/or NADPH-derived superoxide and/or H2O2), leading to inhibition of voltage-gated K+ channels, membrane depolarization, and activation of voltage-gated L-type Ca2+ channels as critical events in the signaling pathway of both HPV and NDAV. Several groups of investigators have completed this pathway adding other elements such as neutral sphingomyelinase-derived ceramide, the sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum (through ryanodine and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors), Rho kinase-mediated Ca2+ sensitization, or transient receptor potential channels.

Cultivation of Aspergillus terreus (ATCC 20542) with carbohydrates or low-value feedstocks such as glycerol produces lovastatin as a secondary metabolite and (+)-geodin as a by-product. An A. terreus mutant strain was developed (gedCΔ) with a disrupted (+)-geodin biosynthesis pathway. The gedCΔ mutant was created by inserting the antibiotic marker hygromycin B (hyg) within the gedC gene that encodes emodin anthrone polyketide synthase (PKS), a primary gene responsible for initiating (+)-geodin biosynthesis. The effects of emodin anthrone PKS gene disruption on (+)-geodin and lovastatin biosynthesis and the production of the precursors acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA were investigated with cultures based on glycerol alone and in combination with lactose. The gedCΔ strain showed improved lovastatin production, particularly when cultivated on the glycerol-lactose mixture, increasing lovastatin production by 80% (113 mg/L) while simultaneously inhibiting (+)-geodin biosynthesis compared to the wild-type strain.

Cross-sectional imaging techniques, such as magnetic resonance (MR) enterography, computed tomography enterography, and bowel ultrasound, are used to assess small-bowel and CD-related complications, including strictures. It is important to be able to determine the degree of inflammation and fibrosis in strictures to select the best therapy; this can be a challenge because inflammation and fibrosis co-exist to varying degrees in a damaged bowel segment. Delayed gadolinium enhancement, magnetization transfer MR imaging, and ultrasound elastography seem to be promising tools for assessing fibrosis in patients with CD.

This review article provides a report on the global pattern and characteristics of mushroom poisoning and identifies the magnitude of mortality induced by mushroom poisoning. In this work, reasons underlying mushrooms-induced poisoning, and contamination of edible mushrooms by heavy metals and radionuclides, are provided. Moreover, a perspective of factors affecting the clinical signs of such toxicities (e.g. consumed species, the amount of eaten mushroom, season, geographical location, method of preparation, and individual response to toxins) as well as mushroom toxins and approaches suggested to protect humans against mushroom poisoning, are presented.",Oleuropein aglycone and hydroxytyrosol interfere differently with toxic Aβ1-42 aggregation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995514,Food and chemical toxicology : an international journal published for the British Industrial Biological Research Association,2019 06 07,"Oleuropein aglycone (OleA), the most abundant polyphenol in extra virgin olive oil (EVOO), and Hydroxythyrosol (HT), the OleA main metabolite, have attracted our interest due to their multitarget effects, including the interference with amyloid aggregation path. However, the mechanistic details of their anti-amyloid effect are not known yet. We report here a broad biophysical approach and cell biology techniques that enabled us to characterize the different molecular mechanisms by which OleA and HT modulate the Aβ1-42 fibrillation, a main histopathological feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In particular, OleA prevents the growth of toxic Aβ1-42 oligomers and blocks their successive growth into mature fibrils following its interaction with the peptide N-terminus, while HT speeds up harmless fibril formation. Our data demonstrate that, by stabilizing oligomers and fibrils, both polyphenols reduce their seeding activity and aggregate/membrane interaction on human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. These findings highlight the great potential of EVOO polyphenols and offer the possibility to validate and to optimize their use for possible AD prevention and therapy.",Anti-diabetic activity of PUFAs-rich extracts of Chlorella pyrenoidosa and Spirulina platensis in rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995513,Food and chemical toxicology : an international journal published for the British Industrial Biological Research Association,2019 05 07,"The contributions to hypoglycemic function and gut microbiota regulation by water and ethanol extracts of the microalgae Chlorella pyrenoidosa and Spirulina platensis were determined.

After an 8-week high-fat high-sucrose diet with C. pyrenoidosa and S. platensis supplementation, glucose tolerance was improved, and the composition of the gut microbiota was altered. The diversity of the gut bacterial community was evaluated using 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing. C. pyrenoidosa supplementation increased the abundance of Ruminococcus, Parasutterella, and Erysipelotrichacea and decreased the abundance of Lactobacillus, Turicibacter, and Blautia; S. platensis supplementation increased the abundance of Oscillibacter, Parasutterella, and Alloprevotella and decreased the abundance of Turicibacter. Moreover, Erysipelotrichacea and Ruminococcus were uniquely increased in C. pyrenoidosa treatment groups. Thus, CP55 and SP55 may be developed as effective natural food materials for preventing diabetes, and Ruminococcus may play a vital role in the treatment of diabetes.",Depression in neurodegenerative diseases: Common mechanisms and current treatment options.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995512,Neuroscience and biobehavioral reviews,2019 06 09,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a highly prevalent psychiatric disorder and a major cause of disability worldwide. This neurological condition is commonly associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD) and Huntington's disease (HD), and has a significant impact on the increasing burden of these neuropathologies. Over the past decades, some of the pathophysiological and molecular mechanisms that contribute to these diseases have been elucidated and these findings indicate that, despite presenting distinct features, there are several similarities between the neurobiological alterations that lead to MDD and neurodegeneration in AD, PD, and HD. For instance, disturbances in monoaminergic transmission and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, increased oxidative and neuroinflammatory events, and impaired trophic support are thought to contribute to neuronal atrophy and death in all these diseases. In addition, neuroimaging findings have helped elucidate the structural and functional changes implicated in the relationship between depression and neurodegeneration, thus establishing a neuroanatomical signature to explain, at least in part, the comorbidity between MDD and AD, PD, and HD. The present review summarizes these findings and the current evidence regarding the effectiveness of common antidepressant therapies for the treatment of MDD in patients with these neurodegenerative diseases. This population is particularly vulnerable to the drawdowns of conventional antidepressant therapy (namely inadequate response and high risk of side effects), and the development of emerging therapeutic approaches to treat MDD in patients with AD, PD, and HD is thus of paramount importance to improve the quality of life of these individuals.",Cytokine Networks in the Pathophysiology of Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995511,Immunity,2019 04 17,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal tract.

Here we discuss the progression of IBD from the perspective of remodeling of cytokine networks. We place well-established and under-studied cytokine modules in the context of cellular interactions, their dynamic regulation in early and late stages of disease (i.e., fibrosis), and their current and potential use in the clinic.

Beyond discussing canonical antiviral functions, we consider the adaptive immune priming, anti-tumor, and autoimmune functions of IFNs. We discuss a model wherein type III IFNs serve as a front-line defense that controls infection at epithelial barriers while minimizing damaging inflammatory responses, reserving the more potent type I IFN response for when local responses are insufficient. In this context, we discuss current therapeutic applications targeting these cytokine pathways and highlight gaps in understanding of the biology of type I and type III IFNs in health and disease."

A between-subjects 2 × 3 design varied the serving size of the cake (6 oz. vs. 12 oz.) and the description of the cake (no description control, nutrition description, or sensory description). Self-reported amount eaten showed a smaller portion size effect in the nutrition description condition than in the other two conditions. Of primary interest, relative to the other conditions, the sensory description caused customers to be willing to pay as much for the small piece as for the large piece and to feel almost as full after eating from the small piece as from the large piece. These results indicate that a sensory rich description makes customers' evaluations of an indulgent dessert less sensitive to serving size. As a result, sensory descriptions can be used to make customers just as content with a small dessert as they would be with a large dessert.",Genome-Wide CRISPR-Cas9 Screens Expose Genetic Vulnerabilities and Mechanisms of Temozolomide Sensitivity in Glioblastoma Stem Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995489,Cell reports,2019 06 10,"Glioblastoma therapies have remained elusive due to limitations in understanding mechanisms of growth and survival of the tumorigenic population.

For quality assessment, we validated a subset of our interactions using MITOMI and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays. We combined our interactome with prior PPI data to generate an integrated Drosophila TF-TF binary interaction network. Our analysis of ChIP-seq data, integrating PPI and gene expression information, uncovered different modes by which interacting TFs are recruited to DNA. We further demonstrate the utility of our Drosophila interactome in shedding light on human TF-TF interactions. This study reveals how TFs interact to bind regulatory elements in vivo and serves as a resource of Drosophila TF-TF binary PPIs for understanding tissue-specific gene regulation.","Horizontal Boundary Cells, a Special Group of Somitic Cells, Play Crucial Roles in the Formation of Dorsoventral Compartments in Teleost Somite.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995487,Cell reports,2019 04 17,"Establishment of robust gene expression boundary is crucial for creating elaborate morphology during development. However, mechanisms underlying boundary formation have been extensively studied only in a few model systems. We examined the establishment of zic1/zic4-expression boundary demarcating dorsoventral boundary of the entire trunk of medaka fish (Oryzias latipes) and identified a subgroup of dermomyotomal cells called horizontal boundary cells (HBCs) as crucial players for the boundary formation. Embryological and genetic analyses demonstrated that HBCs play crucial roles in the two major events of the process, i.e., refinement and maintenance. In the refinement, HBCs could serve as a chemical barrier against Wnts from the neural tube by expressing Hhip. At later stages, HBCs participate in the maintenance of the boundary by differentiating into the horizontal myoseptum physically inhibiting cell mixing across the boundary. These findings reveal the mechanisms underlying the dorsoventral boundary in the teleost trunk by specialized boundary cells.",Quantitative Characterization of α-Synuclein Aggregation in Living Cells through Automated Microfluidics Feedback Control.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995486,Cell reports,2019 05 03,"Aggregation of α-synuclein and formation of inclusions are hallmarks of Parkinson's disease (PD).

We quantitatively analyzed α-synuclein inclusion formation and clearance in a yeast cell model of PD expressing either wild-type (WT) α-synuclein or the disease-associated A53T mutant from the galactose (Gal)-inducible promoter. A computer-controlled microfluidics device regulated α-synuclein in cells by means of closed-loop feedback control. We demonstrated that inclusion formation is strictly concentration dependent and that the aggregation threshold of the A53T mutant is about half of the WT α-synuclein (56%). We chemically modulated the proteasomal and autophagic pathways and demonstrated that autophagy is the main determinant of A53T α-synuclein inclusions' clearance. In addition to proposing a technology to overcome current limitations in dynamically regulating protein expression levels, our results contribute to the biology of PD and have relevance for therapeutic applications.",Essential Roles of Tbr1 in the Formation and Maintenance of the Orientation-Selective J-RGCs and a Group of OFF-Sustained RGCs in Mouse.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995485,Cell reports,2019 06 15,"In the mouse retina, more than 30 retinal ganglion cell (RGC) subtypes have been classified based on a combined metric of morphological and functional characteristics. RGCs arise from a common pool of retinal progenitor cells during embryonic stages and differentiate into mature subtypes in adult retinas. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms controlling formation and maturation of such remarkable cellular diversity remain unknown. Here, we demonstrate that T-box transcription factor T-brain 1 (Tbr1) is expressed in two groups of morphologically and functionally distinct RGCs: the orientation-selective J-RGCs and a group of OFF-sustained RGCs with symmetrical dendritic arbors. When Tbr1 is genetically ablated during retinal development, these two RGC groups cannot develop. Ectopically expressing Tbr1 in M4 ipRGCs during development alters dendritic branching and density but not the inner plexiform layer stratification level. Our data indicate that Tbr1 plays critical roles in regulating the formation and dendritic morphogenesis of specific RGC types.",The Exchangeable Apolipoprotein Nplp2 Sustains Lipid Flow and Heat Acclimation in Drosophila.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995484,Cell reports,2019 04 17,"In ectotherms, increased ambient temperature requires the organism to consume substantial amounts of energy to sustain a higher metabolic rate, prevent cellular damage, and respond to heat stress. Here, we identify a heat-inducible apolipoprotein required for thermal acclimation in Drosophila. Neuropeptide-like precursor 2 (Nplp2) is an abundant hemolymphatic protein thought to be a neuropeptide. In contrast, we show that Nplp2 contributes to lipid transport, functioning as an exchangeable apolipoprotein. More precisely, Nplp2-deficient flies accumulate lipids in their gut, have reduced fat stores, and display a dyslipoproteinemia, showing that Nplp2 is required for dietary lipid assimilation. Importantly, Nplp2 is induced upon thermal stress and contributes to survival upon heat stress. We propose that Nplp2 associates with lipoprotein particles under homeostatic and high energy-demand conditions to optimize fat transport and storage. Our study also shows that modulation of the lipid uptake and transport machinery is part of an integrated cytoprotective response."

To understand the roles that lncRNAs may play in hematopoiesis, we selected a subset of mouse lncRNAs with potentially relevant expression patterns and refined our candidate list using evidence of conserved expression in human blood lineages. For each candidate, we assessed its possible role in hematopoietic differentiation in vivo using competitive transplantation. Our studies identified two lncRNAs that were required for hematopoiesis. One of these, Spehd, showed defective multilineage differentiation, and its silencing yielded common myeloid progenitors that are deficient in their oxidative phosphorylation pathway. This effort not only suggests that lncRNAs can contribute to differentiation decisions during hematopoiesis but also provides a path toward the identification of functional lncRNAs in other differentiation hierarchies.",Single-Cell RNA-Sequencing-Based CRISPRi Screening Resolves Molecular Drivers of Early Human Endoderm Development.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995470,Cell reports,2019 05 21,"Studies in vertebrates have outlined conserved molecular control of definitive endoderm (END) development. However, recent work also shows that key molecular aspects of human END regulation differ even from rodents. Differentiation of human embryonic stem cells (ESCs) to END offers a tractable system to study the molecular basis of normal and defective human-specific END development. Here, we interrogated dynamics in chromatin accessibility during differentiation of ESCs to END, predicting DNA-binding proteins that may drive this cell fate transition. We then combined single-cell RNA-seq with parallel CRISPR perturbations to comprehensively define the loss-of-function phenotype of those factors in END development. Following a few candidates, we revealed distinct impairments in the differentiation trajectories for mediators of TGFβ signaling and expose a role for the FOXA2 transcription factor in priming human END competence for human foregut and hepatic END specification.

We report that T cell-specific deletion of Keap1 results in defective development and reduced numbers of invariant natural killer T (NKT) cells in the thymus and the peripheral organs in a cell-intrinsic manner. The frequency of NKT2 and NKT17 cells increases while NKT1 decreases in these mice. Keap1-deficient NKT cells show increased rates of proliferation and apoptosis, as well as increased glucose uptake and mitochondrial function, but reduced ROS, CD122, and Bcl2 expression. In NKT cells deficient in Nrf2 and Keap1, all these phenotypic and metabolic defects are corrected. Thus, the Keap1-Nrf2 system contributes to NKT cell development and homeostasis by regulating cell metabolism.","Phenformin, But Not Metformin, Delays Development of T Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia/Lymphoma via Cell-Autonomous AMPK Activation.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995468,Cell reports,2019 05 04,"AMPK acts downstream of the tumor suppressor LKB1, yet its role in cancer has been controversial. AMPK is activated by biguanides, such as metformin and phenformin, and metformin use in diabetics has been associated with reduced cancer risk.

We report that T-cell-specific loss of AMPK-α1 caused accelerated growth of T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (T-ALL) induced by PTEN loss in thymic T cell progenitors. Oral administration of phenformin, but not metformin, delayed onset and growth of lymphomas, but only when T cells expressed AMPK-α1. This differential effect of biguanides correlated with detection of phenformin, but not metformin, in thymus. Phenformin also enhanced apoptosis in T-ALL cells both in vivo and in vitro. Thus, AMPK-α1 can be a cell-autonomous tumor suppressor in the context of T-ALL, and phenformin may have potential for the prevention of some cancers.",Visual Experience Regulates the Intrinsic Excitability of Visual Cortical Neurons to Maintain Sensory Function.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995467,Cell reports,2019 05 01,"This in vivo study shows that both intrinsic and sensory-evoked synaptic properties of layer 2/3 neurons in mouse visual cortex are modified by ongoing visual input.

We, therefore, suggest that cortical cells adjust their intrinsic excitability in an activity-dependent manner to compensate for changes in synaptic drive and maintain sensory network function.",The Vomeronasal System Can Learn Novel Stimulus Response Pairings.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995466,Cell reports,2019 04 17,"Behavioral responses can be classified as innate or learned and are often mediated by distinct neuronal pathways. In many animals, chemical cues are crucial for directing behaviors, and multiple chemosensory subsystems serve this purpose. The major subsystems in vertebrates are the main olfactory system (MOS) and the vomeronasal system (VNS). While the MOS has well-documented associative capabilities, the VNS is known for its role in mediating innate responses to sensory cues with clear ethological significance. However, it remains unknown whether the VNS can map arbitrary sensory activation to novel behavioral outputs. To address this question, we used several optogenetic strategies for selective vomeronasal activation and tested whether mice could associate stimulation patterns with particular reward locations. Our experiments indicate that mice can, indeed, exploit VNS activity to direct novel behavioral responses, implying that the VNS holds a substantial capacity for redirecting and adapting behavioral responses to given stimulation patterns.",Endocannabinoid Signaling Mediates Local Dendritic Coordination between Excitatory and Inhibitory Synapses.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995465,Cell reports,2019 04 17,"Dendritic inhibitory synapses are most efficient in modulating excitatory inputs localized on the same dendrite, but it is unknown whether their location is random or regulated. Here, we show that the formation of inhibitory synapses can be directed by excitatory synaptic activity on the same dendrite. We stimulated dendritic spines close to a GABAergic axon crossing by pairing two-photon glutamate uncaging with postsynaptic depolarization in CA1 pyramidal cells. We found that repeated spine stimulation promoted growth of a GABAergic bouton onto the same dendrite. The dendritic feedback signal required postsynaptic activation of DAGL, which produces the endocannabinoid 2-AG, and was mediated by CB1 receptors. We could also induce inhibitory bouton growth by local, brief applications of 2-AG. Our findings reveal a dendritic signaling mechanism to trigger growth of an inhibitory bouton at dendritic locations with strong excitatory synaptic activity, and this mechanism may serve to ensure inhibitory control over clustered excitatory inputs.",Simultaneous Live Imaging of Multiple Endogenous Proteins Reveals a Mechanism for Alzheimer's-Related Plasticity Impairment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995464,Cell reports,2019 04 26,"CaMKIIα is a central mediator of bidirectional synaptic plasticity, including long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD). To study how CaMKIIα movement during plasticity is affected by soluble amyloid-β peptide oligomers (Aβ), we used FingR intrabodies to simultaneously image endogenous CaMKIIα and markers for excitatory versus inhibitory synapses in live neurons. Aβ blocks LTP-stimulus-induced CaMKIIα accumulation at excitatory synapses. This block requires CaMKII activity, is dose and time dependent, and also occurs at synapses without detectable Aβ; it is specific to LTP, as CaMKIIα accumulation at inhibitory synapses during LTD is not reduced. As CaMKII movement to excitatory synapses is required for normal LTP, its impairment can mechanistically explain Aβ-induced impairment of LTP. CaMKII movement during LTP requires binding to the NMDA receptor, and Aβ induces internalization of NMDA receptors. However, surprisingly, this internalization does not cause the block in CaMKIIα movement and is observed for extrasynaptic, but not synaptic, NMDA receptors.",Rhythmic Food Intake Drives Rhythmic Gene Expression More Potently than the Hepatic Circadian Clock in Mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995463,Cell reports,2019 04 17,"Every mammalian tissue exhibits daily rhythms in gene expression to control the activation of tissue-specific processes at the most appropriate time of the day. Much of this rhythmic expression is thought to be driven cell autonomously by molecular circadian clocks present throughout the body. By manipulating the daily rhythm of food intake in the mouse, we here show that more than 70% of the cycling mouse liver transcriptome loses rhythmicity under arrhythmic feeding. Remarkably, core clock genes are not among the 70% of genes losing rhythmic expression, and their expression continues to exhibit normal oscillations in arrhythmically fed mice. Manipulation of rhythmic food intake also alters the timing of key signaling and metabolic pathways without altering the hepatic clock oscillations. Our findings thus demonstrate that systemic signals driven by rhythmic food intake significantly contribute to driving rhythms in liver gene expression and metabolic functions independently of the cell-autonomous hepatic clock."

Restriction endonucleases have been used as a paradigm for protein engineering, but successful cases are rare. Here, we present the results of a directed evolution approach to the engineering of a dimeric, blunt end cutting restriction enzyme NlaIV (GGN/NCC). Based on the remote similarity to EcoRV endonuclease, regions for random mutagenesis and in vitro evolution were chosen. The obtained variants cleaved target sites with an up to 100-fold kcat/KM preference for AT or TA (GGW/WCC) over GC or CG (GGS/SCC) in the central dinucleotide step, compared to the only ~17-fold preference of the wild-type enzyme. To understand the basis of the increased specificity, we determined the crystal structure of NlaIV. Despite the presence of DNA in the crystallization mix, the enzyme crystallized in the free form. We therefore constructed a computational model of the NlaIV-DNA complex. According to the model, the mutagenesis of the regions that were in the proximity of DNA did not lead to the desired specificity change, which was instead conveyed in an indirect manner by substitutions in the more distant regions.",Can Predicted Protein 3D Structures Provide Reliable Insights into whether Missense Variants Are Disease Associated?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995449,Journal of molecular biology,2019 06 10,"Knowledge of protein structure can be used to predict the phenotypic consequence of a missense variant. Since structural coverage of the human proteome can be roughly tripled to over 50% of the residues if homology-predicted structures are included in addition to experimentally determined coordinates, it is important to assess the reliability of using predicted models when analyzing missense variants. Accordingly, we assess whether a missense variant is structurally damaging by using experimental and predicted structures. We considered 606 experimental structures and show that 40% of the 1965 disease-associated missense variants analyzed have a structurally damaging change in the mutant structure. Only 11% of the 2134 neutral variants are structurally damaging. Importantly, similar results are obtained when 1052 structures predicted using Phyre2 algorithm were used, even when the model shares low (<40%) sequence identity to the template. Thus, structure-based analysis of the effects of missense variants can be effectively applied to homology models. Our in-house pipeline, Missense3D, for structurally assessing missense variants was made available at http://www.sbg.bio.ic.ac.uk/~missense3d.",Coating With Chitooligosaccharides Enhances the Cytokine Induction of Listeria ivanovii-Based Vaccine Strain.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995448,Journal of pharmaceutical sciences,2019 05 10,"Listeria ivanovi (LI) is an available live bacterial vaccine vector. This work attempted to coat LI-based vaccine candidates (LI-Rv0129c) with chitooligosaccharides (COSs) as an adjuvant to enhance the cellular immune responses induced. COS-bacteria composite was achieved by mixing the bacteria suspension with equal volume of COS solution, and this process accompanied with the increase of bacteria superficial zeta potential and formation of special superficial configurations. COS coating improved the ratio swallowed by the macrophage-like RAW264.7 cells from 0.54% to 2.88% (p < 0.001). In vivo, the COS-coated LI-Rv0129c strain did elicit significantly higher specific CD4+ IFN-γ, CD4+ TNF-α or CD8+ IFN-γ secretion (0.91%, 1.00%, 0.30%, respectively) than naked LI-Rv0129c (0.32%, 0.38%, 0.07%, respectively) (p < 0.01). These results demonstrated that COS is a promising adjuvant to enhance the protective cellular immune responses induced by LI-based vaccine strains. Our work provided a notion for developing adjuvant for Listeria and other bacterial vector-based vaccines.",Sex-specific differences in adult cognition and neuroplasticity following repeated combinatory stress and TrkB receptor antagonism in adolescence.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995444,Hormones and behavior,2019 05 25,"Evidence supports brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its primary receptor tyrosine-related kinase B (TrkB) as targets in the treatment of mood disorders. This study characterized the impact of a 10-day combinatory stress paradigm (alternating days of restraint stress and forced swim) and administration of the selective TrkB antagonist ANA-12 (0.5 mg/kg, i.p.) during adolescence in male and female Wistar rats on adulthood behavioral and neurochemical responses. The social interaction/preference (SIT/SP), and Y maze conditioned place preference (YMCPP) and passive avoidance tests (YMPAT), initiated on PND 62, served to determine sex-related behavioral responses. Results support reduced sociability in females in the SIT/SP, but no impact of ANA-12 to regulate sociability or social memory. Blockade of TrkB during adolescence facilitated YMCPP-related reward behavior in both sexes, and reduced YMPAT fear conditioning in females. Following behavioral testing, rats were exposed to 5-min acute forced swim and brains collected 2 h post swim to determine effects of adolescent TrkB blockade and stress exposure on neurochemical regulators of stress and plasticity. Findings show elevated glucocorticoid receptor (GR-) and TrkB-immunoreactivity (ir) in the amygdalar central nucleus, and GR-ir in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus of females compared to males. In the hippocampal CA1, BDNF-ir was lower in females versus males, and GR-ir was elevated in stress versus non-stress males. Together, we demonstrate that inherent sex-specific differences, which may modulate impact of adolescence stress exposure and TrkB inhibition, differentially affect male and female adulthood behavior and biochemical response profiles, suggesting that these responses are in part conditioned by prior experience.",Identification of novel and rare CYP21A2 variants in Chinese patients with congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995443,Clinical biochemistry,2019 06 13,21-hydroxylase deficiency (21-OHD) is the most common cause of congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to CYP21A2 gene mutation.

However salivary samples offer a non-invasive and easily accessible alternative which would improve point of care (POC) testing for inflammation. Two major challenges restrict the use of saliva: the influence of the oral environment on CRP and its local production; and collecting a standardised sample given patient-dependent salivary flow rates. Here we review the reported studies of salivary CRP in humans as a potential marker of systemic inflammation and how the challenges can be overcome. Salivary CRP currently poorly reflects systemic inflammation as it does not consistently and strongly correlate with serum CRP. The mean and one standard deviation reported R2 values are 0.53 ± 0.23 from 14 studies. An improved understanding of the key challenges and implemented solutions are needed to optimise salivary CRP use. Firstly, control for the effects of local oral inflammation. Screening for oral trauma is one option, however this could drastically limit the number of patients suitable for salivary CRP testing and the number of professionals able to use the POC test. Secondly, the role of a dilution biomarker is considered controlling for salivary flow rate which dilutes serum CRP by ~104; a variable and likely-patient specific factor. The ideal dilution biomarker should have many of the pharmacokinetic, sensitivity and specificity characteristics of CRP. The potential for positive acute phase protein serum amyloid A (SAA) and negative acute phase protein albumin is considered and the characteristics of any correction function discussed. Currently, however, there are no available strategies to make salivary CRP a reliable quantitative measure of serum CRP and hence POC systemic inflammation testing.",Scorpion venom increases acetylcholine release by prolonging the duration of somatic nerve action potentials.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995441,Neuropharmacology,2019 05 31,"Scorpionism is frequently accompanied by a massive release of catecholamines and acetylcholine from peripheral nerves caused by neurotoxic peptides present in these venoms, which have high specificity and affinity for ion channels. Tityus bahiensis is the second most medically important scorpion species in Brazil but, despite this, its venom remains scarcely studied, especially with regard to its pharmacology on the peripheral (somatic and autonomic) nervous system. Here, we evaluated the activity of T. bahiensis venom on somatic neurotransmission using myographic (chick and mouse neuromuscular preparations), electrophysiological (MEPP, EPP, resting membrane potentials, perineural waveforms, compound action potentials) and calcium imaging (on DRG neurons and muscle fibres) techniques. Our results show that the major toxic effects of T. bahiensis venom on neuromuscular function are presynaptically driven by the increase in evoked and spontaneous neurotransmitter release. Low venom concentrations prolong the axonal action potential, leading to a longer depolarization of the nerve terminals that enhances neurotransmitter release and facilitates nerve-evoked muscle contraction. The venom also stimulates the spontaneous release of neurotransmitters, probably through partial neuronal depolarization that allows calcium influx. Higher venom concentrations block the generation of action potentials and resulting muscle twitches. These effects of the venom were reversed by low concentrations of TTX, indicating voltage-gated sodium channels as the primary target of the venom toxins. These results suggest that the major neuromuscular toxicity of T. bahiensis venom is probably mediated mainly by α- and β-toxins interacting with presynaptic TTX-sensitive ion channels on both axons and nerve terminals.",Fractional turnover of apolipoprotein(a) and apolipoprotein B-100 within plasma lipoprotein(a) particles in statin-treated patients with elevated and normal Lp(a) concentration.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995439,Metabolism: clinical and experimental,2019 06 15,"Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] is a highly atherogenic lipoprotein characterized by apolipoprotein(a) [apo(a)] covalently bounded to apoB-100 (apoB).

Geniposide (GEN), an iridoid glycoside isolated from Gardenia jasminoides Ellis, has been used for the treatment of IS. However, the effects of GEN on the BBB are poorly understood. In vitro disease models of the BBB could be very helpful for the elucidation of underlying mechanisms and the development of novel therapeutic strategies. Therefore, we established an in vitro BBB model composed of primary cultures of brain microvascular endothelial cells and astrocytes. We then used this in vitro model to investigate the effect of GEN on the function of the BBB. Oxygen glucose deprivation and reoxygenation (OGD/R) significantly increased permeability and cell apoptosis in this in vitro BBB model. Notably, GEN pretreatment effectively improved the BBB function by decreasing the permeability of the BBB, promoting expression of tight junction proteins (zonula occludens-1, claudin-5, and occludin) and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, increasing transendothelial electrical resistance, mitigating oxidative stress damage and the release of inflammatory cytokines, downregulating the expression levels of matrix metallopeptidases-9 (MMP-9) and MMP-2, and increasing the release of brain derived neurotrophic factor and glial cell derived neurotrophic factor. Therefore, GEN can ameliorate the BBB dysfunction induced by OGD/R conditions through multiple protective mechanisms. The findings suggest that GEN may be an appropriate drug for restoring the barrier function of the BBB.",Artesunate protects against surgery-induced knee arthrofibrosis by activating Beclin-1-mediated autophagy via inhibition of mTOR signaling.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995437,European journal of pharmacology,2019 05 24,"Intraarticular fibrosis following knee surgery is a troublesome complication and remains a challenging problem for clinicians. Artesunate (ART), a classical anti-malarial drug extracted from the Chinese medicinal herb Artemisia annua L, has been associated with some fibrosis-related diseases. However, its effect and underlying mechanism on knee arthrofibrosis are still obscure. In the present study, we found that ART induced cellular autophagy flux and inhibited cell proliferation in fibroblasts. Intriguingly, genetic depletion of Beclin-1 abolished ART-triggered cellular autophagy and further attenuated the inhibitory effect of ART on fibroblasts proliferation. Moreover, at molecular level, our results demonstrated that ART-induced autophagy activation was associated with the inhibition of mTOR signaling through PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway and AMPK/mTOR pathway. In vivo, ART treatment triggered autophagy activation and alleviated the severity of surgery-induced knee arthrofibrosis. Taken together, we concluded that ART exhibited anti-proliferation efficacy in fibroblasts and alleviated the severity of knee arthrofibrosis in rabbits by inducing Beclin-1-mediated autophagy via inhibition of mTOR signaling. These findings indicated that ART might be a potential therapeutic agent for preventing the progression of surgery-induced intraarticular fibrosis of knee."

The current methods of detection of white root rot are based on microbial and molecular techniques, and their application at orchard scale is limited. In this study, physiological parameters provided by imaging techniques were analyzed by machine learning methods. Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and normalized canopy temperature (canopy temperature - air temperature) were tested as predictors of disease by several algorithms. Among them, logistic regression analysis (LRA) trained on NDVI data showed the highest sensitivity and lowest rate of false negatives. This algorithm based on NDVI could be a quick and feasible method to detect trees potentially affected by white root rot in avocado orchards.",Control of Wheat Fusarium Head Blight by Heat-Stable Antifungal Factor (HSAF) from Lysobacter enzymogenes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995421,Plant disease,2019 06 06,"Heat-stable antifungal factor (HSAF), which belongs to the polycyclic tetramate macrolactam family, was isolated from Lysobacter enzymogenes fermentations and exhibited inhibitory activities against a wide range of fungal pathogens. In this study, the antifungal activity of HSAF against Fusarium graminearum in vitro and in vivo was investigated. A total of 50% of mycelial growth of F. graminearum was suppressed with 4.1 μg/ml of HSAF (EC50 value). HSAF treatment resulted in abnormal morphology of the hyphae, such as curling, apical swelling, and depolarized growth. Furthermore, HSAF adequately inhibited conidial germination and conidiation of F. graminearum with an inhibition rate of 100% when 1 and 6 μg/ml of HSAF were applied, respectively. HSAF caused ultrastructural changes of F. graminearum, including cell wall thickening and plasmolysis. Moreover, the application of HSAF significantly controlled Fusarium head blight in wheat caused by F. graminearum in the field. Overall, these results indicate that HSAF has potential for development as a fungicide against F. graminearum.","Boscalid Resistance in Blumeriella jaapii: Distribution, Effect on Field Efficacy, and Molecular Characterization.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995420,Plant disease,2019 06 06,"Cherry leaf spot (CLS), caused by the fungus Blumeriella jaapii, is a major disease of tart cherry (Prunus cerasus L.) trees, leading to early defoliation that results in uneven ripening and poor fruit quality in the current season, reduced fruit set in the following season, and increased potential for winter injury and tree death. Pristine (BASF Corporation, Research Triangle Park, NC), a commonly used fungicide for CLS management in Michigan, is a premix of boscalid, a succinate dehydrogenase inhibitor, and pyraclostrobin, a quinone outside inhibitor. Reduced efficacy of Pristine for CLS control was observed in field trials and commercial orchards and highlights the importance of fungicide resistance monitoring. A total of 1,189 isolates from 31 commercial orchards in Michigan, 111 isolates from nontreated trees (four locations in Michigan and two locations in Ohio), and 133 isolates from a research orchard were collected during 2010, 2011, and 2012 and assayed on boscalid-amended media at concentrations ranging from 0 to 25 μg ml-1. Because of the very slow growth rate of B. jaapii in culture, we determined the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of boscalid as opposed to the effective concentration that inhibits mycelial growth to 50% of the control. Isolates from nontreated trees had MIC values ranging from 0.1 to 0.5 μg ml-1; the MIC of isolates from commercial orchards ranged from 0.1 to >25 μg ml-1, and isolates from the research orchard ranged from 2.5 to >25 μg ml-1. Isolates with MIC values ≥25 μg ml-1 were considered boscalid resistant and comprised 0% of the nontreated isolates, 30.4% of the commercial isolates, and 42.1% of the research orchard isolates. Sequencing of the sdhB gene of resistant isolates led to the detection of the amino acid mutation H260R, which is known to confer boscalid resistance in other phytopathogenic fungi. Our results indicate that the occurrence of the H260R mutation in Michigan populations of B. jaapii is correlated with the reduction in sensitivity to boscalid observed in commercial orchards.",Expanding Knowledge of the Host Range of Tomato chlorosis virus and Host Plant Preference of Bemisia tabaci MEAM1.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995419,Plant disease,2019 06 06,"The crinivirus Tomato chlorosis virus (ToCV) is often found infecting tomato crops in Brazil, with variable incidence, but associated with prevalence of its primary vector, Bemisia tabaci MEAM1. ToCV control is difficult because there are no resistant commercial tomato varieties or hybrids available and chemical spray for control of the whitefly vector has not been effective. The present study evaluated the partial host range of a Brazilian isolate of ToCV and the preference of B. tabaci MEAM1 for oviposition on those species identified as susceptible to the virus. Subsequently, transmission tests were performed using plants of each ToCV host species as sources of inoculum to elucidate the epidemiological importance of nontomato sources of inoculum for infection of tomato. Among 80 species experimentally inoculated, 25 were susceptible, including 6 previously not known to be hosts (Jaltomata procumbens, Physalis pruinosa, Solanum aculeatissimum, S. viarum, Beta vulgaris var. cicla, and Chenopodium quinoa). Preference of whitefly for oviposition and infection by ToCV under free-choice transmission tests varied among the susceptible species. When ToCV-infected tomato, eggplant, and C. quinoa were used separately as sources of inoculum for virus transmission to tomato plants, mean percentages of infected plants were 76.6, 3, and 0%, respectively. Average oviposition of Bemisia tabaci on these three hosts were 2.7, 10.6, and 0.0 eggs/cm2, respectively. Additional studies will be necessary to evaluate the importance of ToCV host plants under field conditions and their efficiency as sources of inoculum for virus acquisition and transmission to tomato crops.",Time-restricted release of multiple neurotrophic factors promotes axonal regeneration and functional recovery after peripheral nerve injury.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995417,FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology,2019 04 17,"Delivery of multiple neurotrophic factors (NTFs), especially with time-restricted release kinetics, holds great potential for nerve repair. In this study, we utilized the tetracycline-regulatable Tet-On 3G system to control the expression of c-Jun, which is a common regulator of multiple NTFs in Schwann cells (SCs). In vitro, Tet-On/c-Jun-modified SCs showed a tightly controllable secretion of multiple NTFs, including glial cell line-derived NTF, nerve growth factor, brain-derived NTF, and artemin, by the addition or removal of doxycycline (Dox). When Tet-On/c-Jun-transduced SCs were grafted in vivo, the expression of NTFs could also be regulated by oral administration or removal of Dox. Fluoro-Gold retrograde tracing results indicated that a biphasic NTF expression scheme (Dox+3/-9, NTFs were up-regulated for 3 wk and declined to physiologic levels for another 9 wk) achieved more axonal regeneration than continuous up-regulation of NTFs (Dox+12) or no NTF induction (Dox-12). More importantly, the Dox+3/-9-group animals showed much better functional recovery than the animals in the Dox+12 and Dox-12 groups. Our findings, for the first time, demonstrated drug-controllable expression of multiple NTFs in nerve repair cells both in vitro and in vivo. These findings provide new hope for developing an optimal therapeutic alternative for nerve repair through the time-restricted release of multiple NTFs using Tet-On/c-Jun-modified SCs.-Huang, L., Xia, B., Shi, X., Gao, J., Yang, Y., Xu, F., Qi, F., Liang, C., Huang, J., Luo, Z.

Recently, UHRF1 was shown to have a role in DNA methylation in oocytes and early embryos. Here, we reveal that maternal UHRF1 determines the quality of mouse oocytes. We generated oocyte-specific Uhrf1-knockout mice and found that females were sterile, and few maternal UHRF1-null embryos developed into blastocysts. The UHRF1-null oocytes had an increased incidence of aneuploidy and DNA damage. In addition to defective DNA methylation, histone modification was affected during oogenesis, with UHRF1-null germinal vesicle and metaphase II-stage oocytes exhibiting reduced global histone H3 lysine 9 dimethylation levels and elevated acetylation of histone H4 lysine 12. Taken together, our results suggest that UHRF1 plays an important role in determining oocyte quality and affects epigenetic regulation of oocyte maturation as a maternal protein, which is crucial for embryo developmental potential. Further exploration of the biologic function and underlying mechanisms of maternal UHRF1 will enhance our understanding of the maternal control of the oocyte and early embryonic development.-Cao, Y., Li, M., Liu, F., Ni, X., Wang, S., Zhang, H., Sui, X., Huo, R.

Because of promising applications in catalysis and energy storage, 2D transition-metal carbides (TMCs) have attracted considerable attention in recent years. Among these TMCs, ultrathin crystalline α-Mo2C flakes have been fabricated by chemical vapor deposition on Cu/Mo bilayer foils, and their 2D superconducting property was revealed by transport measurements. Herein, we studied the ultrathin α-Mo2C flakes by atomic-resolved scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/S). Strain-related structural modulation and the coexistence of different layer-stacking modes are observed on the Mo-terminated surface of α-Mo2C flakes as well as various lattice defects. Furthermore, an enhanced superconductivity with shorter correlation length was observed by STS technique, and such superconductivity is very robust despite the appearance of the defects. A mechanism of superconducting enhancement is proposed based on the strain-induced strong coupling and the increased disordering originated from lattice defects. Our results provide a comprehensive understanding of the correlations between atomic structure, defects, and enhanced superconductivity of this emerging 2D material.",Bile Acid Binding Protein Functionalization Leads to a Fully Synthetic Rhodopsin Mimic.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995409,The journal of physical chemistry letters,2019 05 02,"Rhodopsins are photoreceptive proteins using light to drive a plethora of biological functions such as vision, proton and ion pumping, cation and anion channeling, and gene and enzyme regulation. Here we combine organic synthesis, NMR structural studies, and photochemical characterization to show that it is possible to prepare a fully synthetic mimic of rhodopsin photoreceptors. More specifically, we conjugate a bile acid binding protein with a synthetic mimic of the rhodopsin protonated Schiff base chromophore to achieve a covalent complex featuring an unnatural protein host, photoswitch, and photoswitch-protein linkage with a reverse orientation. We show that, in spite of its molecular-level diversity, light irradiation of the prepared mimic fuels a photochromic cycle driven by sequential photochemical and thermal Z/E isomerizations reminiscent of the photocycles of microbial rhodopsins."

In addition, it is expressed at high levels in many human tumors, such as breast cancer. Therefore, it is considered to be a potential target in cancer treatment. In order to detect intracellular NQO1 activity in MCF-7 aggregates as a cancer model, we present, in this study, a double-mediator system combined with large-scale integration (LSI)-based amperometric devices. This LSI device contained 20 × 20 Pt working electrodes with a 250 μm pitch for electrochemical imaging. In the detection system, menadione (MD) and [Fe(CN)6]3- were used. Since MD can diffuse into cells due to its hydrophobicity, it is reduced into menadiol by intracellular NQO1. The menadiol diffuses out of the cells and reduces [Fe(CN)6]3- of a hydrophilic mediator into [Fe(CN)6]4-. The accumulated [Fe(CN)6]4- outside the cells is electrochemically detected at 0.5 V in the LSI device. Using this strategy, the intracellular NQO1 activity of MCF-7 aggregates was successfully detected. The effect of rotenone, which is an inhibitor for Complex I, on NQO1 activity was also investigated. In addition, NQO1 and respiration activities were simultaneously imaged using the detection system that was further combined with electrochemicolor imaging. Thus, the double-mediator system was proven to be useful for evaluating intracellular redox activity of cell aggregates.",Accuracy of Valuations of Surgical Procedures in the Medicare Fee Schedule.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995374,The New England journal of medicine,2019 06 10,The Relative Value Scale Update Committee (RUC) of the American Medical Association plays a central role in determining physician reimbursement.

The stabilization of PS cell self-renewal in serum-free medium and ERK blockade might be critical for capturing primate chimera-competent pluripotency. It has recently been shown that shielding primate cells from the activation of ERK, WNT, and PKC signaling is crucial for deriving African green monkey ERK-independent PS cells. Here, I show that this principle is generalizable to human cells. In this chapter, methods are provided to reset conventional human PS cells to ERK-independence using histone deacetylase inhibitors and PGCX media comprised of N2B27 medium supplemented with LIF, PD0325901, Go6983, CHIR99021, and XAV939.

As with their protio analogues, the deuterated compounds were found to remain exclusively in the enolic form. The antiproliferative activities of these compounds were studied by in vitro bioassays against a panel of 60 cancer cell lines, and more specifically in human colorectal cancer (CRC) cells (HCT116, HT29, DLD-1, RKO, SW837, and Caco2) and in normal colon cells (CCD841CoN). The deuterated CUR-BF2 adducts exhibited better overall growth inhibition by NCI-60 assay, while for other CUR-BF2 adducts the non-deuterated analogues were more cytotoxic. Results of the more focused comparative cell viability assays followed the same trend, but with some variation depending on cell lines. The CUR-BF2 adducts exhibited significantly higher cytotoxicity than CURs. Structural studies (X-ray and DFT) and computational molecular docking calculations comparing their inhibitory efficacy with those of known anticancer agents used in chemotherapy are also reported."

However, the role of the VDR in breast cancer metastasis to bone, and the molecular mechanisms underlying this process are unknown. Employing a rodent model (female Balb/c nu/nu mice) of systemic metastasis, we here demonstrate that knock-down of the VDR strongly increases the metastatic potential of MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells to bone, resulting in significantly greater skeletal tumour burden. Ablation of VDR expression promotes cancer cell mobility (migration) and invasiveness, thereby facilitating skeletal colonisation. Mechanistically, these changes in tumour cell behaviour are attributable to shifts in the expression of proteins involved in cell adhesion, proliferation and cytoskeletal organisation, patterns characteristic for epithelial to mesenchymal cell transition (EMT). In keeping with these experimental findings, analyses of human breast cancer specimens corroborated the association between VDR expression, EMT-typical changes in protein expression patterns, and clinical prognosis. Loss of the VDR in human breast cancer cells marks a critical point in oncogenesis by inducing epithelial-to-mesenchymal cell transition, promoting the dissemination of cancer cells and facilitating the formation of tumour colonies in bone.

In total, 768 male broilers were distributed according to a completely randomized design with 6 treatments and 8 replicates of 16 birds each. The treatments were mash and pelleted diets provided ad libitum, or pelleted and supplied at the same rate (100%) or restricted at 95, 90, and 85% (P100, P95, P90, and P85) of the amount consumed by the birds fed mash diet ad libitum. When supplied ad libitum, the pelleted diet had the highest feed intake and weight gain (WG), better feed conversion ratio (FCR), better feed conversion adjusted for 2.3 kg (AdjFCR, P < 0.001) and caloric conversion (P < 0.001); and higher amount of abdominal fat (P < 0.001) when compared to the control (mash ad libitum). However, there were no effects on nutrient digestibility (P > 0.05). When the pelleted feed was provided in the same amount as in the control group, there were no differences in any of the evaluated parameters (P > 0.05). Limiting pelleted diet to 95, 90, and 85% of free choice mash diet resulted in lower WG (P < 0.001). P90 and P95 treatments resulted in higher dry matter and crude protein digestibility and IDE in relation to the others (P < 0.001). Carcass yield was reduced (P < 0.05) in the birds fed P85 diet. The regression analysis between P100, P95, P90, and P85 showed a linear reduction in WG when restriction was increased (P < 0.01); however, there was a linear increase in the nutrient digestibility (P < 0.001). It is concluded that pelleting improves broiler performance, but these results depend on feed intake. The higher intake provided by pelleting can increase the amount of abdominal fat.

Cecal contents DNA was extracted and pyrosequencing was performed following a standard procedure. Pyrosequencing data were processed, and sequence reads were phylogenetically classified. Similarity of membership and structure in the communities were calculated. At the end of the study, the greatest COO effect was found in coccidia-challenged broilers, with an OE body weight of 1,889 ± 52.4 g with respect to 1,799 ± 36.2 g for CE (P < 0.01). Broiler cecal samples were consistent in that phylum Firmicutes and class Clostridia were highly prevalent; COO had no effect on these taxa levels between the 4 treatments (P > 0.05). A positive correlation (P < 0.01) was observed between the Firmicutes:Bacteriodetes phyla ratio against body weight at 35 D of age. This study provided both positive and negative correlations between broiler body weight against some bacterial groups identified, offering perspectives regarding bacterial groups and their impact on host health and metabolism.

A total of 20 growing ostriches, with almost similar body weight (73.4 to 75.8 kg), were individually distributed in outdoor paddocks of ≈ 24 m2 and were randomly allocated into 1 of the following 4 treatments: (1) control/basal diet, (2) low OTM (basal diet + 100 mg/bird/day OTM powder in water), (3) medium OTM (basal diet + 1 g/bird/day OTM powder in water), and (4) high OTM (basal diet + 2 g/bird/day OTM powder in water). The body weight gain and feed conversion efficiency were greater (P < 0.05) in ostriches receiving medium-OTM treatment compared to control during the overall phase of the experiment. Although whole carcass yield, the yield of parts, and the relative weights of internal organs were not affected by experimental treatments, supplementation of higher amounts of OTM (medium- and high-OTM) resulted in a decrease (P < 0.05) in the subcutaneous and abdominal fat contents. Medium- and high-OTM treatments increased (P < 0.05) the villus height/crypt depth ratio in the jejunum and ileum compared with control and low-OTM treatments. Moreover, ostriches receiving the medium-OTM had also higher total tract apparent digestibility of energy (P = 0.048), ether extract (P = 0.050), crude fiber (P = 0.063), and higher AMEn (P = 0.094) than the control group. Overall, supplementation of OTM at the level of 1 g/bird/day to the drinking water of growing ostriches fed diets containing the recommended levels of inorganic trace minerals could beneficially affect productive performance, nutrient digestibility, and intestinal morphology.","Assessing Zika Virus Transmission within Households during an Outbreak in Martinique, 2015-2016.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995296,American journal of epidemiology,2019 04 17,"Since 2015, Zika virus (ZIKV) has caused large epidemics in the Americas. Households are natural targets for control interventions, but quantifying the contribution of household transmission to overall spread is needed to guide policy. Here, we developed a modelling framework to evaluate this contribution and key epidemic features of the ZIKV epidemic in Martinique in 2015-2016 from the joint analysis of a household transmission study (N=68 households), a study in symptomatic pregnant women (N=281) and seroprevalence surveys in blood donors (N=457). We estimated that the probability of mosquito-mediated within-household transmission (from an infected member to a susceptible one) was 21% (95% Credible Interval (CrI): 5%, 51%) while the overall probability of infection from outside the household (i.e. in the community) was 39% (95% CrI: 27%, 50%). Overall, 50% (95% CrI: 43%, 58%) of the population was infected, with 22% (95% CrI: 5%, 46%) of infections acquired in households and 40% (95% CrI: 23%, 56%) being asymptomatic. The probability of presenting with Zika-like symptoms due to another cause was 16% (95% CrI: 10%, 23%). This study characterizes the contribution of household transmission in ZIKV epidemics and demonstrates the benefits of integrating multiple datasets to gain more insights on epidemic dynamics.",Effects of dietary energy and protein content and lipid source on growth performance and carcass traits in Pekin ducks.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995295,Poultry science,2019 04 17,"The present study was conducted to determine the impact of dietary energy and protein concentrations and lipid sources on growth performance and carcass traits of Pekin ducks. In Exp. 1, 15-day-old ducks (6 replicate pens, 60 ducks/pen) were randomly assigned to 4 dietary treatments with different metabolizable energy (ME) and crude protein (CP) concentrations (2,850 kcal/kg and 16%, 2,950 kcal/kg and 16.5%, 3,050 kcal/kg and 17.0%, and 3,150 kcal/kg and 17.5%) based on body weight (BW). In Exp. 2, 20-day-old ducks (4 replicate pens, 60 ducks/pen) were randomly allotted to 3 dietary fat sources (soybean oil, lard, and palm oil) with or without emulsifier in a 3 × 2 factorial arrangement. In Exp. 1, increasing ME and CP level improved (P < 0.05) body weight gain (BWG) and cost-to-gain ratio linearly, but reduced (P < 0.05) feed intake (FI) and feed-to-gain ratio (F/G) linearly. Breast skin thickness and liver redness (a*) value increased (P < 0.05) linearly with the increasing ME and CP level. In Exp. 2, no interactions between fat sources and emulsifier were observed. Feeding lard and palm oil diets increased (P < 0.05) final BW and BWG compared to soybean oil. Birds fed soybean oil and palm oil diets had lower (P < 0.05) FI compared to those fed lard diet. F/G in soybean oil and lard groups was higher (P < 0.05) compared to palm oil group. Birds in palm oil and lard groups had higher (P < 0.05) European production efficiency factor than those in soybean oil group. The addition of emulsifier increased (P < 0.05) BWG.

A wildlife corridor on the plains, composed of natural habitat, supports hosts of many ixodid species. Occasional wind (not lunar) tides and infrequent storm surges inundate coastal plain areas with hypersaline water from the Lower Laguna Madre, creating large areas of saline soil. Laboratory and field experiments and observations were used to identify relationships between salinity and other abiotic and biotic factors that influence ixodid distribution. Exposure of lone star tick, Amblyomma americanum (L.), and Rhipicephalus microplus (Canestrini) eggs to hypersaline water is lethal. Although intermittent hypersaline flooding kills ixodid eggs, saline soil was not particularly toxic. When relative humidity is relatively low, desiccation causes high egg mortality on dry soil, regardless of salinity. Substantial year-round populations of mud flat fiddler crabs, Uca rapax (Smith) (Decopoda: Ocypodidae), occur on saline soil and eliminated ≈80% of A. americanum egg masses overnight. On saline and low-salinity soils predatory formicids, including the red imported fire ant, Solenopsis invicta (Buren), were indifferent to the eggs. Saline soils were dominated by the sea ox-eye daisy, Borrichia frutescens (L.) DC, and its color allowed production of a GIS-based map. At least 24.4% of the wildlife corridor supports heavy stands of B. frutescens which is indicative of high U. rapax populations. Ixodid populations were negligible on heavy B. frutescens stands because of associated salt water toxicity, desiccation, and predation by U. rapax on eggs.","Maternal Cell Phone Use During Pregnancy, Pregnancy Duration And Fetal Growth In Four Birth Cohorts.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995291,American journal of epidemiology,2019 04 17,"Previous studies evaluating potential effects of prenatal exposure to radiofrequency fields from cell phones on birth outcomes are inconsistent. We explored if maternal cell phone use was associated with pregnancy duration and fetal growth. We used information from 55,507 pregnant women and their children from Denmark (1996-2002), the Netherlands (2003-2004), Spain (2003-2008) and Korea (2006-2011). Based on self-reported number of cell phone calls per day, exposure was grouped as none, low (reference level), intermediate, and high. We examined pregnancy duration (gestational age at birth, preterm/postterm birth), fetal growth (birth weight ratio, small/large for gestational age), and birth weight, low and high birth weight, and meta-analyzed cohort specific estimates. The intermediate exposure group had higher risk of giving birth at lower gestational age (Hazard Ratio=1.04, 95%CI 1.01, 1.07), and exposure-response relationships were found for shorter pregnancy duration (P<0.001) and preterm birth (P=0.003). We observed no association with fetal growth or birth weight. In conclusion, maternal cell phone use during pregnancy may be associated with shorter pregnancy duration and increased risk for preterm birth. Results should be interpreted with caution, as they may reflect stress during pregnancy or other residual confounding, rather than direct effect of cell phone exposure.",NK cells negatively regulate CD8 T cells via natural cytotoxicity receptor (NCR) 1 during LCMV infection.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995287,PLoS pathogens,2019 05 17,"Besides their function in recognizing cancerous and virally infected cells, natural killer (NK) cells have the potential to shape adaptive immune responses. However, the mechanisms employed by NK cells to negatively regulate virus-specific CD8 T cell responses remain to be fully defined. Using activating receptor natural cytotoxicity receptor (NCR) 1 deficient (NCR1gfp/gfp) mice, we found increased numbers of virus-specific CD8 T cells, leading to enhanced virus control during acute LCMV infection. Furthermore, virus-specific CD8 T cells were more activated in the absence of NCR1, resulting in exacerbated immunopathology, documented by weight loss, and superior virus control early during chronic LCMV infection. Transfer experiments of virus-specific CD8 T cells into NCR1 deficient hosts revealed a direct cross talk between NK and CD8 T cells. Studies on the splenic microarchitecture revealed pronounced disorganization of T cells in infected NCR1gfp/gfp mice, resulting in enhanced immunopathology and disruption of the T cell niche upon chronic LCMV infection. Our data show a novel pathway employed by NK cells to regulate antiviral CD8 T cell responses, namely direct recognition and elimination of activated CD8 T cells via NCR1 early during infection to protect the host from an overshooting T cell response.",Red color facilitates the detection of facial anger - But how much?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995286,PloS one,2019 05 05,"The color red seems to be consistently associated with the concept of anger. Beyond semantic associations, it has been suggested that the color red enhances our ability to perceive anger in faces. However, previous studies often lack proper color control or the results are confounded by the presence of several emotions. Moreover, the magnitude of the (potential) effect of red has not been quantified. To address these caveats, we quantified the effect of facial color and background color on anger with psychometric functions measured with the method-of-constant-stimuli while facial hue or surround hue was varied in CIELAB color space. Stimulus sequences were generated by morphing between neutral and angry faces. For the facial color, the average chromaticity of the faces was shifted by ΔE 12/20 in red, yellow, green and blue directions. For the background color, the hue was either neutral or saturated red, green or blue. Both facial redness and surround redness enhanced perceived anger slightly, by 3-4 morph-%. Other colors did not affect perceived anger. As the magnitude of the enhancement is generally small and the effect is robust only in a small subset of the participants, we question the practical significance of red in anger recognition.",Changes in sleep architecture in German Armed Forces personnel with posttraumatic stress disorder compared with depressed and healthy control subjects.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995285,PloS one,2019 05 05,This study compares the sleep architecture of patients with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) with that of both patients with depression and subjects with no mental disorder.

With this reproducible animal model of human African trypanosomiasis, brain cells (astrocytes, microglial cells, neurons) expressing the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) enzyme were revealed. Immunohistochemistry was achieved for each control and infected animal through eight coronal brain sections taken along the caudorostral axis of the brain (brainstem, cerebellum, diencephalon and telencephalon). Specific markers of astrocytes (anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein), microglial cells (anti-integrin alpha M) or neurons (anti-Neuronal Nuclei) were employed. The iNOS staining was present in neurons, astrocytes and microglial cells, but not in oligodendrocytes. Stained astrocytes and microglial cells resided mainly near the third cavity in the rostral part of brainstem (periaqueductal gray), diencephalon (thalamus and hypothalamus) and basal telencephalon. Stained neurons were scarce in basal telencephalon, contrasting with numerous iNOS-positive neuroglial cells. Contrarily, in dorsal telencephalon (neocortex and hippocampus), iNOS-positive neurons were plentiful, contrasting with the marked paucity of labelled neuroglial (astrocytes and microglial) cells. The dual distribution between iNOS-labelled neuroglial cells and iNOS-labelled neurons is a feature that has never been described before. Functionalities attached to such a divergent distribution are discussed.",Early prediction of neurological outcome after barbiturate coma therapy in patients undergoing brain tumor surgery.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995269,PloS one,2019 05 05,"After a difficult brain tumor surgery, refractory intracranial hypertension (RICH) may occur due to residual tumor or post-operative complications such as hemorrhage, infarction, and aggravated brain edema. We investigated which predictors are associated with prognosis when using barbiturate coma therapy (BCT) as a second-tier therapy to control RICH after brain tumor surgery. The study included adult patients who underwent BCT after brain tumor surgery between January 2010 and December 2016. The primary outcome was neurological status upon hospital discharge, which was assessed using the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS). In the study period, 4,296 patients underwent brain tumor surgery in total. Of these patients, BCT was performed in 73 patients (1.7%). Among these 73 patients, 56 (76.7%) survived to discharge and 25 (34.2%) showed favorable neurological outcomes (GOS scores of 4 and 5). Invasive monitoring of intracranial pressure (ICP) was performed in 60 (82.2%) patients, and revealed that the maximal ICP within 6 h after BCT was significantly lower in patients with favorable neurological outcome as well as in survivors (p = 0.008 and p = 0.028, respectively). Uncontrolled RICH (ICP ≥ 22 mm Hg within 6 h of BCT) was an important predictor of mortality after BCT (adjusted hazard ratio 12.91, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.788-59.749), and in particular, ICP ≥ 15 mm Hg within 6 h of BCT was associated with poor neurological outcome (adjusted odds ratio 9.36, 95% CI 1.664-52.614). Therefore, early-controlled ICP after BCT was associated with clinical prognosis. There were no significant differences in the complications associated with BCT between the two neurological outcome groups. No BCT-induced death was observed. The active and timely control of RICH may be beneficial for clinical outcomes in patients with RICH after brain tumor surgery.",The long-term effects of an implantable drop foot stimulator on gait in hemiparetic patients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995268,PloS one,2019 05 05,"Drop foot is a frequent abnormality in gait after central nervous system lesions. Different treatment strategies are available to functionally restore dorsal extension during swing phase in gait. Orthoses as well as surface and implantable devices for electrical stimulation of the peroneal nerve may be used in patients who do not regain good dorsal extension. While several studies investigated the effects of implanted systems on walking speed and gait endurance, only a few studies have focussed on the system's impact on kinematics and long-term outcomes. Therefore, our aim was to further investigate the effects of the implanted system ActiGait on gait kinematics and spatiotemporal parameters for the first time with a 1-year follow-up period. 10 patients were implanted with an ActiGait stimulator, with 8 patients completing baseline and follow-up assessments. Assessments included a 10-m walking test, video-based gait analysis and a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for health status. At baseline, gait analysis was performed without any assistive device as well as with surface electrical stimulation. At follow-up patients walked with the ActiGait system switched off and on. The maximum dorsal extension of the ankle at initial contact increased significantly between baseline without stimulation and follow-up with ActiGait (p = 0.018). While the spatio-temporal parameters did not seem to change much with the use of ActiGait in convenient walking speed, patients did walk faster when using surface stimulation or ActiGait compared to no stimulation at the 10-m walking test at their fastest possible walking speed. Patients rated their health better at the 1-year follow-up. In summary, a global improvement in gait kinematics compared to no stimulation was observed and the long-term safety of the device could be confirmed.",Dual RNA-seq of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola infecting rice reveals novel insights into bacterial-plant interaction.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995267,PloS one,2019 05 05,"The Gram-negative bacterium Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola (Xoc) is the causal agent of rice bacterial leaf streak (BLS), one of the most destructive diseases of rice (Oryza sativa L.) that is the important staple crop. Xoc can invade host leaves via stomata and wounds and its type three secretion system (T3SS) is pivotal to its pathogenic lifestyle. In this study, using a novel dual RNA-seq approach, we examined transcriptomes of rice and Xoc in samples inoculated with wild type Xoc GX01 and its T3SS defective strain (T3SD), to investigate the global transcriptional changes in both organisms. Compared with T3SD strain, rice inoculated with wild type Xoc GX01 resulted in significant expression changes of a series of plant defence related genes, including ones altered in plant signalling pathway, and downregulated in phenylalanine metabolism, flavonoid and momilactone biosynthesis, suggesting repression of plant defence response and reduction in both callose deposition and phytoalexin accumulation. Also, some known transcription activator-like effector (TALE) targets were induced by Xoc GX01, e.g. OsSultr3;6 which contributes to rice susceptibility. Some cell elongation related genes, including several expansin genes, were induced by GX01 too, suggesting that Xoc may exploit this pathway to weaken cell wall strength, beneficial for bacterial infection. On the other hand, compared with wild type, the T3SD strain transcriptome in planta was characterized by downregulation of ATP, protein and polysaccharide synthesis, and upregulation of antioxidation and detoxification related genes, revealing that T3SD strain faced serious starvation and oxidation stresses in planta without a functional T3SS. In addition, comparative global transcript profiles of Xoc in planta and in medium revealed an upregulation of virulence factor synthesis and secretion in planta in favour of bacterial infection. Collectively, this study provides a comprehensive representation of cross talk between the host and bacterial pathogen, revealing insights into the Xoc-rice pathogenic dynamic and reveals novel strategies exploited by this important pathogen to cause disease.",Infectivity enhances prediction of viral cascades in Twitter.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995266,PloS one,2019 05 05,"Models of contagion dynamics, originally developed for infectious diseases, have proven relevant to the study of information, news, and political opinions in online social systems. Modelling diffusion processes and predicting viral information cascades are important problems in network science. Yet, many studies of information cascades neglect the variation in infectivity across different pieces of information. Here, we employ early-time observations of online cascades to estimate the infectivity of distinct pieces of information. Using simulations and data from real-world Twitter retweets, we demonstrate that these estimated infectivities can be used to improve predictions about the virality of an information cascade. Developing our simulations to mimic the real-world data, we consider the effect of the limited effective time for transmission of a cascade and demonstrate that a simple model of slow but non-negligible decay of the infectivity captures the essential properties of retweet distributions. These results demonstrate the interplay between the intrinsic infectivity of a tweet and the complex network environment within which it diffuses, strongly influencing the likelihood of becoming a viral cascade.","The role of life experience in affecting persistence: A comparative study between free-ranging dogs, pet dogs and captive pack dogs.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995264,PloS one,2019 05 05,"Persistence in object manipulation has been consistently associated with problem-solving success and it is known to be affected, at the individual level, by life experience. Differences in life experiences are particularly poorly studied in the problem-solving context and mainly refer to the comparison between wild and captive animals. Dogs represent interesting study subjects, since dog populations differ widely in their life experiences. In this comparative study we investigated subjects' persistence when presenting a novel object containing food that could not be accessed (impossible task) to three dog populations with very diverse life experiences: free-ranging village dogs (in Morocco), pet dogs (in Vienna) and captive pack living dogs (Wolf Science Center-WSC). We found that pet dogs and captive dogs (WSC) were more manipulative and persistent than free-ranging dogs. The low persistence of free ranging-dogs is unlikely the effect of a lack of exposure to objects, since they are confronted with many human' artefacts in their environment daily. Instead, we suggest that the higher persistence of captive dogs and pet dogs in comparison to free-ranging dogs might be due to their increased experience of human-mediated object interaction. This provides subjects with a socially guided experience in manipulating and interacting with objects increasing their motivation to engage in such tasks.",Chronic kidney disease in patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in an urban cohort.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995263,PloS one,2019 05 05,"HIV-infected patients are at risk for developing chronic kidney disease (CKD), defined by estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <60 ml/min/1.73m2.

We employed concatenated gene-tree analyses and divergence dating approaches to investigate evolutionary relationships and biogeographic patterns of atractaspidines with a multi-locus data set consisting of three mitochondrial (16S, cyt b, and ND4) and two nuclear genes (c-mos and RAG1). We sampled 91 individuals from both atractaspidine genera (Atractaspis and Homoroselaps). Additionally, we used ancestral-state reconstructions to investigate fang and diet evolution within Atractaspidinae and its sister lineage (Aparallactinae). Our results indicated that current classification of atractaspidines underestimates diversity within the group. Diversification occurred predominantly between the Miocene and Pliocene. Ancestral-state reconstructions suggest that snake dentition in these taxa might be highly plastic within relatively short periods of time to facilitate adaptations to dynamic foraging and life-history strategies.","Causes of mortality in cases with extra nodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type: A cohort study.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995261,PloS one,2019 05 05,"Extra nodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma (ENKTL), nasal type is a rare and highly aggressive type of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) commonly presented in the nasal cavity or lymphatic system.

For many study populations, z-scores will differ if calculated from World Health Organization (WHO) growth standards or within-population references. The specific growth reference used may influence statistical estimates of growth outcomes and their determinants, with implications for biological inference. We examined factors associated with growth outcomes in a sample of 152 Tsimane children aged 0-36 months. The Tsimane are a subsistence-scale population in the Bolivian Amazon with high rates of infectious disease and growth faltering. To examine the influence of growth reference on statistical inferences, we constructed multiple plausible models from available infant, maternal, and household attributes. We then ran identical models for height-for-age (HAZ), weight-for-age (WAZ), and weight-for-height (WHZ), with z-scores alternately calculated from WHO and robust Tsimane Lambda-Mu-Sigma growth curves. The distribution of WHO relative to Tsimane HAZ scores was negatively skewed, reflecting age-related increases in lower HAZ. Standardized coefficients and significance levels generally agreed across WHO and Tsimane models, although the strength and significance of specific terms varied in some models. Age was strongly, negatively associated with HAZ and WAZ in nearly all WHO, but not Tsimane models, resulting in consistently higher R2 estimates. Age and weaning effects were confounded in WHO models. Biased estimates of determinants associated with WHO HAZ may be more extreme in small samples and for variables that are strongly age-patterned. Additional methodological considerations may be warranted when applying WHO standards to within-population studies, particularly for populations with growth patterns known to systematically deviate from those of the WHO reference sample."

Measurement of active BAT presence, activity, and volume are desirable for determining the efficacy of potential treatments intended to activate BAT. The repeatability of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) measurements of BAT presence, activity, and volume under controlled conditions has not been extensively studied. Eleven female volunteers underwent double baseline FDG PET imaging performed following a simple, regional cold intervention intended to activate brown fat. The cold intervention involved the lightly-clothed participants intermittently placing their feet on a block of ice while sitting in a cooled room. A repeat study was performed under the same conditions within a target of two weeks. FDG scans were obtained and maximum standardized uptake value adjusted for lean body mass (SULmax), CT Hounsfield units (HU), BAT metabolic volume (BMV), and total BAT glycolysis (TBG) were determined according to the Brown Adipose Reporting Criteria in Imaging STudies (BARCIST) 1.0. A Lin's concordance correlation (CCC) of 0.80 was found for BMV between test and retest imaging. Intersession BAT SULmax was significantly correlated (r = 0.54; p < 0.05). The session #1 mean SULmax of 4.92 ± 4.49 g/mL was not significantly different from that of session #2 with a mean SULmax of 7.19 ± 7.34 g/mL (p = 0.16). BAT SULmax was highly correlated with BMV in test and retest studies (r ≥ 0.96, p < 0.001). Using a simplified ice-block cooling method, BAT was activated in the majority (9/11) of a group of young, lean female participants. Quantitative assessments of BAT SUL and BMV were not substantially different between test and retest imaging, but individual BMV could vary considerably. Intrasession BMV and SULmax were strongly correlated. The variability in estimates of BAT activity and volume on test-retest with FDG should inform sample size choice in studies quantifying BAT physiology and support the dynamic metabolic characteristics of this tissue. A more sophisticated cooling method potentially may reduce variations in test-retest BAT studies.",Viable and necrotic tumor assessment from whole slide images of osteosarcoma using machine-learning and deep-learning models.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995247,PloS one,2019 05 05,"Pathological estimation of tumor necrosis after chemotherapy is essential for patients with osteosarcoma. This study reports the first fully automated tool to assess viable and necrotic tumor in osteosarcoma, employing advances in histopathology digitization and automated learning. We selected 40 digitized whole slide images representing the heterogeneity of osteosarcoma and chemotherapy response. With the goal of labeling the diverse regions of the digitized tissue into viable tumor, necrotic tumor, and non-tumor, we trained 13 machine-learning models and selected the top performing one (a Support Vector Machine) based on reported accuracy. We also developed a deep-learning architecture and trained it on the same data set. We computed the receiver-operator characteristic for discrimination of non-tumor from tumor followed by conditional discrimination of necrotic from viable tumor and found our models performing exceptionally well. We then used the trained models to identify regions of interest on image-tiles generated from test whole slide images. The classification output is visualized as a tumor-prediction map, displaying the extent of viable and necrotic tumor in the slide image. Thus, we lay the foundation for a complete tumor assessment pipeline from original histology images to tumor-prediction map generation. The proposed pipeline can also be adopted for other types of tumor.",Critical role of miR-10b in B-RafV600E dependent anchorage independent growth and invasion of melanoma cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995246,PloS one,2019 05 05,"Recent high-throughput-sequencing of cancer genomes has identified oncogenic mutations in the B-Raf genetic locus as one of the critical events in melanomagenesis. B-Raf encodes a serine/threonine kinase that regulates the MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) protein kinase cascade. In normal cells, the activity of B-Raf is tightly regulated and is required for cell growth and survival. B-Raf gain-of-function mutations in melanoma frequently lead to unrestrained growth, enhanced cell invasion and increased viability of cancer cells. Although it is clear that the invasive phenotypes of B-Raf mutated melanoma cells are stringently dependent on B-Raf-MEK-ERK activation, the downstream effector targets that are required for oncogenic B-Raf-mediated melanomagenesis are not well defined. miRNAs have regulatory functions towards the expression of genes that are important in carcinogenesis. We observed that miR-10b expression correlates with the presence of the oncogenic B-Raf (B-RafV600E) mutation in melanoma cells. While expression of miR-10b enhances anchorage-independent growth of B-Raf wild-type melanoma cells, miR-10b silencing decreases B-RafV600E cancer cell invasion in vitro. Importantly, the expression of miR-10b is required for B-RafV600E-mediated anchorage independent growth and invasion of melanoma cells in vitro. Taken together our results suggest that miR-10b is an important mediator of oncogenic B-RafV600E activity in melanoma.",Effect of modulating braille dot height on reading regressions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995244,PloS one,2019 05 05,"It is well known that people who read print or braille sometimes make eye or finger movements against the reading direction. The way these regressions are elicited has been studied in detail by manipulating linguistic aspects of the reading material. Actually, it has been shown that reducing the physical intensity or clarity of the visual input signal can also lead to increased regressions during reading. We asked whether the same might be true in the haptic realm while reading braille. We set the height of braille dots at three different levels (high, medium, and low) and asked adult blind, practiced braille readers to read standardized texts without any repetition of content. The results show that setting the braille dot height near the tactile threshold significantly increased the frequency of regressive finger movements. Additionally, at the lowest braille dot height, braille reading speed significantly diminished. These effects did not occur at braille dot heights that were closer to the height of standard braille (medium and high). We tentatively conclude that this effect may be due to a heightened sense of uncertainty elicited by perception near the threshold that seems to be common to the reading process, independent of the sensory input modality. Furthermore, the described effect may be a feature of a brain area that contributes to the reading process mediated by vision as well as touch.",Do intentionality constraints shape the relationship between motor variability and performance?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995243,PloS one,2019 05 05,"The aim of this experiment was to assess if the previously supported relationship between the structure of motor variability and performance changes when the task or organismic constraints encourage individuals to adjust their movement to achieve a goal. Forty-two healthy volunteers (aged 26.05 ± 5.02 years) performed three sets of cyclic pointing movements, 600 cycles each. Every set was performed under different conditions: 1) without a target; 2) with a target; 3) with a target and a financial reward. The amount of performance variability was analysed using the standard deviation of the medial-lateral (ML) and anterior-posterior (AP) axes and the bivariate variable error. The structure of the variability was assessed by Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA) of the following time series: the coordinate values of the endpoint in ML, AP axes and resultant distance (RD), the hand orientation and the movement time. The performance of the task constrained with a target, or a target and reward, required higher implication to adjust an individual's movements to achieve the task goal, showing a decrease in dispersions and lower autocorrelation. Under the condition without a target, variability dispersion was positively related to autocorrelation of the movement values from ML axis and RD time series, and negatively related to the values from the hand orientation time series. There was a loss of the relationship between variability structure and performance when the task was constrained by the target and the reward. That could indicate different strategies of the participants to achieve the objective. Considering the results and previous studies, the relationship between variability structure and performance could depend on task constraints such as feedback, difficulty or the skill level of participants and it is mediated by individual constraints such as implication or intentionality.",Verbal probabilities: Very likely to be somewhat more confusing than numbers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995242,PloS one,2019 05 05,"People interpret verbal expressions of probabilities (e.g. 'very likely') in different ways, yet words are commonly preferred to numbers when communicating uncertainty. Simply providing numerical translations alongside reports or text containing verbal probabilities should encourage consistency, but these guidelines are often ignored. In an online experiment with 924 participants, we compared four different formats for presenting verbal probabilities with the numerical guidelines used in the US Intelligence Community Directive (ICD) 203 to see whether any could improve the correspondence between the intended meaning and participants' interpretation ('in-context'). This extends previous work in the domain of climate science. The four experimental conditions we tested were: 1. numerical guidelines bracketed in text, e.g. X is very unlikely (05-20%), 2. click to see the full guidelines table in a new window, 3. numerical guidelines appear in a mouse over tool tip, and 4. no guidelines provided (control). Results indicate that correspondence with the ICD 203 standard is substantially improved only when numerical guidelines are bracketed in text. For this condition, average correspondence was 66%, compared with 32% in the control. We also elicited 'context-free' numerical judgements from participants for each of the seven verbal probability expressions contained in ICD 203 (i.e., we asked participants what range of numbers they, personally, would assign to those expressions), and constructed 'evidence-based lexicons' based on two methods from similar research, 'membership functions' and 'peak values', that reflect our large sample's intuitive translations of the terms. Better aligning the intended and assumed meaning of fuzzy words like 'unlikely' can reduce communication problems between the reporter and receiver of probabilistic information. In turn, this can improve decision making under uncertainty.",A computational solution to improve biomarker reproducibility during long-term projects.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995241,PloS one,2019 05 05,"Biomarkers are fundamental to basic and clinical research outcomes by reporting host responses and providing insight into disease pathophysiology. Measuring biomarkers with research-use ELISA kits is universal, yet lack of kit standardization and unexpected lot-to-lot variability presents analytic challenges for long-term projects. During an ongoing two-year project measuring plasma biomarkers in cancer patients, control concentrations for one biomarker (PF) decreased significantly after changes in ELISA kit lots. A comprehensive operations review pointed to standard curve shifts with the new kits, an analytic variable that jeopardized data already collected on hundreds of patient samples. After excluding other reasonable contributors to data variability, a computational solution was developed to provide a uniform platform for data analysis across multiple ELISA kit lots. The solution (ELISAtools) was developed within open-access R software in which variability between kits is treated as a batch effect. A defined best-fit Reference standard curve is modelled, a unique Shift factor ""S"" is calculated for every standard curve and data adjusted accordingly. The averaged S factors for PF ELISA kit lots #1-5 ranged from -0.086 to 0.735, and reduced control inter-assay variability from 62.4% to <9%, within quality control limits. S factors calculated for four other biomarkers provided a quantitative metric to monitor ELISAs over the 10 month study period for quality control purposes. Reproducible biomarker measurements are essential, particularly for long-term projects with valuable patient samples. Use of research-use ELISA kits is ubiquitous and judicious use of this computational solution maximizes biomarker reproducibility.",Detection of serum and salivary IgE and IgG1 immunoglobulins specific for diagnosis of food allergy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995240,PloS one,2019 05 05,"Given the growing incidence and prevalence of life-threatening food allergies, health concerns have raised new perspectives for in vivo and in vitro diagnostic methodologies, pointing to saliva as a promising material, already used to diagnose other pathologies. Based on the above considerations, this study aimed to verify the possible use of saliva for the detection of IgE and IgG1 in the diagnosis of food allergy. This was a randomized, cross-sectional clinical study with a quantitative approach, developed at a hospital referral center in allergy in the state of Ceará, from January to July 2015. The sample consisted of 36 children of both sexes, aged between 1 and 60 months, with a diagnosis of cow's milk protein allergy (CMPA) by the RAST test. Children hospitalized or under immunosuppressive drugs were excluded from the study. Serum and saliva samples of the participants were collected and subsequently subjected to the indirect immunoenzymatic assay (ELISA) for the detection of specific serum and salivary immunoglobulins for food: corn, papaya, cow's milk, egg white, wheat, soybeans, peanuts, nuts, kiwi, cacao, fish, shrimp, bananas and tomatoes. For comparison of serum and saliva results, the T-test of independent samples and Mann-Whitney were adopted, for samples with normal and non-normal distribution respectively. A confidence interval of 95% was adopted for significant results. It was observed that 100% (n = 36) of the participants presented cow's milk allergy through the indirect ELISA, detecting IgE or IgG1 in serum and saliva. When serum IgE and IgG1 concentrations were compared, there was no statistical difference (p > 0.05) in 12 of the 14 foods evaluated. The same amount (n = 12) of non-significant differences (p > 0.05) was observed in the comparison of the 14 foods under IgE and IgG1 contractions in saliva. In the verification of the average values of IgE present in the serum and saliva of the foods, only cow's milk, fish and papaya showed statistically significant differences (p < 0.05). Of the total food evaluated, only the average levels of IgG1 present in serum and saliva showed a significant value (p < 0.05) in banana and tomato. These findings indicate that the detection of IgE and IgG1 in saliva proves to be as efficient as in the serum. The use of the salivary technique for use in the diagnosis of food allergy is suggested.",TLR2/4 signaling pathway mediates sperm-induced inflammation in bovine endometrial epithelial cells in vitro.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995239,PloS one,2019 05 05,"We have recently shown that sperm attachment to bovine endometrial epithelial cells (BEECs) triggers uterine local innate immunity with induction of a pro-inflammatory response in vitro, however details of the mechanism remain unknown. Here, we investigated the involvement of Toll-like receptor 2/4 (TLR2/4) pathway in mediating sperm-BEECs inflammatory process. Immunohistochemistry of the uterine tissue revealed that TLR2 and TLR4 proteins were present in the luminal and glandular epithelia of bovine endometrium. Moreover, BEECs monolayers were treated with TLR2 agonist (Pam; 0, 10, 100, and 1000 ng/ml) or TLR4 agonist (LPS; 0, 0.1, 1, and 10 ng/ml) for 0, 1, 3, or 6 h, followed by evaluating mRNA expression of the pro-inflammatory genes (TNFA, IL-1B, IL-8, and PGES) in BEECs using a real-time PCR. Both Pam and LPS treatments showed a dose-dependent stimulation of mRNA expression of the pro-inflammatory genes. To elucidate the functional role of TLR2/4 in sperm-BEECs interaction, BEECs monolayers were incubated with either TLR2 antagonist or TLR4 antibody for 2 h prior to the co-culture with sperm for 3 h. Importantly, pre-incubation of BEECs with TLR2 antagonist or TLR4 antibody prevented the stimulatory effect of sperm on the transcription of pro-inflammatory genes in BEECs. Furthermore, sperm increased the phosphorylation levels of TLR2/4 downstream targets (p38MAPK and JNK) in BEECs within 1 h of the co-culture. Treatment of BEECs with TLR2 antagonist prior to sperm addition inhibited JNK phosphorylation, while TLR4 antibody inhibited the phosphorylation of both p38MAPK and JNK. In conclusion, the present in vitro findings strongly suggest that bovine endometrial epithelial cells respond to sperm via TLR2/4 signal transduction."

Numerous Picornaviridae members pose serious health or agricultural threats, causing diseases such as poliomyelitis, hepatitis A, or foot-and-mouth disease. The antigenic characterization of picornavirus capsids plays an important role in understanding the mechanism of viral neutralization and the conformational changes associated with genome release, and it can point to regions which can be targeted by small-molecule compounds to be developed as antiviral inhibitors. In a recent study, Cao and colleagues applied this strategy to hepatitis A virus (HAV) and used cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to characterize a well-conserved antigenic site recognized by several monoclonal antibodies. They further used computational approaches to identify a small-molecule drug with a strong inhibitory effect on cell attachment.",Changing paradigm of antibiotic resistance amongst Escherichia coli isolates in Indian pediatric population.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995225,PloS one,2019 05 05,"Antimicrobial resistance happens when microorganisms mutates in manners that render the drugs like antibacterial, antiviral, antiparasitic and antifungal, ineffective. The normal mutation process is encouraged by the improper use of antibiotics. Mutations leading to quinolone resistance occur in a highly conserved region of the quinolone resistance-determining region (QRDR) of DNA gyrAse and topoisomerase IV gene. We analyzed antibiotic resistant genes and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in gyrA and parC genes in QRDR in 120 E. coli isolates (both diarrheagenic and non-pathogenic) recovered from fresh stool samples collected from children aged less than 5 years from Delhi, India. Antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed according to standard clinical and laboratory standards institute (CLSI) guidelines. Phylogenetic analysis showed the clonal diversity and phylogenetic relationships among the E. coli isolates. The SNP analysis depicted mutations in gyrA and parC genes in QRDR. The sul1 gene, responsible for sulfonamide resistance, was present in almost half (47.5%) of the isolates across the diseased and healthy samples. The presence of antibiotic resistance genes in E. coli isolates from healthy children indicate the development, dissemination and carriage of antibiotic resistance in their gut. Our observations suggest the implementation of active surveillance and stewardship programs to promote appropriate antibiotic use and minimizing further danger.",Zika viruses of African and Asian lineages cause fetal harm in a mouse model of vertical transmission.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995223,PLoS neglected tropical diseases,2019 06 10,"Congenital Zika virus (ZIKV) infection was first linked to birth defects during the American outbreak in 2015/2016. It has been proposed that mutations unique to the Asian/American-genotype explain, at least in part, the ability of Asian/American ZIKV to cause congenital Zika syndrome (CZS). Recent studies identified mutations in ZIKV infecting humans that arose coincident with the outbreak in French Polynesia and were stably maintained during subsequent spread to the Americas. Here we show that African ZIKV can infect and harm fetuses and that the S139N substitution that has been associated with the American outbreak is not essential for fetal harm. Our findings, in a vertical transmission mouse model, suggest that ZIKV will remain a threat to pregnant women for the foreseeable future, including in Africa, Southeast Asia, and the Americas. Additional research is needed to better understand the risks associated with ZIKV infection during pregnancy, both in areas where the virus is newly endemic and where it has been circulating for decades.",Human collectin-11 (COLEC11) and its synergic genetic interaction with MASP2 are associated with the pathophysiology of Chagas Disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995222,PLoS neglected tropical diseases,2019 05 19,"Chagas Disease (CD) is an anthropozoonosis caused by Trypanosoma cruzi. With complex pathophysiology and variable clinical presentation, CD outcome can be influenced by parasite persistence and the host immune response. Complement activation is one of the primary defense mechanisms against pathogens, which can be initiated via pathogen recognition by pattern recognition molecules (PRMs). Collectin-11 is a multifunctional soluble PRM lectin, widely distributed throughout the body, with important participation in host defense, homeostasis, and embryogenesis. In complex with mannose-binding lectin-associated serine proteases (MASPs), collectin-11 may initiate the activation of complement, playing a role against pathogens, including T. cruzi. In this study, collectin-11 plasma levels and COLEC11 variants in exon 7 were assessed in a Brazilian cohort of 251 patients with chronic CD and 108 healthy controls. Gene-gene interactions between COLEC11 and MASP2 variants were analyzed. Collectin-11 levels were significantly decreased in CD patients compared to controls (p<0.0001). The allele rs7567833G, the genotypes rs7567833AG and rs7567833GG, and the COLEC11*GGC haplotype were related to T. cruzi infection and clinical progression towards symptomatic CD. COLEC11 and MASP2*CD risk genotypes were associated with cardiomyopathy (p = 0.014; OR 9.3, 95% CI 1.2-74) and with the cardiodigestive form of CD (p = 0.005; OR 15.2, 95% CI 1.7-137), suggesting that both loci act synergistically in immune modulation of the disease. The decreased levels of collectin-11 in CD patients may be associated with the disease process. The COLEC11 variant rs7567833G and also the COLEC11 and MASP2*CD risk genotype interaction were associated with the pathophysiology of CD.",Schwann cells ER-associated degradation contributes to myelin maintenance in adult nerves and limits demyelination in CMT1B mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995221,PLoS genetics,2019 05 19,"In the peripheral nervous system (PNS) myelinating Schwann cells synthesize large amounts of myelin protein zero (P0) glycoprotein, an abundant component of peripheral nerve myelin. In humans, mutations in P0 cause the demyelinating Charcot-Marie-Tooth 1B (CMT1B) neuropathy, one of the most diffused genetic disorders of the PNS. We previously showed that several mutations, such as the deletion of serine 63 (P0-S63del), result in misfolding and accumulation of P0 in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), with activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR). In addition, we observed that S63del mouse nerves display the upregulation of many ER-associated degradation (ERAD) genes, suggesting a possible involvement of this pathway in the clearance of the mutant P0. In ERAD in fact, misfolded proteins are dislocated from the ER and targeted for proteasomal degradation. Taking advantage of inducible cells that express the ER retained P0, here we show that the P0-S63del glycoprotein is degraded via ERAD. Moreover, we provide strong evidence that the Schwann cell-specific ablation of the ERAD factor Derlin-2 in S63del nerves exacerbates both the myelin defects and the UPR in vivo, unveiling a protective role for ERAD in CMT1B neuropathy. We also found that lack of Derlin-2 affects adult myelin maintenance in normal nerves, without compromising their development, pinpointing ERAD as a previously unrecognized player in preserving Schwann cells homeostasis in adulthood. Finally, we provide evidence that treatment of S63del peripheral nerve cultures with N-Acetyl-D-Glucosamine (GlcNAc), known to enhance protein quality control pathways in C.elegans, ameliorates S63del nerve myelination ex vivo. Overall, our study suggests that potentiating adaptive ER quality control pathways might represent an appealing strategy to treat both conformational and age-related PNS disorders.",Screen-time is associated with inattention problems in preschoolers: Results from the CHILD birth cohort study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995220,PloS one,2019 05 05,Pre-school children spend an average of two-hours daily using screens.

We hypothesised that environmental inputs including environmental complexity (i.e. number of environmental enrichment types provided), space allowance, underfloor heating (presence or absence), and photoperiod regimen (18 h continuous vs 16 h intermittent) would correspond to variations in welfare assessment findings, which would predict production outcomes. We conducted on-farm welfare assessment of Norwegian broiler flocks at approximately 28 days of age. We sampled four transects (rows between feeder and drinker lines) per flock to determine litter quality and the proportions of chickens with compromised welfare as indicated by visual signs of walking difficulties, illness, skin wounds and small bird size. Production outcome measures included mortality, reasons for carcass rejection at slaughter, footpad dermatitis, growth rate, feed conversion and an integrated production index. Greater environmental complexity was associated with a reduction in skin wounds and total welfare problems on the farm, lower mortality, fewer rejections due to wounds and underweight birds, and fewer rejections overall. Higher space allowances within levels of environmental complexity were associated with fewer walking difficulties and welfare problems overall, a reduction in rejections due to wounds, and a higher growth rate and production index. Underfloor heating was associated with a reduction in rejections due to leg deformity, and intermittent light was associated with lower illness and skin wound rates on the farm, and lower mortality. Furthermore, fewer welfare problems and better litter quality on the farm were associated with fewer carcass rejections at slaughter. Thus, data from transect sampling varied with environmental inputs and production outcomes, supporting the validity of transect sampling for practical, animal-based on-farm welfare assessment.",To pool or not to pool? Trends and predictors of banking arrangements within Australian couples.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995218,PloS one,2019 05 05,"The study of domestic money goes at the heart of debates about independence and equality in intimate relationships. It provides an important window on the individualization of family life and how couples reconcile ideals around egalitarian marriage ideologies with enduring gender inequality in society and the labor market. This study approaches these issues from the prism of couples' banking arrangements (separate vs. joint accounts), an aspect of financial organization that approximates the executive management of household resources and which has received comparatively little attention. As such, it is amongst the first to deploy large-scale, household panel data (Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia Survey, n = 15,379 observations from 7,054 couples) and binary and multinomial random-effect logistic regression models to examine trends over time in couples' banking arrangements and their socio-demographic predictors. Key findings indicate that a large share of couples in Australia favors 'mixed' bank account strategies (i.e., holding both joint and separate accounts), but 'egalitarian' choices (i.e., dual separate accounts) are prevalent and on the rise. Couples' bank account choices are influenced in theoretically-meaningful ways by economic resources, transaction costs, relationship history, gender-role attitudes, and family background.",Predicting synthetic lethal interactions using conserved patterns in protein interaction networks.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995217,PLoS computational biology,2019 05 28,"In response to a need for improved treatments, a number of promising novel targeted cancer therapies are being developed that exploit human synthetic lethal interactions.

Here we describe SLant (Synthetic Lethal analysis via Network topology), a computational systems approach to predicting human synthetic lethal interactions that works by identifying and exploiting conserved patterns in protein interaction network topology both within and across species. SLant out-performs previous attempts to classify human SSL interactions and experimental validation of the models predictions suggests it may provide useful guidance for future SSL screenings and ultimately aid targeted cancer therapy development.",Development of a modified method of handmade cloning in dromedary camel.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995216,PloS one,2019 05 05,"In this study, a modified method of handmade cloning (m-HMC), which had been originally developed in sheep, was used for somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) in the dromedary camel. The unique feature of m-HMC over current SCNT methods lies in the use of a simple device (a finely drawn micropipette made of Pasteur pipette) for chemically-assisted enucleation of oocytes under a stereomicroscope with improved efficiency and ease of operation. Using this system, the throughput of cloned embryo reconstitution was increased over 2-fold compared to the control SCNT method (c-NT). Stepwise measurement of reactive oxygen species (ROS) revealed that method, steps, and duration of SCNT all influenced oxidative activity of oocytes, but their impact were not similar. Specifically, UV-assisted oocyte enucleation was identified as the major source of ROS production, which explained significantly higher total ROS of reconstituted embryos in c-NT compared to m-HMC. Fusion efficiency (95.3±3.3 vs. 75.4±7.6%) and total efficiency of blastocyst development (22.5±3.0 vs. 14.1±4.3%) were significantly higher in m-HMC compared to c-NT, respectively, and blastocysts of transferable quality were obtained in similar rates (41.9±8.2 vs. 48.0±15.2%, respectively). Significance differences were observed in total cell number (155.3±13.6 vs. 123.6±19.5) and trophectoderm (145±9.5 vs. 114.3±15.2), but not inner cell mass (10.3±4.1 vs. 9.3±5.3) counts between blastocysts developed in c-NT compared to m-HMC, respectively. However, expression of key developmental genes (POU5F1, KLF4, SOX2, MYC, and CDX2) was comparable between blastocysts of both groups. The introduced m-HMC method might be a viable approach for efficient production of dromedary camel clones for research and commercial utilization."

OX40 (CD134) is a tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-receptor family member expressed primarily on activated CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells. In an autoimmune disease, OX40 is typically up-regulated at sites of inflammation, and increases in the number of peripheral CD4+ T-cells expressing OX40. OX40 and its ligand OX40L are key TNF members that augment T-cell expansion, cytokine production, and promote T-cell survival. The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare of OX40 gene expression and its serum levels in patients with NMO and healthy controls. Twenty sex-/age-matched healthy controls (HC) (median age = 32 years, 15 females/5 males) were engaged for the present study. Expression of OX40 at the transcript level and serum protein levels were measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, respectively. The results indicated OX40 expression in patients was significantly lower than in healthy controls (p = 0.001). However, the serum level of OX40 was not significantly different between groups (p = 0.37). In addition, the results indicated that CD134 expression was not age-related (p = 0.041). Overall, this study suggests to us that OX40 levels are not a suitable marker for diagnosis or treatment of NMO.",Vimentin is required for normal accumulation of body fat.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995202,Biological chemistry,2019 05 20,"Intermediate filaments (nanofilaments) have many functions, especially in response to cellular stress. Mice lacking vimentin (Vim-/-) display phenotypes reflecting reduced levels of cell activation and ability to counteract stress, for example, decreased reactivity of astrocytes after neurotrauma, decreased migration of astrocytes and fibroblasts, attenuated inflammation and fibrosis in lung injury, delayed wound healing, impaired vascular adaptation to nephrectomy, impaired transendothelial migration of lymphocytes and attenuated atherosclerosis. To address the role of vimentin in fat accumulation, we assessed the body weight and fat by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) in Vim-/- and matched wildtype (WT) mice. While the weight of 1.5-month-old Vim-/- and WT mice was comparable, Vim-/- mice showed decreased body weight at 3.5, 5.5 and 8.5 months (males by 19-22%, females by 18-29%). At 8.5 months, Vim-/- males and females had less body fat compared to WT mice (a decrease by 24%, p < 0.05, and 33%, p < 0.0001, respectively). The body mass index in 8.5 months old Vim-/- mice was lower in males (6.8 vs. 7.8, p < 0.005) and females (6.0 vs. 7.7, p < 0.0001) despite the slightly lower body length of Vim-/- mice. Increased mortality was observed in adult Vim-/- males.

Despite its importance in creating resilient barriers, the mechanisms that ensure stable continuity and preserve morphological and molecular symmetry upon fusion remain unclear. Using the segmented embryonic epidermis whose flanks fuse during Drosophila dorsal closure, we demonstrate that epidermal flanks modulate cell numbers and geometry of their fusing fronts to achieve fusion fidelity. While fusing flanks become more matched for both parameters before fusion, differences persisting at fusion are corrected by modulating fusing front width within each segment to ensure alignment of segment boundaries. We show that fusing cell interfaces are remodelled from en-face contacts at fusion to an interlocking arrangement after fusion, and demonstrate that changes in interface length and geometry are dependent on the spatiotemporal regulation of cytoskeletal tension and Bazooka/Par3.

Background and Study Design:
 This study was undertaken as part of the UK LIMPRINT international study to determine the number of people with chronic edema (CO) and its impact on health services. Overall 7436 with CO were recruited in the main UK study from a range of health settings. 
Methods and Results:
 Factors relating to subjective control of arm and leg CO were defined in the UK. A total of 1565 patients were included in the study with exclusions for: no limb swelling or not recorded (1669), having concurrent arm/leg CO (272), control of assessment missing (5) and professional being unsure of control status of CO (325). Arm swelling occurred in 953 (18.5%) with leg CO in 4212 (81.5%). Poor control was found in 1430 (27.2%) and good control in 3735 (72.3%). Control of arm swelling was worse in men and control increased overall in those aged over 45 years. In contrast control of CO worsened in those with leg CO with increasing age and multiple co-morbidities. Obesity and cellulitis, particularly an episode in the last year were associated with poor control. Independent risk factors for arm CO were : obesity, neurological disease and cellulitis in the last year and for leg CO, obesity, poor mobility, heart disease, presence of a wound, cellulitis in the last year and duration of swelling. 
Conclusion:
 Control of CO within specialized centers is complex due to sociodemographic and clinical comorbidities.","LIMPRINT in Specialist Lymphedema Services in United Kingdom, France, Italy, and Turkey.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995195,Lymphatic research and biology,2019 04 17,"
Background:
 There is no standardized international model for specialist lymphedema services, which covers the types of lymphedema treated and the treatments provided. The aim of this study was to provide a profile of patients attending specialist lymphedema services in different countries to explore similarities and differences. 
Methods and Results:
 The LIMPRINT core tool was used in specialist lymphedema services in the United Kingdom, France, Italy, and Turkey. Services in Turkey saw a slightly younger age group, with a higher proportion of female patients reflecting a particular focus on breast cancer-related lymphedema. There were higher levels of obesity and restricted mobility in patients in the United Kingdom compared with other countries. Italy and France saw the highest percentage of patients with primary lymphedema. Diabetes was a common comorbidity in the United Kingdom and Turkey. The United Kingdom saw the largest number of patients with lower limb lymphedema. 
Conclusions:
 The results show a wide range of complexity of patients treated in specialist lymphedema services. Some of the differences between countries may reflect different stages in the evolution of specialist lymphedema services, rather than a true difference in prevalence, with those with ""younger"" services treating a high proportion of patients with cancer and those with more established services treating a wider range of different types of lymphedema, including more elderly people with multiple comorbidities.",The Prevalence and Functional Impact of Chronic Edema and Lymphedema in Japan: LIMPRINT Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995194,Lymphatic research and biology,2019 04 17,"
Background:
 This was a part of LIMPRINT (Lymphoedema IMpact and PRevalence-INTernational), an international study aimed at capturing the size and impact of lymphedema and chronic edema in different countries and health services across the world. The purpose of this study was to clarify the prevalence and the impact of chronic edema in Japan. 
Methods and Results:
 This was a two-phase facility-based study to determine the prevalence and functional impact of chronic edema in the adult population in Japan between 2014 and 2015. The prevalence study involved a university hospital, an acute community hospital, and a long-term medical facility. The impact study involved six facilities, including two outpatient clinics in acute care hospitals (one led by a physician and the other led by a nurse), inpatient wards in two acute care hospitals, and two nursing home/long-term care facilities. Various questionnaires and clinical assessments were used to gather patient demographic data and assess the functional impact of chronic edema. The results showed that chronic edema was much more prevalent in the long-term care facility than in acute care hospitals; cellulitis episodes occurred in ∼50% of cases in the gynecologist-led outpatient clinic, even though >80.0% of patients received standard management for edema; edema was found in the trunk region, including the buttock, abdomen, and chest-breast areas, in addition to the upper and lower limbs; and subjective satisfaction with edema control was low, even though the quality-of-life scores were good. 
Conclusions:
 The prevalence of chronic edema varied according to the facility type, ranging from 5.0% to 66.1%. The edema was located in all body parts, including the trunk region. Subjective satisfaction with control of edema was poor, while general quality of life was good. This large health care issue needs more attention.","LIMPRINT: Prevalence of Chronic Edema in Health Services in Copenhagen, Denmark.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995193,Lymphatic research and biology,2019 04 17,"
Background:
 The International Lymphedema Framework developed an international study, Lymphedema Impact and Prevalence International (LIMPRINT), to estimate the prevalence and impact of chronic edema (CO) in heterogeneous populations. 
Methods and Results:
 A validation study using the LIMPRINT methodology was undertaken in Denmark. Participants with CO were identified from inpatient services and compared with those identified within a specialist lymphedema service and three primary care settings. Of 452 inpatients available for screening, CO was present in 177 (39%) and absent in 275 (61%). In addition, 723 participants were found from specialist and primary care services (LPCSs). Inpatients were significantly older and more likely to be underweight or normal weight. They were more likely to suffer from heart failure/ischaemic heart disease (44.6% vs. 23.4%, p < 0.001) and have neurological problems (18.1% vs. 10.9% p = 0.009). Patients in the inpatient group were nearly all suffering from secondary lymphedema and were less likely to have a cancer or venous diagnosis, but more likely to have immobility as the cause of CO (44.0% vs. 17.7%, p < 0.001). No inpatients had midline CO compared with 30 within LPCSs. Fewer in the inpatient group had standard CO treatment (17.1% vs. 73.5%, p < 0.001) and subjective control of swelling was worse (19.9% vs. 66.7%, p < 0.001). While the inpatient group experienced fewer acute infections, when they did so, they were more likely to be admitted to hospital for this (78.6% vs. 51.0%, p = 0.049). 
Conclusion:
 The prevalence of CO in inpatient facilities is high and those with CO have multiple comorbidities that vary according to setting. The feasibility study showed that the methodology could be adapted for use in different health systems.",LIMPRINT Study: The Turkish Experience.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995192,Lymphatic research and biology,2019 04 17,"
Background:
 Lymphedema and chronic edema is a major health care problem in both developed and nondeveloped countries The Lymphoedema Impact and Prevelance - International (LIMPRINT) study is an international health service-based study to determine the prevalence and functional impact in adult populations of member countries of the International Lymphoedema Framework (ILF). 
Methods and Results:
 A total of 1051 patients from eight centers in Turkey were recruited using the LIMPRINT study protocol. Data were collected using the core and module tools that assess the demographic and clinical properties as well as disability and quality of life (QoL). Most of the Turkish patients were recruited from specialist lymphedema services and were found to be women, housewives, and having secondary lymphedema because of cancer treatment. The duration of lymphedema was commonly <5 years and most of them had International Society of Lymphology (ISL) grade 2 lymphedema. Cellulitis, infection, and wounds were uncommon. The majority of patients did not get any treatment or advice before. Most of the patients had impaired QoL and decreased functionality, but psychological support was neglected. Although most had social health security access to lymphedema centers, nevertheless access seemed difficult because of distance and cost. 
Conclusion:
 The study has shown the current status and characteristics of lymphedema patients, treatment conditions, the unmet need for the diagnosis and treatment, as well as burden of the disease in both patients and families in Turkey. National health policies are needed for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment in Turkey that utilize this informative data.",LIMPRINT: Estimation of the Prevalence of Lymphoedema/Chronic Oedema in Acute Hospital in In-Patients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995191,Lymphatic research and biology,2019 04 17,"
Background:
 To estimate the prevalence of lymphedema/chronic edema (CO) and wounds in acute hospital inpatients in five different countries. 
Methods and Results:
 A point-prevalence study was carried out during working day periods in six general hospitals in four countries (Denmark, France, United Kingdom, and Australia) and one hospital oncology inpatient unit in one other country (Ireland). The study used validated clinical tools for the assessment and collection of data. Data were collected by expert clinicians through interviews and physical examination of the patients present in the wards. A total of 1905 patients could be included and investigated among the 3041 total bed occupancy in the seven hospitals. Lymphedema/CO was present in 723 of them (38%). Main risk factors associated with CO were age, morbid obesity, and heart failure, as well as chair bound immobility and neurological deficiency. History of cellulitis was frequent in patients with CO and wounds (24.8%) and CO alone (14.1%) compared to the 1.5% prevalence in patients without CO. 
Conclusion:
 Lymphedema/CO is very frequent in patients hospitalized in hospital acute wards. It is strongly associated with obesity, venous insufficiency, and heart failure. Our results strongly suggest a hidden health care burden and cost linked to CO independently of chronic wounds."

A central requirement for the development of any chronic disease is the clear use of public health definitions that can be used internationally to define populations. The term ""lymphedema"" has historically been defined as either primary, resulting from failure of lymphatic development, or secondary, following damage to the lymphatics (e.g., cancer treatment, injury, or filariasis). Attempts to integrate causes of edema arising from damage to the venous system or the effects of gravity, immobility, and systemic disease have rarely been integrated. More recently, the prominent role of the lymphatics in tissue fluid homeostasis in all forms of chronic edema has been recognized. These advances led to the development of the term: ""Chronic edema: a broad term used to describe edema, which has been present for more than three months."" It can be considered an umbrella term that includes not only conventional ""lymphedema"" but also chronic swelling, which may have a more complex cause. This definition has been adapted in the international epidemiology study (LIMPRINT) that identified people throughout the health and social care systems in participating countries. Clearer definitions will allow for examination of this important public health problem that is likely to escalate given the projections of an aging population with multiple comorbidities. It will be possible to define both the hidden mortality and morbidity associated with complications, such as cellulitis and the impact on health-related quality of life.

However, whether the ER becomes more tubular or more cisternal during mitosis is controversial, and dedicated factors governing the morphology of the mitotic ER have remained elusive. Here, we describe the ER membrane proteins REEP3 and REEP4 as major determinants of ER morphology in metaphase cells. REEP3/4 are specifically required for generating the high-curvature morphology of mitotic ER and promote ER tubulation through their reticulon homology domains (RHDs). This ER-shaping activity of REEP3/4 is distinct from their previously described function to clear ER from metaphase chromatin. We further show that related REEP proteins do not contribute to mitotic ER shaping and provide evidence that the REEP3/4 carboxyterminus mediates regulation of the proteins. These findings confirm that ER converts to higher curvature during mitosis, identify REEP3/4 as specific and crucial morphogenic factors mediating ER tubulation during mitosis, and define the first cell cycle-specific role for RHD proteins.","Final Results of a Randomized, Phase III Study of Rituximab With or Without Idelalisib Followed by Open-Label Idelalisib in Patients With Relapsed Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995176,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,2019 05 29,"A randomized, double-blind, phase III study of idelalisib (IDELA) plus rituximab versus placebo plus rituximab in patients with relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) was terminated early because of superior efficacy of the IDELA-plus-rituximab (IDELA/R) arm.

This study is the 1st to examine DLD in Vietnamese. To lay the foundation, we identified cases of DLD in Vietnam and explored language-specific characteristics of the disorder. Method Teacher ratings of 1,250 kindergarteners living in Hanoi, Vietnam, were used to recruit children with and without risk for DLD. One hundred four children completed direct measures of vocabulary and language sampling, and their parents completed in-depth surveys. We examined convergence and divergence across tasks to identify measures that could serve as reliable indicators of risk. Then, we compared performance on direct language measures across ability levels. Results There were positive associations between teacher and parent report and between report and direct language measures. Three groups were identified based on convergence across measures: DLD, some risk for DLD, and no risk. The DLD group performed lowest on measures of receptive and expressive vocabulary, mean length of utterance, and grammaticality. Although children with DLD exhibited a greater number of errors, the types of errors found were similar across DLD and No Risk groups. Conclusions Similar to rates found globally, 7% of the kindergarten population in Vietnam exhibited risk for DLD.

Psychometric functions of vowel detection and identification for 12 American English isolated vowels in long-term speech-shaped noise were examined for young listeners with normal hearing in this study. Method Vowel detection was measured at sensation levels from -10 to +5 dB (re: thresholds of vowel detection from the study of Liu and Eddins, 2008a ) with a 4-interval forced-choice procedure. Thresholds of vowel detection were computed for each listener as the speech level at which 70.7% correct performance was reached. Vowel identification was then examined at sensation levels from 0 to 12 dB relative to detection thresholds for each listener. Thresholds of vowel identification were calculated as the speech level with vowel identifiability ( d') equals to 1. Results Thresholds of vowel detection and identification were significantly affected by vowel category. Slopes of psychometric functions of vowel identification were significantly dependent on vowel category, whereas slopes of psychometric functions of vowel detection were not. Conclusions These results suggest that, given the same sensation levels, especially at low sensation levels, vowel sounds are not equally perceivable in terms of identifiability.",Nonmuscle myosin IIA and IIB differentially modulate migration and alter gene expression in primary mouse tumorigenic cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995168,Molecular biology of the cell,2019 05 30,"Though many cancers are known to show up-regulation of nonmuscle myosin (NM) IIA and IIB, the mechanism by which NMIIs aid in cancer development remains unexplored. Here we demonstrate that tumor-generating, fibroblast-like cells isolated from 3-methylcholanthrene (3MC)-induced murine tumor exhibit distinct phospho-dependent localization of NMIIA and NMIIB at the perinuclear area and tip of the filopodia and affect cell migration differentially. While NMIIA-KD affects protrusion dynamics and increases cell directionality, NMIIB-KD lowers migration speed and increases filopodial branching. Strategically located NMIIs at the perinuclear area colocalize with the linker of nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton (LINC) protein Nesprin2 and maintain the integrity of the nuclear-actin cap. Interestingly, knockdown of NMIIs results in altered expression of genes involved in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, angiogenesis, and cellular senescence. NMIIB-KD cells display down-regulation of Gsc and Serpinb2, which is strikingly similar to Nesprin2-KD cells as assessed by quantitative PCR analysis. Further gene network analysis predicts that NMIIA and NMIIB may act on similar pathways but through different regulators. Concomitantly, knockdown of NMIIA or NMIIB lowers the growth rate and tumor volume of 3MC-induced tumor in vivo. Altogether, these results open a new window to further investigate the effect of LINC-associated perinuclear actomyosin complex on mechanoresponsive gene expression in the growing tumor.",Evolution of surgical treatment of carotid artery stenosis: a single center observational study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995167,Acta chirurgica Belgica,2019 05 03,"In 2009 and 2011 respectively ESVS and AHA/ASA guidelines recommended to operate patients with a symptomatic carotid artery stenosis within 14 days.

We show that longer KASH domains can withstand and transfer higher forces and interact with the membrane through a conserved membrane proximal EEDY domain that is unique to longer KASH domains. In agreement with our models, our in vivo results show that swapping the KASH domains of ANC-1 and UNC-83, or shortening the KASH domain of ANC-1, both result in a nuclear anchorage defect in C. elegans.",Diagnostic Decisions in Child Language Assessment: Findings From a Case Review Assessment Task.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995154,"Language, speech, and hearing services in schools",2019 05 27,"Purpose The current study used a case review diagnostic assessment task to examine the diagnostic decisions speech-language pathologists (SLPs) working in the United States made after reviewing child language cases. Method Fourteen SLPs were given 5 case studies that presented either congruent or incongruent results between standardized testing and informal measures. After reviewing the assessment data, SLPs were asked to make a diagnostic decision. Results Unanimous consensus regarding diagnostic decisions was found when the assessment data were congruent. When the data were incongruent, unanimous consensus was not achieved. Standardized testing seemed to guide the diagnostic decision. This pattern of reliance on standardized testing was evident even when 80% of SLPs reviewed informal language data. In 97% of cases, a standardized test was used to guide clinical decision making. Conclusion Three patterns of clinical decision making in child language assessment emerged: (a) use of both standardized testing and informal measures, (b) a reported concern tool as a 1st step in the process, and (c) standardized testing as the most influential data for guiding diagnostic decisions. Although this study provides initial evidence regarding the process of diagnostic decision making, future studies should examine decision making in real time to further validate the implicit rules used during decision making.

Ideally, a vestibular implant system using this approach would be integrated with a cochlear implant, which would provide clinicians with a means to simultaneously treat loss of both vestibular and auditory sensation. Despite obvious similarities, merging these technologies poses several challenges, including stimulus pulse timing errors that arise when a system must implement a pulse frequency modulation-encoding scheme (as is used in vestibular implants to mimic normal vestibular nerve encoding of head movement) within fixed-rate continuous interleaved sampling (CIS) strategies used in cochlear implants. Pulse timing errors caused by temporal discretization inherent to CIS create stair step discontinuities of the vestibular implant's smooth mapping of head velocity to stimulus pulse frequency. In this study, we assayed electrically evoked vestibuloocular reflex responses in two rhesus macaques using both a smooth pulse frequency modulation map and a discretized map corrupted by temporal errors typical of those arising in a combined cochlear-vestibular implant. Responses were measured using three-dimensional scleral coil oculography for prosthetic electrical stimuli representing sinusoidal head velocity waveforms that varied over 50-400°/s and 0.1-5 Hz. Pulse timing errors produced negligible effects on responses across all canals in both animals, indicating that temporal discretization inherent to implementing a pulse frequency modulation-coding scheme within a cochlear implant's CIS fixed pulse timing framework need not sacrifice performance of the combined system's vestibular implant portion. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Merging a vestibular implant system with existing cochlear implant technology can provide clinicians with a means to restore both vestibular and auditory sensation. Pulse timing errors inherent to integration of pulse frequency modulation vestibular stimulation with fixed-rate, continuous interleaved sampling cochlear implant stimulation would discretize the smooth head velocity encoding of a combined device. In this study, we show these pulse timing errors produce negligible effects on electrically evoked vestibulo-ocular reflex responses in two rhesus macaques.","Phylogeny, Distribution, and Pathogenicity of Lasiodiplodia Species Associated With Cankers and Dieback Symptoms of Persian Lime in Mexico.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995151,Plant disease,2019 06 06,"Persian lime (Citrus latifolia Tan.) is an important and widely cultivated fruit crop in several regions of Mexico. In recent years, severe symptoms of gummosis, stem cankers, and dieback were detected in the Persian lime-producing region in the states of Veracruz and Puebla, Mexico. The aims of this study were to identify the species of Lasiodiplodia associated with these symptoms, determine the distribution of these species, and test their pathogenicity and virulence on Persian lime plants. In 2015, symptomatic samples were collected from 12 commercial Persian lime orchards, and 60 Lasiodiplodia isolates were obtained. Fungal identification of 32 representative isolates was performed using a phylogenetic analysis based on DNA sequence data of the internal transcribed spacer region and part of the translation elongation factor 1-α and β-tubulin genes. Sequence analyses were carried out using the Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian Inference methods. Six Lasiodiplodia species were identified as Lasiodiplodia pseudotheobromae, Lasiodiplodia theobromae, Lasiodiplodia brasiliense, Lasiodiplodia subglobosa, Lasiodiplodia citricola, and Lasiodiplodia iraniensis. All Lasiodiplodia species of this study are reported for the first time in association with Persian lime in Mexico and worldwide. L. pseudotheobromae (46.9% of isolates) was the most frequently isolated species followed by L. theobromae (28.1%) and L. brasiliense (12.5%). Pathogenicity on Persian lime young plants using a mycelial plug inoculation method showed that all identified Lasiodiplodia species were able to cause necrotic lesions and gummosis, but L. subglobosa, L. iraniensis, and L. pseudotheobromae were the most virulent.",Improved Evaluation of Wheat Cultivars (Lines) on Resistance to Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici Using Molecular Disease Index.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995150,Plant disease,2019 06 06,"Wheat stripe rust caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici is one of the most destructive diseases of wheat worldwide. Sichuan Province plays an important role in interregional epidemics in China. Application of host resistance is important in disease management, and efficient approaches to evaluate resistance level are necessary to obtain useful varieties. In this study, 100 wheat cultivars (lines) growing in Sichuan were selected to evaluate their resistance to stripe rust. Field experiments were conducted with a mixture of three P. striiformis f. sp. tritici races for inoculations at seeding and adult stages in the 2014 to 2015 season and the 2016 to 2017 season. Leaf samplings were conducted four times during the latent period at early growth stage of wheat. The sampled leaves were processed to extract DNA. The DNA of both wheat and P. striiformis f. sp. tritici was quantified using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and the molecular disease index (MDI) was used to evaluate the resistance level. The area under the disease progress curve in terms of disease index (AUDPC-DI) was obtained for each studied cultivar (line) in the fields. Among the 100 studied cultivars (lines), 61% of them showed seedling resistance, and 63 and 65% showed adult resistance in the 2014 to 2015 and 2016 to 2017 seasons, respectively, based on the infection type. High consistency in resistance grouping by cluster analysis as the percentage of the studied cultivar (line) belonging to the same group based on AUDPC-DI data and based on MDI data was obtained. The correlations between AUDPC-DI and MDI from samples collected on 9 and 14 or 15 days after inoculation during the latent period were all significant at P < 0.01.

Higher prevalence and levels of Salmonella were previously observed in floater pistachios, but contributing factors are unclear. To examine the behavior of pathogens on hulled pistachios during simulated drying delays, floater and sinker pistachios collected from commercial processors were inoculated at 1 or 3 log CFU/g with cocktails of Salmonella and in some cases Escherichia coli O157:H7 or Listeria monocytogenes and incubated for up to 30 h at 37°C and 90% relative humidity. Populations were measured by plating onto tryptic soy agar and appropriate selective agars. In most cases, no significant growth (P > 0.05) of Salmonella was observed in the first 3 h after inoculation in hulled floaters and sinkers. Growth of Salmonella was greater on floater pistachios than on corresponding sinkers and on floater pistachios with ≥25% hull adhering to the shell surface than on corresponding floaters with <25% adhering hull. Maximum Salmonella populations (2 to 7 log CFU/g) were ∼2-log higher on floaters than on corresponding sinkers. The growth of E. coli O157:H7 and Salmonella on hulled pistachios was similar, but a longer lag time (approximately 11 h) and significantly lower maximum populations (4 versus 5 to 6 log CFU/g; P < 0.05) were predicted for L. monocytogenes. Significant growth of pathogens on hulled pistachios is possible when delays between hulling and drying are longer than 3 h, and pathogen growth is enhanced in the presence of adhering hull material.",Chronic tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) use in metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC): can this lead to the adverse effect of hypogonadism?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995130,Expert review of anticancer therapy,2019 06 04,"Background: Patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) are commonly treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). An adverse effect frequently suffered by patients is lethargy, which often leads to dose reduction or drug cessation. We aimed to assess whether hypogonadism is related to treatment with TKIs. Methods: We prospectively assessed gonadal function in 41 consecutive males with mRCC treated with TKIs. Demographic, clinical, and biochemical variables were collected, and statistical analyses performed to assess correlation and survival. Data Capture for each patient was perfomred at the time of entry in the study. Results: There was a 77% incidence of hypogonadism in this cohort. Assessment of testosterone level and time on TKI treatment revealed a correlation with linear regression R2 of 0.24 and regression coefficient of -0.003 (p = 0.019). Odds ratio for hypogonadism at >30 months on TKIs was 12.1 (p = 0.011). Odds ratios above and below this value showed a confirmatory trend, suggesting that this may be a chronic adverse effect. Conclusions: Our findings provide an important and robust hypothesis for a prospective clinical trial to be performed.

We aimed to assess the prevalence of this unusual facial injury among motorcyclists who sustained facial injuries in selected hospitals and to determine the possible mechanism involved. Methods: We used our prospective cross-sectional substudy involving injured motorcyclists presenting at major trauma hospitals in Southern Klang Valley, Malaysia, between March 2010 and March 2011. of 391 subjects with facial injuries, 2 male motorcyclists sustained this laceration. The wounds were assessed and we believed that each was associated with the helmet visor. One of the visors was collected and the edge was inspected using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Results: The prevalence of this unusual injury was 0.51% (95% confidence interval, 0.002-0.012) among motorcyclists who sustained facial injuries. Both cases were involved in a head-on collision with their colliding partners and their helmets were intact throughout the crash. The visor in case 1 was intact, but the visor in case 2 was broken. SEM analysis showed that the visor in case 1 had a potential cutting surface. We postulated that with helmet rotation in the forward and downward position and with some degree of visor bending or with a dislodged visor, the sharp-edged visor could potentially severely lacerate the face. Conclusion: This injury affects facial aesthetics and early referral to the facial surgery team is advocated.

Methods: Immunohistochemical expressions of hypoxia markers were determined semi-quantitatively in tumour tissue microarray of 46 patients with embryonal RMS (RME) and 20 with alveolar (RMA), treated with CWS protocols (1992-2013). Results: In paediatric RME, response to naCHT was influenced significantly by tumour expression of CA IX and GLUT-1. Patients with RMA with low expressions of analysed markers responded well to naCHT, while all poor-responders expressed highly hypoxia markers. Only 5.88% of RMA and 11.11% of RME tumours did not express any of the proteins. In both RME and RMA subgroups, most poor-responders demonstrated simultaneous high expression of ≥3 markers, while most patients expressing ≤2 markers responded well to naCHT. In the whole cohort, co-expression of ≥3 markers, was the only independent factor predicting poor-response to chemotherapy (odds ratio 14.706; 95% CI 1.72-125.75; p = 0.014).

Renal physiology,2019 05 29,"Renal Na+-glucose cotransporter SGLT1 mediates glucose reabsorption in the late proximal tubule, a hypoxia-sensitive tubular segment that enters the outer medulla. Gene deletion in mice (Sglt1-/-) was used to determine the role of the cotransporter in acute kidney injury induced by ischemia-reperfusion (IR), including the initial injury and subsequent recovery phase. On days 1 and 16 after IR, absolute and fractional urinary glucose excretion remained greater in Sglt1-/- mice versus wild-type (WT) littermates, consistent with a sustained contribution of SGLT1 to tubular glucose reabsorption in WT mice. Absence of SGLT1 did not affect the initial kidney impairment versus WT mice, as indicated by similar increases on day 1 in plasma concentrations of creatinine and urinary excretion of the tubular injury marker kidney injury molecule-1 as well as a similar rise in plasma osmolality and fall in urine osmolality as indicators of impaired urine concentration. Recovery of kidney function on days 14/16, however, was improved in Sglt1-/- versus WT mice, as indicated by lower plasma creatinine, higher glomerula filtration rate (by FITC-sinistrin in awake mice), and more completely restored urine and plasma osmolality. This was associated with a reduced tubular injury score in the cortex and outer medulla, better preserved renal mRNA expression of tubular transporters (Sglt2 and Na+-K+-2Cl- cotransporter Nkcc2), and a lesser rise in renal mRNA expression of markers of injury, inflammation, and fibrosis [kidney injury molecule-1, chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2, fibronectin 1, and collagen type I-α1] in Sglt1-/- versus WT mice. These results suggest that SGLT1 activity in the late proximal tubule may have deleterious effects during recovery of IR-induced acute kidney injury and identify SGLT1 as a potential therapeutic target.",Adenosine kinase inhibition protects against cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995110,American journal of physiology. Renal physiology,2019 04 17,"Numerous studies have demonstrated that several mechanisms, including oxidative stress, DNA damage and inflammatory responses, are closely linked to cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity. Adenosine, emerging as a key regulatory molecule, is mostly protective in the pathophysiology of inflammatory diseases. Previous study showed that some of the adenosine receptors led to renal protection against ischemia-reperfusion injury. However, these adenosine receptors agonists lack a useful therapeutic index due to cardiovascular side effects. We hypothesized that inhibition of adenosine kinase might exacerbate extracellular adenosine levels to reduce cisplatin-induced renal injury. In this study, pretreatment of adenosine kinase inhibitor ABT-702 could markedly attenuate cisplatin-induced acute kidney injury, tubular cell apoptosis, oxidative stress and inflammation in the kidneys. Consistent to in vivo results, the inhibition of ADK suppressed cisplatin-induced apoptosis, ROS production and inflammation in HK2 cells. Additionally, the protective effect of ADK inhibition was abolished by A1 or A2B adenosine receptor antagonist and enhanced by A2A or A3 adenosine receptor antagonist. Collectively, the results suggest that inhibition of ADK might increase the extracellular adenosine levels, which inhibited cisplatin-induced oxidative stress and inflammation via A1 and A2B adenosine receptors, finally suppressing cisplatin-induced cell apoptosis. Pharmacological therapies based on adenosine kinase will be of potential use for the therapy of cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity.",Electrical stimulation facilitates the angiogenesis of human umbilical vein endothelial cells through MAPK/ERK signaling pathway by stimulating FGF2 secretion.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995109,American journal of physiology. Cell physiology,2019 04 17,"Electrical stimulation (ES) is able to enhance angiogenesis by stimulating fibroblasts. Fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) is an independent angiogenesis inducer. The current study aimed to evaluate the role of ES-induced FGF2 secretion in affecting angiogenesis during wound healing via the mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MAPK/ERK) signaling pathway. Fibroblasts and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were exposed to ES, and the HUVECs were co-cultured with ES-treated fibroblast culture solution. ES exposure showed no toxic effects on fibroblasts and HUVECs. ES led to enhanced growth of fibroblasts and HUVECs, as well as FGF2 secretion which is induced through the NOS pathway. ES-induced FGF2 secretion were shown to increase vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) protein, and enhance migration, invasion and angiogenesis of HUVECs. Also, ES-induced FGF2 secretion activated the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway. However, inhibition of the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway reversed the positive effects of ES-induced FGF2 secretion. In-vitro experiments showed positive effects of ES on wound healing. Taken together, the findings suggested that ES promoted FGF2 secretion and then activated MAPK/ERK signaling pathway, by which facilitating angiogenesis and promoting wound healing.",Differential YAP nuclear signaling in healthy and dystrophic skeletal muscle.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995108,American journal of physiology. Cell physiology,2019 04 17,"Mechanical forces regulate muscle development, hypertrophy, and homeostasis. Force-transmitting structures allow mechanotransduction at the sarcolemma, cytoskeleton, and nuclear envelope. There is growing evidence that YAP (Yes-associated protein) serves as a nuclear relay of mechanical signals and can induce a range of downstream signaling cascades. Dystrophin is a sarcolemma-associated protein and its absence underlies the pathology in Duchenne muscular dystrophy. We tested the hypothesis that absence of dystrophin in muscle would result in reduced YAP signaling in response to loading. Following in-vivo contractile loading in muscles of healthy (wild type, WT) mice and mice lacking dystrophin (mdx), we performed western blots of whole and fractionated muscle homogenates to examine the ratio of phospho (cytoplasmic) YAP to total YAP and nuclear YAP, respectively. We show that in-vivo contractile loading induced a robust increase in YAP expression and its nuclear localization in WT muscles. Surprisingly, in mdx muscles, active YAP expression was constitutively elevated and unresponsive to load. Results from qRT-PCR analysis support the hyperactivation of YAP in-vivo in mdx muscles, as evidenced by increased gene expression of YAP downstream targets. In-vitro assays of isolated myofibers plated on substrates with high stiffness showed YAP nuclear labeling for both genotypes, indicating functional YAP signaling in mdx muscles. We conclude that while YAP signaling can occur in the absence of dystrophin, dystrophic muscles have altered mechanotransduction, whereby constitutively active YAP results in a failure to respond to load, which could be attributed to the increased state of ""pre-stress"" with increased cytoskeletal and extracellular-matrix stiffness.",Methylglyoxal Triggers Human Aortic Endothelial Cell Dysfunction via Modulating KATP/MAPK pathway.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995106,American journal of physiology.

Methylglyoxal (MGO), a highly reactive dicarbonyl mainly generated as a by-product of glycolysis, is increased in both type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients.

However, exactly how MGO causes endothelial cell dysfunction is not clear. Human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs) from healthy (H-HAECs) and type 2 diabetic (D-HAECs) donors were cultured in endothelial growth media (EGM-2). D-HAECs demonstrated impaired tube formation (on Matrigel) and proliferation (MTT assay), as well as increased apoptosis (TUNEL staining), compared with H-HAECs. H-HAECs were treated with MGO (10µM) for 24 hours with or without ATP-sensitive potassium channel (KATP) channel antagonist glibenclamide (1µM). MGO significantly impaired H-HAECs tube formation and proliferation and induced cell apoptosis which was reversed by glibenclamide. Meanwhile, activation of MAPK pathways p38 kinase, JNK, and ERK (determined by Western blot analyses of their phosphorylated forms, p-JNK, p-p38 and p-ERK) in D-HAECs were significantly enhanced compared with those in H-HAECs. MGO exposure enhanced the activation of all three MAPK pathways in H-HAECs, while glibenclamide reversed the activation of P-SAPK/JNK induced by MGO. Our data suggests MGO triggers endothelial cell dysfunction by activating JNK/P38 MAPK pathway, partly through activation of KATP channel. Our study may provide useful information for developing MGO-targeted interventions to treat vascular disorders in diabetes.",mTORC1 is required for expression of LRPPRC and cytochrome c oxidase but not HIF-1α in Leigh Syndrome French Canadian Type Patient Fibroblasts.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995105,American journal of physiology. Cell physiology,2019 04 17,"Leigh syndrome French Canadian type (LSFC) is a mitochondrial disease caused by mutations in the LRPRRC gene leading to a reduction of cytochrome c oxidase (COX) expression reaching 50% in skin fibroblasts. We have shown that, under basal conditions, LSFC and control cells display similar ATP levels. We hypothesized that this occurs through upregulation of mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR)-mediated metabolic reprogramming. Our results showed that, compared to controls, LSFC cells exhibited an upregulationof the mTORC1/p70S6K pathway, and higher levels of the hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1α and its downstream target, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDHK1), a regulator of mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase 1 (PDH1). Consistent with these signaling alterations, LSFC cells displayed a 40-61% increase in [U-13C6]glucose contribution to pyruvate, lactate and alanine formation, as well as higher levels of the phosphorylated and inactive form of PDH1-α. Interestingly, inhibition of mTOR with rapamycin did not alter HIF-1α or PDHK1 protein levels in LSFC fibroblasts. However, this treatment increased PDH1-α phosphorylation in control and LSFC cells and reduced ATP levels in control cells. Rapamycin also decreased LRPPRC expression by 41% and 11% in LSFC and control cells, respectively, and selectively reduced COXIV expression in LSFC fibroblasts. Taken together, our data demonstrate the importance of mTORC1, independently of the HIF-1α/PDHK1 axis, in maintaining LRPPRC and COX expression in LSFC cells.",Changes in the power-duration relationship following prolonged exercise: estimation using conventional and all-out protocols and relationship to muscle glycogen.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995104,"American journal of physiology. Regulatory, integrative and comparative physiology",2019 04 17,"It is not clear how the parameters of the power-duration relationship (critical power (CP) and W') are influenced by the performance of prolonged endurance exercise. We used severe-intensity prediction trials (conventional protocol) and the 3-min all-out test (3MT) to measure CP and W' following 2 h of heavy-intensity cycling exercise and took muscle biopsies to investigate possible relationships with changes in muscle glycogen concentration ([glycogen]). Fourteen participants completed a rested 3MT to establish end-test power (Control-EP) and work done above EP (Control-WEP). Subsequently, on separate days, immediately following 2 h of heavy-intensity exercise, participants completed a 3MT to establish Fatigued-EP and Fatigued-WEP and three severe-intensity prediction trials to the limit of tolerance (Tlim) to establish Fatigued-CP and Fatigued-W'. A muscle biopsy was collected immediately before and after one of the 2-h exercise bouts. Fatigued-CP (256 ± 41 W) and Fatigued-EP (256 ± 52 W), and Fatigued-W' (15.3 ± 5.0 kJ) and Fatigued-WEP (14.6 ± 5.3 kJ), were not different (P>0.05), but were ~11% and ~20% lower than Control-EP (287 ± 46 W) and Control-WEP (18.7 ± 4.7 kJ), respectively (P<0.05). The change in muscle [glycogen] was not significantly correlated with the changes in either EP (r = 0.19) or WEP (r = 0.07). The power-duration relationship is adversely impacted by prolonged endurance exercise. The 3MT provides valid estimates of CP and W' following 2 h of heavy-intensity exercise but the changes in these parameters are not primarily determined by changes in muscle [glycogen].",Transcriptomic responses to Ivacaftor and prediction of Ivacaftor clinical responsiveness.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995102,American journal of respiratory cell and molecular biology,2019 04 17,"Ivacaftor is a recently FDA-approved drug for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients with at least one copy of the G511D mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. The transcriptomic effect of Ivacaftor in CF patients remains unclear. We aim to examine if and how the transcriptome of patients is influenced by Ivacaftor treatment and to determine if these data allow prediction of Ivacaftor responsiveness. Our data originate from the GOAL-G551D Observational Study. We performed RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) on PBMCs from 56 patients and compared the transcriptomic changes before and after Ivacaftor treatments. Consensus clustering method was employed to stratify patients into sub-groups based on clinical responses post treatment and we determined differences between subgroups in baseline gene expressions. A random forest model was built to predict Ivacaftor responsiveness. We identified 239 genes (false discovery rate < 0.1) that were significantly influenced by Ivacaftor in PBMC. The functions of these genes relate to cell differentiation, microbial infection, inflammation, Toll-like receptor signaling, and metabolism. We classified patients into ""good"" and ""moderate"" responders based on clinical response to Ivacraftor. We identified a panel of signature genes and built a statistical model for predicting CFTR modulator responsiveness. Despite a limited sample size, adequate prediction performance was achieved with an accuracy of 0.92. In conclusion, for the first time, the present study demonstrates profound transcriptomic impacts of Ivafactor in CF patients PBMCs and built a pilot statistical model for predicting the clinical responsiveness to Ivacaftor prior to treatment.",Asymmetric Ductal Ectasia: An Often Overlooked Sign of Malignancy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995101,AJR. American journal of roentgenology,2019 04 17,OBJECTIVE. The objective of this article is to define the clinical significance of asymmetric ductal ectasia by a review of literature and to describe the imaging findings. CONCLUSION. Asymmetric ductal ectasia has a significant risk for malignancy and high-risk lesions. The findings on conventional imaging may be subtle and easily overlooked. Asymmetric ductal ectasia should be included in the search pattern during image interpretation. Tissue sampling is usually warranted. Ultrasound is critical in identifying ductal abnormalities to guide biopsy.,Detection and Characterization of Atypical Renal Cysts and Solid Renal Masses in Kidney Transplant Patients by Use of Dual-Energy CT Iodine Maps.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995100,AJR. American journal of roentgenology,2019 04 17,"OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether dual-energy CT follow-up of kidney transplant recipients performed with only two contrast-enhanced phases and reconstructed material maps has the same diagnostic efficiency as triphasic conventional CT in detection and characterization of atypical renal cysts and renal masses. MATERIALS AND METHODS. In a retrospective study, 175 renal transplant patients underwent dual-energy CT as part of their follow-up (monoenergetic unenhanced, late contrast-enhanced, and tubular contrast-enhanced dual-energy phases). An unenhanced virtual series and material separation maps were reconstructed. ROIs were marked on theses lesions, the bladder, and the psoas muscle. Material suppressed iodine was used to record attenuation measurements on the unenhanced and virtual unenhanced series in the tubular and late phases, and material concentration measurements were obtained on the iodine density images. The delivered doses for each series were registered. RESULTS. One hundred one renal lesions (spontaneous attenuation > 20 HU, size > 10 mm) were detected. An iodine concentration threshold greater than 1500 μg/mL was associated with excellent diagnostic performance (sensitivity, 100%; specificity, 92.55%; positive predictive value, 50%; negative predictive value, 100%) for detection of suspect lesions (enhancement > 20 HU). The two lesions with an iodine concentration greater than 5000 μg/mL corresponded to the only two histologically proven cancers. CONCLUSION. Iodine concentration maps obtained with dual-energy CT perform as well as enhanced images obtained at conventional CT in the detection and characterization of tissue and atypical cystic renal lesions in kidney transplant recipients. Use of this method could reduce radiation dose, especially by avoiding the unenhanced series."

American journal of roentgenology,2019 04 17,"OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this article is to provide a review of 123I-ioflupane SPECT in the evaluation of suspected parkinsonian syndromes (PSs). This collection of diseases presents frequent diagnostic challenges, even by movement disorder and dementia specialists. CONCLUSION. The 123I-ioflupane scan serves as an imaging biomarker of the status of presynaptic dopamine transporters (DATs) in the striatum. As a result of neuronal death, DATs are greatly reduced in patients with PS neurodegenerative disorders, whereas clinical mimics generally do not show striatal DAT loss. This provides a tremendous opportunity for 123I-ioflupane to aid in the accurate and timely diagnosis of these patients and optimize their management.",CT Staging to Triage Selection of Patients with Poor-Prognosis Rectal Cancer for Neoadjuvant Treatment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995084,AJR. American journal of roentgenology,2019 04 17,"OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study was to evaluate CT as a screening tool for determining high risk of local recurrence of rectal tumors in a scenario of limited MRI availability. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Data were retrospectively analyzed for 180 consecutively registered patients with rectal adenocarcinoma and no previous treatment who underwent baseline CT and MRI staging within 30 days of each other. Two radiologists independently reviewed CT and MR images. CT scans were interpreted in multiplanar reformation. High risk of local recurrence was based on the MRI reference standard: T3cd (more than 5 mm of mesorectal fat infiltration) or T4 disease, N2 nodal status, mesorectal fascia involvement, extramural venous invasion, or positive pelvic sidewall nodes. The performance of CT for determination of high risk of local tumor recurrence was evaluated. RESULTS. Among the 180 patients 128 (71%) met MRI criteria for high risk of local recurrence. CT sensitivity was 84.4% (108/128) and specificity was 78.8% (41/52). The positive predictive value (PPV) of any high-risk CT feature was 90.7% (108/119). When T status was considered, the sensitivity of CT was 75.2% (79/105), specificity was 90.7% (68/75), and PPV was 91.9% (79/86). When tumors within 5.0 cm of the anal verge were excluded, sensitivity was 89.5% (51/57), specificity was 85.7% (24/28), and PPV was 92.7% (51/55). Using CT for disease staging could reduce MRI use by 66%. CONCLUSION. Tumors at high risk of local recurrence can be identified with CT without baseline MRI. Use of CT rather than MRI could markedly reduce costs of baseline staging and shorten time to initiation of neoadjuvant treatment.",Dyslipidemia and the role of the adipose tissue in early pregnancy in the BPH/5 mouse model for preeclampsia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995083,"American journal of physiology.

In total, 11 articles were located through a systematic search of five databases, reference lists, citations and grey literature. These were critically appraised and their results synthesised using meta-ethnography. The quality scores given to included studies were variable, so suggestions are made to improve reporting of future research. Three third-order constructs were developed: (1) emotional needs, (2) informational needs and (3) relational needs. Each relates to parents' needs as they navigate the process of making sense of their child by seeking and adjusting to a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder. Parents' experiences of assessment and diagnosis of their children varied, but these needs were evident across the course of the process. Fathers seemed to find it more difficult than mothers to reconcile having a child with autism spectrum disorder, which may have been grounded in a sense of exclusion from the assessment process. The findings should be considered by professionals working with children, particularly those directly involved in diagnosing autism spectrum disorder. Clinical implications emphasise the need for consideration of parents' emotional needs, provision of information to aid understanding, and strong relationships with professionals. Future clinical research, which should be informed by quality standards, might develop and evaluate standards of assessment and diagnosis, including post-diagnostic support.",International comparisons of autism spectrum disorder behaviors in preschoolers rated by parents and caregivers/teachers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995081,Autism : the international journal of research and practice,2019 04 17,"This study tested international similarities and differences in scores on a scale comprising 12 items identified by international mental health experts as being very consistent with the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th ed.) category of autism spectrum disorder.

Rank ordering of the items with respect to base rates and mean ratings was more similar across societies for parent ratings than caregiver/teacher ratings, especially with respect to the items tapping restricted interests and repetitive behaviors. Items 80. Strange behavior; 63. Repeatedly rocks head or body; 67. Seems unresponsive to affection; and 98. Withdrawn, doesn't get involved with others had low base rates in these population samples across societies and types of informants, suggesting that they may be particularly discriminating for identifying autism spectrum disorder in young children. Cross-informant agreement was stronger for the items tapping social communication and interaction problems than restricted interests and repetitive behaviors.

In Australia, to facilitate such data-sharing and collaborative opportunities, the Neurobiology in Youth Mental Health Partnership was created. This initiative brings together specialised researchers from around Australia to work towards a better understanding of the cross-diagnostic neurobiology of youth mental health and the translation of this knowledge into clinical practice.

Relatives of individuals with autism spectrum disorder, including parents, evidence an increased rate of broader autism phenotype. The goal of this study was to evaluate the association between actor (one's own) and partner (their partner's) broader autism phenotype and the self-reported, observed, and physiological (i.e. electrodermal reactivity) markers of the quality of videotaped couple problem-solving interactions in 158 couples, who had a child with autism spectrum disorder (aged 5-12 years). The mean age of mothers was 39.79 (standard deviation = 5.06) years and the mean age of fathers was 41.77 (standard deviation = 6.02) years for fathers, and 36.6% of parents did not have a college degree. Actor-partner interdependence models, using structural equation modeling in analysis of moment structures, were conducted. Results indicated that parent broader autism phenotype was positively related to adverse couple problem-solving interactions across all measurement methods (observed codes, self-reported affect, and electrodermal reactivity). These effects were independent of child-related challenges. The effect of parent broader autism phenotype occurred through both actor and partner pathways and was strongest for father broader autism phenotype.","Partial Transphyseal Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction: Clinical, Functional, and Radiographic Outcomes.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995077,The American journal of sports medicine,2019 05 02,"With a steadily increasing rate of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury and reconstruction in the pediatric population, disagreement remains regarding the optimal reconstruction technique for patients with ACL injury and ≥2 years of growth remaining.",The Human Lung Cell Atlas - A high-resolution reference map of the human lung in health and disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995076,American journal of respiratory cell and molecular biology,2019 05 29,"Lung disease accounts for every sixth death globally.

The main reason for this is that most excited states are energy saddle points, and hence energy-based optimization methods such as Δ-SCF often collapse to the ground state. Recently, our research group has developed a new method, σ-SCF [ J. Chem. Phys. 2017 , 147 , 214104 ], that successfully solves the ""variational collapse"" problem of energy-based methods. Despite the success, σ-SCF solutions are often spin-contaminated for open-shell states due to the single-determinant nature; unphysical behaviors such as disappearing solutions and discontinuous first-order energy derivatives are also observed along with the spontaneous breaking of spin or spatial symmetries. In this work, we tackle these problems by partially restoring the broken spin-symmetry of a σ-SCF solution through an approximate spin-projection scheme called half-projection. Orbitals of the projected wave function are optimized in a variation-after-projection (VAP) manner. The resulting theory, which we term half-projected (HP) σ-SCF, brings substantial improvement to the description of singlet and triplet excitations of the original σ-SCF method. Numerical simulations on small molecules suggest that HP σ-SCF delivers high-quality excited-state solutions that exist in a wide range of geometries with smooth potential energy surfaces. We also show that local excitations in HP σ-SCF can be size-intensive.","Electrochemical Radical Formyloxylation-Bromination, -Chlorination, and -Trifluoromethylation of Alkenes.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995058,Organic letters,2019 06 13,"Given the versatility and value of the structurally diverse organohalides and CF3-containing compounds in organic synthesis, we reported a green, oxidant-free electrochemical method using undivided electrochemical cells for radical bromination, chlorination and trifluoromethylation-formyloxylation of the various alkenes with readily available halogen radical (NaCl, NaBr), trifluoromethyl radical (CF3SO2Na) sources, and DMF as formyloxylation reagents.

Although the introduction of metal species into the cavity was attempted in aqueous media using the K+/Li+ salt of P8W48, we encountered several challenges: excess metal species are required, and K+ and/or Li+ remain in the cavity. Therefore, controlling the number and arrangement of the introduced metal species proved difficult. In this study, we overcame the aforementioned problems by developing a novel method for introducing metal species in organic media by employing the organic-solvent-soluble tetra- n-butylammonium (TBA) salt of P8W48 (I, TBA12H28[P8W48O184]·30H2O).

Due to its high economic value, honey is considered to be well characterized chemically, and it is often discovered to be an adulterated commodity. However, this study shows that our knowledge of honey protein composition, which is of high medical and pharmaceutical importance, is incomplete. In this in-depth proteomic study of 13 honeys, we identified a number of proteins that are important for an understanding of honey properties and merit additional pharmaceutical research. Our major result is an expanded understanding of the proteins underlying honey's antimicrobial properties, such as hymenoptaecin and defensin-1, glucose dehydrogenase isoforms, venom allergens and other venom-like proteins, serine proteases and serine protease inhibitors, and a series of royal jelly proteins. In addition, we performed quantitative comparisons of all of the proteins previously known or newly identified. The honey proteins, determined using label-free nLC-MS/MS in which the same protein quantity was analyzed in one series, were found in relatively similar proportions, although eucalyptus honey differed most widely from the remaining honeys. Overall, the proteome analysis indicated that honeybees supply proteins to honey in a relatively stable ratio within each proteome, but total protein quantity can differ by approximately an order of magnitude in different honeys.","Design, Synthesis, and Preclinical Characterization of Selective Factor D Inhibitors Targeting the Alternative Complement Pathway.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995036,Journal of medicinal chemistry,2019 05 09,"Complement factor D (FD), a highly specific S1 serine protease, plays a central role in the amplification of the alternative complement pathway (AP) of the innate immune system. Dysregulation of AP activity predisposes individuals to diverse disorders such as age-related macular degeneration, atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome, membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis type II, and paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria. Previously, we have reported the screening efforts and identification of reversible benzylamine-based FD inhibitors (1 and 2) binding to the open active conformation of FD. In continuation of our drug discovery program, we designed compounds applying structure-based approaches to improve interactions with FD and gain selectivity against S1 serine proteases. We report herein the design, synthesis, and medicinal chemistry optimization of the benzylamine series culminating in the discovery of 12, an orally bioavailable and selective FD inhibitor. 12 demonstrated systemic suppression of AP activation in a lipopolysaccharide-induced AP activation model as well as local ocular suppression in intravitreal injection-induced AP activation model in mice expressing human FD.",Parallel Multistream Training of High-Dimensional Neural Network Potentials.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995035,Journal of chemical theory and computation,2019 05 15,"Over the past years high-dimensional neural network potentials (HDNNPs), fitted to accurately reproduce ab initio potential energy surfaces, have become a powerful tool in chemistry, physics and materials science. Here, we focus on the training of the neural networks that lies at the heart of the HDNNP method. We present an efficient approach for optimizing the weight parameters of the neural network via multistream Kalman filtering, using potential energies and forces as reference data. In this procedure, the choice of the free parameters of the Kalman filter can have a significant impact on the fit quality. Carrying out a large parameter study, we determine optimal settings and demonstrate how to optimize training results of HDNNPs. Moreover, we illustrate our HDNNP training approach by revisiting previously presented fits for water and developing a new potential for copper sulfide. This material, accessible in computer simulations so far only via first-principles methods, forms a particularly complex solid structure at low temperatures and undergoes a phase transition to a superionic state upon heating. Analyzing MD simulations carried out with the Cu2S HDNNP, we confirm that the underlying ab initio reference method indeed reproduces this behavior.",Transferability of Local Density-Assisted Implicit Solvation Models for Homogeneous Fluid Mixtures.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995034,Journal of chemical theory and computation,2019 05 15,"The application of bottom-up coarse grained (CG) models to study the equilibrium mixing behavior of liquids is rather challenging, since these models can be significantly influenced by the density or the concentration of the state chosen during parametrization. This dependency leads to low transferability in density/concentration space and has been one of the major limitations in bottom-up coarse graining. Recent approaches proposed to tackle this shortcoming range from the addition of thermodynamic constraints, to an extended ensemble parametrization, to the addition of supplementary terms to the system's Hamiltonian. To study fluid phase equilibria with bottom-up CG models, the application of local density (LD) potentials appears to be a promising approach, as shown in previous work by Sanyal and Shell [T. Sanyal, M. S. Shell, J. Phys. Chem. B, 2018, 122, 5678]. Here, we want to further explore this method and test its ability to model a system which contains structural inhomogeneities only on the molecular scale, namely, solutions of methanol and water. We find that a water-water LD potential improves the transferability of an implicit-methanol CG model toward high water concentration. Conversely, a methanol-methanol LD potential does not significantly improve the transferability of an implicit-water CG model toward high methanol concentration. These differences appear due to the presence of cooperative interactions in water at high concentrations that the LD potentials can capture. In addition, we compare two different approaches to derive our CG models, namely, relative entropy optimization and the Inverse Monte Carlo method, and formally demonstrate under which analytical and numerical assumptions these two methods yield equivalent results.",Maillard-Reacted Whey Protein Isolates and Epigallocatechin Gallate Complex Enhance the Thermal Stability of the Pickering Emulsion Delivery of Curcumin.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995032,Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,2019 05 08,"In this study, whey protein isolates (WPI), lactose (Lac) Maillard-reacted products, and epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) complex were used to enhance the thermal stability of the Pickering emulsion delivery of curcumin. Atomic force microscopy combined with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy were employed to study the morphological characteristics and structural changes of WPI-Lac/EGCG nanoparticles. Results proved that WPI-Lac and EGCG were combined by hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interaction. The mechanism underlying WPI-Lac/EGCG-stabilized Pickering emulsion was further characterized by confocal laser scanning microscopy. The optimal binding ratio of WPI-Lac to EGCG was 1:1 (w/w) at pH 3.0. The particle size and zeta potential of the WPI-Lac/EGCG nanoparticles were about 110 nm and 27 mV, respectively. Analysis of microstructure and droplet size distribution revealed that the glycated WPI-Lac/EGCG-stabilized emulsions exhibited more uniform droplet distribution, stronger thermal stability, and higher curcumin percentage retention than WPI. These results indicate that the WPI-Lac/EGCG nanoparticles are potential stabilizers for Pickering emulsion requirements. This study provides a basis for the construction of Pickering emulsion systems while carrying pro-/hydrophobic bioactive components.",Nobiletin Protects against Systemic Inflammation-Stimulated Memory Impairment via MAPK and NF-κB Signaling Pathways.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995031,Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,2019 05 08,"Neuroinflammation has been intensively demonstrated to be related to various neurodegenerative diseases including Parkinson's disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and Alzheimer's disease (AD). A natural polymethoxylated flavone, nobiletin (NOB) has been reported to alleviate oxidative stress, insulin resistance, and obesity. In this study, we evaluated the protection effects of NOB on neuroinflammation and memory deficit. Three-month mice were administrated with NOB by oral gavage every day for 6 weeks (100 mg/kg/day); subsequently mice were injected intraperitoneally with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for 7 days. Results of behavioral tests revealed that NOB dramatically ameliorated LPS-triggered memory deficit regarding synaptic dysfunctions and neuronal loss. Also, NOB suppressed the microglial activation and proinflammatory cytokine secretion, such as COX-2, IL-1β, TNF-α, and iNOS. Similarly, upon LPS stimulation, pretreatment NOB diminished the secretion of the proinflammatory cytokines in BV-2 microglia cells by exposure to LPS via modulating MAPKs, PI3K/AKT, and NF-κB signaling pathways. In addition, NOB alleviated LPS-amplified redox imbalance, disturbance of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), and dampening of the expression of protein related to mitochondrial respiration. The present study provides compelling evidence that NOB decreased LPS-stimulated neuroinflammation and memory impairment through maintaining cellular oxidative balance and blocking the NF-κB transcriptional pathway, illustrating that the nutritional compound NOB may serve as a potential approach to alleviate neuroinflammation-related diseases.","Estimated Long-Term (1981-2016) Concentrations of Ambient Fine Particulate Matter across North America from Chemical Transport Modeling, Satellite Remote Sensing, and Ground-Based Measurements.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995030,Environmental science & technology,2019 05 07,"Accurate data concerning historical fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations are needed to assess long-term changes in exposure and associated health risks. We estimated historical PM2.5 concentrations over North America from 1981 to 2016 for the first time by combining chemical transport modeling, satellite remote sensing, and ground-based measurements. We constrained and evaluated our estimates with direct ground-based PM2.5 measurements when available and otherwise with historical estimates of PM2.5 from PM10 measurements or total suspended particle (TSP) measurements. The estimated PM2.5 concentrations were generally consistent with direct ground-based PM2.5 measurements over their duration from 1988 onward ( R2 = 0.6 to 0.85) and to a lesser extent with PM2.5 inferred from PM10 measurements from 1985 to 1998 ( R2 = 0.5 to 0.6).

Because regional species richness impact metrics refer to different species compositions, they cannot be easily compared or aggregated to global impacts. Translating regional species richness impacts into global impacts allows for comparisons between impacts and facilitates the estimation of global species extinctions. This requires a conversion (or weighting) factor that takes into account the characteristics of regionally specific species compositions. We developed a methodology for deriving such conversion factors based on species' habitat ranges, International Union for Conservation of Nature threat levels, and species richness. We call these conversion factors global extinction probabilities (GEPs) of the reference location or region. The proposed methodology allows for the calculation of GEPs for any spatial unit and species group for which data on spatial distribution are available and can be implemented in methodologies like life cycle impact assessment. Furthermore, the GEPs can be used for the identification of conservation hot spots. The results of the proposed GEPs (for various taxonomic groups) show that the risk that regional species loss may result in global species extinctions significantly differs per region and informs where irreversible biodiversity impacts are more likely to occur."

To render those transparent materials highly conductive, efficient n- and p- type doping is critically needed to obtain high concentration of free electron and hole carriers. Despite extensive research over the past five decades, high-quality p-type doping of wide-band-gap transparent materials remains a challenge. Here, we summarize four proposed design principles to enhance the p-type conductivity of these wide band gap materials, including (i) reducing the formation energy of the acceptors to enhance the dopant concentration; (ii) lowering the ionization energy and, hence, increasing the ionization of the acceptors to increase the concentration of the free holes; (iii) increasing the VBM of the host material to approaching the pinned Fermi level; and (iv) suppressing the compensating donors to shifting the pinning Fermi level toward the VBM. For each mechanism, we discuss in detail its underlying physics and provided some examples to illustrate the design principles.

Wearable devices are for patients at temporary risk of SCD, when comorbidities prohibit placement of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), or as a bridge to ICD placement or heart transplantation. ICDs are indicated for patients who have survived sudden cardiac arrest (secondary prevention) and patients with conditions that put them at increased risk of SCD (primary prevention).

Patients with suspected venous thromboembolism should be evaluated with the Wells score or modified Wells score (which adds a previous DVT) to determine the likelihood of DVT. A low or moderate probability score and a normal D-dimer test result exclude DVT. If the score indicates that DVT is likely, patients should undergo Doppler ultrasonography (US). If US reveals DVT in a proximal (ie, in the knee or above) vein, anticoagulation should be started unless contraindicated. If the DVT is distal (ie, below the knee), patients can be started on anticoagulation or monitored with repeat US and started on anticoagulation if the clot extends proximally. For anticoagulation, direct oral anticoagulants are recommended for most patients except pregnant women, for whom heparins are recommended. The treatment duration is at least 3 months, and longer if risk factors persist. Indefinite therapy may be required for patients with irreversible risk factors or inherited coagulation disorders.

Besides, as indicated by decreased heart weight/body weight and lung weight/body weight ratio, PTHrP 87 to 139 attenuated pulmonary congestion and cardiac hypertrophy. Masson staining revealed that PTHrP 87 to 139 attenuated myocardial fibrosis after MI. Also, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase mediated dUTP nick-end labeling staining and the expression of cleaved caspase 3 suggested that MI-induced myocytes apotosis was inhibited by PTHrP 87 to 139. In addition to the significantly increased capillary density, PTHrP 87 to 139 treatment also induced p-Akt and several angiogenic factors. In conclusion, PTHrP 87 to 139 treatment preserved cardiac function after MI, and stimulated angiogenesis via upregulating vascular endothelial growth factor and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) in infarct border zone of ischemic myocardium,. These results suggest that PTHrP 87 to 139 is of therapeutic potential for MI.",Ultrasound-guided placement of pigtail cystostomy tubes in dogs with urethral obstruction.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30994963,"Journal of veterinary emergency and critical care (San Antonio, Tex. : 2001)",2019 05 09,"Circumstances such as the inability to pass a retrograde urinary catheter or a lack of surgeon availability may prevent immediate relief of urethral obstruction in dogs.

The plants showed noteworthy differences in microscopy of Wattakaka volubilis having pollinia, translator and corpusculum like structures while pores were visible in Colchicum luteum, Alcea rosea, and Hibiscus syriacus. The spines were observed in Centipeda minima, A. rosea, and H. syriacus being dimorphic spines in A. rosea and monomorphic in H. syriacus. The exine sculpturing pattern was reticulate in mostly studied plants however distinctive exine pattern was noted in Berberis aristata and Berberis lyceum. The highest polar diameter, equatorial diameter and exine thickness among studied plants were observed in H. syriacus (161 μm), C. luteum (50 μm) and Vitis jacquemontii (1.10), respectively.

In this minireview, we systematically summarize the recent progress of optical multiplexed analytical techniques to improve biomedical diagnostics, in which fluorescence and surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) with distinctive optical features are chosen as the main readout signals. Taking advantage of the multiplexed strategies in the biomedical field, a selection of recent contributions from biosensing of multiple chemicals and multicolor cellular tracking to in vivo multiplexed bioimaging are highlighted.

Although some studies have provided targets for novel therapeutic interventions, clinical development of targeted drugs for melanoma still remains obscure. Therefore, this study aims to identify the role of microRNA-27a (miR-27a) in autophagy and apoptosis of melanoma cells in regulating spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK)-mediated the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway. A microarray-based analysis was made to screen differentially expressed genes and predict target miRNA. Melanoma specimens were collected with pigmented nevus as a control. Melanoma cell line Mel-RM was treated with miR-27a inhibitor or pcDNA-SYK to prove their effects on autophagy and apoptosis of melanoma cells. The volume change and tumor mass of nude mice in each group were detected by the tumorigenesis assay. Microarray-based analysis results showed that SYK was lowly expressed in melanoma cells and may be regulated by miR-27a. Besides, miR-27a expression was increased whereas SYK expression was decreased in melanoma tissues. Meanwhile, miR-27a was positively correlated with tumor stage and lymph node metastasis of melanoma tissues. Furthermore, miR-27a targeted SYK and silencing of miR-27a or overexpression of SYK cells promoted autophagy and apoptosis of melanoma cells and reduced their tumorigenic ability in vivo. In conclusion, this study proves that silencing of miR-27a facilitates autophagy and apoptosis of melanoma cells by upregulating SYK expression and activating the mTOR signaling pathway. The finding offers new ideas for the clinical development of melanoma.",Vessel wall and lumen characteristics with age in healthy participants using 3T intracranial vessel wall magnetic resonance imaging.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30994958,Journal of magnetic resonance imaging : JMRI,2019 04 30,"Intracranial vessel wall imaging (VWI) at a clinical field strength of 3T has become more widely available.

The single and well-defined 177 Lu-DTPA complex was radiochemically characterized by paper chromatography, thin-layer chromatography, high-performance liquid chromatography, and electrophoresis techniques. Dependence of the labeling yield of 177 Lu-DTPA complex on different factors was studied in detail. Biological evaluation was also performed in a normal rabbit by developing images under a γ camera at various time intervals. More than 99% labeling yield was obtained by reacting DTPA with 177 Lu at specific conditions (pH 7.0, 15 minutes reaction time at 100 °C). 177 Lu-DTPA complex showed high stability both at room temperature and in vitro. Biodistribution studies in normal mice indicated the fractional renal uptake of intravenously administered 177 Lu-DTPA complex, which reached in the kidneys within 2-3 minutes. Scintigraphy showed rapid clearance from the body. Based on these results, we propose that 177 Lu-DTPA complex might be used as an ideal candidate for functional evaluation of kidneys and the urinary tract, especially when needed to be transported to long-range consumer sites, because of its suitable half-life."

This study investigated the bioaccumulation of heavy metals in the soil-rice system in the Enshi seleniferous area, Central China. Soils were contaminated by Mo, Cu, As, Sb, Zn, Cd, Tl and Hg, due to the weathering of Se-rich shales. Among heavy metals, Cd and Mo have the highest bioavailability in soils. The bioavailable fractions of Cd and Mo account for 41.84% and 10.75% of the total Cd and Mo in soils, respectively. Correspondingly, much higher bioaccumulation factors of Cd (0.34) and Mo (0.46) were found in rice, compared to those of other heavy metals (Zn: 0.16; Cu: 0.05; Hg: 0.04; Sb: 0.0002). We for the first time demonstrated that the uptake of Hg, Cd, and Cu by rice could be inhibited in the presence of Se in soil. The probable daily intake of Se, Cd, Mo, Zn and Cu through consumption of local rice was 252 ± 184 μg/day, 314 ± 301 μg/day, 1774 ± 1326 μg/day, 7.4 ± 1.68 mg/day, and 0.87 ± 0.35 mg/day, respectively. The high hazard quotients of Mo (1.97 ± 1.47) and Cd (5.22 ± 5.02), suggest a high risk of Cd and Mo through consumption of rice for Enshi residents. This article is protected by copyright.

To identify new 4-aminoquinolines to combat American cutaneous leishmaniasis, we carried out a full in vitro evaluation of a series of dehydroxy isoquines and isotebuquines against two Leishmania parasites such as Leishmania braziliensis and Leishmania mexicana. First, the antiproliferative activity of the quinolines was studied against the promastigote forms of L. braziliensis and L. mexicana parasites, finding that five of them exhibited good antileishmanial responses with micromolar IC50 values ranging from 3.84 to 10 μM. A structure-activity relationship analysis gave evidence that a piperidine or a morpholine attached as N-alkyamino terminal substituent as well as the inclusion of an extra phenyl ring attached at the aniline ring of the isotebuquine core constitute important pharmacophores to generate the most active derivatives, with antileishmanial responses by far superior to those found for the reference drug, glucantime. All compounds showed a relatively low toxicity on human dermis fibroblasts, with CC50 ranging from 69 to >250 μM. The five most active compounds displayed moderate to good antileishmanial activity against the intracellular amastigote form of L. braziliensis, compared to the reference drug. In particular, compound 2j was identified as the most potent agent against antimony-resistant amastigotes of L. braziliensis with acceptable biological response and selectivity, emerging as a promising candidate for further in vivo antileishmanial evaluation.

Yet so far, there is very limited rheological and microstructural information to assist in proper utilization of CPI -Ch complex coacervates. The rheological and microstructural properties of the complex coacervates formed from CPI and chitosan Ch at various CPI-to-Ch mixing ratios (1:1, 16:1, 20:1, and 30:1) and pH values (5.0, 6.0, and 7.0) were therefore investigated. These CPI-Ch complex coacervate phases were found to exhibit elastic behavior as evidenced by significantly higher elastic modulus (G') compared to viscous modulus (G″) in all the tested ratios and pH ranges. They also exhibited shear-thinning behavior during viscous flow. The complex coacervates formed at the optimum CPI-to-Ch ratio of 16:1 and pH of 6.0 demonstrated the highest G', G″, and shear viscosity, which correlated well with the high strength of electrostatic interaction and thick-walled, sponge-like, less-porous microstructure at this condition. The higher shear viscosity of the coacervate at pH 6.0 was most likely induced by stronger attractive electrostatic interactions between CPI and Ch molecules, due to the formation of a rather densely packed complex coacervate structure. Hence, it can be concluded that the microstructural observations of denser structure correlated well with the rheological findings of stronger intermolecular bonds at the optimum CPI-to-Ch ratio of 16:1 and pH of 6.0. The complex coacervate phase formed at a CPI-to-Ch ratio of 16:1 and pH of 6.0 also showed glassy consistency at low temperatures and rubbery consistency above its glass-transition temperature. This study identified the potential for the newly developed CPI-Ch complex coacervate to be used as an encapsulating material due to its favorable strength. This would drastically reduce the wastage of byproducts, provide a solution to tackle the pressing global issue of wastage of byproducts, and bring about a more environmentally friendly paradigm.",Main features and applications of organogels in cosmetics.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30994939,International journal of cosmetic science,2019 04 17,"Cosmetic treatments aim at improving skin appearance through vehicles of good sensory properties.

In this review, we discuss the properties and characteristics of organogels and present the advantages of the application of these systems in cosmetics.","Fabella prevalence rate increases over 150 years, and rates of other sesamoid bones remain constant: a systematic review.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30994938,Journal of anatomy,2019 04 17,"The fabella is a sesamoid bone located behind the lateral femoral condyle. It is common in non-human mammals, but the prevalence rates in humans vary from 3 to 87%. Here, we calculate the prevalence of the fabella in a Korean population and investigate possible temporal shifts in prevalence rate. A total of 52.83% of our individuals and 44.34% of our knees had fabellae detectable by computed tomography scanning. Men and women were equally likely to have a fabella, and bilateral cases (67.86%) were more common than unilateral ones (32.14%). Fabella presence was not correlated with height or age, although our sample did not include skeletally immature individuals. Our systematic review yielded 58 studies on fabella prevalence rate from 1875-2018 which met our inclusion criteria, one of which was an outlier. Intriguingly, a Bayesian mixed effects generalized linear model revealed a temporal shift in prevalence rates, with the median prevalence rate in 2000 (31.00%) being ~ 3.5 times higher than that in 1900 (7.64%). In all four countries with studies before and after 1960, higher rates were always found after 1960. Using data from two other systematic reviews, we found no increase in prevalence rates of 10 other sesamoid bones in the human body, indicating that the increase in fabella prevalence rate is unique. Fabella presence/absence is due to a combination of genetic and environmental factors: as the prevalence rates of other sesamoid bones have not changed in the last 100 years, we postulate the increase in fabella prevalence rate is due to an environmental factor. Namely, the global increase in human height and weight (due to improved nutrition) may have increased human tibial length and muscle mass. Increases in tibial length could lead to a larger moment arm acting on the knee and on the tendons crossing it. Coupled with the increased force from a larger gastrocnemius, this could produce the mechanical stimuli necessary to initiate fabella formation and/or ossification.",Gut microbiome interventions in human health and diseases.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30994937,Medicinal research reviews,2019 04 17,"Ongoing studies have determined that the gut microbiota is a major factor influencing both health and disease.

This study has been focused mainly on kernel, although the whole plant of purple corn is a potential source of anthocyanins. First, general parameters of extraction (solvent system, solvent-to-solid ratio, number of extractions, and acid type) were established depending on the total anthocyanins content. Then, three extraction methods to access anthocyanins were compared: maceration extraction (ME), ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE), and microwave-assisted extraction (MAE). Since the residual material still possessed an intense color, a further treatment was performed by application of enzymatic-assisted extraction (EAE). Three enzymatic cocktails (Xylanases, Celluclast, and Depol), pH, and temperature were evaluated to establish optimal reaction conditions. Subsequent analysis and identification of the anthocyanins obtained by four different extraction techniques were performed using HPLC and HPLC-mass spectrometry, respectively. The most efficient method was UAE using 20 min of ultrasound (100 W) preceded by sample treatment in the following conditions: ethanol/water/lactic acid mixture (80:19:1), two extractions, 1:10 solvent-to-solid ratio. As a result, anthocyanins from corn cob and corn husk were extracted at concentrations of 24.32 and 25.80 mg/gDW, respectively. No difference in the anthocyanins profile for samples extracted by three different methods was observed. However, an enhanced presence of cyanidin-3-(6''malonyl)glucoside was detected in the sample corresponding to the EAE method. Therefore, the Cahuacintle corn husk can be considered as a competitive source of anthocyanins with the available commercial sources. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: The by-products obtained from Cacahuacintle purple corn can be potentially used as natural colorants thanks to their anthocyanins content. In this work, we established the most efficient extraction method of anthocyanins from corn husk and corn cob, and demonstrated that their anthocyanins profile is comparable to other Peruvian purple corns, which are currently used as natural colorants. Therefore, the extraction procedure described in this study might be scaled-up in an industrial process to get access to anthocyanins from undervalued wastes.","Effect of Brine Acidification on Fermentation Microbiota, Chemistry, and Texture Quality of Cucumbers Fermented in Calcium or Sodium Chloride Brines.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30994935,Journal of food science,2019 05 08,"Commercial fermentation for bulk preservation of cucumbers relies on natural microbiota and approximately 1 M sodium chloride (NaCl) brines, resulting in large volumes of high-salt wastewater. An alternative process utilizing 0.1 M calcium chloride (CaCl2 ) as the only salt was developed to eliminate NaCl from fermentation brines for reduced environmental impact. This study determined the effect of brine acidification on the fermentation microbiota and texture quality of cucumbers fermented in CaCl2 brines. Cucumber fermentations were conducted in sealed glass jars for six independent lots of cucumbers in a randomized complete block design with a full-factorial treatment structure for brine acidification (acetic acid, hydrochloric acid, or nonacidified) and brining salt (1 M NaCl or 0.1 M CaCl2 ). Enterobacteriaceae spp. survived longer and were >1 log colony forming units/mL higher in fermenting cucumbers than in brines. Addition of 25 mM acetic acid to fermentation brines (but not the addition of hydrochloric acid at the same pH) reduced Enterobacteriaceae spp. in brines and cucumbers (P < 0.002) during the initiation of fermentation for both brining salts. However, acidification had no effect on texture quality of fermented cucumbers (P = 0.8235). Despite differences in early fermentation microbiota, fermentation of cucumbers in calcium chloride brines under controlled conditions, with or without acidification, resulted in high retention of tissue firmness. These results differ from fermentations in a commercial setting initiated in brines of neutral pH, indicating that production variables, such as air exposure, interact with brining in CaCl2 to negatively affect the texture quality of fermented cucumbers. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: This study examined the effects of initial brine acidification on the course of lactic acid fermentation and resulting texture quality of cucumbers fermented in calcium or sodium salt brines. Fermentation brines containing acetic acid (the acid in vinegar) reduced the pH of the cucumber and the soil-associated Enterobacteriaceae spp. most rapidly, and favored the conversion of sugars to lactic acid. Interestingly, the texture quality was not affected by brine acidification, and all cucumbers fermented in calcium brines in the absence of air retained their firmness during fermentation and bulk storage."

However, the mechanisms underlying heat-stress effects on B. napus seed photosynthesis and oil accumulation remain elusive. In this study we showed that heat stress resulted in reduction of seed oil accumulation, whereas the seed sugar content was enhanced, which indicated that incorporation of carbohydrates into triacylglycerols was impaired. Photosynthesis and respiration rates, and the maximum quantum yield of photosystem II in developing seeds were inhibited by heat stress. Transcriptome analysis revealed that heat stress led to up-regulation of genes associated with high light response, providing evidence that photoinhibition was induced by heat stress. BnWRI1 and its downstream genes, including genes involved in de novo fatty acid biosynthesis pathway, were down-regulated by heat-stress. Overexpression of BnWRI1 with a seed-specific promoter stabilized both oil accumulation and photosynthesis under the heat-stress condition, which suggested BnWRI1 plays an important role in mediating the effect of heat stress on fatty acid biosynthesis. A number of sugar transporter genes were inhibitedby heat stress, resulting in defective integration of carbohydrates into triacylglycerols units. The results collectively demonstrated that disturbances of the seed photosynthesis machinery, impairment of carbohydrates incorporation into triacylglycerols, and transcriptional deregulation of the BnWRI1 pathway by heat stress might be the major cause of decreased oil accumulation in the seed.",Predicting Early Mild Cognitive Impairment With Free Recall: The Primacy of Primacy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30994919,Archives of clinical neuropsychology : the official journal of the National Academy of Neuropsychologists,2019 04 17,"Serial position effects have been found to discriminate between normal and pathological aging, and to predict conversion from Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer's disease (AD).

It is caused when shed endometrial tissue travels retrograde into the lower abdominal cavity. Endometriosis is the most common cause of chronic pelvic pain in women and is associated with infertility. The underlying pathologic mechanisms in the intracavitary endometrium and extra-uterine endometriotic tissue involve defectively programmed endometrial mesenchymal progenitor/stem cells. While endometriotic stromal cells, which compose the bulk of endometriotic lesions, do not carry somatic mutations, they demonstrate specific epigenetic abnormalities that alter expression of key transcription factors. For example, GATA-binding factor-6 overexpression transforms an endometrial stromal cell to an endometriotic phenotype, and steroidogenic factor-1 overexpression causes excessive production of estrogen, which drives inflammation via pathologically high levels of estrogen receptor-β. Progesterone receptor deficiency causes progesterone resistance. Populations of endometrial and endometriotic epithelial cells also harbor multiple cancer-driver mutations, such as KRAS, which may be associated with the establishment of pelvic endometriosis or ovarian cancer. It is not known how interactions between epigenomically defective stromal cells and the mutated genes in epithelial cells contribute to the pathogenesis of endometriosis. Endometriosis-associated pelvic pain is managed by suppression of ovulatory menses and estrogen production, cyclooxygenase inhibitors, and surgical removal of pelvic lesions, and in vitro fertilization is frequently used to overcome infertility. Although novel targeted treatments are becoming available, as endometriosis pathophysiology is better understood, preventive approaches such as long-term ovulation suppression may play a critical role in the future.",Computational identification of prion-like RNA-binding proteins that form liquid phase-separated condensates.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30994888,"Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)",2019 04 17,"Eukaryotic cells contain different membrane-delimited compartments, which are crucial for the biochemical reactions necessary to sustain cell life.

The main data of this study were self-referred voice-related problems teaching, leisure-time physical activity (defined according to its intensity, duration and frequency) and potential confounding variables. The data was analyzed using Poisson regression models with robust variance. Around one fifth of teachers (20.5%) reported having had voice-related problems teaching, while approximately one third reported sufficient leisure-time physical activity (≥ 150 minutes/week) (37.8%). Both recommended physical activity volume and five or more days of physical activity per week (regardless of total volume) were inversely associated with voice-related problems teaching, both in bivariate models and in models adjusted for confounding variables (sex, age and working hours).

To estimate infructescence fruit volume consumed, collectors were installed in fruit-bearing palms. To characterize consumption from the ground, samples were placed next to fruiting palms. To identify wildlife and their activities, camera traps were installed in infructescences and on the ground. The results suggested that there was a small fruit surplus (1.8 %), and this finding indicated the possibility of a harvest to reduce food for the wildlife. However, recurrent variations in the annual fruit production (21.4 %) were also noted, and suggested that wildlife could tolerate some fruit harvesting. Thus, a harvest could be restricted to fruit volume that exceeds the annual average (94 kg/ha/year). Turdus flavipes, a migratory bird, was the most active species in the dispersal of seeds; this finding indicates the need for broader conservation strategies. Wildlife composition also changed along with the fruiting, and this alteration suggests that dependence on the fruit is variable among different species.

A factorial arrangement was used to examine the impact of treatments on growth performance and body measurements of ostrich chicks during 2 to 10 weeks of the age. Results indicated that factors studied did not change growth performance traits. The highest value of protein efficiency ratio was observed in ostrich chicks fed diet contained 240 g/kg diet. Birds fed diet contained 240 g CP /kg diet and kept at stocking density of 3 m2 per bird had numerically the highest protein efficiency ratio. Shank girth and tibiotarsus length decreased with increasing dietary CP level. Stocking density did not change values of body measurements, except tibiotarsus length at 6 weeks of age, which increased in birds kept at the lower density than the higher. Body height at 10 weeks of age was significantly affected by the interactions between dietary CP and stocking density. In conclusion, results affirmed that ostrich chicks can grow on diets containing low levels of CP (180-210 g/kg).

To evaluate the activity of histatin 5 and human lactoferrin against biofilm formation. A fluconazole-resistant Candida albicans clinical isolate was used as the model microorganism. Morphogenesis was evaluated by differential counting. Biofilm quantification was performed by XTT reduction assay. Thickness and topography of biofilms were assessed through confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). Histatin 5 inhibited yeast-to-hyphae transition in a dose-dependent manner, while the effect of human lactoferrin on this process was inversely proportional to its concentration. Both compounds were able to significantly inhibit biofilm metabolic activity. Histatin 5 reduced biofilm thickness.

Animals were divided into four groups (n=6 each): control (without supplementation), and groups supplemented on days 50 and 70 of life with (PhSe)2, Zn, and a combination of (PhSe)2 and Zn. Animals treated with (PhSe)2 gained more weight by experimental day 220 than did the control group, but there was no difference by the end of the experiment (day 300). The absolute number of leukocytes and lymphocytes increased in groups Zn and (PhSe)2+Zn on day 20 of experiment, but decreased on day 40 in groups (PhSe)2, and (PhSe)2+Zn. The number of monocytes decreased in all groups compared with control. One of the principal findings was that (PhSe)2+Zn together had beneficial effects on protein metabolism, represented by increases total protein and globulin levels, compared with the control group. The combination of (PhSe)2 and Zn led to low levels of TBARS and ROS in serum and muscle, and stimulated antioxidant enzyme activities.

The aim of this work was to analyze relevant population parameters of Hyalellapampeana, such as population density and structure, individual body size, sex ratio, fecundity and recruitment, and to study the possible relation of these parameters to variations in environmental variables. Samples were taken monthly during a one-year period (2006) at three small ponds in the Natural Reserve Island of Martín García, Argentina. The inland aquatic environments showed distinctive physicochemical characteristics, mainly related to pH and conductivity values. Amphipod population density varied among sites and throughout the year, with population peaks during spring, positively correlating with pH values. The operational sex ratio of the total population was almost equal to 1 male: 1 female, displaying seasonal variation. Mean fecundity and mean size of ovigerous females were higher during winter and early spring months than in summer months. The presence of ovigerous females and juveniles in all months indicated that reproduction is continuous during the year for Hyalella, in its natural environment.","Useful plants and their relation to archaeological sites in the Serra de Carajás, Brazil.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30994748,Anais da Academia Brasileira de Ciencias,2019 05 21,"Multidisciplinary studies including archeology and ethnobotany that seek to understand human interventions on the landscape have obtained important results concerning Amazon biodiversity.

An assessment of the plants use potential by family was done using regression analysis for the taxa inventoried. All the phytophysiognomies studied in the vicinity of archaeological sites were expressive regarding useful species. The most representative categories were medicinal, material, game attractant, firewood and food. The floristic features related to the use of plant species by family were also expressive for Fabaceae, Myrtaceae and Chrysobalanaceae.

It is possible to find in the literature different proposals to subdivide the Pantanal plain, which vary in total area and number of sub-regions. Each author uses specific criteria - mainly vegetation, soil and humidity - in his delimitation, but does not consider the tectonic aspects of the basin. In this sense, we intend to analyze three Pantanal delimitations from the literature and to relate them to the neotectonic context of the Pantanal plain by comparing the boundaries proposed in the delimitations to structural lineaments present in the basin. As a result, we observe that the comparison of the Pantanal boundaries with the lineaments shows a high compatibility between them, suggesting the influence of these structures in the development of the sub-regions.","Reproductive aspects of the semi-aquatic snake Erythrolamprus miliaris (Dipsadidae: Xenodontini) in the state of Rio de Janeiro, southeastern Brazil.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30994745,Anais da Academia Brasileira de Ciencias,2019 05 21,"We analyzed some aspects of reproduction and sexual dimorphism of the semi-aquatic dipsadid snake Erythrolamprus miliaris in the state of Rio de Janeiro, southeastern Brazil. We detected sexual dimorphism in body size (snout-vent length), with females averaging larger than males, but no sexual dimorphism in the relative length of the tail. Oviductal eggs and secondary follicles were found in all seasons, suggesting that female reproductive cycles are continuous, in spite of the tropical seasonal climate in the region. Reproductive males were present throughout the year, suggesting a continuous cycle for males as well. Clutch size averaged 10.3 ± 4.8 (range 4-21) and there was a positive and significant relationship between clutch size and female size. Compared to conspecific populations previously studied in other Atlantic Rainforest areas, populations of E. miliaris from the state of Rio de Janeiro appear more similar overall in their reproductive traits to a more northern population from the state of Bahia than to populations from further south in the states of São Paulo and Paraná."

The objective of this study was to evaluate the distribution of lymphocyte subsets in untreated SLE patients with infections. This was a cross-sectional study. Data from January 2017 to May 2018 were collected. Flow cytometry was used to measure the peripheral lymphocyte subsets including CD3+T cells, CD4+T cells, CD8+T cells, CD19+B cells, CD3-CD16+CD56NK cells, and CD3+CD16+CD56NKT cells in 25 healthy controls and 52 treatment-naive SLE patients, among whom 13 were complicated with infections. Association between the lymphocyte subsets and infections was further analyzed. SLE patients with infections (n=13) showed a significantly higher incidence rate of fever (84.6 vs 28.2%) and serositis (84.6 vs 23.1%), increased level of erythrocyte sedimentation rate (60.5±30.1 vs 37.4±27.1 mm/h), serum C-reactive protein (CRP) (102.7±94.9 vs 9.4±14.9 mg/L), procalcitonin (PCT) (1.07±0.08 vs 0.16±0.13 μg/L), and lower blood hemoglobin (Hb) (93.0±20.5 vs 110.4±16.0 g/L) level compared with non-infection patients (n=39) (all P<0.05). In comparison with non-infectious SLE patients (387.9±261.6/μL), CD4+T cells count decreased significantly in infectious SLE patients (217.8±150.4/μL) (P<0.05), and it was negatively correlated with infection-related indicators including PCT (r=-0.573, P=0.041) and CRP (r=-0.596, P=0.032) levels.

The concentrations of prolactin (PRL) and growth hormone (GH) in culture supernatant of GH3 cells were assessed using ELISA. The targeting relationship between miR-130b and FOXM1 was verified using dual luciferase activity. Finally, the expression levels of key factors involved in PI3K/AKT/mTOR and JAK1/STAT3 pathways were evaluated using western blotting. We found that HULC was highly expressed in GH3 cells. Overexpression of HULC promoted GH3 cell viability, migration, invasion, PRL and GH secretion, as well as activated PI3K/AKT/mTOR and JAK1/STAT3 pathways. Knockdown of HULC had opposite effects and induced cell apoptosis. HULC negatively regulated the expression of miR-130b, and miR-130b participated in the effects of HULC on GH3 cells. FOXM1 was a target gene of miR-130b, which was involved in the regulation of GH3 cell viability, migration, invasion, and apoptosis, as well as PI3K/AKT/mTOR and JAK1/STAT3 pathways. In conclusion, HULC tumor-promoting roles in secreting pituitary adenoma might be via down-regulating miR-130b, up-regulating FOXM1, and activating PI3K/AKT/mTOR and JAK1/STAT3 pathways.",Hydrogen sulfide protects H9c2 cardiomyoblasts against H2O2-induced apoptosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30994729,Brazilian journal of medical and biological research = Revista brasileira de pesquisas medicas e biologicas,2019 05 29,"Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are highly reactive chemical species that may cause irreversible tissue damage, and play a critical role in cardiovascular diseases.

H9c2 rat cardiomyoblasts were treated with H2S (100 μM) 24 h before challenging with H2O2 (100 μM). Apoptosis was then assessed by annexin V and PI, and mitochondrial membrane potential was measured using a fluorescent probe, JC-1. Our results revealed that H2S improved cell viability, reduced the apoptotic rate, and preserved mitochondrial membrane potential. An increased Bcl-2 to Bax ratio was also seen in myocytes treated with H2S after H2O2-induced stress.

In this work, an innovative fluorescence method is proposed for simultaneous detection of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). A polydopamine nanosphere@silver nanocluster (PDAN@AgNC) system is introduced for fluorescence quenching and recovery. The AgNCs with different emissions are synthesized using different DNA templates, which also contain aptamer sequences towards AFP and CEA, respectively. These single-stranded DNA sequences could be adsorbed on the surface of the PDAN through π-π stacking, which results in the quenching of AgNCs. However, in the presence of the corresponding tumor marker, the aptamer/target complex forms which releases AgNCs from the surface of the PDAN and the recovered fluorescence could be used to indicate the concentration of the tumor marker.

The use of Computer-Assisted Structure Elucidation (CASE) programs can minimize this risk by generating all structures that are consistent with the input data and by ranking these structures in order of probability. They can successfully determine structures for complex natural products, with the possible exception of compounds with very few protons. Current CASE programs utilize mainly 2D COSY and HMBC correlation data for structure generation with a starting assumption that all observed peaks are due to pairs of atoms no more than 3 bonds apart. We discuss these assumptions and the problems that occur when they are violated. We also discuss the advantages and disadvantages of other types of 2D data that could be included at the structure generation stage. Four different CASE programs are described with particular emphasis on how they deal with the presence of longer range correlation peaks. These programs provide only planar skeletal structures. However, a new program that relies on different types of stereospecific NMR data to determine 3D structures is also described. Other types of computer assistance for structure elucidation are discussed, including the increasing use of theoretical DFT calculations to determine 3D structures and to predict chemical shifts. Finally, we suggest possible improvements in these programs and suggest that a challenge match between the developers of current CASE programs would be useful.",Lysosome-targeted carbon dots for ratiometric imaging of formaldehyde in living cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30994690,Nanoscale,2019 04 26,"Formaldehyde (FA) is involved in many biological processes and is closely connected with many diseases including Alzheimer's disease and cancer.

This nanocomposite yarn can be fabricated as artificial muscles by directly inflating epoxy resin on spring-like carbon nanotube yarn, and it shows a rapid response, and reversible and controllable deformation. The driving mechanism of the nanocomposite yarn artificial muscle is based on the change in the resin modulus controlled by Joule heat. This novel nanocomposite yarn artificial muscle can work at low voltages (≤0.8 V), and the whole reversible driving process is completed within 5 seconds (the deformation recovery process is about 2 seconds). The strain of the nanocomposite yarn artificial muscle is controlled by applied voltages, and the maximum strain can reach more than 12%. The novel nanocomposite yarn artificial muscle can produce output forces more than 20 times higher than human skeletal muscle. This CNT nanocomposite yarn artificial muscle with a spiral structure shows potential applications for actuators, sensors and micro robots.","Ca-, Sr-, and Ba-Coordination polymers based on anthranilic acid via mechanochemistry.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30994686,"Dalton transactions (Cambridge, England : 2003)",2019 05 17,"Ca-, Sr-, and Ba-Based coordination polymers (CPs) were prepared mechanochemically by milling metal-hydroxide samples with anthranilic acid (oABAH). {[Ca(oABA)2(H2O)3]}n (1) consists of one-dimensional polymeric chains that are further connected by a hydrogen-bonding network. {[Sr(oABA)2(H2O)2]·H2O}n (2) is a one-dimensional CP in which water molecules bridge Sr2+ ions and increase the dimensionality by building an extended network. {[Ba(oABA)2(H2O)]}n (3) crystallizes as a two-dimensional CP comprising one bridging water molecule.

The simulation results showed that the adsorption of the three peptides onto the HAP(001) surface was primarily driven by salt-bridge and electrostatic attraction in calcium phosphate (Ca/P) and sodium chloride (NaCl) solutions, respectively. SN15 adsorbs on the HAP surface with the strongest electrostatic interaction, while SNS15 is the weakest. Besides, Ca2+ around SN15 can form an equilateral triangle, which resembles the structure formed by Ca(2) ions in the HAP(001) crystal face, and this looks like the initial stage of HAP nucleation. The conformational changes of SN15 on HAP are analyzed by the root-mean-square deviation. It shows that SN15 is more stable in Ca/P solution while SNS15 is more stable in NaCl solution; the stability of SNA15 is almost the same in both solutions.

There is an inherent relation between the dynamical structure of the polymeric membrane and the electrostatic forces that drive membrane segregation and proton transport. Here, we used a multi-scale computational approach to analyze the morphology of sulfonated poly(ether ether ketone) membranes at the mesoscale. A self-consistent description of the electrostatic phenomenon was adopted, where discrete polymer chains and a continuum proton field were embedded in a continuum fluid. Brownian dynamics was used for the evolution of the suspended polymer molecules, while a convection-diffusion transport equation, including the Nernst-Planck diffusion mechanism, accounted for the dynamics of the proton concentration field. We varied the polymer concentration, the degree of sulfonation and the level of confinement to find relationships between membrane structure and proton conduction. Our results indicate that the reduced mobility of polymer chains, at concentrations above overlap, and a moderate degree of sulfonation - i.e., 30% - are essential elements for membrane segregation and proton domain connectivity. These conditions also ensure that the membrane structure is not affected by size or by potential gradients. Importantly, our analysis shows that membrane conductivity and current are linearly dependent on polymer concentration and quadratically dependent on the degree of sulfonation. We found that the optimal polymeric membrane design requires a polymer concentration above overlap and a degree of sulfonation around 50%. These conditions promote a dynamical membrane morphology with a constant density of proton channels.

For the cylindrical nanopores, water permeability increases with increasing the nanopore diameter (2.05, 3.10 and 7.62 nm). Due to the strong interaction of water with the hydrophilic pore surface, the effective viscosity of water in the nanopore is greater than the bulk viscosity; consequently, the simulated permeability is lower than the prediction by the Hagen-Poiseuille (HP) equation. For the conical nanopores with various apex angles (α = 0°, 9.6°, 19.2°, 28.9°, 38.9° and 49.2°), water permeability is predicted to be higher than the cylindrical counterparts and is the highest when α = 19.2°. The potentials of mean force reveal that the barrier for water permeation through the cylindrical nanopore is high and continuous over the entire nanopore, whereas the barrier through the conical nanopore is lower. Moreover, the nanofiltration of two solutes (sucralose and bisphenol A) is simulated. In the presence of solute, water permeability is reduced to a certain extent. Compared with hydrophobic bisphenol A, hydrophilic sucralose interacts more strongly with the nanopore, thus causing a greater pore blockage and a larger reduction in water permeability. This simulation study provides atomistic insights into the key factors governing water permeation through alumina nanopores, and validates the idea that water permeation can be enhanced using conical nanopores.",Analytical performance of μ-groove silicon attenuated total reflection waveguides.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30994644,The Analyst,2019 05 14,"The analytical performance of micromachined μ-groove silicon attenuated total reflection (ATR) elements has been evaluated in a comparison of Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) and quantum cascade laser (QCL) spectroscopy operating at mid-infrared (MIR) wavelengths. μ-Groove silicon ATR elements are highly efficient micromachined waveguides fabricated at a wafer scale at such low cost that they may be considered a consumable for single-time-use, e.g., in medical application scenarios.

Here, an oxygen self-supplied nanodelivery system that is based on nanometal-organic frameworks (nMOFs) with embedded AuNPs (Au@ZIF-8) on the nMOF surface as a catalase (CAT)-like nanozyme and encapsulating Ce6 inside as a photosensitizer was found to mitigate tumor hypoxia and reinforce PDT. As soon as Au@ZIF-8 reaches the tumor site, the AuNP nanozyme can catalyze excessive H2O2 to produce O2 to alleviate tumor hypoxia, promoting the production of 1O2 with strong toxicity toward tumor cells under irradiation. Our study demonstrates that nMOFs embellished with a nanozyme have great potential for overcoming the THME for cancer therapeutics, which provides a facile strategy for accurate bioimaging and cancer therapy in vivo.","An NHC-catalyzed, stereoselective α-functionalization of α,β-unsaturated carboxylic acids through in situ activation.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30994641,Organic & biomolecular chemistry,2019 05 09,"An N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC)-catalyzed α-functionalization of the in situ activated α,β-unsaturated carboxylic acids bearing γ-H was realized through formal [4 + 2] annulations with o-quinone methides, which paved a new avenue for the assembly and modification of the dihydrocoumarin scaffold in good yields with excellent diastereo- and enantioselectivities.",Singlet oxygen phosphorescence detection in vivo identifies PDT-induced anoxia in solid tumors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30994640,Photochemical & photobiological sciences : Official journal of the European Photochemistry Association and the European Society for Photobiology,2019 06 12,"Real-time surveillance of photodynamic therapy (PDT) has been desired by the research community for a long time. The impact of the treatment is encoded in the phosphorescence kinetics of its main mediator: singlet oxygen. We report successful in vivo measurements of these weak kinetics through the skin of living mice after systemic drug application. Using special high transmission optics centered around 1200, 1270 and 1340 nm, singlet oxygen phosphorescence can be clearly discriminated from other signals. N-(2-Hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide copolymers conjugated with pyropheophorbide-a exhibit highly selective accumulation in tumors. Signals of this drug in tumors were compared to those in normal tissue. In both places, the major part of the signal could be identified as arising from drug still circulating in the bloodstream. Despite high concentrations of extravasated drug in the tumors due to the EPR effect, nearly no signal could be detected from these photosensitizers in vivo, contradicting in vitro experiments. We propose that the reason for this discrepancy is oxygen depletion in tumor tissue in vivo, even at moderate (at PDT scale) illumination intensities, soon after the start of the illumination. These results underline the importance of singlet oxygen surveillance during PDT treatment.","Electrospray ionization photoelectron spectroscopy of cryogenic [EDTA·M(ii)]2- complexes (M = Ca, V-Zn): electronic structures and intrinsic redox properties.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30994639,Faraday discussions,2019 04 17,"We report here a systematic photoelectron spectroscopy (PES) and theoretical study of divalent transition metal (TM) EDTA complexes [EDTA·TM(ii)]2- (TM = V-Zn), along with the Ca(ii) species for comparison. Gaseous TM dianions (TM = Ca, Mn, Co, Ni, Cu and Zn) were successfully generated via electrospray ionization, and their PE spectra, with 157, 193, and 266 nm photons, were obtained at 20 K. The spectrum of each TM complex shows an extra peak at the lowest electron binding energy (eBE), compared to that of [EDTA·Ca(ii)]2-. DFT calculations indicate a hexacoordinated metal-EDTA binding motif for all complexes, from which the vertical detachment energies (VDEs) are calculated and these agree well with the experimental values. The calculations further predict negative or very small VDEs for TM(ii) = V, Cr, and Fe, providing a rational explanation for why these three dianionic species are not observed in the gas phase. Direct spectral comparison, electron spin density differences, and MO analyses indicate that the least bound electrons are derived from TM d electrons with appreciable ligand contributions, in contrast to [EDTA·Ca(ii)]2-, in which the detachment is entirely derived from the ligand. The extent of ligand modulation, i.e. non-innocence of EDTA ligands in the oxidation process, is found to vary across the 3rd row of TMs. Comparing the gas-phase VDEs of [EDTA·TM(ii)]2- with the 3rd ionization potentials of TMs and solution phase oxidation potentials reveals intrinsic correlations among these three quantities, with deviations being largely modulated by the ligand participation. The detailed microscopic information about the intrinsic electronic structures and bonding motifs of these complexes obtained in this work will help better understand the rich redox chemistries of these ubiquitous species under diverse environments. The present work, along with our previous studies, indicates that PES coupled with electrospray ionization is a unique ion spectroscopic tool that not only provides intrinsic electronic structure and bonding information about redox species, but also can predict the related electron transfer chemistries with quantitative capability.","Acceptorless dehydrogenative construction of C[double bond, length as m-dash]N and C[double bond, length as m-dash]C bonds through catalytic aza-Wittig and Wittig reactions in the presence of an air-stable ruthenium pincer complex.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30994638,"Dalton transactions (Cambridge, England : 2003)",2019 05 17,"The construction of C[double bond, length as m-dash]N bonds was achieved by the dehydrogenative coupling of alcohol and azide via aza-Wittig type reaction.

Herein, we employ vibronic photodissociation spectroscopy of cryogenic M+LF complexes composed of lumiflavin (LF, C13H12N4O2), the parent molecule of the flavin family, and alkali ions (M = Li-Cs) to characterize the strong impact of metalation on the electronic properties of the LF chromophore. With the aid of time-dependent density functional theory calculations (PBE0/cc-pVDZ) coupled to multidimensional Franck-Condon simulations, the visible photodissociation (VISPD) spectra of M+LF ions recorded in the 500-570 nm range are assigned to the S1 ← S0 (ππ*) transitions into the first optically bright S1 state of the lowest-energy M+LF(O4+) isomers. In this O4+ structure, M+ binds in a bent chelate to the lone pairs of both the O4 and the N5 atom of LF. Charge reorganization induced by S1 excitation strongly enhances the interaction between M+ and LF at this binding site, leading to substantial red shifts in the S1 absorption of the order of 10-20% (e.g., from 465 nm in LF to 567 nm in Li+LF). This strong change in M+LF interaction strength in M+LF(O4+) upon ππ* excitation can be rationalized by the orbitals involved in the S1 ← S0 transition and causes strong vibrational activity. In particular, progressions in the intermolecular bending and stretching modes provide an accurate measure of the strength of the M+LF bond. In contrast to the experimentally identified O4+ ions, the predicted S1 origins of other low-energy M+LF isomers, O2+ and O2, are slightly blue-shifted from the S1 of LF, demonstrating that the electronic properties of metalated LF not only drastically change with the size of the metal ion but also with its binding site."

In 2002, after correction of aortic coarctation the woman was admitted to our Clinic with an incompetent proximal anastomosis and an infected aortic pseudoaneurysm. Taking into consideration the general and local septic process, repeat reconstruction of the thoracic aorta was impossible due to the risk for generalization of the infectious process and fatal complications. Therefore, the woman was subjected to extra-anatomical bypass grafting of the thoracic aorta with a synthetic graft from the ascending aorta to the infrarenal portion of the abdominal aorta in order to isolate the infection focus to be followed by removal thereof. The postoperative period turned out uneventful, with no complications. After 15 years, the woman was examined again, with her condition being stable. The findings of contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated complete patency of the extra-anatomical bypass graft. The carotid-subclavian anastomosis functioned well, without narrowed portions. No infectious complications after the carried out operations were observed. Using extra-anatomical bypass grafting with exclusion from circulation and removal of the infected portion of the aorta along with the graft is one of reliable variants of treatment for such a severe complication as an infected false aneurysm.",[Hibrid surgical treatment of an aortic arch aneurysm].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30994623,Angiologiia i sosudistaia khirurgiia = Angiology and vascular surgery,2019 04 17,"Presented in the article is a clinical case report regarding hybrid surgical management of a saccular aneurysm of the aortic arch: simultaneous right-left-carotid-left-subclavian bypass grafting and endovascular isolation of the aneurysm.

The postoperative period proved uneventful, with as rapid rehabilitation as possible. From our own experience, with this one being not the first similar operation performed in the Centre, it may be supposed that carrying out simultaneous hybrid interventions in treatment of aneurysms of the aortic arch with the use of different variants of switching its branches may decrease the frequency of postoperative complications for patients of high surgical risk, reduce the length of hospital stay and, consequently, economic expenditures for treatment.",[Functionality of mammary-coronary bypass grafts according to the data of intraoperative flowmetry].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30994622,Angiologiia i sosudistaia khirurgiia = Angiology and vascular surgery,2019 04 17,"Improvement of surgical treatment for ischaemic heart disease is one of the main trends in modern medicine. After the operation of coronary bypass grafting, further functioning of blood flow in the grafts largely depends upon its domination over the native blood flow in the target coronary arteries. Therefore, intraoperative diagnosis of functional competence of coronary bypass grafts by means of flowmetry is currently of special importance. The purpose of this study was flowmetric quantitative assessment of the curves of blood flow through the coronary bypass grafts, depending on the degree of stenosis of the target coronary arteries. A total of 135 patients were examined during our study. We evaluated the curves of blood flow through the bypass grafts from the left internal thoracic artery to the anterior descending artery. The bypass grafts were divided into three groups: the 1st group (n=47) with moderate stenosis of the coronary arteries (from 50 to 75%); the 2nd group (n=42) with a more pronounced lesion of the target vessel (from 75 to 99%), and the 3rd group (n = 46) with occluded coronary arteries (100%). It was revealed that the flow rate (Q, ml/min) in group one was lower (17±3.1) than in group two (33±5.3) and group three (45±3.4). Also, differences were revealed in the resistance index of the grafts: it turned out to be higher in group one (5.2±1.1) and group two (4.5±0.9) as compared with group three (1.8±0.5). However, there was no between-group difference in diastolic filling of the grafts, which amounted to 58±13, 61±10 and 64±9% for groups one, two and three, respectively. By the shape of the curve, we assessed the reverse systolic peak whose presence prevailed in the grafts of group one (15 of 47; 31.9%) and group two (11 of 42; 26.2%) as compared with that in the grafts of group three (5 of 46; 10.8%).

The study included a total of 104 patients presenting with coronary artery disease and the ejection fraction below 30%, who over the period from 2009 to 2016 underwent coronary artery bypass grafting with the use of autovenous and autoarterial conduits. 77 patients endured plasty of an aneurysm of the left ventricle (LV), 89 patients sustained plasty of the valvular apparatus. All patients were subjected to control coronary bypass angiography (CBA) within 12 postoperative months. Thus, we analysed a total of 184 autoarterial and 84 autovenous shunts. The findings of CBA revealed occlusions of 2 (1%) arterial and 10 (11%) venous conduits. Analysing the coronary bypass angiographies of the patients ranked according to the values of the effective stroke volume index demonstrated the following regularity: a decrease in the LV effective stroke volume index of less than 30 ml/m2 was accompanied bу increased incidence of thrombosis of autovenous shunts in the immediate postoperative period. Predictors of early occlusion of coronary bypass grafts were revealed by means of the Cox regression analysis. It was determined that using an autovein increased the risk of occlusion of the shunt by 26%, a decrease in the effective stroke volume index of the left ventricle by 1 ml/m2 increased the risk of early occlusion of coronary bypass grafts by 18%, a decrease in the diameter of the shunted artery by 0.5 mm increased the risk for early occlusion of the shunt by 12%, a decrease in the blood flow velocity (Qmean) by 1 ml/m2 increased the risk for occlusion of the shunt by 10%, a decrease in the peripheral resistance index (RI) by 1 unit elevated the risk of early occlusion of the bypass graft by 12%. Analysing the revealed independent predictors with the help of the neural network method demonstrated that the strongest influence on early incompetence of the coronary bypass graft was exerted by the type of the conduit and effective stroke index.","[Bleedings after reconstructive operations on the aorta, its branches, and peripheral arteries (on materials of the Department of Vascular Surgery A.N.

A total of 3,787 operations on the aorta and arteries had been performed over that time period. Bleedings were observed in 170 cases (4.5% of all interventions), with the mortality rate amounting to 25.3%. Of these, 72 bleedings (42.3%) were primary, to have developed from anastomoses or sutures of the artery, with 38 (22.3%) being secondary (arrosive) and 10 (5.9%) related to hypocoagulation. In the remaining 50 (29.4%) episodes, the blood had leaked from tissues (en masse). Of these, no source of bleeding had been identified in 8 (4.7%) cases. The subjects of investigation were the terms of bleeding onset, localization, causes, dependence from suture material. The authors suggested a tentative classification of postoperative bleeding. It was determined that 50.6% of these events had developed within the first 24 postoperative hours. Primary bleedings were found to have more often occurred from sutures of the thoracic aorta (58.3%) and arrosive ones from the femoral artery (60%). The causes of primary bleedings were determined to be as follows: cuts of the vascular wall by suture material (66.7%) or needle entry holes (15%), defects between sutures of an anastomosis (14%), defects of an autovein in the area of an anastomosis (2.8%), separation of fibers of the graft in the area of an anastomosis (1.4%).

Recent trends are towards increased use of topical haemostatic agents. Tachocomb has been used for more than 30 years in abdominal surgery and oncology. The purpose of the present publication is to analyse the literature data and formulate the indications for the use of Tachocomb in cardiovascular surgery. Multicenter randomized and local studies have demonstrated efficacy of Tachocomb in treatment of surgical haemorrhage in operations on the heart, thoracic aorta, carotid arteries and lower-limb arteries, resulting in significantly decreased time to achieve haemostasis, decreased volume of blood loss and haemotrasfusion, as well as reduced frequency of complications. Also shown was economic efficacy, including a shortened length of patients' hospital stay. This is followed by describing a wide spectrum of examples of alternative use of Tachocomb, including its use for seamless closure of defects of cardiac chamber walls, aero- and lymphostasis, prevention of formation of commissures.

The endovascular method of treatment of patients with descending aortic dissection has been recognized to be revolutionary. However, there seems to be no commonly accepted concept concerning appropriate use of currently available techniques of treating patients with DA dissection. This study was aimed at analysing the experience gained in using various methods of treatment of patients with descending aortic dissection (DAD). We retrospectively examined the results of surgical treatment of 78 patients with DAD. Of these, 45 patients were found to have Stanford type B dissection and 33 patients had type A dissection, who underwent treatment during ten years from January 2008. The decision concerning the type of care for patients with DAD (conservative, surgical, endovascular or combined methods of treatment) directly depends on the patient's state stability, technical feasibility of the intended procedure, and the presence of concomitant pathology. The findings obtained in our study demonstrated better immediate outcomes of the endovascular approach compared with the hybrid and surgical ones. In order to achieve complete haemodynamic correction of the pathology, to minimize the risk of aortic remodelling and the development of aorta-related complications, the treatment should not be limited to endoprosthetic repair of the thoracic portion of the DA with a stent graft, but should rather be supplemented with stenting of more distal segments, including with uncoated stents at the level of the visceral branches. Only such staged approach may provide better conditions for obliteration of the aortic false lumen and formation of a 'neo-frame' of the aortic wall.",[Some comments on the 2017 European Guidelines on treatment of atherosclerotic lesions of brachiocephalic arteries].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30994616,Angiologiia i sosudistaia khirurgiia = Angiology and vascular surgery,2019 04 17,Analysed herein are the indications for primary interventions in patients with atherosclerotic lesions of internal carotid arteries according to the recommendations laid down in the 2017 Guidelines of the European Society for Vascular Surgery.,[In-hospital outcomes of transcutaneous coronary intervention and carotid endarterectomy in hybrid and staged regimens].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30994615,Angiologiia i sosudistaia khirurgiia = Angiology and vascular surgery,2019 04 17,"The aim of this study was comparative assessment of in-hospital outcomes after hybrid and staged surgical management of patients presenting with haemodynamically significant lesions of the coronary (CA) and brachiocephalic arteries (BCA) treated by means of either endovascular or surgical techniques. Over the period from 2010 to 2017, we operated on a total of 197 patients with stenotic lesions of the carotid and coronary arteries. The strategy of revascularization included transcutaneous coronary intervention (TCI) and carotid endarterectomy (CEA). Of these, 73 (37%) patients underwent staged revascularization of the brain and myocardium in various sequence (TCI-CEA or CEA-TCI), with a mean interval between the operations amounting to 9.89±7.36 months. Unfavourable outcomes were regarded as the development of such significant cardiovascular events as myocardial infarction (MI), acute impairment of cerebral circulation, death, repeat unplanned revascularization. For hybrid strategy (TCI+CEA) the index period of assessing the outcomes was the single in-hospital period, whereas for the staged strategy it was the time period beginning from the in-hospital period of the primary operation and ending by the in-hospital period of the second stage. The groups were comparable by the absolute majority of the parameters. More than half of the patients were elderly males. One third had a history of MI. The findings of coronary angiography most often revealed lesions of 1-2 CAs. The average parameters of carotid artery stenosis, according to the BCA angiography varied from 74.9 to 82.6%, with bilateral occlusive stenotic lesions being revealed in every third patient. In connection with more frequent involvement of 1-2 CAs the patients underwent implantation of 1-2 stents. In our sample we used a total of 247 stents. Of these, 119 were uncoated and 128 were drug-eluting stents. No between-group significant differences in the development of unfavourable cardiovascular events during the in-hospital postoperative period were revealed. However, despite this, a pronounced negative tendency of the complication rate was noted in the group of staged revascularization. Non-optimal time intervals between the stages of the operations in a third of cases exceeded one year on the patient's own initiative. Nearly a quarter of patients did not come for the second stage of revascularization. An important finding of our study was no increase in the risk of stent thrombosis in hybrid operations compared with the staged approach, despite administration of a loading dose of clopidogrel after CEA, but not before TCI. Another significant result was the fact of greater availability of revascularization of the myocardium and the brain within the framework of the hybrid strategy as compared with the staged one, which may play an important role in prevention of ischaemic unfavourable events in the remote period of follow up."

The causes of delayed colonization of such grafts by endotheliocytes and mesenchymal stem cells have not been adequately investigated. The authors examined the effect of polyethylene terephthalate on the functional activity of human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells and endothelial progenitor cells in vitro. Proliferation (MTT assay, real-time cellular impedance), migration (Boyden chamber, real-time cellular impedance), and nitric oxide production (spectrophotometciacally) by progenitor endothelial cells and mesenchymal stem cells were assessed with and without the presence of polyethylene terephthalate. The functional activity of the cells was shown to depend on the presence of polyethylene terephthalate in a well with cells. Thus, polyethylene terephthalate turned out to exhibit a toxic effect on progenitor endothelial and mesenchymal stem cells.

They deteriorate the course of the underlying disease and are frequent causes of death. The oncological patient is at high risk of not only thrombosis but haemorrhage during anticoagulant therapy. Recent randomized clinical trials have positively appreciated the possibilities of direct oral anticoagulants in treatment and prevention of thromboses in oncological patients. Analysing subgroups in these studies demonstrated that direct oral anticoagulants during long-term administration were at least as effective and safe as vitamin K antagonists. The most significant by the number of cases, duration of therapy, and methodology of analysis are the reports regarding rivaroxaban - an oral, direct factor Xa inhibitor. There are also findings obtained in a separate randomized study, confirming efficacy and safety of rivaroxaban in treatment of patients with cancer-associated venous thromboembolic complications as compared with therapy with low-molecular-weight heparins.

There has not been a case series devoted to describing its detailed clinicopathologic and immunohistochemical characteristics. Six sarcomas harboring EWSR1-NFATC2 fusion transcripts by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and amplification of the fusion gene by fluorescence in situ hybridization were identified. The patients were 5 adult men and 1 adult woman. Three were primary bone tumors of the radius and 3 were primary soft tissue tumors. Most tumors showed monomorphic round to epithelioid cells in anastomosing cords and abundant myxohyaline to collagenous extracellular matrix. Two tumors had large areas of a solid, matrix-poor histomorphology. All tumors stained for CD99 and NKX2.2; while EMA, dot-like cytokeratin, and focal WT-1 and SMA were present in some tumors. All but 1 tumor showed poor histologic and radiologic responses to neoadjuvant ES-specific chemotherapy. Local or distant recurrences happened in 4 cases. EWSR1-NFATC2 sarcoma is a novel translocation-associated sarcoma. It presents as either a primary bone or soft tissue tumor, usually exhibits distinctive histopathologic features, and has predilection for long bones of adult men. It consistently shows recurrent fusion gene amplification readily detectable by EWSR1 breakapart fluorescence in situ hybridization, which serves as a diagnostic surrogate. It has potential for local and distant recurrence and histologic progression, and is resistant to Ewing sarcoma-specific chemotherapy.",Diagnostic Significance of HRAS Mutations in Epithelial-Myoepithelial Carcinomas Exhibiting a Broad Histopathologic Spectrum.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30994537,The American journal of surgical pathology,2019 06 12,"Epithelial-myoepithelial carcinoma (EMC) is a rare salivary gland tumor that is histologically characterized by biphasic tubular structures composed of inner ductal and outer clear myoepithelial cells. Because of its histologic variety, it is sometimes challenging to make an accurate diagnosis, and useful ancillary tests are essential for this purpose. We investigated 87 cases of EMC arising in the major and minor salivary glands and seromucinous glands in the nasal cavity or bronchus to describe the histologic features and mutation status of selected key oncogenes. Classic EMC accounted for 40.2% of all cases. Other cases showed various growth patterns and cytologic features in addition to the typical histology; cribriform patterns, a basaloid appearance, and sebaceous differentiation were relatively common (17.2% to 18.4%), whereas oncocytic/apocrine, papillary-cystic, double-clear, squamous, psammomatous, Verocay-like, and high-grade transformation were rare. HRAS mutations were found in 82.7% of EMCs and were concentrated in codon 61. There was no significant correlation between the HRAS mutation status and the histology. No EMC ex pleomorphic adenoma cases had HRAS mutations. PIK3CA and/or AKT1 mutations were the second most frequent mutations (20.7%, 6.5%, respectively) and almost always cooccurred with HRAS mutations. It is noteworthy that the HRAS mutation was not identified in any salivary gland tumor entities manifesting EMC-like features, including adenoid cystic carcinoma, pleomorphic adenoma, basal cell adenoma/adenocarcinoma, and myoepithelial carcinoma. We conclude that HRAS mutations are a frequent tumorigenic gene alteration in EMC, despite its histologic diversity.

No patient experienced adverse events related to bradycardia. Resolution of bradycardia at outpatient follow-up occurred in 62 of 71 (87%). Examination of nadir heart rate during subsequent hospitalizations in which steroids were not being administered did not demonstrate a significant incidence of bradycardia. Corticosteroid-induced bradycardia is common in children with ALL receiving induction chemotherapy. It was not associated with clinical adverse events and self-resolved without intervention. Therefore, further cardiac assessment may not be warranted in the presence of asymptomatic bradycardia suspected to be secondary to steroid administration."

Preventive control efforts have been implemented worldwide aimed at reducing its impact on human health. The recent reduction of chemicals available for vector control due to their negative impact on the environment and human health and the increase in mosquito resistance to insecticides have driven the research community to identify and evaluate sustainable alternatives to synthetic insecticides. In this study, the potential larvicidal effect of essential oils extracted from Ocimum campechianum, Ocotea quixos and Piper aduncum were tested in vitro. GC and GC-MS analyses showed that the main compounds were eugenol (18%), 1,8-cineole (39%) and dillapiole (48%), respectively. Susceptibility to essential oils was measured according to the WHO protocol. After 24 h, the mean percentage mortality ranged from 2.7 to 100% for P. aduncum, from 2.2 to 100% for O. campechianum, and from 2.9 to 100% for O. quixos.

Neuraminidase (NA) is a surface protein capable of cleaving the glycosidic linkages of neuraminic acids to release newly formed virions from infected cells. Genetic variants within a viral population can influence the emergence of pandemic viruses as well as drug susceptibility and vaccine effectiveness. In the present study, 55 clinical specimens from patients infected with the 2009 pandemic influenza A/H1N1 virus, abbreviated as A(H1N1)pdm09, during the 2015-2016 outbreak season in Taiwan were collected. Whole genomes were obtained through next-generation sequencing. Based on the published sequences from A(H1N1)pdm09 strains worldwide, a mixed population of two distinct variants at NA position 151 was revealed. We initially reasoned that such a mixed population may have emerged during cell culture. However, additional investigations confirmed that these mixed variants were detectable in the specimens of patients. To further investigate the role of the two NA-151 variants in a dynamic population, a reverse genetics system was employed to generate recombinant A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses. It was observed that the mixture of the two distinct variants was characterized by a higher replication rate compared to the recombinant viruses harbouring a single variant. Moreover, an NA inhibition assay revealed that a high frequency of the minor NA-151 variant in A(H1N1)pdm09 was associated with a reduced susceptibility to NA inhibitors. We conclude that two distinct NA-151 variants can be identified in patient specimens and that such variants may increase viral replication and NA activity.","Molecular detection of Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum in 150-year-old foetal remains, southeastern France.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30994442,Journal of medical microbiology,2019 05 14,"Syphilis, caused by Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum , is considered as an old disease affecting humans; traces of such infections, including congenital syphilis, are potentially identifiable in archaeological samples.

These systems are called phasevarions, for phase-variable regulons. Phasevarions regulate genes involved in pathogenesis, host adaptation and antibiotic resistance. Many human-adapted bacterial pathogens contain phasevarions. These include leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide, such as non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Neisseria spp. Phase-variable methyltransferases and phasevarions have also been discovered in environmental organisms and veterinary pathogens. The existence of many different examples suggests that phasevarions have evolved multiple times as a contingency strategy in the bacterial domain, controlling phenotypes that are important in adapting to environmental change. Many of the organisms that contain phasevarions have existing or emerging drug resistance. Vaccines may therefore represent the best and most cost-effective tool to prevent disease caused by these organisms. However, many phasevarions also control the expression of current and putative vaccine candidates; variable expression of antigens could lead to immune evasion, meaning that vaccines designed using these targets become ineffective. It is therefore essential to characterize phasevarions in order to determine an organism's stably expressed antigenic repertoire, and rationally design broadly effective vaccines.","Outcome of a screening program for the prevention of neonatal early-onset group B Streptococcus infection: a population-based cohort study in Inner Mongolia, China.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30994439,Journal of medical microbiology,2019 05 14,Invasive early-onset group B Streptococcus infection (EOGBS) is an important cause of severe neonatal complications but study on comprehensive GBS screening is lacking in China.

In this work three different casing materials, blonde peat, black peat and a 50 : 50 mixture of both, were compared for their capacity to show a natural suppressive response against dry bubble, Lecanicillium fungicola (Preuss) Zare and Gams, and wet bubble, Mycogone perniciosa (Magnus) Delacroix. The highest mushroom production was collected from crops cultivated using the mixed casing and black peat, which were not significantly different in yield. However, artificial infection with mycoparasites resulted in similar yield losses irrespective of the material used, indicating that the casing materials do not confer advantages in disease suppression. The composition of the microbiome of the 50 : 50 casing mixture along the crop cycle and the compost and basidiomes was evaluated through next-generation sequencing (NGS) of the V3-V4 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene and the fungal ITS2 region. Once colonized by Agaricus bisporus, the bacterial diversity of the casing microbiome increased and the fungal diversity drastically decreased. From then on, the composition of the casing microbiome remained relatively stable. Analysis of the composition of the bacterial microbiome in basidiomes indicated that it is highly influenced by the casing microbiota. Notably, L. fungicola was consistently detected in uninoculated control samples of compost and casing using NGS, even in asymptomatic crops. This suggests that the naturally established casing microbiota was able to help to suppress disease development when inoculum levels were low, but was not effective in suppressing high pressure from artificially introduced fungal inoculum. Determination of the composition of the casing microbiome paves the way for the development of synthetic casing communities that can be used to investigate the role of specific components of the casing microbiota in mushroom production and disease control.","Limnobaculum parvum gen. nov., sp. nov., isolated from a freshwater lake.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30994436,International journal of systematic and evolutionary microbiology,2019 06 06,"A Gram-stain-negative, rod-shaped, facultatively anaerobic bacterium, designated as strain HYN0051T, was isolated from lake water. 16S rRNA gene sequence analyses indicated that the isolate shares the highest sequence similarity with the genus Pragia (97.1 %) of the family Enterobacteriaceae. Strain HYN0051T did not form a rigid clade with the genus Pragia in any of the phylogenetic trees, demonstrating the novel generic status of the isolate. The genome of strain HYN0051T (CP029185) is a single circular chromosome of 3.84 Mb. The major fatty acids detected were C14 : 0, C16 : 0, summed feature 2 (C12 : 0 aldehyde and/or unknown 10.928), summed feature 3 (C16 : 1ω6c and/or C16 : 1ω7c) and summed feature 8 (C18 : 1ω6c and/or C18 : 1ω7c).

Introduction:

Early diagnosis and prompt therapy of diabetic retinopathy (DR) are essential to prevent visual loss, but access of the diabetic population to regular fundus examination by an ophthalmologist remains a challenge.

Methods:

This prospective comparative study, including two referral health centers in the state of Minas Gerais, Southeastern Brazil, assesses applicability and economic viability of fundus photography-based teleophthalmology screening for DR.

Results:

A total of 2,662 eyes of 1,331 patients were examined at both health centers. Mean age was 57 years, with 836 (62.8%) females. Quality of fundus photographs was acceptable for 2,398 eyes (90.1%). The presence of DR was disclosed in 394 patients (29.6%), with 28 patients (2.1%) presenting evidence of advanced disease (severe nonproliferative or proliferative DR). Economic assessment revealed cost reduction of 28.76 US$ per patient, with a calculated break-even point of 112 exams/month or 1,344 exams/year.

Conclusions:

For the situation studied under the perspective of public health service, teleophthalmology was viable and cost effective when compared with ordinary ophthalmology examination. In addition, teleophthalmology allowed rapid resolution of repressed demand for fundus examination of diabetic patients locally at the two sites, with early DR diagnoses and referrals. Fundus photography-based teleophthalmology was a viable, effective, and significantly cheaper strategy for the screening of DR.

Background:
Healthy rate of weight loss (RWL) is defined as 1-2 lb of body weight loss per week.
Objective:
The objective of this study is to investigate changes in adherence to remote monitoring devices and RWL per week in response to a fully online, 12-week, medically monitored, weight management program incorporating weekly video-based health coaching (intervention group [INT]) versus self-guided (control group [CON]).
Methods:
Twenty-five obese participants (12 males, 13 females) were randomly assigned to either an INT (n = 13, 106.8 ± 25.46 kg, body mass index [BMI] = 35.19 ± 3.91 kg/m2) or CON group (n = 12, 99.8 ± 19.14 kg, BMI = 34.86 ± 4.43 kg/m2). Program related content was derived from inHealth Medical Services, Inc., Telehealth Enabled Approach to Multidisciplinary care (TEAM™) curriculum. All participants were given two wireless devices (Activity Pop and Body Scale; Withings®, Cambridge, MA) that connected them directly with the research team. The INT group connected via telehealth videoconferencing weekly for health coaching with the registered dietitian and monthly for medical monitoring with the physician, while the CON group did not. Both groups connected with the physician and registered dietitian at baseline to establish clinical goals and at the end to review progress. To analyze the data, independent samples t-tests and χ2 tests were performed via SPSS v24 with data displayed as average ± SD; significance set to p < 0.05.
Results:
The INT group had increased device adherence when compared with CON (92% ± 10% vs. 75% ± 15% scale [p < 0.05]) and (80% ± 14% vs. 49% ± 15% tracker [p < 0.05]). Furthermore, RWL per week was greater in the INT when compared with CON; -0.74 ± 1.8 kg versus 0.18 ± 1.8 kg per week, respectively (p < 0.05).

Weekly health coaching via telehealth can be an effective tool to increase remote device adherence and may help to induce a healthy RWL.",Telehealth Intervention Programs for Seniors: An Observational Study of a Community-Embedded Health Monitoring Initiative.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30994409,Telemedicine journal and e-health : the official journal of the American Telemedicine Association,2019 04 17,"
Background:
Chronic disease in older adults is estimated to account for 84% of annual health care spending in the United States, with many preventable costs expected to rise as the population continues to age.
Introduction:
Telehealth Intervention Programs for Seniors (TIPS) is a community-embedded program targeting low-income older adults, providing weekly assessment of vital signs and subjective wellness, and wrap-around aging services.
Materials and Methods:
TIPS recruited 765 volunteers over 55 years, who were Medicaid and/or Medicare eligible. Data were collected from 2014 to 2016 [median enrollment 343 days (105-435)] using 12 TIPS sites. This observational study evaluated the efficacy of TIPS by measuring within-subject changes in self-reported hospital visits and <30-day readmissions, before and during TIPS participation. Data of 617 participants (median age 74.3; interquartile range 16) were analyzed.
Results:
Self-reported hospital visits were reduced by 28.9% (p = 0.0013). Medicare participants benefited the most, with a 50% (p < 0.0001) reduction in hospital visits, and a 75.5% (p = 0.017) reduction in <30-day readmissions. Multivariate analysis revealed that participants (1) Medicaid-registered (odds ratio [OR] = 2.72, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.392-1.611), (2) reporting feeling unwell (OR = 1.33, 95% CI 0.118-0.459), and (3) living alone (OR = 2.34, 95% CI 0.115-1.592) were significantly more likely than other participants to experience a hospital visit.
Discussion:
TIPS demonstrates that community-embedded health services can reduce rates of hospital visits in older adults.
Conclusion:
The success of TIPS highlights the potential of successfully deployed remote patient-monitoring initiatives in reducing the utilization of costly health services.",Optimization of Teleconsultation Using Discrete-Event Simulation from a Data-Driven Perspective.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30994407,Telemedicine journal and e-health : the official journal of the American Telemedicine Association,2019 04 17,"

Background:

Teleconsultation plays an increasingly important role to solve the health care problem in rural areas around the world. Teleconsultation resource optimization has become a new research topic.

Materials and Methods:

Given the complex teleconsultation process was difficult to be described by mathematical methods, a queuing simulation model was developed based on the data and teleconsultation empirical flow of Henan Telemedicine Center of China (HTCC) and we used kernel density estimation to solve the problem of arrival rate and service rate of teleconsultation. The data obtained from HTCC included 21,295 teleconsultation records over a 1-year period (February 27, 2016-March 25, 2017).

Results:

The average waiting time (WT) that primary hospitals requested for teleconsultation was obtained by simulation and compared with empirical average WT to verify this model. We found that Department of Internal Medicine (DIM) WT was the highest and we searched the optimized combination of teleconsultation rooms and DIM experts by sensitivity analyses.

Conclusions:

The existing resource allocation was not optimal and the hospital managers can improve it to reduce the hospitals' operating costs and the patients' waiting costs. We suggested that the teleconsultation rooms needed at least four and the DIM experts could increase from three to four.
",Characterization of natural polymers as functional barriers for cellulose-based packaging materials.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30994406,"Food additives & contaminants. Part A, Chemistry, analysis, control, exposure & risk assessment",2019 06 13,"Cellulose-based packaging materials are currently the most commonly used food packaging materials due to their light weight, stability and affordable price. However, the use of recycled paper and board adds to the risk that undesirable substances migrate into the packed goods, since contaminants are not completely removed during the recycling process and can accumulate in the final product. The only available fast and practical solution that can be used to reduce the migration of these substances is the application of functional barriers in the packaging. The applied barriers are currently mostly synthetic, which either serve only a moderate barrier function and/or have the disadvantage that it is often more complex and expensive to recycle the resulting packaging material. The aim of this project is to evaluate different bio-based or biodegradable polymers with regards to their barrier properties. Due to the fact that the transport phenomena are mainly driven by (gas phase) migration, methods based on gas chromatography (GC), including GC coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and flame ionization detection (GC-FID), GC-FID coupled online with high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC-GC-FID), and comprehensive GCxGC-MS were used to qualify and quantify the migrated substances. This use of a wide range of different methods and instruments yielded excellent results, allowing us to comprehensively characterize the biopolymers and their barrier function."

Although the role meaning plays in stroke family caregiving has been recognized, knowledge about this subject among the Chinese population is fragmented and sparse. Therefore, a hermeneutic phenomenological study was conducted as a first step in a program of research focused on Chinese caregivers utilizing a purposive sample of five stroke family caregivers living in China to explore the meaning of the lived caregiving experience. Data were collected through in-depth interviews and analyzed by a phenomenological hermeneutic interpretation. Meaning in stroke family caregiving was interpreted as suffering, an obligation, a personal choice, a meaningful opportunity, and a natural part of living. These meanings were dynamic and interconnected and were affected deeply by the Chinese culture in how caregivers experience, interpret, and cope with caregiving. Findings highlight the need to understand the culture-shaped meanings in caregiving to better support family caregivers and develop culturally tailored interventions.","Efficacy and toxicity of mustargen, vincristine, procarbazine and prednisone (MOPP) for the treatment of relapsed or resistant lymphoma in cats.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30994392,Journal of feline medicine and surgery,2019 04 17,"The aims of this study were to evaluate the safety of mustargen, vincristine, procarbazine and prednisone (MOPP) chemotherapy in the treatment of relapsed or refractory feline lymphoma, and to determine the overall response rate and median remission time with this protocol.",User-defined information sharing for team situation awareness and teamwork.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30994390,Ergonomics,2019 05 07,"Team members have different roles in various scenarios to maintain situation awareness. A collaborative system should therefore provide appropriate information to the appropriate person at an appropriate time. Considering the mismatch between the designed and actually used information, this paper proposed that users should define what information to share with their team-mates. Thirty-six participants, who formed eighteen teams, used both the traditional and user-defined shared displays to perform failure diagnosis on the context of nuclear power plants. The user-defined shared display exhibited shorter diagnosis time without significant difference in correctness. Information quality, instead of quantity, was positively correlated with team mutual awareness. This study provides empirical evidence that user-defined information sharing is effective at improving operator's diagnosis performance, so the users should be able to tailor the information based on requirements.Practitioner Summary: To support team situation awareness and teamwork, the present study proposed that users should define what information to share with their team-mates. The laboratory experiment shows that user-defined information sharing shortens operator diagnosis time without degrading correctness. Information quality appears more important than information quantity in enhancing team mutual awareness.",Combined Modality Management of Sinonasal Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase-Positive Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma in a Young Adult-Report of a Rare Case.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30994389,Journal of adolescent and young adult oncology,2019 04 17,"Sinonasal anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) without nodal involvement is extremely rare and the rarity of this tumor often leads to diagnostic dilemma. It has been predominantly reported in pediatric, adolescent and young adult patients, mostly of Asian origin. A 21-year-old female patient presented with history of epistaxis for 1 year. On clinical and radiological examination, there was a 5 cm mass in the right nasal cavity, ethmoid, and frontal sinus. Biopsy at a local center had shown moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. Rebiopsy at our center showed possibility of a hematolymphoid malignancy(pancytokeratin-, CD45+, CD3-, CD20-) and further immunohistochemistry studies(CD4+, CD43+, CD30+, ALK+) revealed ALK-positive ALCL. Rest of the lymphoma work-up was essentially normal and she had stage IE disease. She was treated with a combination of four cycles of cyclophosphamide, hydroxydaunorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone (CHOP) regimen followed by local radiotherapy (36 Gray/20 fractions/4 weeks) by three-dimensional conformal technique. She tolerated the treatment well without any severe toxicity and had complete clinical and radiological response. At last follow-up visit, 40 months from the initial diagnosis, she was alive and disease free. Sinonasal ALK-positive ALCL is a rare tumor, which can be effectively treated with a combination of multiagent CHOP/CHOP-like regimen and local conformal radiotherapy.",A short report: parents HPV vaccine knowledge in rural South Florida.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30994388,Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics,2019 05 07,"An exploratory pilot descriptive research study was conducted in the rural counties of Hendry and Glades Florida exploring parental knowledge and hesitancy of HPV vaccination. Participants included parents/caregivers with children ages 9 to 13; using quantitative methods, we evaluated knowledge, feelings, and beliefs toward HPV vaccination including vaccination prevalence and correlates among participating parents/caregivers. Our measures included the Parental HPV Survey with a Cronbach's alpha of .96. Hesitancy-focused results revealed 26% of parents showed caution because of stigma around vaccination while attributing low levels of knowledge about HPV vaccination; 80% had a persistent belief HPV vaccination could leave their child sterile, perpetuating hesitancy. Participants with a high-school education or less (64%) and conservative religious affiliation, e.g., Baptist and Catholic (74%), did not decline HPV vaccination. Results are striking considering research indicating conservative religious views and lack of a college education leads to lower HPV vaccination rates. Numerous interventions to increase HPV vaccination have been studied including strong recommendations for increased provider communication but our data indicates increasing public education with community input and a focus on cultural norms in each specific rural community among parents and providers is needed to increase HPV vaccine knowledge and decrease HPV vaccine hesitancy.",Cannabis Use among Patients in a Rural Academic Palliative Care Clinic.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30994387,Journal of palliative medicine,2019 04 17,"
Background:
 Therapeutic cannabis is being more widely used by patients to manage multiple symptoms, but the patterns of use in the palliative care population are not well defined. 
Objective:
 The primary aim of this pilot study was to describe the use of cannabis among patients attending a palliative care clinic (PCC). 
Design:
 The study was a retrospective chart review of patients seen at four different interval points during 2017 and 2018 in an ambulatory palliative care setting. 
Setting/Subjects:
 The study was conducted at a 396-bed rural academic medical center in the PCC, where the majority of patients have oncological diseases. 
Results:
 Clinicians saw 299 unique patients during the four one-month time periods reviewed. Eighty-three patients (27%) reported use of any form of cannabis. The most common reasons for cannabis use were pain (n = 49, 59%), anorexia (n = 16, 19%), insomnia (n = 14, 17%), nausea (n = 13, 16%), anxiety (n = 8, 10%), and depression (n = 5, 6%). Twenty-six patients (31%) used cannabis for more than one symptom. Among the 83 patients using cannabis, 60 (72%) were also prescribed opioids with 32% on immediate-release only and 25% on both immediate- and extended-release opioids. These 60 patients on opioids and cannabis represent 33% of all patients prescribed opioids in this clinic. Tetrahydrocannabinol was present in 25% of the 73 urine drug screens. 
Conclusions:
 Our data show a significant minority of patients in a PCC use cannabis. Further research should focus on more detailed information about formulation use, methods of ingestion, perceived efficacy, side effects, cost, and standardization of clinical practices. Given the prevalence of cannabis use, further research into its efficacy, side effects, and safety is needed, including whether patients with prior/active substance use receive more or less benefit or harm from cannabis use.","The Many Faces of EpigeneticsOxford, December 2017.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30994386,Epigenetics,2019 05 31,"The conference 'The Many Faces of Epigenetics: Multidisciplinary Perspectives ""over"" Genetics' was held in Oxford (6-8 December 2017) and offered a valuable window into the domain of Epigenetics and its promises. The workshop revealed that, among a wealth of discourses about Epigenetics, it is not so easy to decipher which discourses are to be trusted. Because Epigenetics is a rather old notion that has generated many debates and promises, defining precisely what has changed and where we are currently is a challenge in itself. Interestingly, the conference allowed debates beyond statements such as 'If you don't know the cause, you say it's epigenetic' (Deichmann 2016), pointing out that the lack of a precise definition of Epigenetics was no hindrance to the discussions. Finally, it highlighted the grounds of (dis)agreement among communities of natural and social scientists; but eventually the discussions showed that epigenetic tools open the path to new topics and challenges that are awaiting us.",Detection by flow cytometry of anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies in a novel approach based on neutrophil extracellular traps.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30994385,Autoimmunity,2019 04 17,"Anti-neutrophil-cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) are auto-antibodies directed against components of neutrophil granulocytes and may be found in various inflammatory conditions, like small-vessel vasculitis or ulcerative colitis (UC).

Stream Processing Systems (SPSs) are designed to act on real-time streaming data using continuous queries consisting of interconnected operators. The dynamic nature of data streams, for example, fluctuation in data arrival rates and uneven data distribution, can cause an operator to be a bottleneck one. Scalability is an important factor in SPS, but detecting bottleneck operator correctly and scaling it without affecting application execution are challenging. A stateful operator such as aggregation or join makes scaling operation more difficult as it involves state management. Current research does not address the issue of scaling stateful operators efficiently as mostly stop application for handling state, which results in significant overheads to the performance. In this article, the key idea is to detect bottleneck operator correctly using the runtime bottleneck detection approach and then scale out this operator and manage its internal state in a way that we can achieve almost zero latency. During the bottleneck detection process, we have defined alarming_threshold, a parameter for the operators that can be bottleneck operators in the future and scale_out_threshold, when the operator is bottleneck. To scale out, we have presented two techniques, active backup and checkpointing, the former one will start a Secondary Execution (SE) in back end by partitioning state and input streams to multiple nodes at alarming_threshold; this SE will replace primary node at scale_out_threshold. In the latter technique, a State Manager (SM) module will start state checkpointing at alarming_threshold to external store and perform scale out by managing state and input stream at scale_out_threshold. The first approach will help us to achieve almost zero latency goal, while the latter one is a resource efficient technique. Our results show that both techniques are working while providing desired goals of reducing overall latency during scale out and improving resource utilization.","Impact of Key Workplace Breastfeeding Support Characteristics on Job Satisfaction, Breastfeeding Duration, and Exclusive Breastfeeding Among Health Care Employees.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30994382,Breastfeeding medicine : the official journal of the Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine,2019 04 17,"
Background:
 Although national breastfeeding rates have improved across recent decades, women continue to face barriers to achieving recommended breastfeeding targets. Returning to work presents a unique set of challenges for breastfeeding continuation, even in health care settings tasked with promoting breastfeeding among patients. This study examined the association between key workplace breastfeeding support characteristics, job satisfaction, and breastfeeding outcomes among health care employees. 
Materials and Methods:
 We used data from a cross-sectional survey of employees in a large integrated health care system. The study sample included female employees who had breastfed in the past 3 years (n = 165). The Employee Perceptions of Breastfeeding Support Questionnaire (EPBS-Q) measured organization, manager, and coworker support for breastfeeding. Regression analyses tested the association between workplace support factors and breastfeeding duration, breastfeeding exclusivity, and job satisfaction. 
Results:
 Managerial support increased median job satisfaction by 0.39 standard deviations (p < 0.001), and increased the odds of prolonging exclusive breastfeeding (odds ratio [OR] 1.47; confidence interval [CI] 1.03-2.09). Organizational support increased median job satisfaction by 0.27 standard deviations (p < 0.001), and increased the odds of exclusive breastfeeding by nearly twofold (OR 1.80; CI 1.05-3.09). No significant associations were found between workplace support factors (organizational, managerial, and co-worker support) and overall breastfeeding duration. 
Conclusions:
 Organizational and managerial support are key aspects of workplace lactation support, which may positively impact job satisfaction, rates of exclusive breastfeeding, and duration of exclusive breastfeeding among female health care employees. This intersection of outcomes salient for the business community and public health practitioners highlights opportunities for collaborations to improve workplace and breastfeeding outcomes."

This work contributes to the development of effective statistical methods of big data analysis for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) risk assessment to be employed in routine clinical practice. The objective of this study to be reached via machine-learning analysis is twofold: investigation of a possible application of biochemical biomarkers for the T2DM risk prediction in case of a limited knowledge of biometrical parameters of an individual, as well as study on the predictive ability of a derived parameter (rate of a biomarker change over time) in T2DM risk prediction. Obtained statistical parameters (AUC, p-value, etc.) justify a relatively high quality of the model. Nevertheless, a further improvement may be addressed through the following avenues: analysis of adding new factors and models, including lifestyle/habits, and genetic parameters.

Aim:
 The amelogenin gene is a widely used gender marker for forensic DNA profiling. Males who have the amelogenin Y (AMELY) allele deletion can be mistakenly identified as females if genotyping is performed only on the amelogenin gene. The aim of this study was to investigate the frequency of the AMELY allele deletion in the Chinese Han population and analyze the possible genetic variation on the Y chromosome. 
Materials and Methods:
 The amelogenin gene of 12,735 unrelated males from the Chinese Han population were genotyped using common forensic short tandem repeat (STR) kits. The AMELY allele deletion was verified by redesigned primers and sequencing. Eighteen Y-specific sequence tagged sites (STSs) on the Yp11.2 region were selected to delineate the deletion breakpoints on the Y chromosome. 
Results:
 Three males were confirmed to have no AMELY allele. The frequency rate of the AMELY-null allele was 0.236% (3/12,735) in the Chinese Han population of Central China; 2.73 Mb of sequence on the Y chromosome were absent in all the AMELY-negative samples. The deleted region was mapped using SRY, AMELY, 5 Y-STRs, and 18 STSs, which belong to the class I deleted pattern. The three unrelated males shared the same Y-STR haplotype with four males from other Chinese populations, all of whom have the AMELY-null allele. The haplogroup of these males was identified as the O3 haplogroup. 
Conclusion:
 The AMELY allele deletion in the Chinese population was accompanied by the deletion of the Y-STR loci on the Yp11.2 region. Therefore, another Y-specific marker should be tested simultaneously when unknown samples are examined as part of a criminal investigation.",A Comparative Study of Single-Trait and Multi-Trait Genomic Selection.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30994361,Journal of computational biology : a journal of computational molecular cell biology,2019 04 17,"
In recent years of animal and plant breeding research, genomic selection (GS) became a choice for selection of appropriate candidate for breeding as it significantly contributes to enhance the genetic gain. Various studies related to GS have been carried out in the recent past. These studies were mostly confined to single trait. Although GS methods based on single trait have not performed very well in cases like pleiotropy, missing data and when the trait under study has low heritability. Gradually, some studies were carried out to explore the possibility of methods for GS based on multiple traits in the view of overcoming the above-mentioned problems in the method of single-trait GS (STGS). Currently, multi-trait-based GS methods are getting importance as it exploits the information of correlated structure among response. In this study, we have compared various methods related to STGS, such as stepwise regression, ridge regression, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), Bayesian, best linear unbiased prediction, and support vector machine, and multi-trait-based GS methods, such as multivariate regression with covariance estimation, conditional Gaussian graphical models, mixed model, and LASSO. In almost all cases, multi-trait-based methods are found to be more accurate. Based on the results of this study, it may be concluded that multi-trait-based methods have great potential to increase genetic gain as they utilize the correlation among the response variable as extra information, which contributes to estimate breeding value more precisely. This study is a comprehensive review of the methods of GS right from single trait to multiple traits and comparisons among these two classes.

B,2019 06 11,"We explore in this work, after synthesizing and appropriately characterizing an amphiphilic diblock copolymer, its interaction with water molecules and the subsequent aqueous solution dynamics by employing time-resolved fluorescence measurements (TRF) and megahertz-gigahertz dielectric relaxation (DR) experiments. The synthesized amphiphilic diblock copolymer is poly(2-((( tert-butoxycarbonyl)alanyl)oxy)ethyl methacrylate)- b-poly(polyethylene glycol monomethyl ether methacrylate) (P(Boc-l-Ala-HEMA)- b-PPEGMA). Dynamic light scattering measurements of aqueous solutions indicate formation of 14-20 nm particles from a balance between the chain lengths of the hydrophobic (P(Boc-l-Ala-HEMA) and hydrophilic (PPEGMA) segments. Field-emission scanning electron microscopy, on the other hand, suggests a spherical shape for the dried micelles. The critical micelle concentration of the P(Boc-l-Ala-HEMA)- b-PPEGMA block copolymer at different block lengths in aqueous media, determined via steady-state fluorescence measurements, is very low (∼4-8 mg/L), and the resultant micellar size has been found to be insensitive to the polymer concentration. Interfacial and bulk aqueous dynamics have been investigated by tracking the solution frictional resistance on rotational motion of dissolved hydrophobic and hydrophilic dipolar solute probes of comparable sizes. TRF anisotropy measurements reflect the biphasic temporal profile for the frictional resistance. Interestingly, the hydrophobic probe, because of its preferential location at the micellar interface, experiences greater frictional resistance than the hydrophilic counterpart, although the latter reports stronger polymer concentration dependence of the frictional retardation than the former. DR measurements at the highest of the polymer concentrations considered suggest presence of aqueous dynamics slower than that for neat bulk water, although evidence for such ""slow"" dynamics at lower concentrations has not been detected in the present DR measurements.",Visible-Light-Promoted [5 + 1] Annulation Initiated by Electron-Donor-Acceptor Complexes: Synthesis of Perfluoroalkyl- s-Triazines.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30994359,Organic letters,2019 06 13,"A visible-light-promoted electron-donor-acceptor (EDA) complex-initiated [5 + 1] annulation between biguanides and perfluoroalkyl halides for the construction of perfluoroalkyl- s-triazines has been developed.

We demonstrate here that yeast is a valid system for engineering and reconstituting the abietane diterpene network, allowing for the discovery of novel compounds with potential bioactivity.","Membrane-Permeant, Environment-Sensitive Dyes Generate Biosensors within Living Cells.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30994345,Journal of the American Chemical Society,2019 05 08,"Dyes with environment-sensitive fluorescence have proven useful to study the spatiotemporal dynamics of protein activity in living cells. When attached to proteins, their fluorescence can reflect protein conformational changes, post-translational modifications, or protein interactions. However, the utility of such dye-protein conjugates has been limited because it is difficult to load them into cells. They usually must be introduced using techniques that perturb cell physiology, limit throughput, or generate fluorescent vesicles (e.g., electroporation, microinjection, or membrane transduction peptides). Here we circumvent these problems by modifying a proven, environment-sensitive biosensor fluorophore so that it can pass through cell membranes without staining intracellular compartments and can be attached to proteins within living cells using unnatural amino acid (UAA) mutagenesis. Reactive groups were incorporated for attachment to UAAs or small molecules (mero166, azide; mero167, alkyne; mero76, carboxylic acid). These dyes are bright and fluoresce at long wavelengths (reaching ε = 100 000 M-1 cm-1, ϕ = 0.24, with excitation 565 nm and emission 594 nm). The utility of mero166 was demonstrated by in-cell labeling of a UAA to generate a biosensor for the small GTPase Cdc42. In addition, conjugation of mero166 to a small molecule produced a membrane-permeable probe that reported the localization of the DNA methyltransferase G9a in cells. This approach provides a strategy to access biosensors for many targets and to more practically harness the varied environmental sensitivities of synthetic dyes.",Chemical Composition of Commercial Cow's Milk.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30994344,Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,2019 05 01,"Bovine milk is a nutritionally rich, chemically complex biofluid consisting of hundreds of different components. While the chemical composition of cow's milk has been studied for decades, much of this information is fragmentary and very dated. In an effort to consolidate and update this information, we have applied modern, quantitative metabolomics techniques along with computer-aided literature mining to obtain the most comprehensive and up-to-date characterization of the chemical constituents in commercial cow's milk. Using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), and inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), we were able to identify and quantify 296 bovine milk metabolites or metabolite species (corresponding to 1447 unique structures) from a variety of commercial milk samples. Through our literature analysis, we also found another 676 metabolites or metabolite species (corresponding to 908 unique structures). Detailed information regarding all 2355 of the identified chemicals in bovine milk have been made freely available through a Web-accessible database called the Milk Composition Database or MCDB ( http://www.mcdb.ca/ ).",Biodegrading Two Pesticide Residues in Paddy Plants and the Environment by a Genetically Engineered Approach.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30994343,Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,2019 05 01,"Accumulating pesticide (and herbicide) residues in soils have become a serious environmental problem. This study focused on identifying the removal of two widely used pesticides, isoproturon (IPU) and acetochlor (ACT), by a genetically developed paddy (or rice) plant overexpressing an uncharacterized glycosyltransferase (IRGT1). IRGT1 conferred plant resistance to isoproturon-acetochlor, which was manifested by attenuated cellular injury and alleviated toxicity of rice under isoproturon-acetochlor stress. A short-term study showed that IRGT1-transformed lines removed 33.3-48.3% of isoproturon and 39.8-53.5% of acetochlor from the growth medium, with only 59.5-72.1 and 58.9-70.4% of the isoproturon and acetochlor remaining in the plants compared with the levels in untransformed rice. This phenotype was confirmed by IRGT1-expression in yeast ( Pichia pastoris) which grew better and contained less isoproturon-acetochlor than the control cells. A long-term study showed that isoproturon-acetochlor concentrations at all developmental stages were significantly lower in the transformed rice, which contain only 59.3-69.2% (isoproturon) and 51.7-57.4% (acetochlor) of the levels in wild type. In contrast, UPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS analysis revealed that more isoproturon-acetochlor metabolites were detected in the transformed rice. Sixteen metabolites of isoproturon and 19 metabolites of acetochlor were characterized in rice for Phase I reactions, and 9 isoproturon and 13 acetochlor conjugates were characterized for Phase II reactions in rice; of these, 7 isoproturon and 6 acetochlor metabolites and conjugates were reported in plants for the first time.","Synthesis, Crystal Structure Analysis, and Electrochemical Properties of Rock-Salt Type Mg xNi yCo zO2 as a Cathode Material for Mg Rechargeable Batteries.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30994342,Inorganic chemistry,2019 05 08,"Research has recently been focused on high-performance next-generation batteries to replace secondary batteries due to capacity limitations and safety concerns. The Mg secondary battery is one candidate to realize high energy density storage batteries for practical applications. Ni and Co typically exhibit desirable electrochemical characteristics; therefore, we have attempted to synthesize new rock-salt compositions, Mg xNi yCo zO2 ( x + y + z ≤ 2.0), as cathode materials for Mg rechargeable batteries, and investigated their crystal structures and electrochemical characteristics. The materials were synthesized by the reverse coprecipitation method. Powder X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy analyses showed the obtained samples were a single phase of the rock-salt structure with the space group Fm3̅ m. The vacancies at the metal sites were estimated by Rietveld analysis to determine the new chemical composition of Mg xNi yCo z□2- x- y- zO2 (0.41 < x < 0.64, 0.82 < y < 1.23, 0.24 < z < 0.61). Charge-discharge tests indicated the discharge characteristics varied according to the Mg composition and the Ni/Co ratio. The Co and Mg compositions were considered to facilitate the insertion/deinsertion of Mg2+. The present new material has the potential to be a superior cathode material for Mg secondary batteries by first-principles calculations.",Effect of Exogenous Application of Methyl Jasmonate on the Lipid and Carbohydrate Content and Composition of Winter Triticale ( Triticosecale Wittm.) Grain and the Severity of Fungal Infections in Triticale Plants and Grain.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30994341,Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,2019 05 29,"Kernels of winter triticale ( Triticosecale Wittm. cv. Dinaro) were analyzed. In the autumn of 2015, the effect of methyl jasmonate (MJ) on the germination of triticale kernels and the development of triticale seedlings was analyzed in a laboratory before kernels were sown in experimental plots. Kernels harvested from plots in August 2016 were analyzed to determine their lipid and carbohydrate content and composition and the severity of fungal infections. Triticale grain was harvested at full maturity. The plots were sprayed with MJ at concentrations of 10-6 to 10-3 M in the stem elongation stage (200 L/ha) and in the early milk stage (300 L/ha). Other preventive treatments, fungicides, pesticides, or foliar fertilizers were not applied. Lipids of triticale kernels contained 20 fatty acids (FAs) with the highest proportion of linoleic acid. Methyl jasmonate did not exert a significant effect on the FA composition of kernel lipids treated with the plant hormone during the growing season. Statistical analysis did not reveal significant ( p < 0.05) differences in the total content of soluble carbohydrates in control kernels and in the kernels collected from triticale plants treated with MJ. Methyl jasmonate applied at a concentration of 10-3 M in BBCH stages 54 and 73 reduced the prevalence of stem base, leaf, and spike diseases. However, the severity of grain infections caused by mycotoxin-producing fungi increased in treatments where MJ was applied at a concentration of 10-5 M relative to the control treatment. The study describes the results noted in naturally infected plants and provides valuable inputs for agricultural practice, but further research is required to validate the presented findings.",Oxidation of Procyanidins with Various Degrees of Condensation: Influence on the Color-Deepening Phenomenon.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30994340,Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,2019 05 01,"Color deepening in red rice is a known phenomenon that occurs during postharvest storage. As procyanidins potentially causes this color deepening, we previously subjected synthetic procyanidin B3, a model procyanidin, to chemical oxidation and determined the structures of the products. To further elucidate the effects of various degrees of polymerization on color deepening, in this study we oxidized synthetic procyanidin C2. The intensity of the UV-vis absorption between 300 and 500 nm in the spectrum of the reaction mixture increased with increasing oxidation time. This absorption following the oxidation of procyanidin C2 was more intense than that of procyanidin B3. HPLC-ESI-MS of the oxidized reaction mixture revealed several new peaks that suggested the formation of products with new intramolecular rather than intermolecular bonds. The major product was structurally identified by comparison with the UPLC-ESI-MS/MS data for a synthetic procyanidin C2 oxide, independently prepared by condensing procyanidin B3 oxide and taxifolin.","Arsenic in Rice Bran Products: In Vitro Oral Bioaccessibility, Arsenic Transformation by Human Gut Microbiota, and Human Health Risk Assessment.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30994339,Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,2019 05 01,"Despite rice consumption, rice bran as a byproduct of rice milling contains higher arsenic (As). The present study evaluated the metabolic potency of in vitro cultured human colon microbiota toward As from five rice bran products with 0.471-1.491 mg of As/kg. Arsenic bioaccessibility ranged from 52.8 to 78.8% in the gastric phase, and a 1.2-fold increase (66.0-95.8%) was observed upon the small intestinal phase. Subsequently, a significant decline of As bioaccessibility (11.3-63.6%) and a high methylation percentage of 18.5-79.8% were found in the colon phase. The predominant As species in the solid phase was always As(V) (49.6-63.4%), and As-thiolate complexes increased by 10% at the end of colon incubation. Human gut microbiota could induce As bioaccessibility lowering and As transformation in rice bran, which illustrated the importance of food-bound As metabolism in the human body. This will result in a better understanding of health implications associated with As exposures."

So, it is highly desirable to develop facile methods to detect and recognize them. In this article, a novel fluorescent chemosensor, Phos-4, has been constructed with 1,8-naphthalimide as the fluorophore and 2-(2-aminophenyl)imidazol as the recognition sites for discrimination between phosgene and triphosgene in a dual-channel mode for the first time. Owing to the difference in electrophilicity between chlorocarbonyl and trichloromethoxycarbonyl, the sensing reaction of Phos-4 with phosgene undergoes two carbamylations to afford a cyclic product with green fluorescence, and only one carbamylation occurs for triphosgene to form a noncyclic product with blue fluorescence. The sensor Phos-4 exhibits high sensitivity (the limit of detection, 3.2 nM, for phosgene, and 1.9 nM, for triphosgene) and high selectivity in solutions. Furthermore, facile test papers containing Phos-4-embedded nanofibrous membrane have been fabricated by the electrospinning technology. The test papers can provide visual and selective detection of phosgene with a lower limit of detection (42 ppb) and a faster response (≤10 s) in the gas phase over those in solutions. The test paper with Phos-4 is promising to be a practical detection tool of gaseous phosgene.",Interference Effect of Silica Colloidal Crystal Films and Their Applications to Biosensing.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30994327,Analytical chemistry,2019 05 08,"With the aim to develop better and more reliable interference effective substrates, silica colloidal crystal films with different sphere diameters and film thicknesses were successfully made by an improved vertical deposition method and a systematic investigation of their reflectometric interference spectroscopy (RIfS) properties are presented in this work. The influence of silica sphere diameter and film thickness on the RIfS signals was studied. The results showed that the film thickness is the key factor of RIfS signals. An RIfS system was set up by using a silica colloidal crystal film as an interference effective substrate. The influence of film thickness on the response to refractive index changes of the proposed system was also investigated. When the influence of film thickness on RIfS signals and refractive index response we considered together, silica colloidal crystal films with a thickness between 4 and 6 μm were chosen for sensor construction. Monitoring the digestive process of gelatin with trypsin was also demonstrated by combining gelatin-modified silica colloidal crystal films with RIfS. The system showed excellent sensitivity with a wide linear range and could achieve real-time measurement of each process. It has been proved that this is a promising method to construct biosensors using silica colloidal crystal films as interference-sensitive substrates.",Design and Demonstration of Tunable Amplified Sensitivity of AlGaN/GaN High Electron Mobility Transistor (HEMT)-Based Biosensors in Human Serum.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30994326,Analytical chemistry,2019 05 08,"We have developed a swift and simplistic protein immunoassay using aptamer functionalized AlGaN/GaN high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs). The unique design of the sensor facilitates protein detection in a physiological salt environment overcoming charge screening effects, without requiring sample preprocessing. This study reports a tunable and amplified sensitivity of solution-gated electric double layer (EDL) HEMT-based biosensors, which demonstrates significantly enhanced sensitivity by designing a smaller gap between the gate electrode and the detection, and by operating at higher gate voltage. Sensitivity is calculated by quantifying NT-proBNP, a clinical biomarker of heart failure, in buffer and untreated human serum samples. The biosensor depicts elevated sensitivity and high selectivity. Furthermore, detailed investigation of the amplified sensitivity in an increased ionic strength environment is conducted, and it is revealed that a high sensitivity of 80.54 mV/decade protein concentration can be achieved, which is much higher than that of previously reported FET biosensors. This sensor technology demonstrates immense potential in developing surface affinity sensors for clinical diagnostics.",New Platform for the Direct Profiling of microRNAs in Biofluids.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30994325,Analytical chemistry,2019 05 08,"Circulating microRNAs have been identified as potential biomarkers for early detection, prognosis, and prediction of several diseases. Their use in clinical diagnostics has been limited by the lack of suitable detection techniques. Most of the current technologies suffer from requiring complex protocols, not yet able to deliver robust and cost-effective assays in the field of clinical diagnostics. In this work, we report the development of a breakthrough platform for profiling circulating microRNAs. The platform comprises a novel silicon photomultiplier-based reader in conjunction with a chemical-based method for nucleic acid detection. Accurate microRNAs profiling without extraction, pre-amplification, or pre-labeling of the target is now achievable. We designed and synthesized a set of reagents that combined the chemical-based method with a chemiluminescent reaction. The signals generated were read out using a novel, compact silicon photomultiplier-based reader. The platform sensitivity was determined by measuring known concentrations of hsa-miR-21-5p spike-ins. The limit of detection was calculated as 4.7 pmol/L. The platform was also successfully used to directly detect hsa-miR-21-5p in eight non-small cell lung cancer plasma samples. Levels of plasma hsa-miR-21-5p expression were also measured via TaqMan RT-qPCR. The successful integration of the unique chemical-based method for nucleic acid detection with the novel silicon photomultiplier-based reader created an innovative product (ODG platform) with diagnostic utility, for the direct qualitative and quantitative analysis of microRNA biomarkers in biological fluids.",Ultrasensitive On-Site Detection of Biological Active Ricin in Complex Food Matrices Based on Immunomagnetic Enrichment and Fluorescence Switch-On Nanoprobe.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30994324,Analytical chemistry,2019 05 24,"Ricin is a highly toxic protein largely existing in castor beans, which could be used as a warfare agent due to its unique properties. As a deadenylase, inactivation of ricin means a loss of its toxic threat. Therefore, developing simple, accurate, and sensitive on-site detection of biologically active ricin in wide types of complex matrices is most valuable. Here, antifouling polymer brush modified magnetic beads were prepared first and post modified with ricin monoclonal antibody (the MB@P(C-H)-mAbricin) to efficiently capture ricin from various foods and biological matrices. Active ricin obtained in this manner were sequentially determined by a new designed AuNP/QDs nanoassembly. In this double strand oligodeoxynucleotides (dsODN) linked core-satellite nanoprobe, the fluorescence of satellite QDs was extensively quenched by AuNPs due to the dipole-metal interaction. Active ricin can react with its specific depurination substrates which had been inserted in the dsODN linkers. This reaction would trigger the separation of QDs from Au cores by cutting multiple adenines, and then result in the restoration of QDs fluorescence. By coupling with the magnetic enrichment, this AuNP/QDs nanoprobe provided a qualitative result for active ricin in the range from 10.0 to 100.0 ng mL-1 with the limit of detection as low as 7.46 ng mL-1. Compared with previously proposed methods, this on-site detection strategy offered an easy to handle on-site test for trace amounts of active ricin in a wide range of complex matrices.",Light-Enhanced O2-Evolving Nanoparticles Boost Photodynamic Therapy To Elicit Antitumor Immunity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30994323,ACS applied materials & interfaces,2019 05 08,"Breast cancer remains to show high mortality and poor prognosis in women despite of significant progress in recent diagnosis and treatment. Herein, we report the rational design of a highly efficient ultrasmall nanotheranostic agent with excellent photodynamic therapy (PDT) performance to against breast cancer and its metastasis by eliciting antitumor immunity. The ultrasmall nanoagent (3.1 ± 0.4 nm) was fabricated from polyethylene glycol modified Cu2- xSe nanoparticles, β-cyclodextrin, and chlorin e6 under ambient conditions. The resultant nanoplatform (CS-CD-Ce6 NPs) can be passively accumulated into the tumor to exhibit dramatic antitumor efficacy through the excellent PDT effect under near-infrared irradiation. The excellent PDT performance of this nanoplatform is owing to its role as a Fenton-like Haber-Weiss catalyst for the efficient degradation of H2O2 within the tumor to release hydroxyl radicals (·OH) and very toxic singlet oxygen (1O2) under irradiation. The generated vast amounts of reactive oxygen species not only killed primary tumor cells but also elicited immunogenic cell death (ICD) to release damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and induced proinflammatory M1-macrophages polarization. Thereby, antitumor immune responses against the metastasis of breast cancer were robustly evoked. Our work demonstrates that ultrasmall Cu2- xSe nanoparticle-based nanoplatform offers a promising way to prevent cancer metastasis via immunogenic effects through its excellent PDT performance.",Helicobacter pylori and hematological disorders.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30994322,Minerva gastroenterologica e dietologica,2019 04 17,"Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is one of the most common worldwide infection, which can affect adults as children. The prevalence of this bacterium is variable in different countries, depending on various hygienic and socioeconomic conditions and living customs. The major damaged tissues of the infection are in the upper gastrointestinal tract, causing gastritis, gastric and duodenal ulcer and gastrointestinal malignancy. Nevertheless, other disorders are associated with this pathogen, including several hematological diseases, such as iron deficiency anemia, immune thrombocytopenia and vitamin B12 deficiency. A huge of data in literature support these associations, enough to recognize them in the last Maastricht V/Florence Consensus Report by European Study Group. The pathogenic mechanisms underlying the linkage between H. pylori and these hematological disorders are not clearly identified, but certainly the good hematological response reaches after eradication therapy confirm a central role of the bacterium in this scenario. Instead, the pathogenic mechanisms of H. pylori infection, which lead to the occurrence of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma are clearer and more consolidated; so much that nowadays eradication therapy alone represents the only treatment in this disorder, when localized and with a concomitant H. pylori infection.

We compiled the present review in an attempt to upgrade the accuracy of the classification of such polymorphic entities. We focused on three patterns. First, the conventional extra-intestinal manifestations localized to bone and joints, to the eye, to the biliary tree and to the skin. Second, the so-called IBD-like syndromes accompanied by bone marrow-derived anomalies of innate or acquired immunity. Third, specific disorders of the skin and of the lungs. The extra-intestinal manifestations are thought to derive from an altered gut permeability, the release of cross-reacting antigens, and subsequent peripheral inflammation; T helper 17 cells boosted by a polymorphic interleukin 23 circuitry would be the main effectors of this chain. Inflammatory bowel disease-like pictures would derive from inborn errors of the immune response causing undue inflammation home to the gut. Monogenic IBD belong to this subset, and are of specific pediatric interest. Psoriasis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and IBD are all inflammatory disorders of the barrier organs: skin, lungs, and gut. The demonstration that specific antigen hyper- or hyporesponsiveness raised at any of the three districts can modulate the response of the other two sites, has led to the innovative concept of a system-wide mucosal immunological organ. An improved knowledge of these entities has not only a speculative importance, but can also bear a clinical impact, insofar as the extra-intestinal manifestations prove often more disabling than the underlying IBD itself.",Efficacy of EUS-guided and ERCP-guided biliary drainage for malignant biliary obstruction: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30994320,Minerva medica,2019 04 17,"EUS-Guided biliary drainage was used as an alternative method for patients who failed ERCP.

The regional diffe-rences of substitution efficiency were obvious, with the eastern region relying more heavily on the input scale of substitution factors. The most salient provincial-regional difference was the comprehensive efficiency, followed by the pure technical efficiency, and the least salient regional diffe-rence was the scale efficiency nationwide. The provincial-regional difference decreased year by year within each region. The Eastern region's provincial-regional difference was the greatest. The substitution efficiency was significantly affected by agricultural technology level, farmers' income level, agricultural production structure, agricultural development level and industrialization level.

Low carbon agriculture needs to balance higher-level crop yields and lower greenhouse gas emission in production process. Improving nitrogen mana-gement may help mitigate greenhouse gas emission and achieve stable or higher crop yields in crop production systems. In this study, we investigated the effects of nitrogen application rates (150, 225, 300 kg N·hm-2) on the carbon footprint of spring maize-late rice rotation system in paddy field using the life cycle assessment. The results showed that greenhouse gas emission and carbon footprint increased with the nitrogen fertilizer application rates in both crops. Nitrogen fertilizer was the most important contributor to carbon footprint of spring maize ecosystem, accounting for 36.2%-50.2%. Methane emission increased with nitrogen fertilizer input and contributed the most to the carbon footprint of late rice production, accounting for 42.8%-48.0%. When the nitrogen application rate was reduced by 25% (225 kg N·hm-2) and 50% (150 kg N·hm-2), greenhouse gas emission of maize production decreased by 21.9% and 44.3%, and the carbon footprint decreased by 20.3% and 39.1%, respectively. Meanwhile, the greenhouse gas emissions of late rice decreased by 12.3% and 20.4%, and the carbon footprint of late rice decreased by 13.7% and 16.7%, respectively. The reduction of nitrogen fertilizer rate had no significant effect on maize yield, with the treatment of 225 kg N·hm-2 rate holding the highest yield in late rice ecosystem.

The contents of available potassium (AP), slow-acting potassium (SP), mineral potassium (MP), and total potassium (TP) in soil profile under different land use patterns and their relationships were analyzed. Our results showed that compared with the traditional rotation (rice-wheat, rice-oil), soil AP and SP contents significantly varied among different land use patterns. Rice-vegetable rotation increased the contents of AP and SP in the surface soil, while garden land increased the consumption of AP and SP in the soil. For the more stable forms, soil MP and TP, there was no significant difference in their contents under different land use patterns. In the deep soil, the content of AP in the rice-vegetable rotation pattern was significantly decreased with deepening soil layer, and the AP in traditional rotation was significantly higher than that in garden land. The trend of SP was opposite to that of AP. The difference of MP and TP in different land use patterns was small. Among the four land use patterns, the ratio of AP to TP and SP to TP in the lower layer of rice-vegetable rotation was higher than that in other patterns, while the ratio of AP to TP decreased significantly under different land use patterns at 20-40 cm. The change of SP to TP with the downward ratio of soil layer was opposite to that of AP to TP. Additionally, the ratio of MP to TP was relatively stable under different land use patterns.

The distribution rates of 15N in reproductive organ (fruit) and vegetative organs (leaf, deciduous spur, new branch, and fine root) were highest under four-time application, and lowest under one-time application. The opposite pattern was observed in storage organs (trunk, perennial branch, and coarse root). The 15N utilization rate under four-time application was 27.4% and 15.5% higher than one-time and two-time application, respectively. The more times N being applied, the more total N content and 15N absorption amount of plant. Soil 15N abundance and total N content continued to drop under one-time application and increased at the beginning and then declined with the time under two-time application. The relatively stable soil 15N abundance and total N content appeared in four-time application, which was significantly higher than those in the other treatments in later treatment stages. The chlorophyll content, leaf nitrogen content and photosynthetic rate displayed an order of four-time application > two-time application > one-time application during fruit white-mature period to fruit harvest period. The accumulation and distribution of 13C varied across different treatments. Increasing nitrogen application times would promote more 13C being transported to fruit and storage organs but decrease that in annual vegetative organs.

The results showed that, with the increases of urea application, the chlorophyll content, nitrogen content, net photosynthetic rate, sorbitol and sucrose content, sorbitol 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (S6PDH) and sucrose phosphate synthase (SPS) activities, 13C assimilation capability of leaves were first increased and then decreased, with the highest value in 1.8% urea smear treatment and the lowest value with the treatment of clear water. The 13C of self retention (self leaves and self branches) was the highest in clear water (81.6%) and the lowest in 1.8% urea smear treatment (63.5%). The 13C was mainly allocated to fruit, followed by unlabeled perennial branch, and the lowest in unlabeled leaves.

The results showed that adding biochar increased per plant yield of cucumber by 11.4% and 62.8% compared with continuous cropping soil of 6 years and 10 years, respectively. Biochar addition significantly decreased two continuous cropping soils bulk density, increased the content of soil organic matter, available P content, cation exchange capacity (CEC) and soil pH. Meanwhile, biochar addition remarkably improved the abundance of bacteria, ratio of bacteria/fungi, but reduced the abundance of fungi and fusarium oxysporum, which made fungal type soil turn to bacterial type soil.

The treatments were: controlled-release fertilizer, microbial fertilizer, nitrification inhibitor and farmer's practice (control). The results showed that the wheat yield from the microbial fertilizer treatment in 2016 was significantly lower than that from the controlled-release fertilizer treatment and the nitrification inhibitor treatment, but was not significantly different from conventional farmer fertilization. The N uptake of wheat and annual crops in the microbial fertilizer treatment was significantly reduced. There was no significant difference in crop yield and N uptake among the treatments in 2017. Soil fertility of the tillage layer was maintained or improved in all three treatments compared with the control, and the contents of alkali-hydrolyzed nitrogen, available potassium and organic matter increased with the increase of plant growth period in the microbial fertilizer treatment. Microbial fertilizer and nitrification inhibitor reduced the inorganic N content in the 40-100 cm soil profile, while controlled-release fertilizer increased the inorganic N content in the 0-40 cm soil layer. N loss through ammonia volatilization was higher than that through leaching, which was greater than the loss through N2O emission. Runoff loss was negligible. Among the treatments, N loss in farmer's practice treatment was the highest. Microbial fertilizer significantly reduced N loss through ammonia volatilization, but the loss through leaching was larger. In conclusion, with reduced N application compared with the farmer's practice, controlled release fertilizer and nitrification inhibitor could maintain crop yield and N uptake, and microbial fertilizer could ensure crop yield and N uptake for a longer plant growth period. The results suggested that inorganic N content in the 40-100 cm soil layer could be reduced in the soil by adding microbial fertilizer and nitrification inhibitors, and the amount of inorganic N was not reduced significantly by application of controlled release fertilizer.

We previously identified the hippocampus as a major brain region that differs in rats bred for emotionality differences. Rats bred for low novelty response (LRs) exhibit high levels of anxiety- and depression-like behavior compared to high novelty responder (HR) rats. Manipulating the hippocampus of high-anxiety LR rats improves their behavior, although no work to date has examined possible HR/LR differences in hippocampal synaptic physiology. Thus, the current study examined hippocampal slice electrophysiology, dendritic spine density, and transcriptome profiling in HR/LR hippocampus, and compared performance on three hippocampus-dependent tasks: The Morris water maze, contextual fear conditioning, and active avoidance. Our physiology experiments revealed increased long-term potentiation (LTP) at CA3-CA1 synapses in HR versus LR hippocampus, and Golgi analysis found an increased number of dendritic spines in basal layer of CA1 pyramidal cells in HR versus LR rats. Transcriptome data revealed glutamate neurotransmission as the top functional pathway differing in the HR/LR hippocampus. Our behavioral experiments showed that HR/LR rats exhibit similar learning and memory capability in the Morris water maze, although the groups differed in fear-related tasks. LR rats displayed greater freezing behavior in the fear-conditioning task, and HR/LR rats adopted distinct behavioral strategies in the active avoidance task. In the active avoidance task, HRs avoided footshock stress by pressing a lever when presented with a warning cue; LR rats, on the other hand, waited until footshocks began before pressing the lever to stop them. Taken together, these findings concur with prior observations of HR rats generally exhibiting active stress coping behavior while LRs exhibit reactive coping. Overall, our current findings coupled with previous work suggest that HR/LR differences in stress reactivity and stress coping may derive, at least in part, from differences in the developing and adult hippocampus.",Vitiligo in a patient receiving infliximab for chronic plaque psoriasis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30994249,Dermatologic therapy,2019 04 30,"Infliximab is a tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a) inhibitor widely used in the treatment of moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis.

The most severe impacts of such scarring on patients' lives are stigmatization and physical restriction. Although, a broad variety of combinatorial approaches with, e.g., glucocorticoids, chemotherapeutics, and immunomodulators are used, there is still a high recurrence rate of keloids. The aim of this study was to investigate which influence interferon γ (IFN-γ, 1.000-10.000 IU/mL) and/or triamcinolone acetonide (TA, 1 μg/mL) have on proliferation, cell viability, collagen type I synthesis, and cytokine secretion in healthy and keloid fibroblasts. It was shown that mono-treatment with IFN-γ or TA for 2 days induced a severe reduction of the proliferative potential in both cell species. The combinatory treatment (IFN-γ plus TA) of keloid fibroblasts enhanced the anti-proliferative effect of the mono-treatments, whereas no additional anti-proliferative effect was observed in normal fibroblasts. Furthermore, we observed that the combinatory treatment regimen reduced the expression of α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), an actin isotype contributing to cell-generated mechanical tension, in keloid fibroblasts. In normal fibroblasts, α-SMA was reduced by the mono-treatment with IFN-γ as well as by the combinatory treatment. The analysis of collagen-type I synthesis revealed that TA did not reduce collagen type I synthesis in normal fibroblasts but in keloid fibroblasts. IFN-γ reduced in both cell species the collagen type I synthesis. The combination of TA and IFN-γ intensified the previously observed collagen type I synthesis reduction in keloid fibroblasts. The herein presented data suggest the combinatory application of IFN-γ and TA as a promising therapy concept for keloids.",Comprehensive analysis of isolated der(1;7)(q10;p10) in a large international homogenous cohort of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30994215,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",2019 04 30,"The karyotype is a strong independent prognostic factor in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Since the implementation of the new comprehensive cytogenetic scoring system for MDS, chromosome 7 anomalies are no longer generally assigned to poor risk features but are thoroughly separated. However, der(1;7)(q10;p10), hereinafter der(1;7), is merged into the group labeled ""any other single"" and belongs to the intermediate risk group, just by definition due to lack of adequate clinical data. The aim of our international collaborative was to clarify the ""real"" prognostic impact of der(1;7) on a homogenous and well-documented data base. We performed detailed analysis of 63 MDS patients with isolated der(1;7) constituting the largest cohort hitherto reported. Furthermore, clinical data are compared with those of patients with isolated del(7q) and isolated monosomy 7. Median overall survival (OS) of patients with der(1;7) is 26 months (hazard ratio (HR) 0.91 for del(7q) vs der(1;7) and 2.53 for monosomy 7 vs der(1;7)). The der(1;7) is associated with profound thrombocytopenia most probably causing the reduced OS which is in striking contrast to the low risk for AML transformation (HR 3.89 for del(7q) vs der(1;7) and 5.88 for monosomy 7 vs der(1;7)). Molecular karyotyping indicates that der(1;7) is generated in a single step during mitosis and that a chromosomal imbalance rather than a single disrupted gene accounts for malignancy. Thus, the current cytogenetic scoring system assigning isolated der(1;7) to the intermediate risk group is now confirmed by a sufficient data set.",Light Lanthanide Metallocenium Cations Exhibiting Weak Equatorial Anion Interactions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30994214,"Chemistry (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)",2019 06 13,"As the dysprosocenium complex [Dy(Cpttt )2 ][B(C6 F5 )4 ] (Cpttt =C5 H2 tBu3 -1,2,4, 1-Dy) exhibits magnetic hysteresis at 60 K, similar lanthanide (Ln) complexes have been targeted to provide insights into this remarkable property. We recently reported homologous [Ln(Cpttt )2 ][B(C6 F5 )4 ] (1-Ln) for all the heavier Ln from Gd-Lu; herein, we extend this motif to the early Ln. We find, for the largest LnIII cations, that contact ion pairs [Ln(Cpttt )2 {(C6 F5 -κ1 -F)B(C6 F5 )3 }] (1-Ln; La-Nd) are isolated from reactions of parent [Ln(Cpttt )2 (Cl)] (2-Ln) with [H(SiEt3 )2 ][B(C6 F5 )4 ], where the anion binds weakly to the equatorial sites of [Ln(Cpttt )2 ]+ through a single fluorine atom in the solid state. For smaller SmIII , [Sm(Cpttt )2 ][B(C6 F5 )4 ] (1-Sm) is isolated, which like heavier 1-Ln does not exhibit equatorial anion interactions, but the EuIII analogue 1-Eu could not be synthesised due to the facile reduction of EuIII precursors to EuII products.

The CCR generally requires dual Ni catalysis and MgBr2 promotion, which is effective in diethyl ether but not in THF. NMR spectroscopy revealed a complexation of alkenyl sulfoximines by MgBr2 in diethyl ether, which suggests an acceleration of the oxidative addition through nucleofugal activation. The CCR of alkenyl sulfoximines generally proceeds in the presence of Ni(dppp)Cl2 as a precatalyst and MgBr2 with alkyl- and arylzincs with a high degree of stereoretention at the C and the S atom. CCR of axially chiral alkenyl sulfoximines with Ni(PPh3 )2 Cl2 as a precatalyst and ZnPh2 does not require salt promotion and is stereoretentive. The reaction with Zn(CH2 SiMe3 )2 , however, demands salt promotion and is not stereoretentive. CCR of axially chiral α-methylated alkenyl sulfoximines afforded persubstituted axially chiral alkenes with high selectivity. Alkenyl (N-triflyl)sulfoximines engage in a stereoretentive CCR with Grignard reagents and Ni(PPh3 )2 Cl2 . Ni-Catalyzed and MgBr2 -promoted CCR of E-configured acyclic alkenyl sulfoximines and aminosulfoxonium salts with ZnPh2 and Zn(CH2 SiMe3 )2 is stereoretentive with Ni(dppp)Cl2 and Ni(PPh3 )2 Cl2 . CCRs of acyclic alkenyl sulfoximines and alkenyl aminosulfoxonium salts, carrying a methyl group at the α position, take a different course and give alkenyl sulfinamides under stereoretention at the S and C atom.

The I2 inside the bigger trigonal channel forms a I-I⋅⋅⋅I-I⋅⋅⋅I-I halogen-bonded infinite helical chain, while the I2 in the smaller hexagonal channel is disordered. In both channels the I2 interaction with the channel wall happens through I-I⋅⋅⋅Cl- halogen bonds. The helical channels in the crystal lattice are constructed via the strong charge-assisted H2 N+ H⋅⋅⋅Cl- hydrogen bonds between the dications and the chloride anions. The structure shows a marked similarity with the well-known starch-I2 system, and thus may provide insight for the yet unresolved structure of the I2 in the helical starch channel.","Performance of care for end-of-life cancer patients in Tuscany: The interplay between place of care, aggressive treatments, opioids, and place of death.

There is a lower probability of dying in acute care setting for patients assisted in hospices and in both hospital and hospices/home care and for patients treated with opioids. This intraregional variation highlights the need to improve EOL planning and rethink the delivery of supportive/palliative care.

As a key component of PBF, quantity verification is carried out to ensure that reported data matches the actual number of services provided. However, cost concerns have led to a call for risk-based verification. Existing evidence suggests misreporting is associated with factors such as complexity of indicators, high service volume, and accepted error margin. In contrast, evidence on the association of key facility characteristics with misreporting in PBF is scarce. We contributed to filling this gap in knowledge by combining administrative data from a large-scale pilot PBF program in Burkina Faso with data from a health facility assessment in the context of an impact evaluation of the intervention. Our results showed the coexistence of both overreporting and underreporting and that misreporting varied by service indicator and health district. We also found that the number of clinical staff at the facility, the population size in the facility catchment area, and the distance between the facility and the district administration were associated with the probability of misreporting. We recommend further research of these factors in the move towards risk-based verification. In addition, given that our analysis identified relevant associations, but could not explain them, we recommend further qualitative inquiry into verification processes.",Family and friends: Supporting oral care in care homes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30994206,Gerodontology,2019 04 17,To consider the role of family and friends in supporting oral care.

The analysis of microbial community sequencing data presents great statistical challenges, especially when the samples have different library sizes and the data are overdispersed with many zeros. To address these challenges, we introduce a new statistical framework, called predictive analysis in metagenomics via inverse regression (PAMIR), to analyze microbiome sequencing data. Within this framework, an inverse regression model is developed for overdispersed microbiota counts given the trait, and then a prediction rule is constructed by taking advantage of the dimension-reduction structure in the model. An efficient Monte Carlo expectation-maximization algorithm is proposed for maximum likelihood estimation. The method is further generalized to accommodate other types of covariates.

A ""lifetime immunization schedule"" is aimed to reduce the burden and the related costs of vaccine-preventable diseases through effective vaccination programs. However, to counteract the national steady downward trend in the uptake of vaccinations that caused a drop of the vaccination coverage below the 95% threshold to allow herd immunity, it was decided to make 10 vaccinations mandatory by the law 119/2017. In particular, in addition to already mandatory vaccinations against diphtheria, tetanus, hepatitis B and poliomyelitis, those against measles, mumps, rubella (MMR), varicella, pertussis and Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) were added to the list. According to the law, all unvaccinated children cannot attend preschool services until the age of 6 years and fines (from 100 to 500 Euros) are provided for parents. Moreover, this law provided, in its first application, a catch-up campaign for children up to the age of 16 years and the free-of-charge offer of all mandatory and recommended vaccines to each child not yet vaccinated according to the previous NPVP. The NPVP includes also several at risk categories, such as pregnant women, healthcare workers and subjects suffering from chronic diseases, to whom specific vaccinations, free of charge, are offered. The vaccinations of pregnant women have different purposes. In order to decrease the pertussis risk in newborns in the first months of life, a booster immunization of DTPa is recommended, at every pregnancy, between week 27th and 36th. Instead, the inﬂuenza vaccine administration to pregnant women during the second or third quarter is mainly aimed to avoid the risk of serious disease complications for both the mother and the fetus. Another group of at risk subjects included in the NPVP is that made up by healthcare workers. According to the plan, ""an adequate immunization of the healthcare workers is essential for the prevention and control of infections (anti-hepatitis B, anti-influenza, anti-measles-mumps-rubella, anti-varicella, anti-pertussis)"". Finally, almost all the vaccinations foreseen by the NPVP are offered free of charge to subjects suffering from specific diseases. These include cardiovascular, respiratory, hepatic, neoplastic, renal and metabolic disorders, in addition to immunosuppression that exposes them to an increased risk of contracting invasive infectious diseases.","How should vaccination services be planned, organized, and managed?

The existence of a scattering pre-peak in this mixture is unexpected, specifically in view of its absence in aqueous 1-propanol or aqueous DMSO mixtures. The detailed analysis of the various atom-atom structure factors and snapshots indicates that significant micro-structures exist, which produces correlation pre-peaks in the atom-atom structure factors, positive for like species atom correlations and negative for cross species correlations. The scattering pre-peak depends on how these two contributions cancel out or not. The way the amine group bonds with water produces a pre-peak through an imbalance of the positive and negative scattering contributions, unlike 1-propanol and DMSO, where these 2 contributions compensate exactly. Hence molecular simulations demonstrate how chemical details influence the microscopic segregation in different types of molecular emulsions and can be detected or not by scattering experiments.",AgxH3-xPMo12O40/Ag nanorods/g-C3N4 1D/2D Z-scheme heterojunction for highly efficient visible-light photocatalysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30994131,"Dalton transactions (Cambridge, England : 2003)",2019 05 17,"Reasonably designing Z-scheme photocatalysts has been deemed to be an ideal and prospective way to develop new and highly efficient photocatalytic materials for removing environmental pollutants.

MATERIAL AND METHODS Buccal (saliva) and lower respiratory tract BALF samples were collected from 51 patients with primary bronchogenic carcinoma and 15 healthy controls, and bacterial genomic DNA was extracted. High-throughput 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing was performed, and microbial diversity, composition, and functions of microbiota were analyzed by bioinformatics methods. RESULTS Patients with lung cancer have lower microbial diversity than healthy controls in both saliva and BALF samples. Significant segregation was observed between the different pathological types of lung cancer groups and the control group regardless of the sampling site. Treponema and Filifactor were identified as potential bacterial biomarkers in BALF samples, while Filifactor was ideal to distinguish healthy controls from lung cancer patients. Moreover, the predictive variation analysis of the KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) metabolic pathway showed that the metabolic differences in microbiota varied by sampling site. CONCLUSIONS Lung cancer patients carry a different and less diverse microorganism community than healthy controls. Certain bacterial taxa might be associated with lung cancer, but the exact species depends on the sampling site and the pathological type. This study provides basic data on the microbiota diversity in BALF and saliva samples from lung cancer patients.

Similar comparisons were undertaken for influenza A(H3N2)-dominant epidemics.ResultsIn 2018/19, more influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 cases were under 10 years old than controls (29% vs 16%; p < 0.001). In particular, children aged 5-9 years comprised 14% of cases, greater than their contribution to controls (4%) or the general population (5%) and at least twice their contribution in 2015/16 (7%; p < 0.001) or 2013/14 (5%; p < 0.001). Conversely, children aged 10-19 years (11% of the population) were under-represented among A(H1N1)pdm09 cases versus controls in 2018/19 (7% vs 12%; p < 0.001), 2015/16 (7% vs 13%; p < 0.001) and 2013/14 (9% vs 12%; p = 0.12).ConclusionChildren under 10 years old contributed more to outpatient A(H1N1)pdm09 medical visits in 2018/19 than prior seasonal epidemics in Canada. In 2018/19, all children under 10 years old were born after the 2009 A(H1N1)pdm09 pandemic and therefore lacked pandemic-induced immunity. In addition, more than half those born after 2009 now attend school (i.e. 5-9-year-olds), a socio-behavioural context that may enhance transmission and did not apply during prior A(H1N1)pdm09 epidemics.","Missed opportunities for HIV testing in people diagnosed with HIV, Estonia, 2014 to 2015.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30994106,Euro surveillance : bulletin Europeen sur les maladies transmissibles = European communicable disease bulletin,2019 05 06,Studies of missed opportunities for earlier diagnosis of HIV have shown that patients with undiagnosed HIV often present to healthcare settings numerous times before eventually receiving their diagnosis.,"Changing epidemiology of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in 42 hospitals in the Dutch-German border region, 2012 to 2016: results of the search-and-follow-policy.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30994105,Euro surveillance : bulletin Europeen sur les maladies transmissibles = European communicable disease bulletin,2019 05 02,"IntroductionMeticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a major cause of healthcare-associated infections.AimWe describe MRSA colonisation/infection and bacteraemia rate trends in Dutch-German border region hospitals (NL-DE-BRH) in 2012-16.MethodsAll 42 NL-DE BRH (8 NL-BRH, 34 DE-BRH) within the cross-border network EurSafety Health-net provided surveillance data (on average ca 620,000 annual hospital admissions, of these 68.0% in Germany). Guidelines defining risk for MRSA colonisation/infection were reviewed. MRSA-related parameters and healthcare utilisation indicators were derived. Medians over the study period were compared between NL- and DE-BRH.ResultsMeasures for MRSA cases were similar in both countries, however defining patients at risk for MRSA differed. The rate of nasopharyngeal MRSA screening swabs was 14 times higher in DE-BRH than in NL-BRH (42.3 vs 3.0/100 inpatients; p < 0.0001). The MRSA incidence was over seven times higher in DE-BRH than in NL-BRH (1.04 vs 0.14/100 inpatients; p < 0.0001). The nosocomial MRSA incidence-density was higher in DE-BRH than in NL-BRH (0.09 vs 0.03/1,000 patient days; p = 0.0002) and decreased significantly in DE-BRH (p = 0.0184) during the study. The rate of MRSA isolates from blood per 100,000 patient days was almost six times higher in DE-BRH than in NL-BRH (1.55 vs 0.26; p = 0.0041). The patients had longer hospital stays in DE-BRH than in NL-BRH (6.8 vs 4.9; p < 0.0001). DE-BRH catchment area inhabitants appeared to be more frequently hospitalised than their Dutch counterparts.ConclusionsOngoing IPC efforts allowed MRSA reduction in DE-BRH. Besides IPC, other local factors, including healthcare systems, could influence MRSA epidemiology.","Group A rotavirus surveillance before vaccine introduction in Italy, September 2014 to August 2017.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30994104,Euro surveillance : bulletin Europeen sur les maladies transmissibles = European communicable disease bulletin,2019 05 15,"IntroductionGroup A rotaviruses (RVA) are the leading cause of acute gastroenteritis (AGE) in young children, causing ca 250,000 deaths worldwide, mainly in low-income countries. Two proteins, VP7 (glycoprotein, G genotype) and VP4 (protease-sensitive protein, P genotype), are the basis for the binary RVA nomenclature. Although 36 G types and 51 P types are presently known, most RVA infections in humans worldwide are related to five G/P combinations: G1P[8], G2P[4], G3P[8], G4P[8], G9P[8].AimThis study aimed to characterise the RVA strains circulating in Italy in the pre-vaccination era, to define the trends of circulation of genotypes in the Italian paediatric population.MethodsBetween September 2014 and August 2017, after routine screening in hospital by commercial antigen detection kit, 2,202 rotavirus-positive samples were collected in Italy from children hospitalised with AGE; the viruses were genotyped following standard European protocols.ResultsThis 3-year study revealed an overall predominance of the G12P[8] genotype (544 of 2,202 cases; 24.70%), followed by G9P[8] (535/2,202; 24.30%), G1P[8] (459/2,202; 20.84%) and G4P[8] (371/2,202; 16.85%). G2P[4] and G3P[8] genotypes were detected at low rates (3.32% and 3.09%, respectively). Mixed infections accounted for 6.49% of cases (143/2,202), uncommon RVA strains for 0.41% of cases (9/2,202).ConclusionsThe emergence of G12P[8] rotavirus in Italy, as in other countries, marks this genotype as the sixth most common human genotype. Continuous surveillance of RVA strains and monitoring of circulating genotypes are important for a better understanding of rotavirus evolution and genotype distribution, particularly regarding strains that may emerge from reassortment events.",Host Selection of Field-Collected Anopheles jeyporiensis and Anopheles nivipes in Bangladesh.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30994103,The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene,2019 06 06,"Anopheles jeyporiensis and Anopheles nivipes appear to play an important role in contemporary malaria transmission in Bangladesh. However, very little is known about the natural host selection of these vectors. Therefore, host selection of these two species was investigated in Bandarban, the most malarious region of Bangladesh. A total of 480 engorged mosquitoes were analyzed. The human blood index (HBI) of An. jeyporiensis varied from 4.17% in outdoor to 19.17% in indoor collections. Similarly, HBI of An. nivipes ranged between 0.83% and 22.50% from outdoor to indoor. For both species, cow blood indices were significantly higher than HBI in both indoor and outdoor collections. These data demonstrate the opportunistic and zoophilic nature of An. jeyporiensis and An. nivipes, which suggests that approaches such as zooprophylasis may prove beneficial as a control strategy.","Feasibility, Acceptability, and Accuracy of Vaginal Self-Sampling for Screening Human Papillomavirus Types in Women from Rural Areas in Senegal.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30994102,The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene,2019 06 06,"Vaginal self-sampling and human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA testing can be useful tools for women with limited access to health care living in sub-Saharan Africa. To assess the feasibility and acceptability of vaginal self-sampling and high-risk HPV prevalence in two villages of central Senegal, women were asked to self-sample vaginal swabs for HPV detection in May, 2016. Vaginal swabs were collected from 133 women and were tested for HPV genotyping. The acceptability rate of vaginal self-sampling was 98.5%, and 99.2% of the women (133/134) used the device correctly. The quality of self-sampling was satisfactory in 100% of the samples; 10.5% of the samples were positive for HPV, including 6% with high-risk HPV types and 4% with low-risk HPV types. This preliminary study indicates that vaginal self-sampling is a valuable strategy for high-risk HPV detection and cervical cancer screening in a population of women not attending gynecologic screening in rural areas of Senegal."

An effective vaccine would be an ideal additional tool for reducing malaria's impact. Sanaria® PfSPZ Vaccine, composed of radiation-attenuated, aseptic, purified, cryopreserved Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) sporozoites (SPZ) has been well tolerated and safe in malaria-naïve and experienced adults in the United States and Mali and protective against controlled human malaria infection with Pf in the United States and field transmission of Pf in Mali, but had not been assessed in younger age groups. We, therefore, evaluated PfSPZ Vaccine in 93 Tanzanians aged 45 years to 6 months in a randomized, double-blind, normal saline placebo-controlled trial. There were no significant differences in adverse events between vaccinees and controls or between dosage regimens. Because all age groups received three doses of 9.0 × 105 PfSPZ of PfSPZ Vaccine, immune responses were compared at this dosage. Median antibody responses against Pf circumsporozoite protein and PfSPZ were highest in infants and lowest in adults. T-cell responses were highest in 6-10-year olds after one dose and 1-5-year olds after three doses; infants had no significant positive T-cell responses. The safety data were used to support initiation of trials in > 300 infants in Kenya and Equatorial Guinea. Because PfSPZ Vaccine-induced protection is thought to be mediated by T cells, the T-cell data suggest PfSPZ Vaccine may be more protective in children than in adults, whereas infants may not be immunologically mature enough to respond to the PfSPZ Vaccine immunization regimen assessed.",Multilevel Analysis of Factors Associated with Treatment-Seeking Behaviors among Caregivers with Febrile Children in Malawi.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30994089,The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene,2019 06 06,"Early diagnosis and treatment of childhood fever, an important sign of potentially serious infections such as malaria, is essential for controlling disease progression, and ultimately, preventing deaths. This study examined individual- and community-level factors associated with treatment-seeking behaviors and promptness in these behaviors among caregivers of febrile under-five children in Malawi. The 2015-2016 Malawi Demographic Health Survey was used to analyze a nationally representative sample of 4,133 under-five children who had fever within 2 weeks before the survey. A multilevel logistic regression model was used to examine the association between individual- and community-level factors and treatment-seeking behaviors. Approximately 67.3% of the caregivers reported seeking treatment for their febrile child, whereas only 46.3% reported promptly seeking treatment. Children from communities with moderate and high percentages of educated caregivers were more likely to be taken for treatment (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.26, 95% CI = 1.01-1.58 and aOR = 1.31, 95% CI = 1.02-1.70, respectively) than those from communities with a low percentage of educated caregivers. Children from communities with moderate and high percentages of caregivers complaining about the distance to a health facility were less likely to be taken for treatment (aOR = 0.74, 95% CI = 0.58-0.96 and aOR = 0.67, 95% CI = 0.51-0.88, respectively). At the individual level, having a cough in the last 2 weeks, region, religion, and having better health behaviors in other health dimensions were associated with fever treatment-seeking behaviors among Malawian caregivers. Programs aimed at improving treatment-seeking behaviors should consider these factors and the regional variations observed in this study.",A Prospective Study on the Impact and Out-of-Pocket Costs of Dengue Illness in International Travelers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30994088,The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene,2019 06 06,"Although the costs of dengue illness to patients and households have been extensively studied in endemic populations, international travelers have not been the focus of costing studies. As globalization and human travel activities intensify, travelers are increasingly at risk for emerging and reemerging infectious diseases, such as dengue. This exploratory study aims to investigate the impact and out-of-pocket costs of dengue illness among travelers. We conducted a prospective study in adult travelers with laboratory-confirmed dengue and recruited patients at travel medicine clinics in eight different countries from December 2013 to December 2015. Using a structured questionnaire, we collected information on patients and their health-care utilization and out-of-pocket expenditures, as well as income and other financial losses they incurred because of dengue illness. A total of 90 patients participated in the study, most of whom traveled for tourism (74%) and visited countries in Asia (82%). Although 22% reported hospitalization and 32% receiving ambulatory care while traveling, these percentages were higher at 39% and 71%, respectively, after returning home. The out-of-pocket direct and indirect costs of dengue illness were US$421 (SD 744) and US$571 (SD 1,913) per episode, respectively, averaging to a total out-of-pocket cost of US$992 (SD 2,052) per episode. The study findings suggest that international travelers incur important direct and indirect costs because of dengue-related illness. This study is the first to date to investigate the impact and out-of-pocket costs of travel-related dengue illness from the patient's perspective and paves the way for future economic burden studies in this population.",A Critical Enquiry into Variability of Insecticidal Net Use in Cambodia: Implications for Assessing Appropriateness of Malaria Elimination Interventions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30994087,The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene,2019 06 06,"Distributing long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) to individuals living in malaria-endemic regions is a cornerstone of global malaria control. National malaria control programs aim to achieve ""universal coverage"" of at-risk populations to reach LLINs' full potential to reduce malaria, progress of which is then measured by indicators constructed from standardized questionnaires. Through an exploration of variability in LLIN use in Cambodia, we argue that indicators of universal coverage of LLINs are not sufficiently commensurate with the realities they are intended to measure, limiting the suitability of the data to serve program and policy purposes in a malaria elimination era. Reflecting on the various sources of variability in LLIN use, we apply and extend the concept of ""appropriateness"" as a third prong to the widely used ""efficacy"" and ""effectiveness"" criteria for evaluating LLINs as a tool for malaria prevention. Describing first the different dimensions of the intervention and the sociocultural context separately, we will further show how the variability underlying both is affected and induced by inappropriate aspects of the intervention and the measurements of its impact. We consider the gap between ""net use"" and the numerical representations of such local net use justifies further exploration of potential strategies to improve LLIN use in subgroups where persisting malaria transmission clusters.",Pakistan Developmental Origins of Health and Disease (DOHaD) Society: addressing the 'DO' component of DOHaD.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30994086,Journal of developmental origins of health and disease,2019 04 17,"Adverse intrauterine environment could serve as an important stimulus for postnatal altered health status and for increased susceptibility to long-term non-communicable diseases (NCDs).

However, given the changes occurring in the labor market, there is a need to develop a measure specially adapted to the contingent workers specific employment relationship. Thus, this study assesses an HRP system scale that was administered to temporary agency workers (TAW) to examine the scale's response process, internal structure and relation to other variables (i.e., affective commitment). The measure was administered to 4,551 Portuguese TAW. The Messick's validation framework (1995) was use and two sectors were compared. Descriptive analyses, scale reliabilities, item characteristics, exploratory, confirmatory, and multiple group analyses demonstrated that the measure had good psychometric properties. Moreover, there were positive correlations between the HRP scale and affective commitment. The results contribute to a better understanding of managing TAW's in agencies and client companies. HRP are a valuable method for ""communicating"" with these workers, who are then able to recognize and respond to the investment. This is the first study to develop and assess the psychometric properties of an HRP system measure for TAW and to cross-validate it with workers' affective commitment towards both companies that are involved in this employment relation.",The resolution process and the timing of settlement of medical malpractice claims.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30994084,"Health economics, policy, and law",2019 04 17,"We draw on uniquely detailed micro-level data from a Belgian professional medical liability insurer to examine how different procedural and legal events that take place during the unfolding of a medical malpractice claim influence the timing of its settlement. Utilizing the competing risks regression framework, we find that settlement hazard is all else equal statistically significantly positively associated with the completion of those procedural and legal events that most effectively reveal factual information about the underlying medical malpractice case. Consistent with theory, settlement hazard is either unassociated or even negatively associated with the completion of other procedural and legal events. Our analysis, therefore, provides policy insights into which aspects of the resolution process could be emphasized, and which de-emphasized, in order to reduce the often excessive duration of medical malpractice claims and its adverse effects on the healthcare system.",Emotional Impact and Perceived Effectiveness of Text-Only versus Graphic Health Warning Tobacco Labels on Adolescents.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30994083,The Spanish journal of psychology,2019 06 13,"The study of smoking in adolescence is of major importance as nicotine dependence often begins in younger groups. Tobacco health warnings have been introduced to inform people of the negative consequences of smoking. This study assessed the emotions and perceived effectiveness of two formats of tobacco warnings on adolescents: Text-only versus graphic warning labels. In addition, we analyzed how emotions predicted their perceived effectiveness. In a cross-sectional study, 413 adolescents (131 smokers, 282 non-smokers) between 13-20 years of age rated their emotions (valence and arousal) and perceived effectiveness towards a set of tobacco warnings. Results showed that graphic warnings evoked higher arousal than text-only warning labels (p = .038). Most of the warning labels also evoked unpleasantness with smokers reporting higher unpleasantness regarding text-only warnings compared to non-smokers (p = .002). In contrast, perceived effectiveness of the warnings was lower in smokers than in non-smokers (p = .029). Finally, high arousal and being a non-smoker explained 14% of the variance of perceiving the warnings more effective. Given the role that warnings may play in increasing health awareness, these findings highlight how smoking status and emotions are important predictors of the way adolescents consider tobacco health labels to be effective.","Market food diversity mitigates the effect of environment on women's dietary diversity in the Agriculture to Nutrition (ATONU) study, Ethiopia.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30994082,Public health nutrition,2019 06 12,"In Ethiopia, women's dietary diversity is low, primarily due to poor food availability and access, both at home and market level.

A meta-analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30994081,Psychological medicine,2019 04 17,"Several studies have demonstrated a vicious cycle of violence, in which experiences of childhood maltreatment (CM) transition into later perpetration of aggressive acts. But evidence for the presence of this cycle in adult women is mixed. The aim of this meta-analysis is to investigate the strength of associations and the mechanisms underlying a cycle of violence in women. Databases were searched for terms related to female aggression, violence, delinquency, antisocial behavior, or offending in addition to exposure to traumatic experiences, abuse, or maltreatment during childhood. Only peer-reviewed studies were included that investigated associations between any type of CM and different acts of aggression. Multi-level meta-analyses were applied, as well as meta-regressions, all based on Cohen's d. K = 34 studies were identified. The overall association between exposure to CM was in the positive but small range (Cohen's d = 0.30). There was no significant difference between specific types of abuse and/or neglect. However, associations were smaller for the perpetration of sexual aggression and violent crime compared with other acts of aggression. These findings underline the long-lasting and devastating impact of CM, including types of maltreatment that were long assumed to be less severe. Due to the limited number of available studies, interactions between types of CM and aggression could not be modeled, thus compromising their probable interacting contribution to the cycle of violence. Early interventions targeting families and women at risk are critical in order to prevent ongoing cycles of violence."

Zeitschrift fur Gefasskrankheiten,2019 04 17,"Background: In primary care, the gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) activity is used for assessing hepatobiliary dysfunction, but is also known to be associated with the risk of cardiovascular events as well as overall mortality. As this knowledge is mainly based on cohorts with middle-aged participants, we aim to assess these associations in elderly patients in a primary care setting. Patients and methods: 6,880 unselected primary care patients, aged 65 years or older, were enrolled by 344 general practitioners all over Germany (getABI study). During seven years of follow-up, coronary heart disease (CHD) events (myocardial infarction or coronary revascularization), cerebrovascular events (stroke or carotid revascularization) and deaths were recorded. Event rates were calculated and Cox regression analysis with adjustment for age, gender, GGT, classical and other risk factors (e.g. education, homocysteine, C-reactive protein, vitamin D) was performed. Results: 1,243 patients died. 27.8 deaths per 1,000 patient years (0.95 confidence interval [0.95 CI]: 26.2-29.3) occurred in the whole cohort. 605 participants had a CHD event, i.e. 16.1 per 1,000 patient years (0.95 CI: 14.8-17.4). 296 cerebrovascular events were observed, i.e. 7.7 per 1,000 patient years (0.95 CI: 6.9-8.6). Cox regression analysis with adjustment for the above-mentioned risk factors showed a significant impact of baseline elevation of GGT above the 3rd quartile (women > 18 U/L, men > 26 U/L) compared to the rest on mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 1.38, 95% CI 1.22-1.56, p < 0.001) and cerebrovascular events (1.39, 95% CI: 1.08-1.79), p = 0.010), whereas the association with CHD events (HR: 1.16, 95% CI: 0.97-1.39, p = 0.103) showed no significance. Conclusions: In a primary care setting, GGT values have a significant association with overall mortality and cerebrovascular events, but not with CHD events in elderly patients.",Cerebral venous thrombosis in adults.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30994053,VASA.

While until the mid of the last century the prognosis of CVT was thought to be poor or even fatal in the majority of cases, the advance and wider use of modern imaging technology since the early 1980s, together with the results of registries and population-based studies, revealed that CVT is more frequent and less life-threatening than previously assumed. However, because headache is frequently the only symptom, many oligosymptomatic cases might be overlooked. Both, CT- and MR-venography are suitable methods to confirm or rule out CVT, while the sensitivity of laboratory tests (D-dimer) alone is too low to rely on.

Eleven riders first performed a control condition that corresponded to jumps over three different obstacles (log wall, brush and tree trunk) before jumping over the same three obstacles in a cross-country course. 3D Kinematics and electromyographic (EMG) activity was synchronously collected which included seven muscles of the riders back, lower and upper limbs. Maximum voluntary isometric strength of knee extensors was also measured before and immediately after the race to investigate potential fatigue. Our results showed similar EMG activity for the different obstacles. Whereas some kinematics alterations were observed between obstacles. Moreover, back movements alterations were recorded between the jumps of the cross-country as compared to the control condition. Finally, muscle strength was not altered after the race. In conclusion, our study indicates that upper and lower body muscles contributed to the realisation of various jumps during a cross-country and that the different configurations of the obstacles did not induced specific muscular and kinematic responses."

It is the most common non-traumatic cause of chronic disability in young adults. An early and accurate diagnosis, and effective disease modifying treatment are key elements of optimum care for people with MS (pwMS). MRI has become a critical tool to confirm the presence of dissemination in space and time of lesions characteristic of inflammatory demyelination, a cornerstone of MS diagnosis, over and above exclusion of numerous differential diagnoses. In the modern era of early and highly effective DMT, follow-up of pwMS also relies heavily on MRI, to both confirm efficacy and for pharmacovigilance. Since criteria for MS rely heavily on MRI, an agreed standardized acquisition and reporting protocol enabling efficient and equitable application across the UK is desirable. Following a recent meeting of MS experts in London (UK), we make recommendations for a standardized UK MRI protocol that captures the diagnostic phase as well as monitoring for safety and treatment efficacy once the diagnosis is established. Our views take into account issues arising from the (repeated) use of contrast agents as well as the advent of (semi-) automated tools to further optimize disease monitoring in pwMS.","Feasibility of measuring sodium, potassium and creatinine from urine sample on dried filter paper.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30994023,Bioanalysis,2019 06 16,"Aim: To develop a bioassay for estimation of sodium, potassium and creatinine in dried urine strips and comparing with their respective concentration in liquid urine samples.

Human monocyte-derived DCs were treated with MRN-100 at two concentrations (50 and 100 μL/mL) for 24 h and then stimulated with or without lipopolysaccharides (LPS). The expression of DC maturation markers was assessed by flow cytometry and the production of cytokines was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Functional assay was performed by co-culturing MRN-100-treated and untreated DCs with allogeneic naïve CD4+ T cells and assaying the T cells' cytokine production. Results show that treatment with MRN-100 significantly upregulated the co-stimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86 and increased human leukocyte antigen-DR (HLA-DR) though not significantly. MRN-100 treatment also significantly increased the production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-10. On the other hand, MRN-100 significantly induced the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 only at high concentrations. Furthermore, DCs pretreated with MRN-100 and either stimulated or not with LPS were able to prime CD4+ T cells to secrete significant amounts of IL-10 while inhibiting the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α. These results indicate that MRN-100 is a powerful anti-inflammatory agent that promotes the generation of an anti-inflammatory immune response in vitro. MRN-100 could be beneficial for treating patients with inflammatory diseases, including arthritis and type 1 diabetes, and its potential benefits should be examined in clinical trials.",Genetic diversity and forensic characteristics of 15 autosomal short tandem repeats in Tibet highland and Guangdong lowland Han Chinese populations.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30994014,Annals of human biology,2019 05 15,"Much attention has been paid to the genetic variants of microsatellites in East Asian populations; however, genetic diversity of high-altitude adaptation in Tibet Han remains largely uncharacterised.",Novel approaches to measuring community integration in adults with cerebral palsy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30994013,Disability and rehabilitation,2019 04 17,"Rehabilitation goals often focus on increasing community integration for adults with disabilities and are measured by objective assessments.

Whereas the C-C scission with the loss of CO2 is usually exothermic, the C-S scission with the loss of SO2 is generally endothermic. However, two factors can make the C-S scissions thermodynamically favorable: increased entropy, characteristic for the dissociative processes, and stereoelectronic influences of substituents. The threshold between endergonic and exergonic C-S fragmentations depends on subtle structural effects. In particular, the degree of fluorination in a radical precursor has a notable impact on the reaction outcome. This study aims to demystify the intricacies in reactivity regarding the generation of radicals from sulfinates and carboxylates, as related to their role in radical cross-coupling.",Performance of 3D-RISM-KH in Predicting Hydration Free Energy: Effect of Solute Parameters.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30993994,The journal of physical chemistry.

This octapyrene porphyrin is easily accessible by a straightforward two-step synthetic approach that involves an octuple Suzuki reaction. The new supramolecular platform can present single- or double-tweezer fullerene hosting behavior. The switch from double- to single-tweezer behavior is triggered by the simple coordination of Zn2+ to the porphyrin. Both the octapyrene porphyrin 2HPOP and its zinc metalloporphyrin analogue ZnPOP show very high affinity for C60 and C70, while simultaneously allowing the discrimination of C70 over C60 in a C60/C70 mixture. The use of 2HPOP and ZnPOP for the enrichment of real fullerene mixtures is also demonstrated.",Regioselective trans-Carboboration of Propargyl Alcohols.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30993987,Organic letters,2019 06 13,"Proper choice of the base allowed trans-diboration of propargyl alcohols with B2(pin)2 to evolve into an exquisitely regioselective procedure for net trans-carboboration. The method is modular as to the newly introduced carbon substituent (aryl, methyl, allyl, benzyl, alkynyl), which is invariably placed distal to the -OH group.",Site Selective Amide Reduction of Cyclosporine A Enables Diverse Derivation of an Important Cyclic Peptide.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30993986,Organic letters,2019 06 10,"Site selective amide reductions of the cyclic undecapeptide, cyclosporine A, have been developed using the combination of a heteroleptic borane catalyst and a silane reductant. Tertiary silane Me2EtSiH provides two unique cyclosporine A derivatives, one of which can be readily diversified in subsequent reactions. The secondary silane Et2SiH2 enables divergent reactivity that uses a free hydroxyl group to direct the reduction. The transient O-silyl hemiaminal intermediate of this reduction can additionally be trapped by reducing to the amine or by reductive cyanation."

However, how to control the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) to maintain the low band gap and improve the NIR-II fluorescence intensity is an urgent issue. Here, the quinoid polymers have been developed to effectively regulate the ICT for brighter NIR-II fluorescence signals. Thiophene repeat chain units of different lengths (T, 2T, and 3T) were utilized to link with electron-withdrawing ester-substituted thieno[3,4- b]thiophene (TT) to alter the density of the electron-withdrawing side groups for controlling the ICT. By increasing the thiophene chain length from TT-T to TT-3T, the density of the electron-withdrawing groups decreased and the ICT was weakened. In the case of NIR absorption and NIR-II emission, weakened ICT leads to brighter NIR-II fluorescence. After the preparation of the water-soluble quinoid polymer probes (CPs), TT-3T CPs with weak ICT exhibited the brightest NIR-II fluorescent signals among the three quinoid polymer probes. Several NIR-II biomedical imaging applications, including in vivo cell tracking, blood vascular system images, and lymphatic drainage mapping, show that the TT-3T CP-based nanoprobe had excellent characteristics of long-term stability and high NIR-II spatial resolutions in vivo.",Fertility preservation in female cancer patients-state of the art.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30993959,Minerva ginecologica,2019 04 17,"Protecting fertility in the presence of cancer has become highly significant, as the desire to give birth to a child is increasingly postponed to later in life, and long-term survival with cancer has increased. A variety of fertility-preserving methods have been developed. To find them we did a literature search in Medline with the term ""female fertility preservation in cancer"" in December 2017. 2381 different publications were found. After screening the abstracts 78 publications in English, French or German language had been assessed as relevant (17 dealing with medicamentous approaches, 6 with surgical approaches, 15 with oocyte cryopreservation, 11 with ovarian tissue cryopreservation and 29 were review articles). In general, there are medicamentous (non-surgical) and surgical approaches. Medicamentous approaches comprise administration of GnRH-analogues during gonad toxic oncologic treatment, and cryopreservation of oocytes after ovarian stimulation. Surgical approaches comprise traditional methods of organ-saving surgery and ovarian transposition outside of the radiation portal as well as ovary cryopreservation as standard. It is important to inquire about a prospective desire to have children with premenopausal women with cancer and comprehensively explain the fertility conserving methods available.",Response of Glucocorticoid Receptor Alpha and Histone Deacetylase 2 to Glucocorticoid Treatment Predicts the Prognosis of Sudden Sensorineural Hearing Loss.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30993958,Clinical and experimental otorhinolaryngology,2019 04 17,To investigate glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) gene expression and protein levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of patients with severe or profound sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL) and to explore the roles of GRs and HDAC2 in glucocorticoid (GC) insensitivity.,Cervical Cancer Screening in HIV-Positive Farmers in South Africa: Mixed-Method Assessment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30993957,Annals of global health,2019 04 17,"In 2015, a See and Treat cervical cancer screening program was implemented at a local HIV clinic in Limpopo, South Africa, where infrastructure limited adequate Pap smear usability.",Assessment of Blood Donation and Transfusion in Eastern Uganda: A Mixed-Methods Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30993956,Annals of global health,2019 04 17,"Blood and blood products are essential in the management of injuries, medical illnesses, and childbirth.

Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) allows morphological and functional assessment of the LV along with soft tissue characterization. Technological advances in cardiac computed tomography (CT) have led to the development of techniques for diagnostic acquisition in LV myocardial disease. Cardiac CT facilitates the characterization of LV myocardial disease based on anatomy, function, and enhancement pattern. LV regional and global functional parameters are evaluated using multi-phasic cine CT images. CT myocardial perfusion facilitates the identification of hemodynamically significant coronary artery stenosis. Cardiac CT with delayed enhancement is used to detect myocardial scarring or fibrosis in myocardial infarction and non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, and for the measurement of extracellular volume fraction in non-ischemic cardiomyopathy. In this review, we review imaging techniques and key imaging features of cardiac CT used for the evaluation of myocardial diseases, along with CMR findings.",Metabolic Consequences of Obstructive Sleep Apnea Especially Pertaining to Diabetes Mellitus and Insulin Sensitivity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30993938,Diabetes & metabolism journal,2019 04 26,"Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and diabetes has been known to be closely related to each other and both diseases impact highly on the public health. There are many evidence of reports that OSA is associated with diabetes with a bidirectional correlation. A possible causal mechanism of OSA to diabetes is intermittent hypoxemia and diabetes to OSA is microvascular complication. However, OSA and diabetes have a high prevalence rate in public and shares the common overlap characteristic and risk factors such as age, obesity, and metabolic syndrome that make it difficult to establish the exact pathophysiologic mechanism between them. In addition, studies demonstrating that treatment of OSA may help prevent diabetes or improve glycemic control have not shown convincing result but have become a great field of interest research. This review outlines the bidirectional correlation between OSA and diabetes and explore the pathophysiologic mechanisms by approaching their basic etiologies."
