Normative (why) models from natural image statistics can help constrain the form and parameters of such classes of models. We focus on recent advances in two particular directions, namely deriving richer forms of divisive normalization, and advances in learning pooling from image statistics. We discuss the incorporation of such components into hierarchical models. We consider both hierarchical unsupervised learning from image statistics, and discriminative supervised learning in deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We further discuss studies on the utility and extensions of the convolutional architecture, which has also been adopted by recent descriptive models. We review the recent literature and discuss the current promises and gaps of using such approaches to gain a better understanding of how cortical neurons represent and process complex visual stimuli.",Analyzing biological and artificial neural networks: challenges with opportunities for synergy?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30785004,Current opinion in neurobiology,2019 06 04,"Deep neural networks (DNNs) transform stimuli across multiple processing stages to produce representations that can be used to solve complex tasks, such as object recognition in images. However, a full understanding of how they achieve this remains elusive. The complexity of biological neural networks substantially exceeds the complexity of DNNs, making it even more challenging to understand the representations they learn. Thus, both machine learning and computational neuroscience are faced with a shared challenge: how can we analyze their representations in order to understand how they solve complex tasks? We review how data-analysis concepts and techniques developed by computational neuroscientists can be useful for analyzing representations in DNNs, and in turn, how recently developed techniques for analysis of DNNs can be useful for understanding representations in biological neural networks. We explore opportunities for synergy between the two fields, such as the use of DNNs as in silico model systems for neuroscience, and how this synergy can lead to new hypotheses about the operating principles of biological neural networks.",Harnessing xylose pathways for biofuels production.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30785001,Current opinion in biotechnology,2019 06 11,"Energy security, environmental pollution, and economic development drive the development of alternatives to fossil fuels as an urgent global priority. Lignocellulosic biomass has the potential to contribute to meeting the demand for biofuel production via hydrolysis and fermentation of released sugars, such as glucose, xylose, and arabinose. Construction of robust cell factories requires introducing and rewiring of their metabolism to efficiently use all these sugars. Here, we review recent advances in re-constructing pathways for metabolism of pentoses, with special focus on xylose metabolism in the most widely used cell factories Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Escherichia coli. We also highlight engineering advanced biofuels-synthesis pathways and describes progress toward overcoming the challenges facing adoption of large-scale biofuel production.",pH control of an upflow pyrite-oxidizing denitrifying bioreactor via electrohydrogenesis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30785000,Bioresource technology,2019 03 20,"Maintenance of stable pH during pyrite-oxidizing denitrification process is important. Here, we demonstrated effective pH control (7.80 ± 0.20-8.40 ± 0.30) in an electrochemical-H2 and pyrite-oxidizing denitrifying bioreactor (HPR) through in situ electrohydrogenesis. HPR achieved a higher nitrate removal activity (maximum:19.66 ± 0.63 mg NO3--N/(L·h)) with excellent resistance to high nitrate loading (up to 400 mg/L NO3--N) compared to that of the control groups. Nitrate removal rate of HPR fitted the Michaelis-Menten kinetic model (R2 = 0.98, p < 0.01) well, and the denitrification followed the zero-order rate law. The results of the biofilm community analyses suggested that Thauera was the dominant bacteria in the cathode biofilm of HPR and may prefer hydrogen as an electron donor for autotrophic denitrification, while the relative abundance of Pseudomonas were similar in the cathode biofilm and pyrite biofilm. This study provides a new alternative for effective pH control in denitrifying bioreactors with pyrite as a packing material.",Stimulation of anaerobic biofilm development in the presence of low concentrations of toxic aromatic pollutants.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784999,Bioresource technology,2019 03 20,"The main aim of this work was to stimulate biofilm formation in the presence of wastewater containing aromatic compounds with different toxicities (EC50). The results indicated that wastewater with an EC50 value >85% accelerates the attachment of bacteria onto the bio-carriers because the toxic wastewater stimulates the production of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) from the seed sludge. In order to understand the role of EPS on biofilm development, experiments were conducted using the seed sludge, from which the soluble, loosely bound, and tightly bound EPS were removed. The soluble EPS fraction was determined to be crucial for biofilm development. Firmicutes bacterium and Clostridium chromoreductans survived and were enriched in the formed biofilms in our study, which can resist toxic aromatics.",Process optimization and kinetic analysis of malic acid production from crude glycerol using Aspergillus niger.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784998,Bioresource technology,2019 03 20,"In the present work, optimization of crude glycerol fermentation to produce malic acid by using Aspergillus niger was investigated using response surface methodology and artificial neural network. Kinetic investigation of bioconversion of crude glycerol into malic acid using Aspergillus niger was studied using Monod, Mosser, and Haldane-Andrew models. Crude glycerol concentration, initial pH and yeast extract concentration were found to be significant compounds affecting malic acid production by Aspergillus niger. Both dry cell weight and malic acid titre were found decreased with increase in crude glycerol concentration. Haldane-Andrew model gave the best fit for the production of malic acid from crude glycerol with µmax of 0.1542 h-1. The maximum malic acid production obtained under optimum conditions was 92.64 + 1.54 g/L after 192 h from crude glycerol using Aspergillus niger.",Assessing the potential of purple phototrophic bacteria for the simultaneous treatment of piggery wastewater and upgrading of biogas.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784997,Bioresource technology,2019 03 20,"The potential of purple phototrophic bacteria (PPB) for the simultaneous treatment of piggery wastewater (PWW) and biogas upgrading was evaluated batchwise in gas-tight photobioreactors. PWW dilution was identified as a key parameter determining the efficiency of wastewater treatment and biomethane quality in PPB photobioreactors. Four times diluted PWW supported the most efficient total organic carbon (TOC) and total nitrogen removals (78% and 13%, respectively), with CH4 concentrations of 90.8%. The influence of phosphorous concentration (supplementation of 50 mg L-1 of P-PO43-) on PPB-based PWW treatment coupled to biogas upgrading was investigated. TOC removals of ≈60% and CH4 concentrations of ≈90.0% were obtained regardless of phosphorus supplementation. Finally, the use of PPB and algal-bacterial consortia supported CH4 concentrations in the upgraded biogas of 93.3% and 73.6%, respectively, which confirmed the potential PPB for biogas upgrading coupled to PWW treatment.",Modelling on the removal of toxic metal ions from aquatic system by different surface modified Cassia fistula seeds.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784996,Bioresource technology,2019 03 20,"The present work demonstrates the preparation of Cassia fistula seeds for producing activated carbon through physical and chemical treatment for the extrusion of Ni(II) ion contaminated aqueous solution. The readily prepared sorbents were characterized using SEM-EDX and FTIR. The surface morphology of sorbents possesses 1 μm mean particle size with uniform size distribution. Furthermore, optimization of operating parameters such as the pH, initial Ni(II) ion concentration, adsorbent dose, time and temperature were investigated. In isotherm and kinetic aspect, Langmuir maximum adsorption capacity of sulphuric acid modified Cassia fistula seeds was 182.2 (mg/g); obeyed Pseudo first order kinetic model. The Ni(II) ion adsorption system undergoes chemisorption, exothermic, feasible and spontaneous. The excellent properties of the Cassia fistula seeds can be alternate for commercial activated carbon.",Extraversion modulates cortisol responses to acute social stress in chronic major depression.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784994,Psychoneuroendocrinology,2019 04 05,"Chronic Major Depressive Disorder (CMDD) is a common, disabling illness that is often complicated by high reactivity to social stress.

A decolorization efficiency of 98% was obtained in sample FRU200 (with 3 g/L fructose added based on 3 g/L yeast extract), which was 21% higher than that without fructose. Several intermediates with low molecular weight generated in sample FRU200 and different metabolic pathways were deduced. The bacterial community structure significantly changed due to fructose addition. Label-free quantitative proteomic approach suggested that several up-regulated proteins in sample FRU200 might play essential roles during the degradation. Furthermore, the mechanisms of RB5 degradation by proteins/enzymes of the dominant species in flora DDMZ1 were proposed. This work deepens our understanding of the molecular and ecological mechanism of fructose as co-metabolite enhancing the biodegradation of refractory organic pollutants by a natural bacterial flora."

Autophagosomes and endosomes sequester cellular cargo through different mechanisms, but these pathways converge upon fusion with lysosomes. Both pathways are spatially regulated, with distinct features evident in the soma, axons, and dendrites, possibly as an adaptation to the unique morphology of neurons and the specific demands of each compartment. Relatively little is known about how autophagy and endo-lysosomal degradation interact and how their activities may be coordinated. We review our current understanding of autophagy and endo-lysosomal degradation in neurons, highlighting common features and differences as well as the intersection of these two essential cellular pathways.",Surveillance and transportation of mitochondria in neurons.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784981,Current opinion in neurobiology,2019 06 07,"Neurons need to allocate and sustain mitochondria to provide adequate energy and sufficient Ca2+-buffering capacity in each sub specialization of their extensive arborizations. Damaged mitochondria, which are highly deleterious to the neuron, must be rapidly repaired or eliminated, even when they are left at terminals extremely far away from the soma. The unique shape of neurons complicates the tasks of both transporting and clearing mitochondria. Errors in the underlying molecular regulations cause detrimental neurodegeneration. Here, we review the molecular machinery and regulatory mechanisms employed to transport, distribute, and clear mitochondria in neurons, and how these fundamental regulations are compromised in neurological disorders.",Molecular constituents and localization of the ionotropic GABA receptor complex in vivo.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784980,Current opinion in neurobiology,2019 06 07,"The ionotropic GABA receptor (GABAAR) mediates fast inhibition in the brain. The GABAAR pore-forming (α, β, and non-α/β) subunits were isolated approximately 30 years ago and have since been the focus of extensive studies. As a result, many properties of GABAARs, including subunit assembly and channel and pharmacological properties, have been discovered. However, several of the underlying mechanisms such as the process for the synaptic localization of GABAARs remain unsolved. A reinvestigation of native GABAAR complexes in the brain and primary neurons identified two major molecular constituents, namely, the transmembrane GARLH/LHFPL protein family and the inhibitory synaptic protein neuroligin 2. This identification of the principal components of native receptor complexes may provide new mechanistic insight on receptor regulation.",Subcellular control of membrane excitability in the axon.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784979,Current opinion in neurobiology,2019 06 07,"Ion channels are microscopic pore proteins in the membrane that open and close in response to chemical and electrical stimuli. This simple concept underlies rapid electrical signaling in the brain as well as several important aspects of neural plasticity. Although the soma accounts for less than 1% of many neurons by membrane area, it has been the major site of measuring ion channel function. However, the axon is one of the longest processes found in cellular biology and hosts a multitude of critical signaling functions in the brain. Not only does the axon initiate and rapidly propagate action potentials (APs) across the brain but it also forms the presynaptic terminals that convert these electrical inputs into chemical outputs. Here, we review recent advances in the physiological role of ion channels within the diverse landscape of the axon and presynaptic terminals.",The travels of mRNAs in neurons: do they know where they are going?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784978,Current opinion in neurobiology,2019 06 07,"Neurons are highly polarized cells that can extend processes far from the cell body. As such, transport of messenger RNAs serves as a set of blueprints for the synthesis of specific proteins at distal sites. RNA localization to dendrites and axons confers the ability to regulate translation with extraordinary precision in space and time. Although the rationale for RNA localization is quite compelling, it is unclear how a neuron orchestrates such a complex task of distributing over a thousand different mRNAs to their respective subcellular compartments. Recent single-molecule imaging studies have led to insights into the kinetics of individual mRNAs. We can now peer into the transport dynamics of mRNAs in both dendrites and axons.","Septin functions during neuro-development, a yeast perspective.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784977,Current opinion in neurobiology,2019 06 07,"Septins, discovered almost half a century ago in yeast, have prominent contributions in a broad range of morphological and functional processes from yeast to human.

We review here recent advances in Septin-mediated processes of neuron differentiation, which enlighten similarities and differences between neuron and yeast polarity programs.",The detoxification effect of liquid digestate on vanadium toxicity to seed germination and seedling growth of dog's tail grass.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784976,Journal of hazardous materials,2019 03 17,"Dog's tail grass (Setaria viridis) presented strong tolerance and high accumulation of vanadium in field conditions. Liquid digestate containing high levels of nutrients could alleviate vanadium toxicity and accelerate the growth of dog's tail grass. To elucidate the detoxification potential and mechanism of liquid digestate, dog's tail grass was grown in soil solution containing 0.14-55.8 mg L-1 of vanadium. Parameters including germination index (GI), tolerance index (TI), seedlings' fresh weight, seedlings' vanadium accumulation, antioxidant enzymes activity, malonaldehyde (MDA) content, and V5+ species, were measured after addition of 1%, 5%, 10% and 15% liquid digestate. The results showed that a vanadium level of 10.9 mg L-1was a threshold value for toxicity; furthermore, the GI and TI decreased by 50% when vanadium content reached 36.8 mg L-1. The MDA content was reduced, and the other parameters were markedly enhanced, after addition of 5% and 10% liquid digestate with vanadium levels above 36.8 mg L-1. V5+ species was the dominant vanadium species in solution and the addition of liquid digestate reduced V5+ concentrations. The detoxification of vanadium by liquid digestate was a combined effect of direct reduction of V5+ species and plant nutrition.",Remediation of soil co-contaminated with decabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-209) and copper by enhanced electrokinetics-persulfate process.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784975,Journal of hazardous materials,2019 03 17,"This work investigated the influences of citric acid and methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MCD) as enhancing agents during the electrokinetics (EK)-persulfate process on the remediation of soil artificially contaminated with decabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-209) and copper (Cu) with an initial concentration of 50 and 1000 mg/kg, respectively. The results clearly demonstrate the efficiency of the process while at the same time, the distribution of the residual contaminants in soil and the EK parameters were greatly influenced by the presence of persulfate, MCD and citric acid. The results show that there was significant removal of BDE-209 and Cu from the soil. MCD-assisted process gave the highest BDE-209 removal (88.6%) and the third largest Cu removal (54.3%) from the soil. Comparatively, the highest Cu removal (92.5%) and the second largest BDE-209 removal (85.6%) were achieved by the joint application of MCD and citric acid in anolyte during the EK-persulfate treatment. MCD and citric acid could increase soil electrical current and electroosmotic flow during EK. The alkalization of soil near cathode was alleviated by the acidic byproducts of persulfate decomposition which could be transported to the soil by electroosmosis and electromigration. This integration process may provide a green efficient technology for remediating co-contaminated soil.",Combined in-situ bioremediation treatment for perchlorate pollution in the vadose zone and groundwater.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784974,Journal of hazardous materials,2019 03 17,"Perchlorate is considered a rapidly spreading environmental pollutant. In Israel, it has been found at high concentrations in the vadose zone (up to 30,000 mg/L) and groundwater (up to 800 mg/L) underlying former industrial waste ponds. A perchlorate-reduction method that utilizes the high degradation potential of shallow soil and the high mobility of perchlorate across the deep unsaturated zone has been proposed. The combined treatment method includes recurrent pumping and application of polluted groundwater amended with an electron donor to the shallow soil layers. As a result, perchlorate is biodegraded in the upper soil, and the treated water drains through the unsaturated zone, displacing the pollutant toward the water table, where it is immediately pumped back to the surface for further treatment through a cyclic process. In the current study, the combined treatment approach was tested in a full-scale unsaturated zone (40 m), long-term (1 year) field experiment. Results showed a daily reduction in perchlorate concentration from 800 mg/L to practically zero. A total of ˜330 kg of perchlorate was reduced during the experiment. Nevertheless, competitive reduction (iron and sulfate) and soil acidification were found to be limiting factors. The study demonstrates a potentially efficient way to overcome these limitations by optimizing electron donor concentration.",Kinetics study on non-thermal plasma mineralization of adsorbed toluene over γ-Al2O3 hybrid with zeolite.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784973,Journal of hazardous materials,2019 03 17,"Non-thermal plasma mineralization of the adsorbed toluene over γ-Al2O3 hybrid with 13X, ZSM-5, and HY was investigated in a sequential adsorption and plasma oxidation system. The γ-Al2O3-13X was shown to have a better plasma oxidation performance with fewer by-products as compared to γ-Al2O3-ZSM-5 and γ-Al2O3-HY, which was due to its better discharge performance and O3 decomposition ability. For all of the tested materials, the plasma mineralization of the adsorbed toluene process had a good match with the pseudo-second-order kinetic model: kt = 1/n - 1/no, where n0 and n are the amount of adsorbed toluene (mmol) at discharge time = 0 and t, respectively. The overall reaction constant (k) was shown to be affected by the packing materials. The reason for the kinetic model following the pseudo-second-order in the sequential process was analyzed based on the chemical reaction and mineralization mechanism."

The authors' research group has improved a pyrolysis biofuel production method for obtaining a biofuel from rice husk. Preliminary research published in Fuel reveals that it has the potential of being used as a gasoline blending component. Before this biofuel can be widely used in real combustors or engines at a large scale, its explosion characteristics should be investigated for the safety consideration during production, transport and storage. This paper quantitatively evaluates explosion pressure, deflagration index, maximum pressure rise rate and combustion duration of this biofuel in the constant volume combustion chamber (CVCC). At the same time, the effects of initial pressure, initial temperature and equivalence ratio on explosion characteristics of this biofuel was also qualitatively analyzed. Linear relationships between explosion pressure, deflagration index, maximum pressure rise rate and combustion duration versus initial pressure and explosion pressure versus initial temperature are given. Results show that explosion pressure is a linear relationship with the initial temperature. However, deflagration index, maximum pressure rise rate and combustion duration are insensitive to the temperature variation.","Physicochemical properties, sensory traits and storage stability of reduced-fat frankfurters formulated by replacing beef tallow with defatted bovine heart.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784961,Meat science,2019 03 19,"The consumer interests for low-fat meat products are increasing to reduce obesity and chronic diseases. Reduced-fat frankfurter (RFF) was prepared by replacing beef tallow with defatted bovine heart (DBH) produced by supercritical-CO2 (SC-CO2) and hexane. Six different frankfurters i.e. control (20% beef fat), T1 (30% fat replacement with non-defatted bovine heart), T2 and T3 (20% and 30%, respectively, fat replacement with SC-CO2-treated DBH), T4 and T5 (20% and 30%, respectively, fat replacement with hexane-treated DBH), were formulated. Physicochemical properties, sensory traits and storage stability of the control and RFFs were investigated. T3 had highest native proteins (18.50 g/100 g) resulting in increased viscosity, emulsion stability, hardness and redness (a⁎) with lowest energy value and cooking loss. T2 showed better sensory attributes than the control and other RFFs.

They are protective (infections) and pathogenic (autoimmunity), although the associated commonalities and differences remain unclear. Heterogeneity within this pool, in terms of origin, fate and function may underlie these divergent roles. Their significance is context-dependent- they may constitute a persistent effector memory cell pool, or products of recent primary responses. In both cases however, T-bet+ cells likely represent antigen-experienced progenitors of antibody-secreting cells with multipotent properties.

Manual annotation of landmarks is a tedious task and prone to observer errors. In this paper, we evaluate novel deep reinforcement learning (RL) strategies to train agents that can precisely and robustly localize target landmarks in medical scans. An artificial RL agent learns to identify the optimal path to the landmark by interacting with an environment, in our case 3D images. Furthermore, we investigate the use of fixed- and multi-scale search strategies with novel hierarchical action steps in a coarse-to-fine manner. Several deep Q-network (DQN) architectures are evaluated for detecting multiple landmarks using three different medical imaging datasets: fetal head ultrasound (US), adult brain and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The performance of our agents surpasses state-of-the-art supervised and RL methods. Our experiments also show that multi-scale search strategies perform significantly better than fixed-scale agents in images with large field of view and noisy background such as in cardiac MRI. Moreover, the novel hierarchical steps can significantly speed up the searching process by a factor of 4-5 times.",Effect of intranasal oxytocin on alcohol withdrawal syndrome: A randomized placebo-controlled double-blind clinical trial.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784955,Drug and alcohol dependence,2019 04 26,"In a pilot study, intranasal oxytocin was demonstrated to reduce the benzodiazepine dose needed to relieve withdrawal symptoms during alcohol detoxification.

Drug-associated cues are reported to elicit craving and cocaine-seeking in humans. Repeated, non-reinforced presentations of drug-associated cues (cue extinction) have been proposed to reduce the ability of such cues to prompt drug-seeking. In rodent models of cocaine relapse, cue extinction reduces cocaine relapse when such extinction occurs in the same context as cocaine self-administration, which is not akin to the manner in which treatment would occur in humans. Here we sought to determine whether cue extinction outside of the cocaine self-administration context would reduce relapse in the drug context. We also hypothesized that ceftriaxone, an antibiotic consistently shown to attenuate cocaine relapse in rats, would enhance the relapse-preventing effects of cue extinction."

It is determined by the deposits of amyloid-beta peptide which leads to memory impairment, oxidative stress, and neurodegeneration. Aromatherapy by using essential oils could represent a natural treatment option for Alzheimer's dementia. Therefore, this study aimed to identify the neuroprotective and nootropic effects of Pinus halepensis essential oil (PNO, 1% and 3%, administered for three weeks) in a rat model of acute amyloid beta (1-42) (Aβ1-42) toxicity. Rats were behaviorally tested (radial arm maze and Y-maze activities being used). Rats were divided into five groups (n = 5 / group): first group - vehicle, second group - Aβ1-42, the third and fourth group - PNO treatment groups (1% and 3%), and fifth group - donepezil group (as positive control, 5 mg/kg injected in Aβ1-42-treated rats). Antioxidant activity of the investigated essential oil was assessed using radical scavenging assays, such as 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS) tests. Also, biochemical estimations of the brain homogenates for acetylcholinesterase and oxidative stress biomarkers were carried out. The essential oil reversed the amyloid beta (1-42)-induced decreasing of the spontaneous alternation in the Y-maze test and the amyloid beta (1-42)-induced increasing of the working and reference memory errors in the radial arm maze test. The amyloid beta (1-42)-induced modification of the balance oxidant-antioxidant and acetylcholinesterase action in the hippocampus of the rat has been ameliorated using the essential oil. These findings suggested that Pinus halepensis essential oil has nootropic and neuroprotective activities and may be regarded as a therapeutic tool for attenuation of Aβ toxicity and neuronal dysfunction.","Hyperglycemia aggravates spinal cord injury through endoplasmic reticulum stress mediated neuronal apoptosis, gliosis and activation.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784940,Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,2019 03 23,"Hyperglycemia has been shown to influence prognostic outcome of spinal cord injury (SCI).

However, reduction in the level of GLP-1 is considered to be a major cause for the reduction of GLP-1-dependent insulin secretory response. Genistein an isoflavone, is an important polyphenol and has wide range of therapeutic potentials, but its therapeutic effects alone and/or in combination with metformin on GLP-1 secretion have not been investigated yet. Hence, we aimed to investigate the stimulatory action of genistein in combination with metformin on GLP-1 via downregulation of inflammatory mediators, hyperlipidemia and hyperglycemia in alloxan-induced diabetic rats. Diabetes was induced in experimental rats by single administration of alloxan intraperitoneally. Metformin (50 mg/kg/day), genistein (20 mg/kg/day) and combination of genistein and metformin was administered in alloxan-induced diabetic rats. We found that genistein alone and/or in combination with metformin significantly increased the serum level (P < 0.01) and tissue content (P < 0.05) of GLP-1 in intestine when compared with that of metformin-treated animals. Similarly, genistein alone and/or in combination with metformin also resulted in normoglycemia (P < 0.001), glucose tolerance (P < 0.01), insulin sensitivity (P < 0.0001), hyperlipidemia (P < 0.01), liver and kidney function biomarkers (P < 0.01) as compared to that of metformin-treated experimental animals. Moreover, genistein alone and/or in combination with metformin also downregulated the inflammatory responses by decreasing the levels of interleuin-6, tumor necrosis factor-α and C-reactive protein in serum (P < 0.05) and intestine (P < 0.001) more efficiently as compared to that of metformin-treated experimental animals. The downregulation of inflammatory responses in intestine, was positively associated with increased secretion of GLP-1 from intestine. Histopathology of pancreas and intestine also showed that genistein significantly improved the deleterious effects of alloxan on pancreas and intestine. Hence, our work provides new insights on the synergistic effects of genistein and metformin on GLP-1 secretion. This may significantly improve the perception for proposing new GLP-1-based synergistic approaches for the treatment of diabetes mellitus.",Citrus alkaline extracts prevent fibroblast senescence to ameliorate pulmonary fibrosis via activation of COX-2.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784938,Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,2019 03 23,"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive and ultimately fatal lung disease with a poor prognosis and limited treatment options. The incidence of IPF increases with age, and the mechanisms related to aging such as cellular senescence have been strongly implicated in disease pathology. Therefore, a better understanding of fibroblasts senescence might provide a new therapeutic strategy to prevent and treat pulmonary fibrosis. In this study, we aimed to explore the effects of citrus alkaline extracts (CAE) on the fibroblasts senescence, and elucidate the underlying mechanism to ameliorate pulmonary fibrosis. We demonstrated that CAE mitigated the collagen deposition by the initial early treatment, suggesting a potential preventive effect of CAE on pulmonary fibrosis. The expression of senescence biomarkers P16INK4a and P21, concomitant with down-regulation of the myofibroblasts marker α-SMA, and the number of senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-Gal) positive cells were decreased by CAE treatment, indicating a significant inhibitory effect of CAE on fibroblast senescence. Additionally, CAE down-regulated the expression of the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) in etoposide-induced senescent fibroblasts. Further studies indicated that COX-2 activation was required for CAE to inhibit the lung fibroblast senescence through a P53-dependent pathway. Results showed that the anti-senescence effect of CAE was abrogated when COX-2 was knocked down or inhibited by COX-2 inhibitor NS-398 or indomethacin in lung fibroblasts. Meanwhile, the anti-fibrotic and anti-senescence effect of CAE were abolished due to disruption of COX-2 in vivo. Collectively, our results provided a novel insight into the potential mechanism of CAE to inhibit the fibroblasts activation through preventing cellular senescence.",Swertiamarin decreases lipid accumulation dependent on 3-ketoacyl-coA thiolase.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784937,Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,2019 03 23,"Natural compounds are important resources for drug discovery. Using Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) models, we screened active natural compounds with lipid lowering effects. Swertiamarin was found as a potent candidate to reduce lipid content in C. elegans. Using RNAi screening, we were able to demonstrate that kat-1 (ketoacyl thiolase-1) is necessary for the lipid lowering effect of swertiamarin. Furthermore, the activity of swertiamarin was verified in high fat diet induced obese mice. Consistent with the results in C. elegans, swertiamarin ameliorated high fat diet induced lipid deposition and hyperlipidemia. These results indicate that swertiamarin exerts lipid-lowering effects through kat-1 regulation and could serve as a possible therapeutic option to improve hyperlipidemia induced comorbidities.",G protein-coupled estrogen receptor activation improves contractile and diastolic functions in rat renal interlobular artery to protect against renal ischemia reperfusion injury.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784936,Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,2019 03 23,"This work aimed to investigate whether G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) can improve the renal interlobular artery vascular function by increasing the NO content, thereby protecting against renal ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury.",miR-16 inhibits NLRP3 inflammasome activation by directly targeting TLR4 in acute lung injury.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784935,Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,2019 03 23,"Acute lung injury (ALI) is the leading cause of human death, and it is widely accepted that the runaway inflammation is an important risk for the development of ALI. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the effect of miR-16 on lipopolysaccharide-induced acute lung injury in mice, especially focusing on Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and NF-kB signaling pathway as well as NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation. We established in vivo and in vitro model of ALI using LPS and demonstrated that miR-16 expression was down-regulated in lung tissue as well as A549 cells after 8 h of LPS treatment. Furthermore, when miR-16 levels in lung tissues were up-regulated by miR-16 agomir, it was confirmed that the mRNA and protein levels of NF-κB, NLRP3 inflammasome, and inflammatory factors were decreased by the miR-16 by directly targeting TLR4. We also treated A549 cells with miR-16 mimics and anti-miR-16 to confirm the results. Overall, our experiments showed that miR-16 protects against acute lung injury in mice by regulating the TLR4/ NF-κB pathway and attenuating inflammatory response.

Therefore, the compounds that can mimic ER stress inhibitor may confer regulatory effects on ER stress induced apoptosis. In this study, we investigated the protective effects of flavonoid morin against ER stress induced apoptosis in human renal proximal tubular HK-2 cells. Morin downregulated the expression of GRP78, central regulator of ER stress response, induced by ER stress inducer tunicamycin. Interestingly, morin selectively inhibited the IRE1 pathway among the three major arms of the ER stress responses. The increased expression of XBP1-sp, phosphor-IRE-1α, and phosphor-JNK by TM were markedly suppressed by the pretreatment of morin. Morin also decreased the intracellular ROS production and the apoptosis induced by TM in HK-2 cells. Taken together, our finding show that morin acts as an ER stress inhibitor, and can be a good candidate in various ER-stress associated kidney diseases.",LINC00152 facilitates tumorigenesis in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma via miR-153-3p/FYN axis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784933,Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,2019 03 23,"Long non-coding RNAs (LncRNAs) have been found to be associated with the biological behaviors of human cancers. LINC00152 is reported as an oncogene in many kinds of malignancies. However, the functions and mechanisms of LINC00152 involved in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) remain elusive. Our results revealed that LINC00152 expression was up-regulated in ESCC, and correlated with advanced TNM stage, lymph node metastasis, and poor prognosis of ESCC patients. Functionally, LINC00152 knockdown suppressed proliferation, decreased colony forming ability, and induced apoptosis in ESCC cells. Mechanically, LINC00152 functioned as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) to sponge miR-153-3p, thereby facilitating its downstream target FYN. Moreover, miR-153-3p-mediated tumor-suppressive effects were partly reversed following LINC00152 overexpression. Also, FYN knockdown displayed a similar anti-cancerous role in ESCC cells. Taken together, LINC00152 contributed to ESCC progression by down-regulating miR-153-3p and promoting FYN expression, uncovering a novel LINC00152/miR-153-3p/FYN regulatory pathway in ESCC."

Here, miRNA-based on RNA-sequencing dataset revealed that miR-145 was significantly decreased in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) following LPS treatment. Bioinformatics, luciferase reporter and RNA immune co-precipitation (RIP) assays showed that miR-145 could directly target TGFBR2 and thus inactivated TGFBR2/Smad2 axis. On the contrary, luciferase reporter and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis showed that Smad2 could directly bind to DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1), the upregulation of which led to miR-145 promoter hypermethylation and downregulation of miR-145 expression, conversely promoting TGFBR2 expression. Notably, knockdown of TGFBR2 partially rescued the inhibition on miR-145 expression induced by LPS treatment. Additionally, we found that knockdown of TGFBR2 or overexpression of miR-145 attenuated LPS-induced sepsis and prolonged the overall survival of septic mice. Furthermore, TGFBR2 overexpression abrogated miR-145 overexpression-mediated attenuation on LPS-induced sepsis. Our results demonstrate the TGFBR2/SMAD2/DNMT1/miR-145 negative regulatory loop is responsible for LPS-induced sepsis.","Opuntioside, opuntiol and its metallic nanoparticles attenuate adjuvant-induced arthritis: Novel suppressors of Toll-like receptors -2 and -4.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784921,Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,2019 03 23,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease of synovial inflammation and joint destruction. This study reports anti-arthritic potential of opuntioside-I opuntiol, and its gold and silver nanoparticles (NPs) against Complete Freund's Adjuvant (CFA)-induced arthritic rats. The mechanistic studies were performed targeting TLRs (TLR-2 and TLR-4) and cytokines (IL-1β and TNF-α) expressions to validate their anti-inflammatory and immuno-modulatory response. The nano-formulations were successfully characterized employing Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) and Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) analysis. Opuntiol and opuntioside (OP and OPG: 10, 50 and 100 mg/kg) and opuntiol-coated silver and gold NPs (OP-AgNPs and OP-AuNPs: 0.5, 1 and 3 mg/kg) treatments in arthritic rat have shown minimal arthritic score exhibiting mild to moderate articular changes and tissue swelling in ankle joints. Radiographic examination reveals significant reduction in synovitis with improvement in joints degenarative changes in the presence of aforementioned treatments. Likewise, histology of rat ankle joints depicted comparatively lesser influx of inflammatory cells and diminished granulamatous inflammation. Moreover, treatment groups suppressed protein and mRNA expressions of TLRs (TLR-2 and TLR-4) and cytokines (IL-1β and TNF-α) levels were also significantly declined in the presence of OPG, OP and its NPs comparing to arthritic control. This investigation concludes, the tested compounds and nano-formulations successfully restored the disease progression in CFA-induced arthritic rat owing to their immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory potentials and can be considered for RA targeted therapy to address the utmost challenges of the disease.",Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells suppress growth and promote the apoptosis of glioma U251 cells through downregulation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784920,Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,2019 03 23,"Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), with the capacity for self-renewal and differentiation into multiple cell types, exhibit the property of homing towards tumor sites and immunosuppression and have been used as tumor-tropic vectors for tumor therapy. However, few studies have investigated the underlying molecular mechanisms that link MSCs to targeted tumor cells. In this study, we elucidated the inhibitory effects and mechanisms of human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hBMSCs) on human glioma U251 cells using a co-culture system in vitro. The anti-tumor activity of co-cultured hBMSCs was assessed by morphological changes, the MTT assay, and Hoechst 33258 staining. Cell apoptosis and cell cycle distribution were evaluated by flow cytometry. Cell migration and invasion were evaluated using a 24-well Transwell chamber. A proteomics approach was used to identify differentially expressed proteins after hBMSCs treatment in U251 cells, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to validate the results. Bioinformatics analyses were also implemented to better understand the identified proteins, and Western blotting analyses were used to analyze the associated proteins. The results showed that hBMSCs could inhibit cell proliferation and induce cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase, resulting in apoptosis of U251 cells. Transwell and Matrigel invasion assays showed that hBMSCs reduced the migration and invasion of U251 cells. Using proteomics, 11 differentially expressed proteins were identified and observed. Bioinformatics analyses indicated that the identified proteins participated in several biological processes and exhibited various molecular functions, mainly related to the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/AKT) pathway. Moreover, hBMSCs regulated changes in proteins linked to cell apoptosis and cell cycle progression and inhibited the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-like and PI3K/AKT pathway. Taken together, the findings in our study suggest that hBMSCs inhibit U251 cells proliferation and the EMT-like by downregulating the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, which indicates that hBMSCs have a potential antitumor characteristics and should be further explored in future glioma therapy.","Mechanistic insight into diabetic wounds: Pathogenesis, molecular targets and treatment strategies to pace wound healing.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784919,Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,2019 03 23,"Wound management in diabetic patient is of an extreme clinical and social concern.

Many strategies of cancer treatment such as chemotherapy are developed and used nowadays. However, for the cancer chemotherapy resistance, reduction of the limitation of cancer chemotherapy efficacy is one of the aims of several oncology teams. Moreover, the cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6-cyclin D-retinoblastoma protein-E2F pathway is an important mechanism for cell cycle control and its dysregulation is one of the key factors for cancers development including cervical cancer. Ribociclib is one of the selective CDK4/6 inhibitors and is a new therapeutic approach showing promise as a good strategy of therapy in many human cancers. However, there are not the studies regarding the investigation of effects of Ribociclib in cervical cancer yet. In the present study, by western blotting and immunofluorescence assay, we found respectively that CDK4, CDK6 and cyclin D1 are highly expressed and are mostly localized in the nucleus with some localized in the cytoplasm of cervical cancer cell lines. Moreover, Ribociclib induced cell cycle arrest in G0-G1 phase and cell apoptosis, and inhibited C33A cell proliferation in dose - dependent manner following by decreased expression of certain related genes such as CDK4, CDK6, E2F1, P-Rb, and increased Bax expression. In C33A xenografts, Ribociclib inhibited tumor growth associated with decreased expressions of CDK4, CDK6, cyclin D1, Rb and Ki-67, and also significantly increased tumor cell apoptosis.

Here, we focused on potential differences between early follicular and midluteal phases in the way women process images of behaviorally relevant content categories: children, threat, disgust, erotic scenes, low- and high-calorie food. Using eye-tracking, we examined women's engagement of attention in the key region of each image in a free-viewing condition. Specifically, we tested how quickly attention was attracted to these regions and for how long it was held there. Participants took part in two experimental sessions, one in the early follicular and one in the midluteal phase. The results showed that in the midluteal phase attention was attracted to the key region earlier than in the early follicular phase: the first fixation more often fell within the key region and there were fewer fixations preceding it. While the effect of the phase in terms of the capture of attention did not depend on the image category, the effect regarding the hold of attention was category-specific, concerning the disgust category only. Specifically, in the midluteal phase the duration of the exploration of the key region between reaching it for the first time and first exiting it was shorter, which might be due to heightened sensitivity to disgusting stimuli in this period. Overall, our results indicate the occurrence of changes in attentional processing of emotional scenes related to the menstrual cycle, which seem to differ depending on the aspect of attention deployment: in the midluteal phase the effect of enhancing orienting was general and concerned any important visual information, whereas the effect of the shortened hold of attention appeared to be limited to specific content.",The role of epigenetic aging in education and racial/ethnic mortality disparities among older U.S. Women.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784901,Psychoneuroendocrinology,2019 06 10,"Higher mortality experienced by socially disadvantaged groups and/or racial/ethnic minorities is hypothesized to be, at least in part, due to an acceleration of the aging process.

In this study, 51 students encoded a list of neutral, positive, and negative words as well as two neutral, biographical notes one day before attendance at a seminar at the university. In the stress condition, students gave a graded oral presentation, whereas they just attended the same seminar in the control condition immediately before retrieval took place. Measures of state anxiety, salivary cortisol and alpha-amylase confirmed the oral presentation to constitute a potent stressor. Importantly, stress significantly impaired retrieval of negative words, but not retrieval of the biographical notes. These results indicate that a real-life stressor decreases memory retrieval for negative items. In contrast, delayed memory retrieval of neutral information and interrelated details of biographical notes seems to be less prone to stress effects. These results have critical implications for educational settings.",Adipokine expression in systemic sclerosis lung and gastrointestinal organ involvement.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784899,Cytokine,2019 05 12,"The immunomodulatory properties of adipokines have previously been reported in autoimmune disorders.

This is mediated both by direct cytotoxic mechanisms and by production of immunoregulatory cytokines. Recent evidence has shown that NK cells also display memory, similar to the cells of the adaptive immune system. Cytokines are pivotal for the maturation, activation and survival of NK cells. Interleukins (IL)-2, IL-12, IL-15, IL-18, IL-21 and type I interferons positively regulate NK cell function, either independently or in cooperation, whereas other cytokines, such as IL-23 and IL-27, may enhance or suppress NK cell function depending on the context. In the tumor microenvironment, TGFβ, IL-10 and IL-6 suppress NK cell activity not only directly, but also indirectly, by affecting immunosuppressive cells and by antagonizing the effect of stimulatory cytokines, thereby dampening the antitumor response of NK cells and promoting subsequent tumor evasion and progression. Increased understanding of the NK cell response to cytokines has provided a better understanding of their impaired function in tumors which may aid in the development of novel immunotherapeutic strategies to enhance NK cell responses in cancer patients.",Tailoring the immune response to wheat gliadin by enzymatic transamidation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784897,Cytokine,2019 05 12,"Enzymatic transamidation of wheat gliadin by microbial transglutaminase inhibits IFN-γ secretion by intestinal T cell lines from celiac disease (CD) patients. Here, we analysed its effects on intestinal biopsies from CD patients and studied the underlying mechanisms in HLA-DQ8 transgenic (tg) mice, a model of T-cell mediated gluten sensitivity. In vitro challenge with a soluble form of transamidated gliadin (spf) upregulated IL-10 transcript levels in human biopsy samples. Furthermore, the ratio of IL-10/IFN-γ transcripts was significantly increased following treatment with spf. In DQ8 tg mice, recall responses in vitro in the presence of dendritic cells pulsed with transamidated gliadin showed that gliadin-specific CD4+ T cells did not produce IFN-γ at any tested dose. On the contrary, spf-specific CD4+ T cells still secreted IFN-γ, but they also produced significant levels of IL-10 with both native and transamidated gliadin. Interestingly, this anti-inflammatory activity was restricted to a specific reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) fraction encompassing α-gliadins. These findings suggested an ability of transamidated gliadin to revert, as well as to prevent, the inflammatory phenotype triggered by native gliadin. This property was intrinsically associated with specific components of the α-gliadin fraction.",The effects of hyperglycemia on outcomes in surgical high-grade glioma patients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784896,Clinical neurology and neurosurgery,2019 03 16,To define the glucose values associated with an increase in complication rates in post-operative brain tumor patients.,"The impact of BMI on operating room time, blood loss, and hospital stay in patients undergoing spinal fusion.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784895,Clinical neurology and neurosurgery,2019 03 16,"Obesity affects not only the health of an individual but society as a whole and especially the healthcare system.

We tested individuals with FAI to determine if they have reduced ability to control ankle muscle forces, which is a function of force sense. Our test was performed isometrically to minimize the involvement of joint position sense and kinesthesia. A FAI group and a control group were recruited to perform an ankle force control task using a platform-based ankle robot. They were asked to move a cursor to hit 24 targets as accurately and as fast as possible in a virtual maze. The cursor movement was based on the direction and magnitude of the forces applied to the robot. Participants underwent three conditions: pre-test (baseline), practice (skill acquisition), and post-test (post skill acquisition). The force control ability was quantified based on the accuracy performance during the task. The accuracy performance was negatively associated with the collision count of the cursor with the maze wall. The FAI group showed reduced ability to control ankle muscle forces compared to the control group in the pre-test condition, but the difference became non-significant in the post-test condition after practice. The change in performance before and after practice may be due to different degrees of reliance on force sense."

However, there are few studies on the potential of nanodelivery system to promote the immunogenic cell death as a cancer vaccine. We reported here that cRGD target liposome delivery system was capable to promote the immunogenic cell death through enhanced potency of a thymidine conjugate post UVA activation as a cancer vaccine. Liposomes and cRGD target liposomes were found to significantly increase the cellular accumulation of the thymidine conjugate and subsequently translated into enhanced cytotoxic potency after UVA activation. More importantly, cRGD target liposomes of the thymidine conjugate markedly promoted the early detection of immunogenic cell death markers including ATP, HMGB1 and calreticulin. Subsequent in vivo vaccination-challenge study confirmed effective tumor growth inhibition by the cRGD liposomal thymidine conjugate and UVA treated cancer cells as the cancer vaccine. In addition, liposomes and cRGD target liposomes alone did not shown any induction of the immunogenic cell death markers, revealing the adjuvant nature of the nanodelivery system.","Design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of truncated deguelin derivatives as Hsp90 inhibitors.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784881,European journal of medicinal chemistry,2019 04 18,"A series of novel B and C-rings truncated deguelin derivatives have been designed and synthesized in the present study as heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) inhibitors.

Their structure-activity relationships (SARs) were investigated in a systematic manner. Compound 21c was identified to have high Hsp90 binding potency (60 nM) and caused degradation of client proteins through ubiquitin proteasome system. Further biological studies showed that compound 21c induced a dose-dependent S and G2-phase cell cycle arrest on human breast cancer MCF-7 cells. Flow cytometry and Western blot analyses confirmed that compound 21c caused apoptosis of MCF-7 cells. In addition, compound 21c showed much potent inhibition on the migration and invasion of MCF-7 cells. Taken together, these results suggest that 21c might be a promising lead compound for further development of Hsp90 inhibitors.","Chemical synthesis, crystal structure, versatile evaluation of their biological activities and molecular simulations of novel pyrithiobac derivatives.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784880,European journal of medicinal chemistry,2019 04 18,"Since pyrithiobac (PTB) is a successful commercial herbicide with very low toxicity against mammals, it is worth exploring its derivatives for an extensive study. Herein, a total of 35 novel compounds were chemically synthesized and single crystal of 6-6 was obtained to confirm the molecular structure of this family of compounds. The novel PTB derivatives were fully evaluated against various biological platforms. From the bioassay results, the best AHAS inhibitor 6-22 displayed weaker herbicidal activity but stronger anti-Candida activity than PTB did. For plant pathogenic fungi, 6-26 showed excellent activity at 50 mg/L dosage. Preliminary insecticidal activity and antiviral activity were also observed for some title compounds. Strikingly, 6-5 exhibited a promising inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV Mpro with IC50 of 4.471 μM and a low cellular cytotoxicity against mammalian 293 T cells. Based on the results of molecular modeling, HOMO-1 was considered to be a factor that affects AHAS inhibition and a possible binding mode of 6-5 with SARS-CoV Mpro was predicted. This is the first time that PTB derivatives have been studied as biological agents other than herbicides. The present research hence has suggested that more attentions should be paid to compounds belonging to this family to develop novel agrochemicals or medicines.","Efficient click chemistry towards novel 1H-1,2,3-triazole-tethered 4H-chromene-d-glucose conjugates: Design, synthesis and evaluation of in vitro antibacterial, MRSA and antifungal activities.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784879,European journal of medicinal chemistry,2019 04 18,"The series of 2-amino-7-propargyloxy-4H-chromene-3-carbonitriles 5a-t were synthesized from corresponding 2-amino-7-phydroxy-4H-chromene-3-carbonitriles 4a-t and propargyl bromide.

While HO-2 is constitutively expressed, HO-1 is strongly overexpressed under stressful stimuli (e.g., oxidative stress). Under these conditions, HO-1 exerts its strong cytoprotective activities and plays a crucial role in stimulating cell survival by removing the pro-oxidant heme and by producing carbon monoxide and biliverdin (promptly reduced to bilirubin). Unfortunately, the broad spectrum of HO-1 cytoprotective effects has been well experimentally documented both in normal and tumor cells, where the enzyme can be overexpressed, making it an exciting target in the management of some type of tumors. Development of non-competitive HO-1 inhibitors dates back in 2002 with the discovery of Azalanstat. Since then, many efforts have been devoted to the identification of selective HO-1 and HO-2 inhibitors and to unravel the molecular determinants responsible for selectivity. Molecular modeling studies supported the identification of chemical features involved in the recognition and inhibition of these enzymes. Herein, medicinal chemistry aspects and in silico studies related to the development of HO inhibitors will be discussed. The purpose of this review is to highlight recent advances in the development of new selective HO-1 and HO-2 inhibitors and covers the last six years (2013-2018).",A fragment-based approach towards the discovery of N-substituted tropinones as inhibitors of Mycobacterium tuberculosis transcriptional regulator EthR2.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784877,European journal of medicinal chemistry,2019 04 18,"Tuberculosis (TB) caused by the pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis, represents one of the most challenging threat to public health worldwide, and with the increasing resistance to approved TB drugs, it is needed to develop new strategies to address this issue. Ethionamide is one of the most widely used drugs for the treatment of multidrug-resistant TB. It is a prodrug that requires activation by mycobacterial monooxygenases to inhibit the enoyl-ACP reductase InhA, which is involved in mycolic acid biosynthesis. Very recently, we identified that inhibition of a transcriptional repressor, termed EthR2, derepresses a new bioactivation pathway that results in the boosting of ethionamide activation. Herein, we describe the identification of potent EthR2 inhibitors using fragment-based screening and structure-based optimization. A target-based screening of a fragment library using thermal shift assay followed by X-ray crystallography identified 5 hits. Rapid optimization of the tropinone chemical series led to compounds with improved in vitro potency.","Novel prenyloxy chalcones as potential leishmanicidal and trypanocidal agents: Design, synthesis and evaluation.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784876,European journal of medicinal chemistry,2019 04 18,"The available drugs for treating Leishmaniasis and American trypanosomiasis have high toxicity and multiple side effects, among other problems. More effective and less toxic treatments are urgently needed. A series of chalcones that contained a prenyloxy or geranyloxy substituent was synthesized and characterized. Each substituent was attached to the A ring in some compounds and to the B ring in others, with additional substituents placed on the chalcone moiety. The present aim was to evaluate the effect of the substitution pattern on leishmanicidal and trypanocidal activity. When tested at a single concentration, the compounds exerting a metabolic inhibition close to or exceeding 50% for Leishmania mexicana were 11, 17 and 12, and for Trypanosoma cruzi were 11, 17, 15 and 26. Upon determining the selectivity index (SI =IC50/CC50), the values were 80.9, 1.24 and 55.12 for 11, 17 and 12 (respectively) versus L. mexicana, and 75.1, 1.43, 27.36 and 33.52 for 11, 17, 15 and 26 (respectively) versus T. cruzi. Structural isomers 11 and 17 showed activity for both the L. mexicana and T. cruzi strains, though the greater cytotoxic activity of 17 led to a lower SI. Compounds 12, 15 and 26 were species specific. For T. cruzi, the SI was higher for 11, 15 and 26 than for the reference drugs nifurtimox and benznidazole. The examination of promastigote morphology after exposing L. mexicana and T. cruzi to 11 revealed a decrease in cell density.

The NSAID-Pt(IV) prodrugs, especially Eto-Pt(IV), highly enhanced cellular uptake with amount up to 42-fold at 3 h compared with CDDP, and greatly increased DNA damage and cell apoptosis, showing much higher cytotoxicity than cisplatin in the tested cancer cells even in A549/cis cells. Among of them, Eto-Pt(IV) and Car-Pt(IV) exhibited more excellent activity than Sul-Pt(IV), arising from their reduction-labile and favorable lipophilicity. Most strikingly, Eto-Pt(IV) markedly inhibited metastasis and invasion of MCF-7 cells, owing to its COX-2 suppression that down-regulated active MMP-2, vimentin protein and up-regulated E-cadherin.

From the most primitive activated carbon to the most innovative modified biochar, carbon-based materials have played a significant role in the adsorption process of antibiotics all the time. This paper reviews the adsorption behavior of some representative antibiotics (e.g., chloramphenicols, sulfonamides, tetracyclines, flouroquinolones) over various carbonaceous materials (i.e., activated carbon, carbon nanotubes, graphene, and biochar). Nevertheless, in addition to the structural characteristics and adsorption capacities of carbon-based materials, a special emphasis was placed on the underlying adsorption mechanisms and roles of different influencing factors in the adsorption process.

A three-step treatment consisting of an initial thermal treatment, oxidation treatment, and further thermal treatment increased the amount of surface hydroxyl groups (COH) of AC while reducing the amounts of other surface groups, such as basic, carboxyl, lactone, and carbonyl groups. The obtained ACN2O2N2 shows better catalytic performance for HA ozonation than virgin AC, and the COD removal improved from 71% to 96% after reacting for 10 min. This modification method could also restore the catalytic activity of used ACN2O2N2, as the COD removal improved from 74% to 97% after reacting 10 min. The apparent first-order rate constant (kapp) was obtained by fitting the evolution of TOC. The regression analyses of the relationships between the kapp and the surface chemical properties, textural properties, and degree of AC graphitization showed that the increase in the amount of COH was the main factor driving the enhancement and restoration of the AC catalyst activity.",Antifungal activities of combined treatments of irradiation and essential oils (EOs) encapsulated chitosan nanocomposite films in in vitro and in situ conditions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784857,International journal of food microbiology,2019 04 19,"Cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) reinforced chitosan based antifungal films were prepared by encapsulating essential oils (EOs) nanoemulsion. Vapor phase assays of the chitosan-based nanocomposite films loaded with thyme-oregano, thyme-tea tree and thyme-peppermint EO mixtures showed significant antifungal activity against Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus parasiticus, and Penicillium chrysogenum, reducing their growth by 51-77%. Combining the bioactive chitosan films loaded with thyme and oregano EOs produced ~2 log reduction in fungal growth in inoculated rice during 8 weeks of storage at 28 °C. The bioactive films showed a slow release (26%) of volatile components over 12 weeks of storage. Sensorial evaluation of rice samples packed with the bioactive films showed no significant change in odor, taste, color and general appreciation compared with untreated rice. Incorporation of cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) with the chitosan matrix played an important role in stabilizing the physicochemical and release properties of the nanocomposite films. In addition, combining the bioactive chitosan films with a dose of 750 Gy of ionizing radiation showed significantly higher antifungal and mechanical properties than treatment with the bioactive film or irradiation alone.",Antimicrobial effect of nisin electrospun amaranth: pullulan nanofibers in apple juice and fresh cheese.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784856,International journal of food microbiology,2019 04 19,"Nisin-loaded amaranth protein isolate:pullulan (API:PUL) nanofibers were prepared by the electrospinning method. The nisin release kinetic was evaluated at pH 3.4 and 6.1 and the antimicrobial effectiveness of the electrospun mats was evaluated in apple juice and fresh cheese. The nisin API:PUL fibers with 120 nm average diameter reached 81.49% and 43.85% nisin release after 12 h at pH 3.4 and 6.1, respectively. The encapsulation of nisin in electrospun fibers allowed complete bactericidal activity against Salmonella Typhimurium, L. monocytogenes and L. mesenteroides inoculated in apple juice after 48, 20 and 48 h, respectively. When nisin API:PUL fibers were applied to fresh cheese, microorganism inactivation was complete after 142, 120 and 170 h, respectively. The results demonstrated that nisin API:PUL electrospun fibers significantly reduce the bacterial population and can be used in food products for microbiological safety.","Evaluation of the efficiency of allspice, thyme and rosemary essential oils on two foodborne pathogens in in-vitro and on alfalfa seeds, and their effect on sensory characteristics of the sprouts.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784855,International journal of food microbiology,2019 04 19,"Seeds are usual source of contamination and their sprouts are commonly associated foodborne illness. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the antibacterial vapor phase efficiency of allspice, thyme and rosemary essential oils on two foodborne pathogens in in vitro and on alfalfa seeds, including the chemical profile of the tested EOs and their effect on the sensory characteristics of the sprouts. Antibacterial activity was determined through the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of EOs in vapor phase to inhibit the growth of Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella Typhimurium in culture media and on alfalfa seeds. Also, the germination and the effect on sensory characteristics of the sprouts were determined. Thyme EO was the most effective of the tested EOs on culture media and on alfalfa seeds, against both bacteria. When rosemary EO was tested against L. monocytogenes in alfalfa seeds, the MIC (4.0 mL/Lair) was higher, compared to the one obtained in culture media (2.7 mL/Lair). But when this EO was tested against S. Typhimurium, the MIC in alfalfa seeds was lower than in culture media (11.7 vs 13.3 mL/Lair). Allspice EO resulted more effective against both bacteria in alfalfa seeds (6.0 mL/Lair for L. monocytogenes and 6.7 mL/Lair for S. Typhimurium), compared to culture media (12.0 mL/Lair for L. monocytogenes and 13.3 mL/Lair for S. Typhimurium). Vapor phase EOs MICs resulted in significant (p ≤ 0.05) decreases of L. monocytogenes and S. Typhimurium counts compared to the control. There also was a significant (p ≤ 0.05) difference between systems (in vitro or on alfalfa seeds) despite the microorganism or the evaluated EO. Treatment alfalfa seed with vapor phase EOs, did not affect the seed germination.

Cognitive processes underlying memory errors in older adults remain unclear. Here, in a categorized pictures paradigm, we used the event-related potential (ERP) to examine the electrophysiological correlates of false recognition. Young and older participants were presented with categorized pictures during study and subsequently completed an old/new recognition memory task that included studied pictures, lure pictures from studied categories, and new pictures. Behavioral results showed proportionally similar but higher-confidence false memories in older adults compared to young adults. ERP results revealed that false recognition elicited a significant early frontal old/new effect indexing familiarity in young adults, while older adults exhibited a reliable late posterior negativity during false recognition.

Oriental river prawn (Macrobrachium nipponense) is one of the most economically important shrimps in China. This species can live in freshwater and low-salt water, but the molecular mechanism of salinity regulation is unclear. In this study, full-length cDNAs of M. nipponense α-NKA and CA were obtained by rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE)-PCR (GenBank accession numbers MH378774 and MH827971, respectively), and characterised. Full-length cDNAs of Mnα-NKA (3778bp) and MnCA (1407bp) contain open reading frames of 3030bp and 930bp, respectively, encoding polypeptides of 1009 and 930 amino acids. Bioinformatic analysis showed that Mnα-NKA and MnCA harbour the representative features of NKAs and CAs, and share high homology with orthologs in other crustaceans. Quantitative real-time PCR revealed that Mnα-NKA and MnCA were expressed in various tissues, with highest expression in posterior gills and hepatopancreas. Both Mnα-NKA and MnCA were up-regulated in response to salinity acclimation, but expression patterns differed. Our results provide a theoretical basis for the mechanism regulating salinity acclimation in M. nipponense."

As the most remote regions of the globe, the occurrence of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in these polar regions arouses global concern. In this paper, we review the literatures on POPs involving these three polar regions. Overall, concentrations of POPs in the environment (air, water, soil and biota) have been extensively reported, with higher levels of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) detected on the Tibetan Plateau. The spatial distribution of POPs in air, water and soil in the three polar regions broadly reflects their distances away from source regions. Based on long-term data, decreasing trends have been observed for most ""legacy POPs"". Observations of transport processes of POPs among multiple media have also been carried out, including air-water gas exchange, air-soil gas exchange, emissions from melting glaciers, bioaccumulations along food chains, and exposure risks. The impact of climate change on these processes possibly enhances the re-emission processes of POPs out of water, soil and glaciers, and reduces the bioaccumulation of POPs in food chains. Global POPs transport model have shown the Arctic receives a relatively small fraction of POPs, but that climate change will likely increase the total mass of all compounds in this polar region. Considering the impact of climate change on POPs is still unclear, long-term monitoring data and global/regional models are required, especially in the Antarctic and on the Tibetan Plateau, and the fate of POPs in all three polar regions needs to be comprehensively studied and compared to yield a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in the global cycling of POPs.",Isotopic evaluation on relative contributions of major NOx sources to nitrate of PM2.5 in Beijing.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784837,"Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)",2019 05 14,"Nitrate (NO3-) is a key component of secondary inorganic aerosols and PM2.5. However, the contributions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) emission sources to NO3- in PM2.5 remain poorly constrained. This study measured nitrogen (N) isotopes of NO3- (hereafter as δ15N-NO3-) in PM2.5 collected at Beijing in 2014. We observed that δ15N-NO3- values in PM2.5 (-2.3‰ - 19.7‰; 7.3 ± 5.4‰ annually) were significantly higher in winter (11.9 ± 4.4‰) than in summer (2.2 ± 2.5‰). The δ15N differences between source NOx and NO3- in PM2.5 (hereafter as Δ values) were estimated by a computation module as 7.8 ± 2.2‰ - 10.4 ± 1.6‰ (8.8 ± 2.4‰). Using the Δ values and δ15N values of NOx from major fossil (coal combustion, vehicle exhausts) and non-fossil sources (biomass burning, microbial N cycle), contributions of major NOx sources to NO3- in PM2.5 were further estimated by the SIAR model. We found that seasonal variations of δ15N-NO3- values in PM2.5 of Beijing were mainly caused by those of NOx contributions from coal combustion (38 ± 10% in winter, 20 ± 9% in summer). Annually, NOx from coal combustion, vehicle exhausts, biomass burning, and microbial N cycle contributed 28 ± 12%, 29 ± 17%, 27 ± 15%, and 16 ± 7% to NO3- in PM2.5, respectively, showing actually comparable contributions between non-fossil NOx (43 ± 16%) and fossil NOx (57 ± 21%). These results are useful for planning the reduction of NOx emissions in city environments and for elucidating relationships between regional NOx emissions and atmospheric NO3- pollution or deposition.","Perfluoroalkyl acids in paired serum, urine, and hair samples: Correlations with demographic factors and dietary habits.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784836,"Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)",2019 05 14,"We analyzed paired serum, urine, and hair samples from 94 Korean children and adults to investigate levels of 11 perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs). The effects of demographic factors and dietary habits on PFAA exposure were also assessed based on the paired samples. The total PFAA concentrations were 2.4-31 ng/mL in serum, not detected-9.5 ng/mL in urine, and 0.48-15 ng/g in hair. Levels of perfluoropentanoic acid (PFPeA) and perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA), which have short carbon chains, were 1.5-5 fold higher in urine and hair than in serum. The PFAA concentrations in serum exhibited a decreasing trend with age from young childhood to adolescence, followed by an increasing trend after adolescence. For most PFAA species, concentrations in serum were higher in adult males than in adult females (p < 0.01). No sex difference was evident in the urine and hair samples. In addition, there was no age difference in the urine samples, but in the hair samples, we observed higher concentrations of PFAAs in children than in the other age groups (p < 0.01). The consumption rates of fish and water showed significant correlations with serum (positive correlation) and hair (negative) concentrations, respectively. No relationships between serum and hair/urine levels for most PFAAs were observed, except between serum and hair levels for perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA).",Source apportionment of rainwater chemical composition to investigate the transport of lower atmospheric pollutants to the UTLS region.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784835,"Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)",2019 05 14,"Efforts to understand the chemical composition of Asian Tropopause Aerosol Layer (ATAL) in the Upper Troposphere Lower Stratosphere (UTLS) region have revealed the dominance of nitrates in the samples collected from ATAL layer during the recent balloon campaigns. Potential sources have been thought to be in-situ formation, convective uplift and long-range transport. Rainwater chemical composition consists water-soluble chemical ions that are wet scavenged during rain events and gives an indirect indication of lower atmospheric pollutants. Keeping this in focus, total monsoon precipitation chemistry at Gadanki (13.5°N, 79.2°E) has been studied to understand the convective uplift possibilities to the UTLS region. About 32 rainwater samples collected during July to December 2017 were analysed for their chemical composition using Ion Chromatography. Total 16 ions comprising of 5 anions (F-, Cl-, NO3-, SO42- and PO43-), 6 cations (Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Li+ and NH4+) and 5 trace metals (Cd2+, Ni2+, Co2+, Mn2+ and Zn2+) have been detected in different rainwater samples. Rainwater chemical composition data has been subjected to the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to understand the correlations between different chemical species and to identify the possible sources of origin qualitatively. It has been observed that the chemical composition of the rainwater is very different from the chemical composition of the ATAL layer indicating non-existence of convective transport of lower level pollutants to the UTLS region at Gadanki. This observation is also well supported by the vertical distribution of CALIPSO derived aerosol types and ERA interim vertical pressure velocities during the sampling period.",Scavenging as a pathway for plastic ingestion by marine animals.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784834,"Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)",2019 05 14,"Plastic pollution is prevalent worldwide and affects marine wildlife from urbanized beaches to pristine oceanic islands. However, the ecological basis and mechanisms that result in marine animal ingestion of plastic debris are still relatively unknown, despite recent advances. We investigated the relationship between scavenging behavior and plastic ingestion using green turtles, Chelonia mydas, as a model. Diet analysis of C. mydas showed that sea turtles engaging in scavenging behavior ingested significantly more plastic debris than individuals that did not engage in this foraging strategy. We argue that opportunistic scavenging behavior, an adaptive behavior in most marine ecosystems, may now pose a threat to a variety of marine animals due to the current widespread plastic pollution found in oceans.",Organic molecular markers in marine aerosols over the Western Mediterranean Sea.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784833,"Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)",2019 05 14,"A scientific campaign was undertaken along the Western sector of the Mediterranean Sea in the summer 2015 (26th Jun to 13th Jul), with the goal of gathering information about organic contaminants affecting marine aerosol over the Italian seas and with a special focus on changes in composition due to sources. 24 PM10 atmospheric samples in total were chemically characterized, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), aliphatic hydrocarbons (n-alkanes) and phthalate esters. Contemporarily, regulated gaseous toxicants (i.e. ozone, nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide) and meteorological parameters were recorded. Samplings were carried out inshore in front of harbors (N = 7) and along the cruise, both during the vessel shipping (N = 11, transects) and at its stops offshore (N = 6). Total PAH concentrations ranged from 0.03 to 1.94 ng/m3 and raised close to harbors and coastal sites, confirming that continental sources were responsible for the strong increase of pollution levels there compared to offshore. The percent composition and diagnostic ratio rates of PAHs were different for harbors, while transects were in agreement with offshore stops, possibly due to the different impact of pollution sources. n-Alkanes (C21C38) and the corresponding carbon preference index rates (CPI) were assessed; their values ranged 8.7-90 ng/m3 and 1.1-2.9 respectively, which suggested that fossil fuel combustion was the dominant source, though biogenic emission could contribute. Alkyl phthalates revealed wide variability in concentrations among aerosol samples. Moreover, long-range atmospheric transport and particle ageing effect induced by photo-oxidants were important factors controlling the composition of organic aerosols in the Mediterranean Sea air.",Spatial and temporal risk quotient based river assessment for water resources management.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784832,"Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)",2019 05 14,"Malaysia depends heavily on rivers as a source for water supply, irrigation, and sustaining the livelihood of local communities. The evolution of land use in urban areas due to rapid development and the continuous problem of illegal discharge have had a serious adverse impact on the health of the country's waterways. Klang River requires extensive rehabilitation and remediation before its water could be utilised for a variety of purposes. A reliable and rigorous remediation work plan is needed to identify the sources and locations of streams that are constantly polluted. This study attempts to investigate the feasibility of utilising a temporal and spatial risk quotient (RQ) based analysis to make an accurate assessment of the current condition of the tributaries in the Klang River catchment area. The study relies on existing data sets on Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD), Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), Total Suspended Solids (TSS), and Ammonia (NH3) to evaluate the water quality at thirty strategic locations. Analysis of ammonia pollution is not only based on the limit established for river health but was expanded to include the feasibility of using the water for water intake, recreational activities, and sustaining fish population. The temporal health of Klang River was evaluated using the Risk Matrix Approach (RMA) based on the frequency of RQ > 1 and associated colour-coded hazard impacts. By using the developed RMA, the hazard level for each parameter at each location was assessed and individually mapped using Geographic Information System (GIS).

In the present study, C57BL/6 mice (adult (4-month) and middle-aged (10-month)) were given 3 mg/kg PM2.5 every other day by oropharyngeal aspiration for 4 weeks, and then, body and cardiac parameter, containing weight data, cardiac function, ultrastructure, metabolic analysis, and molecular detection were conducted to investigate the PM2.5-induced cardiotoxicity. The results indicated that middle-aged mice were more susceptible to PM2.5, displaying slow cardiac growth, cardiac dysfunction, abnormal mitochondrial structure and function, and cardiac metabolic disorders. The altered metabolites were enriched in carbohydrate metabolism, fatty acid metabolism, amino acid metabolism, nucleotide metabolism and nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism. In conclusion, we speculated that the cardiac metabolic disorders may be important factors in PM2.5-induced cardiac dysfunction and mitochondrial structure destruction in middle-aged mice, providing a new direction for the study of the association between PM2.5 and CVDs."

However, even in species-rich ecosystems, functional over-redundancy (FOR; i.e., the tendency of most species to cluster into a few over-represented functional entities) in some cases may result in under-representation of many functions, and the ecosystem might become highly vulnerable. Using a stratified random sampling design with nested spatial levels (nine land use strata, 70 plots, 435 trees/rock outcrops, and 9845 quadrats), we recorded the occurrence of over 350 species of epiphytic and rock-dwelling lichens in semi-arid ecosystems in western Sardinia, where solar radiation defines a wide environmental gradient. By accounting for species functional traits, such as growth form, photosynthetic strategies, and reproductive strategies, we obtained 43 functional entities (>60% of all possible combinations) and tested the scale-dependency of FOR and functional vulnerability (FV, i.e., the risk of losing functional entities) by generalized linear mixed models. We found that FOR increased and FV decreased with increasing spatial scale, which supports the hypothesis of a cross-scale functional reinforcement. Decoupling of FOR and FV was far more evident for rock-dwelling compared with epiphytic communities, which reflects differing environmental conditions associated with substrate type. Our results indicate that increased warming and climatic extremes could exacerbate species clustering into the most resistant functional entities and thus enhance FOR at the community level. Therefore, high taxonomic diversity may not ensure systematic buffering of climate change impacts.","Response of agricultural multifunctionality to farmland loss under rapidly urbanizing processes in Yangtze River Delta, China.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784817,The Science of the total environment,2019 04 11,"Agricultural multifunctionality is increasing interest and importance under the environmental change, which influences the sustainability of agricultural systems. However, research on how the agricultural multifunctionality is being temporally adjusted under the process of rapid urbanization remains limited. Here, we use the Yangtze River Delta, one of the newest metropolitan agglomerations globally, as study area to investigate the threats of modern urbanization to traditional agriculture. This study assessed changes to farmland area and the agricultural multifunctionality of 16 cities in the delta during 1995-2015. The results show that: (1) 87.1% (690, 200 hm2) of farmland area was lost because of urban sprawl over the last 20 years; (2) the total value of agricultural multifunctionality in the delta had increased by 23.2%, which was mainly attributed to a significant increase in food provision and cultural leisure values; (3) the key factor affecting the spatial differentiation of agricultural multifunctionality changed from agricultural labour in 1995 to gross domestic product in 2005 and 2015; and (4) Socio-economic conditions and natural resources determined the adaptive change model of agricultural multifunctionality in different groups of cities. These results illustrate that agricultural multifunctionality is being adjusted to rapid urbanization through the intensification and trade-off of the multiple functions in agricultural system. Therefore, to foster the sustainable development of agriculture in metropolitan agglomerations, future land use policy should focus on both urban control and promoting agricultural multifunctionality. Ongoing transformation practices, such as land consolidation, should aim to improve the bio-physical and socio-economic functions of farmland in the delta. Future research should focus on developing locally suitable strategies based on the adaptive mechanisms of agricultural multifunctionality under changing environments in different cities.",Is there a specific memory signature associated with Aβ-PET positivity in patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784816,Neurobiology of aging,2019 05 16,"Amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) is a clinical entity with various potential etiologies including but not limited to Alzheimer's disease.

Finer-grained analyses of memory tests showed subtle association with beta amyloid status, revealing a stronger impairment of the primacy effect in beta amyloid-positive patients. Structural magnetic resonance imaging showed that both aMCI subgroups exhibited comparable atrophy patterns, with similar degrees of medial temporal volume loss compared with controls. Specifically assessing the primacy effect might complement global memory scores in identifying beta amyloid-positive patients with aMCI.",Par3 regulates polarized convergence between APP and BACE1 in hippocampal neurons.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784815,Neurobiology of aging,2019 05 22,"The convergence between amyloid precursor protein (APP) and its β-secretase β-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) is a prerequisite for the generation of β-amyloid peptide, a key pathogenic agent for Alzheimer's disease. Yet the underlying molecular mechanisms regulating their convergence remain unclear. Here, we show that the polarity protein partitioning-defective 3 (Par3) regulates the polarized convergence between APP and BACE1 in hippocampal neurons. Par3 forms a complex with BACE1 through its first PDZ domain, which is important for regulating BACE1 endosome-to-TGN trafficking. In the absence of Par3, there is an increase in the convergence between internalized APP and BACE1. In hippocampal neurons, loss of Par3 leads to increased APP and BACE1 convergence in axons but not in dendrites. This polarized convergence mainly occurs in retrograde or stalled axonal late endocytic organelles and is likely due to compartment-specific regulation of APP trafficking by Par3. Together, our data show a novel function for Par3 in regulating polarized convergence between APP and BACE1 in hippocampal neurons.",Prenatal noise stress aggravates cognitive decline and the onset and progression of beta amyloid pathology in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784814,Neurobiology of aging,2019 05 16,"Environmental distresses occurring during the sensitive periods of early life may exacerbate the vulnerability to develop physical and mental diseases in old age. Studies have shown the impact of prenatal stress (PS) on the endocrine development and reprogramming of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis functions in association with cognitive development and susceptibility to neuropsychiatric diseases. Long-term exposure to glucocorticoids can damage the brain and intensify the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD)-like neuropathological changes, especially in females. There is, however, less information as to the link between PS and the risk of developing AD pathology throughout the lifespan. In the present study, male and female APPNL-G-F/NL-G-F offspring of dams exposed to gestational noise stress were compared with the control offspring in corticosterone alternations, cognitive and motor performances, and the onset age and development of amyloid beta (Aβ) plaques across age. The hyperactivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, spatial learning, and Aβ development were sex specific, showing persistent high levels of stress and further memory loss in females than males, especially in PS mice. The Aβ deposition was started earlier, by 2-3 months, and exhibited a heightened progression in PS animals. The PS also created a long-lasting anxiety-like behavior and impairment in cognitive function and motor coordination. Our results suggested PS as a risk to exacerbate AD-like neuropathological changes during the lifespan, with higher susceptibility of females. The findings were discussed in line with the most likely mechanisms for the PS effects, that is, dysregulation of the neuroendocrine system and the placenta by the PS.",Association of amyloid pathology with memory performance and cognitive complaints in cognitively normal older adults: a monozygotic twin study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784813,Neurobiology of aging,2019 05 16,"Amyloid pathology in cognitively normal older adults has been associated with low memory performance and cognitive complaints, but findings are conflicting. Using a monozygotic twin design, we further explored this relation. We investigated 199 cognitively normal older adults (96 twin pairs) and assessed cognitive performance, cognitive complaints, and amyloid pathology on positron emission tomography and in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Participants were on average 70.5 (SD = 7.6) years and 114 (57%) were female. Amyloid-positron emission tomography abnormality on visual read and lower CSF amyloid-β 1-42/1-40 ratio were associated with lower Rey visuospatial memory performance (respectively, β = -0.39 [SE = 0.17], p = 0.02 and β = 0.15 [SE = 0.07], p = 0.04). Twin analyses showed that CSF amyloid-β 1-42/1-40 ratio in one twin of a pair could predict visuospatial memory performance in the cotwin (r = 0.20 [SE = 0.10], p = 0.04). Monozygotic twin discordance analyses further showed a probable effect of disease staging on face-name associative memory performance. Our results suggest amyloid aggregation to be associated with lower visuospatial and face-name-associated memory performance in cognitively normal older adults, supporting the view that amyloid pathology leads to memory dysfunction in very early stages of the disease.",Associations of amygdala volume and shape with transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) pathology in a community cohort of older adults.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784812,Neurobiology of aging,2019 05 16,"Transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) pathology is common in old age and is strongly associated with cognitive decline and dementia above and beyond contributions from other neuropathologies. TDP-43 pathology in aging typically originates in the amygdala, a brain region also affected by other age-related neuropathologies such as Alzheimer's pathology. The purpose of this study was two-fold: to determine the independent effects of TDP-43 pathology on the volume, as well as shape, of the amygdala in a community cohort of older adults, and to determine the contribution of amygdala volume to the variance of the rate of cognitive decline after accounting for the contributions of neuropathologies and demographics. Cerebral hemispheres from 198 participants of the Rush Memory and Aging Project and the Religious Orders Study were imaged with MRI ex vivo and underwent neuropathologic examination. Measures of amygdala volume and shape were extracted for all participants. Regression models controlling for neuropathologies and demographics showed an independent negative association of TDP-43 with the volume of the amygdala. Shape analysis revealed a unique pattern of amygdala deformation associated with TDP-43 pathology. Finally, mixed-effects models showed that amygdala volume explained an additional portion of the variance of the rate of decline in global cognition, episodic memory, semantic memory, and perceptual speed, above and beyond what was explained by demographics and neuropathologies.",Drivers of the fatal drug epidemic.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784811,Journal of health economics,2019 03 30,"This study examines the contributions of the medium-run evolution of local economies and of changes in the ""drug environment' in explaining county-level changes in drug and related mortality rates from 1999 to 2015. A primary finding is that drug mortality rates did increase more in counties experiencing relative economic decline than in those with more robust growth, but that the relationship is weak and mostly accounted for by confounding factors. In the preferred estimates, less than one-tenth of the rise in drug and opioid-involved fatality rates is explained and the contribution is even smaller, quite possibly zero, when allowing for plausible selection on unobservables. Conversely, the risk of drug deaths varies systematically over time across population subgroups in ways that are consistent with an important role for the public health environment related to the availability and cost of drugs. In particular, the relative risk and share of drug mortality increased rapidly for males and younger adults, compared to their counterparts, when the primary driver of the fatal drug epidemic transitioned from prescription to illicit opioids. These results suggest that efforts to improve local economies, while desirable for other reasons, are not likely to yield significant reductions in overdose mortality, but with greater potential for interventions directly addressing the drug environment.","Predictive values of neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet to lymphocyte ratio (PLR), and other prognostic factors in pediatric idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784810,International journal of pediatric otorhinolaryngology,2019 05 14,"No consensus has been reached regarding the optimum treatment or factors affecting prognosis in pediatric idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss (ISSNHL) due to its rarity.

Chemometric techniques were applied to differentiate samples with respect to their geographical origin and interspecies differentiation. Samples of Cantharellus cibarius (Fr.), Boletus edulis (Bull.) and Leccinum scabrum (Bull.) Gray from Morąg, Augustów, the Zaborski Landscape Park, Tarnobrzeg and Umeå were discriminated by factor 1 and factor 2. Some species, i.e. Cantharellus cibarius, Boletus edulis, Boletus pinophilus (Pilát & Dermek), Leccinum aurantiacum (Bull.) Gray, Leccinum scabrum and Leccinum versipelle (Fr. & Hök) Snell from one region of Poland (Augustów or Morąg) were discriminated by K, Na, Mg, Ca, Fe, Zn, Cu, Mn and Cd. The results enabled an assessment of the hypothetical percentage realisation of the recommended dietary intake (RDA) for the bio-elements in question and of provisional tolerable weekly intakes (PTWI) of toxic metals from the consumption of 100 g of mushrooms. The most abundant element in all the mushroom samples was K, especially in Gomphidius glutinosus (Schaeff. ex Fr.) (Umeå - Sweden) and Cantharellus cibarius (Poland - Morąg). Lycoperdon perlatum (Pers.) from Poland and Sweden tended to accumulate the highest levels of Mg, Fe, Zn and Cu. The highest percentage of RDA was obtained for K, Mg and Cu. Based on the estimated PTWI, it can be concluded that no health hazard is associated with the consumption of these mushrooms.",Selenium enhanced phytoremediation of diesel contaminated soil by Alternanthera philoxeroides.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784798,Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,2019 04 11,"Using a 60-day pot culture experiment, we investigated the effect of selenium on phytoremediation of soil containing high-level diesel by Alternanthera philoxeroides (alligator weed). Diesel (20 g kg-1) decreased the growth of A. philoxeroides and induced oxidative stress, as indicated by tissue levels of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and malondialdehyde (MDA). Adding Se (0.5 or 1.5 mg kg-1) to diesel-treated soil alleviated oxidative stress and improved biomass production, and the low dose was as effective as the high dose. After 60 days, the reduction in rhizospheric soil diesel was 20.1 ± 0.55% without Se and 35.2 ± 3.6% with Se, showing a significant increase in efficiency. Again, the low Se dose was as effective as the high dose. These findings advance the field phytoremediation by demonstrating that Se, at 0.5 mg kg-1, enhances removal and increases plant tolerance to petroleum hydrocarbons.","Use of biological detection methods to assess dioxin-like compounds in sediments of Bohai Bay, China.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784797,Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,2019 04 11,"Bohai Bay, in the western region of northeastern China's Bohai Sea, receives water from large rivers containing various pollutants including dioxin-like compounds (DLCs). This study used the established zebrafish (Danio rerio) model, its known developmental toxicity endpoints and sensitive molecular analyses to evaluate sediments near and around an industrial effluent site in Bohai Bay. The primary objective was to assess the efficacy of rapid biological detection methods as an addition to chemical analyses. Embryos were exposed to various concentrations of sediment extracts as well as a 2, 3, 7, 8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) positive control. Exposure to sediment extract nearest the discharge site (P1) resulted in the most severe- and highest rates of change in embryos and larvae, suggesting that DLC contaminated sediment probably did not occur much beyond it. P1 extract resulted in concentration dependent increases in mortality and pericardial edema. Its highest concentration caused up-regulation of P-450 (CYP)-1A1(CYP1A) mRNA expression at 72 h post fertilization (hpf), an increase in its expression in gill arches as observed by whole mount in situ hybridization, and an increased signal in the Tg(cyp1a: mCherry) transgenic line. The pattern and magnitude of response was very similar to that of TCDD and supported the presence of DLCs in these sediment samples. Follow-up chemical analysis confirmed this presence and identified H7CDF, O8CDF and O8CDD as the main components in P1 extract. This study validates the use of biological assays as a rapid, sensitive, and cost-effective method to evaluate DLCs and their effects in sediment samples. Additionally, it provides support for the conclusion that DLCs have limited remobilization capacity in marine sediments.",Size effect of polystyrene microplastics on sorption of phenanthrene and nitrobenzene.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784796,Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,2019 04 11,"Microplastics can have strong sorption capacity for many contaminants, thus greatly influencing the fate, transport and bioavailability of those contaminants in the environment. However, the effect of particle size on contaminant sorption by microplastics is still poorly understood. This study investigated the sorption of phenanthrene and nitrobenzene to micron-, submicron- and nano- sized polystyrene microplastics of 170 µm, 102 µm, 50 µm, 30 µm, 800 nm, 235 nm or 50 nm. All phenanthrene sorption isotherms and most nitrobenzene sorption isotherms were linear because of the strong sorption capacity of microplastics and the hydrophobic partitioning. The log Kd values ranged between 3.07-4.20 and 1.58-3.14 log (L/kg) for phenanthrene and nitrobenzene, respectively. The log Kd values of phenanthrene and nitrobenzene both increased with decreasing particle size for micron-sized polystyrenes (micro-polystyrene) and submicron-sized polystyrenes (submicro-polystyrene). However, in comparison with 235 nm submicro-polystyrene, the log Kd values of 50 nm nano-polystyrene were significantly lower for phenanthrene and comparable for nitrobenzene because its aggregation greatly reduced the effective surface area accessible for sorption. The results improved our understanding of the fate and risks of microplastics associated with the two typical organic contaminants in the micrometer to nanometer scale.",Selenium alleviated chromium stress in Chinese cabbage (Brassica campestris L. ssp. Pekinensis) by regulating root morphology and metal element uptake.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784794,Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,2019 04 11,"Excessive chromium (Cr) causes toxicity to plants, while the beneficial effects of selenium (Se) have been verified in plants under various adverse conditions. Under Cr stress, the impacts of exogenous Se on root morphology and metal element uptake were investigated in root of Chinese cabbage by cellular and biochemical approaches. Exogenous Se alleviated Cr-induced irreversible damage to root morphology, plasma membrane integrity and ultrastructure of root tip cells. Compared with Cr treatment alone, exogenous Se reduced root Cr content by 17%. Se supply changed the subcellular distribution of Cr in root, and the concentration of Cr was reduced in the fractions of plastids and mitochondria, while increased in soluble fraction. Besides, exogenous Se counteracted the nutrient elements (Na, Ca, Fe, Mn, Cu and Zn) loss induced by Cr. For plant with Se pretreatment, the increase rate of Cr influx was lower than that of plant without Se pretreatment, particularly in solution containing high concentration (100-400 μmol L-1) of Cr. In addition, higher Km value was observed in plant with Se pretreatment, which indicated a lower Cr affinity than that of plant without Se pretreatment. The results suggest that Se modified root morphology and regulated nutrient elements uptake by root, which might play a combined role in reducing Cr uptake by root, consequently alleviating Cr stress and maintaining plant growth.","Transfer and biological effects of arsenate from soil through a plant-aphid system to the parasitoid wasp, Aphidius colemani.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784793,Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,2019 04 11,"The accumulation of metalloid elements during transfer from contaminated soil to higher trophic levels may potentially result in the exposure of parasitic arthropods to toxic concentrations of these elements. This study examined the transfer of arsenate (As(V)) to aphids (Myzus persicae) from pepper plants cultivated in As(V) contaminated soils of two concentrations (2 and 6 mg As(V)/kg dry soil), and the subsequent biological effects on the aphid parasitoid, Aphidius colemani. Results showed that considerable quantities of As(V) were transferred to the plant in a concentration-dependent manner and were partitioned in the plant parts in the order of roots > stems > leaves. The accumulation of As(V) in the aphids increased with the concentrations in the plants; however, the transfer coefficient of As(V) from leaf to aphid was relatively similar and constant (0.07-0.08) at both soil As(V) concentration levels. Increased levels of As(V) significantly affected fecundity and honeydew production in aphids, but survival and developmental time were unaffected. Fecundity (mummification rate) of the parasitoid was not impaired by host As(V) contamination; however, vitality (eclosion rate) was significantly affected. Results are discussed in relation to possible ecological risks posed by the transfer of soil As(V) via the plant-arthropod system to parasitoid arthropods in agroecosystems.",Insight into bovine (Bos indicus) spermatozoal whole transcriptome profile.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784792,Theriogenology,2019 05 21,"Mature spermatozoa harbor both coding and non-coding type of RNAs which regulates spermatogenesis, fertilization and early development. Characterization of bovine sperm transcriptome can provide more insight into the molecular mechanisms involved in these processes.

RNA-Seq analysis identified 14,306 genes expressed with FPKM >0, while 405 genes expressed when threshold increased to FPKM >5. Functional annotations showed that sperm transcripts were associated with molecular processes (translation, ribosomal small and large subunit assembly) and cellular components (cytosolic small and large ribosomal subunit and membranes) related to known sperm functions at fertilization and spermatogenesis. The RNA-Seq data was validated using droplet digital PCR where both highly abundant gene viz. RN7SL1 and less abundant gene viz. ZFP280B were validated.

Pregnancy and lactation occur contemporaneously in dairy cows, and have major impacts on thyroid hormones as well as status of the hypothalamus-pituitary thyroid axis influences pregnancy and lactation. As especially the thyroid hormone axis with special focus to TSH is not well studies in the past, the aim of the study was to examine the thyroid hormone axis, especially in heifers during adaptation to the first lactation, to verify the association between lactation and thyroid hormones. Secondly, the early pregnancy period was the focus of the present investigation. To determine thyroid hormone patterns and especially thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) during the transition period, 12 primiparous Holstein Friesian cows and 41 pregnant and 34 non-pregnant pluriparous cows were sampled. During the transition period, thyroxin (T4) concentrations decreased after calving in primiparous cows, and the milk yield [kg] was negatively correlated with triiodothyronine (T3) and T4 concentrations. In pregnant and non-pregnant pluriparous cows, T3, T4, TSH and free T4 (fT4) decreased between the day of ovulation (day 0) and day 18. From day 18 of gestation to day 100 after AI, an increase in TSH and fT4 and a decrease in Reverse T3 (rT3) was observed in the pregnant cows. In conclusion, the results of the present study confirm that regulative processes within the thyroid hormone metabolism occur during early lactation. For the first time it could be shown in dairy cows that TSH and fT4 increased during early pregnancy whereas rT3 decreased indicating also in bovine species a TSH stimulatory effect by pregnancy.",Cellular localization and seasonal variation in BMP15 expression in ovary of the catfish Clarias batrachus and its role in ovarian steroidogenesis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784790,Theriogenology,2019 05 21,"Despite important actions of BMP15 (a TGFβ superfamily member) in follicular development in vertebrates, studies are mostly limited to mammals. The folliculogenic processes in lower vertebrates, particularly, fishes are quite different from mammals. It was, therefore, decided to detect the presence of BMP15 in ovarian follicles and what are its role in folliculogenesis and steroidogenesis in catfish? BMP15 protein was detected in different cellular compartments of ovarian follicles of the catfish collected during different reproductive phases, using immunohistochemical and Western blotting methods, with concurrent measurement of ovarian steroids through ELISA. In vitro effects of rhBMP15 on ovarian steroids, expression and activities of steroidogenic enzymes and StAR were also analyzed using established immunoblotting and spectrophotometric methods. BMP15 was localized distinctly in the nest of oogonia, perinucleolar oocytes and in oocytes as well as follicular cells of the primary ovarian follicles, which started diminishing gradually with the progression of folliculogenesis in oocytes-II and finally it was greatly reduced in the oocytes-III (fully grown follicles). BMP15 expression in follicles showed negative correlation with ovarian steroid levels. Further BMP15 also inhibited steroids production by suppressing the expression and activities of ovarian 3β-HSD, 17β-HSD and aromatase, however, it did not influence the expression of StAR. The findings of study suggests that BMP15 help in maintaining the early-stage oocytes in catfish and inhibits follicular growth by reducing ovarian steroidogenesis through suppression of the expression and activities of steroidogenic enzymes.","Effects of maternal dietary nitrate supplementation on farrowing and placental characteristics, level of asphyxiation at birth and piglet vitality.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784789,Theriogenology,2019 05 21,"We investigated whether maternal dietary nitrate supplementation, leading to nitric oxide (NO) formation, would affect duration of farrowing, levels of asphyxiation, vitality of piglets at birth and/or loss of potential viable piglets in the form of stillbirth and pre-weaning mortality. Data were collected from 190 crossbred (Yorkshire x Dutch Landrace) sows, which were allocated, balanced for parity, to six dietary nitrate levels (0, 0.03, 0.06, 0.09, 0.12 or 0.15% of nitrate). Sow received the lactational diet containing nitrate from approximately 7 days before farrowing until 5 days after farrowing. Blood acid-base parameters (pH, pO2, pCO2, BEecf, HCO3, sO2 and lactate) and nitrate concentration were determined in umbilical cord blood. The farrowing process was video recorded and later analysed for total duration of farrowing, piglet birth interval, piglet vitality was scored and piglet latency to stand right after birth. Placentas were collected after expulsion during and after farrowing. Placenta length and width were measured and placental color scores were assessed based on redness of the placenta. The probability of a higher vitality score of piglets (being more vital) linearly increased with increasing levels of maternal dietary nitrate. This higher vitality score however, was not reflected by changes in the blood acid-base parameters in umbilical cord blood, except for a tendency for a higher pO2 with increasing levels of nitrate, which could have been caused by a quicker onset of respiration or an increased blood flow to the piglets during birth. Placenta width increased with increasing levels of maternal dietary nitrate, but no effect on placenta length and redness was found. Neither duration of farrowing nor birth interval were affected by maternal dietary nitrate level. In conclusion, maternal nitrate supplementation may affect piglet vitality via vasodilatation (placental characteristics) rather than an increase in exercise efficiency (duration of farrowing)."

However, the mechanism(s) that could explain possible development of TEEs due to C1INH remains unknown. In this work, we evaluated plausible impact of C1INH on the protein C (PC) anticoagulant system. We performed thrombin generation (TG) assays (TGA) and analyzed spatial fibrin clot propagation using thrombodynamics in plasma of individual donors after the addition of thrombomodulin (TM) and C1INH. The addition of C1INH was consistent with the plasma concentrations resulting from doses currently approved for the HAE treatment up to ones consistent with off-label use in patients with risk of inflammation. 16 IU/ml of C1INH significantly enhanced thrombin peak (TP) generation in the presence of 12 and 15 nM TM. TG enhancement was observed by the addition of C1INH to make concentrations equal to 2 and 4 IU/ml in some donor plasmas. C1INH addition in the presence of TM enhanced the stop time of spatial clot growth in Thrombodynamics assay. A chromogenic activity assay demonstrated that C1INH inhibited PC activation by thrombin in the presence of TM. Substitution of TM with APC in TGA attenuated the TP enhancing effect of C1INH. The collective results of the present study suggest a concentration dependent C1INH interaction with the PC system. This study introduces a plausible TM-dependent mechanism, that may explain reported TEEs via suppressed production of APC in the presence of C1INH.",Cerebrospinal fluid cytokine/chemokine/growth factor profiles in idiopathic hypertrophic pachymeningitis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784775,Journal of neuroimmunology,2019 04 01,"Hypertrophic pachymeningitis (HP) is a rare neurologic disease causing inflammatory fibrous thickening of the brain and spinal dura mater.

This experience indicated the importance of suspecting treatable DLB even when the findings of laboratory and radiological tests fulfill the diagnostic criteria of DLB.,Angiopoietin-like proteins in multiple sclerosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784773,Journal of neuroimmunology,2019 04 01,"Angiopoietin-like proteins (ANGPTLs) are a group of proteins with functions in lipid metabolism, angiogenesis, and inflammation. Here, we investigated their involvement in multiple sclerosis (MS) progression and response to treatment in 100 MS patients and 77 healthy controls. ANGPTLs significantly associated with MS progression and response to therapy. High ANGPTL6 levels associated with slow disease progression and good response to fingolimod treatment and low ANGPTL4 associated with poor response to natalizumab treatment. Therefore, we propose high ANGPTL4 and 6 levels as markers for positive response to MS treatments either natalizumab or fingolimod respectively. Further investigations into their role in MS is warranted.",Noninvasive temperature monitoring for dual-modal tumor therapy based on lanthanide-doped up-conversion nanocomposites.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784771,Biomaterials,2019 03 11,"Accurate treatment of photothermal therapy (PTT) is crucial to avoid the unnecessary injury of normal cells and tissues. Therefore the real-time temperature monitoring in the PTT process has drawn more and more attention in recent years. Herein, we designed and prepared one kind of lanthanide (Ln3+)-doped up-conversion nanocomposites with multi-functions, which can not only provide temperature feedback in PTT process, but also play the photodynamic therapy (PDT) function for the synergistic effect of tumor therapy. Based on NaYF4:Yb, Er up-conversion nanoparticles (UCNPs), mesoporous SiO2 was modified on the surface combined with photosensitizer Chlorin e6 (Ce6) molecules, which could be excited by red emission of Er3+ under the 980 nm laser. Cit-CuS NPs were further linked on the surface of the composite served as photothermal conversion agent, therefore, the temperature of the PTT site can be monitored by recording the ratio of I525/I545 of green emissions, especially within the physiological range. Based on the guidance obtained from spectral experiments, we further investigated the dual-modal therapy effect both in vitro and in vivo, respectively, and acquired decent results.",Assembly of upconversion nanophotosensitizer in vivo to achieve scatheless real-time imaging and selective photodynamic therapy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784770,Biomaterials,2019 03 11,"A perfect ""off"" to ""on"" switch of the therapeutic function is very important to minimize the phototoxicity of nanoplatforms assisted imaging-guided photodynamic therapy (PDT) of cancer. Current approaches rely on preloaded photosensitizers, where the off/on state of PDT is regulated by the sensitizing light of photosensitizers. However, the photoactivities inevitably occur when imaging/diagnosis or exposure to sunlight, etc. These preloading approaches will cause the damage to normal cells and the photosensitivity to the skin. Taking upconversion photodynamic therapy as an example we report here a biorthogonal chemistry solution to circumvent this problem. The luminescence upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) are anchored with one handle of click reaction and targeting entity, these nanoplatforms enable the imaging/labelling/tracking, especially for imaging-guided surgery. Once they are targeted, the photosensitizers armed with the other match handle will be injected in situ and click reaction will occur between the two handles to link the photosensitizers closely with the targeted nanoplatforms in a very short time, enabling the PDT function of the nanoplatforms. Proof of principle has been demonstrated in vitro and in vivo. This approach can be readily extended to chemotherapy, radiotherapy, etc. to overcome the side effect of these therapies of cancers.",Cleavable cellulosic sponge for functional hepatic cell culture and retrieval.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784769,Biomaterials,2019 03 11,"Interconnected macroporous hydrogel is hydrophilic; it exhibits soft tissue-like mechanical property and aqueous-stable macroporosity for 3D spheroid culture. There is an unmet need to develop cleavable macroporous hydrogel, for the ease of retrieving functional spheroids for further in vitro and in vivo applications. We have developed and comprehensively characterized a hydroxypropyl-cellulose-disulfide sponge by systematically identifying strategies and synthesis schemes to confer cleavability to the sponge under cell-friendly conditions. It preserved the essential advantages of the macroporous hydrogel to support 3D spheroid formation and maintenance of sensitive hepatocytes while allowing rapid cleavage and retrieval of functional spheroids. By culturing HepaRG as spheroids in the cleavable sponge, we have accelerated HepaRG differentiation to 9 days compared to 28 days in 2D culture. Cytochrome P450 basal activity reached significantly higher level, while albumin secretion and fluorescein diacetate staining indicated the same at day 5. The purity of albumin+ hepatocytes reached 92.9% versus 7.1% of CK19+ cholangiocytes at day 9, a much stronger preference for hepatocytes than the 60% albumin+ hepatocytes purity in 2D culture. HepaRG differentiated hepatocytes were retrieved by cleaving the sponge with 10 mM tris-(2-carboxyethyl)-phosphine (TCEP) within 30 min preserving viability, plateability and positive albumin staining of the hepatocyte spheroids. This cleavable macroporous hydrogel sponge will support the rapid development of various 3D spheroid- or organoid-based applications in basic research and drug testing.",Surface tethering of stem cells with H2O2-responsive anti-oxidizing colloidal particles for protection against oxidation-induced death.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784768,Biomaterials,2019 03 29,"Mesenchymal stem cells are the new generation of medicine for treating numerous vascular diseases and tissue defects because of their ability to secrete therapeutic factors. Poor cellular survival in an oxidative diseased tissue, however, hinders the therapeutic efficacy. To this end, we hypothesized that tethering the surface of stem cells with colloidal particles capable of discharging antioxidant cargos in response to elevated levels of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) would maintain survival and therapeutic activity of the stem cells. We examined this hypothesis by encapsulating epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) and manganese oxide (MnO2) nanocatalysts into particles comprising poly(d,l-lactide-co-glycolide)-block-hyaluronic acid. The MnO2 nanocatalysts catalyzed the decomposition of H2O2 into oxygen gas, which increased the internal pressure of particles and accelerated the release of EGCG by 1.5-fold. Consequently, stem cells exhibited 1.2-fold higher metabolic activity and 2.8-fold higher secretion level of pro-angiogenic factor in sub-lethal H2O2 concentrations. These stem cells, in turn, performed a greater angiogenic potential with doubled number of newly formed mature blood vessels. We envisage that the results of this study will contribute to improving the therapeutic efficacy of a wide array of stem cells.",Modulation of antiviral immunity by the ichnovirus HdIV in Spodoptera frugiperda.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784767,Molecular immunology,2019 05 06,"Polydnaviruses (PDVs) are obligatory symbionts found in thousands of endoparasitoid species and essential for successful parasitism. The two genera of PDVs, ichnovirus (IV) and bracovirus (BV), use different sets of virulence factors to ensure successful parasitization of the host. Previous studies have shown that PDVs target apoptosis, one of the innate antiviral responses in many host organisms. However, IV and BV have been shown to have opposite effects on this process. BV induces apoptosis in host cells, whereas some IV proteins have been shown to have anti-apoptotic activity. The different biological contexts in which the assays were performed may account for this difference. In this study, we evaluated the interplay between apoptosis and the ichnovirus HdIV from the parasitoid Hyposoter didymator, in the HdIV-infected hemocytes and fat bodies of S. frugiperda larvae, and in the Sf9 insect cell line challenged with HdIV. We found that HdIV induced cell death in hemocytes and fat bodies, whereas anti-apoptotic activity was observed in HdIV-infected Sf9 cells, with and without stimulation with viral PAMPs or chemical inducers. We also used an RT-qPCR approach to determine the expression profiles of a set of genes known to encode key components of the other main antiviral immune pathways described in insects. The analysis of immune gene transcription highlighted differences in antiviral responses to HdIV as a function of host cell type. However, all these antiviral pathways appeared to be neutralized by low levels of expression for the genes encoding the key components of these pathways, in all biological contexts. Finally, we investigated the effect of HdIV on the general antiviral defenses of the lepidopteran larvae in more detail, by studying the survival of S. frugiperda co-infected with HdIV and the entomopathogenic densovirus JcDV. Coinfected S. frugiperda larvae have increased resistance to JcDV at an early phase of infection, whereas HdIV effects enhance the virulence of the virus at later stages of infection. Overall, these results reveal complex interactions between HdIV and its cellular environment."

Further, we comprehensively analysed data, interpret differences and identify existing gaps with those from other continents. We observed that high levels of PCDD/Fs and dl-PCBs were reported in environmental and biological samples near densely populated urban and industrialised areas compared to those in rural settings. In general, the concentrations of PCDD/Fs and dl-PCBs in the blood samples from Africa were in the same range as those from Asia but lower than those from Europe. The concentrations of dioxins and dioxin-like compounds in the atmosphere in Africa were comparable to and/or higher than those in developed countries. The reported sources of PCDD/Fs and dl-PCBs in Africa were industrial emissions, obsolete pesticide stockpiles, household heating, recycling of electronic waste, and incineration and combustion of domestic waste. Regional and intercontinental transport of dioxins could not be confirmed because of the lack of sufficient literature on them. Further data about the levels and sources of PCDD/Fs and dl-PCBs in Africa need to be generated to complete the chemical inventories for the continent and to facilitate the implementation of the Stockholm Convention on persistent organic pollutants. The reviewed literature shows that most analyses have been carried out in laboratories outside Africa because of the limited institutional capacity in Africa. More support needs to be given to laboratories in Africa to develop the capacity to accurately quantify dioxins on routine basis.",Impacts of exhaled aerosol from the usage of the tobacco heating system to indoor air quality: A chamber study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784754,Chemosphere,2019 06 13,"Aerosol particle, carbonyl, and nicotine concentrations were analysed as pollutants affecting indoor air quality during the usage of electrically-heated tobacco product - the Tobacco Heating System (THS). Quantitative experimental variables included THS use intensity as number of parallel users (1, 3, or 5), distance to the bystander (0.5, 1, or 2 m), as well as environmental conditions in a chamber: ventilation intensity as air changes per hour (0.2, 0.5, or 1 h-1), and relative humidity (RH, 30, 50 or 70%). The real-time particle number (PNC), CO and CO2 concentration, as well as off-line acetaldehyde, formaldehyde, nicotine, and 3-ethenylpyridine concentration was measured during and after the active usage. Use of THS resulted in a statistically significant increase of several analytes including nicotine, acetaldehyde, PM2.5, and PNC as compared to the background. The obtained levels were significantly lower (approximately 16, 8, 8 and 28 times for nicotine, acetaldehyde, PNC and PM2.5, respectively) compared to the levels resulting from conventional cigarette (CC) smoking under identical conditions. The maximum 30 min concentration of PNC (4.8 × 105 #/cm3), as well as maximum concentration of PNC (9.3 × 106 #/cm3) suggest that the intensive use of THS in a confined space with limited ventilation might cause substantially elevated aerosol concentrations, although these particles appeared as highly volatile ones and evaporated within seconds. Generally, the usage intensity (number of simultaneous users) prevailed as the most important factor positively affecting pollutant variations; another important factor was the distance to bystander.",Multifunctional magnetic sphere-MoS2@Au hybrid for surface-enhanced Raman scattering detection and visible light photo-Fenton degradation of aromatic dyes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784753,Chemosphere,2019 06 13,"A ternary hybrid, MNPs-MoS2@Au, composed of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) grown on a magnetic sphere (MNPs)-MoS2 microflower composite (MNPs-MoS2) was proposed for surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) detection and visible-light photo-Fenton degradation of aromatic dyes. The hybrid was prepared by sequential solvothermal growth of MNPs and MoS2, and electroless deposition of AuNPs. A comparison of results revealed that the synergy among these components endowed the hybrid with a much higher SERS enhancement ability than MNPs, or MNPs@MoS2. The dosage of HAuCl4 and MNPs-MoS2 to prepare the hybrid greatly influenced the SERS activity of the hybrid. Under optimized conditions, quantitative SERS analysis of dyes including CV, MG, and MB was performed with a low detection limit (1 pM, 0.15 nM and 1 nM for CV, MG, and MB, respectively) and adequate reproducibility (RSDs were less than 6% and 11% for CV and MG, respectively). The hybrid could also serve as a visible light-active photo-Fenton catalyst for efficient degradation of aromatic dyes, and the decolorization of 20 mg/L RhB was 90% in 40 min in the presence of H2O2 because of a synergy mechanism among components confirmed by comparison experiment and first-order kinetics study.

Under microaerobic-light conditions, R. palustris TN110 synthesized CdS nanoparticles. The produced CdS nanoparticles had a spherical shape and an average size of 4.85 nm. The Fourier transform infrared spectrum of the nanoparticles reveals the carbonyl groups, bending vibrations of the amide I and II bands of proteins, and CN stretching vibrations of aromatic and aliphatic amines. These bands and groups suggest protein capping/binding on the surface of the nanoparticles. R. palustris TN110 converted 25.61% of 0.2 mM CdCl2 to CdS nanoparticles under optimal conditions (pH 7.5, 30 °C and 3000 lux). The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) value of the produced CdS nanoparticles was 1.76 mM. The produced CdS nanoparticles at IC50 up-regulated two genes associated with nitrogen fixation: Mo-Fe nitrogenase gene (nifH) and V-Fe nitrogenase gene (vnfG) at 2.83 and 2.27 fold changes, respectively. On the contrary, the produced CdS nanoparticles slightly down-regulated Fe-Fe nitrogenase gene (anfG). The amounts of ammonia released by the strain support the gene expression results. R. palustris TN110 has great potential to serve concurrently as a cadmium bioremediation agent and a nitrogen fixer. The strain could be beneficial to paddy fields that are contaminated with Cd through run off from mining and chemical fertilizer applications.",The detection of drugs of abuse and pharmaceuticals in drinking water using solid-phase extraction and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784750,Chemosphere,2019 05 08,"Pharmaceuticals and drugs of abuse including novel psychoactive substances (NPS) are emerging as newer contaminants in the aquatic environment. The presence of such pollutants has implications on the environment as well as public health and therefore their identification is important when monitoring water quality. This research presents a new method for the simultaneous detection of 20 drugs of abuse and pharmaceuticals in drinking water, including 15 NPS, three traditional illicit drugs and two antidepressants. The developed method is based on the use of solid-phase extraction (SPE) followed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). The SPE recoveries for the majority of target analytes ranged between 62 and 107%. The method detection and quantification limits ranged between 0.01 and 1.09 ng/L and 0.02-3.64 ng/L respectively. Both instrumental and method precisions resulted in relative standard deviations <15.04%, with an accuracy of < ±8.66%. The results show that LC-MS can be an alternative to the more popular technique of liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry for the analysis of drugs of abuse and pharmaceuticals in drinking water. This newly developed simultaneous detection method has been applied to drinking water collected from the East Anglia region of the UK. Citalopram, cocaine, fluoxetine, ketamine, mephedrone, methamphetamine and methylone were detected at the range of 0.14 and 2.81 ng/L. This is the first time that the two NPS mephedrone and methylone, have been detected in UK drinking water.",Assessment of biomass ash applications in soil and cement mortars.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784749,Chemosphere,2019 05 08,"The pH-dependent availability and leaching of major and trace elements was investigated for a wide range of biomass ash from different fuels and conversion technologies. A technical and environmental assessment of selected biomass ash for application in soil or cement mortars was performed, using both the total content and leaching of elements. A large variation in biomass ash composition, yet consistent pH dependent leaching patterns were observed for most elements and conversion technologies. Chromium showed a distinct behaviour which was hypothesized to reflect redox conditions during conversion of the biomass. The leaching based approach was found to provide a more realistic assessment of the availability of desired (i.e. nutrients) and undesired elements (i.e. contaminants) in soil systems. When applied to a reference soil at a rate of 2% by weight, the selected biomass ash increased the concentration of particularly Cr, Mo and Zn in soil solution to a level of concern. For cement applications, the release of Ba, Cr and Mo can become of concern during the second life stage, but the release was not attributed to the included biomass ash. Both soil and cement matrixes were found to control the release of elements such as Cu, V and Ni (soil) and As, Cr and Mo (cement) when compared to the released from pure biomass ash, underlining the importance of evaluating the availability and leaching of desired and undesired elements in the application scenario. Given current regulatory criteria, beneficial utilization of biomass ash in cement may be more feasible than in soil, but regulatory criteria based on leaching rather than total content of elements may widen the application potential of biomass ash.",Degradation of aniline in aqueous solution by dielectric barrier discharge plasma: Mechanism and degradation pathways.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784748,Chemosphere,2019 05 08,"The degradation of aniline solution using the dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma was studied in this paper. The results indicated that the initial concentration of aniline, applied voltage and initial pH value affected the removal efficiency of aniline significantly. After 12 min with DBD plasma treatment, 90.2% removal efficiency was achieved at aniline concentration of 100 mg L-1 with an applied voltage of 3.0 kV and pH 8.43. The removal efficiency decreased with the presence of radical scavengers, indicating that hydroxyl radical plays a key role in the degradation process. The removal efficiency increased obviously when Fe2+ was added. Additionally, the intermediate products generated in the degradation process of aniline were analyzed by some analytical techniques, including total organic carbon analysis, ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy, Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometer, etc. The results showed that the degradation of aniline was mainly due to the strong oxidizing capacity of hydroxyl radical produced by the DBD plasma system. Based on the intermediate products identified in the study, the possible degradation mechanism and pathways were proposed.",Biochar alleviates fluoride toxicity and oxidative stress in safflower (Carthamus tinctorius L.) seedlings.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784747,Chemosphere,2019 05 08,"An original research was laid out as factorial to evaluate the possible effects of biochar (0, 25 and 50 g kg-1 soil) on mitigating fluoride toxicity (non-contamination, 100, 200, 400 and 800 mg NaF kg-1 soil) in safflower seedlings. Increasing fluoride toxicity up to 200 mg NaF kg-1 soil did not decrease the safflower growth. However, the growth of plants under 400 and 800 mg NaF kg-1 was reduced by enhancing soluble fluoride concentration in the soil. This growth reduction was the consequence of an increase in fluoride content of plant tissues, generation of super oxide radicals and hydrogen peroxide, lipid peroxidation, misbalancing potassium and calcium ions, and a decrease in synthesis of photosynthetic pigments including chlorophylls, carotenoids, anthocyanin, flavonoids and xanthophyll's and photochemical efficiency of photosystem II. Application of biochar decreased the fluoride solubility, fluoride content of plant tissues, oxidative stress and antioxidant enzymes activities, leading to an increase in cation exchange capacity of soil and the pH, calcium and potassium uptakes, maximum efficiency of photosystem II, synthesis of photosynthetic pigments, and plant growth. In general, addition of 50 g biochar to 1 kg soil was the best treatment for alleviation of the fluoride toxicity in safflower plants.",Identifying sulfur species adsorbed on particulate matters in exhaust gas emitted from various vessels.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784746,Chemosphere,2019 05 08,"Ship fuels are highly associated with the emission of particulate matter and sulfur. Sulfur adsorbed on particulate matter in exhaust gases from fuels is generally considered to be sulfate. However, other chemical species of sulfur adsorbed on particulate matter in ship exhaust gases are not well known. The purpose of this study is to identify sulfur species adsorbed on particulate matter in ship exhaust gases using X-ray absorption fine structure. Particulate matter and soot samples were collected from a container carrier, a tugboat, an electric propulsion vessel, training vessels, and a marine engine, and sulfur species of particulate matter and soot were identified by X-ray absorption fine structure analysis. Sulfur emission adsorbed on particulate matter and sulfur species did not change between high and middle loads. In this study, sulfonate derived from fuel or oxidation of sulfide in fuel was identified in addition to sulfate. Total sulfur and sulfate concentrations in soot increased with increasing fuel sulfur content. The concentration of organosulfurorganosulfurs in soot such as thiophen and sulfonate, which originated mainly from fuel and engine oil, tended to increase with increasing fuel sulfur content.",Direct filtration for the treatment of the coagulated domestic sewage using flat-sheet ceramic membranes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784745,Chemosphere,2019 05 08,"Direct membrane filtration (DMF) is considered as a promising technology for municipal wastewater treatment. We utilized an innovative application of flat-sheet ceramic membranes (FSCM) for DMF for the rapid treatment of domestic sewage. Coagulation was applied before FSCM filtration to increase the pollutant removal and to mitigate membrane fouling. This coagulation-FSCM filtration can significantly reduce the pollutant load on the downstream treatment and concentrate organics and nutrients into sludge to facilitate resource recovery. Using polyaluminum chloride (PACl) based FSCM filtration, approximately 90.0% of the chemical oxygen demand (COD) and 99.0% of the phosphorus (P) were removed from the sewage influent and retained in the concentrated sludge, with less than 25.0 mg/L COD left in the effluent. Long-term operation of the PACl-based FSCM filtration stably maintained a high flux of 41.7 L/m2-h (LMH, or 1.0 m/d). The fouled membranes were cleaned chemically every 3-5 d, and the membrane permeability could almost be completely recovered using chemical backwash for only 10 min with a diluted acidic, alkaline, chlorine or H2O2 solution. The novel FSCM process will fundamentally advance wastewater treatment technology. It can be readily modularized and installed as simple add-on units to upgrade and retrofit existing wastewater treatment systems."

However, it is challenging to clearly differentiate between the contributions of individual pollutants on toxicity from complex mixtures of ambient air pollutants. The aim of this study is to generate aerosols constituted by silica nanoparticles (NPs) and bisulfate to serve as simulators of particle-associated high-sulfur air pollution. Then, the health impacts of sulfur dioxide were evaluated at the cellular level using an air-liquid interface (ALI) exposure chamber. BEAS-2B cells were exposed to either nano-silica or bisulfite aerosol individually or bisulfate-coated silica (SiO2-NH2@HSO3) for 3 h using the ALI. The cellular toxicities were carefully compared based on the exposure dosages. The ALI exposure of SiO2 NPs alone did not produce any apparent cytotoxicity in cells, but the aerosol exposure of SiO2-NH2@HSO3 significantly decreased the cell viability and enhanced the production of cellular reactive oxygen species in a dose-dependent manner. Consequently, the excessive oxidative stress resulted in mitochondrial damage as well as cellular apoptosis. ALI exposure can possibly reflect the realistic physiological exposure condition of the human respiratory system. As a derivative of the sulfur dioxide component of air pollution, sulfate exacerbates the toxic effects of inhalable PMs. This result may be due to the large surface area of the nanoparticles, with the possibility of carrying more sulfite to the target cells during aerosol exposure. The sulfate levels offer a meaningful complement to the present PM2.5 index of air pollution for achieving better human health protection.",Life-time exposure to waterborne copper II: Patterns of tissue accumulation and gene expression of the metal-transport proteins ctr1 and atp7b in the killifish Poecilia vivipara.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784733,Chemosphere,2019 05 09,"The involvement of transporting proteins on copper (Cu) bioaccumulation was evaluated in the killifish Poecilia vivipara chronically exposed to environmentally relevant concentrations of waterborne Cu. Fish (<24 h-old) were maintained under control condition or exposed to different waterborne Cu concentrations (5, 9 and 20 μg/L) for 28 and 345 days in saltwater. Following exposure periods, Cu accumulation and the expression of genes encoding for the high affinity Cu-transporter (ctr1) and the P-type Cu-ATPase (atp7b) were evaluated. Whole-body metal accumulation and gene expression were evaluated in fish exposed to 28 days. Similarly, in fish exposed to 345 days, liver, gills and gut were also evaluated. No fish survival was observed after exposure to 20 μg/L for 345 days. Whole-body Cu accumulation was significantly higher in fish exposed to 20 μg/L Cu for 28 days and in fish exposed to 9 μg/L for 345 days in comparison to control animals. Similarly, tissue Cu accumulation was significantly higher in fish exposed to 9 μg/L for 345 days in comparison to control animal. However, no significant accumulation was observed in fish muscle. Following exposure for 28 days, whole-body ctr1 expression was slightly induced in fish exposed to 9 μg/L. In turn, no significant change in ctr1 expression was observed following exposure to Cu for 345 days. Differently, whole-body atp7b expression was markedly up-regulated in the whole-body of fish exposed Cu for 28 days and in tissues of fish exposed to Cu for 345 days. These findings indicate the expression of atp7b is more responsive to Cu accumulation in P. vivipara than ctr1 expression and, therefore, more suitable to be used as a biomarker of exposure to this metal. Also, we argue that the expression of atp7b is sustained at elevated levels for as much time as fish are maintained in Cu contaminated water.",Fractionation and identification of iron-phosphorus compounds in sewage sludge.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784732,Chemosphere,2019 05 09,"Iron (Fe) salts are widely used to remove phosphorus (P) in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). Understanding the existing species of iron-phosphorus compounds (FePs) in sludge is conducive to P recovery. In this study, the chemical equilibrium modeling software, sequential chemical extraction methods and instrumental analytical techniques were used to establish a reliable method for fractionation and identification of FePs in sewage sludge. Five FePs-containing sludge samples obtained in the laboratory or from WWTPs were investigated. Modified chemical extraction methods for P and Fe fractionations combined with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis are preferable for qualitative and quantitative identification of FePs in sewage sludge. The analytical results revealed that more than half of P was bound to Fe in all the sludge samples. Approximately 83% and 14% of Fe was present as iron phosphates in the samples prepared in the laboratory with Fe(III) dosed to a phosphate solution and lab-scale secondary effluent, respectively. Ferrihydrite and hematite were the dominant iron oxides in these two samples, respectively. In the sludge samples collected from WWTPs, Fe bound to iron oxides (71%), mainly hematite, was the dominant Fe fraction in the returned sludge. Mature iron hydroxyphosphate together with some lepidocrocite was the dominant FePs in both the thickened sludge and mixed sludge before digestion.",Assessment of bacterial communities in Cu-contaminated soil immobilized by a one-time application of micro-/nano-hydroxyapatite and phytoremediation for 3 years.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784731,Chemosphere,2019 05 09,"Heavy metals contamination of soil has been considered as a global environmental problem, and consequently various soil amendments have been widely used in immobilization. Previous studies have reported that micro-/nano-hydroxyapatite (MHA/NHA) as a novel chemical material could alleviate soil acidity and reduce the bioavailability of heavy metals. However, the mechanism of soil microorganism responding to the application of MHA/NHA is little studied. Presently, an in-situ ﬁeld experiment was conducted to determine the eﬀects of MHA/NHA and the other three traditional amendments including alkali slag (AS), lime (L) and apatite (AP) on soil copper (Cu) bioavailability and dominate bacterial population. The results showed that the application of MHA/NHA effectively increased soil pH and decreased soil available Cu content, and showed the highest increasing effects on the activities of urease, catalase and acid phosphatase. Compared with the control, MHA/NHA significantly changed the soil bacterial community structure and increased the bacterial abundance and diversity. Besides, analysis of the dominate population showed that the application of MHA/NHA decreased the relative abundance of acidophiles and the indicator of soil degradation. Additionally, the relative abundance of potential plant growth promoting bacteria increased with the addition of MHA/NHA, which was confirmed by the characteristics (the ability of producing indole acetic acid and siderophore) of bacterial strains. These results suggested that these dominate bacterial populations with significant changes may be regarded as the biomarkers for the recovery of soil ecological environment, which provides a theoretical basis for the ecological evaluation of MHA/NHA.",Evidence for the widespread occurrence of short- and medium-chain chlorinated paraffins in fish collected from the Rhône River basin (France).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784730,Chemosphere,2019 05 09,"Chlorinated paraffins (CPs) are high-volume chemicals used in numerous industrial applications. Their quantitative analysis is extremely challenging and this work presents the optimization of an analytical method based on gas chromatography hyphenated with electron capture negative ionization time-of-flight high-resolution mass spectrometry (GC-ECNI-TOF HRMS) for the simultaneous determination of short-chain and medium-chain CPs (SCCPs and MCCPs, respectively) in fish tissues (i.e. dorsal muscle). The resolution of the TOF-MS analyzer reduced or eliminated isobaric interferences and the CP response was optimized through Design of Experiment. A simple clean-up procedure based on adsorption chromatography further removed some potentially interfering organochlorines. Good selectivity, linearity and accuracy were achieved; method detection limits or limits of reporting were compatible with expected levels in wild fish (0.03-0.35 ng g-1 wet weight, ww, depending on the congener). This method was proven suitable for the analysis of CPs in tissues of common barbel Barbus, a fish species frequently used for water quality monitoring purposes in Europe. SCCPs and MCCPs were found to be widespread within the Rhône river basin (France). At all locations, MCCP concentrations (1.3-72.7 ng g-1 ww) were higher than those of SCCPs (0.3-10.6 ng g-1 ww) and levels were systematically lower than the proposed Predicted No Effect Concentrations (PNECs). Spatial variations of SCCP composition profiles largely surpassed those of MCCPs, suggesting the influence of local sources.",Combination of soil organic and inorganic amendments helps plants overcome trace element induced oxidative stress and allows phytostabilisation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784729,Chemosphere,2019 05 09,"Trace element (TE)-contaminated soils require the improvement of their physico-chemical properties in order to allow their restoration through phytostabilization technologies. This study aimed to determine the usefulness of oxidative stress related parameters to validate the suitability of two different combinations of organic (solid fraction of pig slurry) and inorganic (paper mill sludge or a commercial red mud derivative) amendments for the phytostabilization of an acidic (4.2) TE-contaminated mine soil from SE Spain. Two wild species (Silybum marianum and Piptatherum miliaceum) were greenhouse cultivated and the development of the plants, their ionome, and oxidative stress related parameters were determined. Both amendment combinations increased significantly soil pH (to 5-6) and soil/pore water total organic C and total N concentrations, allowing an adequate plant growth and development (plants did not grow in untreated soils). The combination of amendments significantly reduced metal availability and showed to be effective (specially the one including the red mud derivative) in limiting shoot TE concentrations, which were all within common ranges (exclusion based tolerance of these species). Both protein carbonylation and lipid peroxidation were significantly higher in S. marianum plants from phytostabilized soils than in those from non-contaminated soils, which confirms the oxidative stress these plants suffer despite their satisfactory growth in the treated soils. P. miliaceum plants showed no differences between phytostabilized and non-contaminated soils. Therefore, the combination of amendments and TE-tolerant autochthonous species would be a suitable option for the phytostabilisation of soils contaminated by mining activities, reducing TE solubility and allowing an adequate plant growth.","Heavy metal contamination assessment of surface sediments of the Subei Shoal, China: Spatial distribution, source apportionment and ecological risk.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784728,Chemosphere,2019 05 09,"This study investigated heavy metals (Ni, Zn, Cr, Cu, As, Pb, Cd and Hg) concentrations in surface sediment of Subei Shoal, China, to illustrate their spatial distribution characteristics, sources and potential ecological risk of pollution. Contents of total organic carbon (TOC), clay, silt and sand were 1.7 ± 0.8%, 3.3 ± 3.2%, 13.6 ± 14.2% and 83.1 ± 17.4%, respectively. The spatial distribution of TOC, clay and silt were similar; however, distribution of Hg was inverse. Concentrations of Ni, Zn, Cr, Cu, As, Pb, Cd and Hg were 47.88 ± 8.93, 38.18 ± 8.86, 19.22 ± 5.14, 11.32 ± 5.07, 6.97 ± 2.45, 0.13 ± 0.72, 0.56 ± 0.77 and 0.06 ± 0.02 mg kg-1 sediment, respectively. Principal component analysis suggested that Cu, Zn, Cd, Cr and Ni were mainly derived from natural sources, whereas Pb, Cd, As and Hg from industrial and agricultural sources. Results of geo-accumulation index, potential ecological risk index (RI), pollution load index (PLI), toxic risk index (TRI) and contamination severity index (CSI) demonstrated that pollution levels of Cd and Hg were moderate, which should attract more attention as main pollution factors. The pollution was mainly distributed in the central and northern parts, and the southern part had a good ecological environment. Moreover, the contaminated stations accounted respective for 33.4%, 25.9%, 33.3% and 70.4% of RI, PLI, TRI and CSI, of which 70.4% of the contamination severity index stations contained 66.7% of much lower severity stations. These findings could contribute to more effective exploitation of tidal flat resources, and the prevention and treatment of tidal marsh environment.","The importance of systems thinking, context, and inclusion when studying the feasibility of expanding the FoodShare (SNAP) outreach program to rural communities of Northern Wisconsin.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784727,Evaluation and program planning,2019 04 18,"Evaluators often neglect to question whether a program has been appropriately designed for a new context prior to a feasibility study's commencement.

Anti-THSD7A autoantibodies are detected by Western blot and indirect immunofluorescence test (IIFT). Here, we developed a sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) optimized for quantitative detection of anti-THSD7A autoantibodies. Among 1012 biopsy-proven MN patients from 6 cohorts, 28 THSD7A-positive patients were identified by ELISA, indicating a prevalence of 2.8%. By screening additional patients, mostly referred because of PLA2R1-unrelated MN, we identified 21 more cases, establishing a cohort of 49 THSD7A-positive patients. Twenty-eight patients (57%) were male, and male patients were older than female patients (67 versus 49 years). Eight patients had a history of malignancy, but only 3 were diagnosed with malignancy within 2 years of MN diagnosis. We compared the results of ELISA, IIFT, Western blot, and biopsy staining, and found a significant correlation between ELISA and IIFT titers. Anti-THSD7A autoantibodies were predominantly IgG4 in all patients. Eight patients were double positive for THSD7A and PLA2R1. Levels of anti-THSD7A autoantibodies correlated with disease activity and with response to treatment. Patients with high titer at baseline had poor clinical outcome. In a subgroup of patients with serial titers, persistently elevated anti-THSD7A autoantibodies were observed in patients who did not respond to treatment or did not achieve remission. We conclude that the novel anti-THSD7A ELISA can be used to identify patients with THSD7A-associated MN and to monitor autoantibody titers during treatment.","Uncovering genetic mechanisms of kidney aging through transcriptomics, genomics, and epigenomics.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784661,Kidney international,2019 03 08,"Nephrons scar and involute during aging, increasing the risk of chronic kidney disease. Little is known, however, about genetic mechanisms of kidney aging. We sought to define the signatures of age on the renal transcriptome using 563 human kidneys. The initial discovery analysis of 260 kidney transcriptomes from the TRANScriptome of renaL humAn TissuE Study (TRANSLATE) and the Cancer Genome Atlas identified 37 age-associated genes. For 19 of those genes, the association with age was replicated in 303 kidney transcriptomes from the Nephroseq resource. Surveying 42 nonrenal tissues from the Genotype-Tissue Expression project revealed that, for approximately a fifth of the replicated genes, the association with age was kidney-specific. Seventy-three percent of the replicated genes were associated with functional or histological parameters of age-related decline in kidney health, including glomerular filtration rate, glomerulosclerosis, interstitial fibrosis, tubular atrophy, and arterial narrowing. Common genetic variants in four of the age-related genes, namely LYG1, PPP1R3C, LTF and TSPYL5, correlated with the trajectory of age-related changes in their renal expression. Integrative analysis of genomic, epigenomic, and transcriptomic information revealed that the observed age-related decline in renal TSPYL5 expression was determined both genetically and epigenetically. Thus, this study revealed robust molecular signatures of the aging kidney and new regulatory mechanisms of age-related change in the kidney transcriptome."

The patterns of mutations and copy number changes in carcinoma in situ and foci of carcinoma were almost identical, confirming their clonal origins.

These analyses are often hampered, however, by overwhelming quantities of human DNA, yielding only a small proportion of microbial reads for analysis. In addition, many abundant microbes in respiratory samples can produce large quantities of extracellular bacterial DNA originating either from biofilms or dead cells. We describe a method for simultaneously depleting DNA from intact human cells and extracellular DNA (human and bacterial) in sputum, using selective lysis of eukaryotic cells and endonuclease digestion. We show that this method increases microbial sequencing depth and, consequently, both the number of taxa detected and coverage of individual genes such as those involved in antibiotic resistance.

Here, we show that cellular H2O2 switches different apoptosis pathways depending on which type of Prx enzyme is absent. TNF-α-induced H2O2 burst preferentially activates the DNA damage-dependent apoptosis pathway in the absence of PrxI. By contrast, the same H2O2 burst stimulates the RIPK1-dependent apoptosis pathway in the absence of PrxII by inducing the destruction of cIAP1 in caveolar membrane. Specifically, H2O2 induces the oxidation of Cys308 residue in the cIAP1-BIR3 domain, which induces the dimerization-dependent E3 ligase activation. Thus, the reduction in cIAP level by the absence of PrxII triggers cell-autonomous apoptosis in cancer cells and tumors. Such differential functions of PrxI and PrxII are mediated by interaction with H2AX and cIAP1, respectively. Collectively, this study reveals the distinct switch roles of 2-Cys Prx isoforms in apoptosis signaling.",Mass Cytometry Analysis Reveals that Specific Intratumoral CD4+ T Cell Subsets Correlate with Patient Survival in Follicular Lymphoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784598,Cell reports,2019 03 08,"Follicular lymphoma (FL) is an indolent B cell malignancy characterized by an extensive but poorly functional T cell infiltrate in the tumor microenvironment.

ORP4L is expressed in LSCs but not in normal HSCs and is essential for LSC bioenergetics and survival. It extracts PIP2 from the plasma membrane and presents it to PLCβ3, enabling IP3 generation and subsequent Ca2+-dependent bioenergetics. LYZ-81 binds ORP4L competitively with PIP2 and blocks PIP2 hydrolysis, resulting in defective Ca2+ signaling. The results provide evidence that LSCs can be eradicated through the inhibition of ORP4L by LYZ-81, which may serve as a starting point of drug development for the elimination of LSCs to eventually cure leukemia.",AMPK Promotes Xenophagy through Priming of Autophagic Kinases upon Detection of Bacterial Outer Membrane Vesicles.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784596,Cell reports,2019 02 20,"The autophagy pathway is an essential facet of the innate immune response, capable of rapidly targeting intracellular bacteria. However, the initial signaling regulating autophagy induction in response to pathogens remains largely unclear. Here, we report that AMPK, an upstream activator of the autophagy pathway, is stimulated upon detection of pathogenic bacteria, before bacterial invasion. Bacterial recognition occurs through the detection of outer membrane vesicles. We found that AMPK signaling relieves mTORC1-mediated repression of the autophagy pathway in response to infection, positioning the cell for a rapid induction of autophagy. Moreover, activation of AMPK and inhibition of mTORC1 in response to bacteria is not accompanied by an induction of bulk autophagy. However, AMPK signaling is required for the selective targeting of bacteria-containing vesicles by the autophagy pathway through the activation of pro-autophagic kinase complexes. These results demonstrate a key role for AMPK signaling in coordinating the rapid autophagic response to bacteria.",eIF4A3 Phosphorylation by CDKs Affects NMD during the Cell Cycle.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784594,Cell reports,2019 02 20,"Exon junction complexes (EJCs) loaded onto spliced mRNAs during splicing serve as molecular markers for various post-transcriptional gene-regulatory processes, including nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD). Although the composition and structure of EJCs are well characterized, the mechanism regulating EJC deposition remains unknown. Here we find that threonine 163 (T163) within the RNA-binding motif of eIF4A3 (a core EJC component) is phosphorylated by cyclin-dependent protein kinases 1 and 2 in a cell cycle-dependent manner. T163 phosphorylation hinders binding of eIF4A3 to spliced mRNAs and other EJC components. Instead, it promotes association of eIF4A3 with CWC22, which guides eIF4A3 to an active spliceosome. These molecular events ensure the fidelity of specific deposition of the EJC ∼20-24 nt upstream of an exon-exon junction. Accordingly, NMD is affected by T163 phosphorylation. Collectively, our data provide evidence that T163 phosphorylation affects EJC formation and, consequently, NMD efficiency in a cell cycle-dependent manner.",Dynamics of the Eukaryotic Replicative Helicase at Lagging-Strand Protein Barriers Support the Steric Exclusion Model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784593,Cell reports,2019 03 02,"Progression of DNA replication depends on the ability of the replisome complex to overcome nucleoprotein barriers. During eukaryotic replication, the CMG helicase translocates along the leading-strand template and unwinds the DNA double helix. While proteins bound to the leading-strand template efficiently block the helicase, the impact of lagging-strand protein obstacles on helicase translocation and replisome progression remains controversial. Here, we show that CMG and replisome progressions are impaired when proteins crosslinked to the lagging-strand template enhance the stability of duplex DNA. In contrast, proteins that exclusively interact with the lagging-strand template influence neither the translocation of isolated CMG nor replisome progression in Xenopus egg extracts. Our data imply that CMG completely excludes the lagging-strand template from the helicase central channel while unwinding DNA at the replication fork, which clarifies how two CMG helicases could freely cross one another during replication initiation and termination.",Interactions between N-terminal Modules in MPS1 Enable Spindle Checkpoint Silencing.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784592,Cell reports,2019 02 20,"Faithful chromosome segregation relies on the ability of the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) to delay anaphase onset until chromosomes are attached to the mitotic spindle via their kinetochores. MPS1 kinase is recruited to kinetochores to initiate SAC signaling and is removed from kinetochores once stable microtubule attachments have been formed to allow normal mitotic progression. Here, we show that a helical fragment within the kinetochore-targeting N-terminal extension (NTE) module of MPS1 is required for interactions with kinetochores and forms intramolecular interactions with its adjacent tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain. Bypassing this NTE-TPR interaction results in high MPS1 levels at kinetochores due to loss of regulatory input into MPS1 localization, inefficient MPS1 delocalization upon microtubule attachment, and SAC silencing defects. These results show that SAC responsiveness to attachments relies on regulated intramolecular interactions in MPS1 and highlight the sensitivity of mitosis to perturbations in the dynamics of the MPS1-NDC80-C interactions.",Decoupling the Roles of Cell Shape and Mechanical Stress in Orienting and Cueing Epithelial Mitosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784591,Cell reports,2019 03 02,"Distinct mechanisms involving cell shape and mechanical force are known to influence the rate and orientation of division in cultured cells. However, uncoupling the impact of shape and force in tissues remains challenging. Combining stretching of Xenopus tissue with mathematical methods of inferring relative mechanical stress, we find separate roles for cell shape and mechanical stress in orienting and cueing division. We demonstrate that division orientation is best predicted by an axis of cell shape defined by the position of tricellular junctions (TCJs), which align with local cell stress rather than tissue-level stress. The alignment of division to cell shape requires functional cadherin and the localization of the spindle orientation protein, LGN, to TCJs but is not sensitive to relative cell stress magnitude. In contrast, proliferation rate is more directly regulated by mechanical stress, being correlated with relative isotropic stress and decoupled from cell shape when myosin II is depleted."

Currently, less invasive surgery has reemerged and is increasingly used. The sinus tarsi approach is most commonly used. It combines the open approach to the subtalar joint with percutaneous reduction of the overall shape of the calcaneus. The results in the literature show overall similar functional outcome compared with the extended lateral approach, however with a significant reduction in wound complications.

The bioheat equation was solved subject to two boundary conditions at the skin surface: a prescribed skin temperature satisfying the Fanger comfort criterion, and a prescribed heat flux obtained from the overall energy balance for the system. In addition to a fixed body core temperature, an adiabatic condition was imposed as an auxiliary condition at the core of the body, and a pair of equations were derived, relating the blood perfusion and the volumetric heat generation rate for a given activity level and environmental conditions. By solving the two equations, we determined the functional dependence of blood perfusion and metabolic heat generation on the human activity level. For convenience, we presented simple explicit expressions for the key relations, with the aid of asymptotic analyses. Additional results include the temperature distribution inside the muscle layer, and the effects of muscle and fat layer thickness on the heat transfer processes.",Ambient temperature preferences of chimney swifts (Chaetura pelagica) for Nest Site Selection.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784493,Journal of thermal biology,2019 04 15,"Chimney swift (Chaetura pelagica) populations are declining rapidly, with no clear indication as to why. Reduced availability of nesting habitat (chimneys) was thought to be a limiting factor for this threatened species, but data from Ontario, Canada did not support this hypothesis. If availability is not limiting, then perhaps habitat quality may play a role. We examined the thermal aspect of chimneys that are used by nesting swifts. To do so, we identified upper and lower thermal limits influencing the selection of chimneys for nesting. Across Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, we deployed temperature loggers in 19 chimneys, 11 of which contained chimney swift nests and 8 that were deemed suitable for nesting but were not occupied. Temperature readings were recorded at 30-min intervals from 23 June to 15 September 2017. We found that chimney occupancy by swifts was negatively correlated with maximum and mean chimney temperature. We did not find a relationship between occupancy and minimum temperature, temperature fluctuations, or chimney material. These results indicate that chimney swifts are preferentially selecting cooler chimneys for nesting.",Normative surface skin temperature changes due to blood redistribution: A prospective study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784492,Journal of thermal biology,2019 04 15,"The continuing development and manufacture of infrared devices, together with improvements in thermal body mapping techniques have simplified surface skin thermography which is being used more extensively than ever before. Normative thermography data, however, remains incomplete. A normative blood redistribution range of skin temperatures was established for use as a reference for laboratory infrared thermography (IT), thermal body mapping, and mass fever screenings. 500 healthy volunteers participated in this prospective study. To determine the maximum range of the skin temperature changes due to the posture-related physiological blood redistribution, the volunteers were asked to keep one extremity up and another extremity down whilst lying, sitting, and standing. We obtained 6000 hand and 400 foot temperature readings. The normal temperature was 29.1 ± 0.6 °C for the middle fingers and 27.8 ± 0.7 °C for the toes. The physiological temperature change during body position changes ranged from 4 to 6 °C (fingers: 27-31 °C; toes: 26-32 °C). At normal room temperature, the surface skin temperature may vary within this range due to blood redistribution. These changes reflect the individual variability of vasomotor activity. This physiological range of temperatures should be taken into account during IT and other thermography-involved investigations.",Effect of thermal manipulation during embryogenesis on the promoter methylation and expression of myogenesis-related genes in duck skeletal muscle.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784491,Journal of thermal biology,2019 04 15,"Avian embryos are an ideal system to investigate the effect of incubation temperature on embryonic development, but the characteristics and mechanisms of temperature effects on poultry embryonic myogenesis are unclear. In this study, we investigated the effect of increasing the incubation temperature by 1 °C on the expression of nine myogenesis-related genes in ducks and then explored the correlation between the alteration of promoter methylation and the expression of two of the nine genes under thermal manipulation (TM). The qRT-PCR results showed that TM during embryonic days (ED) 1-10 promoted (P < 0.05) the expression of genes in breast muscle (PAX3, PAX7, MYOG, MCK, SIX1, TNNC1) and leg muscle (MYOD, MYOG, MYF5, MCK, AKIRIN2, TNNC1). TM during ED10-20 promoted the expression of PAX3, MYF5 and MCK and inhibited AKIRIN2 expression in breast muscle (P < 0.05); however, it inhibited the expression of PAX3, PAX7, MYOD, MYOG, MYF5, SIX1, AKIRIN2 and TNNC1 and promoted MCK expression in leg muscle (P < 0.05). TM during ED20-27 inhibited the expression of genes in breast muscle (PAX7) and leg muscle (MYOD, MYOG, MYF5, TNNC1) and promoted MCK expression in breast and leg muscle (P < 0.05). Furthermore, with the Sequenom MassARRAY platform, it was observed that the average methylation level of AKIRIN2 (ED10) and TNNC1 (ED20) in leg muscle decreased (P < 0.05) after TM. Notably, we found significant (P < 0.05) inverse correlations between the methylation and mRNA levels of AKIRIN2 under TM during ED1-10 (r = - 0.969) and ED10-20 (r = - 0.805). Taken together, TM during ED1-10 was more favorable for improving duck myogenesis-related gene expression than TM during ED10-20 and ED20-27. TM during duck embryogenesis seemed to have a greater effect on the development of leg muscle than breast muscle and might alter AKIRIN2 expression by changing its promoter methylation status. These findings may be helpful to understand temperature effects on the muscle development of avian embryos and to explore the role of epigenetic regulation during this process."

We therefore investigated the thermal limits for growth and development of Vriesea friburgensis and Alcantarea imperialis seedlings in the context of oxidative stress. The optimal temperatures for the growth of V. friburgensis and A. imperialis were 25 and 25-30 °C, respectively. Extreme temperatures (15, 30, or 35 °C) induced oxidative stress in both species with significant accumulation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and nitric oxide (NO). Under oxidative stress, the amount of chlorophyll decreased in both species, more prominently in V. friburgensis, while carotenoid levels dramatically increased in A. imperialis. Notably, the activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase (CAT), and ascorbate peroxidase increased in A. imperialis at extreme temperatures. Similar results were observed for V. friburgensis; however, the activity of CAT remained unaffected regardless of temperature. Seedlings of A. imperialis survived at a wider range of temperatures than V. friburgensis, which had greater than 40% mortality when growing at 30 °C. Overall, precise control of cellular H2O2 and NO levels takes place during the establishment of A. imperialis seedlings, allowing the species to cope with relatively high temperatures. The thermal limits of the fundamental niches of the species investigated, determined based on the ability of seedlings to cope with oxidative stress, were distinct from the realized niches of these species. The results suggest that recruitment success is dependent on the ability of seedlings to handle extreme temperature-triggered oxidative stress, which limits the regeneration niche.",Addition of grape pomace flour in the diet on laying hens in heat stress: Impacts on health and performance as well as the fatty acid profile and total antioxidant capacity in the egg.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784478,Journal of thermal biology,2019 04 15,"The aim of this study was to evaluate whether the addition of grape pomace flour (GPF) in the diet of laying hens at the end of the productive cycle and on heat stress could exert benefits on their health and performance, as well as egg quality. For this, 74-week-old laying hens (n = 64) were divided into four groups with four repetitions each, as follow: T0 (the control group; without GPF), T1 (1% GPF), T2 (2% GPF) and T3 (3% GPF) during 35 days. Percentage of laid eggs was higher in the group T1 compared to T0, and the feed intake was higher in the groups T1, T2 and T3 compared to T0. There was no difference regarding the chemical-physical composition of fresh eggs; however, eggs from GPF-fed chickens showed changes after storage regarding specific gravity, yolk index, pH of yolk, albumen and Haugh unit compared to T0. Fresh or stored egg yolk from GPF groups showed higher antioxidant capacity and lower lipid peroxidation compared to T0. GPF (3%) prevented the reduction of monounsaturated fatty acids in the yolk of stored eggs compared to T0. Glutathione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase activities, as well as total antioxidant capacity against peroxyl radicals were higher in the serum of laying hens that received GPF compared to T0, while lipid peroxidation was lower. In summary, the addition of GPF in the diet for laying hens at the end of the productive cycle can be beneficial for animal health and exerted positive effects in their performance and egg quality.",Temperature-induced changes in reproductive variables in the teleost fish Lophiosilurus alexandri.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784477,Journal of thermal biology,2019 04 15,"The present study evaluates whether increased water temperature induces reproduction by Lophiosilurus alexandri under controlled conditions, and investigates the effects of this procedure on sexual steroids, hematological profile and behavior.

Water temperature was maintained at 24.4 ± 1.0 °C for weeks 1-22, and then at 29.0 ± 1.1 °C for weeks 22-44. Spawn weight, number of eggs/spawn and hatching rate were satisfactory and ranged 27.5-127.5 g, 1209-5183 and 83-89%, respectively. Hematocrit, leukocytes and glucose were not influenced by increased water temperature, while higher values for erythrocytes were observed for both sexes. The lowest value for plasma protein was for females maintained at 29.0 °C, while the lowest value for testosterone was obtained at the end of the study period at a temperature in 29.0 °C. Serum values of 17β-estradiol were higher in females than in males, however, there was no evidence of variation as a function of experimental temperature or interaction with sex. The reproductive behavior of L. alexandri in captivity is described for the first time. The present study demonstrates that adult individuals are able to maintain a stable hematological profile during an increase in mean water temperature from 24.4 °C to 29.0 °C, even during the reproductive period, and still produce good quality larvae. Nonetheless, whether spawning was associated with increased 17β-estradiol levels could not be determined.",Repeatability of thermal reaction norms for spontaneous locomotor activity in juvenile newts.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784476,Journal of thermal biology,2019 04 15,"Locomotor activity is a major attribute of animals. Although this trait determines important ecological processes, such as dispersal and species interactions, the sources of its variation are not fully understood. We examined the influence of body temperature (13, 18, 23, and 28 °C) and individual identity on spontaneous locomotor activity in juvenile alpine newts, Ichthyosaura alpestris, over three consecutive weeks. Locomotor activity was characterized by four parameters: distance covered, mean velocity, frequency of movements, and total activity rate (all directional and non-directional movements). Apart from total activity rate, thermal reaction norms for locomotor parameters had convex or concave curvilinear shapes. During the first trial series, i.e. across the four body temperatures that were tested, individual identity explained less variation in thermal reaction norms than during the second series. Individual means, i.e. the vertical positions of individual thermal reaction norms, were repeatable between trial series in all locomotor activity parameters but the frequency of movements. We conclude that spontaneous locomotor activity is a complex trait, which can be characterized by several parameters with varying individual repeatability and thermal dependency. This information should be considered for planning further locomotor activity experiments, conservation strategies, and modeling ectotherm responses to climate change.",Urban heat islands advance the timing of reproduction in a social insect.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784475,Journal of thermal biology,2019 04 15,"For many species, the timing of life cycle events is advancing under contemporary global climate change. However, much less is known regarding phenological shifts as a result of other sources of anthropogenic change, such as urban warming. In both cases, progress has been hampered by a focus on phenological traits such as the timing of emergence, rather than the phenology of more directly related fitness traits such as the timing of reproduction. Here we explore how urban heat island effects shape the timing of reproduction in an acorn-dwelling ant. We used a common garden experiment with acorn ants collected from three cities in the eastern United States along a latitudinal gradient and reared long-term in the laboratory under five temperature treatments. This allowed us to quantify the effects of temperature on reproductive phenology across three scales-a biogeographic temperature cline, three urban vs. rural temperature comparisons, and five laboratory rearing temperatures. At our northernmost and southernmost cities (spanning 6° of latitude), we found both urbanization and warmer laboratory rearing temperature significantly advanced reproductive phenology; ants from the lowest latitude city also had earlier reproductive phenology compared with the higher latitude cities. In the field, the differences in urban versus rural acorn ant reproductive phenology translate to approximately one month earlier reproduction in the urban populations. For insects with synchronous mating events, such as ants, shifts in the already short window of time to reproduce could limit mating across environments, potentially leading to reproductive isolation between urban and rural populations.",Expression levels of HSP70 and CPT-1 in three local breeds of chickens reared under normal or heat stress conditions after the introduction of the naked neck gene.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784474,Journal of thermal biology,2019 04 15,"The naked neck gene was introduced by crossbreeding into Egyptian breeds to improve body weight. Expression levels of HSP70 and CPT-1 were used to assess the heat tolerance of three Egyptian local breeds (Fayoumi, Dandarawi and Sinai) with and without the naked neck gene and under normal and heat stress conditions. There were two genotypes from each breed that had the same genetic origin (the naked neck and normal plumage genotypes). For each genotype, chicks were divided into two groups, a control group and a treated group. Chicks in the treated group were subjected to heat stress (40 °C) for four hours when they were between 3 and 5 days old. This treatment was associated with a highly significant increase in HSP70 and CPT-1 gene expression for the Dandarawi breed compared to the levels in the Fayoumi and Sinai breeds. Moreover, the introduction of the naked neck gene into these local breeds caused marked increases in CPT-1 gene expression, but these increases did not significantly differ among different naked neck genotypes. Therefore, it could be concluded that the Dandarawi breed exhibited the best heat tolerance, followed by the Sinai breed, whereas the Fayoumi breed was inferior in this respect. Furthermore, the naked neck gene improved heat tolerance by increasing HSP70 gene expression rather than only by reducing feather cover. The results obtained recommended using the Sinia naked neck chicken as a male line in commercial parent stock to produce broiler chicks adapted to the hot and warm climates.","Influence of a physical exercise until exhaustion in normothermic and hyperthermic conditions on serum, erythrocyte and urinary concentrations of magnesium and phosphorus.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784472,Journal of thermal biology,2019 04 15,The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of the performance of a maximal exercise test until exhaustion in normothermic and hyperthermic conditions on body concentrations of magnesium (Mg) and phosphorus (P).,Write a Scientific Paper (WASP): Miscellaneous practical and material aspects - part 2.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784469,Early human development,2019 06 13,"This WASP (Write a Scientific Paper) Best Practice Guidelines (BPG) will wrap up all of the aspects pertaining to qualitative analyses as well as some more theoretical aspects of paper writing.

A biochar was used as a stabilization agent to remediate Cu- and Pb-contaminated sediments, collected from three locations in or close to Beijing. The sediments were mixed with a palm sawdust gasified biochar at a range of weight ratios (2.5%, 5%, and 10%) and incubated for 10, 30, or 60 days. The performance of the different treatments and the heavy metal fractions in the sediments were assessed using four extraction methods, including diffusive gradients in thin films, the porewater concentration, a sequential extraction, and the toxicity characteristic leaching procedure. The results showed that biochar could enhance the stability of heavy metals in contaminated sediments. The degree of stability increased as both the dose of biochar and the incubation time increased. The sediment pH and the morphology of the metal crystals adsorbed onto the biochar changed as the contact time increased. Our results showed that adsorption, metal crystallization, and the pH were the main controls on the stabilization of metals in contaminated sediment by biochar.","Comparison of mixing layer height inversion algorithms using lidar and a pollution case study in Baoding, China.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784467,Journal of environmental sciences (China),2019 03 11,"Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei area is suffering from atmospheric pollution from a long time. The understanding of the air pollution mechanism is of great importance for officials to design strategies for the environmental governance. Mixing layer height (MLH) is a key factor influencing the diffusion of air pollutants. It plays an important role on the evolution of heavy pollution events. Light detection and ranging (lidar), is an effective remote-sensing tool, which can retrieve high spatial and temporal evolution process within mixing layer (ML), especially the variation of MLH. There are many methods to retrieve MLH, but each method has its own applicable limitations. The Mie-lidar data in Beijing was firstly used to compare three different algorithms which are widely used under different pollution levels. We find that the multi-layer structure near surface may cause errors in the detection of mixing layer. The MLH retrieved based on image edge detection was better than another two methods especially under heavy polluted episode. Then we applied this method to investigate the evolution of the mixing layer height during a pollution episode in December 2016. MLH at Gucheng county showed the positive correlation with the concentration of particulate matters during the start of this pollution episode. The elevated pollution level in Gucheng was not associated with MLH's decrease, and the significantly increased particulate matters raised the boundary layer, which trapped the pollutants near the surface."

Cysteamine which was used as the ligand for Hg(II) complexation, was grafted along the epichlorohydrin crosslinked carboxylated carboxymethyl cellulose polymer chain through an amide reaction. The adsorption ability of S-IIPs towards Hg(II) was investigated by kinetic and isotherm models, which, corresponding, showed that the adsorption process followed a pseudo-second-order, fitted well with the Langmuir isotherm with a maximum adsorption capacity of 80 mg/g. Moreover, thermodynamic studies indicated an endothermic and spontaneous reaction with the tendency of an enhanced randomness at the surface of the S-IIPs with temperature increases. S-IIPs indicated a high degree of selectivity towards Hg(II) in the presence of Cu2+, Zn2+, Co2+, Pb2+ and Cd2+. Furthermore, the efficiency of S-IIPs was also evaluated against real samples showing 86.78%, 91.88%, and 99.10% recovery for Hg(II) wastewater, ground water and tap water, respectively.

The deposition of sulfate significantly enhanced the catalytic performance over CeO2. NOx conversion over 4H2SO4/CeO2 at 230-440 °C was higher than 90%. The strong redox capability of CeO2 could result in unselective NH3 oxidation and decrease high temperatures catalytic activity and N2 selectivity. The deposition of sulfate increased the acidity and weakened the redox capability, and then increased the high temperature NOx conversion and N2 selectivity. An appropriate level of acidity also promoted the activity at 190-250 °C over ceria-based catalysts, and with further increase in the acidity, the SCR activity decreased slightly. Weak redox capability lowered the low-temperature catalytic activity. Excellent SCR activity requires a balance of acidity and redox capability on the catalysts.",Stable-isotope probing of bacterial community for dissolved inorganic carbon utilization in Microcystis aeruginosa-dominated eutrophic water.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784450,Journal of environmental sciences (China),2019 03 11,"Dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) is an important source of carbon in aquatic ecosystems, especially under conditions of increased frequency of cyanobacterial bloom. However, the importance of bacteria in direct or indirect utilization of DIC has been widely overlooked in eutrophic freshwater. To identify the functional bacteria that can actively utilize DIC in eutrophic freshwater during cyanobacterial bloom, stable-isotope probing (SIP) experiments were conducted on eutrophic river water with or without inoculation with cyanobacteria (Microcystis aeruginosa). Our 16S rRNA sequencing results revealed the significance of Betaproteobacteria, with similar relative abundance as Alphaproteobacteria, in the active assimilation of H13CO3- into their DNA directly or indirectly, which include autotrophic genera Betaproteobacterial ammonia-oxidizing bacteria. Other bacterial groups containing autotrophic members, e.g. Planctomycetes and Nitrospira, also presented higher abundance among free-living bacteria in water without cyanobacteria. Microcystis aggregates showed a preference for some specific bacterial members that may utilize H13CO3- metabolized by Microcystis as organic matter, e.g. Bacteroidetes (Cytophagales, Sphingobacteriales), and microcystin-degrading bacteria Betaproteobacteria (Paucibacter/Burkholderiaceae). This study provides some valuable information regarding the functional bacteria that can actively utilize DIC in eutrophic freshwater.",Differences of the oxidation process and secondary organic aerosol formation at low and high precursor concentrations.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784449,Journal of environmental sciences (China),2019 03 11,"Current atmospheric quality models usually underestimate the level of ambient secondary organic aerosol (SOA), one of the possible reasons is that the precursors at different concentrations may undergo different oxidation processes and further affect SOA formation. Therefore, there is a need to perform more chamber studies to disclose the influence. In this work, SOA formation over a wide range of initial precursor concentrations (tens of ppb to hundreds of ppb levels) was investigated in a 30 m3 indoor smog chamber, and mainly through the analysis of multiple generations of VOCs detected from HR-ToF-PTRMS to expound the difference in the oxidation process between low and high precursor concentrations. Compared to high initial concentrations, gas-phase intermediates formed at low concentrations had a higher intensity by about one order of magnitude, and the low-volatility compounds also had a higher formation potential due to the competition between semi-volatile intermediates and precursors with oxidants. In addition, the formed SOA was more oxidized with higher f44 value (0.14 ± 0.02) and more relevant to real atmosphere than that formed at high concentrations. This work should help to deeply understand SOA formation and improve the performance of air quality models for SOA simulation.",Investigating the coagulation of non-proteinaceous algal organic matter: Optimizing coagulation performance and identification of removal mechanisms.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784448,Journal of environmental sciences (China),2019 03 11,"The removal of algal organic matter (AOM) is a growing concern for the water treatment industry worldwide. The current study investigates coagulation of non-proteinaceous AOM (AOM after protein separation), which has been minimally explored compared with proteinaceous fractions. Jar tests with either aluminum sulphate (alum) or polyaluminium chloride (PACl) were performed at doses of 0.2-3.0 mg Al per 1 mg of dissolved organic carbon in the pH range 3.0-10.5. Additionally, non-proteinaceous matter was characterized in terms of charge, molecular weight and carbohydrate content to assess the treatability of its different fractions. Results showed that only up to 25% of non-proteinaceous AOM can be removed by coagulation under optimized conditions. The optimal coagulation pH (6.6-8.0 for alum and 7.5-9.0 for PACl) and low surface charge of the removed fraction indicated that the prevailing coagulation mechanism was adsorption of non-proteinaceous matter onto aluminum hydroxide precipitates. The lowest residual Al concentrations were achieved in very narrow pH ranges, especially in the case of PACl. High-molecular weight saccharide-like organics were amenable to coagulation compared to low-molecular weight (<3 kDa) substances. Their high content in non-proteinaceous matter (about 67%) was the reason for its low removal. Comparison with our previous studies implies that proteinaceous and non-proteinaceous matter is coagulated under different conditions due to the employment of diverse coagulation mechanisms. The study suggests that further research should focus on the removal of low-molecular weight AOM, reluctant to coagulate, with other treatment processes to minimize its detrimental effect on water safety.",Enhanced adsorption of arsenate by spinel zinc ferrite nano particles: Effect of zinc content and site occupation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784447,Journal of environmental sciences (China),2019 03 11,"In this work, zinc ferrite spinel with different zinc contents (ZnxFe3-xO4) was synthesized by a hydrothermal method and used for removing As(V) in aqueous solution. X-ray diffraction (XRD) results indicated that in the crystal structure of ZnxFe3-xO4, the zinc atoms tended to occupy the octahedral sites for x < 0.6 and diffused into the tetrahedral sites gradually with x > 0.6. The size of ZnxFe3-xO4 crystallites increased with the increasing zinc content. Batch adsorption experiments showed that the adsorption isotherms could be well described by the Langmuir model, while the adsorption kinetics followed the pseudo-second-order kinetic model. Zinc ferrite exhibited the highest adsorption capacity towards As(V) when x = 0.6. Study of the mechanism indicated that doping with zinc increased the number of surface hydroxyl groups on ferrite spinel, and thus enhanced the adsorption capacity when x = 0.6. This work revealed the effects of doping site and content of metal atoms on the adsorption ability of ferrite spinel towards As(V).","Long-term impacts of graphene oxide and Ag nanoparticles on anammox process: Performance, microbial community and toxic mechanism.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784446,Journal of environmental sciences (China),2019 03 11,"The increasing application of engineered nanoparticles (NPs) has posed an emerging challenge to constructed wetland wastewater treatment. The performance, microbial community and toxic mechanism of anammox-based unplanted subsurface-flow constructed wetlands (USFCWs) were investigated under the long-term exposure of different graphene oxides (GOs) and Ag NP concentrations. Results showed that the addition of GO could promote TN removal, manifesting as function anammox bacteria C. Anammoxoglobus having a relative high abundance, for GO did not cause significant damage to the cell integrity though there was an increase in ROS concentrations. TN removal would not be obviously affected under exposure of 1 mg/L Ag NPs, for the function gene related to cell biogenesis and repair was up-regulated; while the addition of 10 mg/L Ag NPs would have an inhibiting effect on TN removal in the USFCWs, for the disappearance of some species having anammox ability. Key enzymes of anammox process (NIR and HDH) decreased to some extent under GO and Ag NP exposure, and function gene of defense mechanisms had an increase trend in samples.",Process analysis of PM2.5 pollution events in a coastal city of China using CMAQ.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784445,Journal of environmental sciences (China),2019 03 11,"US EPA's Community Multiscale Air Quality modeling system (CMAQ) with Process Analysis tool was used to simulate and quantify the contribution of individual atmospheric processes to PM2.5 concentration in Qingdao during three representative PM2.5 pollution events in the winter of 2015 and 2016. Compared with the observed surface PM2.5 concentrations, CMAQ could reasonably reproduce the temporal and spatial variations of PM2.5 during these three events. Process analysis results show that primary emissions accounted for 72.7%-93.2% of the accumulation of surface PM2.5 before and after the events. When the events occurred, primary emissions were still the major contributor to the increase of PM2.5 in Qingdao, however the contribution percentage reduced significantly, which only account for 51.4%-71.8%. Net contribution from horizontal and vertical transport to the accumulation of PM2.5 was also positive and its percentage increased when events occurred. Only 1.1%-4.6% of aerosol accumulation was due to PM processes and aqueous chemical processes before and after events. When the events occurred, contribution from PM processes and aqueous chemistry increased to 6.0%-11.8%. Loss of PM2.5 was mainly through horizontal transport, vertical transport and dry deposition, no matter during or outside the events. Wet deposition would become the main removal pathway of PM2.5, when precipitation occurred.",Kinetic study on photocatalytic degradation of Acid Orange 52 in a baffled reactor using TiO2 nanoparticles.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784444,Journal of environmental sciences (China),2019 03 11,"In this study, a baffled photocatalytic reactor was used for the treatment of colored wastewater containing the azo dye of Acid Orange 52 (AO52). A study on the active species of the photocatalytic process using TiO2 nanoparticles indicated that hydroxyl radical and superoxide have the greatest contribution to the dye degradation process respectively. Given that a level of biological oxygen demand/chemical oxygen demand (BOD5/COD) equal to 0.4 was achieved after about 5 hr from the beginning of the experiment, the reactor seems to be capable of purifying the wastewater containing AO52 dye after this time in order to discharge into a biological treatment system to continue the treatment process. The results of the liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) test showed that during the first 4 hr of the experiment, with the breakdown of the azo bond, the contaminant was decomposed into the benzene annular compounds with less toxicity indicating a reduction in the toxicity of wastewater after removing the dye agent. The study on the kinetics of these reactions followed the pseudo-first-order kinetic model in all conditions and corresponded well to Langmuir-Hinshelwood model. According to the kinetic model for the simultaneous occurrence of possible pathways, the kinetic constant of production and degradation of intermediate products in optimal conditions was estimated to be between 0.0029 and 0.0391 min-1.","Soil contamination with antibiotics in a typical peri-urban area in eastern China: Seasonal variation, risk assessment, and microbial responses.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784443,Journal of environmental sciences (China),2019 03 11,"The prevalence and persistence of antibiotics in soils has become an emerging environmental issue and an increasing threat to soil security and global public health. The problem is more severe in areas undergoing rapid urbanization; however, the ecological risks of antibiotics, seasonal variability, and associated soil microbial responses in peri-urban soils have not been well-explored. The seasonal soil sampling campaigns were conducted in a typical peri-urban watershed in eastern China to investigate distribution of antibiotics. The results demonstrated higher mean concentrations of most antibiotic compounds in winter than in summer in peri-urban soils. The seasonal variations of norfloxacin, enrofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin were more significant than those of other antibiotics, due to their higher migration ability and bioavailability. An ecological risk assessment demonstrated that chlortetracycline, ciprofloxacin, doxycycline, and ofloxacin can pose high risks to soil microorganisms. Furthermore, the coexistence of multiple antibiotics obviously poses higher risks than individual compounds. A redundancy analysis demonstrated that tetracyclines mainly showed negative correlations with Firmicutes and Chloroflexi, and quinolones showed obviously negative correlations with Acidobacteria, Gemmatimonadetes, and Nitrospirae, suggesting potential inhibition from antibiotics on biological activities or biodegradation processes. However, the persistence of antibiotics in soil results in a significant decrease in bacterial diversity and a change in dominant species. Our results provide an overview of the seasonal variability of antibiotics and the associated effects on bacterial communities in peri-urban soils. The results can provide scientific guidance on decreasing soil contamination with antibiotics to enhance soil security in similar areas."

However, construction of biosynthetic pathways always suffers from side reactions, toxicity of intermediates, or low efficiency of substrate channeling. Subcellular compartmentalization may contribute to a more efficient production of target products by reducing side reactions and toxic effects within a compact insular space. The peroxisome, a type of organelle that is involved in catabolism of fatty acids and reactive oxygen species, has attracted a great deal of attention in the construction of eukaryotic cell factories with little impact on essential cellular function. In this chapter, we will systematically review recent advances in peroxisomal compartmentalization for microbial production of valuable biomolecules. Additionally, detailed experimental designs and protocols are also described. We hope a comprehensive understanding of peroxisomes will promote their application in metabolic engineering and synthetic biology."

However, pathway development and optimization can be arduous tasks, complicated by pathway bottlenecks and toxicity. Pathway organization has emerged as a potential solution to these issues, and the use of protein- or DNA-based scaffolds has successfully increased the production of several industrially relevant compounds. These efforts demonstrate the usefulness of pathway colocalization and spatial organization for metabolic engineering applications. In particular, scaffolding within an enclosed, subcellular compartment shows great promise for pathway optimization, offering benefits such as increased local enzyme and substrate concentrations, sequestration of toxic or volatile intermediates, and alleviation of cofactor and resource competition with the host.

Several authorities have suggested that changing the name, for example to psychosis, would reduce such stigmatisation. We aimed to compare attitudes to schizophrenia and psychosis on Twitter to see if psychosis was associated with less negative attitudes. Tweets containing the terms 'schizophrenia', 'schizophrenic', 'psychosis' or 'psychotic' were collected on www.twitter.com and were captured with NCapture. On NVivo, tweets were coded into categories based on user type, tweet content, attitude and stigma type by two independent raters. We compared the content and attitudes of tweets referring to schizophrenia/schizophrenic and psychosis/psychotic. RESULTS: A total of 1120 tweets referring to schizophrenia/schizophrenic and 1080 referring to psychosis/psychotic were identified over two 7-day periods; 424 original tweets for schizophrenia and 416 original tweets for psychosis were included in the analysis. Psychosis was significantly more commonly included in tweets expressing negative attitudes (n=131, 31.5%) than schizophrenia (n=41, 9.7%) (χ² = 237.03, P &lt; 0.0001). Of the personal opinions or dyadic interactions, 125 (53.4%) in the psychosis data set were stigmatising, compared with 33 (24.6%) of those in the schizophrenia set (χ² = 44.65, P &lt; 0.0001).Clinical implicationsThe terms psychosis/psychotic are associated with a significantly higher number of tweets with negative content than schizophrenia/schizophrenic. Together with other evidence, this suggests that changing the name of schizophrenia to psychosis will not reduce negative attitudes toward the condition.Declaration of interestS.L. has received personal fees from Otsuka and Sunovion, and personal and research fees from Janssen."

We hypothesized that druggable molecular pathways underlying the defect can be revealed through phenotypic small-molecule screens. Accordingly, a screening assay was developed using c-kit+ fetal liver erythroid progenitors from a doxycycline-inducible DBA mouse model. The addition of doxycycline to the culture medium induces the phenotype and reduces proliferation to <10% of normal, such that rescue of proliferation can be used as a simple readout for screening. Here, we describe the assay rationale and efforts toward validation of a microtiter plate-compatible assay and its application in a pilot screen of 3871 annotated compounds.

Our aim within the New Medicines for Trypanosomatidic Infections project was to use (1) synthetic and natural product libraries, (2) screening, and (3) a preclinical absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion-toxicity (ADME-Tox) profiling platform to identify compounds that can enter the trypanosomatidic drug discovery value chain. The synthetic compound libraries originated from multiple scaffolds with known antiparasitic activity and natural products from the Hypha Discovery MycoDiverse natural products library. Our focus was first to employ target-based screening to identify inhibitors of the protozoan Trypanosoma brucei pteridine reductase 1 ( TbPTR1) and second to use a Trypanosoma brucei phenotypic assay that made use of the T. brucei brucei parasite to identify compounds that inhibited cell growth and caused death. Some of the compounds underwent structure-activity relationship expansion and, when appropriate, were evaluated in a preclinical ADME-Tox assay panel. This preclinical platform has led to the identification of lead-like compounds as well as validated hits in the trypanosomatidic drug discovery value chain.","Chloro and bromo-pyrazole curcumin Knoevenagel condensates augmented anticancer activity against human cervical cancer cells: design, synthesis, in silico docking and in vitro cytotoxicity analysis.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784365,Journal of biomolecular structure & dynamics,2019 03 04,"With an endeavor to develop novel curcumin analogs as potential anti-cancer agents, we designed and synthesized a series of Knoevenagel condensates by clubbing pyrazole carbaldehydes at the active methylene carbon atom of the curcumin backbone.

The chloro derivative displayed five hydrogen bond interactions with a docking score of -11.874 kcal/mol higher than curcumin (docking score = -7.434 kcal/mol). This was supported by the fact that the propellant shaped derivatives fitted aptly into the binding pocket. Molecular simulations studies were also conducted on the lead molecule and the results figured out that the stable complexes were developed as the minimal deviations per residue of protein within the range of 0.11-0.92 Å. The screened compounds were synthesized, characterized and evaluated in vitro for cytotoxicity against cervical cancer cell line, HeLa using standard cell proliferation assay.

Subsequently, the results were compared with those of conventional culture identification using WIDER MIC/id system (Francisco Soria Melguizo SA, Spain). Considering the conventional approach as the gold standard, the proposed algorithm presented both a high specificity (98.1%) and a positive likelihood ratio of 37.42. The implementation of this algorithm would allow diagnosis of urinary tract infection in less than an hour in 92.4% of positive samples.

Any military member who comes forward to report their experience should be provided appropriate intervention, support, and restorative care. While much research has focused on prevention efforts and encouraging reporting, few researchers have systematically examined what happens when military members come forward. In the military, leaders (the chain of command) are primarily responsible for receiving and investigating reports of potential sex-based military equal opportunity violations (SBMEO) involving sexual harassment or gender discrimination. This study used results from the congressionally-mandated 2016 Workplace and Gender Relations Survey of Active Duty Members (2016 WGRA) to identify military members who indicated experiencing a potential SBMEO violation and reported to their chain of command (n = 3,982) in order to examine the relationships among the actions as a result of reporting, reporting satisfaction, emotional distress, and retention intentions. Findings revealed experiencing positive actions as a result of reporting was associated with increased satisfaction with reporting, which in turn, was associated with decreased emotional distress and increased retention intentions. Conversely, experiencing negative actions as a result of reporting was associated with decreased satisfaction with reporting, increased emotional distress, and decreased retention intentions. These findings highlight the crucial role military leaders serve in supporting those who come forward in mitigating potential negative outcomes associated with SBMEO violations that could impact military readiness."

Thus, this study aimed to investigate the expression and the functional role of klotho in DN progression in mice and in high glucose (HG)-induced cell injury of human renal glomerular endothelial cells (HRGECs) and the underlying mechanism. In this study, HRGECs were cultured with media containing HG to induce endothelial cell injury and db/db mice were used as DN model mice. Klotho was overexpressed or knocked down in HRECs to evaluate its role in HG-induced HRGECs injury. klotho-overexpressing adenovirus (rAAV-klotho) was injected into db/db mice via the tail vein to further validate the protective effect of klotho in DN. Decreased klotho expression was observed in DN patients, DN mice, and HG-exposed HRGECs. Furthermore, klotho overexpression significantly abolished the HG-induced HRGECs injury and activation of Wnt/β-catenin pathway and RAAS. In contrast, klotho knockdown exerted the opposite effects. Moreover, klotho attenuated diabetic nephropathy in db/db mice, which was also associated with inhibition of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway and RAAS.

Here, to elucidate the function of NF90 in the immune response, we analyzed systematically its influence on gene expression programs in the human monocytic cell line THP-1 expressing normal or reduced NF90 levels. RNA sequencing analysis revealed many mRNAs showing differential abundance in NF90-silenced cells, many of them encoding proteins implicated in the response to immune stimuli and malaria infection. The transcription of some of them (e.g. TNF, LILRB1, and CCL2 mRNAs) was modulated by silencing NF90. Ribonucleoprotein immunoprecipitation (RIP) analysis further revealed that a subset of these mRNAs associated directly with NF90. To understand how NF90 influenced globally the immune response to malaria infection, lysates of red blood cells infected with Plasmodium falciparum (iRBC lysates) or uninfected/mock-infected (uRBC lysates) were used to treat THP-1 cells as a surrogate of malaria infection. NF90 affected the stability of a few target mRNAs, but influenced more generally the translation and secretion of the encoded cytokines after treatment with either uRBC or iRBC lysates. Taken together, these results indicate that NF90 contributes to repressing the immune response in cells responding to P. falciparum infection and suggest that NF90 can be a therapeutic target in malaria.",Value-Based Pricing for Emerging Gene Therapies: The Economic Case for a Higher Cost-Effectiveness Threshold.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784347,Journal of managed care & specialty pharmacy,2019 02 20,"While one-time gene replacement therapies may offer transformative innovation for the management of ultrarare, health-catastrophic diseases, they also pose challenges to the current U.S. health care system. Historically, the United States and other countries have demonstrated a willingness to support higher prices for health gains in rare diseases. However, payers may be ill-prepared to address reimbursement based on single administrations associated with gene therapies. As yet, there is no consensus on how to appropriately reward gene therapy innovation. The purpose of this article is to characterize challenges for traditional approaches to assessing the value of one-time gene replacement therapies and to provide a health economic rationale for a higher value-based cost-effectiveness threshold (CET). There is a general recognition that ultrarare, health-catastrophic conditions should be judged against a higher CET. The Institute for Clinical and Economic Review in the United States has discussed a range of up to $500K per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained for ultrarare diseases, and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence in the United Kingdom has described a variable threshold up to £300,000 per QALY depending on the magnitude of the health gains. In practice, health technology assessment decision makers often make comparisons to ""benchmarks"" to justify both standard and extraordinary CETs. We briefly review and present a list of relevant benchmarks. We also sketch out how a broader concept of value could provide the basis for higher CETs for some ultrarare diseases. This approach is outlined by the recent International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research Special Task Force on Value Assessment Frameworks. In addition to the QALY gains, other elements of value related to uncertainty may also be important. They include insurance value, severity of disease, real option value, value of hope, and equity. A gene therapy currently in development for the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) provides an exemplar for discussing the issues that accompany one-time gene replacement therapies. It is imperative that we find a consensus on how to appropriately reward value created by these gene therapies to incentivize appropriate risk taking and investments by their developers-a higher CET would, by economic logic, support a higher value-based price. If consensus on appropriate rewards cannot be found for safe and effective gene therapies for diseases such as SMA with clear criticality and unmet need, it will be even more difficult to do so for diseases where the value provided is less apparent.

The disadvantages of tagitinin C which make its therapeutic application limited are low water solubility and poor stability. In this work, we encapsulated tagitinin C in the form of liposomal nanoparticles to overcome its limitations and evaluated its anticancer activity. Liposomes were prepared using phosphatidylcholine, tween 80 and with/without T. diversifolia pectin. Tagitinin C liposomes exhibited small sizes, a range of 252-311 nm, and negative surface charges. Liposomes coated by T. diversifolia pectin resulted in a slightly slower release rate than pectin-uncoated liposomes. The cytotoxicity of tagitinin C in pectin-coated liposomes was more pronounced than that in liposomes without pectin. Tagitinin C in liposomes showed significantly increased toxicity against human lung cancer cells LU-1 in comparison with DMSO-tagitinin C. Therefore, tagitinin C liposomes demonstrate significant potential as delivery systems for cancer therapy."

Recently, Graphene Nano ribbons (GNRs) has been a field of interest in biological methods and disease treatment such as drug delivery, DNA applications, and photothermal cancer therapies. GNRs demonstrate more efficient properties rather than other graphene-based Nanomaterials due to their larger surface area. These novel properties made them into a remarkable substitute material for biological fields as they have different cytotoxic effects and almost nontoxic to human health and the environment.

This study introduced whey protection capacity against chronic alcohol-induced liver injury. Rats were orally administered to 12% ethanol solution in water (ad libitum, average 8.14 g of ethanol/kg body weight (b.w.)/day) alone or combined with whey ( per os, 2 g/kg b.w./day). After 6-week treatment, chronic ethanol consumption induced significant histopathological liver changes: congestion, central vein dilation, hepatic portal vein branch dilation, Kupffer cells hyperplasia, fatty liver changes, and hepatocytes focal necrosis. Ethanol significantly increased liver catalase activity and glutathione reductase protein expression without significant effects on antioxidative enzymes: glutathione peroxidase (GPx), copper-zinc-containing superoxide dismutase (CuZnSOD) and manganese-containing superoxide dismutase (MnSOD). Co-treatment with whey significantly attenuated pathohistological changes induced by ethanol ingestion and increased GSH-Px and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) protein expression. Our results showed positive effects of whey on liver chronically exposed to ethanol, which seem to be associated with NF-κB-GPx signaling.",Early post-marketing experience with edaravone in an unselected group of patients with ALS.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784320,Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis & frontotemporal degeneration,2019 06 06,"Introduction: Treatment with edaravone has shown efficacy in a subgroup of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). However, it has been estimated that <7% of ALS patients fulfill the stringent inclusion criteria of the trial. In the current study, we aimed to explore retrospectively the efficacy of edaravone in unselected ALS patients. Methods: Demographic and clinical data were retrospectively collected for 22 patients who opted for treatment with edaravone and 71 untreated ALS patients attending the ALS clinic at Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center, Tel Aviv, Israel, between May 2017 and January 2018. Clinical data were extracted for a baseline visit at treatment onset, and for pre-baseline and post-baseline visits, roughly 6 months apart from the baseline visit. Results: Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics were similar between edaravone treated and untreated patients, except for shorter disease duration in edaravone treated patients. Muscle strength, ALS Functional rating scale (ALSFRS-R), and respiratory function were similar between edaravone treated and untreated patients, including monthly rate of decline before and after baseline visit. Among treated patients, 7 had major respiratory complications occurring between 8 days to 7 months after treatment initiation, during or within hours following infusions. Discussion: Results of our study comparing edaravone treated and untreated patients in a real-life setting showed no differences in the rate of monthly decline of ALSFRS-R, in line with previous reports in ALS patients not treated with edaravone, and a previous clinical trial. Our findings might suggest that edaravone is not effective in unselected ALS patients.",In vitro and in vivo characterization of pharmaceutical nanocarriers used for drug delivery.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784319,"Artificial cells, nanomedicine, and biotechnology",2019 02 20,"Nanotechnology has emerged strongly in most of the field of sciences at a tiny scale. At this size, atoms and molecules work differently and present a diversity of amazing and appealing applications. Pharmaceutical nanocarriers comprise nanoparticles, nanospheres, nanocapsules, nanoemulsion, nanoliposomes and nanoniosomes. The major objectives in designing nanocarriers are to manage particle size, surface properties as well as drug release in order to fulfil specific objectives. Hence, characterizations of nanocarriers are very critical to control their desired in vitro and in vivo behaviour. Nanocarriers are characterized by their size, morphology and surface charge, using highly advanced microscopic techniques as scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy. Surface morphology and size are measured by electron microscopy while dynamic light scattering and photon-correlation spectroscopy are used to determine the particle size and size distribution. Colloidal stability is ascertained through zeta potential which is an indirect measure of the surface charge and differential scanning calorimetry is used to characterize particles and drug interaction. Further, binding and internalization of targeted carriers to the specific cells could be determined by cell uptake study. Biodistribution study of targeted nanocarriers is carried out and intracellular uptake and subcellular localization of the nanocarrier could be confirmed using confocal microscopy. This review covers all the aforementioned aspect related to in vitro and in vivo characterization of pharmaceutical nanocarriers.",Clinical disease stage related changes of serological factors in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784318,Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis & frontotemporal degeneration,2019 05 13,Little is known whether disease clinical stage would influence the serological values in Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).

Alteration of intestinal integrity with subsequent translocation of bacterial products appears to play an important role; however, little is known about the impact of fungal translocation. We assessed the effect of fungal translocation and its association with immune activation in people living with HIV (PLWH) compared with uninfected controls. We measured serum levels of β-D-glucan (BDG) and anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies (ASCA) immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin A (IgA) and markers of systemic inflammation and immune activation in virally suppressed PLWH on antiretroviral therapy (ART) and uninfected controls. T-test and Mann-Whitney tests were used to compare markers by HIV status and correlation and regression analyses were used to assess associations of fungal translocation markers with markers of inflammation. One hundred seventy-six participants were included (128 HIV+ and 48 HIV-); 72% male, 65% African American, median age was 50 years, and CD4 was 710 cells/cm3. Levels of BDG tended to be lower in HIV+ when compared with controls (p = .05). No significant difference in levels of ASCA IgG and IgA was seen between groups (p > .75). There was a significant correlation between BDG and several markers of inflammation and immune activation in PLWH, not seen in uninfected controls. In contrast, no correlations were seen between levels of ASCA IgG and IgA with inflammatory markers. PLWH on ART do not have higher levels of BDG or ASCA when compared with uninfected controls, however, the association found between BDG and several inflammation markers suggests a potential role of fungal translocation in the heightened immune activation seen in treated HIV.",Determination of oil contents from eight varieties of olea europaea (Olive) grown in Pakistan.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784315,Natural product research,2019 02 20,"The olive (Olea europaea L.) is a worldwide famous tree crop having valuable commercial role due to nutritional as well as therapeutic benefits obtained from its edible oil.

The objective of this study was to reveal the role of chicken RB1 (Gallus gallus RB1, gRB1) in the proliferation of preadipocytes. 2. To measure gene expression of gRB1 in the proliferation of chicken preadipocyte, quantitative real-time PCR was used. The expression levels of gRB1 transiently increased during this process. 3. To detect the effect of gRB1 on the proliferation of chicken preadipocyte, MTT assay and cell-cycle analysis were performed. MTT assay showed that overexpression of gRB1 significantly suppressed (P < 0.05) the proliferation of chicken preadipocytes, and knockdown of gRB1 promoted the proliferation of chicken preadipocytes. Cell-cycle analysis showed that the proportion of preadipocytes in the G1 and G2 phases significantly increased (P < 0.05), and the proportion of preadipocytes in the S phase significantly decreased (P < .05) after up-regulation of the expression of gRB1. The proportion of preadipocytes in the S phase significantly increased (P < 0.05) after down-regulation of gRB1. 4. Quantitative real-time PCR was used to detect the effect of gRB1 on the expression of genes related to proliferation of chicken preadipocytes. Gene expression analysis showed that gRB1 knockdown promoted markers indicating proliferation of Ki-67 (MKi67) expression at 96 h (P < 0.05), and overexpression of gRB1 reduced MKi67 expression at 72 h (P < 0.05). 5. This study demonstrated that gRB1 inhibited preadipocyte proliferation at least in part by inhibiting the G1 to S phase transition.","Dendrobeaniamine A, a new alkaloid from the Arctic marine bryozoan Dendrobeania murrayana.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784299,Natural product research,2019 02 20,"The new guanidine alkaloid Dendrobeaniamine A (1) was isolated from the organic extract of the Arctic marine bryozoan Dendrobeania murrayana.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of different concentrations of ethyl esters added to forage on preference and short-term feed intake of goats. In the first of three trials, whole-crop maize silage was supplemented with different concentrations of EA and EL and then vacuum-stored before use. Forages sampled during the preference trial showed a good recovery of EL with a high accordance of target (naturally formed + supplemented) and analysed concentrations. Supplemented EA was not recovered, making transient storage of substrates before use in feeding trials equivocal. However, four treatments with different concentrations of EL (approximately 330, 560, 920 and 1300 mg/kg dry matter (DM)) were used for the preference trial. In Trials 2 and 3, EA and EL (with and without ethanol, respectively) were added to grass hay directly before offering the feed, each in concentrations of 0, 600 and 1200 mg/kg DM to have six treatments each. In all trials, each possible combination of treatments was offered to Saanen-type wethers (n = 10, Trial 1; n = 5, Trials 2 and 3) as free choice in preference trials. In Trial 1, there was only a weak impact of EL on preference behaviour as goats avoided medium EL concentrations, but did not avoid silages with higher concentrations. In Trials 2 and 3, there was no influence of added volatiles on short-term DM intake and preference at all. It can be concluded that it is unlikely that ethyl esters as single substance or in combination with ethanol affect preference behaviour and feed intake of ruminants. Possibly a combination or still unidentified fermentation products cause avoidance instead of a single compound.",Study on the psychological health and related risk factors in 245 patients with psoriasis in Inner Mongolia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784297,"Psychology, health & medicine",2019 06 05,"To investigate the psychological health and related risk factors in patients suffering from psoriasis. A total of 245 inpatients and outpatients with psoriasis were selected from January 2014 to December 2015. Patients with psoriasis were assessed a homemade questionnaire as well as the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI), Selfrating Anxiety Scale, Self-rating Depression Scale, Trait Coping Style Questionnaire and Social Avoidance and Distress Scale.Differences in sex, age, marital status, type of medical payment, occupation, economic situation, disease severity, and type of psychological state of psoriasis patients were significant, there was no significant difference in psychological health between psoriasis patients with different levels of educational attainment. Scores for anxiety, depression, social avoidance, and social distress were positively correlated with disease severity and negative-coping scores, but a significant negative correlation was observed with scores for social support and positive coping. Stepwise regression analysis of factors influencing psychological health showed that total social support and negative-coping scores could explain 65.2% of the variation. Patients with psoriasis can suffer from anxiety, depression, social distress, and social avoidance.

However, there has been a lack of consensus on video games efficacy and even limited understanding on the factors moderating its effectiveness. The present review sought to evaluate video game effects, relative to no-game control condition, on cognitive functions in older adults. The functions included processing speed, attention, delayed memory, reasoning, and executive functions (inhibition, shifting and updating memory). Personal and methodological moderators were explored to explain the variability in cognitive effects using meta-regression. Through a systematic literature search of online databases, 27 intervention studies were eligible, with a total of 1126 participants, for analysis. Using random-effect models, small but significant training effects were found on updating memory but none were detected in other cognitive functions. The heterogeneity across studies was in general high for all cognitive functions and was partially accounted for, in all cognitive functions except for inhibition and updating, by different moderators such as the proportion of females, outcome measure parameters, training intensity, and game type. The findings highlight limited effects of video games on cognitive functions that were largely influenced by factors related to study design.","Bioaccumulation and translocation of nine heavy metals by Eichhornia crassipes in Nile Delta, Egypt: perspectives for phytoremediation.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784295,International journal of phytoremediation,2019 06 10,"The current research was carried out to estimate the potential of water hyacinth (WH) for removal of nine heavy metals (HMs) from three irrigation canals in Nile Delta. Sampling was achieved in monospecific and homogeneous WH stands at three irrigation canals in the study area, and WH biomass was sampled at monthly intervals from April 2014 to November 2014 using five randomly distributed quadrats (each 0.5 × 0.5 m) at each canal. All HM concentrations were significantly higher in the roots compared with the other WH organs. The WH was recognized by a bioaccumulation factor >1.0 for all HMs. The WH was recognized by translocation factor <1.0 for all HMs (except Pb). In many cases, the concentrations of the HMs in the different organs of WH were correlated with the same HMs in the water. Such correlations indicate that WH reflects the cumulative influences of environmental pollution from the water, and thereby suggesting its potential use in the bio-monitoring of most examined HMs. In conclusion, WH is a promising macrophyte for remediation of irrigation canals polluted with Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, and Zn.",Cellular Compartmentation and the Redox/Nonredox Functions of NAD.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784294,Antioxidants & redox signaling,2019 04 23,"Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) spans diverse roles in biology, serving as both an important redox cofactor in metabolism and a substrate for signaling enzymes that regulate protein post-translational modifications (PTMs).",Treatment of Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) Background in Total Internal Reflection Ellipsometry: Characterization of RNA Polymerase II Film Formation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784293,Applied spectroscopy,2019 03 06,"To deal with the general problem of biomolecule specific binding analysis, we have applied the technique of difference spectra to the surface plasmon resonance (SPR)-enhanced total internal reflection ellipsometry measurement. We suggest a three-step treatment of the SPR background that can easily be integrated with the usual measurement routine. First, making use of the difference spectrum in ellipsometric angle Δ, single peak footprints of the topmost layer are obtained that facilitate its sensitive detection during film growth. Subsequently, circumventing the need for explicit knowledge of the substrate properties, the difference spectra peaks can be used for the end-point analysis of a binding. Finally, tracking the binding effectivity of the analyte we determine the injection speed and analyte concentration windows needed for successful monitoring of the film growth. We demonstrate our approach on a comprehensive two-stage binding experiment involving two biologically relevant molecules: the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II and CTD-interacting domain of one of its transcription factors, the Rtt103 protein.",Prognostic risk model construction and molecular marker identification in glioblastoma multiforme based on mRNA/microRNA/long non-coding RNA analysis using random survival forest method.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784292,Neoplasma,2019 05 31,"We aim to identify novel molecular signatures for prognosis prediction of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM).

Differentially expressed mRNAs, microRNAs (miRNAs) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) between GBM and normal samples were identified by differential expression analysis using Bayesian T-test. Functional enrichment analysis was performed to identify GBM associated functions and pathways. A subset of signature mRNAs was selected from differentially expressed mRNAs and used to build a risk model for GBM using random survival forest (RSF) method. The performance of the model in prognosis prediction was validated using an independent validation dataset. A competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network was then constructed and key prognostic markers were identified from the network by survival analysis. In total, 905 mRNAs, 24 miRNAs and 403 lncRNAs were identified to be differentially expressed between GBM and normal samples. Functional and pathway items such as p53 signaling and PI3K/Akt signaling were significantly enriched by differentially expressed mRNAs. The RSF risk model showed a high performance in prognosis prediction for both training and validation dataset. The ceRNA network provided a comprehensive view of the interplays between differentially expressed mRNAs, miRNAs and lncRNAs. Among the ceRNA network, p21 (RAC1) activated kinase 1 (PAK1) and synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2B (SV2B) were identified as key prognosis associated markers. The RSF risk model and key prognostic markers may contribute to GBM diagnosis in future clinical practice."

Although the intrinsic sensitivity of the first reported protocols was modest, we have now found that water spins in long-lived association at the nanoparticle monolayer constitute an alternative source of magnetization that can deliver a remarkable boost of sensitivity, especially when combined with saturation transfer experiments. The approach is general and can be applied to analyte-nanoreceptor systems of different compositions. In this work, we provide an account of the new method and we propose a generalized procedure based on a joint water-nanoparticle saturation to further upgrade the sensitivity, which ultimately endows selective analyte detection down to the micromolar range on standard instrumentation.","Factors Affecting Transfer of the Heavy Metals Arsenic, Lead, and Cadmium from Diatomaceous-Earth Filter Aids to Alcoholic Beverages during Laboratory-Scale Filtration.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784277,Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,2019 03 18,"Filtration methods for alcoholic fermented beverages often use filter aids such as diatomaceous earth (DE), which may contain elevated amounts of the heavy metals arsenic (As), lead (Pb), and cadmium (Cd). Here, we evaluated factors affecting transfer of these heavy metals from DE to beer and wine. A laboratory-scale filtration system was used to process unfiltered ale, lager, red wine, and white wine with three types of food-grade DE. Filtrate and DE were analyzed for heavy metals using ICP-MS, in addition to LC-ICP-MS for As-speciation analysis. Use of 2 g/L DE containing 5.4 mg/kg soluble inorganic As (iAs) for filtering beer and wine resulted in significant ( p < 0.05) increases of 11.2-13.7 μg/L iAs in the filtered beverage. There was a significant ( p < 0.05) effect from the DE quantity used in filtration on the transfer of iAs in all beverage types, whereas no alterations were observed for Pb and Cd levels. Methods to wash DE using water, citric acid, or EDTA all significantly ( p < 0.05) reduced iAs concentrations, whereas only EDTA significantly reduced Pb levels. Cd concentrations were not affected by any wash method. These data indicate that specific steps can be taken to limit heavy-metal transfer from DE filter aids to beer and wine.",Achieving Ultrahigh Capacity with Self-Assembled Ni(OH)2 Nanosheet-Decorated Hierarchical Flower-like MnCo2O4.5 Nanoneedles as Advanced Electrodes of Battery-Supercapacitor Hybrid Devices.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784276,ACS applied materials & interfaces,2019 03 18,"Self-assembled Ni(OH)2 nanosheet-decorated hierarchical flower-like MnCo2O4.5 nanoneedles were synthesized via a cost-effective and facile hydrothermal strategy, aiming to realize a high-capacity advanced electrode of a battery-supercapacitor hybrid (BSH) device. It is demonstrated that the as-synthesized hierarchical flower-like MnCo2O4.5@Ni(OH)2-nanosheet electrode exhibits a high specific capacity of 318 mAh g-1 at a current density of 3 A g-1 and still maintains a capacity of 263.5 mAh g-1 at a higher current density of 20 A g-1, with an extremely long cycle lifespan of 87.7% capacity retention after 5000 cycles. Moreover, using the unique core-shell structure as the cathode and hollow Fe2O3 nanoparticles/reduced graphene oxide as the anode, the BSH device delivers a high energy density of 56.53 Wh kg-1 when the power density reaches 1.9 kW kg-1, and there is an extraordinarily good cycling stability with the capacity retention rate of 90.4% after 3000 cycles. It is believed that the superior properties originate from desirable core-shell structures alleviating the impact of volume changes as well as the existence of two-dimensional Ni(OH)2 nanosheets with more active sites, thereby improving the cycle stability and achieving ultrahigh capacity. These results will provide more access to the rational material design of diverse nanostructures toward high-performance energy storage devices.",Topotactic Ion Exchange in a Three-Dimensional Close-Packed Trirutile Structure with an Octahedral Network.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784275,Inorganic chemistry,2019 03 08,"Topotactic ion exchange in open-framework solids and oxides with layered and tunnel structures has resulted in the formation of a variety of metastable functional materials that are inaccessible otherwise. These ion exchanges are primarily limited to the above structure types because of the presence of labile ions as loosely held charge-compensating cations/anions as in the framework or tunnel structures or the lability of the ions/charged motifs in interlayer galleries of layered oxides. While such topotactic exchanges are common in the above structure types, they are rare in the three-dimensional (3D) close-packed structures based solely on corner- and/or edge-connected polyhedral networks. Herein, we demonstrate divalent iron exchange in a close-packed all-octahedral-coordinated trirutile oxide. This has enabled the transformation of a near-ultraviolet-absorbing diamagnetic insulating oxide into a visible-light-active paramagnetic semiconductor. An ion exchange of this kind may open up avenues for the development of metastable functional oxides with a variety of other 3D structures and diverse properties.",Mass Spectrometric Imaging Reveals Temporal and Spatial Dynamics of Bioactive Lipids in Arteries Undergoing Restenosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784274,Journal of proteome research,2019 05 01,"Restenosis, or renarrowing of the arterial lumen, is a common recurrent disease following balloon angioplasty and stenting treatments for cardiovascular disease. A major technical barrier for deciphering restenotic mechanisms is the dynamic, spatial profiling of bioactive lipids in the arterial wall, especially in small animals. Here, applying matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometric imaging (MALDI-MSI), we conducted the first lipidomic study of temporal-spatial profiling in a small animal model of angioplasty-induced restenosis. Cross sections were collected 3, 7, and 14 days after balloon angioplasty of rat carotid arteries. MALDI-MSI analyses showed that diacylglycerols (DAGs), signaling lipids associated with restenosis, and lysophosphatidylcholines (LysoPCs), whose function was uncharacterized in restenosis, dramatically increased at postangioplasty day 7 and day 14 in the neointimal layer of balloon-injured arteries compared to uninjured controls. In contrast, sphingomyelins (SMs) did not increase, but rather decreased at day 3, day 7, and day 14 in injured arteries versus the uninjured control arteries. These results revealed previously unexplored distinct temporal-spatial lipid dynamics in the restenotic arterial wall. Additionally, we employed time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) tandem MS imaging for both molecular identification and imaging at high spatial resolution. These imaging modalities provide powerful tools for unraveling novel mechanisms of restenosis involving lipids or small signaling molecules.",Binding of Plant Polyphenols to Serum Albumin and LDL: Healthy Implications for Heart Disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784273,Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,2019 06 11,"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in industrialized nations. The initiating event in atherosclerosis, or hardening of the arteries, is oxidation of low density lipoprotein (LDL). Binding with serum albumin and LDL of 41 polyphenols (major antioxidants in plant foods) constituting four classes of flavonoids, three types of phenolic acids, and seven polyphenol conjugate metabolites was investigated indirectly by fluorescence quenching and directly by affinity separation/high-performance liquid chromatography (four of the polyphenols). Stern-Volmer plots yielded K values for the two proteins. Polyphenol binding was significantly stronger for albumin than with LDL.  K values were highly correlated with the lipophilicity of the polyphenols. The number of polyphenol molecules determined by quenching was ∼1 for both proteins. Direct analysis under saturation conditions yielded from 2 to 13 molecules of polyphenols/LDL particle. Multiple substituent effects on binding were analyzed. Evidence was put forward that binding of polyphenols to these proteins is protective for CVD by multiple mechanisms.",Amount of Collagen in the Meat Contained in Japanese Daily Dishes and the Collagen Peptide Content in Human Blood after Ingestion of Cooked Fish Meat.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784272,Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,2019 03 22,"Objectives of the present study were to evaluate amounts of collagen in Japanese daily dishes and contents of food-derived collagen peptides in human blood. The meat in one serving of most Japanese daily dishes contains 0.2-2.5 g of collagen, except for beef tendon, eel with skin, and skinned shark tail (7.6-13.3 g). After ingestion of cooked shark meat, nine collagen di- and tripeptides were detected in plasma and the area under the curve of most peptides, except for Hyp-Gly and Pro-Hyp-Gly, was ∼30% of that after ingestion of collagen hydrolysate containing an equivalent amount of collagen. Likewise, only ∼30% of the total collagen in the meat was liberated into solution by pepsin and pancreatin digestion. Thus, ingestion of collagen-rich meat increases the collagen peptides in blood, which depends on not only the collagen content in the meat but also the susceptibility of the collagen/gelatin to digestive endoproteinases.",Pre-fractionation Extends but also Creates a Bias in the Detectable HLA Class Ι Ligandome.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784271,Journal of proteome research,2019 04 12,"HLA class Ι molecules can communicate a range of cellular alterations (mutations, changes in protein copy number, aberrant post-translational modifications, or pathogen proteins) to CD8+ T lymphocytes in the form of HLA peptide ligands. At any given moment, tens of thousands of different self and foreign HLA class Ι peptides may be presented on the cell surface by HLA class Ι complexes. Due to the enormous biochemical diversity and low abundance of each of these peptides, HLA ligandome analysis presents unique challenges. Even with advances in enrichment strategies and MS instrumentation and fragmentation, sufficient ligandome depth for identification of viral pathogens and immuno therapeutically important tumor neo-antigens is still not routinely achievable. In this study, we evaluated two pre-fractionation techniques, high-pH reversed-phase and strong cation exchange, for the complementary analyses of HLA class Ι peptide ligands. We observe that pre-fractionation substantially extends the detectable HLA class Ι ligandome but also creates an identification bias. We thus advocate a rational choice between high-pH reversed-phase or strong cation exchange pre-fractionation for deeper HLA class Ι ligandome analysis, depending on the HLA locus, allele, or peptide ligand modification in question.",[Ag-Ag]2+ Unit-Encapsulated Trimetallic Cages: One-Pot Syntheses and Modulation of Argentophilic Interactions by the Uncoordinated Substituents.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784270,Inorganic chemistry,2019 03 08,"Four [Ag-Ag]2+ unit-encapsulated trimetallic cages 1-4 were synthesized from one new tripodal ligand L and silver salts in different solvent systems by a one-pot method. The formation of coordination cages occurred simultaneously with the condensation of amino groups and ketone. The remarkable structural feature of cages 1-4 is their spontaneous incorporation of [Ag-Ag]2+ cationic units. Moreover, the argentophilic interactions are modulated by the uncoordinated amino substituents. The study herein shows that modification and subtle changes of the cage structures could be realized by a one-pot synthetic method.",Image-Based Investigation: Biorelevant Solubility of α and γ Indomethacin.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784269,Analytical chemistry,2019 03 19,"Solubility is a physicochemical property highly dependent on the solid-state form of a compound. Thus, alteration of a compound's solid-state form can be undertaken to enhance the solubility of poorly soluble drug compounds. In the Biopharmaceutics Classification System (BCS), drugs are classified on the basis of their aqueous solubility and permeability. However, aqueous solubility does not always correlate best with in vivo solubility and consequently bioavailability. Therefore, the use of biorelevant media is a more suitable approach for mimicking in vivo conditions. Here, assessed with a novel image-based single-particle-analysis (SPA) method, we report a constant ratio of solubility increase of 3.3 ± 0.5 between the α and γ solid-state forms of indomethacin in biorelevant media. The ratio was independent of pH, ionic strength, and surfactant concentration, which all change as the drug passes through the gastrointestinal tract. On the basis of the solubility ratio, a free-energy difference between the two polymorphic forms of 2.9 kJ/mol was estimated. Lastly, the use of the SPA approach to assess solubility has proven to be simple, fast, and both solvent- and sample-sparing, making it an attractive tool for drug development."

Multiplexing using engineered solutions such as microarrays, synthetic nanopores, and DNA barcodes is promising, but they require sophisticated design/engineering and typically yield semiquantitative information. Single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) is an attractive tool in this regard as it enables both sensitive and quantitative detection. However, multiplexing with smFRET remains a great challenge as it requires either multiple excitation sources, an antenna system created by multiple FRET pairs, or multiple acceptors of the donor fluorophore, which complicates not only the labeling schemes but also data analysis, due to overlapping of FRET efficiencies ( EFRET). Here, we address these currently outstanding issues by designing interconvertible hairpin-based sensors (iHabSs) with nonoverlapping EFRET utilizing a single donor/acceptor pair and demonstrate a high-confidence multiplex detection of unlabeled nucleic acid sequences. We validated the reliability of our approach by systematically omitting one target at a time. Further, we demonstrate that these iHabSs are fully recyclable, sensitive with a limit of detection of ∼200 pM, and able to discriminate against single base mismatches. The multiplexed approach developed here has the potential to benefit the fields of biosensing and diagnostics by allowing simultaneous and quantitative detection of unlabeled nucleic acid biomarkers.","In Vivo Imaging of Endogenously Produced HClO in Zebrafish and Mice Using a Bright, Photostable Ratiometric Fluorescent Probe.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784257,Analytical chemistry,2019 03 19,"A high brightness red fluorescent probe (S-BODIPY) has been developed for the sensitive and specific imaging of HClO/ClO- in vitro and in vivo. This probe exhibits some distinctive features such as excellent resistance to photobleaching, a high fluorescence brightness, high selectivity, as well as a good biocompatibility. Upon oxidation of the thio-ether group into sulfoxide, the probe showed a noticeable ratiometric fluorescence response toward ClO- with fast response (within 30 s) and a low detection limit (59 nM). The probe demonstrated the successful imaging of exogenous and endogenous HClO/ClO- in living HeLa cells, zebrafish, and mice with high signal-to-noise ratios. S-BODIPY allows for the real-time monitoring the level of ClO- in living cells by ratiometric fluorescence imaging, opening up exciting prospects to develop red and even near-infrared BODIPYs with high brightness and good photostability for in vivo imaging.",Colorimetric and Fluorescent Dual-Mode Immunoassay Based on Plasmon-Enhanced Fluorescence of Polymer Dots for Detection of PSA in Whole Blood.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784256,ACS applied materials & interfaces,2019 03 13,"Although enormous efforts have been devoted to the development of new types of fluorometric immunochromatographic test strip (ICTS) with improved sensitivity over the past years, it still remains a big challenge to design ICTS with colorimetric and fluorescent bimodal signal readout for rapid yet accurate detection of cancer markers in a clinic. Scientists have tried to prepare bimodal reporters by combining fluorescent dyes with metal nanomaterials, but their fluorescence was easily quenched by metal nanomaterials through surface energy transfer, making dual colorimetric and fluorometric ICTS very difficult to be achieved. As compared to conventional fluorescent probes, semiconducting polymer dots (Pdots) exhibit extraordinary fluorescence brightness and facile surface functionalization, which are very suitable to be engineered as bimodal signal reporting reagents. Here, we integrated highly fluorescent Pdots with strongly plasmonic Au nanorods to form Pdot-Au hybrid nanocomposites with dual colorimetric and fluorescent readout abilities. We further utilized these nanohybrids in ICTS for qualitatively fast screening (colorimetry) as well as quantitatively accurate determination (fluorometry) of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) within 10 min. By taking advantage of the plasmon-enhanced fluorescence of Pdots on Au nanorods, this immunoassay possesses much better detection sensitivity of 1.07 pg/mL for PSA, which is at least 2 orders of magnitude lower than that of conventional fluorometric ICTS. Moreover, the direct detection of PSA from human whole blood collected without sample pretreatment makes this Pdot-based ICTS platform promising for on-site point-of-care diagnostics.",Older age and HDL-cholesterol as independent predictors of liver fibrosis assessed by BARD score.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784251,Minerva medica,2019 05 01,"It is known that non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and in particular non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, can progress to advanced fibrosis.

Although most agree that T1DM-induced hyperglycemia is a risk factor for progressive bone loss, the mechanisms for the link between T1DM and bone loss still remain elusive. In this study, we found that bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) isolated from T1DM donors were less inducible for osteogenesis than those from non-T1DM donors and further identified a mechanism involving bone morphogenetic protein-6 (BMP6) that was produced significantly less in BMSCs derived from T1DM donors than that in control cells. With addition of exogenous BMP6 in culture, osteogenesis of BMSCs from T1DM donors was restored whereas the treatment of BMP6 seemed not to affect non-T1DM control cells. We also demonstrated that bone mineral density (BMD) was reduced in streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice compared with that in control animals, and intraperitoneal injection of BMP6 mitigated bone loss and increased BMD in diabetic mice. Our results suggest that bone formation in T1DM patients is impaired by reduction of endogenous BMP6, and supplementation of BMP6 enhances osteogenesis of BMSCs to restore BMD in a mouse model of T1DM, which provides insight into the development of clinical treatments for T1DM-assocaited bone loss.

However, the prevalence and rates of injuries from NFS are unknown, as few victims present to medical attention after strangulation. As up to 40% of fatal strangulations have no external signs, and the majority of surviving victims have few or minor injuries, finding those people severely injured remains challenging. The majority of the evidence regarding NFS is largely based on case reports and case series with no robust studies estimating rates of injuries or the best investigation tools. The injuries that are reported make clear that strangulation is a potentially lethal form of injury that should not be ignored in those presenting having been strangled, or in those presenting with neurological symptoms, including strokes, seizures and vascular abnormalities. The safety implications of strangulation are also important as it can be a prelude to homicide.

In this study, the prevalence of HEV among Swedish pigs was investigated by HEV RNA analysis in 363 faecal samples from 3-month-old piglets sampled twice (2013 and 2014) in 30 Swedish pig farms. Four different types of farms were investigated; organic, conventional closed (keeping the sow), satellites in a sow pool (conventional farms sharing sows) and conventional non-closed farms (purchasing gilts). More than two-thirds (77%) of the farms had HEV-infected pigs. HEV RNA was found in faeces from 79 pigs (22%). Partial ORF1 could be sequenced in 46 strains. Phylogenetic analysis revealed a unique HEV3 strain for each farm. Strains sampled more than a year apart from the same farm were closely related, indicating that the same HEV strain is present for several years on the farm. Despite that only 4% of the Swedish pig farms were investigated, two farms had strains similar to those from humans, another had strains similar to wild boar HEV. The uniqueness of strains from each farm indicates a possibility to identify a source of infection down to farm level. This knowledge may be used by the farms to investigate the effectiveness of good hygiene routines to reduce the amount of HEV and thus the infection risk in the farm, and for Swedish public health authorities to identify cases of HEV transmissions from consumption of uncooked pork.","Outbreak of swimmer's itch in Central Italy: Description, causative agent and preventive measures.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784198,Zoonoses and public health,2019 06 07,"Swimmer's itch is caused by the penetration of free-swimming larvae of trematodes of the family Schistosomatidae in human skin. It is usually reported in people engaged in recreational water activities in freshwater bodies and in most of cases, it is provoked by bird schistosomes of the genus Trichobilharzia. In the summer 2017, many cases of dermatitis were recorded in people bathing in the waters of the Albano Lake (Rome, Italy) and a parasitological investigation was carried out in order to ascertain the causative agent of these cases. Snails of the family Lymnaeidae, natural intermediate hosts of bird schistosomes, were collected from lake shallow waters to detect the presence of trematodes of the genus Trichobilharzia. Pools of maximum 10 snails were placed in Petri dishes, and cercarial emergence was stimulated exposing snails to strong artificial light intensity at 25°C. Three hundred and thirty-seven snails were collected and screened for the shedding of cercariae. Furcocercariae of the family Schistosomatidae, with a morphology overlapping that of the genus Trichobilharzia, were detected in seven Petri dishes. Assuming that in each positive Petri dish just one snail was shedding furcocercariae, the minimum infectious rate was 2.1%. Molecular analysis of furcocercariae allowed ascribing them to the species Trichobilharzia franki. Snails of the species Radix auricularia were identified as intermediate hosts of the parasite. This is the second record of T. franki causing cercarial dermatitis in Central Italy, the third in Italy. The 2017 was in Italy exceptionally warm and dry. Trematodes are sensitive to changes in temperature, being cercarial production and emission rates temperature dependent. Small increases in water temperature would speed up parasite development and transmission, leading to a manifold increase in cercarial emergence. Moreover, high temperatures raise chances to acquire the infection, due to increased time spent in water by people.",The mechanism of TDP-43 gene expression on inflammatory factors and the JNK and p38 MAPK signalling pathways in ischaemic hypoxic stress dependence.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784197,International wound journal,2019 05 24,"In this study, the mechanism of TDP-43 gene expression on inflammatory factors and Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling pathways in ischaemic hypoxic stress dependence was investigated. Sixty SD rats were selected and divided into the control group, the osteoarthritis (OA) model group, and the TDP-43-mMSCs+OA group. In the OA model group and the TDP-43-mMSCs+OA group, OA was established by collagenase injection. Western blotting assays were used to detect the expression of TDP-43 in cartilage tissues of each rat. The secretion of tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) in the serum of rats was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The formation of cytoplasmic stress granules (SGs) and the expression of receptor for activated c-kinase 1 (RACK1) were detected by Western blotting assays in each group of rats. The expression of MTK1 and MAPKKK phosphorylation and changes in the JNK and p38 MAPK signalling pathways were detected by Western blotting assays. Compared with the control group, the expression of TDP-43 in the cartilage tissue of rats in the OA model group was significantly decreased. The expression of TDP-43 in the cartilage tissue of rats in the TDP-43-mMSCs+OA group was significantly higher than that of the control group and the OA model group, which indicates that TDP-43-mMSC transplantation was successful. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay results showed that the plasma TNF-α and IL-1β levels in the OA model group were significantly increased (P < 0.01) when compared with the control group. However, the secretion of TNF-α and IL-1β in the serum of the TDP-43-mMSCs+OA group was significantly lower than that of the model group (P < 0.01) but still higher than the control group. This indicates that overexpression of TDP-43 reduces the inflammatory response induced by OA. Western blotting assays showed that the amount of cytoplasmic SGs in the cartilage tissue of rats in the OA model group was significantly decreased when compared with the control group. The amount of SGs in the cartilage of rats in the TDP-43-mMSCs+OA group was significantly higher than that of the model group. The expression of RACK1 in the cartilage tissue of rats in the OA model group was significantly higher than that of the control group. Overexpression of the TDP-43 gene can interfere with the secretion of inflammatory factors and inhibit the activation of the JNK and p38 MAPK signalling pathways by ischaemic hypoxia stress. Thus, the molecular mechanism of chondrocytopathic lesions was reversed, which provided a new theoretical basis for the treatment of OA.",Discovery and structural analysis of a phloretin hydrolase from the opportunistic human pathogen Mycobacterium abscessus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784195,The FEBS journal,2019 05 20,"The family of PhlG proteins catalyses the hydrolysis of carbon-carbon bonds and is widely distributed across diverse bacterial species. Two members of the PhlG family have been separately identified as 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol (2,4-DAPG) hydrolase and phloretin hydrolase; however, the extent of functional divergence and catalytic substrates for most members of this family is still unknown. Here, using sequence similarity network and gene co-occurrence analysis, we categorized PhlG proteins into several subgroups and inferred that PhlG proteins from Mycobacterium abscessus (MaPhlG) are likely to be functionally equivalent to phloretin hydrolase. Indeed, we confirmed the hydrolytic activity of MaPhlG towards phloretin and its analog monoacetylphloroglucinol (MAPG), and the crystal structure of MaPhlG in complex with MAPG revealed the key residues involved in catalysis and substrate binding. Through mutagenesis and enzymatic assays, we demonstrated that H160, I162, A213 and Q266, which are substituted in 2,4-DAPG hydrolase, are essential for the activity towards phloretin. Based on the conservation of these residues, potential phloretin hydrolases were identified from Frankia, Colletotrichum tofieldiae and Magnaporthe grisea, which are rhizosphere inhabitants. These enzymes may be important for rhizosphere adaptation of the producing microbes by providing a carbon source through anaerobic degradation of flavonoids.

Gene editing offers new opportunities to transfer genetic resistance to crops that seem to lack natural eIF4E alleles. However, because eIF4E are physiologically important proteins, any introduced modification for virus resistance must not bring adverse phenotype effects. In this study, we assessed the role of amino acid substitutions encoded by a Pisum sativum eIF4E virus-resistance allele (W69L, T80D S81D, S84A, G114R and N176K) by introducing them independently into the Arabidopsis thaliana eIF4E1 gene, a susceptibility factor to the Clover yellow vein virus (ClYVV). Results show that most mutations were sufficient to prevent ClYVV accumulation in plants without affecting plant growth. In addition, two of these engineered resistance alleles can be combined with a loss-of-function eIFiso4E to expand the resistance spectrum to other potyviruses. Finally, we use CRISPR-nCas9-cytidine deaminase technology to convert the Arabidopsis eIF4E1 susceptibility allele into a resistance allele by introducing the N176K mutation with a single-point mutation through C-to-G base editing to generate resistant plants. This study shows how combining knowledge on pathogen susceptibility factors with precise genome-editing technologies offers a feasible solution for engineering transgene-free genetic resistance in plants, even across species barriers.",Notch1 activates angiogenic regulator Netrin4 in endothelial cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784178,Journal of cellular and molecular medicine,2019 05 03,"Netrin4 (NTN4) is a chemotropic factor that regulates angiogenesis.

Notch1 activation also increased NTN4 secretion from HUVECs. We subsequently demonstrated that NICD1 bound to CSL (CBF1, Suppressor of Hairless, Lag-1), a core component of Notch transcription complex, at the -53 element of the human NTN4 gene promoter. Loss of the -53 element compromised NICD1-induced NTN4 expression.

Apart from neutrophils, macrophages and lymphocytes, the role of dendritic cells (DCs) in IRI has been noticed. The study was aimed at investigating whether the high-mobility group protein box-1/toll like receptor 4 (HMGB1/TLR4) signalling pathway regulate the migration, adhesion and aggregation of DCs to the myocardium, induce DCs activation and maturation, stimulate the expression of surface costimulatory molecules and participate in myocardial IRI. In vivo, migration, adhesion, and aggregation of DCs was enhanced; the expression of peripheral blood DCs CD80 and CD86, myocardial adhesion molecules were increased; and the infarct size was increased during myocardial ischaemia reperfusion injury myocardial ischemic/reperfusion injury (MI/RI). These responses induced by MI/RI were significantly inhibited by HMGB1 specific neutralizing antibody treatment. Cellular experiments confirmed that HMGB1 promoted the release of inflammatory cytokines through TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB, upregulated CD80 and CD86 expression, mediated the damage of cardiomyocytes and accelerated the apoptosis. Our results indicate that DCs activation and maturation, stimulate the expression of surface costimulatory molecules by promoting the release of inflammatory factors through NF-κB pathway and participate in myocardial IRI.",Platelets retain inducible alpha granule secretion by P-selectin expression but exhibit mechanical dysfunction during trauma-induced coagulopathy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784176,Journal of thrombosis and haemostasis : JTH,2019 05 03,"Essentials Platelets in trauma-induced coagulopathy (TIC) are impaired, but the mechanism is not known. We performed comprehensive longitudinal platelet function testing in trauma patient samples. Platelets in TIC are widely impaired early after injury, but platelet activatability is intact. This suggests a mechanism of transient platelet cytoskeletal/integrin dysfunction during TIC. SUMMARY: Background Trauma-induced coagulopathy (TIC) is a common and deadly bleeding disorder. Platelet dysfunction is present during TIC, but its mechanisms remain unclear. Platelets are currently thought to become ""exhausted,"" a state in which they have released their granule contents and can no longer aggregate or contract. Methods This prospective observational cohort study tested the hypothesis that platelet exhaustion is present during TIC and characterized the early time course of platelet dysfunction. Blood was collected from 95 adult trauma patients at a Level I trauma center at time of Emergency Department arrival and several time points over 72 h. Platelet activation state and function were characterized using CD62P (P-selectin) and PAC-1 surface membrane staining, platelet function analyzer (PFA-100), aggregometry, viscoelastic platelet mapping, and, to test for exhaustion, their ability to express CD62P after ex vivo adenosine diphosphate (ADP) agonism. Platelet function was compared between patients with and without TIC, defined by prothrombin time ≥18 s. Results Platelets in TIC showed no initial increase in their level of surface activation markers or impairment of their capacity to express CD62P in response to ADP stimulation. However, TIC platelets were impaired in nearly all functional assays, spanning adhesion, aggregation, and contraction. These effects largely remained after controlling for platelet count and fibrinogen concentration and resolved after 8 h. Conclusion The TIC platelets exhibit early impairment of adhesion, aggregation, and contraction with retained alpha granule secretion ability, suggesting a specific mechanism of cytoskeletal or integrin dysfunction that is not a result of more general platelet exhaustion.",Role of glucocorticoids on noradrenergic and dopaminergic neurotransmission within the basolateral amygdala and dentate gyrus during morphine withdrawal place aversion.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784175,Addiction biology,2019 02 20,"Aversive memories related to drug withdrawal can generate a motivational state leading to compulsive drug taking. However, the mechanisms underlying the generation of these withdrawal memories remain unclear. Limbic structures, such as the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus, play a crucial role in the negative affective component of morphine withdrawal. Given the prominent role of glucocorticoids (GCs), noradrenaline (NA), and dopamine (DA) in memory-related processes, in the present study, we employed the conditioned place aversion (CPA) paradigm to uncover the role of GCs on NA and DA neurotransmission within the BLA and NA neurotransmission within the DG during opiate-withdrawal conditioning (memory formation consolidation), and after reexposure to the conditioned environment (memory retrieval). We observed that adrenalectomy impaired naloxone-induced CPA. Memory retrieval was associated with an increase in dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) levels in the BLA in morphine-addicted animals in a GC-independent manner. Importantly, NA turnover was related with the expression of withdrawal physical signs during the conditioning phase and with locomotor activity during the test phase. On the other hand, reduced DA concentration in the BLA was correlated with the CPA score. Our results indicate that while noradrenergic system is more associated with the somatic consequences of withdrawal, dopaminergic neurotransmission modulates the affective state. Nevertheless, it seems necessary that both systems work together with GCs to enable aversive-memory formation and recall.",A Dual-Purpose Bromocoumarin Tag Enables Deep Profiling of the Cellular Cysteinome.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784174,Proteomics,2019 05 31,"Chemical proteomics enables comprehensive profiling of small molecules in complex proteomes. A critical component to understand the interactome of a small molecule is the precise location on a protein where the interaction takes place. Several approaches have been developed that take advantage of bio-orthogonal chemistry and subsequent enrichment steps to isolate peptides modified by small molecules. These methods rely on target identification at the level of mass spectrometry making it difficult to interpret an experiment when modified peptides are not identified. Herein, an approach in which fluorescence-triggered two-dimensional chromatography enables the isolation of small molecule-conjugated peptides prior to mass spectrometry analysis is described. In this study, a bromocoumarin moiety has been utilized that fluoresces and generates a distinct isotopic signature to locate and identify modified peptides. Profiling of a cellular cysteinome with the use of a bromocoumarin tag demonstrates that two-dimensional fluorescence-based chromatography separation can enable the identification of proteins containing reactive cysteine residues. Moreover, the method facilitates the interrogation of low abundance proteins with greater depth and sensitivity than a previously reported isotope-targeted approach. Lastly, this workflow enables the identification of small-molecule modified peptides from a protein-of-interest.",Inhibition of the amino-acid transporter LAT1 demonstrates anti-neoplastic activity in medulloblastoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784173,Journal of cellular and molecular medicine,2019 04 09,"Most cases of medulloblastoma (MB) occur in young children. While the overall survival rate can be relatively high, current treatments combining surgery, chemo- and radiotherapy are very destructive for patient development and quality of life. Moreover, aggressive forms and recurrences of MB cannot be controlled by classical therapies. Therefore, new therapeutic approaches yielding good efficacy and low toxicity for healthy tissues are required to improve patient outcome. Cancer cells sustain their proliferation by optimizing their nutrient uptake capacities. The L-type amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1) is an essential amino acid carrier overexpressed in aggressive human cancers that was described as a potential therapeutic target. In this study, we investigated the therapeutic potential of JPH203, a LAT1-specific pharmacological inhibitor, on two independent MB cell lines belonging to subgroups 3 (HD-MB03) and Shh (DAOY). We show that while displaying low toxicity towards normal cerebral cells, JPH203 disrupts AA homeostasis, mTORC1 activity, proliferation and survival in MB cells. Moreover, we demonstrate that a long-term treatment with JPH203 does not lead to resistance in MB cells. Therefore, this study suggests that targeting LAT1 with JPH203 is a promising therapeutic approach for MB treatment.",Factor XI and recurrent venous thrombosis: an observational cohort study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784172,Journal of thrombosis and haemostasis : JTH,2019 05 01,"Essentials Factor XI is a potential target for anticoagulation. The association between factor XI and venous thrombosis recurrence was tested in a cohort study. Low factor XI was associated with reduced risk of recurrent venous thrombosis. A sex-and age-adjusted linear association between D-Dimer and factor XI was found. SUMMARY: Background and objectives Low factor XI activity (FXIa) reduces the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE), and FXI is regarded as a potential target for anticoagulation. Patients/methods We studied the relationship between FXIa and VTE in 851 patients with unprovoked VTE in whom anticoagulation had been stopped. Results Recurrent VTE was recorded in 265 patients. The sex-adjusted and age-adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of recurrence was 0.94 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.89-0.99) for each decrease of 10 IU dL-1 in FXIa. The HRs of recurrence were 0.73 (95% CI 0.54-0.99) for patients with FXIa below the 34th percentile, and 1.05 (95% CI 0.79-1.39) for patients with FXIa between the 34th and 67th percentiles, as compared with patients with higher FXIa. The probability of recurrence was lower among patients with FXIa below the 34th percentile than in patients with higher FXIa (P = 0.029). At 10 years, the probabilities of recurrence were 31%, 43% and 41% among patients with FXIa below the 34th percentile, with FXIa between the 34th and 67th percentiles, or with higher FXIa, respectively. We found a significant sex-adjusted and age-adjusted linear association between D-dimer levels, measured 3 weeks after anticoagulation, and FXIa. When patients' age and sex are taken into account, a patient with 10 IU dL-1 lower FXIa is expected to have a 2.79% (95% CI 0.95-4.59%) lower D-dimer value (P = 0.003). Conclusions Our findings of a lower thrombosis risk and less pronounced hemostatic system activation among patients with low FXIa is in line with the concept that FXI is a promising target for anticoagulation.",Simple fabrication of inner chitosan-coated alginate hollow microfiber with higher stability.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784171,"Journal of biomedical materials research. Part B, Applied biomaterials",2019 02 20,"Sodium alginate (NaA) has been widely used as microfiber-based scaffold material. However, Ca-alginate microfiber might disintegrate in the physiological environment due to the loss of calcium ions, which will limit its long-term application in tissue engineering. In this work, to enhance the stability of Ca-alginate microfiber in the physiological environment, an inner chitosan coating was introduced to Ca-alginate hollow microfiber by one step via a microfluidic device. A more stable composite microfiber with double cross-linking layers was generated. The stability of the microfiber was studied in the PBS solution (pH 7.4) to identify the coating effect on the hollow structure. The results revealed that chitosan component bonded an NaA layer to form a stable polyelectrolyte complex membrane in the inner wall of the microfiber, which stabilized the hollow region even though the Ca-alginate shell was disintegrated by PBS solution. In addition, the introduction of chitosan coating improved the inner environment of the low affinity of alginate to cell surfaces and facilitated the cell adhesion and culture in the microfiber.

Among all the amyloidogenic peptides identified in human semen, PAP248-286 was found to be the most active and was termed as semen-derived enhancer of viral infection (SEVI). Although amyloidogenic nature of the peptide is mainly linked with enhancement of the viral infection, the most active physiological conformation of the aggregated peptide remains inconclusive. Lipids are known to modulate aggregation pathway of a variety of proteins and peptides and constitute one of the most abundant biomolecules in human semen. PAP248-286 significantly differs from the other known amyloidogenic peptides, including Aβ and IAPP, in terms of critical concentration, surface charge, fibril morphology, and structural transition during aggregation. Hence, in the present study, we aimed to assess the effect of a lipid, 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC), on PAP248-286 aggregation and the consequent conformational outcomes. Our initial observation suggested that the presence of the lipid considerably influenced the aggregation of PAP248-286 . Further, ZDOCK and MD simulation studies of peptide multimerization have suggested that the hydrophobic residues at C-terminus are crucial for PAP248-286 aggregation and are anticipated to be major DOPC-interacting partners. Therefore, we further assessed the aggregation behaviour of C-terminal (PAP273-286 ) fragment of PAP248-286 and observed that DOPC possesses the ability to interfere with the aggregation behaviour of both the peptides used in the current study. Mechanistically, we propose that the presence of DOPC causes considerable inhibition of the peptide aggregation by interfering with the peptide's disordered state to β-sheet transition.",Propensity score methods and regression adjustment for analysis of nonrandomized studies with health-related quality of life outcomes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784132,Pharmacoepidemiology and drug safety,2019 05 02,The aim of this study was to investigate the potential added value of combining propensity score (PS) methods with multivariable linear regression (MLR) in estimating the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT) in nonrandomized studies with health-related quality of life (HRQoL) outcomes.,Relationship between the Vineland Adaptive Behaviour Scales and the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale IV in adults with intellectual disabilities.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784131,Journal of intellectual disability research : JIDR,2019 02 20,"Diagnoses of intellectual disability (ID) are based on three criteria: significant impairments in intellectual functioning, concurrent deficits in adaptive behaviour, and both being acquired in the developmental period.

It is noteworthy that the chiral induction model is different from the previously reported chiral TDG system using amino acid derivatives and palladium salts. The imino group generated in situ from chiral amine and aldehyde acts as the monodentate TDG to promote the C-H activation, stereoselectively generating the chiral rhodacycle bearing a chiral metal center. Moreover, the stereogenic center of the product is created and stereocontrolled during the Grignard-type addition of the C-Rh bond to aldehyde, rather than during the C-H activation step.","Anti-chlamydia IgG and IgA are insufficient to prevent endometrial chlamydia infection in women, and increased anti-chlamydia IgG is associated with enhanced risk for incident infection.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784128,"American journal of reproductive immunology (New York, N.Y. : 1989)",2019 04 23,"Chlamydia infections in women can ascend to the upper genital tract, and repeated infections are common, placing women at risk for sequelae.

In value-based care, the only true measures of quality are the outcomes that matter to patients. When outcomes are measured and reported, it fosters improvement and adoption of best practices, thus further improving outcomes. Understanding outcomes is central in providing value and represents an opportunity for redefining veterinary patient care. Value is created by improving the outcomes of patients with a particular clinical condition over the full cycle of care, which normally involves multiple specialties and care sites. To be successful, a key aspect of value based care is working as teams (integrated practice units) centered around the patient's clinical condition. As veterinary medicine has become more specialized and more complex, multidisciplinary communication and trust among the care team are paramount in providing value to patients (and clients). Use of patient-reported outcomes is an essential aspect for improving clinical care, because it enhances the connections among doctors and with patients. Designing and implementing owner-reported outcomes in veterinary clinical practice will lead to an understanding of the effects of treatments on outcomes and quality of life (QOL) of our patients from the owner's perspective, a key way to assess a veterinary patient's QOL.",Toward liquid biopsies in cancer treatment: application of circulating tumor DNA.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784124,"APMIS : acta pathologica, microbiologica, et immunologica Scandinavica",2019 05 31,"Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) refers to the fraction of cell-free DNA in a patient's blood originating from tumor cells.

Especially, early tumor detection including identification of minimal residual disease and stratification of adjuvant therapy are promising approaches. Also, ctDNA showed to be reliable in treatment monitoring and can be used to assess therapy resistance due to the broad variety of tumor subclones captured in ctDNA. Therefore, using ctDNA in the clinical setting has the potential to improve therapeutic outcomes. In the present review, we summarize the status of ctDNA in oncology with focus of being an alternative to tissue biopsies in early detection and treatment monitoring."

Pristine graphene (PG) is an un-functionalized, defect-free type of graphene that could be used as a material for neural interfacing. However, the neurotoxic effects of PG, particularly to the blood-brain barrier (BBB), have not been fully studied. The BBB separates the brain tissue from the circulating substances in the blood and is essential to maintain the brain homeostasis. The principal components of the BBB are brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMVECs), which maintain a protectively low permeability due to the expression of tight junction proteins. Here we analyzed the effects of PG on BMVECs in an in vitro model of the BBB. BMVECs were treated with PG at 0, 10, 50 and 100 μg/mL for 24 hours and viability and functional analyses of BBB integrity were performed. PG increased lactate dehydrogenase release at 50 and 100 μg/mL, suggesting the induction of necrosis. Surprisingly, 2,3,-bis(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-5-[(phenylamino)-carbonyl]-2H-tetrazolium (XTT) conversion was increased at 10 and 50 μg/mL. In contrast, XTT conversion was decreased at 100 μg/mL, suggesting the induction of cell death. In addition, 100 μg/mL PG increased DNA fragmentation, suggesting induction of apoptosis. At the same time, 50 and 100 μg/mL of PG increased the endothelial permeability, which corresponded with a decrease in the expression of the tight junction protein occludin at 100 μg/mL.

Our analysis results indicated that genes in viability modules (0 < Z-summary < 2) selected by WGCNA were more reliable for identifying crucial pathways, while gene enrichment analysis provided a wide range of pathways with a little emphasis on target pathways for lung cancer. On the basis of genes, which were classified into various modules by WGCNA, we found a significant aberration of glucose metabolism in lung cancer cells, demonstrating that the glucose metabolism has been perturbed, especially the glycolysis pathway. Our study revealed that disordered glucose metabolism might be closely associated with the carcinogenesis of lung cancer based on the integrated analysis of WGCNA and metabolomics, which could be a potential therapeutic target for lung cancer.",Establishing and developing a Teenage and Young Adult dermatology clinic with embedded specialist psychological support.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784103,Clinical and experimental dermatology,2019 03 19,"Skin conditions are common in adolescence and impart considerable psychological burden.

These sickled RBCs have strongly reduced deformability, leading to vaso-occlusive crises and chronic hemolytic anemia. To date, there are no reliable laboratory parameters or assays capable of predicting disease severity or monitoring treatment effects. We here report on the oxygenscan, a newly developed method to measure RBC deformability (expressed as Elongation Index - EI) as a function of pO2 . Upon a standardized, 22 minute, automated cycle of deoxygenation (pO2 median 16 mmHg ± 0.17) and reoxygenation, a number of clinically relevant parameters are produced in a highly reproducible manner (coefficients of variation <5%). In particular, physiological modulators of oxygen affinity, such as, pH and 2,3-diphosphoglycerate showed a significant correlation (respectively R = -0.993 and R = 0.980) with Point of Sickling (PoS5% ), which is defined as the pO2 where a 5% decrease in EI is observed during deoxygenation. Furthermore, in vitro treatment with antisickling agents, including GBT440, which alter the oxygen affinity of hemoglobin, caused a reproducible left-shift of the PoS, indicating improved deformability at lower oxygen tensions. When RBCs from 21 SCD patients were analyzed, we observed a significantly higher PoS in untreated homozygous SCD patients compared to treated patients and other genotypes. We conclude that the oxygenscan is a state-of-the-art technique that allows for rapid analysis of sickling behavior in SCD patients. The method is promising for personalized treatment, development of new treatment strategies and could have potential in prediction of complications."

However, preliminary investigations with respect to immunotherapy concentrated mostly on targeting the immune checkpoints, nowadays, emerge as the most efficient strategy to raise beneficial antitumor immune responses. Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) plays an important role in subsiding immune responses and promoting self-tolerance through suppressing the activity of T cells and promoting differentiation of regulatory T cells. PD-1 is considered as an immune checkpoint and protects against autoimmune responses through both induction of apoptosis in antigen-specific T cells and inhibiting apoptosis in regulatory T cells. Several clinical trials exerting PD-1 monoclonal antibodies as well as other immune-checkpoint blockades have had prosperous outcomes and opened new horizons in tumor immunotherapy. Nonetheless, a bulk of patients have failed to respond to these newly emerging immune-based approach and the survival rate was not satisfying. Additional strategies, especially combination therapies, has been initiated and been further promising. Attempts to identify novel and well-suited predictive biomarkers are also sensed. In this review, the promotion of cancer immunotherapy targeting PD-1 immunoinhibitory pathway is discussed.",The preparation and investigation of spinosin-phospholipid complex self-microemulsifying drug delivery system based on the absorption characteristics of spinosin.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784084,The Journal of pharmacy and pharmacology,2019 05 08,"The aim of this research was to investigate the intestinal absorption characteristics and mechanisms of spinosin (SPI), and a new dosage form was prepared to increase the intestinal absorption of SPI.","""Molecular analysis of the rare S-s- red blood cell phenotype in blood donors and patients in south-east Brazil"".",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784083,Vox sanguinis,2019 06 13,"The rare S-s- phenotype has two main molecular backgrounds. GYPB deletions give rise to the S-s-U- phenotype, which loses the expression of the U antigen, while variant GYPB alleles usually lead to the S-s-U+var phenotype, which express a variant U antigen. The S-s- phenotype is typically found in people of African origin and represents a challenge in transfusion sets, especially when S-s- patients develop anti-U. Molecular analysis is the most reliable method for determining U antigen status. We studied the molecular basis of the S-s- phenotype in donors and patients at Regional Blood Center of Ribeirão Preto.",Induction of protective immune response to intranasal administration of influenza virus-like particles in a mouse model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784082,Journal of cellular physiology,2019 02 27,"Human influenza A viruses (IAVs) cause global pandemics and epidemics, which remains a nonignorable serious concern for public health worldwide. To combat the surge of viral outbreaks, new treatments are urgently needed. Here, we design a new vaccine based on virus-like particles (VLPs) and show how intranasal administration of this vaccine triggers protective immunity, which can be exploited for the development of new therapies. H1N1 VLPs were produced in baculovirus vectors and were injected into BALB/c mice by the intramuscular (IM) or intranasal (IN) route. We found that there were significantly higher inflammatory cell and lymphocyte concentrations in bronchoalveolar lavage samples and the lungs of IN immunized mice; however, the IM group had little signs of inflammatory responses. On the basis of our results, immunization with H1N1 influenza VLP elicited a strong T cell immunity in BALB/c mice. Despite T cell immunity amplification after both IN and IM vaccination methods in mice, IN-induced T cell responses were significantly more intense than IM-induced responses, and this was likely related to an increased number of both CD11bhigh and CD103+ dendritic cells in mice lungs after IN administration of VLP. Furthermore, evaluation of interleukin-4 and interferon gamma cytokines along with several chemokine receptors showed that VLP vaccination via IN and IM routes leads to a greater CD4+ Th1 and Th2 response, respectively. Our findings indicated that VLPs represent a potential strategy for the development of an effective influenza vaccine; however, employing relevant routes for vaccination can be another important part of the universal influenza vaccine puzzle.",Feedforward inhibition ahead of ictal wavefronts is provided by both parvalbumin- and somatostatin-expressing interneurons.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784081,The Journal of physiology,2019 04 23,"There is a rapid interneuronal response to focal activity in cortex, which restrains laterally propagating activity, including spreading epileptiform activity. The interneuronal response involves intense activation of both parvalbumin- and somatostatin-expressing interneurons. Interneuronal bursting is time-locked to glutamatergic barrages in the pre-ictal period. Ca2+ imaging using conditional expression of GCaMP6f provides an accurate readout of the evolving firing patterns in both types of interneuron. The activation profiles of the two interneuronal classes are temporally offset, with the parvalbumin population being activated first, and typically, at higher rates.",The brain cognitive reserve hypothesis: A review with emphasis on the contribution of nuclear medicine neuroimaging techniques.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784080,Journal of cellular physiology,2019 02 28,"Neuropathological and clinical evidence indicates that the clinical expression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) occurs as neuropathology exceeds the brain reserve capacity. The brain or cognitive reserve (BCR) hypothesis states that high premorbid intelligence, education, and an active and stimulating lifestyle provide reserve capacity, which acts as a buffer against the cognitive deficits due to accumulating neuropathology. Neuroimaging studies that assessed the BCR hypothesis are critically reviewed with emphasis on study design and statistical analysis. Many studies were performed in the last two decades owing to the increasing availability of positron emission tomography (PET) and PET/computed tomography scanners and to the synthesis of new radiopharmaceuticals, including tracers for amyloid and tau proteins. Studies with different tracers provided complementary consistent results supporting the BCR hypothesis. Many studies were appropriately designed with a measure of reserve, a measure of brain anatomy/function/neuropathology, and a measure of cognitive functions that are necessary. Most of the early studies were performed with PET and [ 18 F]fluorodeoxyglucose, and occasionally with [ 15 O]water, reporting a significant association between higher occupation/education and lower glucose metabolism (blood flow) in associative temporo-parietal cortex in patients with AD and also in patients with MCI, after correcting for the degree in the cognitive impairment. On the contrary, performances on several neuropsychological tests increased with increasing education for participants with elevated [ 11 C]PiB uptake. Studies with the tracers specific for tau protein showed that patients with AD with elevated tau deposits had higher cognitive performances compared with patients with similar levels of tau deposits. BCR in AD is also associated with a preserved cholinergic function. The BCR hypothesis has been validated with methodologically sound study designs and sophisticated neuroimaging techniques using different radiotracers and providing an explanation for neuropathological and clinical observations on patients with AD.",Inhibition of the CD40/CD40L complex protects mice against ALI-induced pancreas degradation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784079,Transfusion,2019 03 06,"Acute lung injury (ALI) is a severe complication of transfusion.

Oxidative stress due to excess reactive oxygen species (ROS) is considered to be an important factor in aging and related disease, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the antioxidative effects of metformin and its underlying mechanisms in neuronal cells is not known. In the present study, we showed that metformin, in clinically relevant concentrations, protected neuronal PC12 cells from H2 O2 -induced cell death. Metformin signiﬁcantly ameliorated cell death due to H2 O2 insult by restoring abnormal changes in nuclear morphology, intracellular ROS, lactate dehydrogenase, and mitochondrial membrane potential induced by H2 O2 . Hoechst staining assay and flow cytometry analysis revealed that metformin significantly reduced the apoptosis in PC12 cells exposed to H2 O2 . Western blot analysis further demonstrated that metformin stimulated the phosphorylation and activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in PC12 cells, while application of AMPK inhibitor compound C, or knockdown of the expression of AMPK by specific small interfering RNA or short hairpin RNA blocked the protective effect of metformin. Similar results were obtained in primary cultured hippocampal neurons. Taken together, these results indicated that metformin is able to protect neuronal cells from oxidative injury, at least in part, via the activation of AMPK. As metformin is comparatively cheaper with much less side effects in clinic, our findings support its potential to be a drug for prevention and treatment of aging and aging-related diseases."

However, it is still unclear whether KCNQ1 overlapping transcript 1 (KCNQ1OT1) could affect DR. In this study, regarding quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assay, KCNQ1OT1 level was upregulated while microRNA-1470 (miR-1470) was decreased in DR patients and human retinal endothelial cells. High KCNQ1OT1 expression was correlated with DR stage and low visual function. Using miR-1470 mimic or knockdown of KCNQ1OT1 could lead to the similar phenomenon; phospho-AKT, Bax, B-cell lymphoma 2, and cleaved poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) were regulated, while vascularization was inhibited and apoptosis was promoted. Regarding bioinformatics analysis and in vitro dual luciferase reporter assay, there should be a negative correlation between KCNQ1OT1 and miR-1470. Additionally, mRNA of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) was proved as the target of miR-1470 and EGFR targeting by miR-1470 initiated KCNQ1OT1 deficiency-induced apoptosis and promoted proliferation. KCNQ1OT1 and miR-1470 were proved to be the promoter and repressor of EGFR, respectively. The results suggested that KCNQ1OT1 could sponge miR-1470 and further regulate EGFR in DR.",Combinatorial effect of blueberry extracts and oxaliplatin in human colon cancer cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784064,Journal of cellular physiology,2019 02 20,"The use of natural compounds to potentiate the effect of drugs and lower their adverse effects is an active area of research. The objective is to determine the effect of combined blueberry extracts (BE) and oxaliplatin (OX) in colon cancer cells. The results demonstrated that treatments of BE/OX showed inhibitory effects on HCT-116 cell and nontoxic effect on CCD-18Co normal colon cells. Flow cytometry analysis indicated that treatment with the BE, OX or in combination could induce G0/G1 cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, increase of reactive oxygen species, and induce loss of mitochondrial membrane potential in HCT-116 cells. Furthermore, after treatments, the expression of inflammatory cytokines was decreased, cyclin D1 and CDK4 were decreased; caspases-3 and 9 were activated; the Akt/Bad/Bcl-2 pathway was modulated. Moreover, the combination treatment had a considerably higher growth inhibitory effect on human colon cancer HCT-116 cells than that of BE or oxaliplatin alone. Our results showed that BE increased the anticolon cancer effect of OX making it an attractive strategy as adjuvant therapy to potentially reduce the adverse side effects associated with chemotherapeutic drugs.",Icariin attenuates methotrexate chemotherapy-induced bone marrow microvascular damage and bone loss in rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784063,Journal of cellular physiology,2019 02 20,"Methotrexate (MTX), a widely used antimetabolite in paediatric cancer to treatment, has been widely reported to cause bone loss and bone marrow (BM) microvascular (particularly sinusoids) damage. Investigations must now investigate how MTX-induced bone loss and microvasculature damage can be attenuated/prevented. In the present study, we examined the potency of icariin, an herbal flavonoid, in reducing bone loss and the dilation/damage of BM sinusoids in rats caused by MTX treatment. Groups of young rats were treated with five daily MTX injections (0.75 mg/kg) with and without icariin oral supplementation until Day 9 after the first MTX injection. Histological analyses showed a significant reduction in the bone volume/tissue volume (BV/TV) fraction (%) and trabecular number in the metaphysis trabecular bone of MTX-treated rats, but no significant changes in trabecular thickness and trabecular spacing. However, the BV/TV (%) and trabecular number were found to be significantly higher in MTX + icariin-treated rats than those of MTX alone-treated rats. Gene expression analyses showed that icariin treatment maintained expression of osteogenesis-related genes but suppressed the induction of adipogenesis-related genes in bones of MTX-treated rats. In addition, icariin treatment attenuated MTX-induced dilation of BM sinusoids and upregulated expression of endothelial cell marker CD31 in the metaphysis bone of icariin + MTX-treated rats. Furthermore, in vitro studies suggest that icariin treatment can potentially enhance the survival of cultured rat sinusoidal endothelial cells against cytotoxic effect of MTX and promote their migration and tube formation abilities, which is associated with enhanced production of nitric oxide.","Influence of forkhead box protein 3 polymorphisms (rs2232365, rs3761548) with the outcome of pregnancy: A meta-analysis.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784062,Journal of cellular physiology,2019 02 20,"Dysfunction of regulatory T cells (Tregs) may contribute to certain immune-related pregnancy complications. Forkhead box protein 3 (FOXP3) is the key transcription factor of Treg. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the possible association between FOXP3 polymorphisms -924A/G (rs2232365) and -3279C/A (rs3761548) and immune-related pregnancy complications. After reviewing 78 fully published studies, 10 studies fulfilled previously defined eligibility criteria and were used for meta-analysis. Two single nucleotide polymorphisms showed a significant correlation with increased or reduced risk for immune-related pregnancy complications. For rs3761548, women with allele A were significantly at a higher risk than women carrying allele C (odds ratio = 1.29, 95% confidence interval: 1.20-1.38; p = 0.001). For rs2232365, women with GG or AG genotype were at a higher risk than women with genotype AA, thereby, allele G was significantly associated with a higher risk than allele A. Our meta-analysis supports the notion that immune-related pregnancy complications might be linked to genetic variations in the FOXP3 gene.",Inactivating the ubiquitin ligase Parkin suppresses cell proliferation and induces apoptosis in human keloids.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784061,Journal of cellular physiology,2019 02 20,"Keloids are a common type of pathological skin healing, characterized by the destruction of the vascular network. Thus, keloids often exhibit anoxic conditions. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) is a core factor that mediates hypoxia stress responses and allows the cells to adapt to low-oxygen conditions. In the current study, we identified that Parkin acted as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, contributing to the degradation of HIF-1α in keloid fibroblasts (KFs). Silencing of Parkin in KFs upregulated HIF-1α expression and prolonged its protein half-life. Furthermore, Parkin influenced transforming growth factor β (TGF-β)/Smad signaling by targeting HIF-1α. Under hypoxic conditions, silencing Parkin enhanced KF proliferation and inhibited apoptosis through the TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway. Notably, metformin, an antidiabetic drug, could significantly induce Parkin expression and enhance the interaction between Parkin and HIF-1α. As a result, we revealed an important mechanism for Parkin in keloid development and suggested that targeting Parkin could be an alternative method for keloid treatment.",Clinical and biological features of paediatric acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) with primary induction failure in the Japanese Paediatric Leukaemia/Lymphoma Study Group AML-05 study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784060,British journal of haematology,2019 04 05,"The prognosis of paediatric acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) with primary induction failure (PIF) is extremely poor, and effective treatment strategies have not been established.

The 3-year overall survival rate of the 41 PIF patients was 19.0%. High leucocyte count, M7 morphology, and unfavourable genetic aberrations, such as FLT3-internal tandem duplication, NUP98-NSD1 and high MECOM or PRDM16 expression, were risk factors for PIF. More effective treatment strategies based on leukaemia biology need to be urgently explored.","From identification to functional characterization of cyriotoxin-1a, an antinociceptive toxin from the spider Cyriopagopus schioedtei.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784059,British journal of pharmacology,2019 04 24,The NaV 1.7 channel is highly expressed in dorsal root ganglia of the sensory nervous system and plays a central role in the pain signalling process.

The cause of dyspnoea is often multifactorial, and may cause considerable psychological distress and suffering. Dyspnoea is often undertreated and good symptom control is less frequently achieved in people with dyspnoea than in people with other symptoms of advanced cancer, such as pain and nausea. The exact mechanism of action of corticosteroids in managing dyspnoea is unclear, yet corticosteroids are commonly used in palliative care for a variety of non-specific indications, including pain, nausea, anorexia, fatigue and low mood, despite being associated with a wide range of adverse effects. In view of their widespread use, it is important to seek evidence of the effects of corticosteroids for the management of cancer-related dyspnoea.",Assessing subsistence and its relationship to cultural complexity in the late prehistoric upper Midwest: A new perspective provided by dental health.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784057,American journal of physical anthropology,2019 03 04,"Previous researchers have assumed that the Late Prehistoric Oneota were less reliant on maize agriculture than their Middle Mississippian neighbors to the south.

Until 2017, patients with advanced disease were typically treated with conventional chemotherapies, with a median response duration of 3 months. Increased evidence of the role of the immune system in controlling this cancer has paved the way for immune-based therapies, with programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1)/programmed cell death protein ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitors at the frontline. Avelumab, an anti-PD-L1 antibody, was the first-ever drug approved in advanced MCC after showing meaningful efficacy in a second-line setting. Objective responses were observed in one-third of patients and, most importantly, were durable with half of patients and one-third of patients still alive at 1 and 2 years, respectively. When used in a first-line setting, PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors (avelumab, pembrolizumab, nivolumab) are even more promising as objective responses are observed in approximately 50-70% of patients within the first 4-8 weeks of treatment. Safety profiles are acceptable with 10-20% of patients experiencing adverse events grade ≥ 3. PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors are considered the standard of care in advanced MCC and are currently being investigated in the adjuvant and neoadjuvant settings. However, innovative treatments are still needed in the metastatic setting, as approximately 50% of these patients will not persistently respond to currently available immunotherapies, and no predictors of response are available yet. Therefore, other immunotherapeutic strategies are now being investigated-ideally in combinations-to enhance the various aspects of the immune response against tumoral cells.","A Preliminary Study Evaluating the Safety and Efficacy of Bumetanide, an NKCC1 Inhibitor, in Patients with Drug-Resistant Epilepsy.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784026,CNS drugs,2019 03 29,"Dysregulation of cation-chloride cotransporters NKCC1 and KCC2 expression was shown to be related to drug-resistant epilepsy.

In this systematic review, a comprehensive overview of these models is provided. A systematic review was performed in MEDLINE and Scopus for articles using physical (e.g. dolls) and mathematical (e.g. computer simulations) biomechanical models for IHI-ST. After deduplication, the studies were independently screened by two researchers using PRISMA methodology and data extracted from the papers is represented in a ""7-steps description"", addressing the different processes occurring during IHI-ST. Eleven papers on physical models and 23 papers on mathematical models were included after the selection process. In both categories, some models focus on describing gross head kinematics during IHI-ST events, while others address the behavior of internal head- and eye structures in various levels of detail. In virtually all physical and mathematical models analyzed, injury thresholds are derived from scaled non-infant data. Studies focusing on head kinematics often use injury thresholds derived from impact studies. It remains unclear to what extent these thresholds reflect the failure thresholds of infant biological material. Future research should therefore focus on investigating failure thresholds of infant biological material as well as on possible alternative injury mechanism and alternative injury criteria for IHI-ST.",Liver fibrosis is associated with cognitive impairment in people living with HIV.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784024,Infection,2019 02 20,Our aim was to better explore the association between liver fibrosis (LF) and neurocognitive impairment (NCI) in people living with HIV (PLWH).,Treatment Decisions for Metastatic Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma in Older Patients: The Role of TKIs and Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784023,Drugs & aging,2019 05 07,"Given the underrepresentation of older patients in registration trials for metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC), data to support the use of any particular systemic therapy over others, based on age, is limited. This is further complicated by clinical trials not commonly reporting adverse events by age. Thus, recommendations on treatment of older patients with mRCC are generally extrapolated from data on younger patients enrolled in these trials, which may not be ideal as many older patients are frail, have age-related organ dysfunction, or have multiple medical co-morbidities. In the last decade, the treatment landscape for mRCC has drastically changed with the approval of more than ten targeted therapies, as well as immune checkpoint inhibitors. Thus, treatment selection and sequencing of treatments can be especially challenging for clinicians. We begin this review by analyzing the available efficacy and toxicity data of these treatments in younger and older patients. We also discuss a network meta-analysis that compares the efficacy of these agents in older patients with mRCC. Utilizing this data, we suggest that nivolumab plus ipilimumab and cabozantinib may be favored for first-line treatment of specific populations of older patients. For salvage treatment, we suggest that cabozantinib may be the preferred agent for older patients.",Multifunctional nanoparticles for intracellular drug delivery and photoacoustic imaging of mesenchymal stem cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784022,Drug delivery and translational research,2019 05 12,"Strategies that control the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) and enable image-guided cell implantation and longitudinal monitoring could advance MSC-based therapies for bone defects and injuries. Here we demonstrate a multifunctional nanoparticle system that delivers resveratrol (RESV) intracellularly to improve osteogenesis and enables photoacoustic imaging of MSCs. RESV-loaded nanoparticles (RESV-NPs), formulated from poly (lactic-co-glycolic) acid and iron oxide, enhanced the stability of RESV by 18-fold and served as photoacoustic tomography (PAT) contrast for MSCs. Pre-loading MSCs with RESV-NP upregulated RUNX2 expression with a resultant increase in mineralization by 27% and 45% compared to supplementation with RESV-NP and free RESV, respectively, in 2-dimensional cultures. When grown in polyethylene glycol-based hydrogels, MSCs pre-loaded with RESV-NPs increased the overall level and homogeneity of mineralization compared to those supplemented with free RESV or RESV-NP. The PAT detected RESV-NP-loaded MSCs with a resolution of 1500 cells/μL, which ensured imaging of MSCs upon encapsulation in a PEG-based hydrogel and implantation within the rodent cranium. Significantly, RESV-NP-loaded MSCs in hydrogels did not show PAT signal dilution over time or a reduction in signal upon osteogenic differentiation. This multifunctional NP platform has the potential to advance translation of stem cell-based therapies, by improving stem cell function and consistency via intracellular drug delivery, and enabling the use of a promising emerging technology to monitor cells in a clinically relevant manner.",Les traits d'identité culturelle en lien avec le statut d'immigrant et l'ethnicité : quel lien avec les symptômes de détresse psychologique et les symptômes dépressifs dans la main-d'œuvre canadienne?

As listeners, we make use of background knowledge - about the speaker, about entities and concepts, about previous utterances - in order to infer the speaker's intended meaning. But even if there is consensus that these sources of information are a necessary component of linguistic communication, it is another matter entirely to provide a thorough, quantitative accounting for context's interaction with language. When does context matter? What kinds of context matter in which kinds of domains? The empirical investigation of these questions is inhibited by a number of factors: the challenge of quantifying language, the boundless combinations of domains and types of context to be measured, and the challenge of selecting and applying a given construct to natural language data. In response to these factors, we introduce and demonstrate a methodological framework for testing the importance of contextual information in inferring speaker intentions from text.

DART MS was carried out to analyze different polarity compounds including organophosphorus pesticides, amino acids, hormones, and poly brominated diphenyl ethers by using He and N2 as DART gas, respectively. The unexpectedly characteristic ionization reactions, including replacement reaction where the sulfur atom of P=S group, were replaced by oxygen atom, oxidation ([M + nO + H]+ or [M + nO-H]- (n = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)), and hydrogen loss (loss of two hydrogens) rapidly occurred in situ in the presence of N2 under ambient conditions without any additives.

Graphical Abstract.",Evolutionary Models of Leadership : Tests and Synthesis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784003,"Human nature (Hawthorne, N.Y.)",2019 03 29,"This study tested four theoretical models of leadership with data from the ethnographic record. The first was a game-theoretical model of leadership in collective actions, in which followers prefer and reward a leader who monitors and sanctions free-riders as group size increases. The second was the dominance model, in which dominant leaders threaten followers with physical or social harm. The third, the prestige model, suggests leaders with valued skills and expertise are chosen by followers who strive to emulate them. The fourth proposes that in small-scale, kin-based societies, men with high neural capital are best able to achieve and maintain positions of social influence (e.g., as headmen) and thereby often become polygynous and have more offspring than other men, which positively selects for greater neural capital. Using multiple search strategies we identified more than 1000 texts relevant to leadership in the Probability Sample of 60 cultures from the Human Relations Area Files (HRAF). We operationalized the model with variables and then coded all retrieved text records on the presence or absence of evidence for each of these 24 variables. We found mixed support for the collective action model, broad support for components of the prestige leadership style and the importance of neural capital and polygyny among leaders, but more limited support for the dominance leadership style. We found little evidence, however, of emulation of, or prestige-biased learning toward, leaders. We found that improving collective actions, having expertise, providing counsel, and being respected, having high neural capital, and being polygynous are common properties of leaders, which warrants a synthesis of the collective action, prestige, and neural capital and reproductive skew models. We sketch one such synthesis involving high-quality decision-making and other computational services.",New otonecine-type pyrrolizidine alkaloid from Petasites japonicus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784002,Journal of natural medicines,2019 06 10,"One new otonecine-type pyrrolizidine alkaloid secopetasitenine (1), along with petasitenine (fukinotoxine, 2), neopetasitenine (3), and senkirkine (4), was isolated from the whole plant of Petasites japonicus.

Thus, precise diagnosis of fungal sensitization is important. Mold allergen extracts are difficult to standardize, but component-resolved allergy diagnosis may be an alternative to replace extract-based tests. In this research, asthmatic and non-asthmatic subjects were studied for their sensitization to Aspergillus fumigatus (Asp f), Cladosporium herbarum (Cla h), Penicillium chrysogenum (Pen ch), Alternaria alternata (Alt a), and Aspergillus versicolor (Asp v). Extract-based tests were applied using the skin prick test (SPT) and allergen-specific immunoglobulin E (sIgE). Subjects with extract-based sensitization to Asp f or Alt a were further investigated for sIgE response to recombinant (r) single mold allergens. At least one mold sensitization was found in about 50% of asthmatic and non-asthmatics with the most frequent sensitization to Alt a, followed by Pen ch, Asp f, Cla h, and Asp v. Interestingly, sensitization rate to individual mold species was always higher in asthmatics and was only significant for Pen ch. The component-resolved diagnosis with the sum of rAsp f 1 - rAsp f 4 plus rAsp f 6 matched the extract-based results (SPT and/or sIgE) in 50% of asthmatics and 46% of non-asthmatics, whereas, rAlt a 1 covered 59% of asthmatics and 50% non-asthmatics of extract-based Alt a sensitization.

Several studies have demonstrated that Brucella can survive and replicate intracellularly, thereby provoking impaired maturation of DCs. Therefore, the interaction between DCs and Brucella becomes an interesting model to study the immune response. In this review, we first will describe the most common techniques for DCs differentiation in vitro as well as general features of brucellosis. Then, the interaction of DCs and Brucella, including pathogen recognition, molecular mechanisms of bacterial pathogenesis, and intracellular trafficking of Brucella to subvert innate response, will be reviewed. Finally, we will debate diversity in immunological DC response and the controversial role of DC activation against Brucella infection."

Since this study, these methodologies have been applied to a number of other mouse models of genetic deafness with varying degrees of success, lending promise for future clinical application of this burgeoning technology.

From here the secreted protein moves with the natural flow of the aqueous humor via a pressure gradient and is directed toward the outflow tissues. Such a delivery can be employed to modulate outflow facility and intraocular pressure through interactions at the trabecular meshwork and Schlemm's canal.

Indeed, the first gene therapy to receive FDA approval in the United States is an AAV-based treatment for the inherited retinal disease, Leber congenital amaurosis-2. Voretigene neparvovec (Luxturna™) is delivered to patients via subretinal (SR) injection, an invasive surgical procedure that requires detachment of photoreceptors (PRs) from the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). It has been reported that subretinal administration of vector under the cone-exclusive fovea leads to a loss of central retinal structure and visual acuity in some patients. Due to its technical difficulty and potential risks, alternatives to SR injection have been explored in primates. Intravitreally (Ivt) delivered AAV transduces inner retina and foveal cones, but with low efficiency. Novel AAV capsid variants identified via rational design or directed evolution have offered only incremental improvements, and have failed to promote pan-inner retinal transduction or significant outer retinal transduction beyond the fovea. Problems with retinal transduction by Ivt-delivered AAV include dilution in the vitreous, potential antibody-mediated neutralization of capsid in this nonimmune privileged space, and the presence of the inner limiting membrane (ILM), a basement membrane separating the vitreous from the neural retina. We have developed an alternative ""subILM"" injection method that overcomes all three hurdles. Specifically, vector is placed in a surgically induced, hydrodissected space between the ILM and neural retina. We have shown that subILM injection promotes more efficient retinal transduction by AAV than Ivt injection, and results in uniform and extensive transduction of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) beneath the subILM bleb. We have also demonstrated transduction of Muller glia, ON bipolar cells, and photoreceptors by subILM injection. Our results confirm that the ILM is a major barrier to transduction by AAV in primate retina and that, when it is circumvented, the efficiency and depth to which AAV2 promotes transduction of multiple retinal cell classes is greatly enhanced. Here we describe in detail methods for vector preparation, vector dilution, and subILM injection as performed in macaque (Macaca sp.).",Peripheral AAV Injection for Retrograde Transduction of Dorsal Root and Trigeminal Ganglia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30783977,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",2019 03 27,"Adeno-associated Virus (AAV) vectors are useful vehicles for delivering transgenes to a number of different tissues and organs in vivo.

Recently there has been progress in delivering AAV vectors to neurons of the peripheral nervous system (PNS) following application of vectors to the peripheral epithelium, such as the skin or eye. This delivery only requires treatment of the epithelium to access the underlying nerve termini, and following treatment the vectors are transported retrogradely to the cell bodies of these neurons in the ganglia, such as dorsal root ganglia (DRG) or trigeminal ganglia (TG).

However, the delivery of rAAVs across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and entry into the brain remains a major challenge for rAAV-based gene therapy. To circumvent this limitation, transcranial MRI-guided focused ultrasound (MRIgFUS) combined with intravenously injected microbubbles has been used to transiently and reversibly increase BBB permeability in targeted brain regions. Systemic administration of rAAVs at the time of sonication with focused ultrasound (FUS) facilitates the passage of rAAVs through the BBB and into the brain parenchyma. We and others have demonstrated that FUS-mediated rAAV delivery to the brain results in efficient transduction and transgene expression in vivo. Using this approach, the dose of intravenously injected rAAV variants that can cross the BBB can be reduced by 100 times, achieving significant transgene expression in the brain parenchyma with reduced peripheral transduction. Moreover, this strategy can be used to deliver rAAV variants that do not cross the BBB from the blood to selected brain regions. Here, we provide a detailed protocol for FUS-induced BBB permeability for targeted rAAV delivery to the brain of adult mice and rats."

The IQD (IQ67-domain) family plays an important role in various abiotic stress responses in plant species. However, the roles of IQD genes in the Chinese cabbage response to abiotic stress remain unclear. Here, 35 IQD genes, from BrIQD1 to BrIQD35, were identified in Chinese cabbage (Brassica rapa ssp. pekinensis). Based on the phylogenetic analysis, these genes were clustered into three subfamilies (I-III), and members within the same subfamilies shared conserved exon-intron distribution and motif composition. The 35 BrIQD genes were unevenly distributed on 9 of the 10 chromosomes with 4 segmental duplication events. Ka/Ks ratios showed that the duplicated BrIQDs had mainly experienced strong purifying selection. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction of 35 BrIQDs under PEG6000 indicated that BrIQD5 was significantly induced by PEG6000. To verify BrIQD5 function, BrIQD5 was heterologously overexpressed in tobacco and was silenced in Chinese cabbage. BrIQD5-overexpressed plants showed more tolerance to drought stress than wild-type plants, while BrIQD5-silenced plants in Chinese cabbage showed decreased drought tolerance. Additionally, six BrIQD5 potential interactive proteins were isolated by the yeast two-hybrid assay, including BrCaMa, BrCaMb and four other stress-related proteins. Motif IQ1 of BrIQD5 is important for the interaction with BrCaMa and BrCaMb, and the isoleucine in motif IQ1 is an essential amino acid for calmodulin binding to BrIQD5. The identification and cloning of the new Chinese cabbage drought tolerance genes will promote the drought-resistant breeding of Chinese cabbage and help to better understand the mechanism of IQD involved in the drought tolerance of plants.",The C-terminal WD40 repeats on the TOPLESS co-repressor function as a protein-protein interaction surface.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30783952,Plant molecular biology,2019 05 27,"The two predicted WD40 propellers on TOPLESS function as protein-protein interaction domains. The 1st WD40 propeller mediates interaction with RAV1, and the 2nd WD40 propeller mediates interaction with VRN5. The TOPLESS/TOPLESS-RELATED (TPL/TPR) co-repressor family proteins are known to interact with a wide variety of proteins including transcription factors, Mediator subunits, histone deacetylases, and histone tails. Through these interactions, TPL/TPR act to repress transcription in an increasingly diverse array of plant pathways. Proteins that bind TPL/TPR typically contain one or more Repression Domains (RDs) that mediate the interaction. For example, the well-characterized Ethylene response factor-associated Amphiphilic Repression (EAR) motif is known to facilitate interaction by binding the TOPLESS Domain (TPD) located in the N-terminus. Here we show that in yeast two-hybrid assays, the non-EAR protein, Related to ABI3/VP1-1 (RAV1), binds a novel region located within the first nine WD40-repeats of TPL. Protein modeling and in silico analysis suggest that these nine WD40 repeats may form the first of two WD40 propellers located on C-terminus of TPL. The interaction between RAV1 and the 1st WD40 propeller is conserved with another RAV family member, TEMPRANILLO1 (TEM1) and is mediated by the B3 Repression Domain (BRD) located on both RAV1 and TEM1. Also, the predicted 2nd WD40 propeller was shown in yeast cells to bind Vernalization 5 (VRN5), which contains several unconfirmed partial RDs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the 1st WD40 propeller of TPL can form a complex with RAV1 both in yeast and in Arabidopsis protoplasts.",Clinical significance of low transaminase levels in children with inflammatory bowel disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30783951,World journal of pediatrics : WJP,2019 05 11,"Low alanine aminotransaminase (LALT) levels may be seen in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), but there has been no study about the frequency and its clinical significance.

A functional single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in EGF promoter region (EGF+61 A>G-rs4444903) has been associated with cancer susceptibility. Yet, in lung cancer, the EGF+61 A>G role is unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate the risk of lung cancer associated with EGF+61 A>G SNP in the Brazilian population. For that, 669 lung cancer patients and 1104 controls were analyzed. EGF+61 A>G genotype was assessed by PCR-RFLP and TaqMan genotyping assay. Both patients and controls were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. As expected, uni- and multivariate analyses showed that tobacco consumption and age were significant risk factors for lung cancer. The genotype frequencies in lung cancer patients were 27.3% of AA, 47.4% of AG and 25.3% of GG, and for controls were 25.3% of AA, 51.6% of AG and 23.1% of GG. The allele frequencies were 51.1% of A and 48.9% of G for both cases and controls. No significant differences for the three genotypes (AA, AG and GG-codominant model) were observed between cases and controls. We then grouped AG and GG (recessive model) genotypes, as well as AA and AG (dominant model), and again, no significant differences were also found. This is the largest study to explore EGF+61 A>G polymorphism association with lung cancer risk and suggests that this SNP is not a risk factor for lung cancer in the Brazilian population.",Arsenic-induced inflammation in workers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30783936,Molecular biology reports,2019 04 11,"Occupational and environmental exposures to metal and metalloids can result in neurotoxicity and immunotoxicity. Selenium (Se) is essential for the proper functioning of neutrophils, macrophages, natural killer (NK) cells, T-lymphocytes and other immune mechanisms, while zinc (Zn) is a trace element essential for basic cell activities, including cell growth and differentiation. Arsenic (As) may lead to different types of immunosuppressive effects. This study consisted of 62 male workers, who had been exposed to arsenic for different durations and 73 non-exposed male workers (control group) with no history of occupational toxic metal exposure. Whole blood and serum samples were taken from each participant for immunological, toxicological and routine analysis during their annual periodical examination. Arsenic, selenium and zinc levels were determined by the ICP-MS and cytokines, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α, sE-selectin and VCAM-1, were measured by ELISA. There were statistically significant differences (p < 0.001) between control and As-exposed group in As (1.37 ± 0.42 vs. 4.27 ± 1.54 µg/L) and Se levels (106.37 ± 48.04 vs. 74.70 ± 30.45 µg/L). The changing levels of As, Zn and Se seems to affect the severity of inflammatory reactions based on IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-α levels (r = 0.755, r = 0.679 and r = 0.617, respectively, for all p < 0.01). Selenium was found to have a suppressive effect on cytokines, as evidenced by Pearson correlations and regression analysis. These findings support the need to closely monitor Se levels in individuals exposed to arsenic and benefits for Se supplementation in the case of arsenic exposure, occupationally or environmentally.",Colistin induced peripheral neurotoxicity involves mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress in mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30783935,Molecular biology reports,2019 04 11,"Polymyxin is a critical antibiotic against the infection caused by multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria. Neurotoxicity is one of main dose-limiting factors. The present study aimed to investigate the underlying molecular mechanism on colistin induced peripheral neurotoxicity using a mouse model. Forty mice were divided into control, colistin 1-, 3- and 7-day groups, the mice were intravenously injected with saline or colistin (sulfate) at the dose of 15 mg/kg/day for 1, 3 and 7 days, respectively. The results showed that, colistin treatment for 7 days markedly resulted in the demyelination, axonal degeneration and mitochondria swelling in the mice's sciatic tissues. Colistin treatment induces oxidative stress as well as the increases of mitochondrial permeability transition, decreases of membrane potential (ΔΨm) and activities of mitochondrial respiratory chain in the mice's sciatic nerve tissues. Furthermore, in the colistin-7 day group, adenosine-triphosphate (ATP) level Na+/K+-ATPase activity decreased to 75.2% (p < 0.01) and 80.1% (p < 0.01), respectively. Meanwhile, colistin treatment down-regulates the expression of protein kinase B (Akt) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) mRNAs and up-regulates the expression of Bax and caspase-3 mRNAs. Our results reveal that colistin induced sciatic nerves damage involves oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction and the inhibition of Akt/mTOR pathway.","Prediction of O3 in the respiratory system of children using the artificial neural network model and with selection of input based on gamma test, Ahvaz, Iran.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30783934,Environmental science and pollution research international,2019 06 13,"In recent years, concerns over the issue of air pollution have increased as one of the significant environmental and health problems.

The effects of using ultrasonic and microwave on synthesizing Pb2+, Zn2+, and Cu2+ imprinted mesoporous adsorbents (Pb-IMA-UM, Zn-IMA-UM, and Cu-IMA-UM) and their dynamic adsorption properties were studied. The microstructure and composition of the ion-imprinted mesoporous adsorbents were discussed in detail by TEM, FTIR, N2 adsorption-desorption, XRD, and EDS. The pore sizes of mesoporous absorbents were improved more uniformly by using ultrasonic agitation than magnetic stirring. The elution efficiency of imprinting ions can be enhanced by microwave elution. Prepared Pb-IMA-UM, Zn-IMA-UM, and Cu-IMA-UM were used for dynamic adsorption study of heavy metals. The detected optimal feed rate was 20.0 mL/min and the influent concentration was 60 mg/L; the equilibrium adsorption capacities of Pb-IMA-UM, Cu-IMA-UM, and Zn-IMA-UM could reach 198 mg/g, 51.5 mg/g, and 57.3 mg/g, respectively. The dynamic regeneration performance of the adsorbent was also investigated with the Cu-IMA-UM sample. The adsorption rate remained above 89% after five dynamic regeneration experiments. At last, the actual wastewater from an electroplating industry was used as the research object. Three groups of dynamic adsorption coefficient contours of Pb-IMA-UM, Zn-IMA-UM, and Cu-IMA-UM were obtained when influents flowed into three adsorption columns separately. The experimental results showed that an ion-imprinted adsorbent had a much better adsorption capacity of imprinted ions under the various metals mixed conditions.","Assessment of the water resource carrying capacity based on the ecological footprint: a case study in Zhangjiakou City, North China.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30783932,Environmental science and pollution research international,2019 06 13,"With the rapid economic development in the past decades, industrialization and urbanization in China has also rapidly developed and will continue in the next decades. However, the regional water shortage has posed great challenges for the sustainable development of big cities especially in north China. Here, we used the water ecological footprint model combined with the system dynamic model to assess the water resource carrying capacity and its sustainability in Zhangjiakou City, a typical water shortage city in north China. The calculated results showed that irrigation was the largest water consumer in Zhangjiakou. There existed a clear gap between water supply and water consumption in this city and such a gap is demonstrated by the high water resource pressure index. Our predicted results based on the water resource ecological footprint and the system dynamic model showed that although the improving water use efficiency has relieved the regional water shortage pressure, the efficiency gained would be to a large degree offset by increased water demands due to the increasing economic development. The annual average water shortage in Zhangjiakou in 2007-2050 would be up to 8.53 × 108 m3, nearly half of the total local average annual water resource. To deal with the severe water shortage over the next three decades, great attention should be paid to scientific water resource managements and water pollution control. This research provides a long-term view of water resource pressure and provides recommendations for a sustainable water use under the rapid regional socioeconomic development.","Evaluation of the environmental noise problems in holiday villages: a case study from Antalya, Turkey.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30783931,Environmental science and pollution research international,2019 06 13,"Not only the appeal of the sun, natural, and historical beauties but also architectural features and business advantages of the accommodation facilities emerge as important factors in tourism development. Holiday villages differ from other types of accommodation facilities in terms of their functions and services. It is important to provide tourists acceptable levels of comfort in holiday villages offering various functions. One of these comfort conditions is acoustic comfort, which involves noise control. Noise emitted from various indoor and outdoor facilities is the main component impacting acoustic comfort in holiday villages. In this study, a holiday village in Antalya, Turkey with an open area of 120,000 m2 was examined to identify noise exposure conditions of outdoor areas. Pools, restaurants, animation areas, playgrounds, and courts are the main outdoor noise sources in this holiday village. The noise emitted by these sources during daytime (Ld) and evening time (Le) are shown in noise maps. The open areas affected by 65 LAeq noise level extend to an area of 55,500 and 21,000 m2 during Ld and Le, respectively. With the noise barriers around the main noise sources, impacted open areas are reduced by 13% in Ld and 12% in Le. The results of this study clearly reveals the importance of resolving the issue of environmental noise in the most efficient and cost-effective way in terms of settlement and planning, especially in areas with dominant noise sources like holiday villages."

Research and theory suggest that children with strong regulatory skills may be better equipped to manage the complex academic, social, and emotional demands of early learning and school environments; and alternatively, deficits in regulatory skills can lead to problems in school adjustment, academic outcomes, and other measures of well-being. In this paper, we bring together two regulation-related research traditions: executive function (EF) and effortful control (EC). We highlight the common features of EF and EC and their key differences. Building on findings from these two research traditions, we propose an integrated model of regulation for school-based interventions and other applied settings that can serve as an organizing framework for a broad set of skills across the cognitive, social, and emotion domains that are critical to school success. Using a developmental psychopathology framework, we illustrate how an integrated model of regulation can inform more nuanced and targeted approaches to research, policy, and intervention for both special and universal populations.

In the present study we manipulated focal and nonfocal PM cue conditions, as well as participants' focus on different aspects of the PM/ongoing task set, using the methodology to capture dynamic computer mouse movements. The software captured mouse trajectories during lexical decisions and PM responses. We replicated many findings typical in the PM literature, including the accuracy advantage for focal over nonfocal conditions and longer ongoing-task response times for nonfocal conditions. Participants' movement trajectories during PM responses revealed evidence for both spontaneous-retrieval and strategic-monitoring processes in focal and nonfocal PM retrieval conditions. During trials suggestive of spontaneous retrieval, mouse trajectories initially went toward the typical ongoing-task response but turned mid-trajectory toward the PM response field on the opposite side of the computer screen. In nonfocal conditions, these trajectory reversals had a wider arc and took longer to complete, reflecting the likely greater retrospective retrieval requirements of nonfocal conditions. Regarding what are more likely to be strategic-monitoring processes, a significant portion of responses traveled directly to the PM response field, as though people were prepared to make such a response.","Spatial perspective taking: Effects of social, directional, and interactive cues.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30783909,Memory & cognition,2019 02 20,"Including an avatar in the array in a spatial perspective-taking test improves performance, but it is not clear why. Different aspects of an avatar, including its directional nature, its agency (perceived ability for action), and its interactivity, may all influence perspective-taking performance. Experiment 1 examined how performance was influenced by a social directional cue (an avatar) and an abstract directional cue (an arrow). Participants performed best in the avatar condition and no better in the arrow condition than in a control condition. These results suggest that directionality of the cue alone is not sufficient to facilitate performance on this task. Experiment 2 compared an avatar to a concrete directional cue that was grounded in everyday experience interacting with objects, but was non-agentive (a chair). There was no significant difference between the avatar and the chair conditions, which both outperformed the control condition. Participants in both experiments and all conditions primarily reported utilizing mental simulation strategies that involved imagining themselves in the array of objects. The results suggest that grounding the task in everyday interactions with people or objects facilitates this mental simulation process and more generally enhances performance on perspective-taking tasks.",Boundary conditions for the influence of spatial proximity on context-specific attentional settings.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30783908,"Attention, perception & psychophysics",2019 03 29,"Flexibility of cognitive control is illustrated by the context-specific proportion compatibility (CSPC) effect, the now well-documented pattern showing that compatibility effects are reduced in mostly incompatible relative to mostly compatible locations. The episodic-retrieval account attributes the CSPC effect to location-specific representations that include the attentional settings formed via experience within a given location (e.g., a ""focused"" attentional setting becomes bound to a location with frequent conflict, whereas a ""relaxed"" setting becomes bound to one with infrequent conflict). However, Diede and Bugg (Attention, Perception, & Psychophysics, 78, 1255-1266, 2016) demonstrated that the attentional setting associated with a given location can be based on experiences that accumulate across multiple ""grouped"" locations-namely, those that are proximal to each other, relative to other (distal) locations. This spatial grouping effect supported the relative-proximity hypothesis, which we further tested in the present study. Experiment 1 replicated the spatial grouping effect and showed that it could be disrupted by a horizontal line dividing the otherwise grouped locations. Experiments 2 through 4 suggested that grouping might be a form of ""chunking""-that is, the spatial grouping effect did not occur when the proximal locations were few enough in number (two) to represent independently, but it did occur when there were six locations. When there were eight proximal locations (and ten locations overall), the CSPC effect disappeared entirely. These findings suggest important boundary conditions for the relative-proximity hypothesis and inform our understanding of how past experiences with conflict are organized in the form of episodic representations that enable on-the-fly adjustments in cognitive control.",Intake of Heated Leaf Extract of Coriandrum sativum Contributes to Resistance to Oxidative Stress via Decreases in Heavy Metal Concentrations in the Kidney.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30783906,"Plant foods for human nutrition (Dordrecht, Netherlands)",2019 05 21,"Coriandrum sativum (coriander) is an annual herb of the Apiaceae family and has been used as a traditional remedy. Here we examined whether heated leaf extract of coriander decreases the concentrations of heavy metals in tissues. Male ddY mice were given a drinking water containing 0.25% of heated leaf extract of coriander for 8 weeks. Eight weeks after the intake, the concentrations of zinc, iron, copper, arsenic, and cadmium were measured in the liver and kidney. The intake of coriander did not modify the concentrations of all heavy metals tested in the liver, but decreased the concentrations of iron, arsenic, and cadmium in the kidney. Because heavy metals can induce oxidative stress, the effect of coriander intake on hydrogen peroxide-induced oxidative stress was compared between slices from the kidney and liver. The slices were immersed in Ringer solution containing 100 μM hydrogen peroxide and aminophenyl fluorescein (APF), a probe for detecting reactive oxygen species (ROS). APF fluorescence was markedly increased in the control kidney slices, while the increase was completely blocked in kidney slices from coriander intake group. In contrast, APF fluorescence was also markedly increased in the control liver slices, while the increase was not blocked by coriander intake. The present study indicates that intake of coriander leaf extract contributes to powerful resistance to oxidative stress in the kidney, probably via decreased concentrations in heavy metals. It is likely that decrease in arsenic concentration to the detection limit is a major factor for the resistance."

The results clearly revealed that co-culture of C. avellana cells and E. nigrum was more effective than elicitation of C. avellana cells by only cell extract or culture filtrate of this fungal strain. Co-culture of C. avellana cells and E. nigrum surpassed monocultures in terms of paclitaxel production designating their synergistic interaction potential. Fungal inoculum amount, co-culture establishment time and co-culture period were important factors for achieving the maximum production of paclitaxel in this co-culture system. The highest total yield of paclitaxel (404.5 µg L-1) was produced in co-culture established on 13th day using 3.2% (v/v) of E. nigrum mycelium suspension, which was about 5.5 and 136.6 times that in control cultures of C. avellana cells and E. nigrum, respectively. This is the first report on positive effect of co-culture of paclitaxel-producing endophytic fungus and non-host plant cells for enhancing paclitaxel production.",Current mentorship practices in the training of the next generation of clinical microbiology and infectious disease specialists: an international cross-sectional survey.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30783890,European journal of clinical microbiology & infectious diseases : official publication of the European Society of Clinical Microbiology,2019 04 07,"The purpose of this study was to describe the current practice of mentorship in clinical microbiology (CM) and infectious diseases (ID) training, to identify possible areas for improvement and to assess the factors that are associated with satisfactory mentorship. An international cross-sectional survey containing 35 questions was answered by 317 trainees or specialists who recently completed clinical training. Overall, 179/317 (56%) trainees were satisfied with their mentors, ranging from 7/9 (78%) in non-European countries, 39/53 (74%) in Northern Europe, 13/22 (59%) in Eastern Europe, 61/110 (56%) in Western Europe, 37/76 (49%) in South-Western Europe to 22/47 (47%) in South-Eastern Europe. However, only 115/317 (36%) respondents stated that they were assigned an official mentor during their training. In multivariable logistic regression analysis, the satisfaction of trainees was significantly associated with having a mentor who was a career model (OR 6.4, 95%CI 3.5-11.7), gave constructive feedback on work performance (OR 3.3, 95%CI 1.8-6.2), and knew the family structure of the mentee (OR 5.5, 95%CI 3.0-10.1). If trainees felt overburdened, 70/317 (22%) felt that they could not talk to their mentors. Moreover, 67/317 (21%) stated that they could not talk to their mentor when unfairly treated and 59/317 (19%) felt uncertain. Training boards and authorities responsible for developing and monitoring CM&ID training programmes should invest in the development of high-quality mentorship programmes for trainees in order to contribute to the careers of the next generation of professionals.",Campylobacter culture fails to correctly detect Campylobacter in 30% of positive patient stool specimens compared to non-cultural methods.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30783889,European journal of clinical microbiology & infectious diseases : official publication of the European Society of Clinical Microbiology,2019 06 10,"Campylobacter diagnosis is hampered because many laboratories continue to use traditional stool culture, which is slow and suffers false-negative results. This large multi-site study used a composite reference method consisting of a new FDA-cleared immunoassay and four molecular techniques to compare to culture. Prospectively collected patient fecal specimens (1552) were first preliminarily categorized as positive or negative by traditional culture. All specimens were also tested by EIA, and any EIA-positive or culture-discrepant results were further characterized by 16S rRNA qPCR, eight species-specific PCR assays, bidirectional sequencing, and an FDA-cleared multiplex PCR panel. The five non-culture methods showed complete agreement on all positive and discrepant specimens which were then assigned as true-positive or true-negative specimens. Among 47 true-positive specimens, culture incorrectly identified 13 (28%) as negative, and 1 true-negative specimen as positive, for a sensitivity of 72.3%. Unexpectedly, among the true-positive specimens, 4 (8%) were the pathogenic species C. upsaliensis. Culture had a 30% false result rate compared to immunoassay and molecular methods.

Recent development of this tool has allowed the performance of a transperineal prostate biopsy allowing pre-programmed standardized biopsy schemes. Prospective data collection was undertaken in 86 consecutive men who underwent robotically assisted transperineal prostate biopsy. All underwent a multi-parametric MRI pre-biopsy with centroid targeting followed by systematic template prostate biopsy. For the purposes of this study, our definition of clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa) is any Gleason score > 6. Mean (SD) age, median (IQR) PSA, and median (IQR) prostate volume were 64.24 (6.97) years, of 7.79 ng/ml (6.5) and 45.06 cc (28), respectively. Overall, 44 (51.2%) men were diagnosed with csPCa. csPCa was detected in the targeted biopsies alone in 35 (40.1%) men. The addition of the 12-zone template biopsy increased the yield of csPCa for another 9 (10.5%) men. Of these 9 men, the majority (7) harbored primary pattern 3 disease and only 1 was identified to have high-grade disease. Out of these 9 men, 7 of them had the identification of csPCa in the sector, where a target was contained within that zone. Robotic-assisted prostate biopsy in our study has demonstrated a high detection of csPCa when combined with limited near-field sampling. Our study suggests the use of more accurate biopsy schemes such as ring-targeting of lesions to mitigate against systematic and random mathematical errors.

Anti-malarial drug resistance is a global threat to control and eliminate malaria and therefore, it is very important to discover and evaluate new drug targets. The 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate cytidylyltransferase (IspD) homolog is a second in vivo target for fosmidomycin within isoprenoid biosynthesis in malarial parasites. In the present study, we have deciphered the sequence-structure-function integrity of IspD homologs based on their evolutionary imprints. The function and catalytic mechanism of them were also intensively studied by using sequence-structure homology, molecular modeling, and docking approach. Results of our study indicated that substrate-binding and dimer interface motifs in their structures were extensively conserved and part of them closely related to eubacterial origins. Amino acid substitutions in their coiled-coil regions found to bring a radical change in secondary structural elements, which in turn may change the local structural environment. Arg or Asp was identified as a catalytic site in plasmodium IspD homologs, contributing a direct role in the cytidylyltransferase activity similar to bacterial IspD. Results of molecular docking studies demonstrated how anti-malarial drugs such as fosmidomycin and FR-900098 have competitively interacted with the substrate-binding site of these homologs. As shown by our analysis, species-specific evolutionary imprints in these homologs determine the sequence-structure-function-virulence integrity and binding site alterations in order to confer anti-malarial drug resistance.",Feasibility of Brief Screening for At-Risk Gambling in Consumer Credit Counseling.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30783865,Journal of gambling studies,2019 02 20,"Gambling disorder and problem gambling often lead to major suffering in the form of mental health problems, interpersonal conflict, and financial crises. One potential setting for detecting at-risk gambling is credit counseling as gambling problems may manifest themselves in the form of financial distress and bankruptcy. Research studies have not considered those seeking credit counseling as individuals at risk for gambling problems even though gambling may contribute to financial distress. Therefore, the current study sought to quantify the prevalence of at-risk gambling in credit counseling compared with national estimates, to compare at-risk gamblers in this population to lower risk individuals, and to assess the feasibility of gambling screening in these settings. Using a mixed methods approach, the current study found that almost 20% of callers to a national agency reported gambling behavior, and among those who gambled, they reported higher rates of problems related to gambling than the broader U.S. population, thus supporting the idea that screening in credit counseling may help identify those at risk. Low risk gamblers were slightly younger than non-gamblers, but no other differences in sociodemographic and financial status variables were found based on gambling risk status. Results from focus groups and individual interviews suggest that credit counselors and program administrators see the benefit to brief screening within their intake and counseling processes. Our findings suggest that gambling screening is feasible in consumer credit counseling and may be acceptable to staff and administrators at these agencies.","Exosomes derived from mesenchymal stem cells inhibit mitochondrial dysfunction-induced apoptosis of chondrocytes via p38, ERK, and Akt pathways.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30783864,In vitro cellular & developmental biology. Animal,2019 06 14,"Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common chronic joint disease worldwide. Chondrocyte, as the only resident cell type in cartilage, its apoptosis is of pathogenetic significance in OA. Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-based-therapy has been proved effective in OA in animals and clinical studies. Nowadays, the regenerative potential of MSC-based therapy is mostly attributed to its paracrine secretion, in which exosomes may play an important role. In the present study, we aimed to find out the significance of MSC-derived exosomes (MSC-Exos) on the viability of chondrocytes under normal and inflammatory conditions. Bone marrow MSCs (BMSCs) and chondrocytes from rabbits were cultured in vitro. BMSC-Exos were isolated by an ultracentrifugation method. Transmission electron microscopy and Western blot were used to identify exosomes. The internalization of BMSC-Exos into chondrocytes was observed by fluorescent microscope. The viability and apoptosis of chondrocytes induced by IL-1β were tested through MTT method, Hoechst33324 dying, and mitochondrial damage measurement. Phosphorylation of p38, ERK, and Akt were evaluated by Western blot. The results showed that BMSC-Exos were round-shaped. Co-culturing BMSC-Exos with chondrocytes could observe the uptake of BMSC-Exos by chondrocytes. The viability decreased, apoptosis occurred, and the mitochondrial membrane potential of chondrocytes changed a lot when IL-1β were given, but all the changes were almost abolished when BMSC-Exos was added. Furthermore, the phosphorylation of p38 and ERK were inhibited, and phosphorylation of Akt was promoted by BMSC-Exos compared with IL-1β group. The present study demonstrated that BMSC-Exos inhibited mitochondrial-induced apoptosis in response to IL-1β, and p38, ERK, and Akt pathways were involved. BMSC-Exo might represent a novel cell-free therapeutic approach for the treatment of OA.",The clinical significance of a pathologically positive lymph node at the circumferential resection margin in rectal cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30783863,Techniques in coloproctology,2019 05 10,"This study aimed to determine if the nature of circumferential resection margin (CRM) involvement, either by tumour or lymph nodes, had an impact upon local recurrence and survival in rectal cancer.",Constructing a High-Density Genetic Linkage Map for Large Yellow Croaker (Larimichthys crocea) and Mapping Resistance Trait Against Ciliate Parasite Cryptocaryon irritans.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30783862,"Marine biotechnology (New York, N.Y.)",2019 04 06,"The large yellow croaker (Larimichthys crocea) is the most economically important marine cage-farming fish in China in the past decade. However, the sustainable development of large yellow croaker aquaculture has been severely hampered by several diseases, of which, the white spot disease caused by ciliate protozoan parasite Cryptocaryon irritans ranks the most damaging disease in large yellow croaker cage farms. To better understand the genetic basis of parasite infection and disease resistance to C. irritans, it is vital to map the traits and localize the underlying candidate genes in L. crocea genome. Here, we constructed a high-density genetic linkage map using double-digest restriction-site associated DNA (ddRAD)-based high-throughput SNP genotyping data of a F1 mapping family, which had been challenged with C. irritans for resistant trait measure. A total of 5261 SNPs was grouped and oriented into 24 linkage groups (LGs), representing 24 chromosomes of L. crocea. The total genetic map length was 1885.67 cM with an average inter-locus distance of 0.36 cM. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping identified seven significant QTLs in four LGs linked to C. irritans disease resistance. Candidate genes underlying disease resistance were identified from the reference genome, including ifnar1, ifngr2, ikbke, and CD112. Comparative genomic analysis between large yellow croaker and the four closely related species revealed high evolutionary conservation of chromosomes, though inter-chromosomal rearrangements do exist. Especially, the croaker genome structure was closer to the medaka genome than stickleback, indicating that the croaker genome might retain the teleost ancestral genome structure. The high-density genetic linkage map provides an important tool and resource for fine mapping, comparative genome analysis, and molecular selective breeding of large yellow croaker.",Using ecological niche models to describe the geographical distribution of the myiasis-causing Cochliomyia hominivorax (Diptera: Calliphoridae) in southern South America.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30783861,Parasitology research,2019 05 03,"In southern South America, namely Argentina and Chile, Cochliomyia hominivorax (Coquerel) is the main myiasic agent on humans and domestic animals. The distribution pattern of the species is poorly known and the southern limit of its geographic distribution is unclear. The aims of this study are to elucidate the basic environmental factors associated with occurrence of this myiasic species, evaluation of models constructed on the basis of occurrence data based on adult specimen records to predict geographic occurrence of myiasis, evaluation of unsurveyed sites of high potential of occurrence of the species, and recognition and prioritization of areas that need medical control and specific prophylaxis practices related to this pest. The maximum entropy modeling system (Maxent) was used. Maps of potential distribution of C. hominivorax were produced using two different datasets, models obtained with all localities known for the species (combining medical data and taxonomic data) and only-taxonomic models (excluding medical data). The results obtained include an updated compilation of occurrence of the species in Argentina and Chile. Predictive models obtained in this work indicated that large areas of central-eastern territory of Argentina has the potential for C. hominivorax occurrence, probably reaching the parallel 42° S as is indicated by the complete datasets. Only-taxonomic models fail to predict those myiasic cases occurring in the nearer areas of the Andean chains. The main variables associated with the distribution of C. hominivorax were, alternatively, isothermality or minimum temperature of the coldest month. These results provide a new analytical resource of high potential for the prevention of myiasis and to supports further epidemiological studies.",Isolation of viable Toxoplasma gondii from organs and Brazilian commercial meat cuts of experimentally infected pigs.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30783860,Parasitology research,2019 05 03,"The present study evaluated the distribution and viability of Toxoplasma gondii tissue cysts in the organs and Brazilian commercial cuts of experimentally infected pigs.

In 6-months-old SHR rats, perfusion in the brain tissue after cell transplantation considerably increased, while in 12-month-old rats it remained practically unchanged. We also observed marked activation of regulatory processes in the cerebral vascular system, most pronounced in 12-month-old rats. Neurogenic and myogenic tone of cerebral vessels increased significantly, while endothelium-dependent tone slightly decreased. The increase in neurogenic and myogenic tone of blood vessels in SHR rats at the age of 6 and 12 months after transplantation of stem cells can be explained by the formation of new smooth muscle cells in the pre-existing arteries walls. Greater muscle mass developed stronger force and contributed to narrowing of the arterial lumen, as a result, there was no increase in blood flow despite the downstream angiogenesis. A slight decrease in endothelium-dependent tone can be explained by increased production of vasodilators by newly formed endothelial cells.",Involvement of Actin Filaments in the Cytotoxic Effect of GD2-Specific Antibodies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30783840,Bulletin of experimental biology and medicine,2019 03 20,"Induction of direct cell death is one of the mechanisms of the antitumor effect of GD2-specific antibodies used for the therapy of high-risk neuroblastoma.

No expression of tissue factor was found in vimentin-positive decidual cells of the parietal endometrium. By contrast, intensive immunostaining of the TF/FVIIα complex was detected in the marginal layer of Rohr fibrinoid and less intense staining was found in vimentin-positive decidual cells adjacent to the walls of modified spiral arteries in the utero-placental region under conditions of invasion of the interstitial and intravascular cytotrophoblast (marker: cytokeratin-8). In the villi, tissue factor was expressed only in the fibrinoid lumps at sites of the syncytiotrophoblast defects. We demonstrated the formation of local hemostasis system in the uteroplacental region at weeks 5-8. This system creates optimal conditions for external thrombogenesis aimed at realization of the cytotrophoblast invasion and subsequent flow of arterial blood between the villi at the end of the first trimester.","Role of Muscarinic M1, M2, and M3 Receptors in the Regulation of Electrical Activity of Myocardial Tissue of Caval Veins during the Early Postnatal Ontogeny.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30783837,Bulletin of experimental biology and medicine,2019 03 20,"We studied the influence of blockers of muscarinic M1, M2, and M3 receptors on the effect of acetylcholine in the myocardial tissue of caval veins in rats at the early stage of ontogeny. The experiments were performed on isolated preparations of the right superior vena cava working under their own rhythm. Action potentials were recorded using the standard microelectrode technique. Acetylcholine (1 μM) suppressed automatic activity in the superior vena cava myocardium. Preliminary perfusion of the preparation with non-selective blocker atropine (1 μM) completely abolished the effect of acetylcholine, treatment with M2 receptor blocker AQ-RA 741 (1 μM) led to partial suppression of the effect of acetylcholine. Blockers of M1 and M3 receptors pirenzepine (1 μM) and 4DAMP (0.1 μM) did not suppress the effect of acetylcholine. Thus, the effect of acetylcholine is predominantly realized via M2 receptors, but M3 receptors can also partially mediate its effect in the superior vena cava myocardium in rats at the early stages of ontogeny.",Prognostic Risk Models for the Development of Cardiovascular Dysfunction in Adolescents with Essential Hypertension.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30783836,Bulletin of experimental biology and medicine,2019 03 20,"We present prognostic risk models for structural and functional cardiovascular disorders in Caucasian adolescents (Russians) with essential hypertension aged 14-17 years (15.92±1.12) taking into account biochemical (catecholamines and cortisol) and genetic parameters (carriage of polymorphic variants of α2A-adrenergic receptor gene ARA2A (-1291С>G), norepinephrine transporter NET (-1287G>A), and D2-dopamine receptor DRD2 (-141C Ins/Del) and the data of psychological testing.

In this study, the air quality and PM10 concentrations were evaluated around a railway station in Northeast India where trains are operated with diesel engines. The gaseous pollutant (e.g. SO2, NO2, and NH3) was collected and measured by using ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy. The advanced level characterizations of the PM10 samples were carried out by using ion chromatography, Fourier-transform infrared, X-ray diffraction, inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry , X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, field-emission scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive spectroscopy, and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy with energy-dispersive spectroscopy techniques to know their possible environmental contaminants. High-performance liquid chromatography technique was used to determine the concentration of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons to estimate the possible atmospheric pollution level caused by the rail traffic in the enclosure. The average PM10 concentration was found to be 262.11 µg m-3 (maximum 24 hour) which indicates poor air quality (AQI category) around the rail traffic.

In our study, we investigated the influence of basic numerical abilities on students' ability answer mathematical tasks with information presented in graphs. We analyzed data of 750 German students (grades 9-11) and evaluated the determinants of graph reading performance with multiple regression analysis using predictors of basic numerical abilities (such as number line estimation, basic arithmetic operations, etc.), considering also the influences of general cognitive ability, age, and gender. We found that number line estimation, subtraction, and conceptual knowledge were significant predictors of graph reading performance beyond the influences of general cognitive ability. This indicates that basic numerical abilities are still relevant for real-life problem solving in secondary school. We discuss possible mechanisms which directly (through respective arithmetic procedures) as well as indirectly (through mathematization of the problem) effectuate that basic numerical abilities graph reading performance.","Maternal and Paternal Depressive Symptoms, Home Learning Environment, and Children's Early Literacy.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30783812,Child psychiatry and human development,2019 02 20,"The present study examined the influence of mothers' and fathers' depressive symptoms on children's early literacy skills.

In this study, the microbial community was evaluated by 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and two associated bacterial isolates were obtained and characterized from the skin of O. grahami. Sixteen bacterial genera were identified from the O. grahami skin by uncultured clone sequences. The dominant groups were Comamonas, Bacillus and Morganella, and the genus Comamonas was the most abundant group (41.7% of the total) of the community. Fortunately, strains CW-25T and CW-518 belonging to genus Comamonas were isolated by plating dilutions.

The as-prepared materials were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), an X-ray diffractometer (XRD), and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). The photoelectrocatalytic activity of as-prepared materials was investigated with tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA) as the target analyte, and the data showed that PANI/CeO2/TiO2 NTAs resulted in much higher photoelectrocatalytic efficiency than that of other materials. Under optimal conditions, the degradation rate of TBBPA reached a maximum value over 96% in 120 min under simulated solar irradiation. The results indicated that CeO2 and PANI co-modified TiO2 NTAs could narrow the band gap, expand the response from ultraviolet (UV) to visible region, increase the amount of active free radicals, inhibit the recombination rate of electron-hole pairs, and finally enhance the degradation efficiency towards TBBPA owing to the presence of Ce3+/Ce4+ and PANI. Moreover, the degradation reaction followed the first-order kinetics, and degradation rates of the repeated experiments were all over 92% for ten runs. All these results indicated that this novel catalyst earned great potential as a powerful photoelectrocatalyst for the removal of TBBPA and other pollutants.","Effectiveness of intravenous dexamethasone, metoclopramide, ketorolac, and chlorpromazine for pain relief and prevention of recurrence in the migraine headache: a prospective double-blind randomized clinical trial.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30783794,Neurological sciences : official journal of the Italian Neurological Society and of the Italian Society of Clinical Neurophysiology,2019 06 13,"Dexamethasone, metoclopramide, ketorolac, and chlorpromazine have been used for the treatment of migraine headache.

In this study, the levels of lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd), arsenic (As), and mercury (Hg) in traditional animal medicines were monitored using inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS). Additionally, for the first time, a heavy metal risk assessment strategy was used to evaluate the potential risks of traditional animal medicines by calculating estimated daily intake (EDI), target hazard quotient (THQ), and cancer risk (CR). To obtain a refined risk assessment, the frequency of exposure to traditional animal medicines was determined from questionnaire data, and the safe factor for TCM was applied. Based on the standard levels for leech, it was found that earthworm, hive, scorpion, and leech accumulated high levels of heavy metals. The combined THQ (cTHQ) values indicated that ingestion of most traditional animal medicines would not pose a risk to the health of either male or female human beings. However, it was indicated that attention should be paid to the potential risk associated with cicada slough, earthworm, scorpion, turtle shells, and hive. Among heavy metals, As and Hg contributed to a major extent to the risk to human health. The CR assessment for Pb and As indicated that, with the exception of earthworm, the cancer risk was less than the acceptable lifetime risk for both males and females. Owing to the higher body weight, both THQ and CR were generally lower for males than for females.",Clinical purpura and elastosis and their correlation with skin tears in an aged population.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30783769,Archives of dermatological research,2019 03 14,"The previous research reported the results of a prospect cohort study that used logistic regression analysis to construct a risk prediction model for skin tears in individuals aged over 65 years. The model identified three baseline individual characteristics (male gender, history of STs, and history of falls) and two baseline skin manifestations (purpura and elastosis) that predicted the risk of dorsal forearm skin tears. This paper outlines the relationships between baseline skin manifestations and the risk of skin tears. Univariable logistic regression analysis was conducted of all the baseline data collected from the same-study participants to identify variables that significantly predicted purpura and elastosis at baseline. Amongst the 173 participants, 71 (41%) developed one or more skin tears, and in these participants, 52 (73.2%) displayed purpura, 41 (57.8%) had elastosis, and 30 (42.3%) exhibited both manifestations of the dorsal forearm at baseline. Four individual characteristics (age, history of skin tears, history of falls, and antiplatelet therapy) and three skin properties (pH, subepidermal low echogenicity band of the forearms, and skin thickness) were found to predict the risk of purpura. Conversely, three individual variables (age, gender, and smoking), three clinical skin variables (uneven skin pigmentation, cutis rhomboidalis nuchae, and history of actinic keratosis) and one skin property variable (collagen type IV) predicted the risk of skin elastosis. Progressive changes to the skin's structural and mechanical properties from the underlying effects of chronological ageing, and environmental and lifestyle-related influences increased the risk of purpura and elastotic skin manifestations and concomitantly increased risk of skin tears amongst participants.",Rutin and ascorbic acid cooperation in antioxidant and antiapoptotic effect on human skin keratinocytes and fibroblasts exposed to UVA and UVB radiation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30783768,Archives of dermatological research,2019 03 14,"The combination of ascorbic acid and rutin is frequently used in oral preparations.

The total antioxidant properties of both components, as well as their effect on cellular pro- and antioxidant status, lipid and protein oxidation, transmembrane transport, and pro-inflammatory and pro/antiapoptotic protein expression were measured. The combination of ascorbic acid and rutin had higher antioxidant properties compared to the activity of the single compound alone, and showed a stronger effect against UV-induced reactive oxygen species generation. The ascorbic acid and rutin combination also showed increased antioxidant enzyme activity (catalase, superoxide dismutase, thioredoxin reductase), which was impaired following UV irradiation. Moreover, ascorbic acid additional stimulated UV-induced bilitranslocase activity responsible for rutin transport, and therefore favored rutin effect on Nrf2 pathway, simultaneously differentiating the reaction of keratinocytes and fibroblasts. In keratinocytes, Nrf2 is strongly activated, while in fibroblasts decreased Nrf2 activity was observed. Used mixture, also significantly silenced UV-induced expression of pro-inflammatory factor NFκB and pro-apoptotic proteins such as caspases 3, 8, and 9. These results showed that ascorbic acid and rutin are complementary in their antioxidant actions, transport and signaling functions. Their combined antioxidant, antiinflammatory and antiapoptotic actions suggest rutin and ascorbic acid are a potentially cytoprotective team against UV-induced skin damage.",Activators of SIRT1 in wound repair: an animal model study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30783767,Archives of dermatological research,2019 03 14,"Caloric restriction (CR) and resveratrol activate SIRT1 and induce anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. We perform excisional lesion on the dorsum of four groups anesthetized animals: ad libitum-AL diet, AL diet with topical application of 2% resveratrol-Rv, 30% calorie restricted, and finally 30% calorie restricted with 2% resveratrol and we examine CR and Rv effects in wound repair. Restricted animals remained with CR for 31 days. The lesion was performed on day 18 of CR, and resveratrol application was started on day 19. Lesion samples were then collected on days 3 and 10 of treatment for structural, morphometric, and protein analyses. Our results showed that CR and Rv group as well as R group had enhanced numbers of blood vessels, VEGF, fibroblast, birefringent collagen fiber areas in the lesion. We conclude that effects in wound repair suggests that both CR and resveratrol may modulate angiogenesis, fibroplasia, and collagenesis, which could be ascribed to the action of SIRT1.","Citizen science sampling programs as a technique for monitoring microplastic pollution: results, lessons learned and recommendations for working with volunteers for monitoring plastic pollution in freshwater ecosystems.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30783766,Environmental monitoring and assessment,2019 04 09,"A citizen science microplastic monitoring method was developed to engage the public and quantify microplastic contamination at various sites along an approximately 550 km length of the Ottawa River from Lake Temiskaming to Hawkesbury, Ontario, Canada. The volunteers filtered 100 L of river water through a 100-μm mesh at their desired location along the Ottawa River. All but one of the river samples (n = 43) contained microplastics, with the vast majority of microplastics identified as microfibers. Microplastic concentrations ranged from 0.02 to 0.41 microplastic pieces per litre. We noted numerous advantages in working with citizen scientists including actively engaging citizens in the research, ease of recruiting volunteers within the established Ottawa Riverkeeper network, and expanded spatial coverage at minimal additional costs. Despite these important advantages, there are some important considerations with citizen scientist sampling including the rare events where volunteers mislabelled sample sheets (e.g. labelling as control instead of river sample) and the relatively low volume of water (100 L) that the volunteers could easily sample using our methodology. Recommendations for future citizen science projects for freshwater microplastic research include utilising an established and engaged network, running both field and lab control samples (blanks) to obtain estimates of contamination with microplastic fibres, and increasing the amount of water filtered to obtain more reliable estimates of microplastic pollution in our freshwater ecosystems.","Performance and microbial community profiles in pilot-scale biofilter for the simultaneous removal of ammonia, iron and manganese at different manganese concentrations.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30783765,Bioprocess and biosystems engineering,2019 04 27,"To accelerate extensive application of biological manganese removal technology, a pilot-scale biofilter for ammonia, iron and manganese removal was constructed to investigate the removal performance and microbial community profiles at different manganese concentrations.

Physicians are frequently exposed to adverse events. It makes them at risk for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and anxiety disorders. Besides the personal impact, physicians could pose a threat towards patients, as mental health problems are associated with medical errors. A questionnaire was sent to all members of the Pediatric Association of The Netherlands in October 2016. The questionnaire focused on adverse events, coping, and support. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and the Trauma Screening Questionnaire were included for evaluation of anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress. Four hundred ten questionnaires (18.9%) were eligible for analysis. Seventy-nine % (n = 325) of the respondents experienced adverse events, with ""missing a diagnosis"" having the most emotional impact and ""aggressive behavior"" as the most common adverse event. Nine (2.2%) pediatricians scored above the cut-off value on the Trauma Screening Questionnaire, indicative of PTSD. In total, 7.3% (n = 30) and 14.1% (n = 58) scored above the cut-off values in the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, indicative of depression and anxiety. Only 26.3% reported to have a peer support protocol available for emotional support following adverse events.Conclusion: Pediatricians experience a considerable amount of adverse and potentially traumatizing events associated with significantly higher mental health problems compared to the general high-income population. Aggression towards pediatricians seems to be a common problem. Protocolled (peer) support should be implemented. What is known: • Physicians are frequently exposed to adverse events. It makes physicians at risk for depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress. • Physicians who are affected by these events pose a threat towards patients, as mental health problems are associated with medical errors. What is new: • Pediatricians experience a considerable amount of adverse and potentially traumatizing events associated with significantly higher mental health problems. • It is advised that (peer) support after adverse events is protocolled and education on coping strategies is implemented, to improve mental well-being of pediatricians.",Comparison of microclimate measurements and perceptions as part of a global evaluation of environmental quality at neighbourhood scale.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30783761,International journal of biometeorology,2019 02 20,"The EUREQUA project raises the issue of the definition and evaluation of the environmental quality of neighbourhoods. The approach consists of integrating and cross-referencing observable data characterising the physical environment and people's perception of their quality of life. The study area is a neighbourhood in Toulouse (France) with high social and typo-morphological diversity, subject to noise and air pollution nuisances. Three 3-day field campaigns were organised in January, April, and June 2014. Instrumented and commented walks took place three times per day. For each one, measurements of physical environmental parameters and surveys were performed simultaneously at six locations in the neighbourhood. The study focuses on microclimate and thermal comfort issues. It aims to compare in situ meteorological data of air temperature, humidity, wind speed, and mean radiant temperature, with quantitative results rating human perception of heat, humidity, wind, and thermal comfort. The variability in perception and measurements is mainly driven by seasonal effects, especially for heat and humidity, and, to a lesser extent, for wind. Wind perception and measurement also vary spatially, thus highlighting site effects. Linear models indicate a positive link between heat perception and mean radiant temperature, as well as between wind perception and mean and standard deviation of wind speed (with a higher sensitivity of people to wind under winter climate conditions). Finally, it is found that perception of thermal comfort is only slightly linked to the different microclimate dimensions, and is rather driven by other appreciation factors and emotional criteria related to the general environmental quality of the study area."

Patients with hemifacial spasm (HFS) and healthy subjects (HS) acted as control subjects. Thirty patients with BSP, 20 patients with primary HFS and 20 age-matched healthy subjects were videotaped according to a standardized procedure: at rest with eyes open; while writing a standard sentence on paper; while writing a standard sentence on a blackboard keeping the head straight; during a conversation based on a simple topic (speaking task); and while reading a standard text aloud. Two independent movement disorders specialists reviewed the videotapes and measured the number of OO spasms and blinks in each segment. Writing and reading reduced the number of OO spasms in BSP patients, whereas speaking did not. On the other hand, writing, reading, and speaking did not modify spasms in HFS patients. These tasks modulated the blink rate in all the three groups of subjects (BSP, HFS, and HS). Our hypothesis is that the modulation of OO spasm in BSP during writing and reading depends on influences coming from occipital areas onto the brainstem circuits. Whether cognitive training with reading and writing may be used to improve OO muscle spasms is an issue that warrants further investigation.",,,,2019 04 19,,[Astigmatism].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30783746,Der Ophthalmologe : Zeitschrift der Deutschen Ophthalmologischen Gesellschaft,2019 03 10,"Astigmatism is the most frequent refractive error worldwide followed by hyperopia and myopia.

For various models of dispersal, including reaction-advection-diffusion models in continuously varying environments, it has been shown by pairwise invasibility analysis that dispersal strategies which generate an ideal free distribution are evolutionarily steady strategies (ESS, also known as evolutionarily stable strategies) and are neighborhood invader strategies (NIS). That is, populations using such strategies can both invade and resist invasion by populations using strategies that do not produce an ideal free distribution. (The ideal free distribution arises from the assumption that organisms inhabiting heterogeneous environments should move to maximize their fitness, which allows a mathematical characterization in terms of fitness equalization.) Classical reaction diffusion models assume that landscapes vary continuously. Landscape ecologists consider landscapes as mosaics of patches where individuals can make movement decisions at sharp interfaces between patches of different quality. We use a recent formulation of reaction-diffusion systems in patchy landscapes to study dispersal strategies by using methods inspired by evolutionary game theory and adaptive dynamics. Specifically, we use a version of pairwise invasibility analysis to show that in patchy environments, the behavioral strategy for movement at boundaries between different patch types that generates an ideal free distribution is both globally evolutionarily steady (ESS) and is a global neighborhood invader strategy (NIS).",A reference high-density genetic map of greater yam (Dioscorea alata L.).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30783744,TAG.

Greater yam (Dioscorea alata L.) is a major staple food in tropical and subtropical areas. This study aimed to produce the first reference genetic map of this dioecious species using genotyping-by-sequencing. In this high-density map combining information of two F1 outcrossed populations, 20 linkage groups were resolved as expected and 1579 polymorphic markers were ordered. The consensus map length was 2613.5 cM with an average SNP interval of 1.68 cM. An XX/XY sex determination system was identified on LG6 via the study of sex ratio, homology of parental linkage groups and the identification of a major QTL for sex determination. Homology with the sequenced D. rotundata is described, and the median physical distance between SNPs was estimated at 139.1 kb. The effects of segregation distortion and the presence of heteromorphic sex chromosomes are discussed. This D. alata linkage map associated with the available genomic resources will facilitate quantitative trait mapping, marker-assisted selection and evolutionary studies in the important yet scarcely studied yam species.",Assessment of strut coverage of everolimus-eluting platinum chromium stent 2 weeks after implantation by optical coherence tomography.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30783743,Heart and vessels,2019 02 20,"The SYNERGY coronary stent is new-generation drug-eluting stents, which has a thin-strut platinum-chromium platform with everolimus in a biodegradable polymer applied to the abluminal surface.

The present study investigated the degree of strut coverage using optical coherence tomography (OCT) 2 weeks after SYNERGY implantation and clinical factors contributing to strut coverage. A total of 29 patients who underwent staged percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to residual lesions 2 weeks after the index PCI with SYNERGY stent implantation were enrolled. At the time of staged PCI, OCT examinations of the SYNERGY stent were performed for conventional OCT analysis on both cross-sectional and strut level. SYNERGY stent showed a high level of strut coverage and apposition, and the percentage was 82.4 ± 12.4% and 96.2 ± 5.0%, respectively. The lesion complexity was significantly related to greater strut coverage on univariate analysis; however, it was found to be insignificant in multivariate analysis.

Autophagy is a fundamental cellular degradation and recycling pathway, which has attracted substantial attention because defects in this process are associated with a wide range of human disorders including cancer, neurodegeneration, and metabolic diseases. Autophagy must be tightly controlled-either too much or too little can be deleterious. Therefore, understanding the complex regulation of autophagy is critical to achieve the goal of modulating the process for therapeutic purposes. Autophagy occurs constitutively, but is upregulated in response to stress. Here, we highlight a role for various RBPs in regulating particular autophagy-related (ATG) mRNAs. We briefly summarize recent publications, which focus on the RBPs Dhh1, Pat1, Lsm1-Lsm7 and Dcp2 in the post-transcriptional regulation of certain mRNAs that encode key components of the autophagy machinery. Finally, we consider how the established role of these and other RBPs in enhancing decapping and downregulating mRNAs is not their only function when it comes to regulating stress-related transcripts. Most ATG genes are downregulated during growth, in contrast to the vast majority of the genome; we discuss how certain regulatory factors play a key role in maintaining autophagy at a basal level during growth, while allowing for a rapid increase when cells encounter various stress conditions.",Mdivi-1 and mitochondrial fission: recent insights from fungal pathogens.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30783741,Current genetics,2019 02 20,"Mitochondrial fission shows potential as a therapeutic target in non-infectious human diseases. The compound mdivi-1 was identified as a mitochondrial fission inhibitor that acts against the evolutionarily conserved mitochondrial fission GTPase Dnm1/Drp1, and shows promising data in pre-clinical models of human pathologies. Two recent studies, however, found no evidence that mdivi-1 acts as a mitochondrial fission inhibitor and proposed other mechanisms. In mammalian cells, Bordt et al. showed that mdivi-1 inhibits complex I in mitochondria (Dev Cell 40:583, 2017). In a second study, we have recently demonstrated that mdivi-1 does not trigger a mitochondrial morphology change in the human yeast pathogen Candida albicans, but impacts on endogenous nitric oxide (NO) levels and inhibits the key virulence property of hyphal formation (Koch et al., Cell Rep 25:2244, 2018). Here we discuss recent insights into mdivi-1's action in pathogenic fungi and the potential and challenges for repurposing it as an anti-infective.

Numerous categories of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) have been developed and widely used to evaluate herd immunity. Manufacturing inactivated FMD virus (FMDV) as a diagnostic antigen requires a facility with a high level of biosafety, but this requirement raises concern on viral leakage. In our previous study, bacterium-original FMD virus-like particles (VLPs) resemble the authentic FMDV and induce protective immunity against homologous viral challenges, thereby demonstrating that they are sufficiently safe without limitations on biosafety facilities and easily prepared. Herein, we developed a competitive ELISA (cELISA) based on FMDV-VLPs as a diagnostic antigen to evaluate herd immunity. The criterion of this cELISA was determined by detecting panels of positive sera with different antibody titers and negative sera. The working parameter of cELISA was optimized, and samples with a percentage inhibition of ≥ 50% were considered positive. The specificity of cELISA to test 277 serum samples with various antibody titers was 100%, and the sensitivity reached 96%. The coincidence rates of cELISA with a VDPro® FMDV and a PrioCHECK® FMDV type O antibody ELISA kit were 97.8% and 98.2%, respectively. Repeatability tests demonstrated that the coefficients of variation within and between runs were less than 7% and 14%, respectively. Our data demonstrated that cELISA based on bacterium-original VLPs had high specificity, sensitivity, and reproducibility.

The role of mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) in testosterone-induced cardiac dysfunction has not been fully elucidated. The study was therefore designed to investigate the role of MR on gestational excess androgen-induced cardiac disrupted glutathione-dependent antioxidant system and elevated endoglin (Eng) linking it with pregnancy outcomes. Thirty-two pregnant Wistar rats were randomly allotted into four groups (n = 8/group) receiving (sc) olive oil, testosterone propionate (0.5 mg/kg) singly or in combination with non-selective MR blocker (MRB), spironolactone (0.25 mg/kg; po) or selective MRB, and eplerenone (1.0 mg/kg; po) in late between gestational days 14 and 19. The results showed that testosterone exposure resulted in elevated fasting blood glucose, increased cardiac mass, free fatty acid, endoglin, malonaldehyde, oxidized glutathione, uric acid, and lactate production and cardiac injury marker enzymes. On the other hand, testosterone exposure caused reduction in cardiac adenosine, nitric oxide, glutathione, glutathione peroxidase, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activities. However, MR blockade by spironolactone and or eplerenone attenuated the effects induced by testosterone exposure.

The possible involvement of serotonergic system in the effects of the new compounds in the FST through pharmacological antagonists/modulators of serotonergic transmission was also investigated. Compounds 4p and 3o were shown to possess antidepressant activity in both tests, FST and TST. The antidepressant-like effects of the new compounds in the FST were prevented by pretreatment of mice with pCPA (serotonin depletor), (-)pindolol (mixed 5-HT1A/1B and β-adrenergic antagonist), and WAY 100635 (selective 5-HT1A antagonist). Additionally, in drug interaction studies, the 5-HT2A/2C antagonist, ketanserin, and the classic antidepressant, imipramine, potentiated antidepressant-like effect of both new compounds. The obtained results demonstrate that the new compounds 4p and 3o produce an antidepressant-like effect in mice which seems to be mediated by interaction with the serotonin 5-HT1A receptors and in the case of 4p, also with the 5-HT2C receptors.","Single finger movements in the aging hand: changes in finger independence, muscle activation patterns and tendon displacement in older adults.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30783716,Experimental brain research,2019 06 12,"With aging, hand mobility and manual dexterity decline, even under healthy circumstances. To assess how aging affects finger movement control, we compared elderly and young subjects with respect to (1) finger movement independence, (2) neural control of extrinsic finger muscles and (3) finger tendon displacements during single finger flexion. In twelve healthy older (age 68-84) and nine young (age 22-29) subjects, finger kinematics were measured to assess finger movement enslaving and the range of independent finger movement. Muscle activation was assessed using a multi-channel electrode grid placed over the flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS) and the extensor digitorum (ED). FDS tendon displacements of the index, middle and ring fingers were measured using ultrasound. In older subjects compared to the younger subjects, we found: (1) increased enslaving of the middle finger during index finger flexion (young: 25.6 ± 12.4%, elderly: 47.0 ± 25.1%; p = 0.018), (2) a lower range of independent movement of the index finger (youngmiddle = 74.0%, elderlymiddle: 45.9%; p < 0.001), (3) a more evenly distributed muscle activation pattern over the finger-specific FDS and ED muscle regions and (4) a lower slope at the beginning of the finger movement to tendon displacement relationship, presenting a distinct period with little to no tendon displacement. Our study indicates that primarily the movement independence of the index finger is affected by aging. This can partly be attributed to a muscle activation pattern that is more evenly distributed over the finger-specific FDS and ED muscle regions in the elderly."

Investigation of all fragility fracture patients above the age of 50 years is recommended in order to prevent further fractures. The aim of this study was to investigate alternative strategies including known risk factors (age, sex, and body weight) for selecting fracture patients for osteoporosis assessment and investigate how these strategies would affect the proportion of patients with osteoporosis identified and the number of patients referred for Dual X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) compared with the original FLS strategy. From OFELIA; a cohort study comprising 794 fragility fracture patients we included 622 patients aged 18 + years (mean age 56 ± 17) with fragility fractures. We investigated the predictive value of clinical risk factors using ROC curves and AUC analyses. The revised strategies were compared by analyzing sensitivity and specificity of different strategies based on sex, age, BMI, and bodyweight. For patients 50 + years, a strategy investigating men and women with body weight ≤ 85 kg resulted in sensitivity and specificity of 94% and 25%, respectively, reducing the number of DXAs by 21%. For patients < 50 years, the prevalence of osteoporosis was low and it was, therefore, difficult to develop an acceptable strategy. We found that the original FLS strategy can be modified to include substantially fewer patients and still only miss the osteoporosis diagnosis in a very few patients.

Based on new source material, we show in this paper that the interest in prenatal diagnosis also arose within the context of research on mutagenicity (the capacity to induce mutations) that was concerned with environmental dangers to human health. Our analysis of the debates around the establishment of the German Research Foundation's (DFG) research program ""Prenatal Diagnosis of Genetic Defects"" reveals that amniocentesis was introduced in Western Germany by a group of scientists working on the dangers for the human organism caused by radiation, pharmaceuticals, and other substances and consumer goods. We argue that, in a period of growing environmental concern, the support of prenatal diagnosis aimed to close a perceived gap in the prevention of environmental mutagenicity, i. e. genetic anomalies induced by environmental factors. The expected financing of prenatal diagnosis by health insurance in the course of the reform of abortion rights was used as another argument for the new technology's introduction as a ""defensive measure"". Only in a second step did changes in research structures, but most importantly experience from gynecological practice lead to a reframing of the technology as a tool for the diagnosis and prevention of mostly genetic or spontaneously occurring anomalies. Eventually, prenatal diagnosis, as it became routinely used in Western Germany from the early 1980s onward, had little to do with ""environmental"" questions. This case study of the early history of genetic prenatal diagnosis analyzes the still poorly researched relationship between research in human genetics, environmental research and medical practice. Furthermore, we aim to shed new light on a shift in perspective in prevention around 1970 that has so far been described in different contexts.",A study of Love wave acoustic biosensors monitoring the adhesion process of tendon stem cells (TSCs).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30783690,European biophysics journal : EBJ,2019 06 13,"The Love wave biosensor is considered to be one of the most promising probing methods in biomedical research and diagnosis, and has been applied to detect the mechano-biological behaviour of cells attached to the surface of the device. More efforts should be devoted to basic theoretical research and relevant device performance analysis that may contribute to the further developments of Love wave sensors. In this study, a 36º YX-LiTaO3-based Love wave sensor with a parylene-C wave guiding layer was adopted as a cell-based biosensor to monitor the adhesion process of tendon stem/progenitor cells (TSCs), a newly discovered cell type in tendons. A theoretical model is proposed to describe the Love wave propagation, in which the adherent cells are considered as a uniform viscoelastic layer. The effects of viscoelastic cell layer and wave guiding layer on the propagation velocity υ and propagation loss (PL) are investigated. The numerical results indicate that adherent cell layers of different storage or loss shear modulus in certain ranges can induce pronounced and characteristic variations in υ and PL, revealing the potential of Love wave sensors to provide useful quantitative measures on cellular mechanical properties. The sensor response to the adhesion of TSCs exhibits high consistency with experimental observations, which demonstrates the Love wave biosensor as a very promising sensor platform for investigating cellular activities under multiple physiological conditions."

Here, we show the crystal structure of the DNA binding domain of OsWRKY45 (OsWRKY45-DBD, i.e. the WRKY and zinc finger domain) in complex with a W-box DNA. Surprisingly, two OsWRKY45-DBD molecules exchange β4-β5 strands to form a dimer. The domain swapping occurs at the hinge region between the β3 and β4 strands, and is bridged and stabilized by zinc ion via coordinating residues from different chains. The dimer contains two identical DNA binding domains that interact with the major groove of W-box DNA. In addition to hydrophobic and direct hydrogen bonds, water mediated hydrogen bonds are also involved in base-specific interaction between protein and DNA. Finally, we discussed the cause and consequence of domain swapping of OsWRKY45-DBD, and based on our work and that of previous studies present a detailed mechanism of W-box recognition by WRKY TFs. This work reveals a novel dimerization and DNA-binding mode of WRKY TFs, and an intricate picture of the WRKY/W-box DNA recognition.",Moderation of the association between chronic medical conditions and functional limitations over time by physical activity: Effects of age.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30783672,"The journals of gerontology.

In this context, transcription factors, which either singularly or in conjugation directly control the expression of many target genes, are suitable candidates for improving agronomic traits via genetic engineering. In this regard, members of one of the largest class of plant-specific APETALA2/Ethylene Response Factor (AP2/ERF) superfamily, which is implicated in various aspects of development and plant stress adaptation responses, are considered high-value targets for crop improvement. Besides their long-known regulatory roles in mediating plant responses to abiotic stresses such as drought and submergence, the novel roles of AP2/ERFs during fruit ripening or secondary metabolites production have also recently emerged. The astounding functional plasticity of AP2/ERF members is considered to be achieved by their interplay with other regulatory networks and signalling pathways. In this review, we have integrated the recently accumulated evidence from functional genomics studies and described their newly emerged functions in plants. The key structural features of AP2/ERF proteins and the modes of their action are briefly summarized. The importance of AP2/ERFs in plant development and stress responses and a summary of the event of their successful applications in crop improvement programs are also provided. Altogether, we envisage that the synthesized information presented in this review will be useful to design effective strategies for improving agronomic traits in crop plants.","Outbreak of respiratory illness associated with human adenovirus type 7 among persons attending Officer Candidates School, Quantico, Virginia, 2017.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30783668,The Journal of infectious diseases,2019 02 20,"A respiratory outbreak associated with adenovirus-7 (HAdV-7) occurred among unvaccinated officer candidates attending initial military training.

Divergent thinking in older adults, compared to young adults, was associated with functional connectivity between the default and both executive control networks (FPN and SN) as well as more widespread default-executive coupling. Finally, the ventromedial prefrontal cortex appears to be a critical node involved in within- and between-network connectivity associated with creative cognition in older adulthood.
