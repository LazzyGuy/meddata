Although new memory formation is typically studied in a laboratory setting, most real-world associations are modifications to existing memories, particularly in the aging, experienced brain. To date, the field has lacked a simple behavioral paradigm that can measure whether original and updated information is remembered in a single test session. To address this gap, we have developed a novel memory updating paradigm, called the Objects in Updated Locations (OUL) task that is capable of assessing memory updating in a non-stressful task that is appropriate for both young and old rodents. We first show that young mice successfully remember both the original memory and the updated information in OUL. Next, we demonstrate that intrahippocampal infusion of the protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin disrupts both the updated information and the original memory at test, suggesting that memory updating in OUL engages the original memory. To verify this, we used the Arc CatFISH technique to show that the OUL update session reactivates a largely overlapping set of neurons as the original memory. Finally, using OUL, we show that memory updating is impaired in aging, 18-m.o. mice. Together, these results demonstrate that hippocampal memory updating is impaired with aging and establish that the OUL paradigm is an effective, sensitive method of assessing memory updating in rodents.","Hepatoprotective, Antihyperlipidemic and Radical Scavenging Activity of Hawthorn (Crataegus oxyacantha) and Rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis) on Alcoholic Liver Disease.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31202212,Alternative therapies in health and medicine,2019 06 15,"Alcohol catabolism produces oxidative stress, causing cell death and inflammation in liver tissue principally. Hawthorn (Crataegus oxyacantha) and Rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis) are medicinal plants that have shown a potent antioxidant activity related with anti-inflammatory properties. The objective of this study was the evaluation of Hawthorn and Rosemary methanol extracts as preventive treatment in alcoholic liver disease (ALD). ALD rat model was used to measure serum hepatic enzyme levels (AST, ALT, γ-GT and ACP), total bilirubin, liver glycogen, lipid peroxidation, total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and serum lipid profile (total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL and HDL) as well as histopathological analysis in hepatic tissues was recorder. Phytotreatments showed preventive effect, decreasing AST, γ-GT, lipid peroxidation and bilirubin indictors while TAC and liver glycogen stores increase. Interestingly, Rosemary diminished the levels of ALT and ACP. Remarkable both treatments show liver tissue damage reduction. Hawthorn proved antihyperlipidemic effect, eviting increase in all lipid indicators, while Rosemary showed antihyperlipidemic effect only in LDL levels without affecting HDL levels. The results indicate that Hawthorn and Rosemary treatments have different mechanisms of action; however they show hepatoprotective effect against ALD in rat model. Hawthorn and Rosemary could be used to prevent or help in the treatment of ALD.","Multicenter, Prospective, Controlled Double-Blind Study Comparing Fib-19-01, A Phytotherapy Treatment, To A Dietary Supplement And To Conventional Care In Patients Suffering From Fibromyalgia.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31202211,Alternative therapies in health and medicine,2019 06 15,Current therapeutic modalities for fibromyalgia (FM) do not provide satisfactory results and new approaches have to be explored.,Manual Therapy With Cryotherapy Versus Kinesiotherapy With Cryotherapy for Knee Osteoarthritis: A Randomized Controlled Trial.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31202210,Alternative therapies in health and medicine,2019 06 15,"Manual therapy and kinesiotherapy are used for knee osteoarthritis (OA).

Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) was exposed to 200 mM NaCl for 30 d in hydroponics, with or without 2 mM Si. X-ray microanalysis coupled with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to quantify the cell-specific ion profiles across root and leaf cells, paralleled by measurements of wheat growth and physiological responses. Under salt stress, higher Na+ and Cl- concentrations were detected in root epidermal, cortical and stelar cells, eventually increasing their concentrations in different leaf cells, being highest in the epidermal cells and lowest in the vascular bundle cells. The potassium (K+) and magnesium (Mg2+) profiles were generally opposite to those of Na+ and Cl-. NaCl-dependent deregulation of essential nutrient homeostasis and excessive toxic ions accumulation in leaves was correlated with enhanced electrolyte leakage index (ELI), decreased chlorophyll contents, photosynthesis and other physiological parameters, and ultimately hampered plant growth. Conversely, Si addition improved the growth and physiological performance of salinized wheat by reducing Na+ and Cl- concentration in root epidermal and cortical cells, and it improved root uptake and storage of K+ and Mg2+ ions and their loading into xylem for distribution to shoots. These results suggest that Si-mediated inhibition of Na+ uptake, maintained nutrient homeostasis and improved physiological parameters to contribute to wheat growth improvement under salt stress.","Transcriptome analysis reveals novel insights into the continuous cropping induced response in Codonopsis tangshen, a medicinal herb.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31202192,Plant physiology and biochemistry : PPB,2019 06 15,"Codonopsis tangshen Oliv.

Transcriptome profiling found 762 differentially expressed genes, including 430 up-regulated and 332 down-regulated genes by C-cro. In addition, pathway enrichment analysis revealed that genes related to 'Tyrosine degradation I', 'Glycogen synthesis' and 'Phenylalanine and tyrosine catabolism' were up-regulated, and genes associated with 'Signal transduction', 'Immune system', etc. were down-regulated by C-cro. The expression of target genes was further validated by Q-PCR.

To perform affinity chromatography for evaluating DNA amplicons, avidin-conjugated MPs and succinimide-linked sepharose were used with biotin-primers. To mimic the centrifugal-based affinity ligand chromatography, a smartphone-mountable low-power fan was plugged into the charging port of a smartphone. The charging port stably emitted electric current at 3.0 V, and the fan blades were modified for use as a portable rotor. Based on the binding variation of MPs with DNA amplicons, the position of MPs in sepharose changed significantly during centrifugation. The change in distance was optically analyzed using the illumination sensor of the smartphone with respect to the altered transmittance due to the MPs. Amplified genes from Escherichia. coli O157:H7 samples ranging from 1.0 × 101 to 1.0 × 106 colony-forming units could be rapidly and immediately detected by the naked eye using a simple smartphone-based optical device.

The application of cylindrical single-chamber microbial fuel cell gives full play to the role of anode carbon brush and increases contact with surrounding oxygen by enlarging the surface area of the cathode. Both cylindrical design and P. aeruginosa inoculation in anode have positive effects on power output of microbial fuel cells. Changing the configuration from cubic to cylindrical resulted in a substantial reduction in internal resistance from 127.21 Ω to 49.66 Ω. Meanwhile, the cylindrical microbial fuel cell inoculated with mixed anaerobic bacteria exhibits power overshoot, and the dissolved oxygen in the electrolyte is raised. Thus, we also select P. aeruginosa inoculation in cylindrical reactor, where the maximum power density is increased to 3322 ± 38 mW m-2 and internal resistance is reduced to 34.0 ± 1.1 Ω, and then power overshoot is improved. Thus, P. aeruginosa showed better electrogenic performance than anaerobic mixtures.

They have 3-dimensional protrusions that have large surface areas to accommodate a large number of membrane proteins such as ion channels and G-protein coupled receptors, resulting in high sensitivity and specificity to target molecules. From the perspective of mimicking this system, BLM, which has been used extensively as a platform for a single nanopore-based sensing systems, has some limitations, i.e., some residual solvent, low mechanical stability, small surface area for appropriate stability, and difficulty in high-throughput fabrication. Herein, to eliminate these limitations, a solvent-free, size-controllable, 3-dimensional free-standing lipid bilayer (3DFLB) structure array with high stability (∼130 h) and high density (∼300,000 cm-2) is proposed, and its structural advantages for efficient and rapid protein reconstitution, compared to BLM, is demonstrated by human 5-HT3A receptor assay as well as α-hemolysin assay.

A distortion in energy spectrum and degradation in timing resolution take place when pulse pile-up occurs. This in turn leads to degradations of the signals used in applications such as nuclear medicine. Pile-up pulses are commonly removed in most algorithms if they are detected, but in this case, getting a clean spectrum becomes a challenge due to data loss. A proposed pile-up detection and recovery algorithm based on fitting the preamplifier data and signal extrapolation is presented. The extrapolated pulse is used for recovering (extracting) the piled-up pulse to estimate its parameters. A smoothed first derivative algorithm is used for peak tracking inside the detected events. To evaluate the proposed pile-up recovery algorithm theoretically and experimentally, it is applied on both simulated input signals generated with different time displacements between the piled-up events, and experimental preamplifier radiation signals. The obtained results prove that the proposed algorithm achieves better utilization of power and can be used for high count rate (high activity elements) spectroscopy systems.",Application of 252Cf neutron source for precise nuclear data experiments.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31202184,"Applied radiation and isotopes : including data, instrumentation and methods for use in agriculture, industry and medicine",2019 06 15,"Purpose of this paper is to provide extensive information helpful for anyone performing any experiment involving 252Cf neutron source and aiming for high precision experiments.

Furthermore, we prove that our source is volumetric, i.e. non-point and can be considered as an isotropic in our experimental settings. Influence of the palladium matrix density on the reaction rates is also investigated. Concerning nuclear data, we are measuring fast neutron leakage spectra in various benchmark sets including spheres of different materials. Our work extends benchmark sets to possible use of cubes, in our case graphite cube of side 30 cm. The neutron spectra are measured by stilbene scintilation detector in the energy range of 1-10 MeV in the steps of 100 keV in the distance of 100 cm from the centre of the cube. There is no significant difference between measurements performed using cube or sphere except lower cost for the cube production. The agreement between calculation using ENDF/B-VII.1 library and experimental data is not satisfactory especially in the regions around 3.5 MeV and 8 MeV. The agreement within 4% of calculation to experiment ratio for neutron leakage fluxes of pure 252Cf source validates our MCNP model for studying reaction rates and leakage fluxes in the region above 1 MeV."

FLuo-3 AM labeling showed that the Ca2+ concentration in cells increased under hypoxia condition. shRNA-ASIC3 and ASIC3 expression vector were transfected into cells. Subsequently, cells were divided into six groups: Control, 2% O2, shRNA-NC+2% O2, shRNA-ASIC3 + 2% O2, Vector+2% O2 and ASIC3 + 2% O2. Flow cytometry, CCK-8 assay, transmission electron microscopy, immunofluorescent labeling, RT-PCR and western blot demonstrated that hypoxia and ASIC3 over-expression inhibited the proliferation, arrested cell cycle in G1 phase, promoted the apoptosis, initiated the autophagy and up-regulated the expression of ASIC3, HIF-1α, light chain 3, p-ERK1/2 and p-MAPK. However, ASIC3 silencing could significantly relieve these phenomena. Co-immunoprecipitation assay found ASIC3 was interacted with HIF-1α&ERK1/2. Evaluation of the effect of HIF-1αsilencing on ASIC3 expression showed that the high expression of ASIC3 induced by hypoxia was reduced significantly by HIF-1α silencing. In conclusion, hypoxia and ASIC3 changed the behavior of nucleus pulposus cells by activating the MAPK pathway.

The Ik6+ Ph+ -ALL cell lines Sup-B15 or BV173 were treated with Huaier extract, imatinib or the combination of the two. Analysis of cell proliferation showed that the combined treatment of imatinib and Huaier extract exhibited a greater effect on cell inhibition. Using flow cytometry and Western blot, enhanced effects on the induction of cell apoptosis were observed. The combination of the two drugs also exhibited a significant effect in decreasing the protein and enzymatic activity levels of BCR-ABL. The molecular mechanisms may be involved in BCR-ABL related pathways, including the inactivation of p-AKT, p-STAT5, p-mTOR and p-Lyn. Consistent with the in vitro results, the combination of Huaier extract and imatinib inhibit the growth and infiltration of xenografted tumors.

The frequency of HLA-C*03:02 was 6.7% (5/75) in the MMI-DILI case patients and 6.4% (4/62) in MMI-induced cholestatic/mixed liver damage, which were significantly different from the percentage of 0.4% (1/231) in the MMI-tolerant patients (odds ratio (OR) = 15.4, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.77-133.9, adjusted P = 0.0292; OR=14.9, 95% CI=2.38-182.9, adjusted P = 0.0323; respectively). HLA-A*02:01 was also found to be associated with MMI-induced cholestatic/mixed liver injury (OR = 3.13, 95%CI=1.45-6.91, adjusted P = 0.0464). The present study demonstrated that individuals carrying HLA-C*03:02 allele are at increased risk of developing MMI-induced DILI. These results may assist doctors to prevent the occurrence of hepatotoxicity in GD patients receiving MMI.",Long non-coding RNA CRNDE enhances cervical cancer progression by suppressing PUMA expression.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31202167,Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,2019 06 15,"Cervical cancer is the second most common gynecological malignancy, and it remains a leading cause of tumor-related death among female in the world. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been indicated to play essential roles in tumorigenesis, and the lncRNA colorectal neoplasia differentially expressed (CRNDE) is increased in several tumors. Nevertheless, little is known about the effects of lncRNA CRNDE on human cervical cancer. The aim of the study was to explore the clinical significance of lncRNA CRNDE expression in human cervical cancer. Our results indicated that CRNDE expression was increased in cervical cancer tissues and several cervical cancer cell lines. Through loss-of-function and gain-of-function approaches, we found that CRNDE knockdown markedly reduced cervical cancer cell proliferation, while CRNDE overexpression significantly promoted cervical cancer cell growth. Consistently, CRNDE decreasing obviously inhibited tumorigenicity of cervical cancer cells in vivo, whereas CRNDE increasing markedly promoted cervical cancer progression. Mechanistically, we verified that CRNDE bond to p53 upregulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA), and PUMA was required for CRNDE to enhance cervical cancer cell growth. Our study demonstrated that CRNDE, combined with PUMA, could be utilized as factor for the clinical diagnosis and prognosis of cervical cancer, and might be potential target for developing effective therapeutic strategy to prevent cervical cancer progression.",Tamoxifen affects the histology and hepatopancreatic lipid metabolism of swimming crab Portunus trituberculatus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31202166,"Aquatic toxicology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",2019 06 15,"Tamoxifen (TAM) is an antiestrogenic agent and can enter the aquatic environment in wastewater. It has been reported that TAM can induce hepatic steatosis in vertebrates, however, the effects of TAM exposure on lipid metabolism of hepatopancreas in crustaceans remains unclear. In this study, four TAM concentrations (0, 6.7, 13.4 and 20 μg g-1 crab body weight) were injected into the swimming-leg of swimming crabs Portunus trituberculatus, as a means of evaluating the effects of TAM on the expression levels of lipid metabolism-related genes, lipid composition, and hepatopancreas histology. The results showed that the mRNA levels of three lipogenic related genes (diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 (DGAT1), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) and fatty acyl desaturase (FAD)) decreased significantly in the 6.7 μg g-1 and 20 μg g-1 TAM treatments compare to the control. The mRNA levels of fatty acid synthase (FAS) decreased significantly in a dose-dependent manner as TAM concentration increased. The mRNA levels of two lipid catabolism-related genes (acyl-CoA oxidase (ACOX) and fatty acid transport protein (FATP)) were down-regulated among the three TAM treatments, while the enzyme activity and mRNA level of carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT-I) was up-regulated by TAM treatments. Compared to the control, the lowest levels of total lipids and phospholipids were detected in the 6.7 μg g-1 TAM treatment, while the 20 μg g-1 TAM treatment had the lowest free fatty acids concentration. The 6.7 μg g-1 TAM treatment had the lowest percentages of 16:1n-7, 18:1n-9, 18:1n-7 and total monounsaturated fatty acids (∑MUFA), whilst simultaneously recording the highest percentages of 18:2n-6 and 20:2n-6 in this treatment. Moreover, histological observations indicated that TAM caused the walls of the hepatopancreatic tubules to become brittle, with a concurrent increase in the number of blister-like cells. These results suggest that TAM damages the hepatopancreas and leads to a reduction in hepatopancreatic lipid deposition in P. trituberculatus.","Current practice and perceptions regarding pain, agitation and delirium management in patients receiving venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31202165,Journal of critical care,2019 06 15,"To characterize monitoring of pain, agitation, and delirium; investigate opioid and sedative choices; and describe prevention and treatment of delirium in adults receiving venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (vv-ECMO) for respiratory failure.",Assessment of need for lower level acuity critical care services at a tertiary acute care hospital in Canada: A prospective cohort study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31202164,Journal of critical care,2019 06 15,"Critical care beds are commonly described in three levels (highest level 3, lowest level 1).

However, the diversity of seizures among patients makes it difficult to develop universal features that are applicable for automatic seizure detection in all cases, and the rarity of seizures results in a lack of sufficient training data for classifiers.",IQ estimation by means of EEG-fNIRS recordings during a logical-mathematical intelligence test.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31202152,Computers in biology and medicine,2019 06 15,"Intelligence differences of individuals are attributed to the structural and functional differences of the brain. Neural processing operations of the human brain vary according to the difficulty level of the problem and the intelligence level of individuals. In this study, we used a bimodal system consisting of functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) and Electroencephalogram (EEG) to investigate these inter-individual differences. A continuous wave 32-channel fNIRS from OxyMonfNIRS device (Artinis) and 19-channel EEG from (g.tec's company) were utilized to study the oxygenation procedure as well as the electrical activity of the brain when doing the problems of Raven's Progressive Matrix (RPM) intelligence test. We used this information to estimate the Intelligence Quotient (IQ) of the individual without performing a complete logical-mathematical intelligence test in a long-time period and examining the answers of people to the questions. After EEG preprocessing, different features including Higuchi's fractal dimension, Shannon entropy values from wavelet transform coefficients, and average power of frequency sub-bands were extracted. Clean fNIRS signals were also used to compute features such as slope, mean, variance, kurtosis, skewness, and peak. Then dimension reduction algorithms such as Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) were applied to select an effective feature set from fNIRS and EEG in order to improve the IQ estimation process. We utilized two regression methods, i.e., Linear Regression (LR) and Support Vector Regression (SVR), to extract optimum models for the IQ determination. The best regression models based on fNIRS-EEG and fNIRS presented 3.093% and 3.690% relative error for 11 subjects, respectively.",Structural change in GadD2 of Listeria monocytogenes field isolates supports nisin resistance.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31202151,International journal of food microbiology,2019 06 15,"The lantibiotic nisin is used as a food additive to effectively inactivate a broad spectrum of Gram-positive bacteria such as Listeria monocytogenes. In total, 282 L. monocytogenes field isolates from German ready-to-eat food products, food-processing environments and patient samples and 39 Listeria reference strains were evaluated for their susceptibility to nisin. The MIC90 value was <1500 IU ml-1. Whole genome sequences (WGS) of four nisin susceptible (NS; growth <200 IU ml-1) and two nisin resistant L. monocytogenes field isolates (NR; growth >1500 IU ml-1) of serotype IIa were analyzed for DNA sequence variants (DSVs) in genes putatively associated with NR and its regulation. WGS of NR differed from NS in the gadD2 gene encoding for the glutamate decarboxylase system (GAD). Moreover, homology modeling predicted a protein structure of GadD2 in NR that promoted a less pH dependent GAD activity and may therefore be beneficial for nisin resistance. Likewise NR had a significant faster growth rate compared to NS in presence of nisin at pH 7. In conclusion, results contributed to ongoing debate that a genetic shift in GAD supports NR state.",Bacterial content and characterization of antibiotic resistant Staphylococcus aureus in Danish sushi products and association with food inspector rankings.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31202150,International journal of food microbiology,2019 06 15,"This study examined the prevalence and phenotypic and genotypic antibiotic resistance patterns of Staphylococcus aureus in sushi from 20 Danish outlets. Microbial quality of sushi products and food inspector ranking of outlets were assessed and results for thirteen of the outlets were compared with findings from a previous study in 2012. Inspector rankings were similar in the two studies. The mesophilic aerobic counts were slightly lower (p = 0.0296) in 2017 than in 2012 with average values of the 13 shops of 5.2 log CFU/g and 5.7 log CFU/g, respectively. In both studies E. coli was only found in the products from outlets that did not have consistently superior rankings. On the other hand prevalence and average counts of Staphylococcus spp. were slightly higher in 2017 (p = 0.0286) but no methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) were observed in the present study. Methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) were, however, isolated from 18.7% of sushi products with an average count below 2 log CFU/g. Based on spa and multilocus sequence typing (MLST), isolates belonged to clonal complex CC7 (t2016), CC20 (t7836), CC45 (t065, t127, t362), CC88 (t1998) and CC398 (t164, t331, t1451). The Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL)-encoding gene lukF was detected only in isolates of the t065 spa-type whereas the scn gene from the ΦSa3 prophage was detected in 76.5% of the isolates, supporting that the majority of isolates were of likely human origin. Thirty-six isolates (70.6%) were resistant to at least one of the antibiotic compounds tested. Antibiotic resistance genes that confer resistance to β-lactams (blaZ) and macrolides (ermC) were detected in 33.3% and 9.8% of isolates, respectively. The tet(K) gene that encode tetracycline resistance was only found in a t7836 strain. Overall, this study indicates that S. aureus in sushi products in Denmark do not represent a major food safety hazard due to, firstly, the low temperature and limited time of storage of product may prevent significant growth and production of toxic levels of enterotoxin of this species. Secondly, the S. aureus isolates obtained did not include MRSA variants and none of them encoded PVL that constitute one of the virulence factors in pathogenesis. Several MSSA isolates contained however genes encoding antibiotic resistance, which emphasize the potential role of foods as vehicles for transmission of such variants.",Evaluation of Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis survival during the manufacturing process of Italian raw milk hard cheeses (Parmigiano Reggiano and Grana Padano).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31202149,International journal of food microbiology,2019 06 15,"Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP), the agent of paratuberculosis in ruminants, is suspected to be involved in the aetiology of some human diseases. Notably, the consumption of milk and dairy products is considered to be the main route of human exposure to MAP because of its ability to survive during pasteurization and manufacturing processes. The aim of this study was to investigate, through a microbiological challenge test, the survival of MAP during the manufacturing and ripening period of two Italian hard cheeses, Parmigiano Reggiano and Grana Padano, made from raw bovine milk. The challenge test was performed in two different phases: the creaming phase and the manufacturing phase. The creaming phase, which is the first step of cheese production, was reproduced in the laboratory employing raw cow's milk spiked with a MAP reference strain at a final concentration of 5.58 log10 CFU/mL. After the creaming at 18 °C and 27 °C for 12 h, a decrease of 0.80 log10 and 0.77 log10 was observed in partially skimmed milk, respectively. In the second phase, two batches of raw cow's milk (1000 L each) were inoculated with MAP reference and wild strains, respectively. Then, the entire manufacturing process for Parmigiano Reggiano and Grana Padano, both of Protective Designation of Origin (PDO), was reproduced in an experimental cheese factory, starting from a concentration in milk of 5.19 ± 0.01 and 5.28 ± 0.08 log10 CFU/mL of MAP reference and wild strains, respectively. Heating the curd at 53 °C for 20 min did not affect MAP survival, however a significant decrease (p < 0.05) in MAP viability was observed during the moulding phase and after salting in brine, regarding the wild strains and the reference strain, respectively. In addition, a significant decrease was observed during the ripening period, at which time the MAP concentration dropped below the limit of detection from the second and the third month of ripening, for the wild and reference strains, respectively. Taking into account the poor data availability about MAP survival in hard cheeses, this study may improve the knowledge regarding the effect of the cheese manufacturing process on the MAP dynamics, supporting also the safety of traditional raw milk hard cheeses.",Characterization of the in situ pellicle ultrastructure formed under the influence of bovine milk and milk protein isolates.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31202148,Archives of oral biology,2019 06 15,"The present study aimed to investigate if bovine milk or milk protein isolates, respectively, alter the ultrastructure of thein situ pellicle and might therefore have an influence on oral health.",An LC-MS/MS method for the simultaneous determination of 12 psychotropic drugs and metabolites in hair: Identification of acute quetiapine poisoning using hair root.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31202147,Forensic science international,2019 06 15,"A rapid, sensitive liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method for the determination and quantification of 12 psychotropic drugs and metabolites in hair was developed and validated. After freeze grinding with methanol, the supernatant was determined by LC-MS/MS using an Allure PFPPropyl column (100 × 2.1 mm, 5 μm) with a gradient elution of acetonitrile and 10 mmol/L ammonium acetate with 0.1% formic acid, and in the subsequent analysis using multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode, two ion transitions were monitored for each analyte. The limits of detection ranged from 0.002 to 0.05 ng/mg, and the limits of quantitation were in the range of 0.005-0.1 ng/mg. Good linearity (r > 0.995) was observed for all analytes over the linear range. Acceptable intraday and interday precision (RSD ≤ 20%) and accuracy (85.3%-112.9%) were achieved. This method of detection was applied to the analysis of guinea pig hair roots after a single dose of quetiapine. Quetiapine and 7-hydroxyquetiapine were both detected in guinea pig hair roots from 5 min post administration. The concentration of quetiapine (10.3-1733.8 ng/mg) was much higher than that of 7-hydroxyquetiapine (0.1-40.6 ng/mg) in the hair roots of guinea pigs, and higher concentrations of quetiapine and 7-hydroxyquetiapine occurred in black hair root than in that of white and brown. The animal experiment demonstrated that hair roots may be a good specimen for proving acute quetiapine poisoning when other biological matrices are not available.",Effects of long term storage on secondary metabolite profiles of cannabis resin.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31202146,Forensic science international,2019 06 15,"The structural identification and the monitoring of the relative concentrations of a wide range of major (3) and minor secondary (16) metabolites used as marker substances for profiling of cannabis resin using GC-FID at the Swedish National Forensic Centre (NFC) has facilitated the mapping of their chemical and physical behaviors over a period of 48months whilst stored under different conditions (exposure to light, exposure to air, temperature). In all cases the behavior of this group of sesquiterpenes, sesquiterpenoids, cannabinoids and waxes could be directly related to their chemical lability/functionality. In particular, the identification of homologue triads for both Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) together with a group of seemingly chemically inert substances (for example, cannabicyclol(CBL) and the waxes (n-alkanes)) has created new tools for the establishment of common origins between samples of cannabis resins aged under different conditions. Since sampling of the resin blocks in NFC's method for profiling of cannabis resin is made below the surface, the effects of light incursion were found to be negligible. The effects of exposure to air (and indirectly temperature) were found to be more significant, not unexpectedly as many of the observed transformations were based on oxidation or rearrangement processes.","50 years later, insect evidence overturns Canada's most notorious case - Regina v. Steven Truscott.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31202145,Forensic science international,2019 06 15,"On 11 June 1959, the body of 12-year old Lynne Harper was discovered in a woodlot northeast of Clinton, Ontario. Although insect evidence was photographed and collected at the scene and autopsy, this evidence was not used in the 1959 trial. Instead, time of death was pinpointed to a 45-min window of 1900-1945 h on 9 June 1959 based on stomach content analysis. Based on circumstantial evidence and this time frame that he was the last suspect to see her alive, 14-year old Steven Truscott was convicted of her murder. He was scheduled to be hanged, but a temporary reprieve postponed his execution. In 1960, his death sentence was commuted to life imprisonment. Truscott was the youngest person to be sentenced to death in Canada, and his case provided the major impetus toward abolition of the death penalty in Canada. Truscott always maintained his innocence. In 2001, the Association in Defence of the Wrongly Convicted filed an appeal to have the case reopened. In 2006, the authors of this paper were contacted by Attorneys James Lockyer and Phil Campbell of the LCP Law Firm in Toronto to investigate this case. Fresh evidence was presented at the Ontario Court of Appeal in 2006-2007 including testimony of 3 forensic entomologists. This resulted in controversy regarding identification of the insects and assumptions of insect behaviour that affected the postmortem interval estimate. Lack of scientific evidence for the controversial theories proposed by one testifying entomologist resulted in disregarding his testimony. Instead, testimony by VanLaerhoven and Merritt was accepted. Based on their analysis and a re-creation experiment of the insect evidence, initial fly colonization occurred during daylight hours of 10 June 1959. The collected larvae were not likely to have been deposited on the body before dark (2140 h) on 9 June 1959 as this would have resulted in significantly larger and more advanced larval instar than were collected at the scene or autopsy. This analysis, together with a pathology reanalysis of stomach content analysis, demonstrated that the original estimate of time of death was unreliable. Truscott was with numerous witnesses prior to 1900 h and after 2000 h on 9 June 1959, thus the estimate of time of death was the most critical evidence in the original 1959 trial and the 2006-2007 appeal. On 28 August 2007, his conviction was overturned, declared a wrongful conviction and miscarriage of justice. Steven Truscott was acquitted of the murder charges.",Evaluation of the accuracy of the Nolla method for the estimation of dental age of children between 4-14 years old in Spain: A radiographic study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31202144,Forensic science international,2019 06 15,"The aim of this study was to estimate the age of subjects from their dental age by showing the different stages of tooth development using the Nolla method in a Spanish population sample considering the gender, age group, and the development of the two dental arches. The sample consisted of 604 orthopantomographs corresponding to Spanish children (male: 302 and female: 302) aged from 4 to 14 years old. The resulting chronological and dental ages were compared using Student's t-test. We obtained a good index of agreement between the evaluators and good internal consistency in the evaluation of the ages of the teeth. In general, the dental age estimates were lower than the chronological ages, obtaining an underestimation with the application of the Nolla method. In the male group, the average dental age of the maxillary teeth was 8.36 years and that of the mandibular teeth was 8.40 years, compared to the chronological age of 8.84 years in both cases. In the female group, the average dental age of the maxillary teeth was 7.76 years and that of the mandibular teeth was 7.88 years, compared to the chronological age of 8.70 years in both cases. On applying the Nolla method to our sample, a significant overestimation was observed only in children aged between 4 and 6.9 years. The Nolla method can be used as a complementary tool for estimating age in children of Spanish origin. The application of this method is more favourable in the case of individuals evaluated under the law applied to minors. In general, with this method, age is underestimated, but the calculations involved are reliable, and greater precision has been observed in male than in female. The data from this study can be used as a reference to determine the dental maturity of Spanish children and to estimate their ages."

B, Biointerfaces",2019 06 15,"Nanoemulsion-based synthesis has been introduced to enhance the bioavailability of natural compounds at target sites for their various biomedical applications. In this study, we synthesized carvacrol nanoemulsion (CN) an oil-in-water (O/W) as a nano-emulsion vehicle system by using ultrasonication emulsification for anti-angiogenesis therapy formulated by combining MCT, lecithin, and polysorbate 80 at the O/W interface called carvacrol encapsulated nanoemulsion (CEN). The diameter of CEN determined by TEM analysis was 105.32 nm. The hydrodynamic droplet size was 101.0 nm with a -39.38-mV zeta potential. The stability of the synthesized CEN was approved till 100 days without any change in diameter size distribution and encapsulation efficiency. We evaluated the role of CEN on angiogenesis in lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells both in vitro and in vivo and observed that it reduced the growth and MMP levels of A549 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Exposure to CEN decreased the activation of MAPK p38 as well as ERK. Moreover, we found that CEN reduced the expression of VEGF and CD31 in A549 cells both in vitro and in vivo. Our in-silico study also indicated the binding of carvacrol to COX-2 and VEGF at the active and allosteric sites of CD31 with low binding energy. Overall, CEN induced anti-angiogenic effects in A549 cells in vitro, in silico, and in vivo, thereby establishing its potential as targeted drug delivery vehicle against angiogenesis.",Multifunctional PEG-b-polypeptide-decorated gold nanorod for targeted combined chemo-photothermal therapy of breast cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31202131,"Colloids and surfaces. B, Biointerfaces",2019 06 15,"The combination of chemotherapy and photothermal therapy is acknowledged as one of the most promising approaches in cancer treatment. Targeted delivery and controlled drug release are two important factors for combined chemo-photothermal therapy. In this study, a multifunctional nanoplatform based on gold nanorod (GNR) decorated with folate-conjugated poly(ethylene glycol)-b-poly(L-γ-glutamylhydrazine) (FEGGH) containing disulfide linker and dihydroxyphenyl groups was developed for targeted combined chemo-photothermal therapy of breast cancer. FEGGH was synthesized by ring-opening polymerization of γ-benzyl-l-glutamate-N-carboxyanhydride using folate/cystamine-heterobifunctionalized poly(ethylene glycol) as an initiator, following by hydrazinolysis and carbodiimide reactions. FEGGH was decorated onto GNR through Au-catechol bonds. Chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin (DOX) was loaded onto the nanoplatform through pH-sensitive hydrazone linkage, obtaining final product FEGGHDOX-GNR. The DOX-loaded nanoplatform displayed excellent photostability and reduction/pH dual-responsive drug release behavior. Cytological studies demonstrated the effective internalization of FEGGHDOX-GNR into MCF-7 cells via folate-mediated endocytosis and additive therapeutic effect of combined photothermal-chemotherapy. These results indicate that our nanoplatform may be a promising strategy for targeted combined chemo-photothermal therapy of breast cancer.",Comparative studies on the surface/interface properties and aggregation behavior of mono-rhamnolipid and di-rhamnolipid.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31202130,"Colloids and surfaces.

The effects of environmental factors on equilibrium surface tension of these surfactants were studied by changing the temperature, salinity, and pH. Results show that R1 possesses a better surface activity than R2, but both are stable at low pH values and high temperature. Moreover, the diffusion and adsorption processes of R1 and R2 were studied by dynamic surface tension measurements. The initial adsorption processes of R1 and R2 were diffusion-controlled, and the effective diffusion coefficient of R1 was higher than that of R2 at the same concentration. We also monitored the dynamic interfacial tension curves of R1 and R2 with or without aging at high temperature, revealing that both feature high temperature resistance, but R1 exhibited a better interfacial activity than R2. For aggregation behavior in the bulk phase, dynamic light scattering and UV - vis spectrophotometry were used to measure and observe the aggregation of rhamnolipids R1 and R2 at different temperatures and pH values. Results show the vesicle-to-micelle transformation of R1 and R2 aggregates with decreasing pH.

This review essentially details the break-up process and initially summarizes the different types of bubble deformation processes which lead to break-up. Break-up is considered in high and low turbulent (pseudo-static) conditions and the effect of fluctuations and shear forces on the break-up is reviewed. Different mechanisms of break-up are discussed including shearing-off, coalescence induced pitching and impact pinching following air entrapment. Also, the influence of bubble size, interfacial stability, and surfactant on break-up are reviewed and a summary of recent experimental techniques presented. Finally, the break-up process which occurs in micro-fluidics is summarized.",Evaluation of anticancer effect in vitro and in vivo of iridium(III) complexes on gastric carcinoma SGC-7901 cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31202128,European journal of medicinal chemistry,2019 06 15,"This work mainly introduces the synthesis and characterization of three iridium(III) complexes [Ir(ppy)2(adppz)](PF6) (Ir-1), [Ir(bzq)2(addpz)](PF6) (Ir-2) and [Ir(piq)2(adppz)](PF6) (Ir-3). The complexes are more cytotoxic than cisplatin against tumor cell lines such as SGC-7901, A549, HeLa, Eca-109, HepG2 and BEL-7402. The toxicity test results indicated that complexes Ir-1, Ir-2 and Ir-3 can effectively inhibit the cell growth of SGC-7901 cells, and the measured IC50 values are 1.8 ± 0.4, 1.6 ± 0.3 and 0.8 ± 0.1 μM, respectively. AO/EB staining and flow apoptosis confirmed that SGC-7901 cells were caused apoptosis after being treated with the complexes. Along with the increase of endogenous ROS and Ca2+ levels, mitochondrial membrane potential collapse and massive release of cytochrome c, it is fully demonstrated that these complexes induce apoptosis through ROS-mediated mitochondrial pathway. At the same time, the complex Ir-3 is outstanding in the inhibition of tumor growth in vivo. Combined with the above results, it provides a favorable foundation for the future development of more effective anti-tumor drugs.",Studies of anticancer activity in vitro and in vivo of iridium(III) polypyridyl complexes-loaded liposomes as drug delivery system.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31202127,European journal of medicinal chemistry,2019 06 15,"Two iridium(III) polypyridyl complexes [Ir(ppy)2(HPIP)](PF6) (Ir-1), [Ir(ppy)2(BHPIP)](PF6) (Ir-2) and their liposomes Ir-1-Lipo and Ir-2-Lipo were synthesized and characterized by elemental analysis, IR, 1H NMR and 13C NMR. The anticancer activity in vitro and in vivo was evaluated. The cytotoxic activity in vitro of the complexes and their liposomes Ir-1-Lipo and Ir-2-Lipo against cancer cells was investigated by MTT methods. Ir-1 and Ir-2 show no cytotoxic activity, while Ir-1-Lipo and Ir-2-Lipo exhibit high cytotoxic effect. The IC50 values range from 5.2 ± 0.8 to 22.3 ± 1.8 μM. The apoptosis, reactive oxygen species, the change of mitochondrial membrane potential, intracellular Ca2+ levels and a release of cytochrome c were investigated. The effect of Ir-1-Lipo and Ir-2-Lipo on microtubules was also explored. In the C57BL/6 mice model, Ir-1 only displays a tumor inhibitory rate of 23.21%, while lr-1-Lipo exhibits satisfactory in vivo antitumor efficacy with tumor inhibitory rate of 72.55%. This study demonstrates that complexes encapsulated in liposomes induce apoptosis in B16 through ROS-mediated lysosomal-mitochondria dysfunction, inhibition of polymerization of microtubules and induce cell cycle arrest at S phase.","Exploiting the 1-(4-fluorobenzyl)piperazine fragment for the development of novel tyrosinase inhibitors as anti-melanogenic agents: Design, synthesis, structural insights and biological profile.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31202126,European journal of medicinal chemistry,2019 06 15,"The development of Tyrosinase inhibitors (TYRIs) could represent an efficacious strategy for pharmacological intervention on skin pathologies related to aberrant production of melanin. Based on in silico studies we designed and tested a library of twenty-four compounds bearing the 4-(4-fluorobenzyl)piperazin-1-yl]-fragment. As result, we identified several compounds with excellent inhibit effects at low micromolar concentration against TYR from Agaricus bisporus (TyM). Among them, compound 25 (IC50 = 0.96 μM) proved to be ∼20-fold more potent than the reference compound kojic acid (IC50 = 17.76 μM) having wide applications in the cosmetics and pharmaceutical industries. The mode of interaction of active inhibitor 25 was deciphered by means of crystallography as well as molecular docking and these results were consistent with kinetic experiments. Moreover, the identified compound 25 exhibited no considerable cytotoxicity and showed anti-melanogenic effects on B16F10 melanoma cells. Therefore, a combination of computational and biochemical approaches could represent a rational guidelines for further structural modification of this class of compounds as future anti-melanogenic agents.",Role of long non-coding RNAs in lymphoma: A systematic review and clinical perspectives.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31202125,Critical reviews in oncology/hematology,2019 06 15,"Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), are over 200 nucleotides in length, and they rarely act as templates for protein synthesis. Mounting studies have shown that lncRNAs play a crucial regulatory role in various processes that sustain life, such as epigenetic regulation, cell cycle control, splicing, and post-transcriptional regulation. LncRNAs were aberrantly expressed in most hematological malignancies including lymphoma, participating in tumor suppression or promoting oncogenesis and modulating key genes in different pathways. The specific expression patterns of lncRNAs in lymphoma make them good candidates to be used as diagnostic biomarkers or as therapeutic targets. LncRNAs can be targeted by multiple approaches including nucleic acid therapeutics, CRISPR/Cas genome editing techniques, small molecule inhibitors, and gene therapy. Efforts are made to develop therapeutic strategies aimed at targeting lncRNAs, but there are still some avenues to be covered before they can be applied to the clinical treatment of lymphoma.",The microbiome and cancer for clinicians.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31202124,Critical reviews in oncology/hematology,2019 06 15,"The human microbiome is an emerging target in cancer development and therapeutics. It may be directly oncogenic, through promotion of mucosal inflammation or systemic dysregulation, or may alter anti-cancer immunity/therapy. Microorganisms within, adjacent to and distant from tumors may affect cancer progression, and interactions and differences between these populations can influence the course of disease. Here we review the microbiome as it pertains to cancer for clinicians. The microbiota of cancers including colorectal, pancreas, breast and prostate are discussed. We examine ""omics"" technologies, microbiota associated with tumor tissue and tumor-site fluids such as feces and urine, as well as indirect effects of the gut microbiome. We describe roles of the microbiome in immunotherapy, and how it can be modulated to improve cancer therapeutics. While research is still at an early stage, there is potential to exploit the microbiome, as modulation may increase efficacy of treatments, reduce toxicities and prevent carcinogenesis.",Impacts of shifting responsibility for high-cost individuals on Health Insurance Exchange plan premiums and cost-sharing provisions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31202123,Journal of health economics,2019 06 15,"Insurance companies can respond to increases in expected per-capita healthcare expenditures by adjusting premiums, cost-sharing requirements, and/or plan generosity. We use a Difference-in-Difference model with Plan-level Fixed Effects to estimate the impacts of increases in expected expenditures generated by closure of state-operated High Risk Pools (HRPs). For Silver plans, we find that issuers responded to HRP closures by increasing both premiums and deductibles, and by increasing the ratios of premiums to deductibles. This adjustment to the structure of plan prices is consistent with the hypothesis that issuers will be reluctant to adjust deductibles, because consumers tend to overweight changes in deductibles over changes in premiums. The increase in the ratio of premiums to deductibles indicates that the increase in expected expenditures triggered an increase in the share of total risk-pool healthcare expenditures paid by low healthcare utilizers, and a decrease in the share paid by high utilizers."

However, the application of ADM1 to acidogenic fermentation is limited by its use of constant stoichiometry to describe the formation of products via carbohydrate fermentation. This study presents a modification of ADM1 using a variable acidogenic stoichiometric approach in which the hydrogen partial pressure (pH2) and pH are used to predict and regulate the acidogenic process. The fermentation of ethanol and its kinetics were introduced into the model structure. Experimental data from mixed acid-type fermentation in a 28.4 L anaerobic baffled reactor (ABR) fed with a sucrose solution with a chemical oxygen demand of 4000 mg L-1 were used to calibrate the model parameters. Two case studies involving continuous ethanol-type fermentation in an ABR and a continuous stirring tank reactor (CSTR) were used to validate the approach. The modified model achieved good predictions of the experimental data collected from butyric acid, propionic acid, mixed acid, and ethanol-type fermentation in the ABR and CSTR using the standard ADM1 parameter values without any parameter fitting beyond implementation of the variable acidogenic stoichiometry. The pH2 and pH thresholds in butyric acid, propionic acid, mixed acid, and ethanol-type fermentation could be predicted using this model, which was shown to be a valid mathematical tool for the regulation of fermentation type.",Diversity and antibiotic resistance among Escherichia coli populations in hospital and community wastewater compared to wastewater at the receiving urban treatment plant.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31202110,Water research,2019 06 15,"Bacterial diversity and antimicrobial resistance patterns among the indicator organism Escherichia coli were monitored in wastewater samples collected over one year from a hospital (HW), a community (CW) and the receiving urban (UW) wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). We compared levels of antibiotic resistance in the different types of wastewater, and identified whether resistant strains were endemic in the wastewater system. If so, implementation of local treatment at certain resistance hotspots (e.g. hospital outlets) could be used to decrease the amount of resistant bacteria in the wastewater. E. coli from HW (n = 2644), CW (n = 2525) and UW (n = 2693) were analyzed by biochemical phenotyping (PhenePlate System) and antimicrobial susceptibility testing to nine antibiotics (AREB System). The phenotypic diversities of the total E. coli populations were similar for all three sites (Simpson's Diversity index, Di = 0.973), however for individual samples, HW showed low diversities (Median Di = 0.800) and the E. coli flora was often dominated by strains that may have originated from the fecal flora of single individuals. The diversities in CW samples was higher (Median Di = 0.936), and UW samples showed similar diversities as the whole collection of isolates (Median Di = 0.971). Resistance to at least one of the nine antibiotics was observed in 45% of the HW isolates, 44% of CW isolates, and 33% of UW isolates. Resistance to gentamicin and chloramphenicol was uncommon (3.2 and 5.3%, respectively), whereas resistance to tetracycline and ampicillin was most common (24% and 31%, respectively). Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing E. coli (ESBL-EC) were more common in HW (11.5%) and in CW (6.9%) compared to UW (3.7%). A high diversity (Di = 0.974) was observed among ESBL-EC isolates from UW (n = 99), indicating absence of any clonal structure among these isolates. Common PhP types of ESBL-EC often dominated in each HW sample, but were not identified across different samples, whereas ESBL-EC in CW showed low diversity (Di = 0.857) and were dominated by a specific PhP type that was found across almost all CW samples. The antibiotic resistance rates were highest in hospital wastewater, but surprisingly they were also high in the studied community wastewater, compared to the urban wastewater. The relative contribution of HW seemed low in terms of dissemination of antibiotic resistant bacteria to the WWTP.","From the Popularization of Microscopy in the Victorian Age: A Lesson for Today's ""Outreach"".",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31202109,Protist,2019 06 15,"In the latter half of the Victorian Age (1837-1901) microscopy was introduced as popular past-time. Many books were published aimed at general audiences, both adult and juvenile, on microscopy. Here I consider 5 of these popular books of particular interest to protistologists as they included presentations of 'infusoria' or 'animalcules'. I focus on the scientific backgrounds of the authors, from what we know of them, and the approaches taken to engage the reader based on their texts and illustrations. The possible lesson to be drawn from this exercise concerns our oft-mandated efforts in ""Outreach"". The methods used by 19th century popularizes of the 'wonders of the microscopic world' can likely be used today. They appealed to the imagination, to empowerment, and gave very practical instructions on how to see the invisible.

Herein, a novel carbon nanocomposite composed of fullerene nanoparticles, nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes and graphene oxide (C60NPs-N-CNTs/GO) was facilely synthesized for the first time, which not only possessed a large specific surface area and excellent conductivity, but also exhibited outstanding inherent electroactive property, and therefore served as nanocarrier and redox nanoprobe simultaneously. Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) was then uniformly anchored onto the surface of such nanocomposite via Au-N bonds to bind with MPT64 antigen aptamer Ⅱ (MAA Ⅱ), forming the tracer label to realize generation and amplification of electrochemical signal. Additionally, conductive polyethyleneimine (PEI)-functionalized Fe-based metal-organic framework (P-MOF) was used as a sensing platform to absorb bimetallic core-shell Au-Pt nanoparticles (Au@Pt), which could accelerate electron transfer and increase the immobilization of MPT64 antigen aptamer Ⅰ (MAA Ⅰ). After the typical sandwich-type protein-aptamer recognition, the inherent electroactivity of the tracer label was provoked by tetraoctylammonium bromide (TOAB), leading to a well-defined current response. Under the optimum condition, the proposed aptasensor showed a wide linear range for MPT64 detection from 1 fg/mL to 1 ng/mL with a limit of detection (LOD) as low as 0.33 fg/mL. More importantly, it was successfully used for MPT64 antigen detection in human serum, exhibiting a promising prospect for TB diagnosis in clinical practice.",Substance use and misuse among sexual and gender minority youth.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31202102,Current opinion in psychology,2019 06 15,"Sexual and gender minority youth are at greater risk for substance use and misuse compared to their heterosexual and cisgender peers.

The transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) plays a pivotal role in progression of renal fibrosis. TGF-β transduces its downstream signalling by phosphorylation of smad2/3 and also regulates epithelial-mesenchymal-transition (EMT), a program centrally involved in activation of fibroblasts. Renal fibrosis was induced in Swiss albino mice by unilateral ureteral obstruction of animals. Kidney tissues were evaluated for fibrotic protein expression by western blot and immunohistochemistry. The administration of nimbolide (NB) to UUO animals reduced the oxidative stress, expression of ECM proteins, TGF-β, p-smad and EMT program. Further, NB administration also improved histoarchitecture of obstructed kidney and reduced the collagen deposition in kidney. Our results provided compelling evidence to support antifibrotic activity of NB by reduction in oxidative stress, TGF-β, and EMT program in fibrotic kidney. The administration of NB in animals blunted the UUO-induced renal injury, inflammation and reduced fibrogenesis in obstructed kidney."

Descriptive statistical analysis found a large majority of clients were 'very satisfied' with the crisis worker, forensic physician and police. Content analysis of the free text responses found more nuanced experiences, which impacted clients overall experience within the SARC. These comments were split into two themes, 'Compliments' and 'Suggestions for improvement'. There were 404 comments focusing on compliments of the service and the staff. Compliments included messages of thanks, with praise for professionalism of the staff and importance of the service. Clients noted in particular that the FME service was delivered in challenging circumstances i.e. the immediate aftermath of a sexual assault. There were 34 comments which made suggestions for improvements. These suggestions focused on pragmatic and logistic issues.","Comparative study of symptom profile of catatonia in patients with psychotic disorders, affective disorders and organic disorders.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31202087,Asian journal of psychiatry,2019 06 15,"To compare the symptom profile of catatonia among patients with affective, psychotic and organic disorders.",Intolerance of uncertainty and eating disorder behaviour: Piloting a consumption task in a non-clinical sample.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31202086,Journal of behavior therapy and experimental psychiatry,2019 06 15,"Intolerance of uncertainty (IU) is a transdiagnostic process contributing to the maintenance of anxiety disorders, and is a potential target for treatment.

Moreover, functional cortico-cerebellar subnetworks exhibit topographic specialization for different aspects of visual attentional processing. Thus, cerebellar lobule VIIb/VIIIa, rather than simply supporting motor functions, appears to be an integral part of the brain's visual attentional circuitry.

In this study, RNA-seq was performed to exploit the related shell color genes and determine the genetic basis of the different shell colors. Nine sequence libraries with those three shell colors of hard clam were constructed; 406,377 transcripts and 248,251 unigenes were obtained with N50 values of 1365 and 1682 base pairs, respectively. Cluster analysis identified 363, 392, and 220 genes exclusively highly expressed in red, white, and mottled clams, respectively. We further classified differentially expressed genes (DEGs), the genes involved in lipid binding and transport, signal transduction, ATP synthesis, and other processes in the red vs white comparison were found, which may participate in red shell formation. DEGs related to signal transduction, particularly G protein-coupled receptor activity, were found in the red vs mottled comparison, suggesting that these genes might be important in mottled shell formation. In the white vs mottled comparison, DEGs involved in zinc ion binding were found. Our results provide new insights into shell color formation mechanisms in molluscs.

Monochlorobimane (MCB), a dye conjugated with GSH by glutathione-s-transferase (GST) to form a fluorescent adduct, was used to visualize organ-specific GSH utilization in live developing zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos. Embryos were incubated in 20 μM MCB for 1 h and imaged on an epifluorescence microscope. GSH conjugation with MCB was high during early organogenesis, decreasing as embryos aged. The heart had fluorescence 21-fold above autofluorescence at 24 hpf, dropping to 8.5-fold by 48 hpf; this increased again by 72 hpf to 23.5-fold, and stayed high till 96 hpf (18-fold). The brain had lower fluorescence (10-fold) at 24 and 48 hpf, steadily increasing to 30-fold by 96 hpf. The sensitivity and specificity of MCB staining was then tested with known GSH modulators. A 10-min treatment at 48 hpf with 750 μM tert-butylhydroperoxide, caused organ-specific reductions in staining, with the heart losing 30% fluorescence, and, the brain ventricle losing 47% fluorescence. A 24 h treatment from 24-48 hpf with 100 μM of N-Acetylcysteine (NAC) resulted in significantly increased fluorescence, with the brain ventricle and heart showing 312% and 240% increases respectively, these were abolished upon co-treatment with 5 μM BSO, an inhibitor of the enzyme that utilizes NAC to synthesize GSH.

In our study, we analysed 55 childhood hyperdiploid BCP-ALL patients using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) microarray testing. The group consisted mostly of patients with the modal number of chromosomes between 54 and 58 (34 cases). Within this group, Trisomy 4 and Trisomy 10 (30 cases) were the most frequent cases. Additionally, a total of 93 structural abnormalities mainly affecting chromosomes 1, 6, 9, 12, and 17 as well as 68 copy number alterations (CNAs) were identified. The microarray testing revealed a loss of ETV6, IKZF1, CDKN2A/CDKN2B, PAX5, and RB1. Moreover, chromosomal abnormalities resulting in the loss of heterozygosity (LOH) were also observed. Currently, patients with hyperdiploidy constitute a genetically heterogeneous group, and therefore, it is insufficient to rely only on banding cytogenetic analysis for the identification of hyperdiploid karyotype. Microarray testing has been proven an effective and satisfactory tool for the analysis of molecular karyotypes and to redefine the prognostic criteria in hyperdiploid patients."

As an advanced Fenton-like catalyst, the obtained Fe3C/C composite displayed high catalytic reactivity to generate hydroxyl radicals. It is worth to note that the removal rate of methylene blue (MB) could effectively reach 100% in a wide pH range (pH = 2˜12) and the maximum degradation capacity of the composite is 660 mg/g. The stability and reusability of Fe3C/C composite catalyst have also been tested, which could remain the removal rate at 100% after 6 consecutive runs. To illustrate the practical application possibility, the Fe3C/C composite catalyst was used for degradation of papermaking and dyeing waste water, which could reduce the COD (chemical oxygen demand) value to less than 50. Additionally, the antibiotic norfloxacin (NOR) could also be catalytically removed by the Fe3C/C composite and the possible removal pathway has also been proposed. The excellent removal performance of Fe3C/C composite for MB and NOR may be attributed to the synergistic effect between porous carbon adsorption and Fe3C catalysis. This study not only provides novel insights into recycling of waste biomass, but also paves a new way for the application of Fe3C/C in dyes and antibiotics waste water treatment areas.","Interaction among soil physicochemical properties, bacterial community structure, and arsenic contamination: Clay-induced change in long-term arsenic contaminated soils.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31202066,Journal of hazardous materials,2019 06 15,"Pyrosequencing analyses to determine soil bacterial communities were conducted with forty-two soil samples collected from rice paddy and forest/farmland soils (Group A and B, respectively) at a long-term As-contaminated site. Soil physicochemical properties, such as the concentrations of As, Fe, Al, and Mn, pH, organic matter content, and clay content, were found to be significantly different with land use, and more importantly, strongly affected the bacterial community structure of the soil samples. When fitting the soil properties onto a nonmetric multidimensional scale plot of soil bacterial communities, clay content was found to be the most important factor in clustering the bacterial communities (R2 = 0.4831, p-value = 0.001). Phylum Chloroflexi (-1.03 of bioplot score) and Planctomycetes (1.31 of bioplot score) showed a significant relationship with clay content in soil samples. Interestingly, thebacterial phylotypes linked to clay content were only found in the soil samples of group B with low clay content, and had a strong relationship to As contamination in the redundancy analysis and the correlation analysis.Our results suggest that clay content seems to be negatively related to As contamination in soils, which, in turn, strongly influences the structure of bacterial communities in As-contaminated soil.",Release of tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA)-derived non-extractable residues in oxic soil and the effects of the TBBPA-degrading bacterium Ochrobactrum sp. strain T.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31202065,Journal of hazardous materials,2019 06 15,"Tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA) forms large amount of non-extractable residues (NER) in soil. However, the stability of TBBPA-NER with TBBPA degrader in soil had not been determined. In this study, a 14C-tracer was used to follow the release and alteration of TBBPA-derived NER during 214 days of incubation in oxic soil and in the presence or absence of the TBBPA-degrading bacterium Ochrobatrum sp. strain T. In the absence of strain T, 1.89% of the TBBPA and its metabolites were slowly released from the NER, with TBBPA as the predominant component, accompanied by 2.47% mineralization by day 91 of the incubation. The addition of active cells strongly stimulated the release and mineralization of NER (10.93% and 4.64%, respectively), reduced the amount of the ester-linked fraction, and transformed NER from humin-bound to HA-bound forms. Cells added to the soil in sterilized form had much smaller effects on the stability and internal alterations of NER. Among the ester-linked compounds, 47.4% consisted of TBBPA; two metabolites were so detected. These results provide new information on the stability and internal transformation of TBBPA-NER in soil during its long-term incubation and underlines the importance of microbial TBBPA degraders in determining the composition of NER in soil.",Activation of fulvic acid-like in paper mill effluents using H2O2/TiO2 catalytic oxidation: Characterization and salt stress bioassays.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31202064,Journal of hazardous materials,2019 06 15,"Increasing environmental concerns about organic waste in paper mill effluents demand alternative wastewater management technology. We reported novel activation of fulvic acid-like in paper mill effluents using hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as oxidizer and titanium oxide (TiO2) as catalyst. Spectroscopic characteristics of fulvic acid-like in paper mill effluents before and after activation (PFA and PFA-Os, respectively) were compared with a benchmark fulvic acid extracted from leonardite (LFA). Results indicated that PFA-Os exhibited less lignin structures, more functional groups and lower molecular weight than PFA, sharing much similarity with LFA. Among PFA-Os with varying degrees of oxidation, PFA-O-3 activated with 1:2 vol ratio of paper mill effluent and 30% H2O2 for 20 min digestion at 90 °C stands out to be the optimal for further examination of its biological activity. Bioassays with rice seed/seedling indicated that applications of LFA at 2-5 mg-C/L and PFA-O-3 at 60-100 mg-C/L significantly increased rice seed germination rate and seedling growth under salt stress imposed with 100 mM NaCl. The mechanism was mainly through reduced oxidative damage via activation of antioxidative enzymes and lipid peroxidation.

However, the metal surfaces make these materials very unstable in ambient atmosphere. This study explored the method of applying thin films of inorganic materials onto the surface of Zr powder and investigated the effects of different surface coatings on the energy release and ignition process of Zr. Thin films of Al2O3 and ZnO were deposited on a commercial micron-scale Zr powder by atomic layer deposition (ALD). Growth kinetics of ALD films on the Zr particles were studied using various tools. Chemical and structural characterizations revealed that the Zr particles were completely encapsulated by uniform Al2O3 or ZnO films. The thicknesses of the encapsulation layers could be precisely controlled. ALD Al2O3 coatings exhibited a unique surface-sealing effect, which inhibited the low temperature oxidation of Zr in ambient air. Laser and electrostatic discharge (ESD) ignition tests revealed that ALD Al2O3 coatings extended the ignition delay and reduced the ESD sensitivity of the Zr powder. In comparison, ALD ZnO coatings could not form effective gas diffusion barriers, therefore they could not change the oxidation process of Zr and only showed modest effects on ignition and ESD sensitivity of the Zr powder.","Preparation and characterization of styrene-butadiene-styrene membrane incorporated with graphene nanosheets for pervaporative removal of 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene from water.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31202062,Journal of hazardous materials,2019 06 15,"In the present study, novel styrene-butadiene-styrene (SBS) membranes were prepared by the addition of graphene (Gr) nanosheets to the casting solution and were utilized in the pervaporative separation of a dilute solution of 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene (1,2,4-TMB) as a volatile organic compound (VOC) in water. Several characterizations such as field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), mechanical tensile test, and determination of water contact angle and swelling degree were conducted to investigate the properties of the prepared membranes. The results showed that with the addition of Gr the membrane thermal stability and hydrophobicity were increased while there was an optimum Gr loading to achieve the highest elastic modulus and tensile strength. Moreover, it was found that by increasing the Gr concentration up to 0.5 wt. %, the separation factor and pervaporation separation index (PSI) were increased by 250% and 43% compared to pure SBS membrane and reached 930 and 545 kg/m2h, respectively.","Cadmium solubility in paddy soil amended with organic matter, sulfate, and iron oxide in alternative watering conditions.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31202061,Journal of hazardous materials,2019 06 15,"We successfully accounted for the dynamics of cadmium (Cd) solubility in paddy soil that contained a realistically low total Cd concentration (0.36 mg kg-1) after submergence and redrying by monitoring multiple chemical and microbial soil properties. The addition of rice straw promoted greater microbial iron reduction and induced a greater increase in soil pH after submergence, compared to the control and treatments with added gypsum or hematite. Consequently, dissolved Cd decreased to under the detection limit in one week in the straw-amended treatment but remained high even after eight weeks in the other three treatments. The Cd solubility strongly correlated with soil pH and was unlikely to decrease due to Cd precipitation in secondary iron minerals. After five weeks of redrying, the dissolved Cd content was still the lowest, and the putative iron-reducing bacteria Geobacter remained the most abundant in the straw-amended soil. The results suggest that the addition of organic matter can efficiently immobilize soil Cd at an environmentally realistic concentration by stimulating the microbial reduction of native oxidized soil components after submergence, while adding extra iron oxide or sulfate alone is not effective because it does not eliminate the limitation imposed by electron donors on microbial reduction.",Characterization and adsorption performance of graphene oxide - montmorillonite nanocomposite for the simultaneous removal of Pb2+ and p-nitrophenol.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31202060,Journal of hazardous materials,2019 06 15,"Montmorillonite-graphene oxide composite (MGC) with their own advantages was successfully fabricated for the simultaneous treatment of the combined pollution wastewater containing heavy metal ions and organic pollutants. The features of MGC were analyzed by X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Subsequently, a series of batch experiments were carried out to investigate the adsorption performance of Pb2+ and p-nitrophenol (PNP) onto MGC in single and binary system. The results indicated that MGC exhibited a gossamer layer with spots and a larger interlayer spacing. In single adsorption experiment, the removal of PNP by MGC reached 96.82%, while Pb2+ removal reached 98.94%, which was maintained at the same level as montmorillonite. In binary acidic system of Pb2+ and PNP, the removal of Pb2+ reached 98.23%, while PNP removal dropped to 51.06% due to their competitive adsorption. The thermodynamic study indicated that the chemisorption was predominant in the adsorption of Pb2+ onto MGC, while physisorption was for PNP. It was exactly that the strong competitiveness of Pb2+ brought the remarkable reduction in PNP adsorption capacity in the simultaneous adsorption.",Sequential biowashing-biopile processes for remediation of crude oil contaminated soil in Kuwait.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31202059,Journal of hazardous materials,2019 06 15,"The application of biological processes for remediation of the aged crude oil-contaminated soil of Kuwait can be an inefficient way, thus, this study developed 20 d-sequential biowashing and biopile processes where the biowashing step uses an enrichment culture of the indigenous soil bacterial community and the biopile step includes hemoglobin-catalyzed oxidation (HCO). The residual total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) concentrations and CO2 generation were measured to determine the removal efficiency, and the bacterial community changes were studied to investigate the effect of the sequential processes on the soil indigenous bacterial community. The enrichment culture grown on hemoglobin showed an increased surface activity, and this promoted desorption and emulsification of crude oil from the soil sample in the biowashing step resulting in 75% TPH removal. Potential surfactant-producing bacterial species were observed in the soil sample after biowashing. The HCO in the beginning of the biopile step removed 21% of the residual TPH, and further TPH removal was observed with a longer biopile period. Overall, the sequential biowashing and biopile processes removed 86% TPH. The results show that the developed sequential biowashing and biopile processes can be used to efficiently remediate the aged crude oil-contaminated soil of Kuwait.",Effect of solar photo-Fenton process in raceway pond reactors at neutral pH on antibiotic resistance determinants in secondary treated urban wastewater.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31202058,Journal of hazardous materials,2019 06 15,"Solar photo-Fenton process in raceway pond reactors was investigated at neutral pH as a sustainable tertiary treatment of real urban wastewater. In particular, the effect on antibiotic resistance determinants was evaluated. An effective inactivation of different wild bacterial populations was achieved considering total and cefotaxime resistant bacteria. The detection limit (1 CFU mL-1) was achieved in the range 80-100 min (5.4-6.7 kJ L-1 of cumulative solar energy required) for Total Coliforms (TC) (40-60 min for resistant TC, 4.3-5.2 kJ L-1), 60-80 min (4.5-5.4 kJ L-1) for Escherichia coli (E. coli) (40 min for resistant E. coli, 4.1-4.7 kJ L-1) and 40-60 min (3.9-4.5 kJ L-1) for Enterococcus sp. (Entero) (30-40 min for resistant Entero, 3.2-3.8 kJ L-1) with 20 mg L-1 Fe2+ and 50 mg L-1 H2O2. Under these mild oxidation conditions, 7 out of the 10 detected antibiotics were effectively removed (60-100%). As the removal of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) is of concern, no conclusive results were obtained, as sulfonamide resistance gene was reduced to some extent (relative abundance <1), meanwhile class 1 integron intI1 and ß-lactam resistance genes were not affected. Accordingly, more research and likely more intensive oxidative conditions are needed for an efficient ARGs removal."

From 144 eligible records identified by means of a systematic search in PubMed, Embase and Web of Knowledge databases, published between May 2015 and 1 July 2018, 26 records met the inclusion criteria. We extracted quantitative data on public exposure in different indoors, outdoors and transport environments. The data was descriptively analyzed with respect to the exposure patterns between different types of environments. Mean RF-EMF exposure in homes, schools and offices were between 0.04 and 0.76 V/m. Mean outdoor exposure values ranged from 0.07 to 1.27 V/m with downlink signals from mobile phone base stations being the most relevant contributor. RF-EMF levels tended to increase with increasing urbanity. Levels in public transport (bus, train and tram) and cars were between 0.14 and 0.69 V/m. The highest levels, up to 1.97 V/m, were measured in public transport stations with downlink as the most relevant contributor. In line with previous studies, RF-EMF exposure levels were highest in the transportation systems followed by outdoor and private indoor environments. This review does not indicate a noticeable increase in everyday RF-EMF exposure since 2012 despite increasing use of wireless communication devices.","Effect of residential exposure to green space on maternal blood glucose levels, impaired glucose tolerance, and gestational diabetes mellitus.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31202042,Environmental research,2019 06 15,"Residential surrounding green spaces can affect human health.

The EtOAc fraction of a Gnetum latifolium extract showed inhibitory activity against neuroinflammation induced by the transfection of Aβ1-42 into microglial BV-2 cells. The bioassay-guided isolation of the 70% EtOH extract of this plant resulted in three previously undescribed resveratrol oligostilbenes and ten known stilbene derivatives. The structures of the isolated compounds were established based on extensive NMR spectroscopic analysis. The absolute configurations of the three undescribed compounds were confirmed by comparison with available compounds with known stereochemistry and by ECD calculations and molecular modelling. Latifoliols A and B are the first reported oligostilbenes with a bridged 3-oxabicyclo[3.3.0]octane moiety, and latifoliol C was formed by the condensation of gnemontanin G with oxyresveratrol. Moreover, the hypothetical biogenetic pathway of latifoliols A, B and C was proposed. The potential anti-inflammatory activities of the thirteen isolated compounds were tested by measuring their effect on the secreted NO concentrations induced by transfection with plasmids expressing the Aβ1-42 gene in the BV-2 cell line. Interestingly, cis- and trans-shegansu B and latifolol, whose structures contained double bonds, strongly inhibited NO secretion in BV-2 cells, supporting the double binding effect of the stilbene derivative on inhibitory activity.","Roles of age, gender and psychological difficulties in adolescent mentalizing.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31202040,Journal of adolescence,2019 06 15,"Adolescence is a critical period for the development of mentalizing - the imaginative capacity to understand one's own and others' behaviour in terms of underlying mental states.

Although many models have been developed to predict the mixture toxicities such as concentration addition (CA) and independent action (IA), they cannot solve these challenges perfectly. This study has developed an improved inverse distance weighted (IDW) interpolation for prediction of the mixture toxicities. IDW uses the mixture and the single compound as scatter points in space, and the space can be constructed by the concentration axes of various components in the mixture system. Some known mixtures (or the single compound) closest to the unknown mixture are selected as interpolation nodes. To be more accurate in calculation, a new normalization method for concentration has been proposed through dividing the concentration of the mixture and the single compound by the respective EC50 values. Sixteen binary mixture systems are selected for leave-one-out cross-validation and three binary mixture systems are selected for external validation. The results show that the accuracy of IDW is ≥95% for three types of mixtures including no hormetic component, one hormetic component (show no toxicological interaction), and two hormetic components. The IDW also show higher prediction accuracy than that of CA and IA.

The regulation of telomerase activity is of medical relevance, as it has been implicated in human diseases such as cancer, as well as in aging. Until recently, structural information on this enzyme that would facilitate its clinical manipulation had been lacking due to telomerase very low abundance in cells. Recent cryo-EM structures of both the human and Tetrahymena thermophila telomerases have provided a picture of both the shared catalytic core of telomerase and its interaction with species-specific factors that play different roles in telomerase RNP assembly and function. We discuss also progress toward an understanding of telomerase RNP biogenesis and telomere recruitment from recent studies.",Enhanced nitrogen removal and quantitative analysis of removal mechanism in multistage surface flow constructed wetlands for the large-scale treatment of swine wastewater.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31202022,Journal of environmental management,2019 06 15,"Constructed wetlands have recently been studied as a form of green infrastructure for the enhanced removal of nitrogen (N). This study aimed to demonstrate the use of multistage surface flow constructed wetland (SFCW) for treatment of swine wastewater. The results showed chemical oxygen demand (COD), total nitrogen (TN), NH4+, and NO3- removal rates of 16.3 g m-2 d-1, 9.14 g m-2 d-1, 7.75 g m-2 d-1, and 45.49 mg m-2 d-1, respectively. The sediment and plant absorption N rates were 2.44 g m-2 d-1, and 1.24 g m-2 d-1, respectively. Moreover, the microbial process which is the primary process, by which N is removed, accounted for 56.75-65.35%. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) revealed the highest microbial abundance in the segment of the SFCW with high N concentration. Ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and nirK could be primarily responsible for the high removal rate of N. Factors like pH, DO, COD, N, and OM play an important role in influencing microbial abundance. It is suggested that the multistage SFCW has a promising future for the large scale treatment of swine wastewater.",Mining of the association rules between industrialization level and air quality to inform high-quality development in China.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31202021,Journal of environmental management,2019 06 15,"It is an urgent challenge to coordinate industrialization and air quality in China since the rapid industrialization over the past forty years caused serious air pollution. In this paper, we measured the industrialization levels of the 31 regions in China from 2003 to 2017 as a sum of per capita gross domestic product (GDP), urban population (% of total), tertiary vs. secondary industry output ratio, non-agricultural output value (% of GDP), non-agricultural employment proportion, and the proportion of added value of manufacturing in the total added value of commodity. We measured air quality as a sum of annual SO2, NO2 and PM10 concentrations. In general, the industrialization level continuously increased while air pollution was reduced in spite of some fluctuations in China. Our results show air pollution presented N-shape relations with the industrialization level in China in the periods from 2003 to 2008, 2009 to 2013, and 2014 to 2017. Air pollution increases as the industrialization occurs but later deceases as the industrialization level improves. However, air pollution rebounds as the industrialization moves further but this rebound became weaker in recent years. With the association rule mining, we identified ranges of the six indicators for industrialization associated with good and poor air quality, respectively. Using industrialization indicators associated with poor air quality as references, we pointed out differentiated strategies for regions to coordinate the industrialization and air quality protection.",Techno-economic feasibility of anaerobic digestion of cheese whey in small Italian dairies and effect of ultrasound pre-treatment on methane yield.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31202020,Journal of environmental management,2019 06 15,"In Friuli-Venezia Giulia plain (North-East of Italy), a significant number of small diaries is present; this study was aimed at evaluating technical and economic feasibility of diffused anaerobic digestion implementation at dairy level. Different kinds of cheese whey were characterized, and biochemical methane potential tests were executed. Good methane yields (up to 437.3 NmL CH4/g VSadded) were obtained, applying an inoculum-to-substrate ratio of 6. Ultrasound pre-treatment was investigated to evaluate an eventual increase in methane production and kinetics, varying applied ultrasonic energy: significant increases in methane yield (maximum +16.0%) and CH4 production kinetics (up to +46% increase after 3 days) were obtained at low ultrasonic energy of 251.4-693.7 Wh/kg VS, while at higher ultrasonic energy of 502.8-1387.5 Wh/kg VS no significant effect was visible. Energy consumption in selected dairies was analysed, to underline the impact of anaerobic digestion implementation on electric and thermal energy need, and it was concluded that through cheese whey anaerobic digestion it is possible to cover most of the dairies energy demand. Specific electric and thermal energy consumption were evaluated to be respectively in the range of 0.009-0.133 kWh/kg milk and 0.247-0.557 MJ/kg milk, while specific energy costs were calculated as 0.0079-0.0308 €/kg milk.

The nanocomposite was characterized through BET, FTIR, FESEM, EDX, and VSM analyses. These characterizations confirmed the formation of CMGO nanocomposites with high specific surface area (152.38 m2/g) and excellent saturation magnetization (49.30 emu/g). Batch adsorption experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance of the nanocomposite in the adsorption of arsenic from aqueous solution. The effects of operational parameters, adsorption kinetic, equilibrium isotherm and thermodynamics were evaluated. The removal efficiency of arsenic increased with increasing adsorbent dosage and contact time. However, the effect of pH followed a different pattern, with the removal efficiency increasing from acidic to neutral pH, and then decreasing at alkaline conditions. The highest adsorption capacity (45 mg/g) and removal efficiency (61%) were obtained at pH 7.3. The adsorption kinetic followed a pseudo-second-order kinetic model. The analysis of adsorption isotherm shows that the adsorption data fitted well to Langmuir isotherm model, indicating a homogeneous process. Thermodynamic analysis shows that the adsorption of As(III) is exothermic and spontaneous. The superparamagnetic properties of the nanocomposite enabled the separation and recovery of the nanoparticles using an external magnetic field. Thus, the developed nanocomposite has a potential for arsenic remediation.","Monitoring of fungal root colonisation, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi diversity and soil microbial processes to assess the success of ecosystem translocation.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31202018,Journal of environmental management,2019 06 15,"To compensate for an airport expansion, including construction on valuable wet meadows of a Natura 2000 system, 1.3 ha of turf, cut into blocks, were transferred to artificial basins in a habitat garden. To evaluate the impact of translocation on this ecosystem, and thus the success of its preservation, we monitored fungal root colonisation of Molinia caerulea, the diagnostic plant species for wet meadows, along with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) species richness and composition in soils and soil microbial processes for three seasons: prior to the transfer (2013) and the two following years (2014-15). We observed few changes in the fungal colonisation of M. caerulea, suggesting that the fungal associations of this species were unaffected. The number of AMF species declined directly after the translocation; however, in 2015, an increased number of species was recorded. There were no differences in AMF species composition, nor did soil basal respiration rate, substrate-induced respiration (SIR), or substrate-active biomass (Cmic) change over the years. Only metabolic coefficient (qCO2) decreased after the transfer. The small number of effects in fungal root colonisation, AMF diversity, and microbial processes following the translocation of the ecosystem prove its success. This can be attributed to the deep turf translocation that kept the relevant microbial communities almost unaffected.",Willows for environmental projects: A literature review of results on evapotranspiration rate and its driving factors across the genus Salix.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31202017,Journal of environmental management,2019 06 15,"Willows are increasingly used for a wide range of environmental projects, including biomass production, leachate treatment, riparian buffers and treatment wetlands. Evapotranspiration (ET), assumed to be high for most willow species used in environmental projects, affects hydrological cycles and is of key interest for project managers working with willows. Here, we present a comprehensive review of ET rates provided in the literature for the genus Salix. We aim to summarize current knowledge of willow ET and analyze its variability depending on context. We compiled and analyzed data from 57 studies, covering 16 countries, 19 willow species and dozens of cultivars. We found a mean reported ET rate of 4.6 ± 4.2 mm/d, with minimum and maximum values of 0.7 and 22.7 mm/d respectively. Although results reported here varied significantly between some species, overall interspecific standard deviation (±3.6 mm/d) was similar to intraspecific variation (±3.3 mm/d) calculated for S. viminalis, suggesting a greater influence of the growing context on ET than species identity. In terms of environmental and management variables, water supply, fertilization and contamination were identified as driving factors of ET across willow species. Effects of root age, experimental context, planting density and soil type were more nuanced. Our findings provide synthetic data regarding willow ET. We encourage practitioners who use ET data from the literature to be aware of the main drivers of ET and to consider the influence of the experimental aspects of a study in order to interpret data accurately and improve project planning."

When full light intensity returns after shading, the net CO2 assimilation rate in leaves does not reach its maximum value immediately, but rises gradually over several minutes to approach a new steady state. This phenomenon has been termed photosynthetic induction, which substantially affects the efficiency of carbon fixation, and thus crop production. The significant natural variation of the speed of induction response exists among not only interspecies but also intraspecies. Recent advances in molecular analysis and high-throughput measurement techniques have revealed the genetic and eco-physiological basis of observed genetic variations in photosynthetic induction response. Here, we review the current understanding of the physiological and genetic mechanisms behind photosynthetic induction, and discusses routes to further advances.",Opportunities for the prevention of mental disorders by reducing general psychopathology in early childhood.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31202004,Behaviour research and therapy,2019 06 15,"This paper explores the concept that reducing general psychopathology early in the life course provides unprecedented opportunities to prevent the development of all forms of psychopathology later in life. We review empirical evidence for the existence of the general factor of psychopathology and theories regarding the psychological nature of the factor. We then highlight specific examples of environmental risk factors for general psychopathology and discuss translational implications for the transdiagnostic prevention of psychopathology beginning in early childhood. Ultimately, we propose a developmentally informed and transdiagnostic stepped care approach to intervention in which reduction of general psychopathology in early childhood represents the foundational step for prevention and intervention of subsequent psychopathology. This model heralds three key benefits over the current treatment zeitgeist: (1) Reducing the burden and confusion in healthcare and education systems by providing a coherent and systematic structure for early intervention across a child's development, (2) maximising the breadth of the impact of intervention by focusing on common shared risks across psychopathology, and (3) increasing the efficiency of intervention by corresponding with the development of psychopathology and leveraging the emergence of general psychopathology in early childhood.",Efficacy of an internet and app-based gratitude intervention in reducing repetitive negative thinking and mechanisms of change in the intervention's effect on anxiety and depression: Results from a randomized controlled trial.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31202003,Behaviour research and therapy,2019 06 15,"Repetitive negative thinking (RNT) has been identified as a transdiagnostic process that is involved in various forms of psychopathology, including anxiety and depression.

The secretory pathway via the ER-Golgi route - realized by a signal sequence - is referred to as ""classical secretion"". In contrast, alternative secretory pathways were summarized as ""unconventional protein secretion"". Until now, unconventional protein secretion was lacking attention due to the absence of detailed mechanistic insight and limited experimental access. However, there is a growing number of experimental data showing that a large proportion of secreted proteins is released by these alternative routes. Secretomics - the analysis of all secreted proteins of a cell population - offers the opportunity to gain more functional insight into unconventional protein secretion. Several pitfalls in secretome analysis starting with the analyzed cell model and sample preparation to data analysis have to be considered for detailed characterization of the secretome.

Proteins and proteomics,2019 06 15,"The lipase from Pseudomonas fluorescens (PFL) has been immobilized on glyoxyl-octyl agarose and compared to the enzyme immobilized on octyl-agarose. Thus, PFL was immobilized at pH 7 on glyoxyl-octyl support via lipase interfacial activation and later incubated at pH 10.5 for 20 h before reduction to get some enzyme-support covalent bonds. This permitted for 70% of the enzyme molecules to become covalently attached to the support. This biocatalyst was slightly more stable than the octyl-PFL at pH 5, 7 and 9, or in the presence of some organic solvents (stabilization factor no higher than 2). The presence of phosphate anions produced enzyme destabilization, partially prevented by the immobilization on glyoxyl-octyl (stabilization factor became 4). In contrast, the presence of calcium cations promoted a great PFLstabilization, higher in the case of the glyoxyl-octyl preparation (that remained 100% active when the octyl-PFL preparations had lost 20% of the activity). However, it is in the operational stability where the new biocatalyst showed the advantages: in the hydrolysis of 1 M triacetin in 60% 1.4 dioxane, the octyl biocatalyst released >60% of the enzyme in the first cycle, while the covalently attached enzyme retained its full activity after 5 reaction cycles.",SSCC: A Novel Computational Framework for Rapid and Accurate Clustering Large-scale Single Cell RNA-seq Data.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31202000,"Genomics, proteomics & bioinformatics",2019 06 15,"Clustering is a prevalent analytical means to analyze single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data but the rapidly expanding data volume can make this process computationally challenging. New methods for both accurate and efficient clustering are of pressing needs. Here we proposed Spearman subsampling-clustering-classification (SSCC), a new clustering framework based on random projection and feature construction, for large-scale scRNA-seq data. SSCC greatly improves clustering accuracy, robustness, and computational efficacy for various state-of-the-art algorithms benchmarked on multiple real datasets. On a dataset with 68,578 human blood cells, SSCC achieved 20% improvement for clustering accuracy and 50-fold acceleration, but only consumed 66% memory usage, compared to the widely-used software package SC3.

Self-transcribing active regulatory region sequencing (STARR-seq) measures the enhancer activity of millions of DNA fragments in parallel. Here we used STARR-seq to generate a quantitative global map of rice enhancers. Most enhancers were mapped within genes, especially at the 5' untranslated regions (5'UTR) and in coding sequences. Enhancers were also frequently mapped proximal to silent and lowly-expressed genes in transposable element (TE)-rich regions. Analysis of the epigenetic features of enhancers at their endogenous loci revealed that most enhancers do not co-localize with DNase I hypersensitive sites (DHSs) and lack the enhancer mark of histone modification H3K4me1. Clustering analysis of enhancers according to their epigenetic marks revealed that about 40% of identified enhancers carried one or more epigenetic marks. Repressive H3K27me3 was frequently enriched with positive marks, H3K4me3 and/or H3K27ac, which together label enhancers. Intergenic enhancers were also predicted based on the location of DHS regions relative to genes, which overlap poorly with STARR-seq enhancers. In summary, we quantitatively identified enhancers by functional analysis in the genome of rice, an important model plant.

Follicle selection involves diameter deviation or the beginning of separation of growth rates between F1 and F2. Diameter deviation is classified as conventional (F2 ≥ 7.0 mm when F1 is 8.5 mm or at expected deviation) and as undersized (F2 < 7.0 mm when F1 is 8.5 mm). Diameter separation of F1 and F2 in conventional and undersized deviations is characteristically abrupt and gradual, respectively. The predeviation diameter of F2 when located in an ovary that later becomes the F1 intraovarian patterns of DF-CL, devoid (ovary without a DF or CL), DF alone, or CL alone and in left or right ovaries (LO, RO) was compared between conventional and undersized deviations. In conventional deviation, ovaries with the future DF (combined DF-CL and DF patterns) were associated with greater (P < 0.02) predeviation growth rate of F2 when the DF was in the right ovary (DF/RO, 1.6 ± 0.1 mm/d) than when in the left ovary (DF/LO, 1.2 ± 0.1 mm/d). The F2 was in DF/RO more frequently (75%, P < 0.002) than in non-DF/RO. When F2 was in the future devoid F1 pattern and F1 was 6 mm, F2 was smaller (P < 0.002) in the undersized class (5.3 ± 0.2 mm) than in the conventional class (6.3 ± 0.1) but not when F2 was in one of the other future F1 patterns. Only the devoid pattern was greater in frequency (P < 0.03) in the undersized class than in the conventional class. The novel hypothesis was supported that location of F2 in ovaries with different future F1 intraovarian patterns and on different sides affects the predeviation diameter and growth rate of F2 and thereby the frequencies of conventional and undersized deviations during follicle selection.",Cilia and development.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201996,Current opinion in genetics & development,2019 06 15,"The role of mammalian cilia in cell signalling was first identified in embryonic development and subsequent analysis has revealed roles in multiple signalling pathways.

However, the influence of the oral microbiome in neurological processes is much less studied, especially in response to the stimuli, such as smoking, within the oral microenvironment. Additionally, given the complex structural and functional networks in brain, our knowledge about the relationship between microbiome and brain function through specific brain circuits is still very limited. In this pilot study, we leveraged next generation microbial sequencing with functional neuroimaging techniques to enable the delineation of microbiome-brain network links as well as their relationship to cigarette smoking. Thirty smokers and 30 age- and sex-matched nonsmokers were recruited for 16S sequencing of their oral microbial community. Among them, 56 subjects were scanned by resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging to derive brain functional networks. Statistical analyses were performed to demonstrate the influence of smoking on the oral microbial community, functional network connectivity among brain regions, and the associations between microbial shifts and the brain functional network connectivity alternations. Compared to nonsmokers, we found a significant decrease of beta diversity (P = 6 × 10-3) in smokers and identified several classes (Betaproteobacteria, Spirochaetia, Synergistia, and Mollicutes) with significant alterations in microbial abundance. Pathway analysis on the predicted KEGG pathways shows that the microbiota with altered abundance are mainly involved in pathways related to cell processes, DNA repair, immune system, and neurotransmitters signaling. One brain functional network connectivity component was identified to have a significant difference between smokers and nonsmokers (P = 0.032), mainly including connectivity between brain default network and other task-positive networks. This brain functional component was also significantly associated with smoking related oral microbiota, suggesting a related cross-individual pattern between smoking-induced oral microbiome dysbiosis and brain functional connectivity alternation, possibly involving immunological and neurotransmitter signaling pathways. This work is the first attempt to link oral microbiome and brain functional networks, and provides support for future work in characterizing the role of oral microbiome in mediating smoking effects on brain activity.",Bipolar disorder comorbidity in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder: Prevalence and predictors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201983,Journal of affective disorders,2019 06 15,"Patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) often present with comorbidities, mainly anxiety and affective disorders, which may influence OCD course, help-seeking and treatment response.

However, the chronic toxicity to TiO2 NPs of aquatic organisms has not been fully understood. In particular, research is lacking on the influence of the crystalline forms of TiO2 NPs on their mechanisms of toxicity. This study investigated the chronic toxicity (i.e., 21-day toxicity tests) of 5 types of TiO2 NPs with various percentages of crystalline forms on Daphnia magna. Results revealed that the crystalline form composed of 80% anatase and 20% rutile (i.e., the M1 form) had the highest energy band gap (i.e., Eg, the energy interval between the valence band edge and the conduction band edge) and caused maximal D. magna mortality compared with other crystalline forms. The crystalline form comprising 100% rutile (i.e., the R-S form) had the lowest Eg and exhibited a minimal effect on the physiological parameters of D. magna. Moreover, in a suitable environment without TiO2 NPs, D. magna progenies could recover to a normal physiological level (e.g., the mortalities of D. magna progenies were lower than those of parental D. magna that were exposed to TiO2 NPs at a concentration of 0.5 mg/L). Correlation analysis revealed that the body length, time of first brood, and number of neonates in the first brood of D. magna were negatively correlated with titanium accumulation in vivo. Furthermore, the indices of Ti accumulation and the product of Eg and Ti accumulation (i.e., Eg × Ti accumulation) were positively correlated (p < 0.05) with D. magna mortality, thus indicating that crystalline forms with a high Eg may cause severe toxicity to aquatic organisms at the same TiO2 bioaccumulation level.",Effects of bok choy on the dissipation of dibutyl phthalate (DBP) in mollisol and its possible mechanisms of biochemistry and microorganisms.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201960,Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,2019 06 15,"Phytoremediation is an ecologically sustainable method for remediating contaminated soils, however, research on phytoremediation and its mechanisms are still rarely reported. The highest dibutyl phthalate (DBP) dissipation rate was 91% in 0-3mm bok choy rhizosphere via a 45-day rhizo-box experiment, and bok choy could regulate soil nutrients by increasing soil ammonia nitrogen (AN) and available phosphorus (AP). The biochemistry mechanism of interaction between dissolved organic matter (DOM) and DBP was also elucidated by various spectroscopy techniques. It was found that the alkyl ester in DBP produced the fastest response during the binding process, and the aromatic, hydroxyl and phenolic groups of the DOM humic-like substances preceded amide in DOM protein-like substance. It was found that DBP pollution reduced the Chao1 richness and Shannon index of bacteria in black soil via a pot experiment and high-throughput sequencing, which disturbed the metabolic activities and functional diversity of microorganisms in Mollisol. The microbial abundance increased in bok choy amendments, which has a specific microbial community structure and a high abundance of Actinobacteria and Acidobacteria. We concluded that some enriched genera were responsible for DBP dissipation, Alsobacter, Lacibacter, Myceligenerans, Schrenkiella parvula and Undibacterium. The findings of this study revealed that the possible biochemistry and microbial mechanisms of phytoremediation promoting the DBP dissipation in rhizosphere Mollisol and provided more useful information for phytoremediation of organic pollutants.",Unstandardized UV-C dose used for killing harmful cyanobacteria may instead initiate accelerated growth in the target organisms.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201959,Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,2019 06 15,"Although UV-C radiation has been in use for killing unwanted cyanobacteria, experiments with lower doses of UV-C radiation instead showed induction of growth related parameters and enhanced biomass production in the cyanobacterium Nostoc muscorum Meg1. When the cyanobacterial cultures were exposed to UV-C radiation of varying doses (6, 12 and 18 mJ/cm2), concentrations of various photo-absorbing pigments, RuBisCO and D1 protein of PSII; activities of oxygen evolving complex, nitrogenase and glutamine synthetase were significantly increased upon 6 and 12 mJ/cm2 UV-C radiation exposures. Resulting higher photosynthetic performance was evident from the augmentation in carbohydrate content by ∼49% under single exposure to 6 mJ/cm2 UV-C by fifteenth day. The increased performances of both RuBisCO and D1 proteins were in part also due to induction at the genetic level as seen from the increase in their mRNA and protein levels under treatment. Similar increase was also observed in protein (16%) and in lipid contents (43%) that reflected an upsurge in the total biomass. Highest biomass (463 mg/L/d) was noted in culture exposed to 6 mJ/cm2 UV-C radiation, representing a ∼25% increase. Furthermore the possibility of this organism using part of the incident UV-C radiation as an additional source of energy was deduced from an experiment where the thylakoid membranes excited within UV (226-400 nm) range showed emission at longer wavelengths with an emission maximum at ∼640 nm. Thus this work provides evidence that lower UV-C doses can potentially augment cyanobacterial growth and use of unstandardized UV-C doses for restricting cyanobacterial growth may in fact produce contrary result.",Interactive effects between cadmium stabilized by palygorskite and mobilized by siderophores from Pseudomonas fluorescens.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201958,Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,2019 06 15,"The application of palygorskite (PAL) for potentially toxic trace elements (Cd2+, Ni2+, etc.) remediation in polluted soil can substantially reduce the bioavailability and toxicity of these hazard materials. However, the secretion of organic acids and siderophores by microorganisms might result in the re-mobilization of cadmium (Cd) in PAL-bound forms (PAL-Cd). In this study, the interactive effects between Cd stabilized by PAL and mobilized by siderophores from Pseudomonas fluorescens were performed with four flask-shaking experimental treatments, namely, strain with or without an ability of siderophores production respectively associated with or without PAL-Cd. The GC-MS and UHPLC-MS test methods were used to analyze the concentrations of metabolites. Results showed that the Cd mobilized by strain with siderophores production was 22.1% higher than that of strain without the ability of siderophores production (p < 0.05). The mobilization of Cd in PAL in turn significantly reduced the siderophores production of Pseudomonas fluorescens by 25.1% (p < 0.05). The numbers of metabolites significantly up-regulated and down-regulated were 9 and 22 in strain groups with PAL-Cd addition compared with the groups without PAL-Cd, respectively. Metabolomics analysis revealed that the mobilized Cd affects the signal transduction pathway and primary metabolic processes, reduces the metabolic capacity of pentose phosphate pathway, glycolysis and tricarboxylic acid cycle pathway. These changes inhibit the ability of strain to biosynthesize amino acids during the mobilization processes, further reducing the capacity of Pseudomonas fluorescens to produce siderophores. This study provides a useful information on how to select soil Cd-stabilizing materials in a targeted manner and how to avoid Cd re-mobilization by siderophores.",Differential plasma postprandial lipidomic responses to krill oil and fish oil supplementations in women: A randomized crossover study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201957,"Nutrition (Burbank, Los Angeles County, Calif.)",2019 06 15,There is no convincing evidence that krill oil (KO) consumption results in a higher incorporation of long chain ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids into blood lipid fractions than fish oil (FO).

Here, we investigated the effects of MMI on AhR-CYP1A pathway in human hepatocytes and HepaRG cells derived from human progenitor hepatic cells. All MMI, except of 2-methylindole, strongly induced CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 mRNAs in HepaRG cells. Induction of CYP1A genes was absent in AhR-knock-out HepaRG cells. Consistently, CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 mRNAs and proteins were induced by all MMIs (except 2-methylindole), in human hepatocytes. The enzyme activity of CYP1A1 was inhibited by MMIs in human hepatocytes and LS180 colon cancer cells in a concentration-dependent manner (IC50 values from 1.2 μM to 23.8 μM and from 3.4 μM to 11.4 μM, respectively). Inhibition of CYP1A1 activity by MMI in human liver microsomes was much weaker as compared to that in intact cells. Incubation of parental MMI with human hepatocytes either diminished (4-methylindole, 6-methylindole) or enhanced (7-methylindole) their agonist effects on AhR in AZ-AHR reporter cells. In conclusion, overall effects of MMI on AhR-CYP1A pathway in human cells comprise the induction of CYP1A genes through AhR, the inhibition of CYP1A catalytic activity and possibly the metabolic transformation causing loss or gain of AhR agonist activity of parental compounds.",Improved prognosis and increased tumor infiltrating lymphocytes in small cell lung cancer patients with neurologic paraneoplastic syndromes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201935,Journal of thoracic oncology : official publication of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer,2019 06 15,"Approximately 10% of patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) develop a paraneoplastic syndrome (PNS).

Feasibility and prospects.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201931,Microbes and infection,2019 06 15,"Sporotrichosis is an emergent subcutaneous mycosis of humans and some animals caused by dimorphic fungi of the genus Sporothrix. The disease occurs worldwide but is endemic or hyperendemic in tropical and subtropical areas. The epidemiology of the disease is changing dramatically, and it is now considered an important zoonosis with high morbidity rates, principally in Brazil, and an opportunistic infection in immunocompromised patients. Due to the limited options currently available to treat invasive fungal infections, including sporotrichosis, and the emergence of drug resistance and toxicity, the development of anti-Sporothrix vaccines has become an area of great interest. This work provides a brief analysis of the feasibility of the development of prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines against sporotrichosis, future challenges and prospects.",Expression pattern of ABCDE model genes in floral organs of bolting garlic clone.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201930,Gene expression patterns : GEP,2019 06 15,"A correct understanding of the ABCDE model genes expression, especially genes involved in the development of the reproductive floral organs, in bolting and fertile garlic clones improves the process of its fertilization and breeding programs. Therefore, Real-Time PCR was employed to evaluate the temporal and spatial expression patterns of some floral organ identity genes in the inflorescence and different floret organs in the two stages of green and purple florets of bolting garlic clone. Relative expression of the studied genes, except AsSTK, in the mature inflorescence increased significantly during the early stages of initiation and differentiation of floral organs. Relative expression of the AsAP1 in the tepal and carpel, and AsAP2 in the tepal, stamen and carpel increased significantly. The highest relative expression levels of the AsAP1 and AsAP2 were found in the tepal of green florets and in the carpel of purple florets, respectively. AsAP3 and AsPI expression increased significantly in the stamen and carpel, and the highest relative expression of these two genes were observed in the green floret tepal. Relative expression of the AsAG increased significantly only in the reproductive floral organs and decreased significantly both in the carpel and stamen at floret maturity. The AsSEP1, 3 were expressed in all floral organs, but the AsSTK was only expressed in the carpel and its relative expression increased significantly at floret maturity. Finally, since considerable expression levels of the above genes were observed in the floral organs, these genes seem to be influential in the formation of floral organs in bolting garlic.",Acrolein-mediated alpha-synuclein pathology involvement in the early post-injury pathogenesis of mild blast-induced Parkinsonian neurodegeneration.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201929,Molecular and cellular neurosciences,2019 06 15,"Survivors of blast-induced traumatic brain injury (bTBI) have increased susceptibility to Parkinson's disease (PD), characterized by α-synuclein aggregation and the progressive degeneration of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons. Using an established bTBI rat model, we evaluated the changes of α-synuclein and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), known hallmarks of PD, and acrolein, a reactive aldehyde and marker of oxidative stress, with the aim of revealing key pathways leading to PD post-bTBI. Indicated in both animal models of PD and TBI, acrolein is likely a point of pathogenic convergence. Here we show that after a single mild bTBI, acrolein is elevated up to a week, systemically in urine, and in whole brain tissue, specifically the substantia nigra and striatum. Acrolein elevation is accompanied by heightened α-synuclein oligomerization, dopaminergic dysregulation, and acrolein/α-synuclein interaction in the same brain regions. We further show that acrolein can directly modify and oligomerize α-synuclein in vitro. Taken together, our data suggests acrolein likely plays an important role in inducing PD pathology following bTBI by encouraging α-synuclein aggregation. These results are expected to advance our understanding of the long-term post-bTBI pathological changes leading to the development of PD, and suggest intervention targets to curtail such pathology.",Fear-context association during memory retrieval requires input from granular to dysgranular retrosplenial cortex.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201928,Neurobiology of learning and memory,2019 06 15,"The contribution of the granular (area 29, A29) and dysgranular (area 30, A30) subdivisions of the retrosplenial cortex (RSC) to contextual fear memory (CFM) retrieval remains elusive. Here, intact and orchiectomized (ORC) male rats received an intraperitoneal (I.P.) injection of saline (control) or 5 mg/Kg MK801 after training and memory formation. In ORC, but not in intact males, this MK801 treatment selectively induces overt loss of neurons in layers IV-Va of A29 (A29MK801 neurons) (Sigwald et al., 2016). Compared to ORC-saline, ORC-MK801 rats showed impaired CFM retrieval in an A-B-A design for contextual fear conditioning (CFC), however context recognition was not affected. In ORC-MK801 rats, neither novel object recognition nor object-in-context discrimination were impaired, further indicating that A29MK801 neurons are not required for contextual recognition. Elevated plus maze test showed that anxiety-like behavior was not affected in ORC-MK801 animals, suggesting that loss of A29MK801 neurons does not affect the emotional state that could impair freezing during test. Importantly, in a sensory preconditioning test, higher order CFM retrieval was abolished in ORC-MK801, but not in male-MK801. Collectively, these observations indicate that A29MK801 neurons are critically required for retrieving fear-context association. For dissecting the anatomofunctional contribution of A29MK801 neurons to CFM retrieval, expression of c-Fos and Egr-1 was used to map brain-wide neuronal activity. In control male rats CFC and CFM retrieval was associated with significant enhancement of both proteins in limbic structures and A30, but not in A29, suggesting that neurons in A30 and limbic structures encode and store the associative experience. Notably, in ORC but not in intact males, MK801 impairs CFM retrieval and expression of c-Fos and Egr-1 proteins in A30, without affecting their expression in limbic structures. Thus, the loss of A29MK801 neurons after CFM formation precludes activation of associative neurons in A30, impairing CFM recall. FluoroGold retrograde track-tracing confirmed that A29MK801 neurons project to A30. Silver staining provide evidence that MK801 in ORC rats induces axonal deafferentation of A29MK801 neuron in A30. Collectively, our experiments provide the first evidence that A30 neurons participate in encoding and storing CFM while A29 is required for their activation during recall."

These adsorbent nanoparticles were prepared by in situ formation of magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (MIONs) coupled with CSM mucilage and benefited from the advantages of both CSM and MIONs. The CSM-MIONs adsorbent exhibited a great dye adsorption capacity along with a strong magnetic character. The effect of various experimental parameters were studied on the adsorption performance of CSM-MIONs including pH, ionic strength, initial dye concentration, contact time and temperature. The adsorbent nanoparticles were characterized by FTIR, FESEM, XRD, DLS, and VSM techniques. Thermodynamic analysis indicated that the studied dye adsorption process has a spontaneous and exothermic nature. The equilibrium adsorption data were in agreement with the Langmuir kinetic model (R2 > 0.99) and described by the pseudo-second-order Langmuir equation (R2 > 0.98). It was revealed that intraparticle diffusion is not the only rate controlling factor. The CSM-MIONs adsorbents could be well regenerated using an acid solution, and showed high adsorption capability even after five desorption-adsorption cycles. The obtained results showed that the CSM-MIONs can potentially be used as a high-performance low cost adsorbent in wastewater treatment.",A flaxseed heteropolysaccharide stimulates immune responses and inhibits hepatitis B virus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201916,International journal of biological macromolecules,2019 06 15,"A novel heteropolysaccharide defined as FP-1 was enriched from flaxseed hull through hot water extraction (boiling water, 2 h, twice) followed by ion-exchange and size exclusion chromatography.

The chemical and physical properties of all native chitosan and its modified products were determined by Fourier transform spectroscopy (FTIR), ninhydrin assay, Folin-Ciocalteu reagent procedure, thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), high performance of liquid chromatography (HPLC), X-ray diffraction (XRD), water solubility and antioxidant property (both DPPH assay and reducing power assay). Results showed that the water solubility and antioxidant property of modified product decreases, when molecular weight of corresponding native chitosan increases. The obtained modified product had good solubility over a wide range of pH.

CS was treated with sodium nitrate and subsequent crosslinking reaction with DPC for the preparation of DPCCS. Different techniques were used for characterization of DPCCS. Various parameters such as, temperature, pH, and concentration of Cu(II) were used for adsorption studies. Kinetics of Cu(II) ion on DPCCS follows the Pseudo second order and equilibrium of adsorption occurs in short time. The equilibrium data was best fitted with the Langmuir isotherm and the maximum adsorption capacity of DPCCS was 185.505 mg g-1. Thermodynamic parameters ΔG°, ΔH° and ΔS° suggested that the adsorption of Cu(II) ion on the surfaces of DPCCS was spontaneous, endothermic and randomness of Cu(II) ion in the solution was enhanced respectively.

Thus, the reduction of the molecular mass could increase applications of these biopolymers. Therefore, the EPS production of different rhizobia and the action of xanthan lyase on its structures were evaluated. The strains produced significant amounts of EPS, and it was noticed that are heteropolysaccharides, composed galactose and glucose. Both EPS and xanthan were modified on β-glycosidic bonds, the mannose was removed of xanthan had but the EPS was affected in the CO stretching vibration, where the glucuronic acid removed from of your structure. The ester/carboxylic acid portions affected functional groups of the acetate/succinate, methyl carbons of the O-acetyl and pyruvate methyl groups in addition to affect the carbons the main pyranoid. The Resistance to temperature increase of the EPS was observed, made possible by the activity of the lyase. EPS has the ability to form stable gels at higher temperatures and anionic feature can be used on solubilization and controlled release of substances.

The surface morphology and elemental composition of chitosan/WASC beads were characterized using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). Adsorption isotherms of Cu(II) ions on adsorbents were correlated with the Langmuir and Freundlich models, and the data fitted better to the Freundlich isotherm model. The kinetic data were evaluated to calculate the theoretical metal uptake as a function of time. The highest correlation coefficient (R2) was calculated with the pseudo-second order kinetic model for the adsorption.

The use of this drug is also limited due to multi-drug resistance. In this study polysaccharide nanoparticles are used in the delivery of chemotherapeutic drug while minimizing side-effects, solubility issues and drug resistance. The use of biopolymers like galactoxyloglucan to synthesize nanoparticle makes it more biocompatible. This study involves the synthesis of PST-PTX nanoparticles using tamarind seed polysaccharide and Paclitaxel by epichlorohydrin crosslinking. The particles were further characterized by Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS), High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) and UV-Visible spectroscopy. The cytotoxicity of PST-PTX nanoparticles in cancer cell lines and resistant cancer cell lines were determined by MTT assay. The quantitative analysis of cell death was determined by Annexin V dead cell assay, Caspase 3/7 assay and expression of pro-apoptotic protein Bax. The ability of the nanoparticle to overcome multi-drug resistance was evaluated by the expression of multidrug-resistant proteins P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and Breast cancer resistant protein (BCRP) in lung adenocarcinoma resistant cells (A549R). The present study provides evidence for the ability of PST-PTX nanoparticle to overcome multi-drug resistance and cause apoptotic cell death.

In our hospital, analytical QC process intended to mabs identification and quantification is based on flow injection analysis (FIA) associated with second derivative UV spectroscopy and matching method algorithm. We studied the influence of degraded mabs after compounding on this validated QC. Three forced stress conditions including mechanical, thermal and freeze-thawing stresses were studied to yield degraded mabs from two model compounds, i.e., bevacizumab (IgG1) and nivolumab (IgG4). Different degraded mabs were generated and were analyzed in terms of turbidity, the percentage of aggregation, size distribution, and changes in tertiary structure. Stresses showed to be mab-dependent in terms of aggregation. Tertiary structural changes were observed in most of the stressed samples by principal component analysis (PCA) of the UV second derivative data. The structural and physicochemical modifications conducted to mismatch depending on the nature of the stress. The mismatch ranged from 17 % to 72 % for the mabs, except for freeze-thawed bevacizumab for which a perfect match (100 %) was reached. The quantification with an unfulfilled relative error of the concentration (i.e., > ± 15 %) was detected only for mechanically stressed mabs. In conclusion, the study revealed that the influence of the mabs and the type of stress impact on the QC of compounded mabs.",Hybrid nanostructured films for topical administration of simvastatin as coadjuvant treatment of melanoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201905,Journal of pharmaceutical sciences,2019 06 15,"This work aims at (i) assessing the potential of repurposing simvastatin (SV) to support the most common therapies against melanoma, and (ii) developing an innovative topical adhesive film, composed by chitosan coated nanostructured lipid carriers (Ch-NLC) used as drug vehicle. A factorial design approach was employed as the basis for the formulation development. Optimized Ch-NLC displayed a particle size of 108±1 nm, a polydispersity index of 0.226, a zeta potential of 17.0±0.6 mV, as well as an entrapment efficiency of 99.86±0.08%, and SV loading of 14.99±0.01%. The performance of SV-Ch-NLC films was assessed in terms of release, permeation and adhesion, as critical quality attributes. Cutaneous tolerability and in vitro cytotoxicity studies were performed to warrant film safety and drug effectiveness, respectively. The topical films provided a sustained release kinetic profile of SV and were classified as non-irritant systems. The encapsulation of SV increased cytotoxicity in melanoma cells. The key role of squalene as nanostructuring agent of the lipid nanoparticle matrix, and as permeation enhancer was highlighted, suggesting its key action for potentiating skin permeation and uptake into melanoma cells. Topical SV-Ch-NLC films are thus, able to provide an in situ extended drug delivery, useful as coadjuvant treatment of melanoma skin lesions.","Nanostructured Lipid Carriers for oral bioavailability enhancement of Exemestane: Formulation design, in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo studies.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201904,Journal of pharmaceutical sciences,2019 06 15,"Exemestane (EXE), a novel oral steroidal aromatase inhibitor, approved for the treatment of breast cancer.

In contrast, unconditional strategies such as ALLD and ALLC also unilaterally set a linear payoff relationship. Errors often happen between players in the real world. However, little is known about the existence of such strategies in the RPD game with errors. Here, we analytically search for all strategies that enforce a linear payoff relationship under observation errors in the RPD game. As a result, we found that, even in the case with observation errors, the only strategy sets that enforce a linear payoff relationship are either ZD strategies or unconditional strategies and that no other strategies can enforce it, which were numerically confirmed."

Adult-born granule cells are known to improve learning and memory at about 3-6 weeks post mitosis by enhancing the brains ability to discriminate similar memory items. However, the underlying mechanisms are still controversial. Here we review the distinct functional properties of the newborn young neurons, including enhanced excitability, reduced GABAergic inhibition, NMDA-receptor dependent electrogenesis and enhanced synaptic plasticity. Although these cellular properties provide a competitive advantage for synapse formation, they do not generate 'hyperactivity' of young neurons. By contrast, in vivo evidence from immediate early gene expression and calcium imaging indicates that young neurons show sparse activity during learning. Similarly, in vitro data show a low number of high-impact synapses, leading to activation young cells by distinct subsets of afferent fibers with minimal overlap. Overall, the enhanced excitability of young cells does not generate hyperactivity but rather counterbalance the low number of excitatory input synapses. Finally, sparse coding in young neurons has been shown to be crucial for neurogenesis-dependent improvement of learning behavior. Taken together, converging evidence from cell physiology and behavioral studies suggests a mechanism that can explain the beneficial effects of adult neurogenesis on brain function.","Avian influenza in the Greater Mekong Subregion, 2003-2018.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201870,"Infection, genetics and evolution : journal of molecular epidemiology and evolutionary genetics in infectious diseases",2019 06 15,"The persistent circulation of avian influenza viruses (AIVs) is an ongoing problem for many countries in South East Asia, causing large economic losses to both the agricultural and health sectors.

The formation and number of nodules in legumes are precisely controlled by a rhizobia-induced signal cascade and host-controlled autoregulation of nodulation (AON). However, how these pathways are integrated and their underlying mechanisms are unclear. Here, we report that the microRNA172c (miR172c) activates soybean (Glycine max) Rhizobia-Induced CLE1 (GmRIC1) and GmRIC2 by removing the transcriptional repression of these genes by soybean Nodule Number Control 1 (NNC1), thereby activating the AON pathway. NNC1 interacts with GmNINa, the soybean ortholog of Lotus NODULE INCEPTION (NIN) and hampers its transcriptional activation of GmRIC1 and GmRIC2. Importantly, GmNINa acts as a transcriptional activator of miR172c. Intriguingly, NNC1 can transcriptionally repress miR172c expression, introducing a novel negative feedback loop into the NNC1 regulatory network. Moreover, GmNINa interacts with NNC1 and can relieve the NNC1-mediated repression of miR172c transcription. Thus, the GmNINa/miR172c/NNC1 network is a master switch that coordinately regulates and optimizes NF and AON signaling, supporting the balance between nodulation and AON in soybean.",Crevice Corrosion - A Newly Observed Mechanism of Degradation in Biomedical Magnesium.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201866,Acta biomaterialia,2019 06 15,"Crevice-induced corrosion is not desirable to occur in metallic magnesium (Mg) during many industrial applications. However, orthopedic implants made of Mg alloys have been demonstrated to degrade faster between the joining surface of bone plates and screws after implantation, suggesting the crevice corrosion may occur in the physiological environment. In this paper, a resin device is designed to parallel high purity magnesium (HP-Mg) plates with closely spaced slits. After a standard corrosion test in the phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution, the paralleled HP-Mg samples embedded in the custom-made resin device corrode faster than those without the resin device. The corrosion morphology of Mg with the resin device exhibits features of crevice corrosion with many deep holes and river-like texture. Moreover, implantation of the bone plate and screws in vivo demonstrates similar corrosion morphology as that of the in vitro test, suggesting the occurrence of crevice-enhanced corrosion in the bone-bone plate interface, as well as the contact area between the bone plate and the screws. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Understanding corrosion behavior of Mg and Mg alloys after implantation is one of the main challenges for developing desirable biodegradable Mg alloys or effective methods to adjust the corrosion rate of Mg-based implants. In this paper, we attempted to figure out the corrosion behaviors of HP-Mg at the joining surface between HP-Mg plates or HP-Mg screws and bone tissues after implantation. We designed an in vitro setup to mimic crevice environment of in vivo joining surface and found the existed crevices on the HP-Mg would significantly accelerate the corrosion rate and change the corrosion morphology of HP-Mg plates. The in vivo implantation also showed similar corrosion morphology caused by crevice corrosion appeared at the joining surface between HP-Mg plates or HP-Mg screws and bone tissues. Then, we proposed a new crevice corrosion explanation of Mg-based alloys. Our finding can help us broaden our cognition to the corrosion behavior of Mg and Mg alloys orthopedic implants.","A polyherbal formulation, HC9 regulated cell growth and expression of cell cycle and chromatin modulatory proteins in breast cancer cell lines.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201865,Journal of ethnopharmacology,2019 06 15,"HC9, a polyherbal formulation, is based upon a traditional Ayurvedic formulation, Stanya Shodhana Kashaya (SSK, having 10 plant materials), formulated on Stanyashodhana gana, explained by Charaka in Charakasaṃhita Sutrasthana IV and mentioned in other texts as well.

We conclude that not all hiPSC-CMs are suitable for drug testing in terms of cardiac safety assessment, and pre-set acceptance criteria need to be established before any hiPSC-CMs can be used in CiPA-style study to evaluate cardiac liabilities of drug candidates.",Pulmonary Complications in Pediatric and Adolescent Patients Following Allogeneic Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201861,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,2019 06 15,"Pulmonary complications after hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) can lead to significant morbidity and mortality. Limited evaluation of the true incidence of these complications in children and subsequent outcomes of these complications has not been recently evaluated. In April of 2018, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), and the National Cancer Institute (NCI) co-sponsored a meeting of experts to describe the status of pulmonary complications in children after HCT, to identify critical gaps in knowledge, to explore avenues for research, advance care and optimize outcomes. The Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) was used to evaluate the cumulative incidence of pulmonary complications in children and their respective survival. 5,022 children received allogeneic HCT from 2010-2016 were included in this analysis and 606 developed pulmonary complications within the first year after HCT. Pneumonitis occurred in 388 patients, 125 patients developed pulmonary hemorrhage, and 200 patients developed lung graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). For those developing pulmonary complications within one year, overall survival 100 days after diagnosis of pulmonary complications was 49% (95% CI 43-54%) for patients with pneumonitis, 23% (95% CI 16-31%) in patients with pulmonary hemorrhage, and 87% (95% CI 81-91%) in patients with pulmonary GVHD.

However, its molecular mechanism is poorly understood. Here, we show that DNA damage induces nonselective and selective autophagy in budding yeast. DNA damage caused the attenuation of TORC1 activity, dephosphorylation of Atg13, and autophagy induction. The TORC1-upstream Rag GTPase Gtr1 was not required for TORC1 inactivation and autophagy induction after DNA damage. Furthermore, DNA damage responsive protein kinases Mec1/ATM and Tel1/ATR, and stress-responsive mitogen-activated protein kinase Mpk1/Slt2 were required for the full induction of autophagy.

We earlier proposed generalized concentration addition (GCA) to deal with the inability of CA to estimate effects of mixtures above the level of the least efficacious component. GCA requires specifying mathematical concentration response functions for each mixture component that must be invertible, yielding real numbers. We construct concentration response functions using pharmacodynamic models of ligand-receptor interaction, an important molecular initiating event for adverse outcome pathways. Here, we extend our earlier work in two novel ways. First, we show how composite functions can be used to extend these predictions to downstream events. Second, we show that GCA can accommodate not only receptors with single binding sites but also receptors that bind ligand at each monomer and then dimerize. The derived concentration response functions for receptors that homodimerize meet the requirements for using GCA.",The neuroprotection of liraglutide on diabetic cognitive deficits is associated with improved hippocampal synapses and inhibited neuronal apoptosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201846,Life sciences,2019 06 15,"Diabetes mellitus can cause cognitive impairments, a state between normal aging and dementia.

The absence in anencephaly of the forebrain and skull bones determines the exposure to the amniotic fluid of the remaining brain tissue and the spinal cord, causing the degeneration of the nervous system tissue. Based on the previously achieved information related to the direct alteration of neural development with deficient concentration of several GGs, a systematic and comparative mass spectrometry (MS) mapping assay on GGs originating from fetuses in different intrauterine developmental stages, i.e. the 29th (denoted An29), 35th (An35) and the 37th (An37) gestational weeks was here conducted. Our approach, based on Orbitrap MS under high sensitivity, resolution and mass accuracy conditions, enabled for the first time the nanoelectrospray ionization, detection and identification of over 150 glycoforms, mainly novel, polysialylated species. Such a pattern, specific for incipient developmental stages reliably documents the brain development stagnation, characteristic for anencephaly. Further, the fragmentation MS2-MS3 experiments by collision induced dissociation (CID) confirmed the incidence in all three samples of GT2(d18:1/16:2) as a potential biomarker. Therefore, this fingerprinting of the anencephalic gangliosidome may serve in development of approaches for routine screening and early diagnosis.",Overexpression of CKIP-1 alleviates hypoxia-induced cardiomyocyte injury by up-regulating Nrf2 antioxidant signaling via Keap1 inhibition.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201843,Biochimie,2019 06 15,"Acute myocardial infarction causes irreversible myocardial damage and is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide. Casein kinase 2 interacting protein-1 (CKIP-1) has been suggested to confer cytoprotection against various pathologic injuries. However, it remains unclear whether CKIP-1 regulates myocardial infarction-induced cardiomyocyte injury. This study aimed to explore the potential role of CKIP-1 in regulating hypoxia-induced cardiomyocyte injury and reveal the underlying mechanism. The results demonstrated that hypoxia-exposed cardiomyocytes showed lower CKIP-1 expression. CKIP-1 restoration by transfecting a CKIP-1 expression vector significantly improved viability and reduced apoptosis in hypoxia-treated cardiomyocytes. Moreover, CKIP-1 overexpression suppressed hypoxia-induced oxidative stress in cardiomyocytes. Mechanism research revealed that CKIP-1 overexpression reduced the expression of kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) and increased the nuclear translocation of nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), actions which resulted in an increase in the transcription of Nrf2 target genes. However, Keap1 overexpression partially reversed CKIP-1-mediated Nrf2 promotion and cardioprotection. Notably, the blockade of Nrf2 signaling also significantly abolished CKIP-1-mediated cardioprotection. Overall, our findings demonstrate that CKIP-1 alleviates hypoxia-induced cardiomyocyte injury through the up-regulation of Nrf2 antioxidant signaling via the down-regulation of Keap1, suggesting a potential role for CKIP-1 in myocardial infarction.",Three new C23 steroids from the leaves and stems of Nicandra physaloides.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201842,Steroids,2019 06 15,"Nicandra physaloides is a medicinal and edible plant and has been used as traditionally herbal medicine to treat various diseases in folk.

Thus, to further find bioactive steroids, the stems and leaves of N. physaloides were investigated and three new C23 steroids, nic-physatones I-J (1-2), and nic-physatone S (3), together with a known C25 steroid, nic 17 (4), were isolated. Their structures were elucidated by extensive 1D NMR and 2D NMR (HSQC, HMBC, 1H-1H COSY, and ROESY), UV and MS analyses. Compounds 1-3 possess a rare C23 steroid skeleton.

Here, we took up this challenge in an attempt to distinguish between two competing accounts of the problem size effect (PSE), a robust finding in investigations of mathematical cognition. The PSE occurs when people solve arithmetic problems and indicates that numerically large problems are solved more slowly and erroneously than small problems. Neurocognitive explanations for the PSE can be categorized into representation-based and process-based views. Behavioral and traditional univariate neural measures have struggled to distinguish between these accounts. By contrast, a representational similarity analysis (RSA) approach with fMRI data provides competing hypotheses that can distinguish between accounts without recourse to reverse inference. To that end, our RSA (but not univariate) results provided clear evidence in favor of the representation-based over the process-based account of the PSE in multiplication; for addition, the results were less clear. Post-hoc similarity analysis distinguished still further between competing representation-based theoretical accounts. Namely, data favored the notion that individual multiplication problems are stored as individual memory traces sensitive to input frequency over a strictly magnitude-based account of memory encoding. Together, these results provide an example of how human neuroimaging evidence can directly inform cognitive-level explanations of a common behavioral phenomenon, the problem size effect. More broadly, these data may expand our understanding of calculation and memory systems in general.","pink1, atp13a2 and uchl1 Expressions Are Affected by Inflammation in the Brain.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201839,Neuroscience letters,2019 06 15,"In Parkinson's disease (PD), several genes have been identified as the PD-related genes, however, the regulatory mechanisms of these gene expressions have not been fully identified. In this study, we investigated the effect of inflammation, one of the major risk factors in PD on expressions of the PD-related genes. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was intraperitoneally administered to mature male zebrafish and gene expressions in the brains were examined by real-time PCR. In the inflammation-related genes, expressions of tnfb, il1b and il6 were increased at 2 days post administration in the 10 μg group, and tnfb expression was also increased at 4 days post administration in the 1 μg and 10 μg group. In the PD-related genes, pink1 expression was significantly decreased at 4 days, atp13a2 expression was significantly increased at 7 days, and uchl1 expression was significantly decreased at 7 days. This suggests that pink1, atp13a2 and uchl1 expressions are regulated by inflammation, and this regulatory mechanism might be involved in the progress of PD.",Visualizing protein motion in Couette flow by all-atom molecular dynamics.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201838,Biochimica et biophysica acta. General subjects,2019 06 15,"In living cells, biomacromolecules are exposed to a highly crowded environment. The cytoplasm, the nucleus, and other organelles are highly viscous fluids that differ from dilute in vitro conditions. Viscosity, a measure of fluid internal friction, directly affects the forces that act on immersed macromolecules. Although active motion of this viscous fluid - cytoplasmic streaming - occurs in many plant and animal cells, the effect of fluid motion (flow) on biomolecules is rarely discussed. Recently NMR experiments that apply a shearing flow in situ have been used for protein studies. While these NMR experiments have succeeded in spectroscopically tracking protein aggregation in real time, they do not provide a visual picture of protein motion under shear. To fill this gap, here we have used molecular dynamics simulations to study the motion of three proteins of different size and shape in a simple shearing flow. The proteins exhibit a superposition of random diffusion and shear-flow-induced rotational motion. Random rotational diffusion dominates at lower shear stresses, whereas an active ""rolling motion"" along the axis of the applied flow occurs at higher shear stress. Even larger shear stresses perturb protein secondary structure elements resulting in local and global unfolding. Apart from shear-induced unfolding, our results imply that, in an ideal Couette flow field biomolecules undergo correlated motion, which should enhance the probability of inter-molecular interaction and aggregation. Connecting biomolecular simulation with experiments applying shear flow in situ appears to be a promising strategy to study protein alignment, deformation, and dynamics under shear."

One of the problems regarding the automatic diagnosis of sleep patterns is extraction and selection of discriminative features generally demanding high computational burden. This paper provides a new single-channel approach to automatic classification of sleep stages from EEG signal. The main idea is to directly apply the raw EEG signal to deep convolutional neural network, without involving feature extraction/selection, which is a challenging process in the previous literature. The proposed network architecture includes 9 convolutional layers followed by 2 fully connected layers. In order to make the samples of different classes balanced, we used a preprocessing method called data augmentation. The simulation results of the proposed method for classification of 2 to 6 classes of sleep stages show the accuracy of 98.10%, 96.86%, 93.11%, 92.95%, 93.55% and Cohen's Kappa coefficient of 0.98%, 0.94%, 0.90%, 0.86% and 0.89%, respectively.

Natural products still play an important role in drug discovery. In the present study, derivatives of a natural product, oleanolic acid, were screened with myoblast differentiation and myotube atrophy assays, respectively. Results revealed that one of the derivatives, HA-19 showed the most potent anti-muscle atrophy activity, and was used for further studies. We demonstrated that HA-19 led to the increase of the protein synthesis by activating mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1)/p70 S6K pathways, and also enhanced myoblast proliferation and terminal differentiation via up-regulating of the myogenic transcription factors Pax7, MyoD and Myogenin. The interesting thing was that HA-19 also suppressed protein degradation to prevent myotube atrophy by down-regulating negative growth factors, FoxO1, MuRF1 and Atrogin-1. The results were also supported by puromycin labelling and protein ubiquitination assays. These data revealed that HA-19 possessed a ""dual effect"" on inhibition of muscle atrophy. In disuse-induced muscle atrophy mice model, HA-19 treatment significantly increased the weights of bilateral tibialis anterior (TA), gastrocnemius (Gastroc.), quadriceps (Quad.), suggesting the effectiveness of HA-19 to remit disuse-induced muscle atrophy.

MC-LR-induced cell death is critically involved in its potent specific hepatotoxicity. Many studies have demonstrated that prototypical apoptosis as a form of programmed cell death after MC-LR is associated with liver injury. However, whether another form of programmed cell death exists and the underlying mechanism have not been reported. Here, we demonstrate that MC-LR can induce necroptosis via ROS overactivation in primary mouse hepatocytes. Various potential pathways of programmed cell death induced by MC-LR were evaluated by annexin V/PI dual staining for flow cytometric analysis, image-based PI staining analysis and western blot analysis. Cell viability was determined by the CCK8 assay. Rupture of the plasma membrane was indicated by lactate dehydrogenase release. ROS was evaluated with the carboxy-H2DCFDA fluorescent probe. It was found that in MC-LR-treated cells, as the plasma membrane was damaged, annexin V/PI-stained double-positive cells were significantly induced and PI-stained nuclei were more diffuse. Western blot analysis showed that MC-LR treatment significantly upregulated the expression of necroptotic and apoptotic proteins. Mechanistically, MC-LR induced ROS overproduction by dysregulating the expression and activity of the pro-oxidants SOD1, MAOA, and NOX4 and the antioxidant GPX1. These results indicate the presence of a novel mechanism for MC-LR-mediated liver injury and present a novel target in the treatment of MC-LR-exposed patients.",Head-to-head comparison of plasma cTnI concentration values measured with three high-sensitivity methods in a large Italian population of healthy volunteers and patients admitted to emergency department with acute coronary syndrome: A multi-center study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201817,Clinica chimica acta; international journal of clinical chemistry,2019 06 15,The study aim is to compare cTnI values measured with three high-sensitivity (hs) methods in apparently healthy volunteers and patients admitted to emergency department (ED) with acute coronary syndrome enrolled in a large multicentre study.,Barricor blood collection tubes are equivalent to PST for a variety of chemistry and immunoassay analytes except for lactate dehydrogenase.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201816,Clinica chimica acta; international journal of clinical chemistry,2019 06 15,"The BD Barricor tube uses a novel mechanical separator designed to eliminate gel artifacts, decrease cellular contamination, and improve stability.

As the renewal and regeneration of OLGs derived from oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) are inhibited by various pathological conditions, the restoration of impaired oligodendrogenesis is a therapeutic strategy for OLG-related diseases such as subcortical ischemic vascular dementia (SIVD). Fingolimod (FTY720), a drug for multiple sclerosis, is reported to elicit a cytoprotective effect on OPCs in vitro. However, the effects of fingolimod against ischemia-induced suppression of OPC differentiation remain unknown. Hence, the purpose of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of fingolimod against ischemia-induced suppression of oligodendrogenesis. For the in vitro experiments, primary rat cultured OPCs were incubated with a non-lethal concentration of CoCl2 to induce chemical hypoxic conditions and were treated with or without fingolimod-phosphate. We found that low concentration fingolimod-phosphate directly rescued ischemia-induced suppression of OPC differentiation via the phosphoinositide 3-kinase-Akt pathway. For the in vivo experiments, we used a mouse model of SIVD generated by bilateral common carotid artery stenosis. On day 28 after surgery, fingolimod ameliorated ischemia-induced demyelination and promoted oligodendrogenesis under prolonged cerebral hypoperfusion. The present study demonstrates that fingolimod can promote oligodendrogenesis under ischemic conditions and may be a therapeutic candidate for SIVD.",Mesenchymal stem cells derived from induced pluripotent stem cells play a key role in immunomodulation during cardiopulmonary resuscitation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201814,Brain research,2019 06 15,/Aims Previous in vitro experiments have demonstrated the immunomodulatory functions of mesenchymal stem cells derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC-MSCs) in brain injury.

Recent studies revealed that SIRT1 might function as a tumor suppressor during the progression of RCC. In addition, studies showed that FGB expression was abnormally upregulated in RCC and related to the progress of RCC. This study aimed to define the function of SIRT1 and underlying mechanism in the RCC progression. The expression of SIRT1 and FGB in RCC specimens and cells were detected by immunoblotting and immunostaining. Luciferase reporter assay was performed to confirm FGB as the target gene of STAT3. Other methods including stable transfection, co-immunoprecipitation, Western blot, and in vitro and in vivo proliferation assays were also performed. Our results showed that SIRT1 expression was downregulated in RCC tissues compared to adjacent normal tissues and relatively high expression of SIRT1 conferred a better prognosis for patients. Next, we showed that SIRT1 overexpression inhibited RCC tumorigenesis both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, FGB expression was upregulated in RCC tissues and overexpressing SIRT1 reduced FGB expression levels. Furthermore, inhibition of RCC proliferation by SIRT1 overexpression was rescued by FGB overexpression, indicating that SIRT1 inhibited RCC proliferation by repressing FGB expression. Mechanistically, we confirmed that FGB was the target gene of STAT3, and SIRT1 repressed the expression of FGB by deacetylation of STAT3, leading to STAT3 destabilization and degradation. SIRT1 inhibited RCC tumorigenesis by downregulating FGB expression, and this novel SIRT1-STAT3-FGB axis provided a potential target for RCC therapy."

In decapod crustaceans, two isoforms of SIFamide are known, GYRKPPFNGSIFamide (Gly1-SIFamide), which is nearly ubiquitously conserved in the order, and VYRKPPFNGSIFamide (Val1-SIFamide), known only from members of the astacidean genus Homarus. While much work has focused on the identification of SIFamide isoforms in decapods, there are few direct demonstrations of physiological function for members of the peptide family in this taxon. Here, we assessed the effects of Gly1- and Val1-SIFamide on the cardiac neuromuscular system of two closely related species of Cancer crab, Cancer borealis and Cancer irroratus. In each species, both peptides were cardioactive, with identical, dose-dependent effects elicited by both isoforms in a given species. Threshold concentrations for bioactivity are in the range typically associated with hormonal delivery, i.e., 10-9 to 10-8 M. Interestingly, and quite surprisingly, while the predicted effects of SIFamide on cardiac output are similar in both C. borealis and C. irroratus, frequency effects predominate in C. borealis, while amplitude effects predominate in C. irroratus. These findings suggest that, while SIFamide is likely to increase cardiac output in both crabs, the mechanism through which this is achieved is different in the two species. Immunohistochemical/mass spectrometric data suggest that SIFamide is delivered to the heart hormonally rather than locally, with the source of hormonal release being midgut epithelial endocrine cells in both Cancer species. If so, midgut-derived SIFamide may function as a regulator of cardiac output during the process of digestion.",Screening for Dmrt genes from embryo to mature Macrobrachium rosenbergii prawns.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201800,General and comparative endocrinology,2019 06 15,"The doublesex and mab-3 related transcription factor (Dmrt) gene family is known to be related to the sexual regulators doublesex of arthropods and mab-3 of annelids and to hold highly conserved functions in sexual determination and differentiation across phyla. Here, we report a study of the Dmrt gene family in the freshwater prawn Macrobrachium rosenbergii, a crustacean whose sexual differentiation has been widely researched. A wide transcriptomic screen, from the embryo to the adult M.rosenbergii, identified five novel Dmrt genes (MroDmrts) and confirmed two known MroDmrts. The seven MroDmrts encode proteins of 275-855 amino acids; each protein contained at least one conserved DNA-binding DM domain, which is typical of Dmrt proteins, and five proteins contained 1 to 4 transactivation domains (TADs). Importantly, in the embryonic, larval and post-larval stages, MroDmrt genes exhibited time-dependent expression patterns rather than sex-specific expression. In-silico screening of the expression of the MroDmrt genes in adult males revealed the enrichment of MroiDmrt1b and MroiDmrt1c in the androgenic gland (AG) as compared to the eyestalks. In vivo silencing of the androgenic gland insulin-like (IAG) encoding gene significantly decreased the expression of the above two Dmrt genes, while not affecting the expression of control genes, thereby suggesting the possible role of these two genes in the IAG-switch and in sex-differentiation processes.",Non-homogeneous distribution of steroids in fecal pellets: An example in brown brocket deer (Mazama gouazoubira) with progesterone metabolites.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201799,General and comparative endocrinology,2019 06 15,"Measuring reproductive hormones in feces has become an important tool in the endocrine characterization of wild animals' reproduction. However, several factors may influence its success, such as fecal collection and storage techniques, knowledge of steroid hormone metabolism, the extraction procedure, immunoassay selection, inherent factors, and the distribution of steroid hormones in the feces. It is known that the distribution of these hormones in the feces is not homogeneous, and prior to the extraction of the steroidal metabolites, homogenization of the feces is recommended. Hormonal analysis is based on only a small fraction of the feces, which in theory should be representative of the total. In the case of cervids and other ruminants, feces consist of pellets. Here, the concentration of the steroid metabolites of each pellet was measured in order to evaluate the distribution of the fecal progesterone metabolites concentration in 10 pellets/fecal mass from five female Mazama gouazoubira. There were large variations in fecal progestin concentrations between the pellets of the same feces/female, showing the following amplitude variations: Animal A: 112%; Animal B: 164%; Animal C: 115%; Animal D: 62%; Animal E: 108%. These results show the importance of adequate homogenization prior to steroid metabolite extraction.",Mechanism of 17β-estradiol stimulated integration of human mesenchymal stem cells in heart tissue.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201797,Journal of molecular and cellular cardiology,2019 06 15,"Scarcity of gender specific donor hearts highlights the importance of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) as a therapeutic tool for heart repair. However, inefficient incorporation, retention, and activity of MSCs in cardiac tissue remain an obstacle. Since surges in follicular estradiol (E2; μmolar-range) trigger tissue remodeling (e.g. ovulation) and E2 exerts beneficial actions on the cardiovascular system, we hypothesized that E2 may promote/improve MSC-mediated cardiac repair processes. Using Wharton's jelly (WJ)-derived MSCs we assessed the effects of E2 on MSC proliferation, directed migration, and engraftment in murine heart slices (using xCELLigence real-time cell-impedance system, DNA quantification, and microscopy) and on MSC-induced angiogenesis in vivo (matrigel plug assay). Protein expression was assessed by Western blotting, ELISA/Luminex, and proteomic analysis; whereas mRNA expression was assessed by qRT-PCR. MSCs expressed estrogen receptors (ERs) -alpha and -beta. E2 promoted MSC proliferation and up-regulated mRNA and protein expression of ER-alpha, ER-beta, extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer (EMMPRIN), and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) -9, yet down-regulated MMP-2 expression. Moreover, E2 up-regulated expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A, VEGFR-2, vascular cell adhesion protein-1 (VCAM-1), and angiogenin (ANG) and stimulated nitric oxide (NO) production via ER. Proteomic analysis of MSCs showed that E2 up-regulated 47 proteins, down-regulated 7 proteins, and increased the expression of key biochemical components/pathways involved in tissue repair. In MSCs co-cultured with murine heart-slices, E2 significantly induced MSC migration in an ER-alpha-dependent fashion and significantly increased the secretion of MMP-2, MMP-9, ANG, and VEGF. In an in vivo matrigel assay, E2-treated MSCs increased angiogenesis and hemoglobin content. In conclusion, E2-treatment increases the incorporation of MSCs in heart slices and promotes MSC-induced angiogenesis. These beneficial effects are mediated via increases in molecules/pathways involved in tissue remodeling and angiogenesis. We speculate that E2 may enhance MSC ability to repair/regenerate cardiac tissue.",Adalimumab in juvenile-idiopathic arthritis-associated uveitis (JIA-U): 5-year follow-up of the Bristol participants of the SYCAMORE trial.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201796,American journal of ophthalmology,2019 06 15,"To determine longer-term outcomes of participants enrolled from a single center in the SYCAMORE trial, a randomized placebo-controlled trial of adalimumab versus placebo in children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis-associated uveitis (JIA-U) uncontrolled on methotrexate.",Time Trade-Off Utility Values in Noninfectious Uveitis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201795,American journal of ophthalmology,2019 06 15,To investigate time trade-off (TTO) utility values in patients with noninfectious uveitis and determine whether patient demographics and clinical characteristics are associated with utility scores.,Changes in management based on vitreous culture in endophthalmitis after intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor injection.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201794,American journal of ophthalmology,2019 06 15,To assess whether vitreous culture results affect the clinical management of patients with acute endophthalmitis after intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) injection.,Multiplexed monitoring of therapeutic antibodies for inflammatory diseases using Fab-selective proteolysis nSMOL coupled with LC-MS.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201793,Journal of immunological methods,2019 06 15,"Monoclonal antibodies have accelerated the availability of treatment options for many diseases in which the molecular mechanism has been elucidated in detail. Therefore, an assay that can universally analyze antibodies for clinical pharmacokinetics and cross-sectional studies would be indispensable. We have developed a universal antibody bioanalysis with a Fab-selective tryptic reaction, named nano-surface and molecular-orientation limited (nSMOL) proteolysis, that collects the specific antibody signature peptides in biological samples. Using the nSMOL method, we have fully validated the bioanalysis of many antibodies, Fc-fusion proteins, and their biosimilars. Inflammatory immune diseases often require long-term clinical management because of the remission and relapse observed. Accurate antibody monitoring in systemic circulation could contribute to the improvement of clinical outcomes. Because several biopharmaceuticals can be selected as practical treatment options, the assay development that quantitates many antibodies simultaneously would be applicable in many theraprutic monitoring. In this study, we have validated the LC-MS bioanalysis method for seven-mixed antibodies (Infliximab, Adalimumab, Ustekinumab, Golimumab, Eculizumab, Etanercept, and Abatacept) using the nSMOL normal reaction condition and two-mixed antibodies (Tocilizumab and Mepolizumab) using the acidified reduction acceleration condition, as reported in our previous papers. Moreover, this multiplexed assay has been verified using clinical patient samples. The nSMOL approach enables the quantitation of several immunosuppressive antibodies simultaneously in human serum, and nSMOL can potentially be applicable to the drug-drug interaction assays or therapeutic antibody monitoring of several inflammatory immune diseases to optimize administration.",FACS isolation of low percentage human antigen-specific CD8+ T cells based on activation-induced CD3 and CD8 downregulation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201792,Journal of immunological methods,2019 06 15,"As T cell activation leads to downregulation of T cell receptor (TCR) and coreceptor CD8, we developed a novel FACS-based sorting method to enrich activated antigen-specific CD8+ T cells. Using multiple established or low percentage T cell cultures, with either single antigen specificity or multiple influenza A virus antigen specificities, we have optimized the sorting method for T cell activation time and stimulating antigen dose. We have also sorted various numbers of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells into 96-well plates to demonstrate these T cells are capable of expanding into nearly pure CD8+ T cell lines. Our approach has the advantage of sorting antigen-specific T cells without knowing their specific antigenic epitopes or restricting HLA. We believe this method can be very helpful for successfully establishing CD8+ T cell lines for various purpose, including immunotherapy.",MHC-I peptide binding activity assessed by exchange after cleavage of peptide covalently linked to β2-microglobulin.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201791,Analytical biochemistry,2019 06 15,"A common approach to measuring binding constants involves combining receptor and ligand and measuring the distribution of bound and free states after equilibration. For class I major histocompatibility (MHC-I) proteins, which bind short peptides for presentation to T cells, this approach is precluded by instability of peptide-free protein. Here we develop a method wherein a weakly-binding peptide covalently attached to the N-terminus of the MHC-I β2m subunit is released from the peptide binding site after proteolytic cleavage of the linker. The resultant protein is able to bind added peptide. A direct binding assay and method for estimation of peptide binding constant (Kd) are described, in which fluorescence polarization is used to follow peptide binding. A competition binding assay and method for estimation of inhibitor binding constant (Ki) using the same principle also are also described. The method uses a cubic equation to relate observed binding to probe concentration, probe Kd, inhibitor concentration, and inhibitor Ki under general reaction conditions without assumptions relating to relative binding affinities or concentrations. We also delineate advantages of this approach compared to the Cheng-Prusoff and Munson-Rodbard approaches for estimation of Ki using competition binding data."

The most developed pretreatment candidate to date is plasma (native) human butyrylcholinesterase (HuBChE), which is limited in availability and because of its 1:1 stoichiometry with OPs, a large dose will present challenges when delivered parenterally both in terms of pharmacokinetics and manageability in the field. A tetrameric recombinant (r) form of human BChE produced in CHO-K1 cells with similar structure, in vivo stability and antidotal efficacy as the native form, has been developed to deliver rHuBChE as an aerosol (aer) to form a pulmonary bioshield capable of neutralizing inhaled OPs in situ and prevent AChE inhibition in the blood and in the brain; the latter associated with the symptoms of OP toxicity. Previous proof-of-concept macaque studies demonstrated that delivery of 9 mg/kg using a microsprayer inserted down the trachea, resulted in protection against an inhaled dose of 15ug/kg of aer-paraoxon (aer-Px) given 72 h later. In the present studies, pulmonary delivery of rHuBChE in macaques was achieved using Aerogen vibrating mesh nebulizers, similar to that used for human self-administration. The promising findings indicate that despite the poor lung deposition observed in macaques using nebulizers (13-20%), protective levels of RBC-AChE were still present in the blood even when exposure aer-Px (55 μg/kg) was delayed for five days. This long term retention of 5 mg/kg rHuBChE deposited in the lung bodes well for the use of an aer-rHuBChE pretreatment in humans where a user-friendly customized nebulizer with increased lung deposition up to 50% will provide even longer protection at a lower dose.",Genomic Medicine in Chagas Disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201776,Acta tropica,2019 06 15,"Genetic approaches have been proposed for improving the understanding of the causes of differential susceptibility to Trypanosoma cruzi infection and Chagas disease outcome.

However still today, the number of significant associated genes is limited and the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying this condition are unknown. This article review the information currently available from the published scientific literature regarding the genetic variants of molecules of the immune system and other variants that can contribute to the clinical presentation of the disease.

To assess the effects of urbanization, fragmentation, and land-use change in an arid city, we sampled the ant assemblages in three habitat types in Tucson, Arizona: irrigated neighborhood parks, urban desert remnants, and preserved desert. We analyzed the abundance, species richness, evenness, as well as the species and functional group composition of ant assemblages. We found no significant differences in species richness or evenness. However, irrigated parks had significantly greater ant abundances. Although some exotic species were present in the urban habitats, they did not have significant effects on ant diversity. Ant assemblages from all three habitat types were distinct from each other in their composition. Irrigated parks included a significantly higher proportion of species typically found in cooler and wetter climates. The differences in abundance and species composition between irrigated parks and the other habitats are likely the effect of irrigation removing water as a limiting factor for colony growth and increasing resource availability, as well as producing a localized cooling effect. Our results show that arid urban ecosystems may include considerable biodiversity, in part thanks to increased landscape heterogeneity resulting from the irrigation of green areas.","Promoting transitions of care, safety, and medication adherence for patients taking fingolimod in community pharmacies.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201774,American journal of health-system pharmacy : AJHP : official journal of the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists,2019 06 15,The development and dissemination of a specialty pharmacy service to optimize fingolimod therapy management are described.,Treatment of tricuspid valve endocarditis with daptomycin and linezolid therapy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201773,American journal of health-system pharmacy : AJHP : official journal of the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists,2019 06 15,A case report of the use of linezolid and daptomycin for the treatment of multidrug-resistant right-sided infective endocarditis is presented.,Anti-VCAM 1 Antibody-Coated Mesenchymal Stromal Cells Attenuate Experimental Colitis via Immunomodulation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201771,Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research,2019 06 15,"BACKGROUND The treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is still not satisfactory and novel technologies are clinically needed. This study aimed to examine the effect of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) coated with the anti-vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM 1) antibody on experimental colitis. MATERIAL AND METHODS The antibody was coated onto the MSCs isolated from male BALB/C mice to generate anti-VCAM 1 antibody-coated MSC (V-MSC). The Transwell assay was used to detect migration rate. 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS) was used to generate experimental colitis. MSCs were injected intravenously into experimental models. Weight changes, disease activity index, and histological changes were evaluated. The SRY gene were used for cell tracking. Expression of Ki67 and claudin 1 was used to measure local repair using immunohistochemistry. T helper (Th)1, Th2, Th17, and T regulatory cells were counted. RESULTS V-MSCs were successfully generated through coating MSCs with VCAM1 antibody. Analysis showed that the V-MSCs had similar surface types and differentiation as uncoated MSCs. Transwell assays showed that V-MSCs had higher migration rate than MSCs. After injection of V-MSCs, the expression of the SRY gene was enhanced in diseased colon and all indices (including weight changes, DAI score, histological changes, and the expressions of Ki67 and claudin 1) recovered rapidly. The ratio of proinflammatory Th1 and Th17 cells decreased, but the ratio of anti-inflammatory Th2 and Treg cells increased after the treatment.

Although several defect characteristics likely contribute to osteoarthritis, their relationship to local tissue deformation remains unclear. Using finite element models with various femoral cartilage geometries, we explore how defects change cartilage deformation and joint kinematics assuming loading representative of the maximum joint compression during the stance phase of gait. We show how defects, in combination with location-dependent cartilage mechanics, alter deformation in affected and opposing cartilages, as well as joint kinematics. Small and average sized defects increased maximum compressive strains by approximately 50% and 100%, respectively, compared to healthy cartilage. Shifts in the spatial locations of maximum compressive strains of defect containing models were also observed, resulting in loading of cartilage regions with reduced initial stiffnesses supporting the new, elevated loading environments. Simulated osteoarthritis (modeled as a global reduction in mean cartilage stiffness) did not significantly alter joint kinematics, but exacerbated tissue deformation. Femoral defects were also found to affect healthy tibial cartilage deformations. Lateral femoral defects increased tibial cartilage maximum compressive strains by 25%, while small and average sized medial defects exhibited decreases of 6% and 15%, respectively, compared to healthy cartilage. Femoral defects also affected the spatial distributions of deformation across the articular surfaces. These deviations are especially meaningful in the context of cartilage with location-dependent mechanics, leading to increases in peak contact stresses supported by the cartilage of between 11-34% over healthy cartilage.",Psychometric Evaluation of the Social Isolation Scale in Older Adults.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201744,The Gerontologist,2019 06 15,"Social isolation is known to be detrimental to the health of older adults, yet there is no brief instrument to measure it.

This can be done in a subject-specific manner using finite element (FE) modelling, but care is needed to ensure that modelling assumptions reflect the in-vivo environment. Here, we explored the influence of loading and boundary conditions (BC), and compared predictions to previous in-vivo measurements. Data were collected from a female participant who walked/ran on an instrumented treadmill while motion data were captured. Inverse dynamics of the leg (foot, shank and thigh segments) was combined with a musculoskeletal (MSK) model to estimate muscle and joint contact forces. These forces were applied to an FE model of the tibia, generated from computed tomography. Eight conditions varying loading/BCs were investigated. We found that modelling the fibula was necessary to predict realistic tibia bending. Applying joint moments from the MSK model to the FE model was also needed to predict torsional deformation. During walking, the most complex model predicted deformation of 0.5° posterior, 0.8° medial, and 1.4° internal rotation, comparable to in-vivo measurements of 0.5°-1°, 0.15°-0.7°, and 0.75°-2.2°, respectively. During running, predicted deformations of 0.3° posterior, 0.3° medial, and 0.5° internal rotation somewhat underestimated in-vivo measures of 0.85°-1.9°, 0.3°-0.9°, 0.65°-1.72°, respectively.

Vascular endothelial cells (ECs) are exposed to varying degrees of blood pressure, and therefore play an important role in these physiological and pathological events. However, the effect of blood pressure on endothelial cell functions remains to be elucidated. In particular, we do not know how ECs sense and respond to changes in hydrostatic pressure. Here, we found that exposure to hydrostatic pressure causes an early actomyosin-mediated contraction of ECs without a change in cell morphology. This response could be caused by water efflux from the ECs following exposure to hydrostatic pressure. Although only a limited study, these findings do explain a part of the mechanism through which ECs sense and respond to pressure.",A reduced-order flow model for fluid-structure interaction simulation of vocal fold vibration.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201740,Journal of biomechanical engineering,2019 06 15,"We present a novel reduced-order glottal airflow model that can be coupled with the three-dimensional (3D) solid mechanics model of the vocal fold tissue to simulate the fluid-structure interaction (FSI) during voice production. This type of hybrid FSI models have potential applications in the estimation of the tissue properties that are unknown due to patient variations and/or neuromuscular activities. In this work, the flow is simplified to a one-dimensional (1D) momentum equation based model incorporating the entrance effect and energy loss in the glottis. The performance of the flow model is assessed using a simplified yet 3D vocal fold configuration. We use the immersed-boundary method based 3D FSI simulation as a benchmark to evaluate the momentum based model as well as the Bernoulli-based 1D flow models. The results show that the new model has significantly better performance than the Bernoulli models in terms of prediction for the vocal fold vibration frequency, amplitude, and phase delay. Furthermore, the comparison results are consistent for different medial thicknesses of the vocal fold, subglottal pressures, and tissue material behaviors, indicating that the new model has better robustness than previous reduced-order models.",On the turbulence modeling of blood flow in a stenotic vessel.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201739,Journal of biomechanical engineering,2019 06 15,"The blood flow dynamics in a stenosed, subject-specific carotid bifurcation is numerically simulated using Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) and Reynolds-averaged Navier--Stokes (RANS) equations closed with turbulence models. The former is meant to provide a term of comparison for the RANS calculations, that include classic two-equations models ($k-\epsilon$ and $k-\omega$) as well as a transitional three-equations eddy-viscosity model ($k_T-k_L-\omega$). Pulsatile inlet conditions based on in-vivo ultrasound measurements of blood velocity are used. The blood is modelled as a Newtonian fluid, and the vessel walls are rigid. The main purpose of this work is to highlight the problems related to the use of classic RANS models in the numerical simulation of such flows. The time-averaged DNS results, interpreted in view of their finite-time averaging error, are used to demonstrate the superiority of the transitional RANS model, which is found to provide results closer to DNS than those of conventional models. The transitional model is shown to possess better predictive capabilities in terms of turbulence intensity, temporal evolution of the pressure along the cardiac cycle, and the oscillatory shear index (OSI). Indeed, DNS brings to light the locally transitional or weakly turbulent state of the blood flow, which presents velocity and pressure fluctuations only in the post-stenotic region of the internal carotid artery during systole, while the flow is laminar during diastole.",Longitudinal Reinforcement of Acute Myocardial Infarcts Improves Function by Transmurally Redistributing Stretch and Stress.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201738,Journal of biomechanical engineering,2019 06 15,"A wide range of emerging therapies from surgical restraint to biomaterial injection to tissue engineering aim to improve heart function and limit adverse remodeling following myocardial infarction (MI). We previously showed that longitudinal surgical reinforcement of large anterior infarcts in dogs could significantly enhance systolic function without restricting diastolic function, but the underlying mechanisms for this improvement are poorly understood. The goal of this study was to construct a finite-element model that could match our previously published data on changes in regional strains and left ventricular function following longitudinal surgical reinforcement, then use the model to explore potential mechanisms for the improvement in systolic function we observed. The model presented here, implemented in FEBio, matches all the key features of our experiments, including diastolic remodeling strains in the ischemic region, small shifts in the end-diastolic pressure-volume relationship (EDPVR), and large changes in the end-systolic pressure-volume relationship (ESPVR) in response to ischemia and to patch application. Detailed examination of model strains and stresses suggests that longitudinal reinforcement reduces peak diastolic fiber stretch and systolic fiber stress in the remote myocardium and shifts those peaks away from the endocardial surface by reshaping the left ventricle (LV). These finding could help guide the development of novel therapies to improve post-MI function by providing specific design objectives.",Treatment with Recombinant Interleukin-15 (IL-15) Increases the Number of T Cells and Natural Killer (NK) Cells and Levels of Interferon-γ (IFN-γ) in a Rat Model of Sepsis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201735,Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research,2019 06 15,"BACKGROUND This study aimed to investigate the effects of treatment with recombinant interleukin-15 (IL-15) on T cells, natural killer (NK) cells, and interferon-γ (IFN-γ) on the immune response in a rat cecal ligation and perforation model of sepsis. MATERIAL AND METHODS Sprague-Dawley rats (n=120) were divided into four groups (n=30). A rat model of clinical sepsis was created using cecal ligation and perforation, and 109 rats successfully developed sepsis. Rats were then injected intraperitoneally with 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 μg of recombinant rat IL-15 or saline. Survival was determined, and the numbers of T cells and NK cells, and the expression levels of IL-15 and IFN-γ were detected in the peripheral blood of rats in each group at 24 h and 48 h. RESULTS The levels of IL-15 and IFN-γ, as well as the numbers of T cells and NK cells, were significantly increased in the IL-15-treated groups compared with the control group at both 24 h and 48 h (P<0.05). Levels of IL-15 and IFN-γ were significantly increased in the IL-15-treated groups at 48 h compared with 24 h in the control group. Levels of IL-15, the numbers of T cells and NK cells, and the levels of IFN-γ in peripheral blood were significantly lower at 48 h when compared with 24 h (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS In a rat model of sepsis, treatment with recombinant IL-15 significantly increased T cell and NK cell numbers, and levels of IFN-γ, and prolonged the survival of rats with sepsis."

Based on 16S rRNA analysis, IMCC1322 was found to belong to the OCS28 sub-clade of SAR116. The cells appeared as short vibrioids in logarithmic-phase culture, and elongated spirals during incubation with mitomycin or in aged culture. Growth characteristics of strain IMCC1322 were further evaluated based on genomic information; proteorhodopsin (PR), carbon monoxide dehydro-genase, and dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP)-utilizing enzymes. IMCC1322 PR was characterized as a functional retinylidene protein that acts as a light-driven proton pump in the cytoplasmic membrane.

SHP-2 exerted a favorable influence on immune organ coefficients and ameliorated the histopathological hepatic lesions and apoptosis in hepatocytes of Dgalactose- aged mice almost in a dose-dependent manner. Using the same analytical methods, on comparison with previously studied EPS compounds (i.e. SHP-1), SHP-2 was found to have more complex structure, larger molecule weight, and different anti-aging properties. The results presented here suggest that not only does EPS bioactivity vary with respect to molecular structures and molecule weight, but that multiple structures with different activity can be expressed by a single fungal strain. These results may help understanding the antiaging prosperity of these polysaccharides for use in health foods or dietary supplements.",Therapeutic Strategies to Block the Hypoxic Response.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201722,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,2019 06 15,"Patients with the low levels of O2 (hypoxia) in their primary tumors have a higher risk for metastasis and death, indicating a need to therapeutically inhibit the effectors of hypoxia. Many strategies have been developed and investigated to block the hypoxic response. For example, inhibitors of HIF-1 and HIF-2 function by altering the transcription, translation, dimerization, nuclear translocation, DNA-binding, or ubiquitination of the HIF proteins. Hypoxia-activated prodrugs inhibit the hypoxic response through hypoxia-mediated reduction of an inactive, or minimally active, chemical to a cytotoxic agent. Most hypoxia-activated prodrugs function by inducing DNA damage, but others with more novel functions, including prodrugs that release EGFR/HER2 inhibitors also exist. Despite the existence of many therapeutics to combat the hypoxic response, there has been very little success in late phase clinical trials, potentially due to a lack of biomarkers that can be used to stratify patients who would benefit from a hypoxia-targeted therapy.",Hypoxia-Induced Resistance to Chemotherapy in Cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201721,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,2019 06 15,"A major barrier to the successful management of cancer is the development of resistance to therapy. Chemotherapy resistance can either be an intrinsic property of malignant cells developed prior to therapy, or acquired following exposure to anti-cancer drugs. Given the impact of drug resistance to the overall poor survival of cancer patients, there is an urgent need to better understand the molecular pathways regulating this malignant phenotype. In this chapter we describe some of the molecular pathways that contribute to drug resistance in cancer, the role of a microenvironment deficient in oxygen (hypoxia) in malignant progression, and how hypoxia can be a significant factor in the development of drug resistance. We conclude by proposing potential therapeutic approaches that take advantage of a hypoxic microenvironment to chemosensitize therapy-resistant tumours.",Mechanistic Justifications of Systemic Therapeutic Oxygenation of Tumors to Weaken the Hypoxia Inducible Factor 1α-Mediated Immunosuppression.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201720,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,2019 06 15,"Long-term studies of anti-pathogen and anti-tumor immunity have provided complementary genetic and pharmacological evidence for the immunosuppressive and immunomodulatory effects of Hypoxia-HIF-1α and adenosine-mediated suppression via the A2A adenosine receptor signaling pathway (Hypoxia-A2A-adenosinergic). This pathway is life saving when it protects inflamed tissues of vital organs from collateral damage by overactive anti-pathogen immune cells or enables the differentiation of cells of adaptive immunity. However, the Hypoxia-A2A-adenosinergic immunosuppression can also prevent tumor rejection by inhibiting the anti-tumor effects of T and NK cells. In addition, this suppressive pathway has been shown to mask tumors due to the hypoxia-HIF-α-mediated loss of MHC Class I molecules on tumor cells. It is suggested that it will be impossible to realize the full anti-tumor capacities of current cancer immunotherapies without simultaneous administration of anti-Hypoxia-A2A-Adenosinergic drugs that inactivate this tumor-protecting mechanism in hypoxic and adenosine-rich tumors.Here, we overview the supporting evidence for the conceptually novel immunotherapeutic motivation to breathe supplemental oxygen (40-60%) or to repurpose already available oxygenation agents in combination with current immunotherapies. Preclinical studies provide strong support for oxygen immunotherapy to enable much stronger tumor regression by weakening immunosuppression by A2A adenosine receptors and by the Hypoxia➔HIF-1α axis. The results of these studies emphasize the value of systemic oxygenation as clinically feasible, promising, and as a valuable tool for mechanistic investigations of tumor biology and cancer immunology. Perhaps the most effective and feasible among individual members of this novel class of anti-tumor drugs are oxygenation agents.",Hypoxia and the Metastatic Niche.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201719,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,2019 06 15,"Metastasis is considered the latest stage of cancer development; however, metastasis occurs earlier than it can be detected. Metastatic sites are actively remodeled by secretory factors including growth factors, chemokines and cytokines, extracellular matrix (ECM) enzymes, and exosomes produced by the primary cancer tissues. Many of the associated-secretory factors are abundantly induced by inflammation and hypoxia. These secretory factors modify the ECM, immune composition, and blood vessel permeability of the future metastatic sites, a process termed 'metastatic niche formation.' In general, ECM is modified to enhance the attachment of other cell types or cancer cells to establish a growth-factor rich metastatic niche. Immune-suppressive cells such as tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and regulatory T cells (Tregs) dominate the metastatic niche to allow metastatic cancer cells to bypass immune surveillance and propagate. Endothelial cell-to-cell junctions of blood vessels are loosened to enhance the penetrance of metastatic cancer cells to the metastatic sites. Different metastatic tissues have unique ECM constituents, resident immune cells, and anatomical positions linked with the circulatory system; therefore, many cancer types have their own metastatic pattern, and they favor metastasis to specific organs. Some of the remodeling events represent the earliest step of metastasis, even preceding the detachment of cancer cells from the primary tumor site. Understanding how the metastatic niche is formed is important for the development of drugs to prevent the earliest step of metastasis and advance our understanding of organotrophic metastasis. This review summarizes the major findings in the field of metastatic niche highlighting the role of hypoxia.",Hypoxia-Dependent Angiogenesis and Lymphangiogenesis in Cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201717,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,2019 06 15,"Hypoxia (low O2) is a ubiquitous feature of solid cancers, arising as a mismatch between cellular O2 supply and consumption. Hypoxia is associated to metastatic disease and mortality owing to its ability to stimulate the formation of blood (angiogenesis) and lymphatic vessels (lymphangiogenesis), thereby allowing cancer cells to escape the unfavorable tumor microenvironment and disseminate into secondary sites. This review outlines molecular mechanisms by which intratumoral hypoxia regulates the expression of motogenic and mitogenic factors that induce angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis, whilst discussing their implications for metastatic cancers.",Hypoxia and the Tumor Secretome.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201716,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,2019 06 15,"Metastasis remains the leading cause of cancer-related deaths. To date, there are no specific treatments targeting disseminated disease. New therapeutic options will become available only if we enhance our understanding of mechanisms underlying metastatic spread. A large body of literature shows that the metastatic potential of tumor cells is strongly influenced by microenvironmental cues such as low oxygen (hypoxia). Clinically, hypoxia is a hallmark of most solid tumors and is associated with increased metastasis and poor survival in a variety of cancer types. Mechanistically, hypoxia influences multiple steps within the metastatic cascade and particularly impacts the interactions between tumor cells and host stroma at both primary and secondary sites. Here we review current evidence for a hypoxia-induced tumor secretome and its impact on metastatic progression. These studies have identified potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets that could be integrated into strategies for preventing and treating metastatic disease.",Clinical and Pre-clinical Methods for Quantifying Tumor Hypoxia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201714,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,2019 06 15,"Hypoxia, a prevalent characteristic of most solid malignant tumors, contributes to diminished therapeutic responses and more aggressive phenotypes. The term hypoxia has two definitions. One definition would be a physiologic state where the oxygen partial pressure is below the normal physiologic range. For most normal tissues, the normal physiologic range is between 10 and 20 mmHg. Hypoxic regions develop when there is an imbalance between oxygen supply and demand. The impact of hypoxia on cancer therapeutics is significant: hypoxic tissue is 3× less radiosensitive than normoxic tissue, the impaired blood flow found in hypoxic tumor regions influences chemotherapy delivery, and the immune system is dependent on oxygen for functionality. Despite the clinical implications of hypoxia, there is not a universal, ideal method for quantifying hypoxia, particularly cycling hypoxia because of its complexity and heterogeneity across tumor types and individuals. Most standard imaging techniques can be modified and applied to measuring hypoxia and quantifying its effects; however, the benefits and challenges of each imaging modality makes imaging hypoxia case-dependent. In this chapter, a comprehensive overview of the preclinical and clinical methods for quantifying hypoxia is presented along with the advantages and disadvantages of each.",Hypoxia Mediates Tumor Malignancy and Therapy Resistance.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201713,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,2019 06 15,"Hypoxia is a hallmark of the tumor microenvironment and contributes to tumor malignant phenotypes.

However, cloud cover constitutes a major obstacle to land cover classification in coastal tropical regions including Lagos State. In this work, a land cover appearance for Lagos State is examined using Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and Land Satellite 8 (Landsat 8) imageries. To this aim, a Sentinel-1 SAR dual-pol (VV+VH) Interferometric Wide swath mode (IW) data orbit for 2017 and a Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) for 2017 over Lagos State were acquired and analysed. The Sentinel-1 imagery was calibrated and terrain corrected using a SRTM 3Sec DEM. Maximum likelihood classification algorithm was performed. A supervised pixel-based imagery classification to classify the dataset using training points selected from RGB combination of VV and VH polarizations was applied. Accuracy assessment was performed using test data collected from high-resolution imagery of Google Earth to determine the overall classification accuracy and Kappa coefficient. The Landsat 8 was orthorectified and maximum likelihood classification algorithm also performed. The results for Sentinel-1 include an RGB composite of the imagery, classified imagery, with overall accuracy calculated as 0.757, while the kappa value was evaluated to be about 0.719. Also, the Landsat 8 includes a RBG composite of the imagery, classified imagery, but an overall accuracy of 0.908 and a kappa value of 0.876.

For robustness checking, three estimator techniques reveal no evidence of inverted U-shape EKC consistently. Moreover, renewable energy consumption plays negative impact on emissions, while urbanization plays positive, significantly.

The BPA exposure model of pregnant mice was prepared by intragastric administration of BPA at the doses of 0, 2.5, 5, 10, 20, and 40 mg/kg/day at gestation day (GD) 0.5-17.5. The testis index of the offspring mice was calculated at postnatal day (PND) 21 and PND 56. The results showed that maternal exposure to 20 mg/kg BPA during pregnancy significantly increased the testicular index of F1 males at PND 21, and 40 mg/kg BPA significantly decreased the testicular index of F1 males at PND 56 (P < 0.01). BPA significantly reduced serum testosterone (T) and estradiol (E2) levels, and improved testicular ERα and ERβ levels in F1 males at both PND 21 and PND 56. BPA exposure also upregulated transcription of testicular Dnmt1 and inhibited the transcription of testicular Dnmt3A and Dnmt3B in F1 mice at PND 21. BPA reduced the transcriptional level of testicular DNA methyltransferase (Dnmt), increased the expression of testicular caspase-7, caspase-9, and bax, and decreased the expression of bcl-2 in F1 mice at PND 56. Consistent with that, BPA improved the apoptosis rate in the testis at PND 56 (P < 0.01 or P < 0.05). Our study indicates that BPA disrupts the secretion of testosterone, estradiol, and estrogen receptors by interfering with the transcription of testicular DNA methyltransferase (Dnmt) in offspring males, which damages testicular tissues and affects the potential reproductive function.",Using Plantago major and Plantago lanceolata in environmental pollution research in an urban area of Southern Poland.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201696,Environmental science and pollution research international,2019 06 15,"The aim of this study was to perform a complex assessment of changes in the elements of an ecosystem that are caused by environmental pollution in industrial and urban biotopes.

Evidence suggests that the prevalence of UI is higher in subjects with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) than in age-matched controls in both sexes. UI is classified as stress, urge, and mixed, and has a considerable impact on quality of life. However, the prevalence of UI in individuals with COPD is mostly unexplored in clinical research and often underestimated in clinical practice. Interestingly, although the involuntary leakage of a small amount of urine during coughing (e.g., stress UI) is among the most plausible causes of UI in patients with COPD, its importance has been questioned by some researchers. Moreover, UI as a respiratory drug-related adverse effect is largely overlooked; only a few randomized controlled trials have reported the presence of urinary symptoms, mainly as urinary retention due to anticholinergic agents. In this narrative review, we explored whether, and to what extent, UI occurs in COPD individuals, and what the proposed actions to improve this condition are. We found that the association between UI and COPD is largely unexplored, mostly because UI tends to be attributed to older age. We infer that the prevalence of UI in individuals with chronic respiratory symptoms is often underestimated in clinical practice. The misinterpretation of urinary symptoms as related to the respiratory condition can delay diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. The use of simple self-administered questionnaires to assess the presence of UI is encouraged."

The actual extent of the lesions was determined using micro-CT examination. The optimal cutoff test value was determined using the Youden index. For the two methods, inter- and intra-examiner reproducibility was calculated using intraclass correlation coefficient. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of these methods were compared using the mid-P McNemar test. The level of significance was set at p < 0.05.

Age-related erosion of the T cell compartment has been implicated as a likely cause, but the underlying mechanisms driving this immunosenescence have not been quantitatively modeled and systematically analyzed. T cell receptor diversity, or the extent of pathogen-derived antigen responsiveness of the T cell pool, is known to diminish with age, but inherent experimental difficulties preclude accurate analysis on the full organismal level. In this paper, we formulate a mechanistic mathematical model of T cell population dynamics on the immunoclonal subpopulation level, which provides quantitative estimates of diversity. We define different estimates for diversity that depend on the individual number of cells in a specific immunoclone. We show that diversity decreases with age primarily due to diminished thymic output of new T cells and the resulting overall loss of small immunoclones.",Dynamics of Pivoting Electrical Waves in a Cardiac Tissue Model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201662,Bulletin of mathematical biology,2019 06 15,"Through a detailed mathematical analysis we seek to advance our understanding of how cardiac tissue conductances govern pivoting (spiral, scroll, rotor, functional reentry) wave dynamics. This is an important problem in cardiology since pivoting waves likely underlie most reentrant tachycardias. The problem is complex, and to advance our methods of analysis we introduce two new tools: a ray tracing method and a moving-interface model. When used in combination with an ionic model, they permit us to elucidate the role played by tissue conductances on pivoting wave dynamics. Specifically we simulate traveling electrical waves with an ionic model that can reproduce the characteristics of plane and pivoting waves in small patches of cardiac tissue. Then ray tracing is applied to the simulated pivoting waves in a manner to expose their real displacement. In this exercise we find loci with special characteristics, as well as zones where a part of a pivoting wave quickly transitions from a regenerative to a non-regenerative propagation mode. The loci themselves and the monitoring of the ionic model state variables in this zone permit to elucidate several aspects of pivoting wave dynamics. We then formulate the moving-interface model based on the information gathered with the above-mentioned analysis. Equipped with a velocity profile v(s), s: distance along of the pivoting wave contour and the steady- state action potential duration (APD) of a plane wave during entrainment, APDss(T), at period T, this simple model can predict: shape, orbit of revolution, rotation period, whether a pivoting wave will break up or not, and whether the tissue will admit pivoting waves or not. Because v(s) and APDss(T) are linked to the ionic model, dynamical analysis with the moving-interface model conveys information on the role played by tissue conductances on pivoting wave dynamics. The analysis conducted here enables us to better understand previous results on the termination of pivoting waves. We surmise the method put forth here could become a means to discover how to alter tissue conductances in a manner to terminate pivoting waves at the origin of reentrant tachycardias."

We assume that the observed protective properties of the group of HLA-DRB1*01 alleles may be directly associated with the ability of HLA-DRB1*01:01 to kinetically distinguish peptides of exogenous and endogenous nature.",Ligand Docking to the Acidic Pocket of the Proton-Gated Ion Channel Asic1A.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201627,Doklady. Biochemistry and biophysics,2019 06 15,"In this study, we performed the docking of ligands of the ASIC1a ion channel, which exert potentiating or inhibitory effects by stabilizing the open and closed states, respectively. It is shown for the first time that the direction of effect may depend on the three-dimensional structure of the ligand.

Biochemistry and biophysics,2019 06 15,"Reduced expression of metastatic marker protein S100A4 in triple-negative breast cancer cells MDA-MB-231 leads to a decrease in the migration ability of cells and increases the sensitivity of the modified cells to docetaxel therapy. Cells capable of migration differ from the immotile cells in the content of the S100A4 protein in the cell, and this difference persists after the treatment of cells with the agents that reduce the intracellular level of S100A4. The presence of exogenous S100A4 protein in culture medium reduces the content of this protein in breast cancer cells. The results of the study show that the ability of breast cancer cells to migrate depends on the S100A4 protein concentration in the cell.",Optimization of Heterologous Expression of Insulin Receptor-Related Receptor Ectodomain.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201624,Doklady.

Biochemistry and biophysics,2019 06 15,"This is the first study to investigate the molecular-genetic organization of polytene chromosome interbands located on both molecular and cytological maps of Drosophila genome. The majority of the studied interbands contained one gene with a single transcription initiation site; the remaining interbands contained one gene with several alternative promoters, two or more unidirectional genes, and ""head-to-head"" arranged genes. In addition, intricately arranged interbands containing three or more genes in both unidirectional and bidirectional orientation were found. Insulator proteins, ORC, P-insertions, DNase I hypersensitive sites, and other open chromatin structures were situated in the promoter region of the genes located in the interbands. This area is critical for the formation of the interband, an open chromatin region in which gene transcription and replication are combined.",Infections Caused by Influenza Viruses Among Children in Poland During the 2017/18 Epidemic Season.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201622,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,2019 06 15,"Influenza is an infectious disease that is a threat to both children and adults. The most effective way to prevent infections among children is seasonal vaccination in every epidemic season, which is recommended from the age of 6 months onward. This study is a report of the prevalence of influenza infection in the population of children up to the age of 14 years and of the type of influenza virus involved during the 2017/18 epidemic season in Poland. We found that influenza A and B viruses co-dominated in the season. Among the influenza A viruses, A/H1N1/ pdm09 subtype was a more frequent source of infection than A/H3N2/ subtype. In addition, the prevalence of infection was re-analyzed in children stratified into the age groups of 0-4, 5-9, and 10-14 years old. We found a relation between the age of a child and the type of influenza virus causing infection. The youngest children under 4 years were the most vulnerable to both influenza and influenza-like infections; the former caused mostly by influenza A and the latter by RSV. In contradistinction, influenza B dominated in the oldest children aged 10-14 and RSV infections were not present in this age group. The characteristics of influenza viruses may however vary on the seasonal basis.",A multiscale computational fluid dynamics approach to simulate the micro-fluidic environment within a tissue engineering scaffold with highly irregular pore geometry.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201621,Biomechanics and modeling in mechanobiology,2019 06 15,"Mechanical stimulation can regulate cellular behavior, e.g., differentiation, proliferation, matrix production and mineralization. To apply fluid-induced wall shear stress (WSS) on cells, perfusion bioreactors have been commonly used in tissue engineering experiments. The WSS on cells depends on the nature of the micro-fluidic environment within scaffolds under medium perfusion. Simulating the fluidic environment within scaffolds will be important for gaining a better insight into the actual mechanical stimulation on cells in a tissue engineering experiment. However, biomaterial scaffolds used in tissue engineering experiments typically have highly irregular pore geometries. This complexity in scaffold geometry implies high computational costs for simulating the precise fluidic environment within the scaffolds. In this study, we propose a low-computational cost and feasible technique for quantifying the micro-fluidic environment within the scaffolds, which have highly irregular pore geometries. This technique is based on a multiscale computational fluid dynamics approach. It is demonstrated that this approach can capture the WSS distribution in most regions within the scaffold. Importantly, the central process unit time needed to run the model is considerably low.",Patient-specific predictions of aneurysm growth and remodeling in the ascending thoracic aorta using the homogenized constrained mixture model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201620,Biomechanics and modeling in mechanobiology,2019 06 15,"In its permanent quest of mechanobiological homeostasis, our vasculature significantly adapts across multiple length and timescales in various physiological and pathological conditions. Computational modeling of vascular growth and remodeling (G&R) has significantly improved our insights into the mechanobiological processes of diseases such as hypertension or aneurysms. However, patient-specific computational modeling of ascending thoracic aortic aneurysm (ATAA) evolution, based on finite element models (FEM), remains a challenging scientific problem with rare contributions, despite the major significance of this topic of research. Challenges are related to complex boundary conditions and geometries combined with layer-specific G&R responses. To address these challenges, in the current paper, we employed the constrained mixture model (CMM) to model the arterial wall as a mixture of different constituents such as elastin, collagen fiber families and smooth muscle cells. Implemented in Abaqus as a UMAT, this first patient-specific CMM-based FEM of G&R in human ATAA was first validated for canonical problems such as single-layer thick-wall cylindrical and bilayer thick-wall toric arterial geometries. Then it was used to predict ATAA evolution for a patient-specific aortic geometry, showing that the typical shape of an ATAA can be simply produced by elastin proteolysis localized in regions of deranged hemodymanics. The results indicate a transfer of stress to the adventitia by elastin loss and continuous adaptation of the stress distribution due to change in ATAA shape. Moreover, stress redistribution leads to collagen deposition where the maximum elastin mass is lost, which in turn leads to stiffening of the arterial wall. As future work, the predictions of this G&R framework will be validated on datasets of patient-specific ATAA geometries followed up over a significant number of years."

In this process, non-resolving inflammation is a prime component of accelerated cardiovascular disease and subsequent fatal events associated with imbalanced diet, physical inactivity, disrupted circadian rhythms, neuro-hormonal stress, and poly- or co-medication. Laboratory rodents have established that splenic leukocyte-directed resolution mechanisms are essential for cardiac repair after injury. Here, we discuss the impact of three lifestyle-related factors that are prime causes of derailed cardiac healing, putative non-resolving inflammation-resolution mechanisms in cardiovascular diseases, and progressive heart failure after cardiac injury. The presented review resurfaces the lifestyle-related risks and future research directions required to understand the molecular and cellular mechanisms between the causes of cardiovascular disease and their related consequences of non-resolving inflammation.","Chemical Modification of 1-Aminocyclopropane Carboxylic Acid (ACC) Oxidase: Cysteine Mutational Analysis, Characterization, and Bioconjugation with a Nitroxide Spin Label.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201604,Molecular biotechnology,2019 06 15,"1-Aminocyclopropane carboxylic acid oxidase (ACCO) catalyzes the last step of ethylene biosynthesis in plants. Although some sets of structures have been described, there are remaining questions on the active conformation of ACCO and in particular, on the conformation and potential flexibility of the C-terminal part of the enzyme. Several techniques based on the introduction of a probe through chemical modification of amino acid residues have been developed for determining the conformation and dynamics of proteins. Cysteine residues are recognized as convenient targets for selective chemical modification of proteins, thanks to their relatively low abundance in protein sequences and to their well-mastered chemical reactivity. ACCOs have generally 3 or 4 cysteine residues in their sequences. By a combination of approaches including directed mutagenesis, activity screening on cell extracts, biophysical and biochemical characterization of purified enzymes, we evaluated the effect of native cysteine replacement and that of insertion of cysteines on the C-terminal part in tomato ACCO. Moreover, we have chosen to use paramagnetic labels targeting cysteine residues to monitor potential conformational changes by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR). Given the level of conservation of the cysteines in ACCO from different plants, this work provides an essential basis for the use of cysteine as probe-anchoring residues.",Effect of diet composition on dry matter intake of dairy she-camels.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201603,Tropical animal health and production,2019 06 15,"The present paper aims to propose an evaluation of the ingestibility and selectivity of food items, as well as the effect of different levels of energetic supplementation and concentrate feed ingredients, on camels dry matter intake (DMI). With this goal, an experiment on six dairy she-camels receiving every 14-15 days a progressive high level of concentrates was conducted. During experimental periods, DMI ranged from 1.30 to 1.96 kg DMI per 100 kg of body weight (BW) was used. In an effort to examine the feeding behavior, a sign of reduced appetite was observed. Based on the results, it can be unveiled that as soon as the concentrate intake (CI) reached a quantity of 3.3 kg DM/d, which represented 51% of the total DM intake, the camels did not appear to ingest more exceedingly and their eating activity occurred in a distributed manner during daytime. Besides, an amount of concentrate supplements, which can characterize a high selectivity to fermentable carbohydrates, fed camels consumed dates, as well. In addition, food items such as corn, soybean meal, and dates that are rich in simple nutrient improved DMI. However, the statistical analysis did not reveal any statistically significant negative effect of concentrates on hay ingestion used in the experimental diets. Therefore, the intake of concentrates did not substitute the ingested amount of hay. Furthermore, the immense incorporation of dates and the increase in energy density of diet (DER) negatively affected the ingestion of hay.",Inclusion of licuri meal in the diet of pasture dairy cows.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201602,Tropical animal health and production,2019 06 15,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the inclusion of increasing levels of licuri meal as a substitute for soybean bran in the diet of pasture-based dairy cows and its effects on the intake, nutrient digestibility, and milk production and composition. Eight crossbred Holstein/Zebu cows were used in two 4 × 4 Latin square plots. The diets contained increasing percentage of licuri meal (0.0, 4.16, 7.09, and 9.45%) in the total diet, replacing soybean bran. The inclusion of licuri meal in the diet affected total dry matter intake and dry matter intake in relation to body weight, which presented a quadratic effect. The same behavior was observed for the consumption of EE, CP, TDN, and NDFap. The NFC consumption showed a linear decrease with the addition of the by-product in the diet. There was no influence of the inclusion of the licuri meal on the digestibility of the DM, CP, NFC, and TDN, while the digestibility of the NDFap and EE presented increasing linear effect. There was a reduction of milk production and food efficiency with the inclusion of increasing levels of the meal. The fat content in milk showed a linear increasing effect. Ditto for cholesterol. It is recommended to include not more than 7.00% of licuri meal for lactating cows with an average production of 20 kg day-1.","Extracellular biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles from Penicillium italicum and its antioxidant, antimicrobial and cytotoxicity activities.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201601,Biotechnology letters,2019 06 15,"The synthesis of silver nanoparticles and its antioxidant, antimicrobial and cytotoxic activities was investigated and extracellularly biosynthesized using Penicillium italicum isolated from Iraqi lemon fruits.",Real-Time and Online Monitoring of Glucose Contents by Using Molecular Imprinted Polymer-Based IDEs Sensor.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201600,Applied biochemistry and biotechnology,2019 06 15,"A highly sensitive, selective, reversible, and reusable glucose sensor is developed by using molecularly imprinted polymer-based artificial receptors onto interdigital transducer.

Segmentation of the blood smear cells and extraction of features of the cells is essential in the field of medicine. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia is a form of blood cancer caused due to the abnormal increase in the production of immature white blood cells in the bone marrow. It mostly affects the children below 5 years and adults above 50 years of age. Due to the late diagnosis and cost of the devices used for the determination, the mortality rate has increased drastically. Flow cytometry technique that performs automated counting fails to identify the abnormal cells. Manual recount performed using hemocytometer are prone to errors and are imprecise. The proposed work aims to survey different computer-aided system techniques used to segment the blood smear image. The primary objective here is to derive knowledge from the different methodologies used for extracting features from white blood cells and develop a system that would accurately segment the blood smear image by overcoming the drawbacks of the previous works. The objective mentioned above is achieved in two ways. Firstly, a novel algorithm is developed to segment the nucleus and cytoplasm of white blood cell. Secondly, a model is built to extract the features and train the model. The different supervised classifiers are compared, and the one with the highest accuracy is used for the classification. Six hundred images are used in the experimentation. InfoGainAttributeEval and the Ranker Search method are used to achieve the feature selection which in turn helps in improvising the classifier performance. The result shows the classification of the acute lymphoblastic leukemia into its three respective categories namely: ALL-L1, ALL-L2, ALL-L3. The model can differentiate between a normal peripheral blood smear and an abnormal blood smear. The extracted feature values of a cancerous cell and a normal cell are also shown. The performance of the model is evaluated using the test images stained with various stains. The proposed algorithm achieved an overall accuracy of 98.6%. The promising results show that it can be used as a diagnostic tool by the pathologists. Graphical abstract."

A critical and highly regulated step of steroidogenesis involves the importation of cholesterol within the mitochondria by the steroidogenic acute regulatory (STAR) protein. During aging, STAR protein levels in Leydig cells gradually decrease, leading to a reduced entry of cholesterol into mitochondria and lower testosterone production. In addition to preserving its steroidogenic capacity, tumor Leydig cells can also be excellent models for evaluating the mechanisms of action of anticancer agents. In this study, we examined whether polyphenolics having structural similarities to luteolin could promote steroidogenic and cancer-related gene expressions within rat L540 tumor Leydig cells. In this cell model, luteolin activated Star expression and increased progesterone as well as testosterone productions. Interestingly, luteolin decreased gene expression related to cholesterol biosynthesis, possibly inhibiting membrane synthesis and cell proliferation. In addition, increased expression of genes such as Fas, Cdkn1a, Atp7b, and Tp53, as well as increased accumulation of cleaved caspase 3 and PARP, in response to luteolin treatment indicates that apoptosis is being activated. Luteolin also modulated the expression of genes involved in stress response, such as glutathione-S transferases Gsta1 and Gstt2, and the unfolded protein response. Thus, dietary luteolin may be effective in Leydig cell tumor chemoprevention and in maintaining steroidogenesis in aging males.","A power law model for analyzing spatial patterns of vegetation abundance in terms of cover, biomass, density, and occurrence: derivation of a common rule.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201581,Journal of plant research,2019 06 15,"The cover, biomass, density, and frequencies of occurrence of individual species are important measures for characterizing plant communities. Examination of the statistical properties of vegetation data obtained through a quadrat survey provides insight into the spatial structure of plant communities and plant species diversity. In community analysis, we assume that x is theoretical variance calculated under the assumption that the abundance of a species follows a random distribution among quadrats (which we can obtain easily), and y is quadrat-to-quadrat variance calculated based on the observed data for a species. If the relationship y = Axb or logy = logA + blogx holds for two measurable traits of the plant community, x and y, the relationship is referred to as the power law, where A and b are constants. Then, an ideal index for measuring the spatial heterogeneity (δ) of the vegetation variable for each species was defined as δ = logy - logx. If δ = 0, the spatial heterogeneity of the species is random; if δ > 0, the heterogeneity exceeds a random pattern; and if δ < 0, the heterogeneity is less than a random pattern. In previous works in 2001 and 2014, we demonstrated that using the power law based on occurrence and density is a valuable approach to vegetation surveys and analyses. In this paper, the power law is mathematically extended and practical evidence is given for its application to cover and biomass of each species within a plant community. All measurements of cover, biomass, density, and frequency of occurrences were fitted to the power law, and plots of δ against the abundance values of these variables for each species in the community well described abundance and spatial pattern of each species in the environment. The power law is applicable not only to small-scale quadrats such as 50 × 50 cm but also to large-scale vegetation maps obtained using remote sensing and aerial photographic techniques.",A Cross-Sectional Examination of the Internalization of Emotion Co-regulatory Support in Children with ASD.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201578,Journal of autism and developmental disorders,2019 06 15,"Cross-sectional data from Fenning et al.

Few studies have focused on the behaviors of gynandromorphic spiders because of a scarcity of gynandromorphic individuals in the field. In this study, we collected a gynandromorphic spider, Myrmarachne formicaria (De Geer 1778) (Araneae: Salticidae), from the field and examined its morphology and sex-specific behavior in the laboratory. The right half of the gynandromorphic spider presented male characteristics and the left half female characteristics. It showed courtship behavior to M. formicaria females and agonistic behavior to the males. These results indicate that the gynandromorphic spider's sexual identity is male. Our findings suggest that a spider can exhibit behaviors of male sexuality, although the external morphology has the characteristics of both sexes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a gynandromorphic individual and its behavior in the genus Myrmarachne."

Quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP) is a complementary approach to traditional, target-centric pharmacology and drug discovery and is based on an iterative application of computational and systems biology methods with multiscale experimental methods, both of which include models of ADME-Tox and disease. QSP has emerged as a new approach due to the low efficiency of success in developing therapeutics based on the existing target-centric paradigm. Likewise, human microphysiology systems (MPS) are experimental models complementary to existing animal models and are based on the use of human primary cells, adult stem cells, and/or induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to mimic human tissues and organ functions/structures involved in disease and ADME-Tox. Human MPS experimental models have been developed to address the relatively low concordance of human disease and ADME-Tox with engineered, experimental animal models of disease.

FXR and its hepatic and intestinal target genes, small heterodimer partner (SHP, NR0B2) and fibroblast growth factor 15/19 (Fgf15 in mice, FGF19 in humans), transcriptionally regulate BA synthesis, detoxification, secretion, and absorption in the enterohepatic circulation. Furthermore, FXR modulates a large variety of physiological processes, such as lipid and glucose homeostasis as well as the inflammatory response. Targeted deletion of FXR renders mice highly susceptible to cholic acid feeding resulting in cholestatic liver injury, weight loss, and increased mortality. Combined deletion of FXR and SHP spontaneously triggers early-onset intrahepatic cholestasis in mice resembling human progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC). Reduced expression levels and activity of FXR have been reported in human cholestatic conditions, such as PFIC type 1 and intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy. Recently, two pairs of siblings with homozygous FXR truncation or deletion variants were identified. All four children suffered from severe, early-onset PFIC and liver failure leading to death or need for liver transplantation before the age of 2. These findings underscore the central role of FXR as regulator of systemic and hepatic BA levels. Therefore, targeting FXR has been exploited in different animal models of both intrahepatic and obstructive cholestasis, and the first FXR agonist obeticholic acid (OCA) has been approved for the treatment of primary biliary cholangitis (PBC). Further FXR agonists as well as a FGF19 analogue are currently tested in clinical trials for different cholestatic liver diseases. This chapter will summarize the current knowledge on the role of FXR in cholestasis both in rodent models and in human diseases.",The Pharmacology of Bile Acids and Their Receptors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201555,Handbook of experimental pharmacology,2019 06 15,"This review provides a historical perspective of bile acids and their receptors as therapeutic targets. Bile acids are atypical steroids generated by the liver from cholesterol and have been used for almost half a century for treating liver and biliary disorders. Since the early 1970s of the last century, chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), a primary bile acid, and ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), a secondary bile acid and the 7βepimer of CDCA, have been shown effective in promoting the dissolution of cholesterol gallstones. However, lack of activity and side effects associated with the use of CDCA, along with the advent of laparoscopic cholecystectomy, have greatly reduced the clinical relevance of this application. At the turn of the century, however, the discovery that bile acids activate specific receptors, along with the discovery that those receptors are placed at the interface of the host and intestinal microbiota regulating physiologically relevant enterohepatic and entero-pancreatic axes, has led to a ""bile acid renaissance."" Similarly to other steroids, bile acids bind and activate both cell surface and nuclear receptors, including the bile acid sensor farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and a G-protein-coupled bile acid receptor, known as GPBAR1 (TGR5). Both receptors have been proved druggable, and several highly potent, selective, and nonselective ligands for the two receptors have been discovered in the last two decades. Currently, in addition to obeticholic acid, a semisynthetic derivative of CDCA and the first in class of FXR ligands approved for clinical use, either selective or dual FXR and GPBAR1 ligands, have been developed, and some of them are undergoing pre-approval trials. The effects of FXR and GPBAR1 ligands in different therapeutic area are reviewed.","Chemistry and Pharmacology of GPBAR1 and FXR Selective Agonists, Dual Agonists, and Antagonists.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201554,Handbook of experimental pharmacology,2019 06 15,"In the recent years, bile acid receptors FXR and GPBAR1 have attracted the interest of scientific community and companies, as they proved promising targets for the treatment of several diseases, ranging from liver cholestatic disorders to metabolic syndrome, inflammatory states, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and diabetes.Consequently, the development of dual FXR/GPBAR1 agonists, as well as selective targeting of one of these receptors, is considered a hopeful possibility in the treatment of these disorders. Because endogenous bile acids and steroidal ligands, which cover the same chemical space of bile acids, often target both receptor families, speculation on nonsteroidal ligands represents a promising and innovative strategy to selectively target GPBAR1 or FXR.In this review, we summarize the most recent acquisition on natural, semisynthetic, and synthetic steroidal and nonsteroidal ligands, able to interact with FXR and GPBAR1.",Pharmacologic Modulation of Bile Acid-FXR-FGF15/FGF19 Pathway for the Treatment of Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201553,Handbook of experimental pharmacology,2019 06 15,"Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is within the spectrum of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and can progress to fibrosis, cirrhosis, and even hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The prevalence of NASH is rising and has become a large burden to the medical system worldwide. Unfortunately, despite its high prevalence and severe health consequences, there is currently no therapeutic agent approved to treat NASH. Therefore, the development of efficacious therapies is of utmost urgency and importance. Many molecular targets are currently under investigation for their ability to halt NASH progression. One of the most promising and well-studied targets is the bile acid (BA)-activated nuclear receptor, farnesoid X receptor (FXR). In this chapter, the characteristics, etiology, and prevalence of NASH will be discussed. A brief introduction to FXR regulation of BA homeostasis will be described. However, for more details regarding FXR in BA homeostasis, please refer to previous chapters. In this chapter, the mechanisms by which tissue and cell type-specific FXR regulates NASH development will be discussed in detail.

OCA, also known as 6-ethyl-CDCA or INT-747, was originally described by investigators at the Perugia University in 2002 as a selective ligand for the bile acid sensor, farnesoid-X-receptor (FXR). In addition to FXR and similarly to CDCA, OCA also activates GPBAR1/TGR5, a cell membrane G protein-coupled receptor for secondary bile acids. In 2016, based on the results of phase II studies showing efficacy in reducing the plasma levels of alkaline phosphatase, a surrogate biomarker for disease progression in primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), OCA has gained approval as a second-line treatment for PBC patients nonresponsive to UDCA. The use of OCA in PBC patients associates with several side effects, the most common of which is pruritus, whose incidence is dose-dependent and is extremely high when this agent is used as a monotherapy. Additionally, the use of OCA associates with the increased risk for the development of liver failure in cirrhotic PBC patients. Currently, OCA is investigated for its potential in the treatment of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Phase II and III trials have shown that OCA might attenuate the severity of liver fibrosis in patients with NASH, but it has no efficacy in reversing the steatotic component of the disease, while reduces the circulating levels of HDL-C and increases LDL-C. In summary, OCA has been the first-in-class of FXR ligands advanced to a clinical stage and is now entering its third decade of life, highlighting the potential benefits and risk linked to FXR-targeted therapies.",Understanding the Effects of Kidney Disease and Dialysis Treatment on Pharmacotherapy in Children.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201551,Handbook of experimental pharmacology,2019 06 15,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and acute kidney injury (AKI) requiring renal replacement therapy (RRT) by dialysis are rare conditions in pediatric patients.

In addition to the frequency and severity of heat stress conditions, the study further explores changes in the seasonality of heat stress. Four human thermal indices with different rationales were employed, namely the Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI), the Physiologically Equivalent Temperature (PET), the Heat Index (HI), and the Humidex (HD). All indices indicate a prominent increase in heat-related risk over the years. The exposure time per year under the conditions of ""hot-extreme caution"" (HI), ""great discomfort-avoid exertion"" (HD), ""very strong heat stress"" (UTCI), and ""extreme heat stress"" (PET) exhibits a statistically significant increasing trend at a rate of 0.9%/decade, 0.4%/decade, 0.3%/decade, and 0.4%/decade during 1960-2017, respectively. Even during the nighttime hours, three out of the four indices indicate that the population is exposed to significantly higher heat stress levels in the recent decades compared to the past ones.

This difference is a distinctive and universal adaptive pattern that emerges after puberty. We address whether this sexual dimorphism is cognitively and culturally represented to ground gender. To this end, we examine a non-Western, non-industrialized population, namely the Wichí (Salta, Argentina) and a Western industrialized population (Spain). The two cultural populations included both adults and prepubescent children. Across two experiments, we utilized a novel task with children and adults who had to make a choice for a female (male) target person between two identical objects that differed only in terms of their brightness. The results in both experiments revealed that the children from the two cultural communities choose a lighter colored object for the female target and a darker version of the same object for the male target. This pattern held across cultures irrespective of the age of participants, except for the male Wichí participants. We discuss how sexual dimorphism in skin color contributes to a universal grounding of the gender category, and advance possible explanations as to why Wichi males did not consistently link gender and brightness.",Cueing distraction: electrophysiological evidence for anticipatory active suppression of distractor location.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201532,Psychological research,2019 06 15,"It is well known that processing at upcoming target locations can be facilitated, but mixed results have been obtained regarding the inhibition of irrelevant locations when advance information about distractors is available on a trial-to-trial basis. Here, we provide electrophysiological evidence that distractor locations can be anticipatorily suppressed. In an additional singleton search task, distractor cues were presented before the search display, which were either fully predictive or non-predictive of the location of the upcoming salient colour distractor. The PD component of the event-related potential, a marker of active suppression, was elicited by lateral singletons and smaller following predictive than non-predictive cues, indicating that less suppression was required upon presentation of the distractor when its location was known in advance. Presumably, excitability of regions processing the predictively cued locations was anticipatorily reduced to prevent distraction. This idea was further supported by the finding that larger individual cueing benefits in reaction time were associated with stronger reductions of the PD. There was no behavioural benefit at the group level, however, and implications for the role of individual differences and for the measurement of inhibition in distractor cueing tasks are discussed. The enhancement of target locations, reflected by the NT component, was not modulated by the predictiveness of the cues. Overall, our findings add to a growing literature highlighting the importance of inhibitory mechanisms for the guidance of spatial attention by showing that irrelevant locations can be anticipatorily suppressed in a top-down fashion, reducing the impact of even salient stimuli.",Pollen development in male sterile mangosteen (Garcinia mangostana L.) and male fertile seashore mangosteen (Garcinia celebica L.).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201531,Protoplasma,2019 06 15,"Mangosteen (Garcinia mangostana L.) is an economically important tropical fruit, yet the reproductive biology of this dioecious plant is complex. Male trees are not known, and female trees have sterile anthers leading to apomixis. We hypothesized that pollen abortion in mangosteen is due to altered tapetum activity during microgametogenesis. Developmental events at the cellular and sub-cellular levels during pollen development in G. mangostana were therefore examined and compared with seashore mangosteen (G. celebica L.), a closely related species with fertile anthers. In G. mangostana, the microspore mother cell had disorganized cytoplasm, including lack of Golgi apparatus and its vesicles, as well as abnormal callose wall accumulation. Globular droplets, which resembled orbicules or Ubisch bodies, were abundant in the locule, including pre-Ubisch bodies found along the tapetal plasma membrane. The tapetum of G. mangostana underwent cell death earlier than the fertile G. celebica, and during the premature death, the mitochondria had dramatically altered shapes. Low accumulation of starch in collapsed microspore mother cells and tetrad cell remnants also suggested that altered cell metabolism is related to pollen abortion in mangosteen. The present results demonstrate the importance of coordinated development between the tapetum and microspores in pollen development and provide new insights into male sterility in mangosteen (G. mangostana).",Why are rhodanines less efficient reagents in Diels-Alder reactions than isorhodanines?

Here, we review recent theoretical and empirical literature regarding selection on complex traits to argue that ""missing heritability"" is as much an evolutionary problem as it is a statistical problem. We discuss empirical findings that suggest a role for selection in shaping the effect sizes and allele frequencies of causal variation underlying complex traits, and the limitations of these studies. We then use simulations of selection, realistic genome structure, and complex human demography to illustrate the results of recent theoretical work on polygenic selection, and show that statistical inference of causal loci is sharply affected by evolutionary processes. In particular, when selection acts on causal alleles, it hampers the ability to detect causal loci and constrains the transferability of GWAS results across populations.

This study aimed to profile cell lineage-specific MP in patients with RA, osteoarthritis (OA), and healthy controls (HC) in synovial fluid and circulation. Patients with RA (n = 40), OA (n = 30) and HC (n = 33) were included. Cell-free synovial fluid (SF) and platelet-poor plasma samples were stained with annexin V APC and antibodies against CD45, CD20, CD14, CD4, CD8, CD66b, and CD61 for multicolor flow cytometry. Mann-Whitney U test/unpaired T test was used to assess intergroup differences among RA and OA SF and clinical, serological phenotypes of RA based on normality distribution; Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn's multiple comparisons for comparing plasma MPs among RA, OA, and HC. Correlation between MP proportions and disease parameters was assessed by Spearman's correlation. The proportion of annexin V+ MP in SF of patients with RA [5 (6.35)] [median (IQR)] was higher compared to OA [1.8 (1.35), p < 0.001] and plasma of patients with RA [3.45 (5.63)] compared to OA [1.85 (1.4)] and HC [0.9 (1.1), p < 0.001]. Leukocyte-derived [0.85 (1.17)], granulocyte-derived [0.4 (2.05)], monocyte-derived [0.4 (0.4)], and T cell-derived MP [CD4+ - 0.1 (0.1); CD8+ - 0.1(0.1)] were higher in RA SF (p < 0.001). Platelet-derived MP (PMP) were the major fraction [1.5 (4.23), p < 0.001] in RA plasma. Leukocyte-derived MP were higher in RA plasma [0.1 (0.2); p < 0.001) than OA and HC. Annexin V+ MP and PMP were higher in the SF of RA with extra-articular manifestations (n = 15), as compared to those without (n = 25) (p = 0.02; p < 0.01, respectively). High SF granulocyte-derived MP were observed in patients with established RA (n = 24), ACPA-positive RA (n = 32) compared to their negative counterparts (p = 0.03; p = 0.02, respectively). Our observations of higher proportions of cell-derived MP in the plasma and synovial fluid of DMARD-naïve RA patients, their clinical and serological phenotypes suggest their role in dynamic cross talk between the joint and systemic circulation, disease pathology, and progression.",[Processing of interaural time differences in normal-hearing subjects and cochlear implant users with FSP and HDCIS coding strategy].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201511,HNO,2019 06 15,Sound localization is necessary for social interaction and remains challenging for bilateral cochlear implant (CI) users.

The objective of this study was to identify this metacestode, determine their prevalence and intensity and briefly assess the histopathological impact in the affected tissues. A parasitological study of 890 scallops over a 3-year period was performed in order to determine the parasite prevalence and intensity. Microscopical observation of details of the scolex and histopathological study of the affected host tissues were performed as well as molecular characterization of the parasite based on 18S and 28S rDNA sequences. The prevalence of the metacestode was 82.2% in August of 2013, 90.4% in November of 2014, and 83.1% and 85.6% in April and September of 2015, respectively. The highest average intensity (218.4) was found in spring of 2014. The histopathological study showed that plerocercoids reduced the gonadal space where the ovules develop. The molecular characterization and phylogenetic analysis revealed that the metacestodes belong to the genus Caulobothrium having high sequence similarity to Caulobothrium opisthorchis. This study constitutes the first report of Caulobothrium metacestodes in the scallop A. purpuratus.",Histologic Analysis with the Newly Designed Exoskeleton Seal® Stent-Graft in the Porcine Abdominal Aorta.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201508,Cardiovascular and interventional radiology,2019 06 15,To investigate the technical feasibility of a novel exoskeleton Seal® stent-graft and analyze early histologic changes in the porcine abdominal aorta.,Constitutional abnormality of nuclear membrane proteins in small cell lung carcinoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201505,Virchows Archiv : an international journal of pathology,2019 06 15,"Nuclear membrane proteins reportedly play important roles in maintaining nuclear structures and coordinating cell activities. Studying profiles of nuclear membrane proteins may help us evaluate the biological and/or clinical nature of malignant tumors. Using immunohistochemistry with antibodies for emerin, lamin A/C, lamin B, and LAP2, we examined 105 lung cancer tissues from 33 small cell lung carcinomas (SCLCs) and 72 non-SCLCs (34 adenocarcinomas, 30 squamous cell carcinomas, and 8 large cell carcinomas). Emerin had negative or local/weak positivity in 79% of SCLCs and 1% of non-SCLCs, and lamin A/C had similar positivity in 91% of SCLCs and 3% of non-SCLCs. LAP2's expression was similar between SCLCs and non-SCLCs. RT-PCR analyses for these four nuclear membrane proteins over 7 cell lines showed that mRNA of emerin and lamin A/C were distinctly downregulated in the SCLC cell lines, supporting the immunohistochemical results. In conclusion, we suggest that downregulation of the nuclear membrane proteins emerin and lamin A/C is characteristic of SCLC cells, and this constitutional abnormality of the nuclear membrane may be related to the biological and/or clinical nature of SCLC. In addition, knowing the nuclear protein profile in SCLC cells may contribute to our understanding of nuclear fragility known as the crush artifact in pulmonary biopsy specimens.",Performance of the minimally invasive autopsy tool for cause of death determination in adult deaths from the Brazilian Amazon: an observational study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201504,Virchows Archiv : an international journal of pathology,2019 06 15,"The uncertainty about the real burden of causes of death (CoD) is increasingly recognized by the international health community as a critical limitation for prioritizing effective public health measures. The minimally invasive autopsy (MIA) has shown to be a satisfactory substitute of the complete diagnostic autopsy (CDA), the gold standard for CoD determination in low- and middle-income countries. However, more studies are needed to confirm its adequate performance in settings with different epidemiology. In this observational study, the CoD obtained with the MIA were compared with the clinical diagnosis and the results of the CDA in 61 deaths that occurred in an infectious diseases referral hospital in Manaus, Brazilian Amazon. Concordance between the categories of diseases obtained by the three methods was evaluated by the Kappa statistic. Additionally, we evaluated discrepancies between clinical and complete diagnostic autopsy diagnoses. The MIA showed a substantial concordance with the CDA (Kappa = 0.777, 95% CI 0.608-0.946), and a perfect or almost perfect coincidence in specific diagnosis (ICD-10 code) between MIA and CDA was observed in 85% of the cases. In contrast, the clinical diagnosis showed a fair concordance with the CDA (Kappa = 0.311, 95% CI 0.071-0.552). Major clinico-pathological discrepancies were identified in 49% of cases. In conclusion, the MIA showed a substantial performance for CoD identification. Clinico-pathological discrepancies remain high and justify the need for post-mortem studies, even in referral hospitals. The MIA is a robust substitute of the CDA for CoD surveillance and quality improvement of clinical practice in low- and middle-income settings.",Sinusoidal and pericellular fibrosis in adult post-transplant liver biopsies: association with hepatic stellate cell activation and patient outcome.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201503,Virchows Archiv : an international journal of pathology,2019 06 15,"Post-transplant sinusoidal fibrosis (SF) and pericellular fibrosis (PCF) have not been extensively investigated in adults. Fifty-two post-transplant liver biopsies from 28 consented patients (12 men, mean age 49, range 33-67 years) were studied. Tissue morphology, including an arbitrary summative fibrosis score was assessed in detail. Collagen proportionate area (CPA) and alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) immunostain were evaluated by digital image analysis (DIA). Anti-keratin 7, anti-C4d and anti-sonic hedgehog (Shh) immunostains were scored semi-quantitatively. SF was observed in 36/52 (69.2%) biopsies and most of these (20/36, 55.6%) had centrilobular fibrosis (CLF). PCF was seen in 7/52 (13.5%) biopsies exclusively in cases with CLF. CPA was significantly correlated with time since liver transplantation (p = 0.043), summative fibrosis score and its main components but not with α-SMA. α-SMA-positive area significantly correlated with the Banff rejection score (p = 0.022) and centrilobular inflammatory changes were more severe in cases with CLF (p = 0.003). Hepatocyte ballooning of cholestatic type was associated with PCF (p = 0.016) and Shh expression (p < 0.001). Sinusoidal fibrosis is a frequent occurrence in post-transplant adult livers, with predilection toward centrilobular areas. Graft age and oxidative stress may contribute to SF development, while hepatocyte ballooning may be implicated in PCF development. Hepatic stellate cell (HSC) activation is likely affected by centrilobular inflammation.",Selenium does not affect radiosensitivity of breast cancer cell lines.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201502,Radiation and environmental biophysics,2019 06 15,"Supplementation with the antioxidant selenium is frequently performed in breast cancer patients to protect the normal tissue from radiation-induced side effects. However, concerns exist whether selenium also protects tumor cells from radiation-induced cell kill and thereby reduces the efficacy of radiotherapy. In this work, the effect of selenium administration on the radiosensitivity of breast cancer cells was evaluated in vitro. Physiological relevant selenium concentrations (70 and 140 µg/l) did not affect DNA double-strand breaks (γH2AX foci) after 4-Gy X-ray irradiation. Also apoptosis (caspase 3/7) after irradiation with 10 Gy was not influenced by selenium treatment in MDA-MB-231 and MCF7 cells. Most importantly, selenium supplementation did not impair the clonogenic survival of the breast cancer cell lines after irradiation (0, 2, 4, 6, 8 Gy). The data suggest that physiological relevant selenium concentrations administered in combination with radiation therapy do not deteriorate the efficacy of radiotherapy in breast cancer patients. However, randomized clinical trials comparing the effectiveness of radiotherapy and the associated side effects in patients with and without selenium supplementation are recommended.",Age estimation at death by the study of chest plate radiographs: establishing a Tunisian male score.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201501,International journal of legal medicine,2019 06 15,"We aim to establish a Tunisian score for age estimation through the study of chest plate's radiographs of a Tunisian male sample. We have focused on the study of 128 chest plate radiographs of Tunisian male individuals. We have established a score of eight criteria. The total score ranges from 8 to 32. Three observers scored double-blind the X-ray films. We studied the correlation of each criterion as well as the total score with chronological age for each observer. We also tested the reproducibility and the repeatability of criteria and total score. We calculated the estimated age for each score. We studied the relationship between the estimated age and the chronological age. The correlation between the total score and the chronological age has been good for the three observers (0.746, 0.756 and 0.742). The total score gives an estimation of age with a standard deviation of ± 5.88 years and a confidence interval of 95%, the interval's width increases gradually from 6.9 years to 23 years.",A case of suicide by double gunshot wounds to the head: the ability to act after the first shot.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201500,International journal of legal medicine,2019 06 15,"A single gunshot (or multiple) does (do) not necessarily lead to immediate loss of consciousness or rapid neurological deficits, so the victim may be able to repeatedly pull the trigger before achieving the lethal effect. Despite multiple gunshot wounds can lead to the suspicious participation of other person to the death of the victim, in the medico-legal literature suicides with multiple gunshot wounds are reported, demonstrating the ability of the victim to act after two or more gunshots. In this case, a 47-years-old man was found dead in a pool of blood in the kitchen of his house. According to findings and analysis, the victim modified a single-shot, pneumatic toy gun branded ""Condor"" Cal. 7 mm (a gun that is made mainly with ""ZAMAK"" zinc-based alloy, designed to shoot one soft-polymer bullet at a time, with an initial kinetic energy lower than 1 Joule) into an improvised firearm weapon. With this gun, the victim achieved shooting of two bullets into his head, both entering from the right temporal region of his head, with one stopped in the left occipital lobe and the other one in the left temporal lobe. His death was caused by cranium-meningo-encephalic gunshot wounds. The conditions supporting the hypothesis that the victim was able to fire two shots to his head before the onset of incapacitation (the type of bullets used, the location of injuries and their consequences) and the characteristics that typically allow to distinguish the manner of death (suicide vs homicide) were evaluated. Based on all the collected elements, it was possible to confirm that suicide was the manner of death. This case underlines the importance of evaluating all available elements (post-mortem imaging, autopsy and toxicological findings, ballistics and neuropathological evaluations) to distinguish suicide from homicide and to prevent incorrect conclusions."

Not only perioperative myocardial infarction but also myocardial injury after non-cardiac surgery, which presents without clinical symptoms, is associated with an adverse outcome. Patients at risk require particular interdisciplinary attention throughout the perioperative phase. The premedication visit is of particular importance. In addition to a thorough patient medical history and physical assessment, the perioperative handling of the patient's pre-existing medication and possible necessity for further preoperative tests should be verified. If necessary and where possible, optimization of the patient's state of health can be planned together with other disciplines. It is the anesthesiologist's responsibility to optimally guide and support patients with pre-existing cardiovascular diseases through the entire surgical procedure. This review summarizes perioperative interventions that have an influence on patient mortality and morbidity and evaluates the underlying evidence. This covers the perioperative handling of cardioprotective medication, choice of the anesthetic regimen, blood pressure management and transfusion regimens. Furthermore, this review highlights recent findings, e.g. perioperative reloading with statins and short-term preoperative initiation of beta blockers. The pros and cons of thoracic epidural anesthesia in patients with an elevated cardiovascular risk are discussed. Not only intraoperative hypotension should be of concern to anesthesiologists but also postoperative hypotension can have a deleterious impact on the outcome. This is relevant in the time period when a significant proportion of patients have already left the monitoring ward. The recently published recommendations by the World Health Organization concerning perioperative hyperoxia might not be beneficial for patients with an elevated cardiovascular risk. Finally, the treatment options for perioperative cardiovascular events are explained and an algorithm for handling of patients with perioperative myocardial injury without clinical ischemic symptoms is suggested (myocardial injury after non-cardiac surgery).",Cannabinoid modulation of opioid analgesia and subjective drug effects in healthy humans.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201479,Psychopharmacology,2019 06 15,Dozens of preclinical studies have reported cannabinoid agonist potentiation of the analgesic effects of μ-opioid agonists.,Toward an animal model of borderline personality disorder.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201478,Psychopharmacology,2019 06 15,"Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a pervasive psychiatric disorder characterized by emotion dysregulation, impulsivity, impaired self-perceptions, and interpersonal relationships and currently affects 1-3% of the US population as reported by Torgersen et al.

The PFC and the hippocampus have been shown to play a fundamental role in cognition, and studies in dysbindin-1 null mice have shown alterations in NMDAR located in pyramidal neurons as well as perturbation in LTP and cognitive deficits. The balance between excitatory and inhibitory transmission is crucial for normal cognitive functions; however, there is a dearth of information regarding the effects of loss of dysbindin-1 in GABAergic transmission. Using in vitro whole-cell clamp recordings, Western blots, and immunohistochemistry, we report here that dysbindin-1-deficient mice exhibit a significant decrease in the frequency of sIPSCs and in the amplitude of mIPSCs and significant decreases in PV staining and protein level. These results suggest that loss of dysbindin-1 affects GABAergic transmission at pre- and postsynaptic level and decreases parvalbumin markers."

The differential pulse voltammetric (DPV) method using boron doped diamond electrode (BDDE), based on characteristic oxidation peaks, was proposed and successfully applied. The linearity range was within 5.0 × 10-6 to 5.0 × 10-5 M of brimonidine, and limit of detection and limit of quantitation were 1.94 × 10-6 M and 6.46 × 10-6 M, respectively. Intra-day and inter-day precision and accuracy were evaluated and all results were in accordance with validation ICH guidelines. The best short-term stability study results were obtained for a concentration level of 3.0 × 10-5 M expressed by deviation of + 1.86% between initial and post storage concentrations. A long-term stability study was performed for two concentrations of 3.0 × 10-5 M and 5.0 × 10-5 M and resulted in deviations of + 1.63% and + 3.56%, respectively. A freeze and thaw stability study indicated that samples might be frozen only once. The enhancement of DPV/BDDE method sensitivity gained by modification, for the analysis of immeasurable BRIM quantities in native, untreated aqueous humor, was reached for quantities of 6 or 12 nmol/0.1 mL aqueous humor with acceptable accuracy (up to + 7.5%). The nature of the process-the irreversible one electron oxidation voltammetric peak of BRIM-limited the sensitivity. Only electrochemical pre-treatment of the BDD electrode before each measurement significantly speeded up the whole procedure. The advantages of the proposed method are simplicity, short-time performance, and good specificity/selectivity, as well as satisfactory accuracy, and no chemical modification of BDDE was necessary.",Efficiency comparison of the imidazole plus RNO method for singlet oxygen detection in biorelevant solvents.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201461,Analytical and bioanalytical chemistry,2019 06 15,"Singlet oxygen (1O2) is the focus of study in many fields, including phototoxicity, antioxidant activity, pollutant weathering, photodynamic therapy, and water disinfection. The imidazole plus RNO (Imd/RNO) method, originated by Kraljic and El Mohsni, is commonly used to monitor singlet oxygen production. In this method, 1O2 is quenched by an acceptor, imidazole (Imd), during the formation of a trans-annular peroxide intermediate that bleaches the sensor, p-nitrosodimethylaniline (RNO). Though the method has been widely used, including to monitor 1O2 production in complex environments, such as surfactants and cells, studies reporting the efficiency of the assay in complex solvents have not been reported. In this research, the Imd/RNO method in complex, biorelevant solvents, i.e., sodium dodecyl sulfate, octanol, and phosphate buffer-saturated octanol, was compared with reference solvents, i.e., phosphate buffer, ethanol, and methanol, for monitoring 1O2 produced by Rose Bengal photosensitization using time-resolved, broadband UV-Vis absorbance measurements. Rates of sensor bleaching and sensitizer photodegradation were simultaneously monitored in each solvent to investigate correlations between the disappearance rates of sensor and sensitizer. The quantum yields of 1O2 production (ϕ∆) in each solvent were calculated using a relative actinometric method. The dependence of sensor bleaching and sensitizer degradation on acceptor concentration and solvent polarity, and the results of assay controls suggest mechanistic differences underlying the reactions comprising the Imd/RNO method.

As endogenous urea is normally released to body cavities, we sought to investigate the usefulness of UBT without 13C-labelled external urea to detect H. pylori infection. The analysis was performed in a series of adult patients just before upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and biopsy to investigate dyspeptic symptoms. Breath samples were analyzed using isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS). The natural variation of 13C and 18O isotopic abundance in the breath samples was also investigated. The results of the isotopic analysis were compared with the findings of the histopathological evaluation of gastric biopsies, which is the gold standard to detect H. pylori infection. No differences between patients with or without H. pylori infection could be detected by the isotope analysis of breath tests without 13C-urea. Therefore, our results showed that UBT without 13C-urea, analyzed by IRMS, was not useful to detect H. pylori infection in the study population.",Evaluating the treatment effectiveness of copper-based algaecides on toxic algae Microcystis aeruginosa using single cell-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201458,Analytical and bioanalytical chemistry,2019 06 15,"Single cell-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (SC-ICP-MS) is an emerging technology. In this work, we have developed a novel SC-ICP-MS method to quantify metal ions in individual cells of a toxic cyanobacterial species, Microcystis aeruginosa (M. aeruginosa), without complicated post-dosing sample preparation, and applied this method to study the treatment effectiveness of copper-based algaecides (cupric sulfate and EarthTec®) on the toxic algae M. aeruginosa. The developed SC-ICP-MS method uses new intrinsic metal element magnesium to determine real transport efficiency and cell concentration. The cell viability and microcystin-LR release by algaecide treatment were studied by flow cytometry and ultra-fast liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, respectively. The results showed that this novel method was very rapid, highly sensitive (detection limits of intracellular copper and magnesium were 65 ag/cell and 98 ag/cell, respectively), and reproducible (relative standard deviation within 12%). The algaecide effectiveness study further demonstrated that copper in the forms of cupric sulfate and copper-based algaecide EarthTec® successfully diminished M. aeruginosa populations. The higher the copper concentration used to treat the cells, the faster the speeds of copper uptake and cell lysis in the copper concentrations ranged from 0 to 200 μg/L of copper-based algaecide. The cells exhibit obvious heterogeneity in copper uptake. The result suggests that M. aeruginosa cells uptake and cumulate copper followed by cellular lysis and microcystin-LR release. These novel results indicated that though the copper-based algaecides could control this type of harmful algal bloom, further treatment to remove the released algal toxin from the treated water would be needed.

To further validate our findings and to monitor the biological impact of stress in research of clinical psychiatry, a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method was developed to simultaneously determine a panel of biomarkers comprising choline, creatine, purinergic metabolites, neurosteroids, lysophosphatidylcholines, and phosphatidylethanolamines in human plasma. After optimization of the extraction protocol, all the 15 analytes plus 4 internal standards with distinct polarities were extracted into an organic phase using methyl tert-butyl ether/methanol (1:1, v/v). A reversed-phase C8 column under gradient elution consisting of aqueous phase A of 5 mM ammonium acetate buffer solution containing 0.1% formic acid and organic phase B of acetonitrile/2-propanol (3:7, v/v) was utilized for separation. Four sequential periods under positive or negative ion mode were combined for the determination of analytes with specific multiple reaction monitoring transitions. For all analytes, this method exhibited good linearity with coefficients of determination (R2) higher than 0.99. The lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) values ranged from 0.05 to 80.0 ng/mL. Recovery between 70.5 and 97.3% was obtained by spiking standards to plasma samples stripped by powdered activated carbon. The intra- and inter-assay relative standard deviations (RSDs) of the analyses varied between 2.0 and 13.3%. The mean accuracy ranged from 90.6 to 109.0%. The matrix effect ranged from 91.2 to 107.3% with variations less than 9.0%. Stability under different conditions was tested, with mean recoveries varying between 90.4 and 109.7%. Finally, the established method was successfully applied to analyze the plasma samples from a small cohort of 30 patients with major depressive disorder and 30 matched healthy controls.

The method allows for the simultaneous monitoring of sum compositions in MS1 and up to 48 lipids in MS2 per lipid class. A total of 240 lipid sum compositions from five phospholipid classes could be monitored in MS2 (HR-SRM/MS) while there was no limitation in the number of analytes in MS1 (HR-SIM/MS). On average, 92 lipid sum compositions and 75 lipid species could be quantified in human plasma samples. The robustness and precision of the workflow has been assessed using technical triplicates of the subject samples. Lipid identification was improved using a combined qualitative and quantitative data processing based on prediction instead of library search. Lipid class specific extracted ion currents of precursors and the corresponding molecular species fragments were extracted based on the information obtained from lipid building blocks and a combinatorial strategy. The SWATH/MS approach with the post-acquisition processing is not limited to the analyzed phospholipid classes and can be applied to other analytes and samples of interest. Graphical abstract.",Correlations between odour activity and the structural modifications of acrylates.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201455,Analytical and bioanalytical chemistry,2019 06 15,"Acrylates (acrylic esters) are versatile monomers that are widely used in polymer formulations because of their highly reactive α,β-unsaturated carboxyl structure. Commonly used acrylates such as butyl acrylate are known to emit a strong unpleasant odour, and the monomers are therefore potential off-odorants in acrylic polymers. However, up to now, the odour properties of structurally related acrylic esters have not been characterised in detail. To obtain deeper insights into the smell properties of different acrylates, we investigated the relationship between the molecular structure and odour thresholds as well as the odour qualities of 20 acrylic esters, nine of these synthesised here for the first time. The OT values of 16 acrylates fell within the range from 0.73 to 20 ng/Lair, corresponding to a high-odour activity. Moreover, sec-butyl acrylate and 2-methoxyphenyl acrylate showed even lower OT values of 0.073 and 0.068, respectively. On the other hand, the OT values of the hydroxylated acrylates 2-hydroxyethyl acrylate and 2-hydroxypropyl acrylate were 5-244 times higher than those of the other compounds, demonstrating that the presence of a hydroxyl group obviously favours odour inactivity.",LC-MS-based lipid profile in colorectal cancer patients: TAGs are the main disturbed lipid markers of colorectal cancer progression.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201454,Analytical and bioanalytical chemistry,2019 06 15,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common causes of cancer-related death worldwide. Emerging evidence has shown that lipid metabolism plays important roles in the occurrence and progression of CRC. The identification of potential biomarkers for CRC progression is critical for precise diagnosis and treatment. Therefore, the aim of this study is to explore the potential lipid markers in relation to CRC progression. The plasma of patients with stage I/II CRC (n = 20) and stage III/IV CRC (n = 20) was collected. Lipidomic screening was performed by ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. After multivariate data analysis, including orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis, determination of the fold change, and the Mann-Whitney U test, eight lipid species with altered levels with p < 0.05 and fold change greater than 2 were selected as potential lipid biomarkers. Compared with patients with early-stage CRC, patients with advanced-stage CRC showed significantly higher levels of cholesteryl ester (20:4) and some triglycerides with a saturated fatty acid chain and a lower level of fatty acid ester of hydroxy fatty acid 27:1 (9:0-18:1) in plasma. Furthermore, the receiver operating characteristic including these potential lipid biomarkers yielded a sensitivity of 85% and specificity of 80% for separation of early-stage CRC patients from advanced-stage CRC patients. In all, this is the first report showing that the levels of triglycerides, the major contents of lipid droplets, increase in plasma of advanced-stage CRC patients compared with early-stage CRC patients. These data indicate that lipid droplets may be target organelles for the study of CRC progression and treatment.

In this study, Runella slithyformis Runsl_4512 and Dyadobacter fermentans Dfer_5652 were characterized from a cluster of uncharacterized proteins of the acylglucosamine 2-epimerase (AGE) superfamily. These proteins catalyzed the intramolecular conversion of D-mannose to D-glucose, whereas they did not act on β-(1 → 4)-mannobiose, N-acetyl-D-glucosamine, and D-fructose, which are substrates of known AGE superfamily members. The kcat/Km values of Runsl_4512 and Dfer_5652 for D-mannose epimerization were 3.89 and 3.51 min-1 mM-1, respectively. Monitoring the Runsl_4512 reaction through 1H-NMR showed the formation of β-D-glucose and β-D-mannose from D-mannose and D-glucose, respectively. In the reaction with β-D-glucose, β-D-mannose was produced at the initial stage of the reaction, but not in the reaction with α-D-glucose. These results indicate that Runsl_4512 catalyzed the 2-epimerization of the β-anomer substrate with a net retention of the anomeric configuration. Since 2H was obviously detected at the 2-C position of D-mannose and D-glucose in the equilibrated reaction mixture produced by Runsl_4512 in 2H2O, this enzyme abstracts 2-H from the substrate and adds another proton to the intermediate. This mechanism is in accordance with the mechanism proposed for the reactions of other epimerases of the AGE superfamily, that is, AGE and cellobiose 2-epimerase. Upon reaction with 500 g/L D-glucose at 50 °C and pH 8.0, Runsl_4512 and Dfer_5652 produced D-mannose with a 24.4 and 22.8% yield, respectively. These D-mannose yields are higher than those of other enzyme systems, and ME acts as an efficient biocatalyst for producing D-mannose.",Updates in understanding the hypocholesterolemia effect of probiotics on atherosclerosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201452,Applied microbiology and biotechnology,2019 06 15,"Atherosclerosis is the major cause of cardiovascular diseases, which are considered the fatal ailment globally. Hypercholesterolaemia plays a critical role in the development of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular diseases. Many studies have been stated that probiotics could affect hypercholesterolemia via cholesterol metabolism. Probiotics are live bacteria which are good for our health when administered orally in high amounts. Recently, many studies have revealed the beneficial effects of the nutritional ingestion of probiotics which can decrease serum cholesterol levels. The aim of this review is, firstly, to explore the hypercholesterolemia effect of how it progresses into atherosclerosis and, secondly, to summarize the hypocholesterolaemia effect of probiotics on atherosclerosis and the up-to-date information on their basic mechanisms. The most important mechanisms responsible for the hypocholesterolemic effect of probiotics are the suppression of the reabsorption of bile acids and inhibition of the intestinal cholesterol absorption. Current studies indicate that numerous mechanisms within the cholesterol metabolism, e.g., ones involving the Niemann-Pick C1-Like 1 protein, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase, and 7α- and 27α-hydroxylases, have been recommended where regulation may take place after oral intake of probiotics. However, these mechanisms are still poorly understood. Thus, further studies are required to examine the possible mechanisms, whereby probiotics can be utilized safely and considered for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia."

[et al.],2019 06 15,"The past decade has witnessed a surge in research centered around exploring the role of the enigmatic innate immune-like lymphocyte MAIT cell in human disease. Recent evidence has led to the elucidation of its role as a potent defender at mucosal surfaces including lungs due to its capacity to mount a formidable immediate response to bacterial pathogens. MAIT cells have a unique attribute of recognizing microbial ligands in conjunction with non-classical MHC-related protein MR1. Recent studies have demonstrated their contribution in the pathogenesis of chronic pulmonary disorders including asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Several cellular players including innate immune cells are active contributors in the immune imbalance present in cystic fibrosis(CF) lung. This immune dysregulation serves as a central pivot in disease pathogenesis, responsible for causing immense structural damage in the CF lung. The present review focuses on understanding the role of MAIT cells in CF lung disease. Future studies directed at understanding the possible relationship between MAIT cells and regulatory T cells (Tregs) in CF lung disease could unravel a holistic picture where a combination of antimicrobial effects of MAIT cells and anti-inflammatory effects of Tregs could be exploited in synergy to alleviate the rapid deterioration of lung function in CF lung disease due to the underlying complex interplay between persistent infection and inflammation.",Effects of dietary and physical activity interventions on the risk of type 2 diabetes in South Asians: meta-analysis of individual participant data from randomised controlled trials.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201437,Diabetologia,2019 06 15,"Individuals of South Asian origin have a high risk of type 2 diabetes and of dying from a diabetes-attributable cause.

Rectal cancer PET/MRI protocols typically include dedicated pelvis bed positions utilizing small field-of-view T2-weighted imaging. For staging of the primary tumor, PET/MRI can help delineate the extent of tumor better as well as the extent of tumor beyond the muscularis propria. PET uptake may help characterize small lymph nodes, and the use of hepatobiliary phase imaging can improve the detection of small hepatic metastases. The most beneficial aspect of PET/MRI may be in treatment response, although current data are limited on how to combine PET and MRI data in this setting. Limitations of PET/MRI include the inability to detect small pulmonary nodules and issues related to attenuation correction, although the development of new attenuation correction techniques may address this issue.

In this context, the use of antioxidant compounds could provide neuroprotection and help to reduce the damage caused by epileptic seizures and thereby the use of anticonvulsant drugs. Rosmarinic acid (RA) is an ester of caffeic acid and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylactic acid that prevents cell damage caused by free radicals, acting as an antioxidant. It also presents anti-inflammatory, antimutagenic, and antiapoptotic properties. In this work, we used two models of acute seizure, 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) and picrotoxin (PTX)-induced seizures in mice, to investigate the anticonvulsant, antioxidant, and neuroprotective profile of RA. Diazepam and valproic acid, antiepileptic drugs already used in the treatment of epilepsy, were used as positive controls. Although RA could not prevent seizures in the models used in this study, neither enhance the latency time to first seizure at the tested doses, it exhibited an antioxidant and neuroprotective effect. RA (8 and 16 mg/kg) decreased reactive oxygen species production, superoxide dismutase activity, and DNA damage, measured in hippocampus, after seizures induced by PTX and 4-AP. Catalase activity was decreased by RA only after seizures induced by 4-AP. The activity of the mitochondrial complex II was increased by RA in hippocampus samples after both seizure models. The results obtained in this study suggest that RA is able to reduce cell damage generated by the 4-AP and PTX seizures and therefore could represent a potential candidate in reducing pathophysiological processes involved in epilepsy."

We previously identified 7 novel proteins that could enhance onchocerciasis sero-diagnosis. Further screening by luciferase immunoprecipitation assays identified OVOC10469 and OVOC3261 as the most promising candidates. IgG4-based ELISA using recombinant proteins, yielded sensitivities of 53% for rOVOC10469 and 78% for rOVOC3261, while specificity for each was >99%. Moreover, the newly-identified biomarkers detected some (but not all) of the mf-positive samples not detected by OV-16. The new antigens in combination with OV-16, increased the sensitivity for patent infections to 94%, demonstrating the benefits of adding a complementary antigen to OV-16-based serology. The kinetics of appearance of these IgG4 responses based on experimentally infected non-human primates indicated that they were patency driven. Of note, the IgG4 responses to both OVOC10469 and OVOC3261 (as well as to OV-16) drop significantly (p<0.05) following successful treatment for onchocerciasis. A prototype of a lateral flow rapid assay was developed and tested, showing an overall 94% sensitivity.

We next used MS2-RIP assays to demonstrate that lncRNA-m433s1 interacted with miR-433. Furthermore, we detected the levels of lncRNA-m433s1, lncRNA-miR-433 and Fshβ expression, FSH concentrations, and apoptosis upon overexpression and knockdown of lncRNA-m433s1, revealing that lncRNA-m433s1 upregulated Fshβ expression. Globally, lncRNA-m433s1 reduced the inhibitory effect of miR-433 on Fshβ and further regulated FSH secretion as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) by sponging miR-433. This ceRNA model will provide novel insight into the regulatory mechanisms of lncRNAs associated with rat reproduction.","The pivotal roles of the NOD-like receptors with a PYD domain, NLRPs, in oocytes and early embryo development.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201414,Biology of reproduction,2019 06 15,"Nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors with a pyrin domain (PYD), NLRPs, are pattern-recognition receptors, well recognized for their important roles in innate immunity and apoptosis. However, several NLRPs have received attention for their new, specialized roles as maternally contributed genes important in reproduction and embryo development. Several NLRPs have been shown to be specifically expressed in oocytes and preimplantation embryos. Interestingly, and in line with divergent functions, NLRP genes reveal a complex evolutionary divergence. The most pronounced difference is the human-specific NLRP7 gene, not identified in rodents. However, mouse models have been extensively used to study maternally contributed NLRPs. The NLRP2 and NLRP5 proteins are components of the subcortical maternal complex (SCMC), which was recently identified as essential for mouse preimplantation development. The SCMC integrates multiple proteins, including KHDC3L, NLRP5, TLE6, OOEP, NLRP2, and PADI6. The NLRP5 (also known as MATER) has been extensively studied. In humans, inactivating variants in specific NLRP genes in the mother are associated with distinct phenotypes in the offspring, such as biparental hydatidiform moles (BiHMs) and preterm birth. Maternal-effect recessive mutations in KHDC3L and NLRP5 (and NLRP7) are associated with reduced reproductive outcomes, BiHM, and broad multi-locus imprinting perturbations. The precise mechanisms of NLRPs are unknown, but research strongly indicates their pivotal roles in the establishment of genomic imprints and post-zygotic methylation maintenance, among other processes. Challenges for the future include translations of findings from the mouse model into human contexts and implementation in therapies and clinical fertility management.",Assessment and comparison of sleep patterns among medical and non-medical undergraduates of Karachi: A cross-sectional study - SPECIAL REPORT.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201409,JPMA.

Other than microRNAs, serum Glial Fibrillary Acid Protein, cytokines and YLK-40, as well as a number of other candidate serum biomarkers are being studied.More studies, with larger sample sizes are required before these serum biomarkers can be routinely, and reliably used in clinical practice.

Here, we show that NDP52 regulates spindle orientation via remodeling the polar cortical actin cytoskeleton. siRNA-mediated NDP52 suppression surprisingly revealed a ring-like compact subcortical F-actin architecture surrounding the spindle in prophase/prometaphase cells, which resulted in severe defects of astral microtubule growth and an aberrant spindle orientation. Remarkably, NDP52 recruited the actin assembly factor N-WASP and regulated the dynamics of the subcortical F-actin ring in mitotic cells. Mechanistically, NDP52 was found to bind to phosphatidic acid-containing vesicles, which absorbed cytoplasmic N-WASP to regulate local filamentous actin growth at the polar cortex. Our TIRFM analyses revealed that NDP52-containing vesicles anchored N-WASP and shortened the length of actin filaments in vitro. Based on these results we propose that NDP52-containing vesicles regulate cortical actin dynamics through N-WASP to accomplish a spatiotemporal regulation between astral microtubules and the actin network for proper spindle orientation and precise chromosome segregation. In this way, intracellular vesicles cooperate with microtubules and actin filaments to regulate proper mitotic progression. Since NDP52 is absent from yeast, we reason that metazoans have evolved an elaborate spindle positioning machinery to ensure accurate chromosome segregation in mitosis.",BubR1 phosphorylates CENP-E as a switch enabling the transition from lateral association to end-on capture of spindle microtubules.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201382,Cell research,2019 06 15,"Error-free mitosis depends on accurate chromosome attachment to spindle microtubules, powered congression of those chromosomes, their segregation in anaphase, and assembly of a spindle midzone at mitotic exit. The centromere-associated kinesin motor CENP-E, whose binding partner is BubR1, has been implicated in congression of misaligned chromosomes and the transition from lateral kinetochore-microtubule association to end-on capture. Although previously proposed to be a pseudokinase, here we report the structure of the kinase domain of Drosophila melanogaster BubR1, revealing its folding into a conformation predicted to be catalytically active. BubR1 is shown to be a bona fide kinase whose phosphorylation of CENP-E switches it from a laterally attached microtubule motor to a plus-end microtubule tip tracker. Computational modeling is used to identify bubristatin as a selective BubR1 kinase antagonist that targets the αN1 helix of N-terminal extension and αC helix of the BubR1 kinase domain. Inhibition of CENP-E phosphorylation is shown to prevent proper microtubule capture at kinetochores and, surprisingly, proper assembly of the central spindle at mitotic exit. Thus, BubR1-mediated CENP-E phosphorylation produces a temporal switch that enables transition from lateral to end-on microtubule capture and organization of microtubules into stable midzone arrays.",Interferon-λ orchestrates innate and adaptive mucosal immune responses.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201377,Nature reviews.

In this Review, we highlight recent work showing that IFN-λ inhibits virus dissemination within the body and limits the transmission of respiratory and gastrointestinal viruses to naive hosts. We also discuss findings indicating that IFN-λ can act on neutrophils to prevent invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. We summarize results showing that IFN-λ signalling differs in several respects from IFN-α and IFN-β signalling, particularly in neutrophils.

This paper describes molecular and clinical details of 16 probands with developmental disorders and de novo CNOT3 variants. It is the first such description of the developmental phenotype associated with CNOT3 variants. Eight of these cases were discovered as part of the DDD study, while the other eight were found as a result of large-scale sequencing work performed by other groups. A highly specific phenotype was not recognised in these 16 cases. The most consistent phenotypic features seen in subjects with de novo variants in CNOT3 were hypotonia, relatively small stature, developmental delay, behavioural problems and intellectual disability. There is no easily recognisable facial phenotype, but some common dysmorphic features such as anteverted nares, thin upper lip and low set eyebrows were shared among some of the probands. Haploinsufficiency appears to be the most likely mechanism of action, with eight cases found to have protein-truncating variants. Of the other eight cases (all missense variants), three share an amino acid substitution at the same position which may therefore represent an important functional domain.",Conceptualizing mental disorders as deviations from normative functioning.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201374,Molecular psychiatry,2019 06 15,"Normative models are a class of emerging statistical techniques useful for understanding the heterogeneous biology underlying psychiatric disorders at the level of the individual participant. Analogous to normative growth charts used in paediatric medicine for plotting child development in terms of height or weight as a function of age, normative models chart variation in clinical cohorts in terms of mappings between quantitative biological measures and clinically relevant variables. An emerging body of literature has demonstrated that such techniques are excellent tools for parsing the heterogeneity in clinical cohorts by providing statistical inferences at the level of the individual participant with respect to the normative range. Here, we provide a unifying review of the theory and application of normative modelling for understanding the biological and clinical heterogeneity underlying mental disorders. We first provide a statistically grounded yet non-technical overview of the conceptual underpinnings of normative modelling and propose a conceptual framework to link the many different methodological approaches that have been proposed for this purpose. We survey the literature employing these techniques, focusing principally on applications of normative modelling to quantitative neuroimaging-based biomarkers in psychiatry and, finally, we provide methodological considerations and recommendations to guide future applications of these techniques. We show that normative modelling provides a means by which the importance of modelling individual differences can be brought from theory to concrete data analysis procedures for understanding heterogeneous mental disorders and ultimately a promising route towards precision medicine in psychiatry.",Effects of hypertonia on contracture development in rat spinal cord injury.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201373,Spinal cord,2019 06 15,Experimental animal study.,The EQ-5D-5L in patients admitted to a hospital in Japan with recent spinal cord injury: a descriptive study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201371,Spinal cord,2019 06 15,Descriptive study.,A DSTYK mutation activates ERK1/2 signaling to promote intraspinal dissemination in a case of solitary fibrous tumor/hemangiopericytoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201369,Laboratory investigation; a journal of technical methods and pathology,2019 06 15,"Intracranial solitary fibrous tumors/hemangiopericytomas (SFT/HPCs) are vascular tumors that have a high rate of local recurrence and extracranial metastases. Intradural extramedullary spinal dissemination of intracranial SFT/HPC is extremely rare. There is a paucity of data available to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of intraspinal dissemination of intracranial SFT/HPC. Herein, we presented a case of intracranial SFT/HPC with intraspinal metastasis. The resected tumor specimens were enrolled in a clinical sequencing program, including whole-exome and transcriptome sequencing. By comparing genomic sequencing data of the intracranial tumors with intraspinal metastasis, we established the somatic mutational profiles of these tumors. Clonality analysis revealed a distinct subclonal structure in the intracranial tumor and its intraspinal metastasis, which might reflect the possibility of intratumoral clonal selection and evolution during the process of tumor dissemination. Through bioinformatics analysis and Sanger sequencing validation, a DSTYK mutation (Met296Ile) was identified as a candidate driver of intraspinal metastasis in this SFT/HPC case. Further, an intracranial tumor-derived SFT/HPC cell line, HPC3, was established to explore the mechanisms of the DSTYK mutation in promoting SFT/HPC metastasis. Based on the HPC3 cell model, we found that the DSTYK mutation promoted cell migration and invasion of HPC3 cells via activation of ERK1/2 signaling, which was inhibited by the MEK/ERK inhibitor AZD6244. The DSTYK mutation was also shown to upregulate the expression of two metastasis-related molecules: MMP2 and MMP9 in HPC3 cells; however, this effect was attenuated by AZD6244 treatment. Therefore, the DSTYK mutation may activate ERK1/2/MMP2/9 signaling to promote tumor cell metastasis in SFT/HPC. In conclusion, our study revealed the potential role of DSTYK mutation in the regulation of intraspinal metastasis of SFT/HPC, which might provide new biological insights into this rare disease.",Microvascularity detection and quantification in glioma: a novel deep-learning-based framework.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201368,Laboratory investigation; a journal of technical methods and pathology,2019 06 15,"Microvascularity is highly correlated with the grading and subtyping of gliomas, making this one of its most important histological features. Accurate quantitative analysis of microvessels is helpful for the development of a targeted therapy for antiangiogenesis. The deep-learning algorithm is by far the most effective segmentation and detection model and enables location and recognition of complex microvascular networks in large images obtained from hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained specimens. We proposed an automated deep-learning-based method to detect and quantify the microvascularity in glioma and applied it to comprehensive clinical analyses. A total of 350 glioma patients were enrolled in our study, for which digitalized imaging of H&E stained slides were reviewed, molecular diagnosis was performed and follow-up was investigated. The microvascular features were compared according to their histologic types, molecular types, and patients' prognosis. The results show that the proposed method can quantify microvascular characteristics automatically and effectively. Significant increases of microvascular density and microvascular area were observed in glioblastomas (95% p < 0.001 in density, 170% p < 0.001 in area) in comparison with other histologic types; increases were also observed in cases with TERT-mut only (68% p < 0.001 in density, 54% p < 0.001 in area) compared with other molecular types. Survival analysis showed that microvascular features can be used to cluster cases into two groups with different survival periods (hazard ratio [HR] 2.843, log-rank <0.001), which indicates the quantified microvascular features may potentially be alternative signatures for revealing patients' prognosis. This deep-learning-based method may be a useful tool in routine clinical practice for precise diagnosis and antiangiogenic treatment."

Many studies only sample surface soils, and may therefore miss important variation of deeper soil levels. We aimed to identify a critical soil depth in which the relationships between soil properties and P&CA were strongest due to an ideal interplay among soil properties and terrain attributes. On 27 plots in a subtropical Chinese forest varying in tree and herb layer species richness and tree productivity, 29 soil properties in six depth columns and four terrain attributes were analyzed. Soil properties varied with soil depth as did their interrelationships. Non-linearity of soil properties led to critical soil depths in which different P&CA characteristics were explained best (using coefficients of determination). The strongest relationship of soil properties and terrain attributes to most of P&CA characteristics (adj. R2 ~ 0.7) was encountered using a soil column of 0-16 cm. Thus, depending on the biological signal one is interested in, soil depth sampling has to be adapted. Considering P&CA in subtropical broad-leaved secondary forests, we recommend sampling one bulk sample of a column from 0 cm down to a critical soil depth of 16 cm.",Low connectivity compromises the conservation of reef fishes by marine protected areas in the tropical South Atlantic.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201350,Scientific reports,2019 06 15,"The total spatial coverage of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) within the Brazilian Economic Exclusive Zone (EEZ) has recently achieved the quantitative requirement of the Aichii Biodiversity Target 11. However, the distribution of MPAs in the Brazilian EEZ is still unbalanced regarding the proportion of protected ecosystems, protection goals and management types. Moreover, the demographic connectivity between these MPAs and their effectiveness regarding the maintenance of biodiversity are still not comprehensively understood. An individual-based modeling scheme coupled with a regional hydrodynamic model of the ocean is used to determine the demographic connectivity of reef fishes based on the widespread genus Sparisoma found in the oceanic islands and on the Brazilian continental shelf between 10° N and 23° S. Model results indicate that MPAs are highly isolated due to extremely low demographic connectivity. Consequently, low connectivity and the long distances separating MPAs contribute to their isolation. Therefore, the current MPA design falls short of its goal of maintaining the demographic connectivity of Sparisoma populations living within these areas. In an extreme scenario in which the MPAs rely solely on protected populations for recruits, it is unlikely that they will be able to effectively contribute to the resilience of these populations or other reef fish species sharing the same dispersal abilities. Results also show that recruitment occurs elsewhere along the continental shelf indicating that the protection of areas larger than the current MPAs would enhance the network, maintain connectivity and contribute to the conservation of reef fishes.",miR-29c overexpression and COL4A1 downregulation in infertile human endometrium reduces endometrial epithelial cell adhesive capacity in vitro implying roles in receptivity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201347,Scientific reports,2019 06 15,"The endometrium is a highly complex tissue that is vulnerable to subtle gene expression changes and is the first point of contact for an implanting blastocyst. Successful blastocyst implantation can only occur when the endometrium is receptive during a short window with each menstrual cycle. microRNAs are small, non-coding RNAs that negatively regulate their gene targets. miR-29c has previously been identified to be differentially regulated across the fertile menstrual cycle, however it has not been investigated in association with infertility. We hypothesised that miR-29c dysregulation in the infertile endometrium would negatively influence endometrial adhesion and blastocyst implantation outcomes during the mid-secretory, receptive phase. miR-29c expression was elevated in early and mid-secretory phase infertile endometrium and localised to the epithelial compartments of endometrial tissue. Overexpression of miR-29c in vitro impaired endometrial epithelial adhesion, and reduced collagen type IV alpha 1 (COL4A1) mRNA expression. COL4A1 was immunolocalised to the luminal and glandular epithelial basement membranes in early and mid-secretory phase fertile and infertile endometrium for the first time. Knockdown of COL4A1 impaired endometrial epithelial adhesion suggesting a role in endometrial receptivity and implantation. Our data suggests miR-29c overexpression with infertility may impair the adhesive capacity of the endometrium, potentially contributing to implantation failure and infertility.",High-throughput sequencing of IgG B-cell receptors reveals frequent usage of the rearranged IGHV4-28/IGHJ4 gene in primary immune thrombocytopenia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201346,Scientific reports,2019 06 15,"Primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an acquired form of thrombocytopenia caused by IgG anti-platelet autoantibodies and represents an organ-specific autoimmune disorder. Although the glycoprotein (GP)IIb/IIIa and GPIb/IX have been shown to be targets for autoantibodies, the antigen specificity of autoantibodies is not fully elucidated. To identify the characteristics of IgG B-cell receptor (BCR) repertoires in ITP, we took advantage of adaptor-ligation PCR and high-throughput DNA sequencing methods for analyzing the clone-based repertoires of IgG-expressing peripheral blood B cells. A total of 2,009,943 in-frame and 315,469 unique reads for IGH (immunoglobulin heavy) were obtained from twenty blood samples. Comparison of the IGHV repertoires between patients and controls revealed an increased usage of IGHV4-28 in ITP patients. One hundred eighty-six distinct IGHV4-28-carrying sequences were identified in ITP patients and the majority of these clones used an IGHJ4 segment. The IGHV4-28/IGHJ4-carrying B-cell clones were found in all ITP patients. Oligoclonal expansions of IGHV4-28/IGHJ4-carrying B cells were accompanied by multiple related clones with single amino substitution in the CDR3 region suggesting somatic hypermutation. Taken together, the expansion of IGHV4-28/IGHJ4-carrying IgG-expressing B cells in ITP may be the result of certain antigenic pressure and may provide a clue for the immune pathophysiology of ITP.",Membrane phospholipid alteration causes chronic ER stress through early degradation of homeostatic ER-resident proteins.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201345,Scientific reports,2019 06 15,"Phospholipid homeostasis in biological membranes is essential to maintain functions of organelles such as the endoplasmic reticulum. Phospholipid perturbation has been associated to cellular stress responses. However, in most cases, the implication of membrane lipid changes to homeostatic cellular response has not been clearly defined. Previously, we reported that Saccharomyces cerevisiae adapts to lipid bilayer stress by upregulating several protein quality control pathways such as the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway and the unfolded protein response (UPR). Surprisingly, we observed certain ER-resident transmembrane proteins, which form part of the UPR programme, to be destabilised under lipid bilayer stress. Among these, the protein translocon subunit Sbh1 was prematurely degraded by membrane stiffening at the ER. Moreover, our findings suggest that the Doa10 complex recognises free Sbh1 that becomes increasingly accessible during lipid bilayer stress, perhaps due to the change in ER membrane properties. Premature removal of key ER-resident transmembrane proteins might be an underlying cause of chronic ER stress as a result of lipid bilayer stress.","Association between radiation, glaucoma subtype, and retinal vessel diameter in atomic bomb survivors.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201344,Scientific reports,2019 06 15,"We examined the relationship between glaucoma subtype and retinal vascular caliber as markers of ocular circulation. Subjects were Japanese atomic bomb survivors in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. After a screening examination, potential cases were subjected to further definitive examination. The diameters of central retinal artery and vein equivalents (CRAE and CRVE) on digitized retinal photographs were measured using an established method. Generalized linear regression analyses were used to examine the associations among vessel diameters, radiation exposure, and prevalence of glaucoma subtypes among the study subjects. We identified 196 cases of glaucoma (12%) based on optic disc appearance, perimetry results, and other ocular findings. The main subtypes were primary angle-closure glaucoma, primary open-angle glaucoma and normal-tension glaucoma (NTG). NTG was the dominant subtype (78%). NTG was negatively associated with CRAE and CRVE, and positively associated with radiation dose. CRVE was negatively associated with radiation dose and the association was unclear for CRAE. The smaller retinal vessel caliber in NTG patients than in subjects without glaucoma may indicate an association between ocular blood flow and the pathogenesis of NTG. However, significant relationships among vessel calibers, NTG and radiation exposure were not clear.",Zebrafish macroH2A variants have distinct embryo localization and function.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201343,Scientific reports,2019 06 15,"Mouse and cell-based studies have shown that macroH2A histone variants predominantly associate with heterochromatin. Functional studies found that macroH2As are involved in gene repression, inhibiting the acquisition of pluripotency and preserving cell differentiation. However, only a few studies have analysed the role of macroH2A during early embryo development. We report the development of transgenic zebrafish lines expressing macroH2A isoforms (mH2A1 and mH2A2) fusion proteins (with GFP) under identified endogenous promoters. We found that mH2A1 and mH2A2 have different spatial and temporal expression patterns during embryonic development. mH2A1 is expressed mostly in the extraembryonic Yolk Syncytial Layer (YSL) starting before shield stage and decreasing once morphogenesis is completed. mH2A2 expression lags behind mH2A1, becoming evident at 24 hpf, within the whole body of the embryo proper. Our ChIP-seq analysis showed that mH2A1 and mH2A2 bind to different DNA regions, changing dramatically after gastrulation. We further analysed RNA-seq data and showed that there is not a general/unspecific repressing function of mH2A1 or mH2A2 associated with heterochromatin but a fine regulation depending on cell types and stage of development. mH2A1 downregulates DNA expression in specific cells and embryo stages and its effect is independent of heterochromatin formation but it is correlated with nucleus quiescence instead. Whereas mH2A2 DNA association correlates with upregulation of differentially expressed genes between 75% epiboly and 24 hpf stages. Our data provide information for underlying molecules that participate in crucial early developmental events, and open new venues to explore mH2A related mechanisms that involve cell proliferation, differentiation, migration and metabolism.",Strengthen of magnetic anisotropy of Au/Co/Au nanostructure by surface plasmon resonance.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201342,Scientific reports,2019 06 15,"We experimentally demonstrated the increase of in-plane magnetic anisotropy in Au/Co/Au nanostructures by localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR). When an array of Au/Co/Au square patch nanostructures was illuminated with linearly polarized light whose wavelength was 750 nm, the localized surface plasmons were resonantly excited in the nanostructures. From the measurement results of polar magneto-optical Kerr effect curves, we observed the magnetic anisotropy field increase in the Au/Co/Au nanostructure due to the excited surface plasmons. The in-plane magnetic anisotropy energy density was increased about 24%.",K+ and Cl- channels/transporters independently fine-tune photosynthesis in plants.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201341,Scientific reports,2019 06 15,"In variable light environments, plants adjust light use in photosynthetic electron transport and photoprotective dissipation in the thylakoid membrane. In this respect, roles of the K+/H+ antiporter KEA3, the Cl- channel/transporter CLCe and the voltage-dependent Cl- channel VCCN1 have been unraveled in Arabidopsis thaliana. Here we report that they independently adjust photosynthesis on the basis of analyses using single and higher order loss-of-function mutants. In short experiments of photosynthetic response on transition from dark to low light, we reveal a sequential functioning of VCCN1 and CLCe in the activation of photoprotection and of KEA3 in its downregulation to a low steady state while adjusting the electron transport. On transition from low to high light, VCCN1 accelerates the activation of photoprotection, whereas KEA3 slows it down on transition from high to low light. Based on parallel electrochromic band shift measurements, the mechanism behind is that VCCN1 builds up a pH gradient across the thylakoid membrane, whereas KEA3 dissipates this gradient, which affects photoprotection. CLCe regulates photosynthesis by a pH-independent mechanism likely involving Cl- homeostasis. Nevertheless, all genotypes grow well in alternating high and low light. Taken together, the three studied ion channels/transporters function independently in adjusting photosynthesis to the light environment.",Comparison of two accelerated 4D-flow sequences for aortic flow quantification.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201339,Scientific reports,2019 06 15,"To compare two broadly used 4D-flow- with a 2D-flow-sequence in healthy volunteers, regarding absolute flow parameters, image quality (IQ), and eddy current correction (ECC). Forty volunteers (42 ± 11.8 years, 22 females) were examined with a 3T scanner. Thoracic aortic flow was assessed using a 3D-T2w-SPACE-STIR-sequence for morphology and two accelerated 4D-flow sequences for comparison, one with k-t undersampling and one with standard GRAPPA parallel-imaging. 2D-flow was used as reference standard. The custom-made software tool Bloodline enabled flow measurements for all analyses at the same location. Quantitative flow analyses were performed with and without ECC. One reader assessed pathline IQ (IQ-PATH) and occurrence of motion artefacts (IQ-ART) on a 3-point grading scale, the higher the better. k-t GRAPPA allowed a significant mean scan time reduction of 46% (17:56 ± 5:26 min vs. 10:40 ± 3:15 min) and provided significantly fewer motion artefacts than standard GRAPPA (IQ-ART 1.57 ± 0.55 vs. 0.84 ± 0.48; p < 0.001). Neither 4D-flow sequence significantly differed in flow volume nor peak velocity results with or without ECC. Nevertheless, the correlation between both 4D-flow sequences and 2D-flow was better with ECC; the k-t GRAPPA sequence performed best (R = 0.96 vs. 0.90). k-t GRAPPA 4D-flow was not inferior to a standard GRAPPA-sequence, showed fewer artefacts, comparable IQ and was almost two-fold faster."

However, the intrinsic optical properties of monolayer boron nitride remain largely unexplored. In particular, the theoretically expected crossover to a direct-gap in the limit of the single monolayer is presently not confirmed experimentally. Here, in contrast to the technique of exfoliating few-layer 2D hexagonal boron nitride, we exploit the scalable approach of high-temperature molecular beam epitaxy to grow high-quality monolayer boron nitride on graphite substrates. We combine deep-ultraviolet photoluminescence and reflectance spectroscopy with atomic force microscopy to reveal the presence of a direct gap of energy 6.1 eV in the single atomic layers, thus confirming a crossover to direct gap in the monolayer limit.",Chromoselective access to Z- or E- allylated amines and heterocycles by a photocatalytic allylation reaction.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201327,Nature communications,2019 06 15,"The most useful strategies for the alkylation of allylic systems are related to the Tsuji-Trost reaction or the use of different Lewis acids. Herein we report a photocatalytic approach for the allylation reaction of a variety of nucleophiles, such as heteroarenes, amines and alcohols. This method is compatible with a large variety of pyrroles and indoles, containing different substituents such as electron-withdrawing and electron-donating groups, unprotected nitrogen atoms and bromo derivatives. Moreover, this methodology enables the chromoselective synthesis of Z- or E-allylated compounds. While the use of UV-light irradiation has allowed the synthesis of the previously inaccessible Z-allylated products, E-isomers are prepared simply by changing both the light source to the visible region, and the catalytic system. Based on mechanistic and photochemical proofs, laser flash photolysis studies and DFT calculations, a rational mechanism is presented.",Regulation of forward and backward locomotion through intersegmental feedback circuits in Drosophila larvae.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201326,Nature communications,2019 06 15,"Animal locomotion requires spatiotemporally coordinated contraction of muscles throughout the body. Here, we investigate how contractions of antagonistic groups of muscles are intersegmentally coordinated during bidirectional crawling of Drosophila larvae. We identify two pairs of higher-order premotor excitatory interneurons present in each abdominal neuromere that intersegmentally provide feedback to the adjacent neuromere during motor propagation. The two feedback neuron pairs are differentially active during either forward or backward locomotion but commonly target a group of premotor interneurons that together provide excitatory inputs to transverse muscles and inhibitory inputs to the antagonistic longitudinal muscles. Inhibition of either feedback neuron pair compromises contraction of transverse muscles in a direction-specific manner. Our results suggest that the intersegmental feedback neurons coordinate contraction of synergistic muscles by acting as delay circuits representing the phase lag between segments. The identified circuit architecture also shows how bidirectional motor networks could be economically embedded in the nervous system.",The pore structure of Clostridium perfringens epsilon toxin.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201325,Nature communications,2019 06 15,"Epsilon toxin (Etx), a potent pore forming toxin (PFT) produced by Clostridium perfringens, is responsible for the pathogenesis of enterotoxaemia of ruminants and has been suggested to play a role in multiple sclerosis in humans. Etx is a member of the aerolysin family of β-PFTs (aβ-PFTs). While the Etx soluble monomer structure was solved in 2004, Etx pore structure has remained elusive due to the difficulty of isolating the pore complex. Here we show the cryo-electron microscopy structure of Etx pore assembled on the membrane of susceptible cells. The pore structure explains important mutant phenotypes and suggests that the double β-barrel, a common feature of the aβ-PFTs, may be an important structural element in driving efficient pore formation. These insights provide the framework for the development of novel therapeutics to prevent human and animal infections, and are relevant for nano-biotechnology applications.",Voltage-dependent gating of SV channel TPC1 confers vacuole excitability.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201323,Nature communications,2019 06 15,"In contrast to the plasma membrane, the vacuole membrane has not yet been associated with electrical excitation of plants. Here, we show that mesophyll vacuoles from Arabidopsis sense and control the membrane potential essentially via the K+-permeable TPC1 and TPK channels. Electrical stimuli elicit transient depolarization of the vacuole membrane that can last for seconds. Electrical excitability is suppressed by increased vacuolar Ca2+ levels. In comparison to wild type, vacuoles from the fou2 mutant, harboring TPC1 channels insensitive to luminal Ca2+, can be excited fully by even weak electrical stimuli. The TPC1-loss-of-function mutant tpc1-2 does not respond to electrical stimulation at all, and the loss of TPK1/TPK3-mediated K+ transport affects the duration of TPC1-dependent membrane depolarization. In combination with mathematical modeling, these results show that the vacuolar K+-conducting TPC1 and TPK1/TPK3 channels act in concert to provide for Ca2+- and voltage-induced electrical excitability to the central organelle of plant cells.",Structural balance emerges and explains performance in risky decision-making.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201322,Nature communications,2019 06 15,"Polarization affects many forms of social organization. A key issue focuses on which affective relationships are prone to change and how their change relates to performance. In this study, we analyze a financial institutional over a two-year period that employed 66 day traders, focusing on links between changes in affective relations and trading performance. Traders' affective relations were inferred from their IMs (>2 million messages) and trading performance was measured from profit and loss statements (>1 million trades). Here, we find that triads of relationships, the building blocks of larger social structures, have a propensity towards affective balance, but one unbalanced configuration resists change. Further, balance is positively related to performance. Traders with balanced networks have the ""hot hand"", showing streaks of high performance. Research implications focus on how changes in polarization relate to performance and polarized states can depolarize.",The hydrolase LpqI primes mycobacterial peptidoglycan recycling.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201321,Nature communications,2019 06 15,"Growth and division by most bacteria requires remodelling and cleavage of their cell wall. A byproduct of this process is the generation of free peptidoglycan (PG) fragments known as muropeptides, which are recycled in many model organisms. Bacteria and hosts can harness the unique nature of muropeptides as a signal for cell wall damage and infection, respectively. Despite this critical role for muropeptides, it has long been thought that pathogenic mycobacteria such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis do not recycle their PG. Herein we show that M. tuberculosis and Mycobacterium bovis BCG are able to recycle components of their PG. We demonstrate that the core mycobacterial gene lpqI, encodes an authentic NagZ β-N-acetylglucosaminidase and that it is essential for PG-derived amino sugar recycling via an unusual pathway. Together these data provide a critical first step in understanding how mycobacteria recycle their peptidoglycan.",Altered NMDAR signaling underlies autistic-like features in mouse models of CDKL5 deficiency disorder.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201320,Nature communications,2019 06 15,"CDKL5 deficiency disorder (CDD) is characterized by epilepsy, intellectual disability, and autistic features, and CDKL5-deficient mice exhibit a constellation of behavioral phenotypes reminiscent of the human disorder. We previously found that CDKL5 dysfunction in forebrain glutamatergic neurons results in deficits in learning and memory. However, the pathogenic origin of the autistic features of CDD remains unknown. Here, we find that selective loss of CDKL5 in GABAergic neurons leads to autistic-like phenotypes in mice accompanied by excessive glutamatergic transmission, hyperexcitability, and increased levels of postsynaptic NMDA receptors. Acute, low-dose inhibition of NMDAR signaling ameliorates autistic-like behaviors in GABAergic knockout mice, as well as a novel mouse model bearing a CDD-associated nonsense mutation, CDKL5 R59X, implicating the translational potential of this mechanism. Together, our findings suggest that enhanced NMDAR signaling and circuit hyperexcitability underlie autistic-like features in mouse models of CDD and provide a new therapeutic avenue to treat CDD-related symptoms.",Convergent allostery in ribonucleotide reductase.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201319,Nature communications,2019 06 15,"Ribonucleotide reductases (RNRs) use a conserved radical-based mechanism to catalyze the conversion of ribonucleotides to deoxyribonucleotides. Within the RNR family, class Ib RNRs are notable for being largely restricted to bacteria, including many pathogens, and for lacking an evolutionarily mobile ATP-cone domain that allosterically controls overall activity. In this study, we report the emergence of a distinct and unexpected mechanism of activity regulation in the sole RNR of the model organism Bacillus subtilis. Using a hypothesis-driven structural approach that combines the strengths of small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), crystallography, and cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), we describe the reversible interconversion of six unique structures, including a flexible active tetramer and two inhibited helical filaments. These structures reveal the conformational gymnastics necessary for RNR activity and the molecular basis for its control via an evolutionarily convergent form of allostery.",Domain-interface dynamics of CFTR revealed by stabilizing nanobodies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201318,Nature communications,2019 06 15,"The leading cause of cystic fibrosis (CF) is the deletion of phenylalanine 508 (F508del) in the first nucleotide-binding domain (NBD1) of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). The mutation affects the thermodynamic stability of the domain and the integrity of the interface between NBD1 and the transmembrane domain leading to its clearance by the quality control system. Here, we develop nanobodies targeting NBD1 of human CFTR and demonstrate their ability to stabilize both isolated NBD1 and full-length protein. Crystal structures of NBD1-nanobody complexes provide an atomic description of the epitopes and reveal the molecular basis for stabilization. Furthermore, our data uncover a conformation of CFTR, involving detachment of NBD1 from the transmembrane domain, which contrast with the compact assembly observed in cryo-EM structures. This unexpected interface rearrangement is likely to have major relevance for CF pathogenesis but also for the normal function of CFTR and other ABC proteins."

Implementing mitigation strategies requires a complete understanding of the effects of nutrient control practices, given spatial and temporal variations. Here we simulate the environmental impacts of reducing nutrient discharge from domestic wastewater in 173 countries during 1990-2050. We find that improvements in wastewater infrastructure achieve a large-scale decline in nutrient input to surface waters, but this is causing detrimental effects on the atmosphere and the broader environment. Population size and dietary protein intake have the most significant effects over all the impacts arising from reduction of wastewater nutrients. Wastewater-related impact hotspots are also shifting from Asia to Africa, suggesting a need for interventions in such countries, mostly with growing populations, rising dietary intake, rapid urbanisation, and inadequate sanitation.","Electrosynthesis of high-entropy metallic glass nanoparticles for designer, multi-functional electrocatalysis.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201304,Nature communications,2019 06 15,"Creative approaches to the design of catalytic nanomaterials are necessary in achieving environmentally sustainable energy sources. Integrating dissimilar metals into a single nanoparticle (NP) offers a unique avenue for customizing catalytic activity and maximizing surface area. Alloys containing five or more equimolar components with a disordered, amorphous microstructure, referred to as High-Entropy Metallic Glasses (HEMGs), provide tunable catalytic performance based on the individual properties of incorporated metals. Here, we present a generalized strategy to electrosynthesize HEMG-NPs with up to eight equimolar components by confining multiple metal salt precursors to water nanodroplets emulsified in dichloroethane. Upon collision with an electrode, alloy NPs are electrodeposited into a disordered microstructure, where dissimilar metal atoms are proximally arranged. We also demonstrate precise control over metal stoichiometry by tuning the concentration of metal salt dissolved in the nanodroplet. The application of HEMG-NPs to energy conversion is highlighted with electrocatalytic water splitting on CoFeLaNiPt HEMG-NPs.","Harnessing the HDAC-histone deacetylase enzymes, inhibitors and how these can be utilised in tissue engineering.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201303,International journal of oral science,2019 06 15,"There are large knowledge gaps regarding how to control stem cells growth and differentiation. The limitations of currently available technologies, such as growth factors and/or gene therapies has led to the search of alternatives. We explore here how a cell's epigenome influences determination of cell type, and potential applications in tissue engineering. A prevalent epigenetic modification is the acetylation of DNA core histone proteins. Acetylation levels heavily influence gene transcription. Histone deacetylase (HDAC) enzymes can remove these acetyl groups, leading to the formation of a condensed and more transcriptionally silenced chromatin. Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis) can inhibit these enzymes, resulting in the increased acetylation of histones, thereby affecting gene expression. There is strong evidence to suggest that HDACis can be utilised in stem cell therapies and tissue engineering, potentially providing novel tools to control stem cell fate. This review introduces the structure/function of HDAC enzymes and their links to different tissue types (specifically bone, cardiac, neural tissues), including the history, current status and future perspectives of using HDACis for stem cell research and tissue engineering, with particular attention paid to how different HDAC isoforms may be integral to this field.",In situ structure and assembly of the multidrug efflux pump AcrAB-TolC.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201302,Nature communications,2019 06 15,"Multidrug efflux pumps actively expel a wide range of toxic substrates from the cell and play a major role in intrinsic and acquired drug resistance. In Gram-negative bacteria, these pumps form tripartite assemblies that span the cell envelope. However, the in situ structure and assembly mechanism of multidrug efflux pumps remain unknown. Here we report the in situ structure of the Escherichia coli AcrAB-TolC multidrug efflux pump obtained by electron cryo-tomography and subtomogram averaging. The fully assembled efflux pump is observed in a closed state under conditions of antibiotic challenge and in an open state in the presence of AcrB inhibitor. We also observe intermediate AcrAB complexes without TolC and discover that AcrA contacts the peptidoglycan layer of the periplasm. Our data point to a sequential assembly process in living bacteria, beginning with formation of the AcrAB subcomplex and suggest domains to target with efflux pump inhibitors.",XX sex chromosome complement promotes atherosclerosis in mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201301,Nature communications,2019 06 15,"Men and women differ in circulating lipids and coronary artery disease (CAD). While sex hormones such as estrogens decrease CAD risk, hormone replacement therapy increases risk. Biological sex is determined by sex hormones and chromosomes, but effects of sex chromosomes on circulating lipids and atherosclerosis are unknown. Here, we use mouse models to separate effects of sex chromosomes and hormones on atherosclerosis, circulating lipids and intestinal fat metabolism. We assess atherosclerosis in multiple models and experimental paradigms that distinguish effects of sex chromosomes, and male or female gonads. Pro-atherogenic lipids and atherosclerosis are greater in XX than XY mice, indicating a primary effect of sex chromosomes. Small intestine expression of enzymes involved in lipid absorption and chylomicron assembly are greater in XX male and female mice with higher intestinal lipids. Together, our results show that an XX sex chromosome complement promotes the bioavailability of dietary fat to accelerate atherosclerosis.",Superconductivity from the condensation of topological defects in a quantum spin-Hall insulator.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201300,Nature communications,2019 06 15,"The discovery of quantum spin-Hall (QSH) insulators has brought topology to the forefront of condensed matter physics. While a QSH state from spin-orbit coupling can be fully understood in terms of band theory, fascinating many-body effects are expected if it instead results from spontaneous symmetry breaking. Here, we introduce a model of interacting Dirac fermions where a QSH state is dynamically generated. Our tuning parameter further allows us to destabilize the QSH state in favour of a superconducting state through proliferation of charge-2e topological defects. This route to superconductivity put forward by Grover and Senthil is an instance of a deconfined quantum critical point (DQCP). Our model offers the possibility to study DQCPs without a second length scale associated with the reduced symmetry between field theory and lattice realization and, by construction, is amenable to large-scale fermion quantum Monte Carlo simulations.",Non-proteolytic ubiquitination of Hexokinase 2 by HectH9 controls tumor metabolism and cancer stem cell expansion.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201299,Nature communications,2019 06 15,"Enormous efforts have been made to target metabolic dependencies of cancer cells for developing new therapies. However, the therapeutic efficacy of glycolysis inhibitors is limited due to their inability to elicit cell death. Hexokinase 2 (HK2), via its mitochondrial localization, functions as a central nexus integrating glycolysis activation and apoptosis resilience. Here we identify that K63-linked ubiquitination by HectH9 regulates the mitochondrial localization and function of HK2. Through stable isotope tracer approach and functional metabolic analyses, we show that HectH9 deficiency impedes tumor glucose metabolism and growth by HK2 inhibition. The HectH9/HK2 pathway regulates cancer stem cell (CSC) expansion and CSC-associated chemoresistance. Histological analyses show that HectH9 expression is upregulated and correlated with disease progression in prostate cancer. This work uncovers that HectH9 is a novel regulator of HK2 and cancer metabolism. Targeting HectH9 represents an effective strategy to achieve long-term tumor remission by concomitantly disrupting glycolysis and inducing apoptosis.",Fluid-Blood Level and Hematoma Expansion in a Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy-Associated Intracerebral Hematoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201298,The American journal of case reports,2019 06 15,"BACKGROUND Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) results from progressive deposition of amyloid-ß in the walls of cortical and leptomeningeal vessels, leading to CAA-associated intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Hematoma expansion is a common early complication of spontaneous ICH, and is a strong independent predictor of poor outcome. However, there are limited reports of hematoma expansion related to CAA-associated ICH. Herein, we describe a novel case of hematoma expansion with a fluid-blood level in the cystic cavity of CAA-associated ICH. CASE REPORT A 76-year-old male was initially diagnosed with probable CAA according to the modified Boston criteria, and presented with lobar ICH in the left frontal lobe 4 months later. Admission computed tomography scans showed an ICH including a high-density hematoma within a cystic cavity, revealing a clearly lower-density fluid component. Serial computed tomography scans showed no evidence of an expansion of the high-density clot, but obvious expansion of the fluid component containing a fluid-blood level. We recognized a bleeding site with no enhancement on preoperative magnetic resonance imaging. Left frontal craniotomy revealed a liquefied hematoma, which was removed by suction. We subsequently evacuated the blood clot extending into the left frontal sulcus, and confirmed and cauterized the bleeding site, leading to successful hemostasis. CONCLUSIONS We report a CAA-associated ICH case showing hematoma expansion with a fluid-blood level. Intraparenchymal fluid-blood level suggests extravasation of blood into pre-existing cystic cavities because of hematoma liquefaction. Thus, fluid-blood levels are an important finding of hematoma expansion in acute CAA-associated ICH, and early treatment should be considered.",Phospholipase C (PLC)ε Promotes Androgen Receptor Antagonist Resistance via the Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP)-6/SMAD Axis in a Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Cell Line.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201297,Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research,2019 06 15,"BACKGROUND Primary therapy for patients with advanced prostate cancer (PCa) consists of androgen deprivation therapy targeting the androgen receptor (AR) axis. However, most tumors progress to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) within 18-24 months. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the mechanisms through which PCa acquires drug resistance after long-term treatment with AR antagonists. MATERIAL AND METHODS Online database analysis and bioinformatics analysis were performed to identify signaling activated during anti-androgen treatment. MTT assay was used to detect cell viability. RT-qPCR was performed to examine the mRNA expression of the indicated genes. Colony formation assay was performed to observe cell proliferation. Transwell assay was conducted to demonstrate invasive ability. Protein levels were determined by Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence assays. RESULTS An online database search and bioinformatics analysis indicated that bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-6/SMAD signaling was activated in enzalutamide-resistant LNCaP cells. Furthermore, this signaling interaction was experimentally verified in bicalutamide- and enzalutamide-resistant LNCaP cells, which may be regulated by phospholipase C (PLC)ε and induced cell proliferation and invasion. Of note, a positive correlation was observed between PLCε and BMP-6 in CRPC tissue samples, which may promote bone metastasis and suggests a poor prognosis. CONCLUSIONS The present results suggest that targeting of PLCε/BMP-6/SMAD signaling may increase the sensitivity of CRPC to AR antagonists and inhibit tumor progression."

Pharmacological inhibition of mitochondrial function or NCKX exchanger activity reduced pigment production. Loss of NCKX5 attenuated Ca2+ enrichment in melanosomes which compromised PMEL fibril formation, melanosome maturation and pigment production.

Here we demonstrate that mouse pancreas size and islet β cell function are controlled by the ATP-dependent Swi/Snf chromatin remodeling coregulatory complex that physically associates with Pdx1, a diabetes-linked transcription factor essential to pancreatic morphogenesis and adult islet-cell function and maintenance. Early embryonic deletion of just the Swi/Snf Brg1 ATPase subunit reduced multipotent pancreatic progenitor cell proliferation and resulted in pancreas hypoplasia. In contrast, removal of both Swi/Snf ATPase subunits, Brg1 and Brm, was necessary to compromise adult islet β cell activity, which included whole animal glucose intolerance, hyperglycemia and impaired insulin secretion. Notably, lineage-tracing analysis revealed Swi/Snf-deficient β cells lost the ability to produce the mRNAs for insulin and other key metabolic genes without effecting the expression of many essential islet-enriched transcription factors. Swi/Snf was necessary for Pdx1 to bind to the insulin gene enhancer, demonstrating the importance of this association in mediating chromatin accessibility. These results illustrate how fundamental the Pdx1:Swi/Snf coregulator complex is in the pancreas and we discuss how disrupting their association could influence Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes susceptibility.",Intra-Islet Ghrelin Signaling does not Regulate Insulin Secretion from Adult Mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201280,Diabetes,2019 06 15,"Exogenous ghrelin reduces glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and endogenous ghrelin protects against hypoglycemia during starvation.

Currently, sacB-based vector systems are often used for allelic exchange, but counter-selection escape, which prevents isolation of cells with the desired mutation, occasionally limits their utility. To circumvent this, we engineered a series of ""pTOX"" allelic exchange vectors. Each plasmid encodes one of a set of inducible toxins, chosen for their potential utility in a wide range of medically important Proteobacteria. A codon-optimized rhaS transcriptional activator with a strong synthetic ribosome binding site enables tight toxin induction even in organisms lacking an endogenous rhamnose regulon. Expression of the blue amilCP or magenta tsPurple non-fluorescent chromoproteins facilitates monitoring of successful single- and double-crossover events using these vectors. The versatility of these vectors was demonstrated by deleting genes in Serratia marcescens, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Enterobacter cloacae, and Shigella flexneri Finally, pTOX was used to characterize the impact of disruption of all combinations of the 3 paralogous S. marcescens peptidoglycan amidohydrolases on chromosomal ampC β-lactamase activity and corresponding β-lactam antibiotic resistance. Mutation of multiple amidohydrolases was necessary for high level ampC derepression and β-lactam resistance. These data suggest why β-lactam resistance may emerge during treatment less frequently in S. marcescens than in other AmpC-producing pathogens like E. cloacae. Collectively, our findings suggest that the pTOX vectors should be broadly useful for genetic engineering of Gram-negative bacteria.Importance Targeted modification of bacterial genomes is critical for genetic analyses of microorganisms. Allelic exchange is a technique that relies on homologous recombination to substitute native loci with engineered sequences. However, current allelic exchange vectors often enable only weak selection for successful homologous recombination. We developed a suite of new allelic exchange vectors, pTOX, which were validated in several medically important Proteobacteria. They encode visible non-fluorescent chromoproteins that enable easy identification of colonies bearing integrated vector, and permit stringent selection for the second step of homologous recombination. We demonstrate the utility of these vectors by using them to investigate the effect of inactivation of Serratia marcescens peptidoglycan amidohydrolases on β-lactam antibiotic resistance.",An in vitro enrichment strategy for formulating synergistic synbiotics.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201276,Applied and environmental microbiology,2019 06 15,"Research on the role of diet on gut and systemic health has led to considerable interest in identifying novel therapeutic modulators of the gut microbiome, including the use of prebiotics and probiotics. However, varying host responses have often been reported among many clinical trials. This is in part due to competitive exclusion as a result of the absence of ecological niches, as well as host-mediated constraints via colonization resistance. In this research, we developed a novel in vitro enrichment (IVE) method for isolating autochthonous strains that can function as synergistic synbiotics and overcome these constraints. The method relied on step-wise in vitro fecal fermentations to enrich for and isolate Bifidobacterium strains that ferment the prebiotic, xylooligosaccharide (XOS). We subsequently isolated Bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum CR15 and then tested its establishment in 20 unique fecal samples with or without XOS. The strain was established in up to 18 samples, but only in the presence of XOS. Our findings revealed that the IVE method is suitable for isolating potential synergistic probiotic strains that possess the genetic and biochemical ability to ferment specific prebiotic substrates. The IVE method can be used as an initial high throughput screen for probiotic selection and isolation prior to further characterization and in vivo tests.IMPORTANCEThis study describes an in vitro enrichment method to formulate synergistic synbiotics that have potential for establishing autochthonous strains across multiple individuals. The rationale for this approach - that the chance of survival of a bacteria strain is improved by providing it with its required resources, is based on classic ecological theory. From these experiments, a human-derived strain, Bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum CR15 was identified as a XOS fermenter in fecal environments and displayed synergistic effects in vitro The high rate of strain establishment observed in this study provides a basis for using synergistic synbiotics to overcome the responder/non-responder phenomenon that occurs frequently in clinical trials with probiotic and prebiotic interventions. In addition, this approach can be applied in other protocols that require enrichment of specific bacteria populations prior to strain isolation.",The female reproductive tract contains multiple innate sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectins (Siglecs) that facilitate sperm survival.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201275,The Journal of biological chemistry,2019 06 15,"A sperm that fertilizes an egg has successfully survived multiple checkpoints within the female reproductive tract, termed pre-fertilization events. The leukocytic response is a pre-fertilization event in which sperm trigger an immune response that promotes homing of circulating leukocytes to the uterine lumen to destroy most sperm. Various glycoconjugates decorate the sperm surface, including sialic acids, which are abundant at the sperm surface where they cap most glycan chains and regulate sperm migration through cervical mucus, formation of the sperm oviductal reservoir, and sperm capacitation. However, the role of sperm-associated sialic acids in the leukocytic reaction remains unknown. The cognate endogenous binding partners of sialic acids, sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectins (Siglecs) play a pivotal role in regulating many immune responses. Here we investigated whether sperm-associated sialic acids inhibit activation of neutrophils, one of the major immune cells involved in the leukocytic reaction. We used in vitro interactions between sperm and neutrophils as well as binding assays between sperm and recombinant Siglec-Fc chimeric proteins to measure intearactions. Moreover, we examined whether Siglecs are expressed on human and mouse endometria, which have a role in initiating the leukocytic reaction. Surprisingly less sialylated, capacitated, sperm did not increase neutrophil activation in vitro. However, we observed expression of several Siglecs on the endometrium and that these receptors interact with sialylated sperm. Our results indicate that sperm sialic acids may interact with endometrial Siglecs and that these interactions facilitate sperm survival in the face of female immunity.",The neuropeptide GsMTx4 inhibits a mechanosensitive BK channel through the voltage-dependent modification specific to mechano-gating.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201274,The Journal of biological chemistry,2019 06 15,"The cardiac mechanosensitive BK (Slo1) channels are gated by Ca2+, voltage and membrane stretch. The neuropeptide GsMTx4 is a selective inhibitor of mechanosensitive (MS) channels. It has been reported to suppress stretch-induced cardiac fibrillation in the heart, but the mechanism underlying the specificity and even the targeting channel(s) in the heart remain elusive. Here we report that GsMTx4 inhibits a stretch-activated BK channel (SAKcaC) in heart through a modulation specific to mechano-gating. We show that membrane stretching increases, while GsMTx4 decreases the open probability (Po) of SAKcaC. These effects were mostly abolished by the deletion of the STREX-axis-regulated (STREX) exon located between RCK1 and RCK2 domains in BK channels. Single channel kinetics analysis revealed that membrane stretch activates SAKcaC by prolonging the open-time duration (τO) and shortening the closed-time constant (τC). In contrast, GsMTx4 reversed the effects of membrane stretch, suggesting that GsMTx4 inhibits SAKcaC activity by interfering with mechano-gating of the channel. Moreover, GsMTx4 exerted stronger efficacy on SAKcaC under membrane hyperpolarized/resting conditions. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation study revealed that GsMTx4 appeared to have the ability to penetrate to be located deeply within the bilayer, thus generates strong membrane deformation under the hyperpolarized / resting conditions. Immunostaining results indicate that BK variants containing STREX are also expressed in mouse ventricular cardiomyocyte. Our results provide common mechanisms of peptides action on MS channels and may give clues to therapeutic suppression of cardiac arrhythmias caused by excitatory currents through MS channels under hyper-mechanical stress in the heart.",Solution structure and functional investigation of human guanylate kinase reveals allosteric networking and a crucial role for the enzyme in cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201273,The Journal of biological chemistry,2019 06 15,"Human guanylate kinase (hGMPK) is the only known enzyme responsible for cellular GDP production, making it essential for cellular viability and proliferation. Moreover, hGMPK has been assigned a critical role in metabolic activation of antiviral and antineoplastic nucleoside-analog pro-drugs. Given that hGMPK is indispensable for producing the nucleotide building blocks of DNA, RNA, and cGMP and that cancer cells possess elevated GTP levels, it is surprising that a detailed structural and functional characterization of hGMPK is lacking. Here, we present the first high-resolution structure of hGMPK in the apo form, determined with NMR spectroscopy. The structure revealed that hGMPK consists of three distinct regions designated as the LID, GMP-binding (GMP-BD), and CORE domains and is in an open configuration that is nucleotide-binding competent. We also demonstrate that nonsynonymous single-nucleotide variants (nsSNVs) of the hGMPK CORE domain distant from the nucleotide-binding site of this domain modulate enzymatic activity without significantly affecting hGMPK's structure. Finally, we show that knocking down the hGMPK gene in lung adenocarcinoma cell lines decreases cellular viability, proliferation, and clonogenic potential while not altering the proliferation of immortalized, non-cancerous human peripheral airway cells. Taken together, our results provide an important step toward establishing hGMPK as a potential biomolecular target, from both an orthosteric (ligand-binding sites) and allosteric (location of CORE domain-located nsSNVs) standpoint.",Increased sulfation of bile acids in mice and human subjects with sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide deficiency.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201272,The Journal of biological chemistry,2019 06 15,"Sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP, encoded by Slc10a1/SLC10A1) deficiency can result in hypercholanemia but no obvious symptoms in both mice and human. However, the consequence of and the response to long-term hypercholanemia caused by NTCP deficiency largely remain unexplored. Here, we analyzed lifelong dynamics of serum total bile acids (TBA) levels in Slc10a1-/- mice, and we also assessed changes of TBA levels in thirty-three young individuals with SLC10A1 loss-of-function variant p.Ser267Phe. We found that overall serum TBA levels tended to decrease gradually with age in both Slc10a1-/-  mice and p.Ser267Phe individuals. Liver mRNA profiling revealed notable transcription alterations in hypercholanemic Slc10a1-/- mice, including inhibition of BA synthesis, enhancement of BA detoxification, and altered BA transport. Members of the sulfotransferase (SULT) family showed the most dramatic increases in livers of hypercholanemic Slc10a1-/- mice, and one of their BA sulfates, taurolithocholic acid 3-sulfate significantly increased. Importantly, in consistent with the mouse studies, comprehensive profiling of fifty-eight BA species in sera of p.Ser267Phe individuals revealed strikingly increased level of BA sulfates. Together our ﬁndings indicate that the enhanced BA sulfation is a major mechanism for BA detoxification and elimination in both mice and human with Slc10a1/SLC10A1 deficiency."

We have developed PARaDIM, a freeware application for implementing tetrahedral mesh-type phantoms in absorbed dose calculations via the Particle and Heavy Ion Transport code System (PHITS). It considers all medically relevant radionuclides including alpha, beta, gamma, positron, and Auger/conversion electron emitters, and handles calculation of mean dose to individual regions, as well as 3D dose distributions for visualization and analysis in a variety of medical imaging softwares. This work describes the development of PARaDIM, documents the measures taken to test and validate its performance, and presents examples to illustrate its uses. Methods: Human, small animal, and cell-level dose calculations were performed with PARaDIM and the results compared with those of widely accepted dosimetry programs and literature data. Several tetrahedral phantoms were developed or adapted using computer-aided modeling techniques for these comparisons. Results: For human dose calculations, agreement of PARaDIM with OLINDA 2.0 was good - within 10-20% for most organs - despite geometric differences among the phantoms tested. Agreement with MIRDcell for cell-level S-value calculations was within 5% in most cases. Conclusion: PARaDIM extends the use of Monte Carlo dose calculations to the broader community in nuclear medicine by providing a user-friendly graphical user interface for calculation setup and execution. PARaDIM leverages the enhanced anatomical realism provided by advanced computational reference phantoms or bespoke image-derived phantoms to enable improved assessments of radiation doses in a variety of radiopharmaceutical use cases, research, and preclinical development.",Copper-64 PET imaging of the CXCR4 chemokine receptor using a cross-bridged cyclam bis-tetraazamacrocyclic antagonist.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201250,"Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",2019 06 15,"Expression of the chemokine receptor chemokine C-X-C motif receptor 4 (CXCR4) plays an important role in cancer metastasis, autoimmune diseases and during stem cell based repair processes after stroke and myocardial infarction.

Methods: From the LNH073B trial (NCT00498043), patients with an advanced stage DLCBL and 18F-FDG PET/CT images available for review were selected. MTV and several RF, including the distance between the two lesions that were the furthest apart (Dmaxpatient) were calculated. Receiver operator characteristics analysis were used to determine the optimal cut-off for quantitative variables and Kaplan-Meier survival analyses were performed. Results: With a median age of 46 years, 95 patients were enrolled, half of them treated with R-CHOP14 (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone), the others with R-ACVBP (rituximab, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vindesine, bleomycin, prednisone), with no significant impact on outcome. Median MTV and Dmaxpatient were 375 cm3 and 45 cm respectively. The median follow-up was 44 months. High MTV and Dmaxpatient were adverse factors for PFS (P = 0.027 and P = 0.0003 respectively) and for OS (P = 0.0007, P = 0.0095). In multivariate analysis, only Dmaxpatient was significantly associated with PFS (P = 0.0014) whereas both factors remained significant for OS (P = 0.037 and P = 0.0029 respectively). Combining MTV (>384 cm3) and Dmaxpatient (>58 cm) yielded 3 risk groups for PFS (P = 0.0003) and OS (P = 0.0011): high with 2 adverse factors (4y-PFS and OS of 50% and 53%, n = 18), low risk with no adverse factor (94% and 97%, n = 36), and an intermediate category with one adverse factor (73% and 88%, n = 41).

Increasing evidence reveals that smoking-related cancers have distinct molecular characteristics from non-smoking cancers. By now, the role of ATM rs189037 in cancer risk stratified by smoking status still remains unclear. To evaluate the association between ATM rs189037 and cancer risk based on smoking status, we performed this meta-analysis by a comprehensive literature search via databases of PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and CNKI, updated to January 2019. Multivariate-adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were extracted from eligible studies if available, to assess the relationship strengths. A total of seven eligible studies were included, comprising 4294 cancer patients (smokers: 1744 [40.6%]) and 4259 controls (smokers: 1418 [33.3%]). Results indicated a significant association of ATM rs189037 with cancer risk. In non-smokers, compared with GG genotype, AA genotype increased a 1.40-fold risk of overall cancer (OR = 1.40, 95%CI = 1.15-1.70, Pheterogeneity = 0.433, I2 = 0.0%).

There is growing interest in understanding how microglia influence normal brain function and disease progression. Several microglia-specific Cx3cr1-Cre lines have been developed and have become indispensable tools in many investigations of microglial function. However, some recent studies have reported that these lines may have significant leakage into neurons. Other studies have reported that Cx3cr1 is expressed in non-microglial cells, including neurons and astrocytes, in vitro or in vivo either during brain development or upon neurological insult. All these reports raise serious concerns about the trustworthiness of these Cre-lines and whether the conclusions drawn from previous studies are valid. Here, we found that a floxed fluorescent reporter mouse line which has been frequently used to verify Cre lines displayed spontaneous expression of the GFP reporter, independent of Cre recombinase, thus revealing a potential caveat in assessing cre lines. We further confirmed that two Cx3cr1-Cre mouse lines can drive fluorescent reporter expression largely restrictively in microglia. Finally, we clarified that these two mouse lines maintain microglia-specific expression even following excitatory injury. Together, our findings confirm that two previously created Cx3cr1-Cre lines remain as invaluable tools for studying microglia. Moreover, to ensure the quality of data generated and the soundness of conclusions drawn from such data, it should be compulsory to thoroughly examine reporter lines for spontaneous leakiness when labeling cells to study CNS function and diseases.Significance Statement Microglia-specific Cre-lines are essential for studying the role of microglia in the CNS. Several Cx3cr1-Cre lines have been developed and used in a number of landmark studies. However, there is growing concern in the microglia research community regarding potential leakiness of Cre-lines into neurons. The conclusions drawn from previous studies are also being questioned and key ongoing studies have been stalled. We found that a GFP-reporter mouse lines used in a previous study displays spontaneous leakiness into neurons, independent of Cre recombinase. Furthermore, we confirmed that two Cre-lines are microglia-specific and thus can be redeployed without hesitation. Our study also suggests that testing for potential leakiness of GFP-reporter lines should be included as a control in cell-tracing experiments.",PTPN3 acts as a tumor suppressor and boosts TGF-β signaling independent of its phosphatase activity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201214,The EMBO journal,2019 06 15,"TGF-β controls a variety of cellular functions during development. Abnormal TGF-β responses are commonly found in human diseases such as cancer, suggesting that TGF-β signaling must be tightly regulated. Here, we report that protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor 3 (PTPN3) profoundly potentiates TGF-β signaling independent of its phosphatase activity. PTPN3 stabilizes TGF-β type I receptor (TβRI) through attenuating the interaction between Smurf2 and TβRI Consequently, PTPN3 facilitates TGF-β-induced R-Smad phosphorylation, transcriptional responses, and subsequent physiological responses. Importantly, the leucine-to-arginine substitution at amino acid residue 232 (L232R) of PTPN3, a frequent mutation found in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC), disables its role in enhancing TGF-β signaling and abolishes its tumor-suppressive function. Our findings have revealed a vital role of PTPN3 in regulating TGF-β signaling during normal physiology and pathogenesis."

However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms involved, except that this action is mediated by DNA methylation and requires STAT3 acetylation. In this issue of Cancer Research, Gambi and colleagues confirm that oncogene-driven constitutive STAT3 acetylation is responsible for TSG silencing. Furthermore, they show that the Sin3a transcriptional repressor complex is an obligatory partner of STAT3 on the promoters of the repressed genes, shedding light on the mechanisms involved in STAT3-mediated transcriptional repression, and more importantly, identifying that the STAT3-Sin3a axis is a potential selective therapeutic target in STAT3-dependent tumors.See related article by Gambi et al., p. 3076.",Disruption of Long Noncoding RNAs Targets Cancer Hallmark Pathways in Lung Tumorigenesis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201165,Cancer research,2019 06 15,"Advances in high-throughput genomic and epigenomic technologies have revealed the tremendous complexity of the transcriptional landscape. Beyond protein-coding RNAs (derived from only ∼1.5% of the genome), noncoding RNAs (ncRNA) are emerging as versatile key regulators of gene information involved in multiple major biological processes. Accordingly, deregulation of ncRNA expression has been associated with multiple diseases, including cancer. In this issue of Cancer Research, Shahabi and colleagues characterize LINC00261 as a tumor suppressor long ncRNA epigenetically silenced in lung cancer. They provide crucial mechanistic insights to explain its role in lung tumorigenesis, demonstrating that deregulation of the LINC00261/FOXA2 locus disrupts DNA damage repair signaling, cell-cycle control, and cell proliferation.See related article by Shahabi et al., p. 3050.",The Y227N mutation affects bestrophin-1 protein stability and impairs sperm function in a mouse model of Best vitelliform macular dystrophy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201163,Biology open,2019 06 15,"Human bestrophin-1 (BEST1) is an integral membrane protein known to function as a Ca2+-activated and volume-regulated chloride channel. The majority of disease-associated mutations in BEST1 constitute missense mutations and were shown in-vitro to lead to a reduction in mutant protein half-life causing Best disease (BD), a rare autosomal dominant macular dystrophy. To further delineate BEST1-associated pathology in-vivo and to provide an animal model useful to explore experimental treatment efficacies, we have generated a knock-in mouse line (Best1Y227N). Heterozygous and homozygous mutants revealed no significant ocular abnormalities up to 2 years of age. In contrast, knock-in animals demonstrated a severe phenotype in the male reproductive tract. In heterozygous Best1Y227N males, Best1 protein was significantly reduced in testis and almost absent in homozygous mutant mice, although mRNA transcription of wildtype and knock-in allele is present and similar in quantity. Degradation of mutant Best1 protein in testis was associated with adverse effects on sperm motility and the capability to fertilize eggs. Based on these results, we conclude that mice carrying the Best1 Y227N mutation reveal a reproducible pathologic phenotype and thus provide a valuable in-vivo tool to evaluate efficacy of drug therapies aimed at restoring Best1 protein stability and function.",Predicting risk of underconfidence following maternity leave.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201159,Archives of disease in childhood,2019 06 15,To determine what factors affect paediatric trainee confidence on return to work after maternity leave.

Zika virus (ZIKV) and yellow fever virus (YFV) are flaviviruses that have caused significant outbreaks in the last few years. Since there is no approved vaccine against ZIKV, and since the existing YF attenuated vaccine presents disadvantages related to limited supply and to rare, but fatal adverse effects, there is an urgent need for new vaccines to control these diseases. Virus-like particles (VLPs) represent a recombinant platform to produce safe and immunogenic vaccines. Thus, based on our experience of expressing in recombinant mammalian cells VLPs of most flaviviruses circulating in the Americas, this work focused on the evaluation of chromatographic purification processes for zika and yellow-fever VLPs. The clarified cell culture supernatant was processed by a membrane-based anion-exchange chromatography and then a multimodal chromatographic step. With this process, it was possible to obtain the purified VLPs with a yield (including the clarification step) of 66.4% for zika and 68.1% for yellow fever. DNA clearance was in the range of 99.8-99.9%, providing VLP preparations that meet the WHO limit for this critical contaminant. Correct size and morphology of the purified VLPs were confirmed by dynamic light scattering (DLS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The promising results obtained for both zika and yellow fever VLPs indicate that this process could be potentially applied also to VLPs of other flaviviruses.","Comparing influenza vaccine effectiveness between cell-derived and egg-derived vaccines, 2017-2018 influenza season.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201055,Vaccine,2019 06 15,"The Department of Defense Global Respiratory Pathogen Surveillance Program conducted a study to compare the differences in vaccine effectiveness (VE) of the cell-derived and egg-derived vaccines. DoD healthcare beneficiaries, excluding service members, that presented with influenza-like illness for the period of 1 October 2017 through 28 April 2018 were included in a test-negative case-control study examining laboratory confirmed influenza infections. Three VE analyses were performed (1) influenza infection among those vaccinated with cell-derived vaccines (2) influenza infection among those vaccinated with egg-derived vaccines and a (3) relative VE which directly compared the odds of influenza infection with cell-derived vaccine against those with egg-derived vaccines. The cell-derived and egg-derived vaccines were moderately protective against all influenza types with significant VE estimates for all dependents at 46% (95% confidence interval, 33, 56) and 53% (45, 60), respectively. Of the subtype analyses, influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 performed the best. In the cell-derived vaccine, the adult age group was moderate to high at 71% (44, 85) and children moderate at 56% (15, 75). In the egg-derived vaccine, the children age group was at a high 88% (80, 93) effectiveness and adults at 81% (56, 92). When comparing cell-derived vaccine directly to the egg-derived vaccine, the relative VE found significant results only for influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 which favored the egg-derived vaccine with odds ratios of 2.0 (1.1, 3.6) for all dependents and 2.9 (1.3, 6.3) for children. In the influenza A(H3N2) analysis, statistical significance was not gained; however, the odds favored the cell-derived vaccine.",Adaptation of Vero cells to suspension growth for rabies virus production in different serum free media.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201054,Vaccine,2019 06 15,"Vero cells are nowadays widely used in the production of human vaccines. They are considered as one of the most productive and flexible continuous cell lines available for vaccine manufacturing. However, these cells are anchorage dependent, which greatly complicates upstream processing and process scale-up. Moreover, there is a recognized need to reduce the costs of vaccine manufacturing to develop vaccines that are affordable worldwide. The use of cell lines adapted to suspension growth contributes to reach this objective. The current work describes the adaptation of Vero cells to suspension culture in different serum free media according to multiple protocols based on subsequent passages. The best one that relies on cell adaption to IPT-AFM an in-house developed animal component free medium was then chosen for further studies. Besides, as aggregates have been observed, the improvement of IPT-AFM composition and mechanical dissociation were also investigated. In addition to IPT-AFM, three chemically defined media (CD293, Hycell CHO and CD-U5) and two serum free media (293SFMII and SFM4CHO) were tested to set up a serum free culture of the suspension-adapted Vero cells (VeroS) in shake flasks. Cell density levels higher than 2 × 106 cells/mL were obtained in the assessed conditions. The results were comparable to those obtained in spinner culture of adherent Vero cells grown on Cytodex 1 microcarriers. Cell infection with LP-2061 rabies virus strain at an MOI (Multiplicity of Infection) of 0.1 and a cell density of 8 ± 0.5 × 105 cells/mL resulted in a virus titer higher than 107 FFU/mL in all media tested. Nevertheless, the highest titer equal to 5.2 ± 0.5 × 107 FFU/mL, was achieved in IPT-AFM containing a reduced amount of Ca++ and Mg++. Our results demonstrate the suitability of the obtained VeroS cells to produce rabies virus at a high titer, and pave the way to develop VeroS cells bioreactor process for rabies vaccine production.",A multivalent Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus-like particle vaccine capable of eliciting high titers of neutralizing antibodies in immunized rabbits.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201053,Vaccine,2019 06 15,"Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is an emerging pathogen and the causative agent of multiple cancers in immunocompromised patients. To date, there is no licensed prophylactic KSHV vaccine. In this study, we generated a novel subunit vaccine that incorporates four key KSHV envelope glycoproteins required for viral entry in diverse cell types (gpK8.1, gB, and gH/gL) into a single multivalent KSHV-like particle (KSHV-LP). Purified KSHV-LPs were similar in size, shape, and morphology to KSHV virions. Vaccination of rabbits with adjuvanted KSHV-LPs generated strong glycoprotein-specific antibody responses, and purified immunoglobulins from KSHV-LP-immunized rabbits neutralized KSHV infection in epithelial, endothelial, fibroblast, and B cell lines (60-90% at the highest concentration tested). These findings suggest that KSHV-LPs may be an ideal platform for developing a safe and effective prophylactic KSHV vaccine. We envision performing future studies in animal models that are susceptible to KSHV infection, to determine correlates of immune protection in vivo.",Immune response and protective efficacy of the S particle presented rotavirus VP8* vaccine in mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201052,Vaccine,2019 06 15,"Rotaviruses cause severe diarrhea in infants and young children, leading to significant morbidity and mortality. Despite implementation of current rotavirus vaccines, severe diarrhea caused by rotaviruses still claims ∼200,000 lives of children with great economic loss worldwide each year. Thus, new prevention strategies with high efficacy are highly demanded. Recently, we have developed a polyvalent protein nanoparticle derived from norovirus VP1, the S particle, and applied it to display rotavirus neutralizing antigen VP8* as a vaccine candidate (S-VP8*) against rotavirus, which showed promise as a vaccine based on mouse immunization and in vitro neutralization studies. Here we further evaluated this S-VP8* nanoparticle vaccine in a mouse rotavirus challenge model. S-VP8* vaccines containing the murine rotavirus (EDIM strain) VP8* antigens (S-mVP8*) were constructed and immunized mice, resulting in high titers of anti-EDIM VP8* IgG. The S-mVP8* nanoparticle vaccine protected immunized mice against challenge of the homologous murine EDIM rotavirus at a high efficacy of 97% based on virus shedding reduction in stools compared with unimmunized controls. Our study further supports the polyvalent S-VP8* nanoparticles as a promising vaccine candidate against rotavirus and warrants further development.",Can We Improve the Preoperative Prediction of Prostate Cancer Recurrence With Multiparametric MRI?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201051,Clinical genitourinary cancer,2019 06 15,"The use of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) to assess prostate cancer (PCa) has increased over the past decade.

It is thought to be useful to measure serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cytokine levels for better understanding the pathological condition in encephalopathy, but there have been no reports in acute encephalopathy with IgAV. We describe an 8-year-old boy with IgAV who had neurological sequelae after complication of acute encephalopathy, focusing on the cytokine profiles and unique biphasic findings of magnetic resonance imaging. He presented with status epilepticus and mildly intensified area in the occipital lobe on the fluid-attenuated inversion recovery view. Arterial spin labeling (ASL) revealed the reduction of cerebral blood flow in the left hemisphere. On day 5 of illness, these abnormal findings disappeared, but delayed hyperintensity lesions on diffusion-weighted images newly emerged. Furthermore, CSF interleukin (IL)-6 levels markedly increased without elevated levels of IL-10 during the acute phase of disease. He suffered from long-lasting hemiparesis and intellectual impairment. In conclusion, acute encephalopathy with IgAV could cause neurological sequelae by prolonged seizure, and elevated IL-6 in CSF and laterality of cerebral blood flow in ASL might be useful to predict the prognosis of CNS dysfunction of IgAV.",Cephalosporin-related neurotoxicity: Metabolic encephalopathy or non-convulsive status epilepticus?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201049,Journal of clinical neuroscience : official journal of the Neurosurgical Society of Australasia,2019 06 15,"Metabolic encephalopathy and Non-Convulsive Status Epilepticus (NCSE) have been reported with cephalosporin use, particularly cefepime. We aimed to analyze the clinical and EEG findings in patients with cephalosporin-related neurotoxicity (CRN) at our hospital identified via the hospital EEG database, and to critically review CRN case reports in the literature. A Medline search was performed to identify CRN cases where a representative sample of EEG was provided. EEGs were analyzed using published criteria differentiating NCSE from triphasic waves (TW). Eleven patients at our hospital were identified with CRN (9 cefepime, 2 ceftriaxone): all had an encephalopathy with decreased consciousness and/or confusion. One patient had clinical seizures and 6 had multifocal myoclonus. All patients had abnormal EEGs, all with moderate to severe generalized slowing and 10 also with TW. Recovery was related to cephalosporin withdrawal rather than antiepileptic therapy. Analysis of 37 EEG samples of CRN patients reported in the literature as NCSE (30) or TW (7) revealed that most did not meet criteria for NCSE, with 33 showing TW, 1 showing generalised epileptiform discharges and 3 being uninterpretable. CRN usually produces a toxic encephalopathy rather than NCSE, and is commonly associated with triphasic waves on EEG. In most patients anti-epileptic and/or sedative drugs do not hasten clinical improvement."

Although genetic testing helps guide clinical diagnosis and management, testing recommendations are based on personal and family history of cancer and ethnicity, and many carriers are being missed. Herein, we report the results from 23,179 individuals who were referred for 30-gene next-generation sequencing panel testing for hereditary cancer risk, independent of current testing guidelines-38.7% of individuals would not have met National Comprehensive Cancer Network criteria for genetic testing. We identified a total of 2811 pathogenic variants in 2698 individuals for an overall pathogenic frequency of 11.6% (9.1%, excluding common low-penetrance alleles). Among individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish descent, three-quarters of pathogenic variants were outside of the three common BRCA1 and BRCA2 founder alleles. Across all ethnic groups, pathogenic variants in BRCA1 and BRCA2 occurred most frequently, but the contribution of pathogenic variants in other genes on the panel varied.

This process is a result of several factors including hyperosmolarity, oxidative stress, and exposure to xenobiotics, and is characterized by the breakdown of membrane phospholipid asymmetry, the clustering of band 3, and the generation of red blood cell-derived microparticles. Under pathological conditions, the liver is the primary site of erythrocyte clearance and plays an important role in iron recycling. Phosphatidylserine exposure and band-3 clustering on eryptotic erythrocytes represent mainly pro-phagocytic signals. Further, the percentage of eryptotic erythrocytes is enhanced in the circulating blood of patients with hepatic failure, hyperbilirubinemia, and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.

Accordingly, a phantom with known-speed-of-sound inclusions (e.g., containing water and saltwater solution) under the control of temperature was developed. In addition, an oil gel was used as the phantom material for mimicking wave refraction from fatty breast tissue to dense breast tissue. The oil gel was generated by adding SEBS (styrene-ethylene/butylene-styrene, 10% w/w) to paraffin oil. The oil gel-based phantom has a cylindrical shape and contains rod-shaped inclusions that can be filled with water or saltwater solution (3.5% w/w sodium chloride in water). When temperature increases, the speed of sound in the water increases, while that in the oil gel decreases; in particular, the speed of sound in the oil gel was higher than that in the water at temperatures <20.6°C, while the speed of sound in the oil gel was lower than that in the water at temperatures >20.6°C. It has been reported that the speed of sound in dense breast tissue is higher than that in water, while that in fatty breast tissue is lower than that in water. Ultrasound is refracted owing to the difference between the speed of sound in the breast tissue and that in the background water. By controlling the temperatures of the oil gel and water, the oil gel-based phantom simulates the refraction of an ultrasound wave from fatty breast tissue to dense breast tissue. For 43 d, the variation ranges of the speed of sound and attenuation in the oil gel in the reconstructed images were 0.7 m/s and 0.03 dB/MHz/cm, respectively. The concentration of the saltwater solution in the polyacrylamide gel-based phantom decreased from 1% (w/w) to 0.48% (w/w) after 24 h, while that in the oil-gel-based phantom was constant. In addition, magnetic resonance imaging of the oil gel-based phantom revealed that NiSO4 solution was stably contained in the phantom for 42 d. It is therefore concluded that the liquid cannot penetrate the oil gel. This oil gel-based phantom with such high temporal stability is suitable for multicenter distribution and may be used for standardization of data acquisition and image reconstruction across centers.",Quantitative Time-Harmonic Ultrasound Elastography of the Abdominal Aorta and Inferior Vena Cava.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201021,Ultrasound in medicine & biology,2019 06 15,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the sensitivity of quantitative time-harmonic ultrasound elastography (THE) of the inferior vena cava (IVC) and abdominal aorta (AA) to changes in central volume status. THE of the IVC and AA was performed in 20 healthy volunteers before and after oral intake of 1 L of water and before or during passive leg raising to augment venous filling. Compound maps of shear wave speed (SWS) as surrogate measures of vessel wall stiffness were generated within the full field of view from multifrequency harmonic wave fields. SWS was measured in regions of the IVC and AA. Blood pressure, stroke volume, cardiac output and pulse wave velocity were recorded. Statistical significance of SWS changes was tested using one-way repeated-measures analysis of variance. SWS measured in the IVC increased from 1.71 ± 0.1 m/s before water intake to 1.82 ± 0.1 m/s during passive leg raising and, further, to 1.87 ± 0.1 m/s after hydration and to 1.95 ± 0.1 m/s with hydration plus passive leg raising (p < 0.001). SWS in the AA did not change significantly after hydration (2.14 ± 0.13 m/s vs. 2.15 ± 0.16 m/s; p = 0.792). SWS was significantly higher in the AA than in the IVC across all experiments (p < 0.001). Water drinking did not significantly influence blood pressure, pulse wave velocity and cardiac output (all p values >0.1), whereas stroke volume increased significantly (p = 0.031). Time-harmonic ultrasound elastography enables quantification of the wall stiffness of the large abdominal vessels and is sensitive to different volume and pressure states in the IVC.",The Influencing Factors of Venous Intravasation During Transvaginal Four-dimensional Hysterosalpingo-contrast Sonography With SonoVue.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201020,Ultrasound in medicine & biology,2019 06 15,"Transvaginal 4-D hysterosalpingo-contrast sonography with SonoVue (TV 4-D HyCoSy) is the preferred imaging method for evaluating tubal patency. However, venous intravasation in 4-D HyCoSy may affect the diagnosis of tubal patency. The objective of this study was to analyze influencing factors of venous intravasation during TV 4-D HyCoSy. This study included 643 infertile patients who underwent TV 4-D HyCoSy. We analyzed the relationship between the incidence of venous intravasation and patients' basic clinical data, endometrial thickness, inspection timing (clean day of menstruation) and tubal patency. A total of 169 (26.28%) patients exhibited intravasation during TV 4-D HyCoSy. The following are risk factors for venous intravation: secondary infertility, type C + C, type B + C and type B + B in bilateral fallopian tubal patency grouping; endometrial thickness ≤5.45 mm; and taking TV 4-D HyCoSy after menstruation ≤6 d. Infertility duration, intrauterine lesions, a history of pelvic inflammatory disease and a history of pelvic surgery were uncorrelated with venous intravasation. To reduce the incidence of venous intravasation, TV 4-D HyCoSy should be performed 7-10 d after menstruation or when endometrial thickness is thicker than 5.45 mm.",An in vitro study of a novel quaternary ammonium silane endodontic irrigant.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201019,Dental materials : official publication of the Academy of Dental Materials,2019 06 15,"To analyze effect of NaOCl+2% quaternary ammonium silane (QAS)-containing novel irrigant against bacteria impregnated inside the root canal system, and to evaluate its antimicrobial and mechanical potential of dentine substrate.",High strength polymer/silicon nitride composites for dental restorations.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201018,Dental materials : official publication of the Academy of Dental Materials,2019 06 15,To fabricate polymer-infiltrated silicon nitride composite (PISNC) and evaluate the potential of PISNC in dental application.

The next disruption came with the introduction of continuous flow pumps characterized by a low-pulse pressure circulation. Since the mechanism of action did not involve displacement of blood, these pumps were much smaller and less noisy in part due to fewer moving parts. Such devices include the HeartMate II axial-flow pathway pump which is implanted thoraco-abdominally and the HVAD, a centrifugal-flow pathway pump which is smaller and is implanted entirely within the thoracic cavity and uses a combination of hydrodynamic and magnetic levitation of the internal rotor. These pumps improved survival compared with the early generation LVADs and in a trial, the HVAD demonstrated non-inferiority compared with the HeartMate II but with an increase in ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes. The HeartMate 3 LVAD is an intrapericardial centrifugal-flow pathway pump with a full magnetically levitated, frictionless rotor with a fixed intrinsic pulse. In a randomized trial, the HeartMate 3 ""hybrid"" pump was associated with near-elimination of pump thrombosis, a reduction in strokes of any type or severity and lower mucosal bleeding rates.

Paraneoplastic movement disorders are a heterogeneous group of syndromes encompassing both hyperkinetic and hypokinetic conditions, characterized by acute/sub-acute onset, rapidly progressive evolution, and multifocal localizations with several overlapping features. These movement disorders are immune-mediated, as shown by the rapid onset and by the presence of antineuronal antibodies in biological samples of patients, fundamental for the diagnosis. Antineuronal antibodies could be targeted against intracellular or neuronal surface antigens. Paraneoplastic movement disorders associated with anti-neuronal surface antigens antibodies respond more frequently to immunotherapy. The underlying tumors may be different, according to the clinical presentation, age, and gender of patients. Our search considered articles involving human subjects indexed in PubMed.

Accurate classification is essential both for appropriate risk stratification and for guiding clinical management. Once classified almost exclusively based on the morphologic appearance of the tumor by light microscopy, many soft tissue sarcomas are now known to manifest recurrent patterns of genetic alterations. In addition to enabling molecular confirmation of histologic diagnoses, discovery of these recurrent genetic alterations has helped to refine existing morphologic definitions of sarcoma subtypes and even prompted the discovery of new subtypes. As therapy for sarcoma has become increasingly tailored to a specific entity, the integration of molecular data has assumed added importance in diagnostic decision making. In this article, we summarize principles of the histologic evaluation of soft tissue sarcomas, discuss specific diagnostic features of several of the most common sarcoma subtypes, and describe our vision for a future of soft tissue sarcoma diagnosis that merges morphologic, genetic, and epigenetic features to arrive at diagnoses that are aligned with tumor-specific, biologically targeted treatment approaches."

An investigation into preferences for physical activity using a stated preference approach.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31200947,"Health policy (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",2019 06 15,"The positive life-prolonging effect of physical activity is often used as a promotion argument to motivate people to change their behaviour. Yet the decision of investing in health by exercising depends not only on the potential health effect but also on the costs of physical activity including time costs and the individual's (dis)utility of performing physical activity. The objective of this study was to investigate the trade-off between costs and benefits of engaging in physical activity. A web-based stated preference experiment was conducted to elicit individual preferences for physical activity among a representative sample of the Danish population, 18-60 years of age, categorised as moderately physically active or physically inactive. The results of the study suggest that perceived negative quality of life impact of physical activity is an important predictor of the choice of not attending physical activity, and hence should be acknowledged as a barrier to engaging in physical activity. Furthermore, we find time costs to have a significant impact on stated uptake. For individuals categorised as moderately active, the marginal health effect of physical activity is significant but minor. For inactive individuals, this effect is insignificant suggesting that information on long-term health effects does not work as motivation for engaging in exercise for this group. Instead, focus should be on reducing the perceived disutility of physical activity.",The Impact of Centromeres on Spatial Genome Architecture.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31200946,Trends in genetics : TIG,2019 06 15,"The development of new technologies and experimental techniques is enabling researchers to see what was once unable to be seen.

Here we examined whether 12 months of intradialytic protein supplementation and endurance exercise improves physical function, risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), and QOL in HD patients in a randomized controlled trial (RCT). A total of 138 HD patients (average age 58 years) were assigned for 12 months to control, intradialytic protein, or protein plus exercise groups. The protein and protein plus exercise groups consumed an oral protein supplement (30 grams of whey) three days/week during dialysis. The protein plus exercise group cycled for 30-45 minutes during dialysis treatment. The primary outcome was change in physical function at 12 months, assessed by a shuttle walk test. Secondary outcomes included arterial stiffness, blood pressure, body composition, muscle strength, markers of nutritional status, and QOL. Assessments were conducted at baseline, 6 and 12 months. In total, 101 patients completed the intervention. There were no significant differences between groups in shuttle walk test performance from baseline to 12 months. There were trends for improvements in some secondary measures of physical function and strength in the protein and protein plus exercise groups at six or 12 months, but these did not reach statistical significance. Thus, our trial did not demonstrate significant improvements in markers of physical function, risk of CVD or QOL after one year of intradialytic oral OPS and aerobic exercise training. More comprehensive lifestyle management may be needed to uncover robust improvements in the health and QOL of HD patients.",A transgenic mouse model reproduces human hereditary systemic amyloidosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31200944,Kidney international,2019 06 15,"Amyloidoses are rare life-threatening diseases caused by protein misfolding of normally soluble proteins. The fatal outcome is predominantly due to renal failure and/or cardiac dysfunction. Because amyloid fibrils formed by all amyloidogenic proteins share structural similarity, amyloidoses may be studied in transgenic models expressing any amyloidogenic protein. Here we generated transgenic mice expressing an amyloidogenic variant of human apolipoprotein AII, a major protein of high density lipoprotein. According to amyloid nomenclature this variant was termed STOP78SERApoAII. STOP78SER-APOA2 expression at the physiological level spontaneously induced systemic amyloidosis in all mice with full-length mature STOP78SER-ApoAII identified as the amyloidogenic protein. Amyloid deposits stained with Congo red were extracellular, and consisted of fibrils of approximately 10 nm diameter. Renal glomerular amyloidosis was a major feature with onset of renal insufficiency occurring in mice older than six months of age. The liver, heart and spleen were also greatly affected. Expression of STOP78SER-APOA2 in the liver and intestine in mice of the K line but not in other amyloid-laden organs showed they present systemic amyloidosis. The amyloid burden was a function of STOP78SER-APOA2 expression and age of the mice with amyloid deposition starting in two-month-old high-expressing mice that died from six months onwards. Because STOP78SER-ApoAII conserved adequate lipid binding capacity as shown by high STOP78SER-ApoAII amounts in high density lipoprotein of young mice, its decrease in circulation with age suggests preferential deposition into preformed fibrils. Thus, our mouse model faithfully reproduces early-onset hereditary systemic amyloidosis and is ideally suited to devise and test novel therapies.",Dual lineage tracing shows that glomerular parietal epithelial cells can transdifferentiate toward the adult podocyte fate.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31200942,Kidney international,2019 06 15,"Podocytes are differentiated post-mitotic cells that cannot replace themselves after injury. Glomerular parietal epithelial cells are proposed to be podocyte progenitors. To test whether a subset of parietal epithelial cells transdifferentiate to a podocyte fate, dual reporter PEC-rtTA|LC1|tdTomato|Nphs1-FLPo|FRT-EGFP mice, named PEC-PODO, were generated. Doxycycline administration permanently labeled parietal epithelial cells with tdTomato reporter (red), and upon doxycycline removal, the parietal epithelial cells (PECs) cannot label further. Despite the presence or absence of doxycycline, podocytes cannot label with tdTomato, but are constitutively labeled with an enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) reporter (green). Only activation of the Nphs1-FLPo transgene by labeled parietal epithelial cells can generate a yellow color. At day 28 of experimental focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, podocyte density was 20% lower in 20% of glomeruli. At day 56 of experimental focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, podocyte density was 18% lower in 17% of glomeruli. TdTomato+ parietal epithelial cells were restricted to Bowman's capsule in healthy mice. However, by days 28 and 56 of experimental disease, two-thirds of tdTomato+ parietal epithelial cells within glomerular tufts were yellow in color. These cells co-expressed the podocyte markers podocin, nephrin, p57 and VEGF164, but not markers of endothelial (ERG) or mesangial (Perlecan) cells. Expansion microscopy showed primary, secondary and minor processes in tdTomato+EGFP+ cells in glomerular tufts. Thus, our studies provide strong evidence that parietal epithelial cells serve as a source of new podocytes in adult mice.",An international Delphi survey helped develop consensus-based core outcome domains for trials in peritoneal dialysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31200941,Kidney international,2019 06 15,"Shared decision-making about clinical care options in end-stage kidney disease is limited by inconsistencies in the reporting of outcomes and the omission of patient-important outcomes in trials. Here we generated a consensus-based prioritized list of outcomes to be reported during trials in peritoneal dialysis (PD). In an international, online, three-round Delphi survey, patients/caregivers and health professionals rated the importance of outcomes using a 9-point Likert scale (with 7-9 indicating critical importance) and provided comments. Using a Best-Worst Scale (BWS), the relative importance of outcomes was estimated. Comments were analyzed thematically. In total, 873 participants (207 patients/caregivers and 666 health professionals) from 68 countries completed round one, 629 completed round two and 530 completed round three. The top outcomes were PD-related infection, membrane function, peritoneal dialysis failure, cardiovascular disease, death, catheter complications, and the ability to do usual activities. Compared with health professionals, patients/caregivers gave higher priority to six outcomes: blood pressure (mean difference, 0.4), fatigue (0.3), membrane function (0.3), impact on family/friends (0.1), peritoneal thickening (0.1) and usual activities (0.1). Four themes were identified that underpinned the reasons for ratings: contributing to treatment longevity, preserving quality of life, escalating morbidity, and irrelevant and futile information and treatment. Patients/caregivers and health professionals gave highest priority to clinical outcomes. In contrast to health professionals, patients/caregivers gave higher priority to lifestyle-related outcomes including the impact on family/friends and usual activities. Thus, prioritization will inform a core outcome set to improve the consistency and relevance of outcomes for trials in PD.",Associations of physical activity and sedentary time with lipoprotein subclasses in Norwegian schoolchildren: The Active Smarter Kids (ASK) study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31200940,Atherosclerosis,2019 06 15,Physical activity is favourably associated with certain markers of lipid metabolism.

We intended to provide better insight in the behavior of the gas via direct concentration measurements and visualization of the gas cloud.",Mechanochemical Coupling and Junctional Forces during Collective Cell Migration.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31200935,Biophysical journal,2019 06 15,"Cell migration, a fundamental physiological process in which cells sense and move through their surrounding physical environment, plays a critical role in development and tissue formation, as well as pathological processes, such as cancer metastasis and wound healing. During cell migration, dynamics are governed by the bidirectional interplay between cell-generated mechanical forces and the activity of Rho GTPases, a family of small GTP-binding proteins that regulate actin cytoskeleton assembly and cellular contractility. These interactions are inherently more complex during the collective migration of mechanically coupled cells because of the additional regulation of cell-cell junctional forces. In this study, we adapted a recent minimal modeling framework to simulate the interactions between mechanochemical signaling in individual cells and interactions with cell-cell junctional forces during collective cell migration. We find that migration of individual cells depends on the feedback between mechanical tension and Rho GTPase activity in a biphasic manner. During collective cell migration, waves of Rho GTPase activity mediate mechanical contraction/extension and thus synchronization throughout the tissue. Further, cell-cell junctional forces exhibit distinct spatial patterns during collective cell migration, with larger forces near the leading edge. Larger junctional force magnitudes are associated with faster collective cell migration and larger tissue size. Simulations of heterogeneous tissue migration exhibit a complex dependence on the properties of both leading and trailing cells. Computational predictions demonstrate that collective cell migration depends on both the emergent dynamics and interactions between cellular-level Rho GTPase activity and contractility and multicellular-level junctional forces."
