Forty incisor teeth from 10 rabbits were treated. Thirty-six teeth received class V cavity preparations with partial pulpotomy and application of either propolis or calcium hydroxide paste. Similar cavity preparations were performed in 2 teeth without any capping material as a positive control, whereas 2 teeth without the cavity preparation served as a negative control. Histological evaluation showed that both groups had dentin bridge formation. Dentinal tubules in the dentin bridge were more orderly arranged in the Thai propolis group than in the calcium hydroxide group. Wound healing and the median number of hyperemic blood vessels were not statistically significant different between the 2 groups.

Micro-area X-ray spectrometry and infrared spectroscopy revealed calcium oxalate monohydrate in the outside and uric acid in the inside. We also examined the interface. After the outside, inside, and interface parts were separated, proteomic analysis identified 48, 7, and 4 matrix proteins, respectively. Urinary stones with two layers are considered to have grown under different conditions. The matrix proteins in each part differed among the crystal components and may reveal the stone-generating process. The proteins in the interface likely function to enlarge the stone via the addition of different crystals.",Redox and pH responsive polymeric vesicles constructed from a water-soluble pillar[5]arene and a paraquat-containing block copolymer for rate-tunable controlled release.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30587090,Journal of biomaterials science.

This study examined the experiences of researchers recruiting public high schools for a randomized controlled trial to reduce suicide disparities for sexual and gender minority (SGM) youth by implementing evidence-based strategies to enhance school environments. We enrolled 42 schools throughout New Mexico between August 2016 and April 2017. Based on qualitative analysis of recruitment efforts, three groups of factors affected enrollment: (1) non-SGM-specific factors, (2) SGM-specific factors, and (3) facilitating factors. Non-SGM-specific factors negatively impacted the willingness or ability to participate (e.g., demanding staff workloads and beliefs that ""outsiders"" should not assist with school-based interventions). Notable SGM-specific factors centered on influences in socially conservative community environments and beliefs that schools lacked SGM students. Advocacy, leveraging relationships, and persistence were facilitating factors for overcoming recruitment obstacles. Our findings have implications for researchers and school nurses interested in school-based interventions, especially those focused on SGM youth.",Vascular extracellular adenosine metabolism in mice correlates with susceptibility to atherosclerosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30587087,"Nucleosides, nucleotides & nucleic acids",2019 04 12,"Animal models are widely used in atherosclerosis research. The most useful, economic and valid is mouse genetic model of this pathology. Purinergic signaling is an important mechanism regulating processes involved in the vascular inflammation and atherosclerosis. The aim of this study was to measure vascular activities of nucleotide and adenosine-degrading ecto-enzymes in different strains of mice and to compare them to atherosclerotic susceptibility. The vascular extracellular nucleotide catabolism pathway was analyzed in 6-month-old male genetically unmodified mouse strains: FVB/NJ, DBA/2J, BALB/c, C57Bl/6J and mouse knock-outs on C57Bl/6J background for LDLR (LDLR-/-) and for ApoE and LDLR (ApoE-/-LDLR-/-). LDLR-/- mice were a model of moderate hypercholesterolemia, while ApoE-/-LDLR-/- mice, a model of severe hypercholesterolemia with advanced atherosclerosis. FVB/NJ, DBA/2J and BALB/c mice showed high rates of vascular extracellular AMP hydrolysis and low activity of adenosine deamination. In turn, all mice with the C57Bl/6J background expressed diminished activity of vascular AMP hydrolysis. Mice with genetically-induced hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis on the C57Bl/6J background revealed increased ecto-adenosine deaminase activity. Mouse strains that were resistant to atherosclerosis (FVB/NJ, DBA/2J, BALB/c) exhibited a protective extracellular vascular ecto-enzyme pattern directed toward the production of anti-inflammatory and anti-atherosclerotic adenosine. In turn, mice with genetically induced hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis expressed disturbed activities of ecto-5'nucleotidase and ecto-adenosine deaminase related to decreased production and increased degradation of extracellular adenosine.",Long non-coding RNA POLR2E gene polymorphisms increased the risk of prostate cancer in a sample of the Iranian population.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30587086,"Nucleosides, nucleotides & nucleic acids",2019 05 13,"The current study aimed to examine the impact of POLR2E rs1046040 and rs3787016 polymorphisms on prostate cancer (PCa) risk in a sample of southeast Iranian population. The present case-control study was performed on 178 patients with PCa and 180 benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Genotyping of the variants was done by mismatch PCR-RFLP. The findings showed that the rs3787016 C > T variant significantly increased the risk of PCa in codominant (OR = 1.84, 95% CI = 1.12-3.03, P = 0.018, CT vs CC), dominant (OR = 1.88, 95% CI = 1.63-3.05, P = 0.011, CT + TT vas CC) and allele (OR = 1.77, 95% CI = 1.52-2.72, P = 0.010, T vs C) inheritance model. Regarding rs1046040 C > T polymorphism, the findings revealed that the CT genotype significantly increased the risk of PCa compared to the CC genotype (OR = 1.60, 95% CI = 1.03-2.49, P = 0.043). Furthermore, rs3787016 CT/rs1046040 CC as well as rs3787016 CT/rs1046040 CT increased the risk of PCa compared to the CC/CC genotype (p = 0.029 and p = 0.014, respectively). Haplotype analysis proposed that rs3787016 T/rs1046040 C significantly increased the risk of PCa compared to C/C (p = 0.037). No significant association was observed between POLR2E variants and clinicopathological characteristics of PCa patients. In conclusion, the findings propose that POLR2E variants may be a risk factor for susceptibility to PCa in a sample of Iranian population.",Plasmid-DNA lipid and polymeric nanovaccines: a new strategic in vaccines development.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30587085,Biotechnology & genetic engineering reviews,2019 05 09,"Vaccination is the most effective and least expensive technique used for human diseases prevention and eradication. The need for more vaccine doses and the rapid establishment of facilities for the development of new vaccines are stimulating significate changes in the vaccine industry, which is gradually moving towards cell culture production. One approach is the third generation of vaccines, which are based on the use of plasmid DNA (pDNA) containing transgenes that encode an antigen capable of mimicking intracellular pathogenic infection and triggering both humoral and cellular immune responses. Plasmid DNA vaccination has distinct advantages over other vaccine technologies in terms of safety, ease of fabrication and stability. The effectiveness of pDNA vaccines against viruses, bacteria, parasites and cancer cells has been demonstrated in preclinical and clinical assays. Furthermore, currently there are a few veterinary pDNA vaccines in the market. The application of a simple formulation of naked pDNA as a vaccine is attractive, but a low transfection efficiency is often obtained. The use of nanoparticles to increase transfection efficiency is an approach that has been tested clinically. This review provides a summary of vaccine production, advances and major challenges associated with pDNA lipid and polymeric nanovaccines applications.",Learning while multitasking: short and long-term benefits of brain stimulation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30587084,Ergonomics,2019 06 13,"We employed a simulated production task that mimics the real-world skill acquisition required of operators working in control rooms of power plants to assess short and long-term effects of transcranial random noise stimulation (tRNS). tRNS has shown potential for enhancing learning and performance of cognitive skills. Forty subjects (24 female) learned how to execute the simulated production task during the training phase and were required to perform a secondary task during the skill acquisition phase while they received active (12 min) or sham tRNS on DLPFC. After 2 weeks they had to recall the task again without any stimulation. The results demonstrate that tRNS promoted better multitasking as reflected by better performance in a secondary task during and immediately after tRNS. However, 2 weeks later, beneficial effect of tRNS on retention was moderated by general mental ability. Particularly, tRNS benefited those with lower general mental ability. Practitioner summary: By using a simulated production task, we assessed the effects of tRNS on learning and skill retention. The study indicates that neurostimulation can enhance the learning of multiple complex tasks. Moreover, it shows that retention of those tasks can be supported by neurostimulation, especially for those with lower general mental ability.",Promoting Primary Palliative Care in Severe Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease: Symptom Management and Preparedness Planning.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30587083,Journal of palliative care,2019 03 19,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) poses challenges not only in symptom management but also in prognostication. Managing COPD requires clinicians to be proficient in the primary palliative care skills of symptom management and communication focused on eliciting goals and preferences. Dyspnea should initially be managed with the combination of long-acting muscarinic antagonists and long-acting β-agonist inhalers, adding inhaled corticosteroids if symptoms persist. Opioids for the relief of dyspnea are safe when used at appropriate doses. Oxygen is only effective for relieving dyspnea in patients with severe hypoxemia. The relapsing-remitting nature of COPD makes prognostication challenging; however, there are tools to guide clinicians and patients in making plans both with respect to prognosis and symptom burden. Preparedness planning techniques promote detailed culturally appropriate conversations which allow patients and clinicians to consider disease-specific complications and develop goal-concordant treatment plans."

The organisms Artemia salina and Lactuca sativa were exposed to the leachate in different dilution. In the phytotoxicity evaluation, the inhibition of root (RGI) and radicle (RAGI) growth, and the number of germinated seeds (GR) were evaluated. In the ecotoxicity analysis, the 50% lethal dose (LD50) for each type of treatment was evaluated. The raw leachate, and after treatments PF, Bio and PF-Bio presented COD of 12,797, 1,347, 1,685, 220 mg/L and BOD5 of 4,251, 1,060, 692 and 89 mg/L, respectively. The GR was 0, 95, 25 and 40%, RGI was 100, 83, 100, 93%, whereas RAGI was 100, 72, 100 and 79% in the raw leachate and after treatments PF, Bio and PF-Bio, respectively. LD50 values of 0.25, 0.40, 0.38 and 0.54 were obtained for the raw effluent and after the PF, Bio and PF-Bio treatments, respectively. Smaller values of COD, BOD5, ecotoxicity and phytotoxicity were observed in the effluent after the PF-Bio treatment, indicating that this is the most environmentally suitable system for the treatment of landfill leachate.",An in vivo Evaluation of the Ontogeny of Stereoselective Fluoxetine Metabolism and Disposition in Lambs from Birth to One Year of Age.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30587071,Xenobiotica; the fate of foreign compounds in biological systems,2018 12 27,"1. The objective was to determine the ontogeny of stereoselective fluoxetine (FX) disposition in postnatal sheep from newborn to adulthood. 2. Catheters were implanted in a carotid artery and jugular vein. FX was administered intravenously, followed by serial arterial blood and cumulative urine collection. The concentrations of R,S-FX and R,S-norfluoxetine (R,S-NFX) in samples were measured using a validated enantioselective LC/MS/MS analytical method. 3. The metabolism of FX at 4.2 ± 0.4 days was limited compared to adults, but had developed compared to the fetus. Total body clearance (ClTB) did not significantly increase up to 33.6 ± 0.9 days, but significantly increased at 98.5 ± 2.0 days, with no further changes up to 397.3 ± 8.5 days. Up to 13.4 ± 0.8 days, the disposition of FX included Phase I metabolism to NFX and trifluoromethylphenol (TFMP), and renal elimination. At 32.9 ± 0.9 days, metabolism included Phase II conjugates of FX and NFX. Renal elimination of these compounds was low. 4. The elimination of FX increased in a non-linear manner during the first year in sheep. The metabolism and disposition of FX and NFX in plasma and urine were stereoselective and this appeared due to both stereoselective protein binding and metabolism.",Mitochondrial DNA marker (D-loop) reveals high genetic diversity but low population structure in the pale bent-wing bat (Miniopterus pallidus) in Iran.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30587070,"Mitochondrial DNA. Part A, DNA mapping, sequencing, and analysis",2019 04 10,"This study investigates the population genetic structure of Miniopterus pallidus using the D-loop region of mitochondrial DNA (331 bp) from 13 localities in Iran. We found a high number of haplotypes (N = 43) and high nucleotide diversity (π = 0.02). The average K2P genetic distance was high within (2.59%) and between (2.54%) the Iranian populations of M. pallidus and analysis of molecular variance revealed that most genetic variability was related to differences within populations. The positive and significant association between pairwise genetic and environmental distances (r = 0.443, p = .01) after accounting for the effect of geographical distances suggests that substantial influence of the climatic factors among different sites have shaped the genetic variation in this species. Neutrality tests showed historical demographic events when applying Fu's Fs, but Tajima's statistic was nonsignificant, indicating a deviation from the theoretical model of expansion. The hypothesis of sudden-expansion was not rejected by analyses of mismatch distribution as the Raggedness and SSD were insignificant (p(r)= .39 and p(SSD) =  .38). Similarly, BSP results approximately revealed a major historical expansion around 81,000 years ago and a recent population decline around 13,000 years ago. Phylogenetic trees illustrated that all Iranian M. pallidus populations, as well as those from eastern Turkey and Azerbaijan, form a monophyletic clade, whereas the samples from western Turkey, Georgia and Greece belong to M. schreibersii clade. The haplotype network was consistent with these findings for M. pallidus populations in Iran and showed a high level of reticulation.",Sex Differences in Receiving Layperson Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation in Pediatric Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest: A Nationwide Cohort Study in Japan.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30587069,Journal of the American Heart Association,2019 03 29,"Background Layperson cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( CPR ) is a crucial intervention for patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest ( OHCA ). Although a sex disparity in receiving layperson CPR (ie, female patients were less likely to receive layperson CPR ) has been reported in adults, there are few data in the pediatric population, and we therefore investigated sex differences in receiving layperson CPR in pediatric patients with OHCA . Methods and Results From the All-Japan Utstein Registry, a prospective, nationwide, population-based OHCA database, we included pediatric patients (≤17 years) with layperson-witnessed OHCA from 2005 through 2015. The primary outcome was receiving layperson CPR . Patient sex was the main exposure. We fitted multivariable logistic regression models to examine associations between patient sex and receiving layperson CPR . We included a total of 4525 pediatric patients with layperson-witnessed OHCA in this study, 1669 (36.9%) of whom were female. Female patients received layperson CPR more often than male patients (831/1669 [49.8%] versus 1336/2856 [46.8%], P=0.05). After adjustment for age, time of day of arrest, year, witnesses persons, and dispatcher CPR instruction, the sex difference in receiving layperson CPR was not significant (adjusted odds ratio for female subjects 1.14, 95% CI, 0.996-1.31). Conclusions In a pediatric population, female patients with layperson-witnessed OHCA received layperson CPR more often than male patients. After adjustment for covariates, there was no significant association between patient sex and receiving layperson CPR .","Effects of MDR1 1236C > T-2677G > T-3435C > T polymorphisms on the intracellular accumulation of tacrolimus, cyclosporine A, sirolimus and everolimus.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30587068,Xenobiotica; the fate of foreign compounds in biological systems,2019 06 14,"1. Overexpression of P-glycoprotein (P-gp, encoded by MDR1) mediates resistance to multiple immunosuppressors. Several common MDR1 variants (1236C > T, 2677G > T, 3435C > T) impact the efflux activity of P-gp-mediated substrates. We assessed the effect of these polymorphisms on the sensitivity, intracellular accumulation, and efflux of tacrolimus, cyclosporine A, sirolimus and everolimus in transfected LLC-PK1 cells. 2. LLC-PK1 cell lines were transfected with empty vector (pcDNA3.1) and recombinant MDR1T-T-T, MDR1C-T-T, MDR1C-G-T and MDR1C-G-C vectors, respectively and further screened in the presence of puromycin. The IC50 values, intracellular accumulation, and apparent permeability ratios of tacrolimus, cyclosporine A, sirolimus and everolimus were evaluated. 3. MDR1 overexpression increased the resistance of LLC-PK1 cells to tacrolimus, cyclosporine A, sirolimus and everolimus. The resistance of cells expressing MDR1C-G-C wild-type haplotypes to tacrolimus were increased compared to MDR1T-T-T, MDR1C-T-T, MDR1C-G-T variant haplotypes. The efflux ability of P-gp-mediated tacrolimus in cells transfected with MDR1C-G-C was higher than cells overexpressing MDR1T-T-T, MDR1C-T-T, MDR1C-G-T variant haplotypes. In addition, the resistance of cells expressing MDR1C-G-C wild-type haplotypes to sirolimus were increased compared to MDR1C-T-T, MDR1C-G-T variant haplotypes. The efflux ability of P-gp-mediated sirolimus in cells overexpressing MDR1C-G-C was higher than cells transfected with MDR1C-T-T, MDR1C-G-T variant haplotypes. 4. These findings indicate that wild-type MDR1 exports tacrolimus and sirolimus more efficiency than the MDR1T-T-T, MDR1C-T-T, MDR1C-G-T variant protein. This observation indicates that 1236C > T, 2677G > T, 3435C > T variant haplotypes drastically decrease the efflux ability of P-gp-mediated tacrolimus and sirolimus in a substrate-specific manner.",Hilliness and the Development of Walking Difficulties Among Community-Dwelling Older People.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30587067,Journal of aging and health,2018 12 27,"The objective of this study is to study the associations of objectively defined hilliness with the prevalence and incidence of walking difficulties among community-dwelling older adults, and to explore whether behavioral, health, or socioeconomic factors would fully or partially explain these associations.",Durability of Benefits From Supervised Treadmill Exercise in People With Peripheral Artery Disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30587066,Journal of the American Heart Association,2019 06 10,"Background It is currently unknown whether 6 months of supervised treadmill exercise has a durable benefit on 6-minute walk performance, even after exercise is completed, in people with peripheral artery disease. Methods and Results A total of 156 participants with peripheral artery disease were randomized to 1 of 3 groups: supervised treadmill exercise, supervised resistance training, or attention control. Participants received supervised sessions during months 1 to 6 and telephone contact during months 6 to 12. Primary outcomes were change in 6-minute walk distance and short physical performance battery at 6-month follow-up and have been reported previously. Secondary outcomes were change in 6-minute walk and short physical performance battery at 12-month follow-up and are reported here. A group of 134 participants (86%) completed the 12-month follow-up. At 6-month follow-up, compared with control, 6-minute walk distance improved in the treadmill exercise group (+36.1 m, 95% CI =13.9-58.3, P=0.001). Between 6- and 12-month follow-up, 6-minute walk distance significantly declined (-28.6 m, 95% CI=-52.6 to -4.5, P=0.020) and physical activity declined -272 activity units (95% CI =-546 to +2, P=0.052) in the treadmill exercise group compared with controls. At 12-month follow-up, 6 months after completing supervised treadmill exercise, change in 6-minute walk distance was not different between the treadmill exercise and control groups (+7.5, 95% CI =-17.5 to +32.6, P=0.56). There were no differences in short physical performance battery change between either exercise group and control at 6-month or 12-month follow-up. Conclusions A 6-month supervised treadmill exercise intervention that improved 6-minute walk distance at 6-month follow-up did not have persistent benefit at 12-month follow-up. These results do not support a durable benefit of supervised treadmill exercise in peripheral artery disease. Clinical Trial Registration URL : https://www.clinicaltrials.gov .

However, its potential to act as an adverse entity was greatly ignored. Recently, the toxic effect of nanoparticles on biological system is checked using various model organisms. Among various models fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster has turned up as a promising model since numerous diseased genes and signalling pathways are similar to that of a human being. Effects of many NPs were tested using Drosophila, and results suggest the deleterious effect of NPs on the various physiological system. NPs cause defects in genetic, molecular, phenotypic, developmental as well as behavioral level in Drosophila. Any chemical compounds that can cause abnormalities in offspring when ingested in prenatal stages are known as teratogens. In this review, we have summerized the toxic effect generated by NPs tested using Drosophila model and propose NPs as a teratogen.",Health Canada's Use of its Notice of Compliance With Conditions Drug Approval Policy: A Retrospective Cohort Analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30587064,"International journal of health services : planning, administration, evaluation",2019 03 18,"Health Canada has developed its Notice of Compliance with conditions (NOC/c) policy to get promising new drugs for serious diseases to market faster than would be possible through its standard approval process.

This paper investigates the additional therapeutic gain from drugs approved under this policy, the percent of drugs that have fulfilled their conditions, and the length of time for fulfillment. From the inception of the policy in 1998 to the end of 2017, 89 new drugs and new indications for existing drugs received an NOC/c. Therapeutic evaluations were available for 78 of the drugs, and 54 offered only minimal or no gains over existing products. Fifty NOC/c were fulfilled, 31 were not fulfilled, and 8 were withdrawn. The median time to fulfillment was 1,040 days. Twelve NOC/c took more than 5 years to fulfill their conditions. The unfulfilled NOC/c had been issued for a median of 1,161 days, and 10 had been issued more than 5 years. The value of the NOC/c policy to patients is uncertain.","Toonapolyynes A-D, new polyynes from Toona ciliata.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30587063,Natural product research,2018 12 27,"Phytochemical investigation on the leaves and twigs of Toona ciliata has led to the isolation of four new polyynes (1-4) and two knowns (5 and 6).

In this article, we detail the first case of MEC arising from the gallbladder, presenting in a 50-year-old male. Imaging and gross examination showed a large mass in the gallbladder fossa infiltrating the liver. This microscopically displayed the classical morphology of MEC, which was confirmed on dual immunostain for p63 and CK7 and histochemical staining for mucin. MUC and p53 immunoexpression patterns suggested a poor prognosis. The patient succumbed to the disease with liver metastasis within 6 months. The cytomorphology of the metastatic lesion is also presented. Differences in the stem cell niches in the gallbladder and the rest of the biliary tract may possibly indicate the reason for the rarity of this tumor in the gallbladder. A possibly aggressive biological behavior of the gallbladder MEC necessitates its distinction from entities like the adenosquamous carcinoma.",Percutaneous Endoscopic Necrosectomy (PEN) Combined with Percutaneous Catheter Drainage (PCD) and Irrigation for the Treatment of Clinically Relevant Pancreatic Fistula after Pancreatoduodenectomy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30587050,Journal of investigative surgery : the official journal of the Academy of Surgical Research,2019 01 16,This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of percutaneous endoscopic necrosectomy (PEN) combined with percutaneous catheter drainage (PCD) and irrigation versus PCD for the treatment of clinically relevant postoperative pancreatic fistula (CR-POPF) after pancreatoduodenectomy (PD).,Effect of teriparatide use on bone mineral density and spinal fusion: a narrative review of animal models.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30587048,The International journal of neuroscience,2019 06 05,"Purpose of the study: Teriparatide (Human recombinant Parathyroid Hormone 1-34) is an anabolic agent that is frequently used in patients with osteoporosis and has been extensively investigated with animal model and clinical studies in current literature.

In this study, we evaluated the changes in phase and power of slow cortical activity in delta and theta bands, during a motor imagery task controlled by an SMR-based BMI system. In Experiment I, EEG of 20 right-handed healthy volunteers was recorded performing a motor-imagery task using an SMR-based BMI controlling a visual animation, and during task-free intervals. In Experiment II, 10 subjects were evaluated along five daily sessions, while BMI-controlling same visual animation, a buzzer, and a robotic hand exoskeleton. In both experiments, feedback received from the controlled device was proportional to SMR power (11-14 

 Hz) detected by a real-time EEG-based system. Synchronization of slow EEG frequencies along the trials was evaluated using inter-trial-phase coherence (ITPC). Results: cortical oscillations of EEG in delta and theta frequencies synchronized at the onset and at the end of both active and task-free trials; ITPC was significantly modulated by feedback sensory modality received during the tasks; and ITPC synchronization progressively increased along the training. These findings suggest that phase-locking of slow rhythms and resetting by sensory afferences might be a functionally relevant mechanism in cortical control of motor function. We propose that analysis of phase synchronization of slow cortical rhythms might also improve identification of temporal edges in BMI tasks and might help to develop physiological markers for identification of context task switching and practice-related changes in brain function, with potentially important implications for design and monitoring of motor imagery-based BMI systems, an emerging tool in neurorehabilitation of stroke.",Temporal Modulation of Steady-State Visual Evoked Potentials.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30587045,International journal of neural systems,2019 03 18,"Electroencephalographic responses to periodic stimulation are termed steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEP). Their characteristics in terms of amplitude, frequency and phase are commonly assumed to be stationary. In this work, we tested this assumption in 30 healthy participants submitted to 50 trials of 60 

 s flicker stimulation at 15 

 Hz frequency. We showed that the amplitude of the first and second harmonic frequency components of SSVEP signals were in general not stable over time. The power (squared amplitude) of the fundamental component was stationary only in 30% the subjects, while the power at the second harmonic frequency was stationary in 66.7% of the group. The phases of both SSVEP frequency components were more stable over time, but could exhibit small drifts. The observed temporal changes were heterogeneous across the subjects, implying that averaging results over participants should be performed carefully. These results may contribute to improved design and analysis of experiments employing prolonged visual stimulation. Our findings offer a novel characterization of the temporal changes of SSVEP that may help to identify their physiological basis.",Sino-orbital desmoid tumor in a pediatric patient - Case report with review of literature.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30587044,"Orbit (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",2018 12 27,"We report a case of a 2-year-old female who presented with bilateral progressive proptosis, visual loss, nasal obstruction, and breathing difficulty. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a large sino-orbital mass that was extending to the orbital apex and skull base. An initial diagnosis of rhabdomyosarcoma was made elsewhere on the basis of the presence of round and spindle cell tumor. Subsequent biopsy with immunohistochemical staining was positive for nuclear staining with β-catenin, shifting the diagnosis to a myofibroblastic tumor, favoring desmoid-type fibromatosis. With image guidance, near complete excision of tumor was performed by a multidisciplinary team, while respecting danger zones such as the skull base and the optic nerve. Following a recurrence over 2 months, additional excision was performed with a 6-month treatment of methotrexate and vinblastine. Desmoid tumor is a rare form of soft tissue tumor uncommonly seen in the orbital area. Although benign, it is known to be recurrent and infiltrative. Few data are known and further information will aid in the management of these tumors.","A daily diary study of internalised weight bias and its psychological, eating and exercise correlates.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30587043,Psychology & health,2019 04 22,"The current investigation extends ecological momentary assessment (EMA) and daily diary weight stigma research in internalised weight bias (IWB).

This results in poorer holistic outcomes, compared to patients without dementia, and an increased cost for the healthcare sector and, society as a whole. The quest is to make hospitals a dementia-friendly context, because this is likely to lead to better patient outcomes for people with dementia generally; however, further research is required to understand where gains may be made in this regard. This study conducted participant observation research strategies to follow patient journeys with Alzheimer's disease admitted to orthopaedic wards, to learn about their experiences as patients. Longitudinal data were gathered by following patients on both day and evening shifts within a specialist orthopaedic hospital ward, commencing at patient admission and concluding at time of discharge. The data were interpreted from a phenomenological-hermeneutic perspective, inspired by Ricoeur's interpretation theory. The study revealed a communication style among nurses who failed to take into account the comprehensive needs of patients with dementia, in terms of timely information exchange and clinical relevance. Patients expressed the desire to be more fully engaged in the care decision-making, together with indicating their appreciation of the work of the health professionals who cared for them. The data revealed that the process of getting to know the patient at the beginning of every shift left little room to alleviate patients' experienced distress, caused by being in hospital. This resulted in patients who were less involved in the caring situation, or, if a patient took the initiative to act, intentions ended up being misinterpreted as disruptive behaviour. The findings have relevance for staff and ward management who are interested to strive to enhance the patient journey as a dementia-friendly hospital.",Clinical Utility of Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System Domain Scales.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30587028,Circulation.

In the United States alone, incidence of age-related diseases (e.g., cardiovascular disease, stroke, Alzheimer's disease, vascular cognitive impairment and dementia, cancer, hypertension, type-2 diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and osteoarthritis) is on the rise, posing an unsustainable socioeconomic burden even for the most developed countries. Tackling each and every age-related disease alone is proving to be costly and ineffective. The emerging field of geroscience has posed itself as an interdisciplinary approach that aims to understand the relationship between the biology of aging and the pathophysiology of chronic age-related diseases. According to the geroscience concept, aging is the single major risk factor that underlies several age-related chronic diseases, and manipulation of cellular and systemic aging processes can delay the manifestation and/or severity of these age-related chronic pathologies. The goal of this endeavor is to achieve health improvements by preventing/delaying the pathogenesis of several age-related diseases simultaneously in the elderly population by targeting key cellular and molecular processes of aging instead of managing diseases of aging as they arise individually. In this review, we discuss recent advances in the field of geroscience, highlighting their implications for potential future therapeutic targets and the associated scientific challenges and opportunities that lay ahead.","Energy expenditure, recovery oxygen consumption, and substrate oxidation during and after body weight resistance exercise with slow movement compared to treadmill walking.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30587026,Physiology international,2019 04 24,"The benefit of body weight resistance exercise with slow movement (BWRE-slow) for muscle function is well-documented, but not for energy metabolism. We aimed to examine physiological responses [e.g., energy expenditure (EE), respiratory exchange ratio (RER), and blood lactate (La)] during and after BWRE-slow compared to EE-matched treadmill walking (TW). Eight healthy young men (23.4 ± 1.8 years old, 171.2 ± 6.2 cm, 63.0 ± 4.8 kg) performed squat, push-up, lunge, heel-raise, hip-lift, and crunch exercises with BWRE-slow modality. Both the concentric and eccentric phases were set to 3 s. A total of three sets (10 repetitions) with 30 s rest between sets were performed for each exercise (26.5 min). On another day, subjects walked on a treadmill for 26.5 min during which EE during exercise was matched to that of BWRE-slow with the researcher controlling the treadmill speed manually. The time course changes of EE and RER were measured. The EE during exercise for BWRE-slow (92.6 ± 16.0 kcal for 26.5 min) was not significantly different from the EE during exercise for TW (95.5 ± 14.1 kcal, p = 0.36). BWRE-slow elicited greater recovery EE (40.55 ± 3.88 kcal for 30 min) than TW (37.61 ± 3.19 kcal, p = 0.029). RER was significantly higher in BWRE-slow during and 0-5 min after exercise, but became significantly lower during 25-30 min after exercise, suggesting greater lipid oxidation was induced about 30 min after exercise in BWRE-slow compared to TW.

The subjective influence of human observer and the large inter-observer and interlab differences are substantial among these tests. This necessitates the possibility of using technological innovations for behavioral science to obtain new parameters, results and insights as well. The light-dark box (LDB) test is a characteristic tool used to assess anxiety in rodents. A complete behavioral analysis (including both anxiety and locomotion parameters) is not possible by performing traditional LDB test protocol, as it lacks the usage of a real-time video recording of the test.

The cucumber, Cucumis sativus, and Phillyrea angustifolia, or false olive, were chosen as test plants. The MRI measurements were carried out on three samples of each plant in the same position vis-a-vis the MRI apparatus using a Siemens Avanto MRI scanner. Two different relaxation times were employed, T1, capable of histological mapping, and T2, used for the examination of water content. In the course of the analysis, it was found that certain histological formations and branching cause modifications to the intensity detected with relaxation time T2. Furthermore, these positions can also be found in T1 measurements. A monotonic correlation (cucumber: ρ = 0.829; false olive: ρ = -0.84) was observed between the T1 and T2 measurements. In the course of the statistical analysis of the signal intensities of the xylems it was concluded that they cannot be regarded as independent in a statistical sense; these changes rather depend on the anatomic structure of the plant, as the intensity profile is modified by nodes, leaves and branches. This serves as a demonstration of the applicability of MRI to the measurement of well know plant physiological processes. The special parametrization required for this equipment, which is usually used in human diagnostics, is also documented in the present study.",In vitro pharmacological effects of Astragalus eremophilus and Melilotus parviflora.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30587023,Acta biologica Hungarica,2019 06 13,"Traditional medicines are composed of herbal formulations and their active ingredients and constituents which play a crucial role in the treatment of various human ailments. Astragalus eremophilus and Melilotus indicus (L.) All. (syn. Melilotus parviflora Desf.) are used traditionally as antiperspirant, tonic, diuretic, laxative and narcotic agents. The current study was designed to investigate the Astragalus eremophilus and Melilotus indicus (L.) All. (syn. Melilotus parviflora Desf.) methanol extracts for their antioxidant, antibacterial and antifungal activities. Fine powder of A. eremophilus and M. parviflora was extracted with 70% methanol to get crude methanol extract. Extract was characterized for antioxidant, antibacterial and antifungal activities. Antioxidant activity of various concentrations (3 mg/ml, 1.5 mg/ ml, 0.75 mg/ml, and 0.38 mg/ml) of both plant extracts was analyzed using 2,2-Diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radical. Salmonella typhemorium, Klebsiella pneumoniae (gram-negative) and Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis (gram-positive) bacterial strains were used for assessment of antibacterial activities. Antifungal activities of 7.5 mg/ml, 5.0 mg/ml, 2.5 mg/ml (A. eremophilus and M. parviflora) were conducted using Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus fumigatus and Candida albicons. At high concentration (3 mg/ml), all the tested fractions of A. eremophilus and M. parviflora methanol extracts showed potent antioxidant activities, ranging between 83.8 and 63.33%. Antibacterial activities revealed that A. eremophilus showed a maximum zone of inhibition (8.1 ± 0.1) on Salmonella typhenorium followed by Enterococcus faecalis (7.2 ± 0.1), Klebsellesa pneumonia (6.1 ± 0.6), and Staphylococcus aureus (5.1 ± 0.4), and at highest concentration (7.5 mg/ml), however, maximum zone of inhibition of Melilotus parviflora was at 7.5 mg/ml followed by 5.0 mg/ml and 2.5 mg/ml against Klebsiella pneumonia, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella typhemorium and Enterococcus faecalis. Antifungal assessment of both plant extracts showed that the higher concentration (7.5 mg/ml) has significant inhibitory effect as compared to control. The results can lead to the conclusion that A. eremophilus and M. parviflora methanol extracts are indeed sources of potential therapeutic compounds against antibacterial, antifungal and free radical associated disorders.",Comparative toxicity evaluation of targeted anticancer therapeutics in embryonic zebrafish and sea urchin models.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30587022,Acta biologica Hungarica,2019 06 13,"Cancer drug resistance and poor selectivity towards cancer cells demand the constant search for new therapeutics. PI3K-Akt-mTOR and RAS-MAPK-ERK signaling pathways are key mechanisms involved in cell survival, proliferation, differentiation, and metabolism and their deregulation in cancer can promote development of therapy resistance. We investigated the effects of targeted inhibitors (wortmannin, GSK690693, AZD2014 and tipifarnib) towards these two pathways on early zebrafish and sea urchin development to assess their toxicity in normal, fast proliferating cells. PI3K inhibitor wortmannin and RAS inhibitor tipifarnib displayed highest toxicity while GSK690693, a pan-Akt kinase inhibitor, exhibited a less significant impact on embryo survival and development. Moreover, inhibition of the upstream part of the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway (wortmannin/GSK690693 co-treatment) produced a synergistic effect and impacted zebrafish embryo survival and development at much lower concentrations. Dual mTORC1/mTORC2 inhibitor AZD2014 showed no considerable effects on embryonic cells of zebrafish in concentrations substantially toxic in cancer cells. AZD2014 also caused the least prominent effects on sea urchin embryo development compared to other inhibitors. Significant toxicity of AZD2014 in human cancer cells, its capacity to sensitize resistant cancers, lower antiproliferative activity against human normal cell lines and fast proliferating embryonic cells could make this agent a promising candidate for anticancer therapy.","Inhibition of the formation of amyloid-like fibrils with spices, especially cloves.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30587021,Acta biologica Hungarica,2019 06 13,"During the study of inhibition of amyloid fibril formation, α-chymotrypsin protein was developed in 55% ethanol at pH 7.0.

We studied the inhibitory effect of the cloves at different concentrations on aggregation, it was found that the inhibitory activity of clove is dependent on concentration. We have measured the total phenolic content of the spice extracts too. Based on all these findings we have come to the following conclusion: Our results indicate that spices can contain other compounds too - not only phenolic compounds - which influence the formation of amyloid fibrils, and the effectiveness of various phenolic compounds are different.",Effects of drought stress on hybrids of Vigna radiata at germination stage.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30587020,Acta biologica Hungarica,2019 06 13,"Drought is one the critical abiotic factors that reduces the germination, growth and yield of crops.

Seven hybrids of V. radiata (9801, 7002, 9706, 08003, 07007, 97012 and 08007) were used for screening against three levels of drought stress (zero, control), 5% (-0.05 MPa) and 10% (-0.1 MPa) induced by Polyethyleneglycol (PEG6000). A higher proline content was observed in 07007 (6.10 μg/g fresh weight) as compared to all other hybrids. Treated seedlings of each hybrid were compared with their respective control to evaluate the differences in their growth under drought. Different parameters such as percentage of germination, germination stress tolerance index (GSI), shoot and root weights (bath fresh and dry) and lengths, root length stress index (RLSI), dry matter stress index (DMSI) and plant height stress index (PHSI) showed considerable variations. Germination percentage, shoot weights, PHSI and DMSI decreased in all hybrids along with the increase of PEG induced drought stress (5% and 10% PEG). In contrary, root weights and RLSI were increased under drought. Overall 07007 showed a better performance, and can therefore be classified as a drought tolerant hybrid."

They actively demonstrated their agency and resistance within the webs of exclusion they faced. In promoting health, nurses can best support mothers in many ways, such as by employing strengths-based nursing, challenging their own stigma and notions of 'good mothering', and by recognizing and challenging the often insurmountable barriers posed within the system for this population.",Implementation of pictorial support for communication with people who have been forced to flee: Experiences from neonatal care.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30587003,Journal of child health care : for professionals working with children in the hospital and community,2019 05 27,"A first attempt was made to introduce picture-based communication at a Swedish neonatal ward to facilitate communication with immigrant patients having fled their country of origin. Six members of staff were interviewed about their experiences using semi-structured dyadic interviews. Their answers were analysed using inductive content analysis, and the results were related to a theoretical framework called Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services. The staff found the pictures to be helpful in communication with refugees. They were motivated to use the pictorial support and experienced a great need for it. Two key prerequisites for successful implementation were identified: receiving training and having a person formally in charge of the implementation process.",Hepcidin Deficiency Protects Against Atherosclerosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30587002,"Arteriosclerosis, thrombosis, and vascular biology",2019 01 26,"Objective- Inflammatory stimuli enhance the progression of atherosclerotic disease. Inflammation also increases the expression of hepcidin, a hormonal regulator of iron homeostasis, which decreases intestinal iron absorption, reduces serum iron levels and traps iron within macrophages. The role of macrophage iron in the development of atherosclerosis remains incompletely understood. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of hepcidin deficiency and decreased macrophage iron on the development of atherosclerosis. Approach and Results- Hepcidin- and LDL (low-density lipoprotein) receptor-deficient ( Hamp-/-/ Ldlr-/-) mice and Hamp+/+/ Ldlr-/- control mice were fed a high-fat diet for 21 weeks. Compared with control mice, Hamp-/-/ Ldlr-/- mice had decreased aortic macrophage activity and atherosclerosis. Because hepcidin deficiency is associated with both increased serum iron and decreased macrophage iron, the possibility that increased serum iron was responsible for decreased atherosclerosis in Hamp-/-/ Ldlr-/- mice was considered. Hamp+/+/ Ldlr-/- mice were treated with iron dextran so as to produce a 2-fold increase in serum iron. Increased serum iron did not decrease atherosclerosis in Hamp+/+/ Ldlr-/- mice. Aortic macrophages from Hamp-/-/ Ldlr-/- mice had less labile free iron and exhibited a reduced proinflammatory (M1) phenotype compared with macrophages from Hamp+/+/ Ldlr-/- mice. THP1 human macrophages treated with an iron chelator were used to model hepcidin deficiency in vitro. Treatment with an iron chelator reduced LPS (lipopolysaccharide)-induced M1 phenotypic expression and decreased uptake of oxidized LDL. Conclusions- In summary, in a hyperlipidemic mouse model, hepcidin deficiency was associated with decreased macrophage iron, a reduced aortic macrophage inflammatory phenotype and protection from atherosclerosis. The results indicate that decreasing hepcidin activity, with the resulting decrease in macrophage iron, may prove to be a novel strategy for the treatment of atherosclerosis.",MicroRNA-21 Deficiency Alters the Survival of Ly-6Clo Monocytes in ApoE-/- Mice and Reduces Early-Stage Atherosclerosis-Brief Report.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30587001,"Arteriosclerosis, thrombosis, and vascular biology",2019 03 06,"Objective- To determine the role of microRNA-21 (miR-21) on the homeostasis of monocyte subsets and on atherosclerosis development in ApoE-/- (apolipoprotein E) mice. Approach and Results- In ApoE-/- mice, miR-21 expression was increased in circulating Ly-6Clo nonclassical monocytes in comparison to Ly-6Chi monocytes. The absence of miR-21 significantly altered the survival and number of circulating Ly-6Clo nonclassical monocytes in ApoE-/- mice. In the early stages of atherosclerosis, the absence of miR-21 limited lesion development both in the aortic sinus (by almost 30%) and in the aorta (by almost 50%). This was associated with less monocyte availability in circulation and increased apoptosis of local macrophages in plaques. At later stages of atherosclerosis, lesion size in the aortic root was similar in ApoE-/- and ApoE-/- miR-21-/- mice, but plaques showed a less stable phenotype (larger necrotic cores) in the latter. The loss of protection in advanced stages was most likely because of excessive inflammatory apoptosis related to an impairment of local efficient efferocytosis. Conclusions- Gene deletion of miR-21 in ApoE-/- mice alters Ly-6Clo nonclassical monocytes homeostasis and contribute to limit early-stage atherosclerosis.",Managing Pain in Chronically Ill Homebound Patients Through Home-Based Primary and Palliative Care.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30587000,The American journal of hospice & palliative care,2019 06 13,"Many older adults are homebound due to chronic illness and suffer from significant symptoms, including pain.

Here, the effects of temperature and ionic concentration on nanodroplet electrocoalescence are investigated by molecular dynamics simulation. The results show that low ionic concentration rapidly drives ions towards water clusters and leads to dipole polarization of droplets. With an increase of ionic concentration, the particle-particle interaction is enhanced, but the mobility of free water molecules and salt ions is curbed by hydration and ion pairs, which then slows the electrocoalescence. Low temperature accelerates the rotation of water molecules but does not enhance the mobility of ions. Alternatively, high temperature not only breaks the self-assembly of water molecules along the electric field direction but also helps ions to overcome the electrostatic barrier between particles. The latter effect promotes dipole polarization to compensate for the shortcoming of less orientation polarization. The combined effects of ion concentration and temperature are investigated and unified by droplet conductivity from the microscopic point of view. The conductivity increases with the increase in temperatures and ionic concentrations. We confirm that the accurate control of droplet electrocoalescence can be achieved by a suitable combination of temperature and ionic concentration.",Tip-Enhanced Raman Imaging of Single-Stranded DNA with Single Base Resolution.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586988,Journal of the American Chemical Society,2019 04 20,"Tip-enhanced Raman scattering (TERS) is a promising optical and analytical technique for chemical imaging and sensing at single molecule resolution. In particular, TERS signals generated by a gap-mode configuration where a silver tip is coupled with a gold substrate can resolve a single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) molecule with a spatial resolution below 1 nm. To demonstrate the proof of subnanometer resolution, we show direct nucleic acid sequencing using TERS of a phage ssDNA (M13mp18). M13mp18 provides a known sequence and, through our deposition strategy, can be stretched (uncoiled) and attached to the substrate by its phosphate groups, while exposing its nucleobases to the tip. After deposition, we scan the silver tip along the ssDNA and collect TERS signals with a step of 0.5 nm, comparable to the bond length between two adjacent DNA bases. By demonstrating the real-time profiling of a ssDNA configuration and furthermore, with unique TERS signals of monomeric units of other biopolymers, we anticipate that this technique can be extended to the high-resolution imaging of various nanostructures as well as the direct sequencing of other important biopolymers including RNA, polysaccharides, and polypeptides.",The condition of mineralized tooth tissue of the inhabitants of Szackie Lake District (Ukraine) with regard to the content of silver and chosen microelements in drinking water and the soil.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586987,Annals of agricultural and environmental medicine : AAEM,2019 01 11,"The aim of the study is to evaluate the mineralization tooth tissues in the inhabitants of Melniki village Szackie, Lake District, Ukraine, with regard to silver content and chosen macro-elements in the soil, tap water, and the water in Pisoczno Lake located in the vicinity of village.",Disrupted iron metabolism in peritoneal fluid may induce oxidative stress in the peritoneal cavity of women with endometriosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586986,Annals of agricultural and environmental medicine : AAEM,2019 01 11,Data on the possible role of peritoneal fluid free radical-mediated oxidative damage in the pathogenesis of endometriosis still remains inconsistent.

Elastase, cathepsin K and plasmin activity increased in the heart muscles of T0h and T3h versus Tpre. No aortic differences were observed. Thus, a single bout of physical effort elicited different responses in tissues of T versus UT rats. Increased proteolytic enzyme levels in muscles could influence tissue remodeling.

The partition coefficients log Pow of main constitutive flavonolignans, taxifolin and their respective dehydro derivatives were determined by a High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) method and by mathematical (in silico) approaches in n-octanol/water and model lipid membranes. These parameters were compared with human skin intake ex vivo. The experimental log Pow values for individual diastereomers were estimated for the first time. The replacement of n-octanol with model lipid membranes in the theoretical lipophilicity estimation improved the prediction strength. During transdermal transport, all the studied compounds permeated the human skin ex vivo; none of them reached the acceptor liquid. Both experimental/theoretical tools allowed the studied polyphenols to be divided into two groups: low (taxifolin, silychristin, silydianin) vs. high (silybin, dehydrosilybin, isosilybin) lipophilicity and skin intake. In silico predictions can be usefully applied for estimating general lipophilicity trends, such as skin penetration or accumulation predictions.

Studies have reported that MLN4924, a NEDD8-activating enzyme inhibitor, achieves antitumor effects against numerous malignancies. In this study, the suppressive effects of MLN4924 on human chondrosarcoma cell lines were investigated using in vitro and in vivo assays, which involved measuring cell viability, cytotoxicity, apoptosis, proliferation, cell cycles, molecule-associated cell cycles, apoptosis, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and tumor growth in a xenograft mouse model. Our results demonstrated that MLN4924 significantly suppressed cell viability, exhibited cytotoxicity, and stimulated apoptosis through the activation of caspase-3 and caspase-7 in chondrosarcoma cell lines. Furthermore, MLN4924 significantly inhibited cell proliferation by diminishing the phosphorylation of histone H3 to cause G2/M cell cycle arrest. In addition, MLN4924 activated ER stress⁻related apoptosis by upregulating the phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), enhancing the expression of GRP78 and CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP, an inducer of endoplasmic ER stress⁻related apoptosis) and activating the cleavage of caspase-4. Moreover, MLN4924 considerably inhibited the growth of chondrosarcoma tumors in a xenograft mouse model. Finally, MLN4924-mediated antichondrosarcoma properties can be accompanied by the stimulation of ER stress⁻related apoptosis, implying that targeting neddylation by MLN4924 is a novel therapeutic strategy for treating chondrosarcoma.",Anticorrosion Behavior of Zeolite Coatings Obtained by In Situ Crystallization: A Critical Review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586947,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 01 23,"Zeolites are crystalline nanoporous aluminosilicates.

Regarding donor site morbidity, autologous transplantation shows great limitations, which urge the need for alternative options in nerve reconstruction. Spider silk was reported as an advantageous material for cell adhesion, migration and proliferation, and its use in conduits is of great interest, especially in combination with cells to improve nerve regeneration. We here described the behavior of a co-culture of human Schwann cells and human adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) on spider silk as a new approach. After characterized by immunostaining ADSCs and Schwann cells were seeded in the co-culture on a spider silk scaffold and observed for 21 days. Results showed that cells were attached to the silk and aligned along the silk fibers. With further culture time, cells migrated along the silk and increased in number and formed an almost confluent cell layer. In immunostaining, results suggest that the cell layer was equally composed of ADSCs and Schwann cells.

Using the keywords ""Eutrophic Reservoir"" and ""Urban"" and selecting all the years of open publication on the Science web page, we obtained 69 results, 53 of them meeting the requirements established for the search. Many of the studies mention as the most important determinant for eutrophication of reservoirs and the proliferation of algae, the anthropogenic influence through the diffuse load of streets, domestic and industrial sewage, and even drainage water from agricultural areas in the basin. The results of this study reinforce that informal settlements without sanitary infrastructure are aggravating the deterioration of water quality in urban water sources and therefore posing many risks to public health.",Research Advances and Prospects on Mechanism of Sinomenin on Histamine Release and the Binding to Histamine Receptors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586944,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 04 03,"Sinomenine (SIN) is widely used in China to treat a variety of rheumatic diseases (RA), and has various pharmacological effects such as anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and anti-tumor effects. However, due to the histamine release characteristics of SIN, its adverse reactions such as allergic reactions, gastrointestinal reactions, and circulatory systemic reactions have been drawing increasing attention. We present here a systematic review of the chemical structure, pharmacological effects, clinical application, and adverse reactions of SIN, a detailed discussion on the relationship between histamine/histamine receptor and mechanism of action of SIN. In addition, we simulated the binding of SIN to four histamine receptors by using a virtual molecular docking method and found that the bonding intensity between SIN and receptors varied in the order shown as follows: H1R > H2R ~ H3R > H4R. The docking results suggested that SIN might exhibit dual regulatory effects in many processes such as cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression, NF-κB pathway activation, and degranulation of mast cells to release histamine, thereby exhibiting pro-inflammatory (adverse reactions)/anti-inflammatory effects. This study provides a theoretical basis for the clinical treatment of inflammations seen such as in RA using SIN, and also suggests that SIN has great potential in the field of cancer treatment and will have very important social and economic significance.",The Chromatin Remodeler LET-418/Mi2 is Required Cell Non-Autonomously for the Post-Embryonic Development of Caenorhabditis elegans.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586943,Journal of developmental biology,2019 05 01,"Chromatin condition is crucial for the cells to respond to their environment. In C. elegans, post-embryonic development is accompanied by the exit of progenitor cells from quiescence in response to food. The chromatin protein LET-418/Mi2 is required for this transition in development indicating that proper chromatin structure in cells of the freshly hatched larvae is important to respond to food. However, the identity of the tissue or cells where LET-418/Mi2 is required, as well as the developmental signals that it is modulating have not been elucidated. By restoring the activity of LET-418/Mi2 in specific tissues, we demonstrate that its activity in the intestine and the hypodermis is able to promote in a cell non-autonomous manner the exit of blast cells from quiescence and further development. Furthermore, we identify the IIS (insulin/insulin-like growth factor signaling) pathway to be one of the signaling pathways that is conveying LET-418/Mi2 cell non-autonomous effect on development.",Wave Propagation of Porous Nanoshells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586942,"Nanomaterials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 02 07,"This study aims at investigating the wave propagation of porous nanoshells. The Bi-Helmholtz non-local strain gradient theory is employed in conjunction with a higher-order shear deformation shell theory, in order to include the size-dependent effects. The nanoshells are made of a porous functionally graded material (P-FGM), whose properties vary continuously along the thickness direction. A variational approach is here applied to handle the governing equations of the problem, which are solved analytically to compute the wave frequencies and phase velocities as function of the wave numbers. The sensitivity of the wave response is analyzed for a varying porosity volume fraction, material properties, non-local parameters, strain gradient length scales, temperature, humidity, and wave numbers. Based on the results, it is verified that the size-dependence of the response is almost the same to the one of plates, beams and tubes.",Microfluidic Long-Term Gradient Generator with Axon Separation Prototyped by 185 nm Diffused Light Photolithography of SU-8 Photoresist.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586941,Micromachines,2019 02 06,"We have developed a cast microfluidic chip for concentration gradient generation that contains a thin (~5 µm² cross-sectional area) microchannel. The diffusion of diffused 185 nm ultraviolet (UV) light from an inexpensive low-pressure mercury lamp exposed a layer of the SU-8 photoresist from the backside and successfully patterned durable 2 µm-high microchannel mold features with smooth bell-shaped sidewalls. The thin channel had appropriate flow resistance and simultaneously satisfied both the rapid introduction of test substance and long-term maintenance of gradients. The average height and width at the half height of the channel, defined by a 2 µm-wide line mask pattern, were 2.00 ± 0.19 µm, and 2.14 ± 0.89 µm, respectively. We were able to maintain the concentration gradient of Alexa Fluor 488 fluorescent dye inside or at the exit of the thin microchannel in an H-shaped microfluidic configuration for at least 48 h. We also demonstrated the cultivation of chick embryo dorsal root ganglion neuronal cells for 96 h, and the directional elongation of axons under a nerve growth factor concentration gradient.",Thermococcus Eurythermalis Endonuclease IV Can Cleave Various Apurinic/Apyrimidinic Site Analogues in ssDNA and dsDNA.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586940,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 04 03,"Endonuclease IV (EndoIV) is a DNA damage-specific endonuclease that mainly hydrolyzes the phosphodiester bond located at 5' of an apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) site in DNA. EndoIV also possesses 3'-exonuclease activity for removing 3'-blocking groups and normal nucleotides. Here, we report that Thermococcus eurythermalis EndoIV (TeuendoIV) shows AP endonuclease and 3'-exonuclease activities. The effect of AP site structures, positions and clustered patterns on the activity was characterized. The AP endonuclease activity of TeuendoIV can incise DNA 5' to various AP site analogues, including the alkane chain Spacer and polyethylene glycol Spacer. However, the short Spacer C2 strongly inhibits the AP endonuclease activity. The kinetic parameters also support its preference to various AP site analogues. In addition, the efficient cleavage at AP sites requires ≥2 normal nucleotides existing at the 5'-terminus. The 3'-exonuclease activity of TeuendoIV can remove one or more consecutive AP sites at the 3'-terminus. Mutations on the residues for substrate recognition show that binding AP site-containing or complementary strand plays a key role for the hydrolysis of phosphodiester bonds. Our results provide a comprehensive biochemical characterization of the cleavage/removal of AP site analogues and some insight for repairing AP sites in hyperthermophile cells."

Due to the comparative mosquitocidal efficacy on these mosquitoes, this plant essential oil is promoted as an attractive candidate for further study in monitoring resistance of mosquito vectors. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of P. crispum essential oil on the biochemical characteristics of the target mosquito larvae of Ae. aegypti, by determining quantitative changes of key enzymes responsible for xenobiotic detoxification, including glutathione-S-transferases (GSTs), α- and β-esterases (α-/β-ESTs), acetylcholinesterase (AChE), acid and alkaline phosphatases (ACP and ALP) and mixed-function oxidases (MFO). Three populations of Ae. aegypti, comprising the pyrethroid susceptible Muang Chiang Mai-susceptible (MCM-S) strain and the pyrethroid resistant Pang Mai Dang-resistant (PMD-R) and Upakut-resistant (UPK-R) strains, were used as test organisms. Biochemical study of Ae. aegypti larvae prior to treatment with P. crispum essential oil revealed that apart from AChE, the baseline activity of most defensive enzymes, such as GSTs, α-/β-ESTs, ACP, ALP and MFO, in resistant UPK-R or PMD-R, was higher than that determined in susceptible MCM-S. However, after 24-h exposure to P. crispum essential oil, the pyrethroid susceptible and resistant Ae. aegypti showed similarity in biochemical features, with alterations of enzyme activity in the treated larvae, as compared to the controls. An increase in the activity levels of GSTs, α-/β-ESTs, ACP and ALP was recorded in all strains of P. crispum oil-treated Ae. aegypti larvae, whereas MFO and AChE activity in these mosquitoes was decreased. The recognizable larvicidal capability on pyrethroid resistant Ae. aegypti, and the inhibitory effect on AChE and MFO, emphasized the potential of P. crispum essential oil as an attractive alternative application for management of mosquito resistance in current and future control programs.",Patterns of Drought Response of 38 WRKY Transcription Factors of Zanthoxylum bungeanum Maxim.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586928,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 04 03,"The WRKY family of transcription factors (TFs) includes a number of transcription-specific groupings that play important roles in plant growth and development and in plant responses to various stresses. To screen for WRKY transcription factors associated with drought stress in Zanthoxylum bungeanum, a total of 38 ZbWRKY were identified and these were then classified and identified with Arabidopsis WRKY. Using bioinformatics analyses based on the structural characteristics of the conservative domain, 38 WRKY transcription factors were identified and categorized into three groups: Groups I, II, and III. Of these, Group II can be divided into four subgroups: subgroups IIb, IIc, IId, and IIe. No ZbWRKY members of subgroup IIa were found in the sequencing data. In addition, 38 ZbWRKY were identified by real-time PCR to determine the behavior of this family of genes under drought stress. Twelve ZbWRKY transcription factors were found to be significantly upregulated under drought stress and these were identified by relative quantification. As predicted by the STRING website, the results show that the WRKYs are involved in four signaling pathways-the jasmonic acid (JA), the salicylic acid (SA), the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and the ethylene signaling pathways. ZbWRKY33 is the most intense transcription factor in response to drought stress. We predict that WRKY33 binds directly to the ethylene synthesis precursor gene ACS6, to promote ethylene synthesis. Ethylene then binds to the ethylene activator release signal to activate a series of downstream genes for cold stress and osmotic responses. The roles of ZbWRKY transcription factors in drought stress rely on a regulatory network center on the JA signaling pathway.",Survey of Deoxynivalenol Contamination in Agricultural Products in the Chinese Market Using An ELISA Kit.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586927,Toxins,2019 02 06,"A total of 328 agricultural product samples highly suspected to be contaminated, from flour companies, feed companies, and livestock farms throughout China, were surveyed for deoxynivalenol (DON) contamination using a self-assembly enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit. An ELISA kit for DON was developed with a 4.9 ng mL-1 limit of detection (LOD) in working buffer and a 200 ng g-1 LOD in authentic samples. The DON contamination detection rate was 88.7%, concentrations ranged from 200.9 to 6480.6 ng g-1, and the highest DON contamination was found in distillers' dried grains with solubles with an average of 3204.5 ng g-1. Wheat bran and wheat were found to be the most commonly contaminated samples, and the corn meal samples had the lowest average DON level. This ELISA kit is a powerful alternative method for the rapid, sensitive, specific, accurate, and high-throughput determination of DON and can meet the maximum requirement levels. This survey suggests that DON contamination in the Chinese market is serious, and the contamination risk deserves attention. Essential preventive measures should be implemented to ensure food safety and human health.","TRIMming down to TRIM37: Relevance to Inflammation, Cardiovascular Disorders, and Cancer in MULIBREY Nanism.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586926,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 04 03,"TRIpartite motif (TRIM) proteins are part of the largest subfamilies of E3 ligases that mediate the transfer of ubiquitin to substrate target proteins. In this review, we focus on TRIM37 in the normal cell and in pathological conditions, with an emphasis on the MULIBREY (MUscle-LIver-BRain-EYe) genetic disorder caused by TRIM37 mutations. TRIM37 is characterized by the presence of a RING domain, B-box motifs, and a coiled-coil region, and its C-terminal part includes the MATH domain specific to TRIM37. MULIBREY nanism is a rare autosomal recessive caused by TRIM37 mutations and characterized by severe pre- and postnatal growth failure. Constrictive pericarditis is the most serious anomaly of the disease and is present in about 20% of patients. The patients have a deregulation of glucose and lipid metabolism, including type 2 diabetes, fatty liver, and hypertension. Puzzlingly, MULIBREY patients, deficient for TRIM37, are plagued with numerous tumors. Among non-MULIBREY patients affected by cancer, a wide variety of cancers are associated with an overexpression of TRIM37. This suggests that normal cells need an optimal equilibrium in TRIM37 expression. Finding a way to keep that balance could lead to potential innovative drugs for MULIBREY nanism, including heart condition and carcinogenesis treatment.",OPENCRONIC Study. Knowledge and Experiences of Spanish Patients and Carers about Chronic Disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586925,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 05 28,"
Background
: Chronic diseases are currently the main cause of morbidity and mortality and represent a major challenge to healthcare systems. The objective of this study is to know Spanish public opinion about chronic disease and how it affects their daily lives. 
Methods
: Through a telephone or online survey of 24 questions, data was gathered on the characteristics of the respondents and their knowledge and experiences of chronic diseases. 
Results
: Of the 2522 survey respondents, 325 had a chronic disease and were carers, 1088 had a chronic disease and were not carers, 140 did not have a chronic disease but were carers, and 969 did not have chronic disease and were not carers. The degree of knowledge on these diseases was good or very good for 69.4%, 56.0%, 62.2%, and 46.7%, respectively, for each group. All the groups agreed that chronic diseases mainly affect mood, quality of life and having to make sacrifices. 
Conclusions
: Knowledge about chronic diseases is relatively good, although it can be improved among the Spanish population, especially among patients who report having a chronic disease and play the role of carers. However, it is important to continue maintaining the level of information and training concerning these diseases.",Glycoprotein Non-Metastatic Protein B: An Emerging Biomarker for Lysosomal Dysfunction in Macrophages.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586924,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 04 03,"Several diseases are caused by inherited defects in lysosomes, the so-called lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs). In some of these LSDs, tissue macrophages transform into prominent storage cells, as is the case in Gaucher disease. Here, macrophages become the characteristic Gaucher cells filled with lysosomes laden with glucosylceramide, because of their impaired enzymatic degradation. Biomarkers of Gaucher cells were actively searched, particularly after the development of costly therapies based on enzyme supplementation and substrate reduction. Proteins selectively expressed by storage macrophages and secreted into the circulation were identified, among which glycoprotein non-metastatic protein B (GPNMB). This review focusses on the emerging potential of GPNMB as a biomarker of stressed macrophages in LSDs as well as in acquired pathologies accompanied by an excessive lysosomal substrate load in macrophages.","A Critical Review on Selected External Physical Cues and Modulation of Cell Behavior: Magnetic Nanoparticles, Non-thermal Plasma and Lasers.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586923,Journal of functional biomaterials,2019 04 19,"Physics-based biomedical approaches have proved their importance for the advancement of medical sciences and especially in medical diagnostics and treatments. Thus, the expectations regarding development of novel promising physics-based technologies and tools are very high. This review describes the latest research advances in biomedical applications of external physical cues. We overview three distinct topics: using high-gradient magnetic fields in nanoparticle-mediated cell responses; non-thermal plasma as a novel bactericidal agent; highlights in understanding of cellular mechanisms of laser irradiation. Furthermore, we summarize the progress, challenges and opportunities in those directions. We also discuss some of the fundamental physical principles involved in the application of each cue. Considerable technological success has been achieved in those fields. However, for the successful clinical translation we have to understand the limitations of technologies. Importantly, we identify the misconceptions pervasive in the discussed fields.",Oncogenic Role of Tumor Necrosis Factor α-Induced Protein 8 (TNFAIP8).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586922,Cells,2019 03 06,"Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α-induced protein 8 (TNFAIP8) is a founding member of the TIPE family, which also includes TNFAIP8-like 1 (TIPE1), TNFAIP8-like 2 (TIPE2), and TNFAIP8-like 3 (TIPE3) proteins. Expression of TNFAIP8 is strongly associated with the development of various cancers including cancer of the prostate, liver, lung, breast, colon, esophagus, ovary, cervix, pancreas, and others. In human cancers, TNFAIP8 promotes cell proliferation, invasion, metastasis, drug resistance, autophagy, and tumorigenesis by inhibition of cell apoptosis. In order to better understand the molecular aspects, biological functions, and potential roles of TNFAIP8 in carcinogenesis, in this review, we focused on the expression, regulation, structural aspects, modifications/interactions, and oncogenic role of TNFAIP8 proteins in human cancers.",Modified Singular Spectrum Decomposition and Its Application to Composite Fault Diagnosis of Gearboxes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586921,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 01 24,"Under the strong noise environment, the composite fault signal of gearbox is weak, which makes it difficult to extract fault features. For this problem, based on noise-assisted method, we propose a novel method called Modified Singular Spectrum Decomposition (MSSD). Singular Spectrum Decomposition (SSD) has many advantages such as high decomposition precision and strong ability to restrain mode mixing, etc. However, the ability of SSD to extract a weak signal is not ideal, the decomposition results usually contain a lot of redundant noise and mode mixing caused by intermittency, which is also a troubling problem. In order to improve the decomposition efficiency and make up for the defects of SSD, the new method MSSD adds an adaptive and particular noise in every SSD decomposition stage for each trial, and in addition, whenever the input signal is decomposed to obtain an intrinsic module function (IMF), a unique residual is obtained. After multiple decomposition, the average value of the residual is used as input to the next stage, until the residual cannot continue to decompose, which means that the residual component has, at most, one extreme value. Finally, analyzing simulated signals to explain the advantages of MSSD compared to ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) and complete ensemble local mean decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN). In order to further prove the effectiveness of MSSD, this new method, MSSD, is applied to the fault diagnosis of an engineering gearbox test stand in an actual engineer project case. The final results show that MSSD can extract more fault feature information, and mode mixing has been improved and suffers less interference compared to SSD.",Feature Extraction of Shoulder Joint's Voluntary Flexion-Extension Movement Based on Electroencephalography Signals for Power Assistance.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586920,"Bioengineering (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 21,"Brain-Machine Interface (BMI) has been considered as an effective way to help and support both the disabled rehabilitation and healthy individuals' daily lives to use their brain activity information instead of their bodies. In order to reduce costs and control exoskeleton robots better, we aim to estimate the necessary torque information for a subject from his/her electroencephalography (EEG) signals when using an exoskeleton robot to perform the power assistance of the upper limb without using external torque sensors nor electromyography (EMG) sensors. In this paper, we focus on extracting the motion-relevant EEG signals' features of the shoulder joint, which is the most complex joint in the human's body, to construct a power assistance system using wearable upper limb exoskeleton robots with BMI technology. We extract the characteristic EEG signals when the shoulder joint is doing flexion and extension movement freely which are the main motions of the shoulder joint needed to be assisted. Independent component analysis (ICA) is used to extract the source information of neural components, and then the average method is used to extract the characteristic signals that are fundamental to achieve the control. The proposed approach has been experimentally verified. The results show that EEG signals begin to increase at 300⁻400 ms before the motion and then decrease at the beginning of the generation of EMG signals, and the peaks appear at about one second after the motion. At the same time, we also confirmed the relationship between the change of EMG signals and the EEG signals on the time dimension, and these results also provide a theoretical basis for the delay parameter in the linear model which will be used to estimate the necessary torque information in future. Our results suggest that the estimation of torque information based on EEG signals is feasible, and demonstrate the potential of using EEG signals via the control of brain-machine interface to support human activities continuously."

The solutions of the Schrödinger equation for the coupled system have been derived using the unitary transformation approach. The analytic formula of the wave functions has been obtained by applying the adiabatic condition for time evolution of the coupling parameter. The behavior of the quantum wave functions has been analyzed for several different values of parameters. The probability densities depicted in the plane of the two resonator coordinates are distorted and rotated due to the coupling between the resonators.

Here, we describe the synthesis of suitable triblock degradable poly(ethylene glycol)-poly(lactide) (PEG-PLLA) cross-linker to improve the resorption capacity of such composites. A study with four different formulations was established. As reference, pure hydroxyapatite (HA) cements and composites with 40 wt% HEMA in the liquid cement phase were produced. Furthermore, HEMA was modified with 10 wt% of PEG-PLLA cross-linker or a test series containing only 25% cross-linker was chosen for composites with a fully degradable polymeric phase. Hence, we developed suitable systems with increased elasticity and 5⁻6 times higher toughness values in comparison to pure inorganic cement matrix. Furthermore, conversion rate from α-tricalcium phosphate (α-TCP) to HA was still about 90% for all composite formulations, whereas crystal size decreased.

Two major DDT pathways exist: error-prone translesion synthesis (TLS) and error-free template switching (TS). TLS recruits low-fidelity DNA polymerases to directly replicate across the damaged template, whereas TS uses the nascent sister chromatid as a template for bypass. Both pathways must be tightly controlled to prevent the accumulation of mutations that can occur from the dysregulation of DDT proteins. A key regulator of error-prone versus error-free DDT is the replication clamp, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). Post-translational modifications (PTMs) of PCNA, mainly by ubiquitin and SUMO (small ubiquitin-like modifier), play a critical role in DDT. In this review, we will discuss the different types of PTMs of PCNA and how they regulate DDT in response to replication stress. We will also cover the roles of PCNA PTMs in lagging strand synthesis, meiotic recombination, as well as somatic hypermutation and class switch recombination.",Action towards Universal Health Coverage and Social Protection for Tuberculosis Care and Prevention: Workshop on the End TB Strategy Pillar 2 in the Western Pacific Region 2017.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586903,Tropical medicine and infectious disease,2019 04 30,"Although the End TB Strategy highlights that major global progress towards universal health coverage (UHC) and social protection are fundamental to achieving the global targets for reductions in tuberculosis (TB) incidence and deaths, there is still a long way to go to achieve them in low- and middle-income countries. A workshop on the End TB Strategy Pillar 2 in the Western Pacific Region focusing on action towards UHC and social protection was held between 27 and 29 November in 2017 at the Korean Institute of Tuberculosis in Cheonju, Republic of Korea. The workshop brought together key personnel from national TB programmes and other stakeholders or researchers with experience in this topic from six countries with a high burden of TB in the region. During the workshop, participants shared country experiences, best practices, and challenges in achieving UHC and enhancing social protection in the context of TB service delivery, and also explored policy options to address the challenges, to be applied in their respective countries.

Silica hybrid aerogel microparticles with embedded nanotubes were obtained using a two-stage sol⁻gel method with a gelling process in an oil-emulsion. Alginate hybrid aerogels with embedded nanotubes were obtained using cross-linking reactions. The following methods were used to measure the structural characteristics of obtained materials: nitrogen adsorption porosimetry, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and others. It is shown that specific surface area and pore volume increase with the increase of CNT content in silica aerogel microparticles. Obtained aerogels were tested as adsorbents for argon⁻oxygen separation. The alginate hybrid aerogel with 30 wt.% CNT content has the best argon adsorption selectivity.",Convenient Synthesis of Functionalized Cyclopropa[c]coumarin-1a-carboxylates.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586901,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 02 25,"A simple method has been developed for the synthesis of cyclopropa[c]coumarins, which belong to the donor-acceptor cyclopropane family and, therefore, are promising substrates for the preparation of chromene-based fine chemicals.

The gold standard therapeutic strategies are stomach interposition or autografts derived from the jejunum and colon. However, severe adverse reactions, such as esophageal leakage, stenosis and infection, accompany the above treatments, which, most times, are life threating. The aim of this study was the optimization of a decellularization protocol in order to develop a proper esophageal tissue engineered construct. Methods: Rat esophagi were obtained from animals and were decellularized. The decellularization process involved the use of 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl) dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate (CHAPS) and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) buffers for 6 h each, followed by incubation in a serum medium. The whole process involved two decellularization cycles. Then, a histological analysis was performed. In addition, the amounts of collagen, sulphated glycosaminoglycans and DNA content were quantified. Results: The histological analysis revealed that only the first decellularization cycle was enough to produce a cellular and nuclei free esophageal scaffold with a proper extracellular matrix orientation. These results were further confirmed by biochemical quantification. Conclusions: Based on the above results, the current decellularization protocol can be applied successfully in order to produce an esophageal tissue engineered construct."

The NSMR using FRP was the subject of numerous studies of which a mere portion was dedicated to the long-term behavior under fatigue loading. Accordingly, the present study intends to examine the fatigue performance of the NSMR applying the anchoring system developed by Korea Institute of Construction and Building Technology (KICT). To that goal, fatigue test is performed on 6.4 m reinforced concrete beams fabricated with various concrete strengths and developed lengths of the Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer (CFRP) tendon. The test results reveal that the difference in the concrete strength and in the developed length of the CFRP tendon has insignificant effect on the strengthening performance. It is concluded that the accumulation of fatigue loading, the concrete strength and the developed length of the tendon will not affect significantly the strengthening performance given that sufficient strengthening is secured.",Sociodemographic Predictors of Physical Functioning in the Elderly: A National Health Survey.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586888,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 05 28,"We aimed to evaluate the prevalence of sociodemographic factors with the presence and different degrees of walking difficulties in elderly above 65 years, and to analyze association between evaluated variables and the presence and degree of waking difficulties. In the population based study, 3540 individuals age above 65 years from Serbia were recruited. Further predictors were analyzed: gender, age, level of education, marital status, body mass index (BMI), index of well-being and place of residence. We assessed difficulty in walking half a km on level ground without the use of any aid (Group-1); and difficulty in walking up or down 12 steps (Group-2). Walking difficulties were categorized as no difficulty, some difficulty, a lot of difficulty and cannot do at all. For present difficulty significant predictors were: age (Group-1 (OR-3.022)/Group-2 (OR-3.825)), gender (Group-1 (OR-0.337)/Group-2 (OR-0.311)), educational level (Group-1 (OR-0.689)/Group-2 (OR-0.556)) and place of residence (Group-2 (OR-1.523)) while for non-performing the task, significant predictors were: age (Group-1 (OR-1.998)/Group-2 (OR-2.096)), gender (Group-1 (OR-0.629)/Group-2 (OR-0.495)), BMI (Group-1 (OR-1.219)/Group-2 (OR-1.305)), marital status (Group-1 (OR 0.764)/Group-2 (OR-0.769)), educational level (Group-1 (OR-0.679)/Group-2 (OR-0.719)) and index of well-being (Group-2 (OR-0.764)).

It is a significant global health problem as the incidence of this disorder is increasing worldwide. The causes are still poorly understood, although it certainly has genetic and environmental origins. Vitamin D formed profusely in the skin upon exposure to sunlight, as well as from dietary sources, exhibits an immunomodulatory effect based on gene transcription control. Indeed, vitamin D can downregulate mechanisms connected with adaptive immunity, induce immunological tolerance and decrease auto-aggression-related inflammation. These properties provide the basis for a preventive and therapeutic role of vitamin D. As many studies have demonstrated, appropriate supplementation with vitamin D reduces the risk of autoimmune diseases, including type 1 diabetes mellitus, and alleviates disease symptoms in patients. The aim of this narrative review is to present the molecular mechanisms for the vitamin D immunomodulatory effect as well as review human clinical studies on the use of vitamin D as adjuvant therapy in type 1 diabetes mellitus.","Outdoor Air Emissions, Land Use, and Land Cover around Schools on Tribal Lands.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586886,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 05 28,"Children from tribes are more burdened with adverse respiratory well-being outcomes versus other U.S. children. The objectives of this study were to identify stressors from the built and natural environments for tribal school-aged children. Outdoor air concentrations around U.S. tribal schools were linked to National Emission Inventories; ecoregions and National Land Cover Database; and American Community Survey and school map layers. Nine school sites (seven tribes, five U.S. states) were in three ecoregions: North American Deserts, Northern Forests, and Mediterranean California. Closest emission sources were oil, gas, airport, and manufacturing facilities. Maximum annual outdoor air concentrations were measured for toluene at two schools (29 ppb and 15 ppb, 2011), located four miles from a solid waste landfill and eight miles from paperboard/saw mills. Maximum annual concentrations of metals in particulate matter 10 micrometers and smaller were highest for manganese (68 ng/m³, 2011). Schools were in mainly arid and heavily forested lands. Closest emission sources were predominantly off tribal lands. Measurements were limited (<30/year). Compared to schools off tribal lands, schools on tribal lands were further away from roadway sources. Future research may examine outdoor air quality around schools with more developed land and indoor air for tribal children's total exposure.",Coordinative Motion-Based Bilateral Rehabilitation Training System with Exoskeleton and Haptic Devices for Biomedical Application.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586885,Micromachines,2019 02 06,"According to the neuro-rehabilitation theory, compared with unilateral training, bilateral training is proven to be an effective method for hemiparesis, which affects the most part of stroke patients. In this study, a novel bilateral rehabilitation training system, which incorporates a lightweight exoskeleton device worn on the affected limb; a haptic device (Phantom Premium), which is used for generating a desired tactile feedback for the affected limb; and a VR (virtual reality) graphic interface, has been developed. The use of VR technology during rehabilitation can provide goal directed tasks with rewards and motivate the patient to undertake extended rehabilitation. This paper is mainly focused on elbow joint training, and other independent joints can be trained by easily changing the VR training interface. The haptic device is adopted to enable patients to use their own decision making abilities with a tactical feedback. Integrated with a VR-based graphic interface, the goal-oriented task can help to gradually recovery their motor function with a coordinative motion between two limbs. In particular, the proposed system can accelerate neural plasticity and motor recovery in those patients with little muscle strength by using the exoskeleton device. The exoskeleton device can provide from relatively high joint impedance to near-zero impedance, and can provide a partial assist as the patient requires.",Readiness of Polish Nurses for Prescribing and the Level of Professional Burnout.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586884,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 05 28,"Those in the medical profession, due to close contact and the emotional commitment of caring for patients, are particularly vulnerable to the occurrence of a phenomenon known as occupational 'burnout'. The presented work deals with the problem of burnout and its relationship with new tasks undertaken by nurses. The aim of the study was an analysis of the relationship between the level of professional burnout of the nurses examined and their readiness to take on new duties related to writing prescriptions. The study was conducted among primary health care (PHC) and outpatient specialist care (OSC) nurses. The author's questionnaire and the standardized Link Burnout Questionnaire (LBQ) were used. The highest level of occupational burnout was related to psychophysical exhaustion (16.00 ± 6.21). Higher results of occupational burnout among the nurses surveyed were matched by the lower readiness of the nurses to administer medicines and write prescriptions.",Is Meat of Breeder Turkeys so Different from That of Standard Turkeys?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586883,"Foods (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 02 03,"The technological, nutritional, and sensorial quality of breasts and thighs with drumsticks of turkey male and female breeders was characterized by comparison with breasts and thighs with drumsticks of growing male and female turkeys from the Grademaker line (hybrid turkeys, n = 20 birds per sex and per physiological stage). The breeder turkeys were slaughtered at 397 and 410 days of age and 10.42 and 32.67 kg of body weight for the females and males, respectively. The standard turkeys were slaughtered at 75 and 103 days of age and 5.89 and 13.48 kg of body weight for the females and males, respectively. The differences observed between males and females on one hand and between standard and breeder turkeys on the other hand were mainly induced by differences in slaughter ages and sexual dimorphism on body weight. The meat of female breeders had characteristics close to those of female and male standard turkeys, whereas the meat of male breeders was clearly distinguishable, particularly by displaying lower tenderness and water holding capacity.",Hand Gesture Recognition in Automotive Human⁻Machine Interaction Using Depth Cameras.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586882,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 01 24,"In this review, we describe current Machine Learning approaches to hand gesture recognition with depth data from time-of-flight sensors.

However, deformation of the overhang during the fabrication process and post treatment is still a common problem. In this paper, the effect of the scanning route on the residual stress and deformation of fabricated AlSi10Mg overhang specimens by SLM was investigated. Different scanning routes for the overhang including longitudinal direction, transverse direction, and the alternation between these two scanning routes in consecutive layers were studied by experiments within this study. Numerical simulation was utilized to measure the stress of the specimens while deformation prediction was used for the different scanning routes. Both the experimental and simulated results showed that the scanning route had a substantial influence on the residual stress and deformation of the specimens. The longitudinal scanning resulted in significant upward bending deformation of the overhang as it was cut from the baseplate. However, there was less deformation for the overhangs fabricated by transverse and alternating scanning routes. A transverse scanning route is helpful for the reduction of residual stress in the longitudinal direction and the corresponding deformation.",Interplay between Nutrition and Hearing Loss: State of Art.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586880,Nutrients,2019 02 15,"Hearing loss has been recently ranked as the fifth leading cause of years lived with disability, ahead of many other chronic diseases such as diabetes, dementia, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Moreover, according to the World Health Organization, moderate-to-profound hearing loss affects about 466 million people worldwide. Its incidence varies in each population segment, affecting approximately 10% of children and increasing to 30% of the population over 65 years. However, hearing loss receives still very limited research funding and public awareness. This sensory impairment is caused by genetic and environmental factors, and among the latter, the nutritional status has acquired relevance due its association to hearing loss detected in recent epidemiological studies. Several experimental models have proved that the onset and progression of hearing loss are closely linked to the availability of nutrients and their metabolism. Here, we have reviewed studies focused on nutrient effects on auditory function. These studies support the potential of nutritional therapy for the protection against hearing loss progression, which is especially relevant to the aging process and related quality of life."

To investigate the molecular mechanisms responsible for such an effect, we compared two cytotoxic treatments able to induce the viral lytic cycle, named 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) (T) in combination with sodium butyrate (B) and bortezomib (BZ), with two cytotoxic treatments that did not activate this process, named metformin (MET) and quercetin (Q). Our results indicated that TB and bortezomib increased levels of oxygen reactive species (ROS) while metformin and quercetin reduced them. The finding that N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a reactive oxigen species (ROS) scavenger, counteracted K-bZIP expression induced by TB or bortezomib, confirmed that an ROS increase played a role in KSHV lytic cycle activation. Moreover, we found that TB and bortezomib up-regulated p62/Sequestosome1(p62/SQSTM1) protein, while metformin and quercetin down-regulated it. p62/SQSTM1 silencing or the inhibition of NF-E2-related factor 2 (NRF2) or Heat Shock Factor 1 (HSF1), that mediate p62/SQSTM1 transcription, also reduced KSHV lytic antigen expression induced by TB or bortezomib. Interestingly, such combination treatments further increased intracellular ROS and cytotoxicity induced by the single TB or bortezomib treatment, suggesting that NRF2, HSF1 and p62/SQSTM1 keep the ROS level under control, allowing primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) cells to continue to survive and KSHV to replicate.",Global Availability of Antivenoms: The Relevance of Public Manufacturing Laboratories.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586868,Toxins,2019 02 06,"Snakebite envenoming is a serious global public health problem, and international initiatives, under the coordination of the World Health Organization and its regional offices, are being developed to reduce the impact of this neglected tropical disease.

This review discusses the role of public antivenom manufacturing laboratories for ensuring the supply of antivenoms. The difficulties faced by public laboratories are discussed, together with some tasks that need to be implemented for strengthening them. In addition, the concept of 'redundancy' in the supply of antivenoms is emphasized, as a way to cope with the risks associated with the provision of antivenoms by few manufacturers. In general, the public sector should play a leading role, in antivenom availability and other aspects as well, within the global struggle to reduce the mortality and morbidity caused by snakebite envenoming.",Taste Perception and Caffeine Consumption: An fMRI Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586867,Nutrients,2019 02 15,"Caffeine is ubiquitous, yet its impact on central taste processing is not well understood. Although there has been considerable research on caffeine's physiological and cognitive effects, there is a paucity of research investigating the effects of caffeine on taste. Here we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate group differences between caffeine consumers and non-consumers in blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) activation during hedonic evaluation of taste. We scanned 14 caffeine consumers and 14 caffeine non-consumers at 3 Tesla, while they rated three tastes: caffeine (bitter), sucrose (sweet), and saccharin (sweet with bitter after taste), in aqueous solutions. Differences in BOLD activation were analyzed using voxel wise independent samples t-tests within Analysis of Functional Neuroimage (AFNI). Results indicated that during the hedonic evaluation of caffeine or sucrose, caffeine non-consumers had significantly greater activation in neuronal areas associated with memory and reward. During the hedonic evaluation of saccharin, caffeine consumers had significantly greater activation in areas associated with memory and information processing. The findings suggest caffeine consumption is associated with differential activation in neuronal areas involved in reward, memory, and information processing. Further research on intensity and hedonics of bitter and sweet stimuli in caffeine consumers and non-consumers will be of great interest to better understand the nature of differences in taste perception between caffeine consumers and non-consumers.",Pharmacy Practice and Education in Slovenia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586866,"Pharmacy (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 30,"The PHARMINE (""Pharmacy Education in Europe"") project studied pharmacy practice and education in the European Union (EU) member states.

Subsequent studies, utilizing heterogeneous populations or different operational definitions of injury, have presented equivocal findings. Therefore, studies evaluating the efficacy of the Y-Balance Test to discriminate injury risk in a homogeneous population is warranted. One-hundred sixty-nine male (mean age 19.9 ± 1.5 y) collegiate basketball players were recruited during 2 consecutive seasons (2016⁻2017/2017⁻2018). Athletes completed the Y-Balance testing protocol at the start of each preseason. Athletic trainers tracked noncontact time-loss lower quadrant injuries over the course of the season. Receiver operator characteristic curves failed to identify cutoff scores; therefore, previously reported cutoff scores were utilized when calculating relative risk. There was no association between preseason Y-Balance Test scores and noncontact time-loss lower back or lower extremity injury in a population of male collegiate basketball players. This study adds to a growing body of evidence that demonstrates no relationship between preseason Y-Balance Test scores and subsequent injury.",Behavior of Wear Debris and Its Action Mechanism on the Tribological Properties of Medium-Carbon Steel with Magnetic Field.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586864,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 01 23,"Friction tests were conducted on self-matched pairs of medium-carbon steel using a pin-disk tribometer in an ambient laboratory environment with and without wear-debris removal, in order to clarify the influence of wear debris on the tribological properties of steels that were exposed to magnetic fields.

In the case that the wear debris was removed, the vast majority of wear debris was large, scarce oxidation, and no agglomeration, the grooves of various shapes and discontinuities, and no oxide layer were formed on the worn surface, severe wear occurred throughout the friction process. When the wear debris was not removed, the wear debris became fine, agglomeration and oxidation, a debris layer was formed on the worn surface, and the wear mode transitioned from severe to mild occurred during friction process. The results reveal that the re-entering of wear debris into the friction area is essential for the formation of a wear-debris layer and that an anti-wear effect can be achieved via the wear-debris layer formed on the worn surface during the friction process with a magnetic field.",Periostin Mediates Right Ventricular Failure through Induction of Inducible Nitric Oxide Synthase Expression in Right Ventricular Fibroblasts from Monocrotaline-Induced Pulmonary Arterial Hypertensive Rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586863,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 04 03,"Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) leads to lethal right ventricular failure (RVF). Periostin (POSTN) mRNA expression is increased in right ventricles (RVs) of monocrotaline (MCT)-induced PAH model rats. However, the pathophysiological role of POSTN in RVF has not been clarified. We investigated the effects of POSTN on inducible nitric oxide (NO) synthase (iNOS) expression and NO production, which causes cardiac dysfunction, in right ventricular fibroblasts (RVFbs). Male Wistar rats were intraperitoneally injected with MCT (60 mg/kg) or saline. Three weeks after injection, RVFbs were isolated from RVs of MCT- or saline-injected rats (MCT-RVFb or CONT-RVFb). In MCT-RVFb, iNOS expression and phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) were higher than those in CONT-RVFb. Recombinant POSTN increased iNOS expression and NO production, which were prevented by a pharmacological inhibition of ERK1/2, JNK or NF-κB in RVFbs isolated from normal rats. Culture medium of POSTN-stimulated RVFbs suppressed Ca2+ inflow through l-type Ca2+ channel (LTCC) in H9c2 cardiomyoblasts. We demonstrated that POSTN enhances iNOS expression and subsequent NO production via ERK1/2, JNK, and NF-κB signaling pathways in RVFbs. POSTN might mediate RVF through the suppression of LTCC activity of cardiomyocytes by producing NO from RVFbs in PAH model rats.",Evolution of Tuberculosis/Human Immunodeficiency Virus Services among Different Integrated Models in Myanmar: A Health Services Review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586862,Tropical medicine and infectious disease,2019 04 30,"Myanmar is one of the highly affected countries by tuberculosis (TB) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) co-infection.

One such technology, spatial video, has been used for fine-scale contextualized mapping. In this paper, we address one of the limitations of the technique: the global positioning system (GPS) coordinate error. More specifically, we show how spatial video coordinate streams can be corrected and synced back to the original video to facilitate risk mapping. Past spatial video collections for the Mathare informal settlement of Kenya are used as an illustration as these data had been previously discarded because of excessive GPS error. This paper will describe the bespoke software that makes these corrections possible, and then will go on to investigate patterns in the coordinate error.","Structural Transformations of Hydrolysates Obtained from Ti-, Zr-, and Ti, Zr-Solutions Used for Clay Pillaring: Towards Understanding of the Mixed Pillars Nature.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586860,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 01 23,"Structural characteristics of hydrolysates formed from the aqueous Ti-, Zr-, and Ti, Zr-pillaring solutions prepared from inorganic precursors (TiCl₄ and ZrOCl₂), was investigated and compared with that of precipitates obtained from the same solutions after a slight alkalization of pH to the values reported for the conditions of clay pillaring. The materials were recovered by lyophilization and subsequently subjected to calcination at 500, 800 and 1000 °C. Of special interest was the effect of pH on the possible formation of mixed Ti, Zr-oxide species. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy and scanning electron microscope/energy dispersive spectrometer (SEM/EDS) analysis showed that even a relatively moderate alteration of pH in Ti-, Zr-, or Ti, Zr-precursor solutions caused substantial changes in the outcome of hydrolytic transformations, manifested by different phase and/or chemical composition of the resulting hydrolysates. Analysis of thermal evolution of hydrolysates showed that alkalization facilitated the transformation of anatase into rutile in materials obtained from Ti-pillaring solution, but retarded tetragonal to monoclinic zirconia conversion in samples derived from Zr-pillaring agent. The most striking effect was observed for the mixed Ti, Zr-pillaring solution, where an increase of pH enabled the formation of zirconium titanate as the only crystalline phase, rather than a multiphase mixture of anatase, monoclinic zirconia and zirconium titanate obtained from the more acidic precursor. The finding supports the model of mixed Ti-O-Zr network in props generated in Ti, Zr-pillared montmorillonites."

Mycotoxins (aflatoxins, fumonisins, sterigmatocystin, nivalenol, deoxynivalenol, zearalenone, ochratoxin, and alternariol), bacterial toxins (shiga toxin and botulinum), biogenic amines, and cyanogenic glycosides are the common toxins found in FF in addition to the pathogenic microbes. Fermented milk products and meat sausages are extremely vulnerable to contamination. Cumulative updated information about a specific topic such as toxins in FF is essential for the improvement of safer preparation and consumption of fermented foods. Accordingly, the current manuscript summarizes the reported mycotoxins, bacterial toxins, and/or toxins from other sources; detection methods and prevention of toxins in FF (use of specific starter culture, optimized fermentation process, and pre- and post-processing treatments); and major clinical outbreaks.

Reference budgets are illustrative priced baskets containing the minimum goods and services necessary for well-described types of families to have an adequate social participation. This study was conducted starting from national FBDG, which were translated into monthly food baskets. Next, these baskets were validated in terms of their acceptability and feasibility through focus group discussions, and finally they were priced. Along the paper, we show how that food reference budgets hold interesting contributions to the promotion of healthy eating and prevention of food insecurity in low-income contexts in at least four ways: (1) they show how a healthy diet can be achieved with limited economic resources, (2) they bring closer to the citizen a detailed example of how to put FBDG recommendations into practice, (3) they ensure that food security is achieved in an integral way, by comprising the biological but also psychological and social functions of food, and (4) providing routes for further (comparative) research into food insecurity.",Is Patient-Provider Racial Concordance Associated with Hispanics' Satisfaction with Health Care?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586847,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 05 28,"This study adds a gender approach to determine how patient provider racial concordance and acculturation affect Hispanics' satisfaction with care and inform more nuanced approaches to improving the quality of care for this population. Using the Medical Expenditure Panel Surveys (MEPS) from 2009⁻2011, four binary satisfaction outcome measures were created from the MEPS: ""doctor showed respect"", ""spent enough time"", ""explained things in a way you could understand"", and ""listened carefully"". Next, a Probit model was employed to estimate the impact of racial concordance and acculturation on the probability of being satisfied with provider care for both male and female Hispanics. For Hispanic women, no significant association was found for the relationship between patient-provider concordance and the overall satisfaction with their care. Hispanic men were found to be less likely to be satisfied with some aspects of their medical care when they were racially concordant with their provider. Overcoming assumptions about shared identity is a crucial step in providing culturally competent care for all patients. There is a need for additional considerations in medical training to help physicians connect with patients, regardless of any type of observable concordance.",Impact of pH Modification on Protein Polymerization and Structure⁻Function Relationships in Potato Protein and Wheat Gluten Composites.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586846,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 04 03,"Wheat gluten (WG) and potato protein (PP) were modified to a basic pH by NaOH to impact macromolecular and structural properties. Films were processed by compression molding (at 130 and 150 °C) of WG, PP, their chemically modified versions (MWG, MPP) and of their blends in different ratios to study the impact of chemical modification on structure, processing and tensile properties. The modification changed the molecular and secondary structure of both protein powders, through unfolding and re-polymerization, resulting in less cross-linked proteins. The β-sheet formation due to NaOH modification increased for WG and decreased for PP. Processing resulted in cross-linking of the proteins, shown by a decrease in extractability; to a higher degree for WG than for PP, despite higher β-sheet content in PP. Compression molding of MPP resulted in an increase in protein cross-linking and improved maximum stress and extensibility as compared to PP at 130 °C. The highest degree of cross-linking with improved maximum stress and extensibility was found for WG/MPP blends compared to WG/PP and MWG/MPP at 130 °C. To conclude, chemical modification of PP changed the protein structures produced under harsh industrial conditions and made the protein more reactive and attractive for use in bio-based materials processing, no such positive gains were seen for WG.",Challenges and Lessons Learned from Multi-Level Multi-Component Interventions to Prevent and Reduce Childhood Obesity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586845,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 05 28,"Multi-level multi-component (MLMC) strategies have been recommended to prevent and reduce childhood obesity, but results of such trials have been mixed. The present work discusses lessons learned from three recently completed MLMC interventions to inform future research and policy addressing childhood obesity. B'more Healthy Communities for Kids (BHCK), Children's Healthy Living (CHL), and Health and Local Community (SoL) trials had distinct cultural contexts, global regions, and study designs, but intervened at multiple levels of the socioecological model with strategies that address multiple components of complex food and physical activity environments to prevent childhood obesity. We discuss four common themes: (i) How to engage with community partners and involve them in development of intervention and study design; (ii) build and maintain intervention intensity by creating mutual promotion and reinforcement of the intervention activities across the multiple levels and components; (iii) conduct process evaluation for monitoring, midcourse corrections, and to engage stakeholder groups; and (iv) sustaining MLMC interventions and its effect by developing enduring and systems focused collaborations. The paper expands on each of these themes with specific lessons learned and presents future directions for MLMC trials.",Enhanced Antioxidant Activity for Apple Juice Fermented with Lactobacillus plantarum ATCC14917.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586844,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 02 25,"The present study examined the effect of Lactobacillus plantarum ATCC14917 fermentation on the chemical composition and antioxidant activity of apple juice. Apple juice was fermented and examined of its antioxidant activity using chemical models and cellular antioxidant assay. Furthermore, the chemical composition of fermented apple juice was characterized by LC-MS/MS. Lactobacillus plantarum ATCC14917 fermentation showed an increase in DPPH and ABTS radical scavenging activity as well as cellular antioxidant activity of apple juice. However, fermentation decreased the total phenolic and flavonoid content. Subsequent LC-MS/MS analysis of the phenolic profile indicated that the content of 5-O-caffeoylquinic acid (5-CQA), quercetin, and phloretin with strong antioxidant activity was increased significantly after fermentation. The modified phenolic composition may contribute to the increased antioxidant activity of fermented apple juice. Our findings showed that Lactobacillus plantarum ATCC14917 fermentation may be an efficient way to enhance the bioavailability of phenolic compounds and to protect cells from oxidative stress.",Metabolizable Energy from Cashew Nuts is Less than that Predicted by Atwater Factors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586843,Nutrients,2019 02 15,"Recent studies have demonstrated that the energy provided by several tree nuts is less than that predicted by the Atwater factors, though energy available from cashews has never been assessed. The objective of this study was to evaluate the metabolizable energy in cashew nuts. Eighteen healthy adults were enrolled in a randomized, crossover study with two treatment periods. Subjects were fed a fully controlled base diet for 4 weeks with either no additions or with the addition of 42 g/day (1.5 servings) of cashew nuts, with the final treatment diets being isocaloric. Complete diet collections were analyzed for nitrogen (for protein), fat, energy, and carbohydrate by difference. During the final week of each intervention phase, subjects collected all feces and urine produced, and these were also analyzed for nitrogen (feces and urine), energy (feces and urine), and fat (feces). The resulting data were used to calculate the metabolizable energy of cashews and the digestibility of macronutrients. The average available energy (calorie) content of a 28 g serving of cashew nuts was 137 kcal (±3.4 kcal SEM) and ranged from 105 to 151 kcal. The mean value of 137 kcal/serving is 16% lower (p < 0.0001) than what is typically found on food labels. Digestibility of energy, fat, protein, and carbohydrate was lower for the cashew-containing diet compared to the control diet (92.9% vs. 94.9%, p < 0.0001 for energy; 96.1% vs. 97.8%, p = 0.0009 for fat; 90.1% vs. 91.2%, p = 0.0012 for protein; 92.9% vs. 94.9%, p < 0.0001 for carbohydrate; for the cashew-containing diet vs. the control diet, respectively). In conclusion, cashews provide fewer calories than the values predicted by the Atwater factors, as found on current food labels.","Nanoparticle-Based Biosensing of Tuberculosis, an Affordable and Practical Alternative to Current Methods.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586842,Biosensors,2019 04 24,"Access to community-based point-of-care, low-cost, and sensitive tuberculosis (TB) diagnostics remains an unmet need.",Case Report of Living Kidney Transplantation Using Ectopic Pelvic Kidney Harvested by Reduced Port Laparoscopic Donor Nephrectomy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586841,Transplantation proceedings,2019 03 20,"A 28-year-old woman was diagnosed as having an ectopic kidney in adolescence.

Laparoscopic donor nephrectomy was performed by reduced port surgery using the GelPOINT access platforms at a midline incision below the umbilicus with 1 accessory port. A thin artery of the donated kidney was ligated. An artery of the upper pole was anastomosed to the internal iliac artery, and a second artery was anastomosed directly to the inferior epigastric artery. Three veins were anastomosed to the external iliac vein: 1 anastomosed directly, 1 interposed by saphenous vein graft, and 1 interposed by harvested ovarian vein.

A quasi-experimental study was performed to assess the conditions of access to water for study and control groups (amounting to 380 households). The methodology encompassed two phases, one prior and another subsequent to the construction of a WSS in the study community. The analytical framework of the HRW was applied, specifically the normative content regarding quality, accessibility and availability. The case study's findings help to evidence the limitations and challenges of merely infrastructure-related measures to improve access to water. The construction of a new WSS in the studied community was an improvement as it provided water of good quality to the beneficiary households, which entailed a decreased or even a no-longer-existing need to collect water for children and adolescents. However, certain problems persisted, such as the continued practice of collecting water and the use, by certain families, of water that was fecally contaminated. In a different perspective, the WSS made it possible to increase the per capita volume of water consumed by families and to reduce inequalities associated with this aspect. Meanwhile, the research reveals the possible limits of the WSS in ensuring that higher volumes of water will be consumed per capita, especially among households without intra-household water distribution infrastructure.",Multiple drivers of plant diversity in coastal dunes: A Mediterranean experience.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586828,The Science of the total environment,2019 02 15,"In light of the global biodiversity loss, syntheses of the available knowledge about drivers of biodiversity are becoming increasingly important. However, despite the high number of studies analyzing patterns of plant species diversity, few attempts have been made to synthesize findings within different ecosystems. In this work, the relative role of a wide set of predictors imputable to three conceptual-methodological domains (abiotic, human-mediated disturbance and landscape domain, hereafter AD, DD and LD) was simultaneously analyzed in 644 random plots distributed along the coastal dunes of Central Italy. Native species richness and focal species cover, both field-recorded, were used as response variables. Predictors pertaining to the three domains were derived from both field surveys and high-resolution remotely sensed imagery (LiDAR and orthophotos). To test how AD, DD and LD affect native species richness and focal species cover, a GLM and a linear model were fitted respectively. The three domains were then ranked according to their relative importance. Although the role of the three domains was always significant, they turned out to unequally contribute to the explanation of native species richness and focal species cover patterns. For Mediterranean coastal dune ecosystems, AD appears to be the key biodiversity driver, followed by DD and LD. Our results suggest that as long as human disturbance is limited, plant diversity will distribute according to species abiotic tolerances, regardless of habitat loss and fragmentation per se. Representing a first effort towards a synthesis of plant diversity drivers in coastal dunes, this work points to the importance, in Mediterranean coastal dune ecosystems, of zonation dynamics, whose occurrence should be addressed as a priority issue by efficient conservations strategies.",Critical loads of acidity and exceedances for 1138 lakes and ponds in the Canadian Arctic.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586827,The Science of the total environment,2019 01 29,"Sulphur emissions associated with increased anthropogenic activity, such as resource extraction and marine shipping, may lead to the acidification of aquatic freshwater systems in the Arctic. In the current study, acid sensitivity (based on a critical load (CL(Ac)) approach) of 1138 lakes and ponds in the Canadian Arctic was quantified using the Steady-State Water Chemistry (SSWC) model. Ecosystem protection was based on an Acid Neutralising Capacity limit (ANClimit) for Arctic Char. Acidification risk was estimated under modelled sulphur deposition for the year 2010 (two scenarios). Overall, surface water CL(Ac) values for the Canadian Arctic were low (median = 35.8 meq·m-2·yr-1, mean = 96.3 meq·m-2·yr-1), with approximately 40% (n = 455) of sites estimated to be sensitive to acidification (CL(Ac) < 20 meq·m-2·yr-1). Higher CL(Ac) values were found in Yukon (434.5 meq·m-2·yr-1, n = 40), Ellesmere Is. (262.2 meq·m-2·yr-1, n = 143), and Southampton Is. (251.5 meq·m-2·yr-1, n = 35), while lower CL(Ac) values were found in Melville Is. (5.5 meq·m-2·yr-1, n = 48), Banks Is. (18.4 meq·m-2·yr-1, n = 45), and Bylot Is. (20.4 meq·m-2·yr-1, n = 36). Under modelled deposition for 2010, 12-12.5% (n = 136-142) of all sites were exceeded. The highest proportion of exceeded sites were observed in Ellef Ringnes Is. (48-60%; n = 12-15), Melville Is.

The recovery of NAs from produced water, and the corresponding distribution of detectable NAs are strongly influenced by sample extraction methodologies. In this study, we evaluated the effect of the extraction method on chemical space (i.e. the total number of chemicals present in a sample), relative recovery, and the distribution of NAs in a produced water sample. Three generic and pre-established extraction methods (i.e. liquid-liquid extraction (Lq), and solid phase extraction using HLB cartridges (HLB), and the combination of ENV+ and C8 (ENV) cartridges) were employed for our evaluation. The ENV method produced the largest number of detected NAs (134 out of 181) whereas the HLB and Lq methods produced 108 and 91 positive detections, respectively, in the tested produced water sample. For the relative recoveries, the ENV performed better than the other two methods. The uni-variate and multi-variate statistical analysis of our results indicated that the ENV and Lq methods explained most of the variance observed in our data. When looking at the distribution of NAs in our sample the ENV method appeared to provide a more complete picture of the chemical diversity of NAs in that sample. Finally, the results are further discussed.","Diversity analysis of water sources, uses, and flows from source to use in the USA.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586825,The Science of the total environment,2019 01 29,"Diversifying a system can reduce risk from- and increase resilience to perturbation. For this reason, the concept of diversity has been used in many different fields but its use in analyzing engineering infrastructure has been limited. In particular, the diversity of water sources and uses and the diversity of how sources are connected to uses (flow) have never been analyzed. In addition, the relationships between diversity and economic efficiency of water systems remain uncertain. In this study, we addressed these topics by conceptualizing and quantifying water source, use, and flow diversity in the USA. Water source and water use data were collected from the US Geological Survey for 2000, 2005, and 2010. Diversity was calculated with the Shannon Weaver Index. The overall mean water use diversity by state was 0.79 ± 0.31 (N = 150) and increased from 0.63 ± 0.31 in 2000 to 0.89 ± 0.28 by 2010, reflecting overall decreases in high-use categories, like thermonuclear power, and relative increases in already low domestic use. In contrast, source diversity showed no change over time, with an overall state mean of 0.82 ± 0.28 (N = 150) but varying between states largely due to differences in geographic and climatic factors influencing regional water sources. Water flow diversity also showed no change over time, averaging 1.00 ± 0.43 (N = 150), higher than both source and use diversity. The mean water use efficiency for all states over the study period was 52 ± 60 $/m3 of water and was positively and strongly related to both source and use diversity. Thus, the USA water system diversity is sensitive to factors logically expected to influence both source and use, and directly affects water use efficiency.",Exploring variability in environmental impact risk from human activities across aquatic ecosystems.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586824,The Science of the total environment,2019 02 15,"Aquatic ecosystems are under severe pressure. Human activities introduce an array of pressures that impact ecosystems and their components. In this study we focus on the aquatic domains of fresh, coastal and marine waters, including rivers, lakes and riparian habitats to transitional, coastal as well as shelf and oceanic habitats. In an environmental risk assessment approach, we identified impact chains that link 45 human activities through 31 pressures to 82 ecosystem components. In this linkage framework >22,000 activity-pressure-ecosystem component interactions were found across seven European case studies. We identified the environmental impact risk posed by each impact chain by first categorically weighting the interactions according to five criteria: spatial extent, dispersal potential, frequency of interaction, persistence of pressure and severity of the interaction, where extent, dispersal, frequency and persistence account for the exposure to risk (spatial and temporal), and the severity accounts for the consequence of the risk. After assigning a numerical score to each risk criterion, we came up with an overall environmental impact risk score for each impact chain. This risk score was analysed in terms of (1) the activities and pressures that introduce the greatest risk to European aquatic domains, and (2) the aquatic ecosystem components and realms that are at greatest risk from human activities. Activities related to energy production were relevant across the aquatic domains. Fishing was highly relevant in marine and environmental engineering in fresh waters. Chemical and physical pressures introduced the greatest risk to the aquatic realms. Ecosystem components that can be seen as ecotones between different ecosystems had high impact risk. We show how this information can be used in informing management on trade-offs in freshwater, coastal and marine resource use and aid decision-making.",Risk assessment of heavy metals in pipe scales and loose deposits formed in drinking water distribution systems.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586823,The Science of the total environment,2019 01 29,"The accumulation of inorganic contaminants in drinking water distribution systems (DWDS) can greatly threaten water quality and safety. This work mainly focused on the accumulation, speciation and risk assessment of inorganic contaminants found in pipe scales and loose deposits in DWDS. Global contamination factor (GCF), risk assessment code (RAC) and consensus-based sediment quality guidelines (CBSQGs) were adopted for the potential health risk assessment of inorganic contaminants. The Tessier sequential extraction method was used to study the speciation distribution of inorganic contaminants in fourteen samples (six pipe scale samples, eight loose deposit samples) collected from real DWDS. The significant correlation between Al and Mn showed there was a co-occurrence behavior of Al and Mn in pipe scales and loose deposits. In addition to the possible interactions between Al and Mn, Ba, Cu and As were possibly accumulated during the formation of Al and Mn commixtures. Mn, Cu, Pb, Zn, Ni, Co and Ba in the samples were mainly associated with the Fe-Mn oxides fraction, which indicated Fe-Mn oxides might play an important role in the accumulation and release of these inorganic contaminants. Fe, Al, As, Cr, V and Cd mainly existed in the residual fraction, which indicated their low mobility. The GCF results demonstrated that most of the sample sites had a certain environmental risk. The RAC results showed that high risk mainly resulted from Cd both in pipe scales and loose deposits. According to the CBSQGs evaluation, heavy metals in loose deposits were more harmful, and Ba exhibited the highest risk among all heavy metals.","Quantification and driving force analysis of ecosystem services supply, demand and balance in China.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586822,The Science of the total environment,2019 01 29,"Spatially quantifying ecosystem services (ES) supply, demand and balance dynamics and exploring their relations with socio-economic factors are very significant for regional sustainability. In this study, land use/land cover (LULC) matrix model was used to quantify the relevant capacity of the ES supply, demand and balance in China. Also, we explored the spatial-temporal characteristics of ES at three scales (national, provincial and city scale). The results revealed that the ES supply, demand and balance in China had strong spatial heterogeneity and showed different time-varying characteristics on different scales. For the provinces with ES deficit, linear optimization model was then applied to achieve the theoretical ES balance through land cover conversion. For the provinces with negative regulating ES, farmland should be significantly reduced while desert and grassland should be converted to farmland and forest for the provinces with negative provisioning ES. In addition, the key driving factors of ES dynamics were selected through ordination analysis of 109 cities at city scale. The results showed that forest proportion was the most important influencing factor of ecosystem services supply while ES supply management can be carried out by adjusting the output values of agriculture, forestry and animal husbandry. On the other hand, ES demand can be adjusted by per capita GDP, energy consumption per unit of GDP and permanent population. The results can provide targeted information with ES management and this method can be applied at a smaller scale considering data availability. This study provides a convenient and propagable method for ES quantification and a quantitative support for regional ES management decisions.",Modification of natural zeolite and its application to advanced recovery of organic matter from an ultra-short-SRT activated sludge process effluent.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586821,The Science of the total environment,2019 02 15,"Natural adsorbent was optimized from four natural adsorption materials (kaolin, bentonite, diatomite, and natural zeolite) through the comparison of their ability to recover organic matter from an ultra-short-sludge-retention-time (ultra-short-SRT) activated sludge process effluent. Natural zeolite was modified by the loading of three types of chemical coagulants (Fe2(SO4)3, Al2(SO4)3, and ZnSO4) and was used for the study of the advanced recovery of organic matter. The results of Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area (SBET) measurements, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses showed that natural zeolite was successfully modified, with decrease in the specific surface area of the modified zeolite (MZ), but some metal ions/metal oxides were loaded onto the surface of natural zeolite. Compared with chemical coagulant and natural zeolite, the organic recovery efficiency from the effluent of the MZs improved, and after the optimization process, the organic recovery efficiency of MZ4 (Zeolite:Fe2(SO4)3 = 4:1), MZ9 (Zeolite:Al2(SO4)3 = 4:1), and MZ13 (Zeolite:ZnSO4 = 2:1) reached 72.0%, 67.6%, and 61.2%, respectively. The MZs can allow a significant amount of recovery of soluble chemical oxygen demand (SCOD) from the effluent, with SCOD recovery efficiencies for MZ4, MZ9, and MZ13 of 44.8%, 44.3%, and 39.4%, respectively. The E4/E6, UV253/UV203, and SUVA analyses after the organic recovery experiments indicated that the generation potential of disinfecting byproducts or halogenated products was reduced in the treated effluent by the MZs. The mechanism can be considered in two ways: the coagulation effect of the loaded metal ions/metal oxides and the physical and chemical adsorption effect based on the hydrogen bond and ππ bond between the MZ and organic matter. This study facilitated the application of organic recovery from wastewater and the advanced treatment of effluent.",Alteration of freshwater ecosystem services under global change - A review focusing on the Po River basin (Italy) and the Red River basin (Vietnam).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586820,The Science of the total environment,2019 01 29,"Freshwater ecosystem services are negatively affected by factors such as climate change (e.g. changes in temperature, precipitation, and sea level rise) and human interventions (e.g. agriculture practices, impoundment of dams, and land use/land cover change). Moreover, the potential synergic impacts of these factors on ecosystems are unevenly distributed, depending on geographical, climatic and socio-economic conditions. The paper aims to review the complex effects of climatic and non-climatic drivers on the supply and demand of freshwater ecosystem services. Based on the literature, we proposed a conceptual framework and a set of indicators for assessing the above-mentioned impacts due to global change, i.e. climate change and human activities. Then, we checked their applicability to the provisioning services of two well-known case studies, namely the Po River basin (Italy) and the Red River basin (Vietnam). To define the framework and the indicators, we selected the most relevant papers and reports; identified the major drivers and the most relevant services; and finally summarized the fundamental effects of these drivers on those services. We concluded that the proposed framework was applicable to the analyzed case studies, but it was not straightforward to consider all the indicators since ecosystem services were not explicitly considered as key assessment endpoints in these areas. Additionally, the supply of ecosystem services was found to draw much more attention than their demand. Finally, we highlighted the importance of defining a common and consistent terminology and classification of drivers, services, and effects to reduce mismatches among ecosystem services when conducting a risk assessment."

High O3 concentration events tend to occur frequently in north China, Yangtze, the Pearl River Delta, and the Sichuan Basin, among others. Studies on the meteorological contribution to O3 in the troposphere have become a new direction for the scientific community. This research intends to explore how meteorological conditions contribute to O3 pollution in all seasons on the basis of further studies of the PLAM index. Our findings are as follows. (1) In pollution-sensitive areas, following a height uplift in the pollution mixing layer (H_PML), NO2 concentration decreases initially, followed by an explosive increase (EI) in O3 concentration after sunrise. (2) This process varies significantly by season and area. (3) According to an analysis of the meteorological conditions causing rises in O3 concentration within a few hours after sunrise, the initial decrease-subsequent increase in NO2 versus O3 concentration satisfies the law of exponent power rule, according to which seasonal and regional differences in coastal and inland areas depend on coefficients α and β. The explosive increase in O3 concentration, decrease in NO2 concentration, and characteristics of their diurnal cycles are also discussed. (4) Under the meteorological condition of static stability, below the static and stable cover, the H_PML of the polluted mixed layer consistently indicates the reciprocating cycle of day uplift and night pressure. The effect of air pump suction on the pollutant is an important mechanism of large-scale pollution in the study area under the condition of static and stable cover. (5) The influencing mechanism of meteorological conditions in the diurnal H_PML cycle aids in improving the understanding of O3 concentration increases in the troposphere.",Intensification of light green SF yellowish (LGSFY) photodegradion in water by iodate ions: Iodine radicals implication in the degradation process and impacts of water matrix components.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586808,The Science of the total environment,2019 01 29,"The results of this work showed that UV/IO3- oxidation process supplies good performance in the degradation of light green SF yellowish (LGSFY) dye in deionized water. This process generated reactive iodine radicals that make the degradation much faster than the sole UV irradiation. The assistance of UV-irradiation by 10 mM of iodate increased the LGSFY removal after 10 min from 36% to 90% for C0 = 10 mg/L and from 18% to 85% for C0 = 20 mg/L. In parallel, a 2.5 and 4.72-fold increase in the LGSFY initial degradation rate, as compared with UV alone, were recorded for, respectively, 10 and 20 mg/L of LGSFY. IO2 and IO played the most important role in the degradation of LGSFY by the UV/IO3- process. The degradation was not affected by the presence of chloride and nitrate ions even at high dosage levels (up to 0.1 M), whereas sulfate ions reduced the valuable effect of iodate to the half when they are present at 0.1 M. Correspondingly, humic acids, at usual concentrations as those measured in natural waters, did not affect significantly the LGSFY degradation upon photoactivated iodate process. These results revealed, in one part, that iodine radicals are selective oxidants and, in another part, that the process is likely to remove organic dyes from natural water which often contains mineral constitutes and humic substances.","Microplastic pollution in rice-fish co-culture system: A report of three farmland stations in Shanghai, China.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586807,The Science of the total environment,2019 02 15,"Microplastics are emerging contaminants of increasing concern. Despite the occurrence of microplastics in farmland soils, the knowledge on microplastics in rice-fish co-culture ecosystems is limited. In this study, we investigated the distribution of microplastics in three rice-fish culture stations in Shanghai. During non-rice and rice-planting periods, microplastics in water, soils and aquatic animals (eel, loach and crayfish) were systematically assayed using methods of NaCl density extraction, H2O2 digestion and micro-fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Results showed that average microplastic abundances were 0.4 ± 0.1 items L-1, 10.3 ± 2.2 items kg-1, 1.7 ± 0.5 items individual-1 in water, soils and aquatic animal samples, respectively. We found an increasing trend in microplastic abundances in water, soil and animal samples from non-rice period to rice-planting period. Almost all of microplastics were found in digestive tracts of animals. Major microplastics were small (<1 mm) polyethylene and polypropylene fibers, with color of white and translucent. Size, shape, color and polymer type distributions of microplastics were similarly found in environmental and animal samples. Moreover, microplastic abundances in aquatic animals correlated to abundance in farmland soils. This study, for the first time, reveals the occurrence and characteristics of microplastic pollution in rice-fish culture ecosystem which suggests the potential ecological risks of microplastics in the agroecosystem.",Contaminants removal and bacterial activity enhancement along the flow path of constructed wetland microbial fuel cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586806,The Science of the total environment,2019 02 15,"Microbial fuel cells implemented in constructed wetlands (CW-MFCs), albeit a relatively new technology still under study, have shown to improve treatment efficiency of urban wastewater. So far the vast majority of CW-MFC systems investigated were designed as lab-scale systems working under rather unrealistic hydraulic conditions using synthetic wastewater. The main objective of this work was to quantify CW-MFCs performance operated under different conditions in a more realistic setup using meso-scale systems with horizontal flow fed with real urban wastewater. Operational conditions tested were organic loading rate (4.9 ± 1.6, 6.7 ± 1.4 and 13.6 ± 3.2 g COD/m2·day) and hydraulic regime (continuous vs. intermittent feeding) as well as different electrical connections: CW control (conventional CW without electrodes), open-circuit CW-MFC (external circuit between anode and cathode not connected) and closed-circuit CW-MFC (external circuit connected). Eight horizontal subsurface flow CWs were operated for about four months. Each wetland consisted of a PVC reservoir of 0.193 m2 filled with 4/8 mm granitic riverine gravel (wetted depth 25 cm). All wetlands had intermediate sampling points for gravel and interstitial liquid sampling. The CW-MFCs were designed as three MFCs incorporated one after the other along the flow path of the CWs. Anodes consisted of gravel with an incorporated current collector (stainless steel mesh) and the cathode consisted of a graphite felt layer. Electrodes of closed-circuit CW-MFC systems were connected externally over a 220 Ω resistance. Results showed no significant differences between tested organic loading rates, hydraulic regimes or electrical connections, however, on average, systems operated in closed-circuit CW-MFC mode under continuous flow outperformed the other experimental conditions. Closed-circuit CW-MFC compared to conventional CW control systems showed around 5% and 22% higher COD and ammonium removal, respectively. Correspondingly, overall bacteria activity, as measured by the fluorescein diacetate technique, was higher (4% to 34%) in closed-circuit systems when compared to CW control systems.","Phthalate esters in indoor dust from several regions, China and their implications for human exposure.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586805,The Science of the total environment,2019 02 15,"Phthalate esters (PAEs) have been used in large quantities all over the world for decades, leading to ubiquitous occurrence in the indoor environment. Indoor dust samples were collected from six geographical regions in China (n = 120) and the concentrations, profiles and human exposure to nine prevalent PAEs from dust were investigated in this study. The total concentrations of nine PAEs (Σ9PAEs) varied from 2.31 to 1590 μg/g (mean: 150 μg/g). The highest concentration of Σ9PAEs was found for dusts from the geographical region of Northeast China (mean: 394 μg/g), which was nearly 8 times higher than that of the lowest value for dusts from the Southwest China (52.1 μg/g). The sum concentrations of six priority controlled PAEs, namely dimethyl phthalate (DMP), diethyl phthalate (DEP), di-n-butyl phthalate (DBP), benzyl butyl phthalate (BzBP), bis (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) and di-n-octyl phthalate (DNOP), in our study (mean: 133 μg/g) were lower than those found in other regions of the world (230-1280 μg/g) reported in earlier studies. DEHP, DBP and di-iso-butyl phthalate (DIBP) were the major congeners found in all dust samples, cumulatively accounting for 98.7% of Σ9PAEs. The daily intake (DI) of PAEs via dust through the routes of ingestion, inhalation and dermal contact was estimated. Comparably, dust ingestion is the major pathway of human exposure to PAEs from dust and the DI values through dust ingestion were 985 ng/kg/day for children and 126 ng/kg/day for adults in China, respectively. The contribution of indoor dust to the total exposure of human to PAEs varied, depending on the type of PAE congeners. Among PAE congeners, DEHP was the predominant contributor, accounting for 3.45% and 2.39% of the estimated total DIs for Chinese children and adults, respectively. This indicates that indoor dust is an important source of human exposure to certain PAE congeners.","Source areas, connectivity, and delivery rate of sediments in mountainous-forested hillslopes: A probabilistic approach.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586804,The Science of the total environment,2019 01 29,"In mountainous-forested landscape, quantifying the materials produced at hillslope scale that effectively reach the channel network with a given probability is currently challenging, due to the uncertainties in modelling the frequency-magnitude distribution of failures and in determining the sediment connectivity between unstable areas and channel network. The purpose of this study is to develop a modular approach to assess the sediment source areas and the probability of mobilization from hillslope, and to estimate the probability of sediment input to the streams proposing a new connectivity index. The first goal was faced adopting a 3D probabilistic slope stability method that includes the spatially distributed characteristics of forest coverage. The second aim was tackled by comparing sediment travel distance and the minimum-topographic distance to reach the nearest stream. A simple deposition model was applied to estimate the percentage of the sediment entering into the stream network. The methodology was tested on three headwater catchments in northern Italian Alps. The outputs were landslide susceptibility maps, which showed robust performances when compared to the available landslide inventories (AUC > 0.726), and maps of the probability that sediment reaches the channel network. In this way, it was possible to identify which areas are the most susceptible to landsliding, how many sediment materials can be mobilised with a given probability, and which is the degree of sediment connectivity with the channel system. Results obtained for the tested catchments, compared with data available from the literature, showed that the proposed methodology is of general validity, especially for those territories characterized by rainfall-triggered landslides and forest coverage. This study, then, provides a robust framework to improve debris-flow risk management and to implement watershed management strategies, such as planning forestry operations or positioning retention structures addressed to increase slope stability and to reduce sediment delivery.",Impact factor assessment of the uptake and accumulation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons by plant leaves: Morphological characteristics have the greatest impact.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586802,The Science of the total environment,2019 02 15,"Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) have toxic, teratogenic, mutagenic and carcinogenic effects on living organisms. Plants can function as pollutant bioindicators and bioaccumulators due to their wide surface distribution and specific responses to atmospheric pollutants. However, various plants exhibit significant differences in their capacities to accumulate PAHs. At present, research has mainly focused on the effects of leaf morphology and physiological characteristics, and few studies have evaluated the effects of the leaf surface on PAH accumulation. We aimed to assess the factors impacting the uptake and accumulation of PAHs by leaves. We selected 8 common tree species in Shanghai, China, and used supercritical fluid extraction technology to determine the content of PAHs in their leaves. Specific measurements of leaf area, width/length, wax content, and stomatal density were applied to index the morphological and physiological characteristics; surface roughness, surface free energy, polar components, and dispersion components were compiled into an adsorption performance index. Principal component analysis (PCA) and canonical correlation analysis (CCA) were used to assess the effects of different leaf characteristics on PAH accumulation. We found that the mean concentrations of ΣPAHs ranged from 300 to 2000 ng·g-1 and that the proportions of different benzene rings were significantly different among the different tree species. Leaf morphology and physiological characteristics had more significant effects compared to surface adsorption. CCA showed a significant negative correlation between leaf morphological characteristics and wax content, but had no significant correlation with surface adsorption. Low-molecular-weight PAHs were found to be mainly affected by the morphological characteristics, while medium- and high-molecular-weight PAHs were influenced by wax content and adsorption. Our conclusions provide a theoretical basis for the establishment of a reliable plant atmosphere-monitoring system and a method for screening tree species with strong PAH adsorption capacity.",Alteration of gaseous nitrogen losses via anaerobic ammonium oxidation coupled with ferric reduction from paddy soils in Southern China.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586800,The Science of the total environment,2019 02 15,"The bacteria-mediated anaerobic ammonium oxidation under iron reducing conditions, termed feammox, represents a process for alleviating N accumulation in anoxic soils. Fertilization, as an important agricultural strategy, needs to be investigated in order to determine its effects on nitrogen (N) removal via the feammox process in paddy soils. In this study, a slurry incubation experiment was conducted in fertilized paddy soils with a gradient of microbial reducible Fe(III) levels obtained from Southern China using 15N-isotope tracing techniques. Four fertilizer treatments were examined: an un-fertilized control (NF), chemical fertilizers (CF), chemical fertilizers plus manure (CMF) and chemical fertilizers plus crop straw (CSF). It was estimated that the potential N losses linked with feammox were 3.6-24.9 kg N ha-1 y-1 in all the examined soils. Compared to the unfertilized soil (NF), fertilization stimulated feammox and led to higher (3.4-5.8 times) N losses. We postulate that the variations in the extent and rate of feammox between the unfertilized and fertilized soils were most likely due to differences in the abundance of the Acidimicrobiaceae bacterium A6 and the amounts of microbial reducible Fe(III). Further, the variations between soil treated with fertilizer (CF) only and soils coupled organic-chemical fertilizer (CMF and CSF) were due to the differences in the electron transfer mechanism mediated by electron shuttles from bacteria to Fe(III) minerals arising from the organic carbon applied. Overall, this study clearly illustrated the stimulatory effects of fertilization on feammox that resulted in higher N losses and suggested that feammox could be a crucial N removal pathway in paddy soils.",Diesel exhausts particles: Their role in increasing the incidence of asthma. Reviewing the evidence of a causal link.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586799,The Science of the total environment,2019 02 15,"Exposure to air pollutants has been correlated with an increase in the severity of asthma and in the exacerbation of pre-existing asthma. However, whether or not environmental pollution can cause asthma remains a controversial issue. The present review analyzes the current scientific evidence of the possible causal link between diesel exhaust particles (DEP), the solid fraction of the complex mixture of diesel exhaust, and asthma. The mechanisms that influence the expression and development of asthma are complex. In children prolonged exposure to pollutants such as DEPs may increase asthma prevalence. In adults, this causal relation is less clear, probably because of the heterogeneity of the studies carried out. There is also evidence of physiological mechanisms by which DEPs can cause asthma. The most frequently described interactions between cellular responses and DEP are the induction of pulmonary oxidative stress and inflammation and the activation of receptors of the bronchial epithelium such as toll-like receptors or increases in Th2 and Th17 cytokines, which generally orchestrate the asthmatic response. Others support indirect mechanisms through epigenetic changes, pulmonary microbiome modifications, or the interaction of DEP with environmental antigens to enhance their activity. However, in spite of this evidence, more studies are needed to assess the harmful effects of pollution - not only in the short term in the form of increases in the rate of exacerbations, but in the medium and long term as well, as a possible trigger of the disease.","Participatory coastal management through elicitation of ecosystem service preferences and modelling driven by ""coastal squeeze"".",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586798,The Science of the total environment,2019 01 29,"The Baixo Vouga Lagunar (BVL) is part of Ria de Aveiro coastal lagoon in Portugal, which is classified as a Special Protection Area under the European Habitats and Birds Directives. This part of the system, corresponding to the confluence of the Vouga River with the lagoon, is very important culturally and socioeconomically for the local communities, taking place several human activities, especially agriculture. To prevent salt water intrusion from the Ria de Aveiro into agriculture fields, a floodbank was initiated in the 90's. In frame of ongoing changes in Ria de Aveiro hydrodynamics, the existing floodbank will be now extended, introducing further changes in the ecological dynamics of the BVL and its adjacent area. As a consequence, the water level in the floodbank downstream side is expected to rise, increasing the submersion period in tidal wetlands, and leading to coastal squeeze. The aim of this study is to apply an ecosystem based-management approach to mitigate the impacts on biodiversity resulting from the management plan. To do so, we have modelled the implications of the changes in several hydrological and environmental variables on four saltmarsh species and habitats distribution, as well as on their associated ecosystem services, both upstream and downstream of the floodbank. The ecosystem services of interest were prioritized by stakeholders' elicitation, which were then used as an input to a spatial multi-criteria analysis aimed to find the best management actions to compensate for the unintended loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services in the BVL. According to our results, the main areas to be preserved in the BVL were the traditional agricultural mosaic fields; the freshwater courses and the subtidal estuarine channels. By combining ecology with the analysis of social preferences, this study shows how co-developed solutions can support adaptive management and the conservation of coastal ecosystems."

However, it is unknown how MG53 from muscle regulates systemic insulin response and energy metabolism. Increasing evidence demonstrates that muscle secretes proteins as myokines or cardiokines that regulate systemic metabolic processes. We hypothesize that MG53 may act as a myokine/cardiokine, contributing to interorgan regulation of insulin sensitivity and metabolic homeostasis.","Early Risks of Death, Stroke/Systemic Embolism, and Major Bleeding in Patients With Newly Diagnosed Atrial Fibrillation.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586740,Circulation,2019 02 04,"Atrial fibrillation is associated with increased risks of death, stroke/systemic embolism, and bleeding (incurred by antithrombotic therapy), which may occur early after diagnosis.","Frequency, Regional Variation, and Predictors of Undetermined Cause of Death in Cardiometabolic Clinical Trials: A Pooled Analysis of 9259 Deaths in 9 Trials.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586739,Circulation,2019 02 13,"Modern cardiometabolic clinical trials often include cardiovascular death as a component of a composite primary outcome, requiring central adjudication by a clinical events committee to classify cause of death.

In this study, we investigated the effect of maitake α-glucan YM-2A, isolated from Grifola frondosa, on the maturation and function of DCs and its adjuvant effect on a tumor-associated antigen (TAA)-loaded DC vaccine against murine tumor. We showed that YM-2A induced morphological changes and increased cell-surface maturation markers and cytokine production in DCs. In a mixed lymphocyte reactions assay, YM-2A-treated DCs increased proliferation and production of IFN-γ by allogeneic CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. These results indicate that YM-2A phenotypically and functionally activates DCs. Furthermore, YM-2A-treated TAA-loaded DC vaccine significantly reduced tumor growth and improved survival in two murine tumor models, CT-26 tumor-bearing BALB/c mice and B16 melanoma-bearing C57BL/6 mice. YM-2A-treated TAA-loaded DC vaccine increased splenic IFN-γ producing CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in CT-26 tumor-bearing BALB/c mice.

However, for strength- and physique-based athletes, sports nutrition research and recommendations have focused on protein ingestion, with far less attention given to carbohydrates. Varying resistance exercise protocols, such as differences in intensity, volume, and intraset rest prescriptions between strength-training and physique-training goals elicit different metabolic responses, which may necessitate different carbohydrate needs. The results of several acute and chronic training studies suggest that although severe carbohydrate restriction may not impair strength adaptations during a resistance training program, consuming an adequate amount of carbohydrate in the days leading up to testing may enhance maximal strength and strength-endurance performance. Although several molecular studies demonstrate no additive increases in postexercise mammalian target of rapamycin 1 phosphorylation with carbohydrate and protein compared with protein ingestion alone, the effects of chronic resistance training with carbohydrate restriction on muscle hypertrophy are conflicting and require further research to determine a minimal carbohydrate threshold necessary to optimize muscle hypertrophy. This review summarizes the current knowledge regarding carbohydrate availability and resistance training outcomes and poses new research questions that will better help guide carbohydrate recommendations for strength and physique athletes.

However, several studies have suggested that NSAIDs inhibit the antidepressant effects of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in humans and mice. The present study investigated the effects of escitalopram (ESC) and ibuprofen (IBU), alone or in combination, on the stress-induced behavior and expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and p11, markers of depression and antidepressant action, in chronically stressed rats. Rats were subjected to chronic restraint stress (CRS) for 3 weeks and administered the following drugs: single administration of ESC or IBU or co-administration of ESC and IBU (ESC + IBU). Immobility time was measured by the forced swimming test (FST), and hippocampal BDNF and p11 levels were analyzed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting. CRS increased immobility time on the FST. Administration of ESC, IBU, or ESC + IBU significantly attenuated the stress-induced increase in immobility time. CRS also significantly increased plasma corticosterone concentration by 169%. This effect was significantly recovered by administering ESC, IBU, or ESC + IBU. The levels of BDNF and p11 in the hippocampus decreased significantly in response to CRS. These decreases were prevented by administering ESC, IBU, or ESC + IBU. These findings suggest that both single and co-administration of ESC and IBU exerts antidepressant effects. These effects were associated with upregulation of BDNF and p11 expression.",Central nervous system circuits that control body temperature.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586638,Neuroscience letters,2019 05 29,"Maintenance of mammalian core body temperature within a narrow range is a fundamental homeostatic process to optimize cellular and tissue function, and to improve survival in adverse thermal environments. Body temperature is maintained during a broad range of environmental and physiological challenges by central nervous system circuits that process thermal afferent inputs from the skin and the body core to control the activity of thermoeffectors. These include thermoregulatory behaviors, cutaneous vasomotion (vasoconstriction and, in humans, active vasodilation), thermogenesis (shivering and brown adipose tissue), evaporative heat loss (salivary spreading in rodents, and human sweating). This review provides an overview of the central nervous system circuits for thermoregulatory reflex regulation of thermoeffectors.",Memantine mediates astrocytic activity in response to excitotoxicity induced by PP2A inhibition.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586637,Neuroscience letters,2019 05 29,"Reduced activity of protein phosphatase 2 A (PP2A) is a common feature in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and non-AD tauopathies. The administration of okadaic acid (OKA), a potent PP2A and PP1 inhibitor, is a common research tool for inducing AD-like alterations such as tau hyperphosphorylation and cognitive decline. Recently, we showed that OKA increases cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) glutamate levels, which was strongly correlated with cognitive decline. Also, we demonstrated that memantine (MN), a glutamatergic NMDAR channel blocker, was capable of preventing the increase in CSF glutamate levels and cognitive decline. Here, we aimed to analyze whether the protective effects of MN involve intrinsic astrocytic properties, particularly related to glutamate uptake and astrocytic reactivity - indexed by the expression of S100B and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). Rats received intraperitoneal injections of MN or saline over 3 consecutive days before receiving intrahippocampal infusion of OKA or saline. Afterward, they were submitted to behavioral tasks and then, euthanatized for neurochemical analysis. Here, we showed that the neuroprotective effects of MN in response to OKA neurotoxicity involve astrocytic activation. MN decreased glutamate uptake in the hippocampus and increased the release of S100B protein in the CSF in response to OKA neurotoxicity, which indicates a possible neurons-astrocyte coupling protective mechanism. These findings shed light on astrocytes as potential targets for treating neurological disorders associated with decreased PP2A activity.",Bone adaptation compensates resorption when sciatic neurectomy is followed by low magnitude induced loading.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586636,Bone,2019 02 03,"The uniaxial tibial loading model is commonly used to promote bone formation through mechanoadaptation in mice. Sciatic neurectomy on the other hand recruits osteoclasts, which results in bone loss. Previous studies have shown that combining sciatic neurectomy with high magnitude loading increases the amount of bone formed. Here we determine whether low-intensity loading (low magnitude and few cycles) is sufficient to maintain bone mass after sciatic neurectomy, either by promoting bone formation (balance between concurrent resorption and formation), or by preventing bone resorption altogether. We examined bone adaptation in 4 groups of female C57BL/6J mice, 19-22 weeks old: (1) sham surgery +10 N loading; (2) sham surgery +5 N loading; (3) sciatic neurectomy; (4) sciatic neurectomy +5 N loading. Left legs were kept intact as internal controls. We examined changes in bone cross sectional properties and marrow area with micro-CT images, and histomorphometric measures with histological sections at the midpoint between tibiofibular junctions. Loading at 10 N caused a significant increase in the amount of bone, but bone formation after 5 N of loading was not detectable in micro-CT images. There was significant bone loss in mice with sciatic neurectomy alone, but when combined with loading there was no significant bone loss. Histomorphometric analyses showed that loading at 5 N augmented bone formation periosteally on the lateral and posterior-medial surfaces, and reduced the number of endosteal osteoclasts on the posterior-medial surface compared to the contralateral leg. Combining sciatic neurectomy and loading at 5 N promoted faster mineral apposition on the periosteal lateral surface and augmented bone resorption on the endosteal posterior surface compared to the contralateral leg. These data demonstrate that low-intensity loading is sufficient to maintain bone mass after sciatic neurectomy, both by preventing recruitment of osteoclasts on the endosteal surface and by compensating endosteal resorption caused by disuse with periosteal formation promoted by loading. This has implications for the loading required to maintain bone mass after injury or prolonged bedrest.",Apocynin alters redox signaling in conductance and resistance vessels of spontaneously hypertensive rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586635,Free radical biology & medicine,2019 04 08,"Chronic treatment with apocynin reduces blood pressure and prevents endothelial dysfunction development in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Mechanisms underlying apocynin effects on SHR remain unclear. Compared to diapocynin and other drugs, apocynin is a weak antioxidant, which suggests that its effects on SHR are associated with other mechanisms besides its antioxidant capacity. Angiotensin (Ang) II regulates NOX, the major reactive oxygen species (ROS) source in the cardiovascular system. We hypothesized that, by inhibiting NOX, apocynin could alter Ang II pressor and vasoconstrictor effects on SHR. We analyzed how Ang II affects blood pressure and vascular reactivity in aorta and mesenteric resistance arteries and evaluated plasma antioxidant capacity, NOX isoforms and subunits, NOS isoforms, AT1 and AT2 receptors expression, ROS production, and NOS activity in apocynin-treated SHR blood vessels (30 mg/Kg/day, p.o.). In SHR, apocynin reduced Ang II pressor effects, increased plasmatic antioxidant capacity, and blunted aortic and mesenteric NOX-dependent oxidants production and NOX2 and p47phox overexpression, which demonstrated that apocynin inhibits NOX in SHR blood vessels. Moreover, apocynin raised plasmatic and aortic nitrate/nitrite levels, maintained NOS activity and eNOS, p-eNOS, nNOS, iNOS, sGC-α, and sGC-β expression in mesenteric bed, diminished AT1 expression in aorta and mesenteric bed, and elevated AT2 expression in SHR aorta. Apocynin increased Ang II vasoconstriction endothelial modulation in SHR resistance arteries. All these results showed that in vivo treatment with apocynin alters several mechanisms that reduce Ang II pressor and vasoconstrictor effects on SHR. Such apocynin effects involve other mechanisms besides vascular ROS modulation, which improves NO availability in SHR vascular cells. These integrated data could help us to understand the promising apocynin activity as an antihypertensive drug that acts differently from the drugs that are currently being used in the clinical setting."

Most 27OH in circulation is formed extracerebrally and according to catheterization experiments about 5 mg of it is taken up by the brain per 24 h. 24OH is almost exclusively produced in the brain and about 6 mg fluxes from the brain into the circulation per 24 h. In addition to these major fluxes a very minor fraction of these two oxysterols flux from the circulation into CSF. Isotope experiments have shown that almost all 27OH in CSF originates from the circulation and evidence has been presented that this is the case also with a substantial part of 24OH. The levels of both 24OH and 27OH in CSF are thus affected by the integrity of the blood-CSF barrier with higher levels when the barrier is defect. Both levels of 24OH and 27OH in CSF are increased in connection with neurodegeneration and in general the increase in 24OH levels is higher than the increase in 27OH levels. A number of observations in different type of patients including measurements of other biochemical markers support that the increase in levels of 24OH due to neurodegeneration is due to a release of this oxysterol or its precursor cholesterol from dying neuronal cells. In contrast the increase in levels of 27OH is likely to be a consequence of reduced metabolism due to loss of the neuronal enzyme CYP7B1. We discuss the driving forces behind the fluxes of oxysterols in the brain, the limitations in the flux across the barriers and the diagnostic potential for side-chain oxidized oxysterols in CSF.",A High-Calorie Diet Aggravates Mitochondrial Dysfunction and Triggers Severe Liver Damage in Wilson Disease Rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586623,Cellular and molecular gastroenterology and hepatology,2019 06 04,"In Wilson disease, ATP7B mutations impair copper excretion into bile. Hepatic copper accumulation may induce mild to moderate chronic liver damage or even acute liver failure. Etiologic factors for this heterogeneous phenotype remain enigmatic. Liver steatosis is a frequent finding in Wilson disease patients, suggesting that impaired copper homeostasis is linked with liver steatosis. Hepatic mitochondrial function is affected negatively both by copper overload and steatosis. Therefore, we addressed the question of whether a steatosis-promoting high-calorie diet aggravates liver damage in Wilson disease via amplified mitochondrial damage.",Do Pain Measurement Instruments Detect the Effect of Pain-Reducing Interventions in Neonates? A Systematic Review on Responsiveness.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586622,The journal of pain : official journal of the American Pain Society,2019 01 19,"The effectiveness of pain-reducing interventions in newborns can only be determined if pain measurement instruments are responsive; that is, able to detect a decrease in pain intensity after the pain-reducing intervention. This review assesses the methodologic quality of studies on this measurement property-the responsiveness. We searched the literature published until January 2018 for validation studies of pain measurement instruments focusing on responsiveness to pain-reducing treatment in neonates. The methodologic quality of the included studies was rated using the COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement INstruments checklist. Nine studies were included involving 10 pain measurement instruments. These studies differed with respect to the population, setting and type of pain-reducing intervention. In all studies, pain scores were significantly lower after a pain-reducing intervention and the instrument used was therefore considered responsive. We rated 4 studies as having poor methodologic quality, 5 as fair quality, and none as good quality. In conclusion, the responsiveness was studied for only 10 of the 43 existing pain measurement instruments for the use in neonates. Because this is an important property of a pain instrument, more research on this topic is needed, with attention for blinding and formulating a specific hypothesis before start of data collection. PERSPECTIVE: This review focuses on the property of measurement instruments to detect changes in pain intensity after a pain-reducing intervention in neonates. We concluded that this property-the responsiveness-is under studied and that the methodologic quality of the included studies was low. Future high-quality validation studies should focus on responsiveness.",SPM-1-producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa ST277 carries a chromosomal pack of acquired resistance genes: An example of high-risk clone associated with 'intrinsic resistome'.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586621,Journal of global antimicrobial resistance,2019 03 23,The purpose of this study was to investigate the resistome of an SPM-1-producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa ST277 isolate (HC84) from Brazil.,Cytokine Release Syndrome with Chimeric Antigen Receptor T Cell Therapy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586620,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,2019 04 08,"Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-modified T cells (CAR-Ts) targeting CD19 have resulted in unprecedented durable remissions for patients with relapsed and refractory B cell malignancies. Cytokine release syndrome (CRS), resulting from rapid immune activation induced by CAR-Ts, is the most significant treatment-related toxicity. CRS initially manifests with fever and can progress to life-threatening capillary leak with hypoxia and hypotension. The clinical signs of CRS correlate with T cell activation and high levels of cytokines including IL-6. Tocilizumab, an anti-IL-6 receptor antagonist, is the standard for CRS management, but optimal timing of administration is unclear. The development of a supportive infrastructure by treatment centers is important to maintain safe administration as access expands. Collaborative efforts are underway to harmonize the definition and grading of CRS to allow for better interpretation of toxicities across CAR-T products and clinical trials and allow for informed management algorithms.","Cullin 3, a cellular scripter of the non-proteolytic ubiquitin code.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586619,Seminars in cell & developmental biology,2019 01 01,"Cullin-RING ubiquitin ligases (CRLs) represent the largest family of E3 ubiquitin ligases that control most if not all cellular processes. In CUL3-based CRLs, the substrate specificity is conferred by the interaction with one of around 183 existing BTB proteins, implying a broad spectrum of possible ubiquitylation signals and possible direct ubiquitylation substrates. Indeed, CUL3-based E3-ligases can catalyze various proteolytic and non-proteolytic ubiquitin signals regulating many physiological and pathophysiological states. Here, we discuss the recent studies focusing on the non-proteolytic CUL3-based signaling in mammalian cells, which emerge as important pathways during cell division, embryonic development as well as other biological processes. Mechanistically, non-proteolytic ubiquitin signals generated by CUL3 E3-ligases often regulate substrates' interactions with other downstream factors or their subcellular localization. Existing data also demonstrate an interplay with the proteolytic ubiquitylation catalyzed on the same substrates by different E3-ligases or by the same CUL3-BTB CRL3s on different substrates. In future, a deeper understanding of the upstream spatiotemporal regulatory mechanisms will help to dissect this fascinating CUL3 ubiquitin code.",In vitro aminolevulinic acid mediated-antimicrobial photodynamic therapy inactivates growth of Prototheca wickerhamii but does not change antibacterial and antifungal drug susceptibiltity profile.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586618,Photodiagnosis and photodynamic therapy,2019 03 30,Antimicrobial photodynamic therapy(aPDT) has been used to treat localized cutaneous fungal infections that have an enhanced antifungal susceptibility profile.

Human infections include mycetoma, keratitis and onychomycosis, while deeper mycosis occurs in immunocompromised patients. Most of the Fusarium spp. are frequently resistant to treatment with currently used antifungals. The frequent occurrence of antifungal resistance has motivated the study of antimicrobial photodynamic therapy as an alternative treatment for fungal infections. Many studies have investigated the in vitro use of antimicrobial photodynamic therapy to kill fungi, but rarely in animal models of infection. Thus, here we employed the invertebrate wax moth Galleria mellonella to study the in vivo effects of antimicrobial photodynamic therapy with three different phenothiazinium photosensitizers, methylene blue, new methylene blue N and the pentacyclic S137 against infection with microconidia of Fusarium keratoplasticum and Fusarium moniliforme. The effect of antimicrobial photodynamic therapy using these photosensitizers and light-emitting diodes with an emission peak at 635 nm and an integrated irradiance from 570 to 670 nm of 9.8 mW cm-2 was investigated regarding the toxicity, fungal burden, larval survival and cellular immune response. The results from this model indicate that antimicrobial photodynamic therapy with methylene blue, new methylene blue N and S137 is efficient for the treatment of infection with F. keratoplasticum and F. moniliforme. The efficiency can be attributed to the fungal cell damage caused by antimicrobial photodynamic therapy which facilitates the action of the host immune response.",Transposition procedures in Duane retraction syndrome.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586616,Journal of AAPOS : the official publication of the American Association for Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus,2019 04 10,"Duane retraction syndrome, or Duane syndrome (DS), is one of several congenital cranial dysinnervation disorders. Patients present with limited horizontal eye movement(s) and globe retraction with eyelid fissure narrowing on attempted adduction due to co-contraction of the lateral and medial rectus muscles in one or both eyes. Various surgical approaches have been proposed to improve binocular alignment, reduce head turn, and minimize undesirable up- or downshoots in DS. Transposition procedures are one such approach, and a number of techniques have been described. These may involve one or both vertical rectus muscles and may or may not include full or partial disinsertion of the rectus muscle(s) from the insertion. Options involving both vertical rectus muscles include full vertical rectus transposition (VRT), partial VRT, rectus muscle union, and other modifications to be discussed. Options involving one vertical rectus muscle include superior rectus transposition (SRT) and inferior rectus transposition (IRT). The effectiveness of any transposition procedure may be enhanced with augmentation (posterior fixation) sutures, resection of the transposed muscle(s), and/or simultaneous weakening of the ipsilateral medial rectus muscle. This review discusses the indications, strengths, weaknesses, and other considerations of these approaches within the context of DS. Since the majority of DS cases are unilateral and most have the esotropic form, this will be the main focus of the review, although other forms will also be discussed.",'Prevalence and determinants for xerosis cutis in the middle-aged and elderly population: a cross-sectional study'.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586613,Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology,2018 12 26,Determinants and the extent of dry skin in healthy middle-aged and elderly populations have not been well established.

Among a sample of 1493 high school students, the current study utilizes a risks and resources model to examine ways that risks and resources come together to shape the lives and health of youth, making them more vulnerable or shielding them from food insecurity and its related negative health outcomes. A number of factors are proposed as important correlates of food insecurity measured at four perceived levels of aggregation: individual, family, school/peer, and community. These risks and resources are analyzed using a three-step ordinal regression model. Analyses reveal depression, intact family, student risk, and neighborhood risk are positively related to food insecurity, despite significant sociodemographic differences. In addition, self-esteem, eating meals with family, and peer social capital are all significant and negatively related to food insecurity. Collectively, these findings tell an important story about adolescent food insecurity and the relationships that social and psychological circumstances have with varying levels of food insecurity. This study highlights the importance of children and adolescents as reliable respondents and spokespersons of their own experiences with food insecurity.",Is thin in everywhere?: A cross-cultural comparison of a subsection of Tripartite Influence Model in Australia and Malaysia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586595,Appetite,2019 02 12,"Despite growing research investigating prevalence rates of BD among Malaysian women, there has been limited research conducted in Malaysia with respect to factors contributing to its development and consequences. This study tested a subsection of the Tripartite Influence Model, investigating whether sociocultural influences (family, peers, media) lead to thin ideal internalization, which in turn lead to body dissatisfaction (BD) and subsequently restrained eating and bulimic behaviours in both Australian and Malaysian women. Participants were 421 Australian and 399 Malaysian female emerging adults aged between 18 and 25 years, (M = 20.76; SD = 2.86) who completed questionnaires assessing sociocultural influences, thin ideal internalization, body dissatisfaction, restrained eating and bulimic behaviours. The model, largely supported in both cultures, had two points of difference. For Malaysian but not Australian women, family influence was significantly linked with internalization of the thin ideal. Although BD was significantly linked with restrained eating as predicted for Australian women (albeit rather weakly), it was not significantly linked with restrained eating for Malaysian women. The striking similarity of results across both cultures, suggests that Western body ideals, with their corresponding negative sequelae, have infiltrated the collectivist and developing nation of Malaysia.",Daily acute intermittent hypoxia induced dynamic changes in dendritic mitochondrial ultrastructure and cytochrome oxidase activity in the pre-Bötzinger complex of rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586594,Experimental neurology,2019 01 22,"Mitochondria, as primary energy generators and Ca2+ biosensor, are dynamically coupled to neuronal activities, and thus play a role in neuroplasticity. Here we report that respiratory neuroplasticity induced by daily acute intermittent hypoxia (dAIH) evoked adaptive changes in the ultrastructure and postsynaptic distribution of mitochondria in the pre-Bötzinger complex (pre-BötC). The metabolic marker of neuronal activity, cytochrome c oxidase (CO), and dendritic mitochondria were examined in pre-BötC neurons of adult Sprague-Dawley rats preconditioned with dAIH, which is known to induce long-term facilitation (LTF) in respiratory neural activities. We performed neurokinin 1 receptor (NK1R) pre-embedding immunocytochemistry to define pre-BötC neurons, in combination with CO histochemistry, to depict ultrastructural alterations and CO activity in dendritic mitochondria. We found that the dAIH challenge significantly increased CO activity in pre-BötC neurons. Darkly CO-reactive mitochondria at postsynaptic sites in the dAIH group were much more prevalent than those in the normoxic control. In addition, the length and area of mitochondria were significantly increased in the dAIH group, implying a larger surface area of cristae for ATP generation. There was a fine, structural remodeling, notably enlarged and branching mitochondria or tapered mitochondria extending into dendritic spines. Mitochondrial cristae were mainly in parallel-lamellar arrangement, indicating a high efficiency of energy generation. Moreover, flocculent or filament-like elements were noted between the mitochondria and the postsynaptic membrane. These morphological evidences, together with increased CO activity, demonstrate that dendritic mitochondria in the pre-BötC responded dynamically to respiratory plasticity. Hence, plastic neuronal changes are closely coupled to active mitochondrial bioenergetics, leading to enhanced energy production and Ca2+ buffering that may drive the LTF expression.",Chronic stress increases pain sensitivity via activation of the rACC-BLA pathway in rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586593,Experimental neurology,2019 01 22,"Exposure to chronic stress can produce maladaptive neurobiological changes in pathways associated with pain processing, which may cause stress-induced hyperalgesia (SIH). However, the underlying mechanisms still remain largely unknown. In previous studies, we have reported that the amygdala is involved in chronic forced swim (FS) stress-induced depressive-like behaviors and the exacerbation of neuropathic pain in rats, of which, the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) are shown to play important roles in the integration of affective and sensory information including nociception. Here, using in vivo multichannel recording from rostal anterior cingulate cortex (rACC) and BLA, we found that chronic FS stress (CFSS) could increase the pain sensitivity of rats in response to low intensity innoxious stimuli (LIS) and high intensity noxious stimuli (HNS) imposed upon the hindpaw, validating the occurrence of SIH in stressed rats. Moreover, we discovered that CFSS not only induced an increased activity of rACC neuronal population but also produced an augmented field potential power (FPP) of rACC local field potential (LFP), especially in low frequency theta band as well as in high frequency low gamma band ranges, both at the baseline state and under LIS and HNS conditions. In addition, by using a cross-correlation method and a partial directed coherence (PDC) algorithm to analyze the LFP oscillating activity in rACC and BLA, we demonstrated that CFSS could substantially promote the synchronization between rACC and BLA regions, and also enhanced the neural information flow from rACC to BLA. We conclude that exposure of chronic FS stress to rats could result in an increased activity of rACC neuronal population and promote the functional connectivity and the synchronization between rACC and BLA regions, and also enhance the pain-related neural information flow from rACC to BLA, which likely underlie the pathogenesis of SIH.",Protein stability: Determination of structure and stability of the transmembrane protein Mce4A from M. tuberculosis in membrane-like environment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586592,International journal of biological macromolecules,2019 05 31,"Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB), is an obligate pathogen that causes 10.4 million new infections worldwide, out of which about 1.4 million die every year. SDS is routinely used to mimic the native hydrophobic environment of phospholipid bilayer. Here, we report structure and stability of a mammalian cell entry protein from M. tuberculosis (Mce4A) in the absence and presence of SDS. The far-UV circular dichroism (CD) measurements suggested that SDS induces α-helical structure in Mce4A. Stability of the protein in the absence and presence of SDS was measured from the analysis of the urea-induced denaturation curves of three physical properties (CD, intrinsic fluorescence and near-UV absorption). These measurements led to the conclusion that SDS stabilizes Mce4A. Binding of SDS with Mce4A was measured in isothermal titration calorimeter, which led to the conclusion that there is strong binding of SDS with Mce4A. We propose that the membrane associated Mce4A is more structured and more stable.",Development of mutlifunctional nanoparticles self-assembled from trimethyl chitosan and fucoidan for enhanced oral delivery of insulin.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586591,International journal of biological macromolecules,2019 05 31,"Oral administration is a highly attractive approach for the delivery of protein drugs. However, oral protein therapeutics typically exhibit extremely poor bioavailability due to the harsh gastrointestinal (GI) environments and low permeability of protein across the intestinal barrier. Trimethyl chitosan (TMC) shows excellent mucoadhesive and absorption-enhancing properties while fucoidan (FD) has hypoglycemic effects and can prevent diabetes-related complications. Here we report, for the first time, that TMC combined with FD can be developed to a mutlifunctional nanoplatform for enhancing the transepithelial permeation of insulin through the intestinal epithelial cell barrier and inhibiting the α-glucosidase activity. TMC and FD self-assembled into spherical nanoparticles (NPs) for insulin encapsulation. TMC/FD NPs protected insulin against degradation by releasing insulin in a pH-dependent manner in the gastrointestinal tract fluids. The NPs were able to modulate the barrier function of the Caco-2 intestinal epithelial cell monolayer, and enhance paracellular transport of insulin across the intestinal barrier. TMC/FD NPs also showed α-glucosidase inhibitory activity, with an inhibition ratio of 33.2% at 2 mg/mL. The superior transepithelial absorption enhancing property of the TMC/FD NPs is expected to combine in the future with the functions of fucoidan against diabetes-related complications for development of advanced mutlifunctional therapeutic platforms for diabetes.",First evidence of formation of pre-molten globule state in myoglobin: A macromolecular crowding approach towards protein folding in vivo.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586590,International journal of biological macromolecules,2019 05 31,"Myoglobin is known to show formation of intermediate states under various environmental conditions, in spite of that, this is the first evidence of formation pre-molten globule (PMG) in myoglobin. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) of various molecular sizes shows assorted effects on different proteins. Out of too short and too long PEGs, only PEGs of optimal size interact with proteins leading to change in protein structure that form intermediate state. We are the first one to report the formation of PMG in a protein in the presence of a crowding agent. The PEG-induced intermediate state was characterized by various techniques like absorption, fluorescence, near- and far-UV circular dichroism spectroscopy, ANS binding, and dynamic light scattering measurements to be PMG. Isothermal titration calorimetry and docking studies were further carried out to delineate the mechanism of formation of PMG in myoglobin in physiological conditions. The intermediate formed due to interaction of PEG with myoglobin has physiological implications which are essential to unravel the mystery to solve the massively complicated problems involved in the proper folding of proteins in vivo. Further, outcomes from this study are expected to gain mechanistic insights on the native structure and functions of proteins under in vivo conditions.",Astragalus polysaccharide from Astragalus Melittin ameliorates inflammation via suppressing the activation of TLR-4/NF-κB p65 signal pathway and protects mice from CVB3-induced virus myocarditis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586589,International journal of biological macromolecules,2019 05 31,"Inflammation plays a crucial role in regulating cardiomyopathy and injuries of coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3)-induced viral myocarditis (VM). It has been reported that Astragalus polysaccharide (AP) from Astragalus Melittin could inhabit inflammatory gene expression under a variety of pathological conditions. However, the functional roles of AP in CVB3-induced VM still remain unknown. Here, we found that AP significantly enhanced survival for CVB3-induced mice. AP protected the mice against CVB3-induced myocardial injuries characterized by the increased body weight and depressed serum level of creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB), aspartate transaminases (AST) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), enhanced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and left ventricular fractional shortening (LVFS). At the pathological level, AP ameliorated the mice against CVB3-induced myocardial damage, dilated cardiomyopathy and chronic myocardial fibrosis. We subsequently found that AP significantly suppressed CVB3-induced expression of inflammation marker (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, INF-γ and MCP-1) in heart. Furthermore, we confirmed that AP suppressed the CVB3-induced expression of TLR-4 and phosphorylated NF-κB p65 in heart. Taken together, the data suggest that AP protects against CVB3-induced myocardial damage and inflammation, which may partly attribute to the regulation of TLR-4/NF-κB p65 signal pathway, moreover, suppressive effect of AP on CVB3-induced activation of TLR-4/NF-κB p65 signal was TNF-α-independent.","Physicochemical properties, antioxidant activity and in vitro gastrointestinal digestion of purified proteins from black cumin seeds.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586588,International journal of biological macromolecules,2019 05 31,"The main purpose of this work was to investigate some physiochemical and antioxidant properties of purified proteins of 18 kDa from black cumin seeds.

Obesity increases the risk of many chronic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease, and certain types of cancer, and is associated with lower life expectancy. The body mass index (BMI), which is currently used to classify obesity, is only an imperfect measure of abnormal or excessive body fat accumulation. Studies have shown that waist circumference as a measure of fat distribution may improve disease prediction. More elaborate techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging are increasingly available to assess body fat distribution, but these measures are not readily available in routine clinical practice, and health-relevant cut-offs not yet been established. The measurement of biomarkers that reflect the underlying biological mechanisms for the increased disease risk may be an alternative approach to characterize the relevant obesity phenotype. The insulin/insulin-like growth factor (IGF) axis and chronic low-grade inflammation have been identified as major pathways. In addition, specific adipokines such as leptin, adiponectin and resistin have been related to obesity-associated health outcomes. This biomarker research, which is currently further developed with the application of high throughput methods, gives important insights in obesity-related disease etiology and pathophysiological pathways and may be used to better characterize obese persons at high risk of disease development and target disease-causing biomarkers in personalized prevention strategies.",Molecular characterization of new genotypes Enterocytozoon bieneusi in Slovakia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586572,Acta tropica,2019 04 09,"Enterocytozoon bieneusi is characterized as a ubiquitous intestinal parasite with a wide genetic diversity, and it is capable of infecting a diverse range of hosts all around the world.

In this study we used PCR methods to examine 253 fecal samples from pigs, calves, sheep and goats with suspected microsporidiosis. Real time PCR was used to identify genotypes by amplification of SSU region and ITS region. After analysis we detected presence of E. bieneusi (7) and Microsporidia sp. (6) in 13 samples. The analysis of nucleotide sequences of ITS region of E. bieneusi shows, that the positive isolates belonged to 5 genotypes, including two known genotypes (I, F) and three new genotypes diagnosed in pigs, named SVK-S1, SVK-S2 and SVK-S3. Phylogenetic analysis showed that these novel genotypes identified in present study belong to group 1, which previously has been described as a zoonotic group.

In the present study, a new fluoroquinoline derivate, namely 7-chloro-N-(4-fluorophenethyl)quinolin-4-amine or GF1061, was evaluated regarding to its in vitro antileishmanial action against Leishmania infantum and L. amazonensis species, as well as by its toxicity in mammalian cells and efficacy in the treatment of infected macrophages. The mechanism of action of this molecule in L. amazonensis and the therapeutic efficacy in infected BALB/c mice were also evaluated. Results showed that GF1061 was effective against both parasite species, showing selectivity index (SI) of 38.7 and 42.7 against L. infantum and L. amazonensis promastigotes, respectively, and of 45.0 and 48.9 against the amastigotes, respectively. Amphotericin B (AmpB), used as control, showed SI values of 6.6 and 8.8 against L. infantum and L. amazonensis promastigotes, respectively, and of 2.2 and 2.7 against the amastigotes, respectively. The molecule was effective in treat infected macrophages, as well as it induced alterations in the mitochondrial membrane potential, increase in the reactive oxygen species production, and in the cell integrity of the parasites. Regarding to the in vivo experiments, BALB/c mice (n = 8 per group) were subcutaneously infected with 106L. amazonensis stationary promastigotes and, 60 days post-infection, they received saline or were treated during 10 days, once a day, with AmpB (1 mg/kg body weight) or GF1061 (5 mg/kg body weight). One day after the treatment, the infected tissue, spleen, liver, and draining lymph node (dLN) of the animals were collected, and the parasite load was evaluated. GF1061-treated mice, as compared to the saline and AmpB groups, showed significant reductions in the parasitism in the infected tissue (66% and 62%, respectively), liver (69% and 44%, respectively), spleen (71% and 38%, respectively), and dLN (72% and 48%, respectively). In conclusion, results suggested that GF1061 may be considered as a possible therapeutic target to be evaluated against leishmaniasis in other mammalian hosts.",Decomposing the constituent oscillatory dynamics underlying mismatch negativity generation in schizophrenia: Distinct relationships to clinical and cognitive functioning.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586570,International journal of psychophysiology : official journal of the International Organization of Psychophysiology,2019 01 18,"Abnormalities in early auditory information processing (EAIP) contribute to higher-order deficits in cognition and psychosocial functioning in schizophrenia. A passive auditory oddball paradigm is commonly used to evoke event-related potential (ERP) measures of EAIP reflecting auditory sensory registration and deviance detection, including mismatch negativity (MMN) and P3a responses. MMN and P3a have been extensively studied in healthy subjects and neuropsychiatric patient populations and are increasingly used as translational biomarkers in the development of novel therapeutics. Despite widespread use, relatively few studies have examined the constituent oscillatory elements and the extent to which sensory registration and deviance detection represent distinct or intercorrelated processes. This study aimed to determine the factor structure and clinical correlates of these oscillatory measures in schizophrenia patients (n = 706) and healthy comparison subjects (n = 615) who underwent clinical, cognitive, and functional characterization and EEG testing via their participation in the Consortium of Genomics in Schizophrenia (COGS-2) study. Results revealed significant deficits in theta-band (4-7 Hz) evoked power and phase locking in patients. Exploratory factor analyses of both ERP and oscillatory measures revealed two dissociable factors reflecting sensory registration and deviance detection. While each factor shared a significant correlation with social cognition, the deviance detection factor had a unique relationship to multiple cognitive and clinical domains.

Dunaliella sp. is known to have high levels of β-carotenes, which works as pro-vitamin A, enhancing the immune response in shrimp. However, the administration of Dunaliella sp. in shrimp diet needs to be evaluated to determine the appropriate dose and frequency of administration needed to optimize performance in cultured white shrimp. Diets with three different concentrations of Dunaliella sp. flour (1.5, 2 and 3%) were tested, and each one was administered at three different time frequencies: daily, and at 3- and 7-days intervals. Shrimp fed for 20 days were then infected with Vibrio parahaemolyticus (1 × 106 CFU/mL). Hemolymph parameters including protein, glucose, lactate, cholesterol and triglycerides were analyzed to evaluate shrimp stress status. Additionally, L. vannamei innate non-specific immune response was examined by evaluating the activity of prophenoloxidase (proPO), phenoloxidase (PO) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) in hemolymph; shrimp survival was also recorded. Survival after infection with V. parahaemolyticus was higher for shrimp fed with diets consisting of 2% Dunaliella sp. administered every 3 and 7 days. Shrimp fed a diet consisting of 2% or 3% Dunaliella sp. administered every third day showed positive physiological and immune responses to infection. A decrease in lipid oxidation in plasma triglycerides was observed at 48 h post inoculation in shrimp fed at all diets regimes due to Dunaliella sp. antioxidant action. Experimental results suggest the importance of Dunaliella sp. dosage and feeding frequency in L. vannamei diet to improve the survival and immune response.",Sleep deprivation-induced pre- and postsynaptic modulation of orexin neurons.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586566,Neuropharmacology,2019 05 31,"Sleep/wake states are controlled by sleep- and wake-promoting systems, and transitions between states are thought to be regulated by their reciprocal inhibition and homeostatic sleep need. Orexin neurons are known to promote wake maintenance and stabilize the sleep/wake switch. Thus, we asked whether orexin neurons are modulated by homeostatic sleep need. Rats were sleep deprived or left undisturbed to rest for 6 h, then acute brain slices were generated for patch clamp recordings. We found that sleep deprivation increased firing and reduced spike frequency adaptation in response to excitatory drive in orexin neurons. These changes were specific to D-type orexin neurons which, unlike H-type orexin neurons, lack A-type current. In D-type orexin neurons, sleep deprivation decreased afterhyperpolarizing potential, which was associated with increased gain, measured as the slope of the input-output relationship. These effects were mimicked by inhibition of SK channels. Furthermore, sleep deprivation resulted in presynaptic inhibition of excitatory inputs to both D-type and H-type orexin neurons, which preferentially affected sparse synaptic inputs while sparing high frequency synaptic activities. Taken together, our results indicate that sleep deprivation modulates the gain control and synaptic gating in orexin neurons. These pre-and postsynaptic changes would tune orexin neurons to strong wake-promoting excitatory signals, while dampening weak synaptic inputs to allow transition to sleep in the absence of such strong signals. These mechanisms are consistent with a role of orexin neurons not only as a key state stabilizer, but also as a homeostatic wake integrator in the sleep/wake switch.

In this study we evaluated the expression of secreted frizzled-related proteins (SFRPs) and their aberrant promoter methylation to investigate the involvement of epigenetic regulation in pulmonary fibrosis. The pulmonary fibrosis induced by intratracheal injection of bleomycin (BLM) into mice was adopted. The transcription and relative protein expression of SFRPs were detected at Day 7 (D7), D14, and D21. DNA methylation analysis was performed by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MSP). A DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitor (5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine; 5-aza) was used for demethylation and the relative β-catenin expression levels were measured to assess overactivity of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway. The transcription and protein expression of SFRP1 significantly decreased at D14 and D21, whereas the transcription and protein expression of SFRP4 significantly decreased at D7 and stayed downregulated until D21. The significantly hypermethylated promoters of SFRP1 and SFRP4 resulted in impaired transcription and decreased expression during pulmonary fibrosis in mice. Besides, reactivation of SFRP1 and SFRP4 by 5-aza reduced β-catenin mRNA and protein expression in vivo and in vitro. Animal experiments confirmed that 5-aza could significantly alleviate bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in mice. Thus, changes of promoter hypermethylation might downregulate SFRP1 and SFRP4 at different stages of pulmonary fibrosis, and the finding supports the usefulness of DNMT inhibitors, which might effectively reverse activation of β-catenin and reduce pulmonary fibrosis in mice. These data provide a possible new direction in the research on pulmonary fibrosis treatments.","Effects of maternal bisphenol A on behavior, sex steroid and thyroid hormones levels in the adult rat offspring.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586564,Life sciences,2019 03 01,"Bisphenol A (BPA), an endocrine disruptor used in industrial applications, has been detected in both placenta and milk.

To expand its clinical indications, 5/6-nephrectomised rats were used to mimic glomerular and vascular sclerosis and tubulointerstitial scarring, with subsequent progression towards end-stage renal disease. Adult Wistar rats underwent 5/6 nephrectomy to induce the development of chronic kidney disease, with a sham operation performed as a control. The nephrectomised animals were treated orally with either saline, nicousamide (7.5,15, or 45 mg/kg), benazepril (4 mg/kg), or losartan (10 mg/kg) daily for 20 weeks. At 8, 16, and 20 weeks of treatment, blood pressure was measured in each animal, and blood and urine samples were collected for biochemical analysis, while kidney remnants were collected for histological examination. Levels of fibronectin and transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β1) were measured in kidneys by immunohistochemistry. Renin activity in the plasma was measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The results showed that nicousamide treatment significantly reduced systemic hypertension, proteinuria, and blood urea nitrogen (P < 0.05), effectively alleviated glomerular sclerosis scores and tubulointerstitial injuries in a dose-dependent manner (P < 0.01), and markedly decreased fibronectin and TGF-β1 levels in kidney tissues of the 5/6-nephrectomised animals. In vitro studies suggested that nicousamide could moderately inhibit the renin activity and strongly block the TGF-β1 internalisation into fibroblast cells. In summary, nicousamide may protect from renal failure through dual targeting, which involves a TGF-β1-dependent mechanism and inhibition of renin activity.",Galantamine reversed early postoperative cognitive deficit via alleviating inflammation and enhancing synaptic transmission in mouse hippocampus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586550,European journal of pharmacology,2019 02 05,"Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is commonly seen in patients undergoing major surgeries and may persist. Although neuroinflammation is one of the important contributors to the development of POCD, the mechanisms underlying POCD remain unclear. We performed stabilized tibial fracture operation in male mice. In comparison with sham mice (anesthesia only), the surgery mice exhibited cognitive deficits in a fear conditioning paradigm at postsurgery day 3-7, and increased numbers of microglia and elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α) without change of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-4 and IL-10) in the hippocampus. Electrophysiological recordings from CA1 hippocampal neurons revealed that POCD mice exhibited impairment in AMPA receptor-mediated evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents (eEPSCs) without alteration in the rectification property of AMPA receptors. Interestingly, daily intraperitoneal administration of galantamine, an inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase, reversed cognitive dysfunction in surgery mice and attenuated accumulation of microglia and protein levels of IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α in the hippocampus. Additionally, galantamine potentiated AMPA receptor-mediated eEPSCs in the hippocampus more prominent in surgery mice than in sham mice. Therefore, enhancement of cholinergic tone in the hippocampus might be a therapeutic strategy for early POCD in terms of suppression of inflammation and normalization of excitatory synaptic transmission.",MiR-7-5p suppresses stemness and enhances temozolomide sensitivity of drug-resistant glioblastoma cells by targeting Yin Yang 1.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586549,Experimental cell research,2019 01 15,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most malignant tumor of the central nervous system, and chemoresistance blunts the effect of temozolomide (TMZ) in the treatment of GBM. Clarifying the underlying mechanism of chemoresistance might yield novel strategies to improve the patients' response to chemotherapeutics. Mounting evidence indicates that microRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in chemoresistance and tumorigenesis. At present, miR-7-5p has been recognized as a tumor suppressor involved in multiple cancers. However, the biological effects of miR-7-5p in TMZ resistance have not been illuminated. In this study, we used RNA sequencing and high-throughput screening techniques, which revealed that miR-7-5p is significantly downregulated in TMZ resistant LN229 cells (LN229/TMZ-R) compared to control cells (LN229), and low miR-7-5p expression was correlated with recurrence in GBM patients. Ectopic overexpression of miR-7-5p sensitized LN229/TMZ-R cells to TMZ and suppressed the stemness of glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs). Further experiments demonstrated that miR-7-5p exerts its role by directly targeting the 3'-untranslated region of Yin Yang 1 (YY1).

However, in July of 2018, the Food and Drug Administration released a statement cautioning women against vaginal rejuvenation devices and highlighted the paucity of long-term clinical research in this field. This statement may result in patients' hesitation to seek care for genitourinary syndrome of menopause. These recent events should be a call to action to urge physicians to address the barriers that exist in the treatment of genitourinary syndrome of menopause because of limited clinical research, cost of treatment, and fear.",Noradrenergic ensemble-based modulation of cognition over multiple timescales.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586547,Brain research,2019 03 17,"Cognition fluctuates over relatively faster and slower timescales. This is enabled by dynamic interactions among cortical neurons over similarly diverse temporal and spatial scales. Fast and slow cognitive processes, such as reorienting to surprising stimuli or using experience to develop a behavioral strategy, are also sensitive to neuromodulation by the diffusely-projecting brainstem noradrenergic nucleus, Locus Coeruleus. However, while a dynamic, multi-scale cortical ensemble code influences cognition over multiple timescales, it is unknown to what extent LC neuronal activity operates in this regime. An ensemble code within the LC may permit an interface with cortical ensembles allowing noradrenergic modulation of fast and slow cognitive processes. Alternatively, given that LC neurons are thought to spike synchronously, there may be a mismatch between LC and cortical neuronal codes that constrains how the noradrenergic system can influence cognition. We review new evidence that clearly demonstrates cell type-specific ensemble activity within LC occurring over a range of behaviorally-relevant timescales. We also review recent studies demonstrating that sub-sets of LC neurons modulate specific forebrain targets to control behavior. A critical target for future research is to study the temporal dynamics of projection-specific LC ensembles, their interactions with cortical networks, and the relevance of multi-scale coerular-cortical dynamics to behaviors over various timescales.",Brain-derived neurotrophic factor modified human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells-derived cholinergic-like neurons improve spatial learning and memory ability in Alzheimer's disease rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586546,Brain research,2019 03 22,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disease and the most common type of dementia. Although it is still incurable, stem cell replacement therapy provides new hope for AD. Human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hUC-MSCs) have multiple differentiation potentials, which can differentiate into cholinergic-like neurons and promote the release of acetylcholine. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) can also promote neurogenesis and synaptic formation, reduce oxidative stress and cell death. Therefore, we investigated the therapeutic effects of BDNF modified hUC-MSCs-derived cholinergic-like neurons in AD rats in this study. To make AD models, 1 μl beta amyloid (Aβ)1-42 was injected into the right hippocampus of the rats. After two weeks, the hUC-MSCs-derived cholinergic-like neurons null cells or overexpressing BDNF cells delivered by lentiviralvectors were slowly injected into the right hippocampus of the AD rats. After 8 weeks of transplantation, Morris water maze test, Western blotting, Immunohistochemistry, Immunofluorescence assay and TdT mediated dUTP Nick End Labeling (TUNEL) detection were performed. Transplantation of BDNF modified hUC-MSCs-derived cholinergic-like neurons significantly improved spatial learning and memory abilities in the AD rats, increased the release of acetylcholine and ChAT expression in the hippocampus, enhanced the activation of astrocytes and microglia, reduced the expression of Aβ and recombinant human beta-site APP-cleaving enzyme1 (BACE1), inhibited neuronal apoptosis, and promoted neurogenesis. Our results demonstrate that BDNF modified hUC-MSCs-derived cholinergic-like neurons might be a promising therapeutic strategy for AD.",A novel anti-cancer L19-interleukin-12 fusion protein with an optimized peptide linker efficiently localizes in vivo at the site of tumors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586544,Journal of biotechnology,2019 04 11,"Antibody-cytokine fusion proteins are a class of biopharmaceuticals, with the potential to modulate the activity of the immune system at the site of disease. The molecular format used to connect antibody moiety and cytokine payload can have a profound influence on biological activity and pharmacokinetic properties. The optimization of fusion protein format is particularly challenging for heterodimeric cytokines, since various molecular arrangements can be considered. In this article, we have explored the role of linker in a tumor-targeting IL12 fusion protein, based on the L19 antibody, specific to the extra-domain B of fibronectin. In biodistribution studies performed in tumor-bearing mice using radioiodinated protein preparations, fusion of human IL12 at the N-terminus of the L19 antibody in tandem-diabody format led to higher tumor uptake and improved tumor-to-organ ratios, compared to a similar fusion protein featuring L19 in IgG1 format. Moreover, optimization of the amino acid composition in eight variants of the linker connecting the IL12 moiety to the tandem-diabody revealed that a 15-amino acid linker (GSADGGSSAGGSDAG) displayed the best tumor targeting characteristics, with a long residence time at the tumor site and a rapid clearance from blood and normal organs. The product is being developed for industrial and clinical applications.",Novel fluoronucleoside analog NCC inhibits lamivudine-resistant hepatitis B virus in a hepatocyte model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586543,The Brazilian journal of infectious diseases : an official publication of the Brazilian Society of Infectious Diseases,2019 02 16,"Antiviral drug resistance is the most important factor contributing to treatment failure using nucleos(t)ide analogs such as lamivudine for chronic infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV). Development of a system supporting efficient replication of clinically resistant HBV strains is imperative, and new antiviral drugs are needed urgently to prevent selection of drug-resistant HBV mutants. A novel fluorinated cytidine analog, NCC (N-cyclopropyl-4'-azido-2'-deoxy-2'-fluoro-β-d-cytidine), was recently shown to strongly inhibit human HBV in vitro and in vivo. This study was designed to evaluate the antiviral activity of NCC against lamivudine-resistant HBV. We generated a stable cell line encoding the major pattern of lamivudine-resistant mutations rtL180M/M204V and designated it ""HepG2.RL1"". Immuno-transmission electron microscopic examination and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were used to detect secretion of HBV-specific particles and antigens. Quantification of extracellular DNA and intracellular DNA of HepG2.RL1 cells by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction revealed >625-fold and >5556-fold increases in the 50% inhibitory concentration of lamivudine, respectively, compared with that for the wild-type virus. The results showed that NCC inhibited DNA replication and HBeAg production in wild-type or lamivudine-resistant HBV in a dose-dependent manner. In conclusion, screening for antiviral compounds active against lamivudine-resistant HBV can be carried out with relative ease using hepG2.RL1 cells. NCC is a potential antiviral agent against wild-type HBV and clinical lamivudine-resistant HBV and deserves evaluation for the treatment of HBV infection.",Multiple Calcifying Hyperplastic Dental Follicles: A Case Report.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586542,Journal of oral and maxillofacial surgery : official journal of the American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons,2019 04 02,"Multiple calcifying hyperplastic dental follicles (MCHDFs) are a rare condition of calcification in the follicles of multiple impacted teeth.

We present a simple strategy for detecting a variety of bacterial species based on the interaction between bacterial cells and the viruses that infect them (phages). We engineer phage M13 to display the receptor-binding protein from a phage that naturally targets the desired bacteria. Thiolation of the engineered phages allows the binding of gold nanoparticles, which aggregate on the phages and act as a signal amplifier, resulting in a visible color change due to alteration of surface plasmon resonance properties. We demonstrate the detection of two strains of Escherichia coli, the human pathogens Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Vibrio cholerae, and two strains of the plant pathogen Xanthomonas campestris. The assay can detect ∼100 cells with no cross-reactivity found among the Gram-negative bacterial species tested here. The assay can be performed in less than an hour and is robust to different media, including seawater and human serum. This strategy combines highly evolved biological materials with the optical properties of gold nanoparticles to achieve the simple, sensitive, and specific detection of bacterial species.","Metabolic Engineering of Saccharomyces cerevisiae for Production of Shinorine, a Sunscreen Material, from Xylose.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586497,ACS synthetic biology,2019 02 15,"Shinorine, a mycosporine-like amino acid (MAA), is a small molecule sunscreen produced in some bacteria. In this study, by introducing shinorine biosynthetic genes from cyanobacteria Nostoc punctiform into Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we successfully constructed yeast strains capable of producing shinorine. Sedoheptulose 7-phosphate (S7P), an intermediate of the pentose phosphate pathway, is a key substrate for shinorine biosynthesis. To increase the S7P pool, xylose, which is assimilated via the pentose phosphate pathway, was used as a carbon source after introducing xylose assimilation genes from Scheffersomyces stipitis into the shinorine-producing strain. The resulting xylose-fermenting strain produced a trace amount of shinorine when cells were grown in glucose, but shinorine production was dramatically increased by adding xylose in the medium. Shinorine production was further improved by modulating the pentose phosphate pathway through deleting TAL1 and overexpressing STB5 and TKL1. The final engineered strain JHYS17-4 produced 31.0 mg/L (9.62 mg/g DCW) of shinorine in the optimized medium containing 8 g/L of xylose and 12 g/L of glucose, demonstrating that S. cerevisiae is a promising host to produce this natural sunscreen material.","Relationships between provider-led health plans and quality, utilization, and satisfaction.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586496,The American journal of managed care,2018 12 26,"To compare healthcare quality, utilization, and patient satisfaction between provider-led health plans (PLHPs) and non-PLHPs.",Cost variation and savings opportunities in the Oncology Care Model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586495,The American journal of managed care,2018 12 26,"This study seeks to identify service categories that present the greatest opportunities to reduce spending in oncology care episodes, as defined by the CMS Oncology Care Model (OCM).

Our research considers the impact of primary caregiver experiences of racial- and socioeconomic-based discrimination in early (age 3-5 years) and late childhood (age 9½) on adolescent disruptive behaviors (age 14) with a large sample of diverse caregiver-child dyads (N = 634). In addition, we examine the potential protective effects of parent-child relationship quality in early and late childhood in buffering the effects of caregiver discrimination on adolescent disruptive behaviors. We also explore possible gender differences in children's vulnerability to engage in disruptive behaviors in the context of caregiver experiences of discrimination. The findings from this study indicate that at trend level, early childhood experiences of primary caregiver discrimination (ages 3-5) predicted adolescent disruptive behaviors, accounting for the effects of more recent (age 9½) caregiver discrimination. In addition, parent-child relationship quality at age 9½ years was found to buffer the effects of late childhood (age 9½) primary caregiver discrimination on adolescent disruptive behaviors for both male and female youth. The findings highlight the need for prevention and intervention techniques that foster healthy and positive primary caregiver-child relationships.",A novel and innovative device to retract rectum during radiation therapy of pelvic tumors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586477,Journal of applied clinical medical physics,2019 05 17,"An effective radiotherapy treatment entails maximizing radiation dose to the tumor while sparing the surrounding and normal tissues. With the advent of SBRT with extreme hypo-fractionation in treating tumors including prostate where ablative dose is delivered in smaller number of fractions, rectum remains a dose-limiting organ and at the risk of rectal toxicity or secondary cancer. The same limitation of rectal toxicity exists for high-dose rate (HDR) treatments of cervical, endometrial, or prostate cancer when creating even a short distance between the anterior rectal wall and field of radiation is ideal in delivering ablative dose to the target. An effective solution to such problem is to physically displace rectum as the organ at risk. This research presents an organ retractor device that is designed to displace the rectum away from the path of radiation beam employing a Nitinol shape memory alloy that is designed for displacing the rectum upon actuation. A control system regulates the motion in a reproducible and safe manner by creating the desirable shape in moving the anterior rectal wall. The study finds the novel organ retractor device to be a promising tool that can be applied in a clinical setting for minimizing dose to the rectum during treatment of pelvic tumors, and creating the potential to deliver an ablative dose to tumor volume or to escalate the dose when needed.",Early-life risk for domestic violence perpetration: Implications for practice and policy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586476,Infant mental health journal,2019 01 16,"Research on risks and causes of domestic violence is hampered by a policy framework that not only does not fund but in some cases suppresses inquiry into those causes.

To fulfil the aim unstable radical originated in 1,2,3-propanetriol was trapped by PBN. Resulted spin adduct was measured using EPR spectroscopy and the isotropic hyperfine coupling constants aiso (14 N) and aiso (1 H) were obtained by simulation of the EPR spectrum. The next step consisted of conducting a comparative analysis of EPR parameters, based on the calculations conducted at the DFT and MP2 methods level in open-shell formalism including solvent effects. For comparison, calculations were also carried out at the level of combined methods (UB3LYP/QCISD and UMP2/QCISD) in terms of the ONIOM formalism. Comparison of the experimental EPR data of the isotropic hyperfine coupling constants aiso (14 N) and aiso (1 H) with the calculated parameters indicate that oxidation of 1,2,3-propanetriol leads to a carbon centred radical where unpaired electron is situated on the second (middle) carbon of 1,2,3-propanetriol.

This review takes a neurodevelopmental perspective on the very small group of males who grow up to become persistent violent offenders. After outlining six criteria for what constitutes a neurodevelopmental disorder, the extent to which chronic violence meets these definitional criteria is examined, covering the fields of genetics, structural and functional brain imaging, and neuropsychology. Early health risk factors for violence are then outlined, including birth complications, minor physical anomalies, prenatal smoking and alcohol exposure, poor nutrition, lead exposure, and traumatic brain injury. Persistent adult violence is argued to originate in aberrant temperamental behavior in early childhood, to have a stable developmental trajectory, and to be associated with impaired education, social, and occupational functioning. Taken together, it is argued that chronic adult violence meets criterion for being conceptualized as having neurodevelopmental origins and that an important, but not sole, source of neural maldevelopment lies in prenatal and early postnatal risk factors. This review concludes with a recognition of the sociopolitical context within which a neurodevelopmental perspective on chronic violence sits, together with directions for future research, including whether a neurodevelopmental hypothesis is best applied to reactive as opposed to proactive aggression.",Body Composition Technology: Implications for the ICU.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586471,Nutrition in clinical practice : official publication of the American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition,2019 03 20,"Malnutrition continues to be highly prevalent in hospitalized and critically ill patients and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality.

Two studies were conducted: in the first study, inter and intra coder reliability (dimension and category levels) and Generalizability theory analyzes were assessed, whilst in the second study, construct validity was tested with several hypotheses. The final instrument resulted in 20 categories with three dimensions: Conversational Act (7 categories), Therapeutic topic (6 categories) and Content (7 categories). The three dimensions showed excellent inter and intra coder reliability and the generalizability coefficients were excellent. Out of the 24 validity hypothesis proposed,19 were accepted.

Stability tests revealed that pMCR1_1943 was stably maintained with a stability frequency of 0.99±0.01 (mean ± standard deviation) after 880 generations in LB and 0.97±0.00 after 220 generations in M9 broth. Relative fitness (expressed as w, defined as relative fitness of the plasmid-carrying strain compared to the plasmid-free progenitor strain) was examined using the 24-h head to head competitions. pMCR1_1943 initially imposed costs (w, 0.88±0.03 in LB, 0.87±0.01 in M9) but such costs were largely reduced after 14-day cultures (w, 0.97±0.03 in LB, 0.95±0.03 in M9). The stable maintenance and the largely compensated cost after passage may contribute to the wide spread of mcr-1-carrying IncHI2 plasmids. To investigate potential mechanisms for the reduced fitness cost, we performed whole genome sequencing and single nucleotide polymorphism calling for the competitor strains. We identified that molecular chaperone-encoding dnaK, cell division protein-encoding cpoB and repeat protein-encoding rhsC were associated with the cost reduction for pMCR1_1943, which may represent new mechanisms for host bacterial strains to compensate fitness costs imposed by large plasmids and warrant further studies.",P38 MAPK inhibition prevents polybrene-induced senescence of human mesenchymal stem cells during viral transduction.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586456,PloS one,2019 05 21,"The unique capacity of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to migrate to the sites of damage, following intravenous transplantation, along with their proliferation and differentiation abilities make them promising candidates for MSC-based gene therapy. This therapeutic approach requires high efficacy delivery of stable transgenes to ensure their adequate expression in MSCs. One of the methods to deliver transgenes is via the viral transduction of MSCs. However, due to low transduction efficiency of MSCs, various polications are used to promote the association of viral particles with membranes of target cells. Among these polications polybrene is the most widely used one. Unfortunately, viral infection in presence of polybrene was shown to negatively affect proliferation rate of stem cells. The molecular mechanism underlying this effect is not yet uncovered. Therefore, the present study aimed to elucidate the mechanism of this phenomenon as well as to develop an effective approach to overcome the negative impact of polybrene on the properties of human endometrium-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hMESCs) during lentiviral infection. We found that the negative effect on proliferation observed during the viral infection in presence of polybrene is mediated by the polycation itself. Furthermore, we revealed that the treatment with polybrene alone led to the p38 MAPK-dependent premature senescence of hMESCs. These findings allowed us to develop an effective strategy to attenuate the negative polybrene impact on the hMESCs properties during lentiviral infection by inhibiting the activity of p38 MAPK. Importantly, the proposed approach did not attenuate the transduction efficiency of hMESCs, yet prevented polybrene-induced senescence and thereby restored the proliferation of the infected cells.

Despite its relevance for the global cycling of carbon and silica, many species are still described only morphologically, and numerous specimens do not fit any described taxa. Nowadays, studies to assess plankton biodiversity deploy high throughput sequencing metabarcoding of the 18S rDNA V4 region, but to translate the gathered metabarcodes into biologically meaningful taxa, there is a need for reference barcodes. However, 18S reference barcodes for this important family are still relatively scarce. We provide 18S rDNA and partial 28S rDNA reference sequences of 443 morphologically characterized chaetocerotacean strains. We gathered 164 of the 216 18S sequences and 244 of the 413 28S sequences of strains from the Gulf of Naples, Atlantic France, and Chile. Inferred phylogenies showed 84 terminal taxa in seven principal clades. Two of these clades included terminal taxa whose rDNA sequences contained spliceosomal and Group IC1 introns. Regarding the commonly used metabarcode markers in planktonic diversity studies, all terminal taxa can be discriminated with the 18S V4 hypervariable region; its primers fit their targets in all but two species, and the V4-tree topology is similar to that of the 18S. Hence V4-metabarcodes of unknown Chaetocerotaceae are assignable to the family. Regarding the V9 hypervariable region, most terminal taxa can be discriminated, but several contain introns in their primer targets. Moreover, poor phylogenetic resolution of the V9 region affects placement of metabarcodes of putative but unknown chaetocerotacean taxa, and hence, uncertainty in taxonomic assignment, even of higher taxa.","Associations between multimorbidity, all-cause mortality and glycaemia in people with type 2 diabetes: A systematic review.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586451,PloS one,2019 05 21,Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a major health priority worldwide and the majority of people with diabetes live with multimorbidity (MM) (the co-occurrence of ≥2 chronic conditions).

Forty non-overweight (group A; body-mass index [BMI] < 25 kg/m2) and 40 overweight individuals (group B; BMI = 25-30 kg/m2), who underwent CCTA for coronary artery disease screening, were retrospectively and consecutively enrolled. A 64-slice CT scanner was used at 100-kVp tube voltage and 150-mA tube current, and images were reconstructed using IMR techniques. Image noise, attenuation at the aorta, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) at the proximal right and left main coronary arteries (pRCA and LMCA) were calculated. CCTA images were qualitatively evaluated using a four-point scale (1, poor; 4, excellent) and analyzed using a non-inferiority test with a pre-defined non-inferiority margin of -0.2. The mean CCTA radiation dose (Group A: 1.33 ± 0.02 mSv; Group B: 1.35 ± 0.10 mSv; p = 0.151) and mean aortic root CT attenuation values (Group A: 447.9 ± 81.6 HU; Group B: 439.5 ± 63.6 HU; p = 0.571) did not differ significantly between the two groups. The mean noise in groups A and B was 26.0 ± 4.8 HU and 29.2 ± 4.4 HU, respectively (p = 0.005). The noise reduction ratio in the groups, compared to filtered back projection, was 65.0% and 68.1%, respectively. The mean grade of image quality did not differ significantly (3.75 ± 0.04 vs. 3.71 ± 0.04, p = 0.478). Group B CCTA image quality was non-inferior (mean difference = -0.043, 95% CI = -0.162-0.077) to that of Group A.

Here, we theoretically and experimentally compare ground-referenced (RR) with differential recordings (DR). We analyze electrical activity in the rat cortex with these two methods. Compared with RR, DR reveals the importance of local phasic oscillatory activities and their coherence between cortical areas. Finally, we show that DR provides a more faithful assessment of functional connectivity caused by an increase in the signal to noise ratio, and of the delay in the propagation of information between two cortical structures.",Self-assembled micro-computed tomography for dental education.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586444,PloS one,2019 05 21,"This study used available or purchased equipment and an image reconstruction system developed by the college of dentistry to establish a basic self-assembled micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) system. Such a system would be suitable for teaching dental radiology to dental students. Specifically, it could help students to understand the principles governing dental cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) and provide graduate students with a system for scanning small samples (e.g., individual teeth) during the early stages of research. The self-assembled micro-CT system was constructed using a portable dental X-ray tube, an intraoral digital X-ray detector, a high-precision rotation stage, related bracket accessories, and a notebook computer. Reconstructed images and three-dimensional models of the maxillary right third molar were produced using the self-assembled micro-CT system and an advanced commercially available micro-CT system (Skyscan 2211). Subsequently, the reconstructed images and 3D models produced using the two systems were compared by two senior dentists to determine whether considerable visual differences could be observed. Finally, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) was used for quantitative analysis and to compare the systems. Although the self-assembled micro-CT system produced image boundaries that were not as sharp as those of Skyscan 2211, the images were nonetheless remarkably similar. In addition, the two micro-CT systems produced 3D models that were almost identical in appearance and root canal shape. Quantitative analysis revealed that Skyscan 2211 had produced a SNR that was superior to that of the self-assembled micro-CT system, with the difference ranging from 36.77% to 136.22%; enamel, which has a higher density, exhibited lower SNR differences, whereas dentin, which has a lower density, exhibited higher SNR differences. The self-assembled micro-CT system with a resolution of 36 μm was created using a portable dental X-ray tube and an intraoral digital X-ray detector. Although the scanning time was relatively long (~30 min to scan images of a tooth), the images were adequate in the preliminary stage of experiments. More importantly, students were afforded the opportunity to observe the process of assembling and disassembling each component of a micro-CT scanner and thereby achieve a more comprehensive understanding of the principles governing micro-CT and dental CBCT."

The present study explored whether people who endorse anthropomorphic God concepts hold different religious beliefs and engage in different religious practices than those who endorse abstract concepts. Adults of various religious affiliations (n = 275) completed a questionnaire that probed their beliefs about God, angels, Satan, Heaven, Hell, cosmogenesis, anthropogenesis, human suffering, and human misdeeds, as well as their experiences regarding prayer, worship, and religious development. Responses to the questionnaire were analyzed by how strongly participants anthropomorphized God in a property-attribution task. Overall, the more participants anthropomorphized God, the more concretely they interpreted religious ideas, importing their understanding of human affairs into their understanding of divine affairs. These findings suggest not only that individuals vary greatly in how they interpret the same religious ideas but also that those interpretations cohere along a concrete-to-abstract dimension, anchored on the concrete side by our everyday notions of people.","Heart diseases and echocardiography in rural Tanzania: Occurrence, characteristics, and etiologies of underappreciated cardiac pathologies.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586432,PloS one,2019 05 07,"Little is known about heart diseases and their treatment in rural sub-Saharan Africa.

Upon host cell contact the T3SS machinery-also named injectisome-assembles a pore complex/translocon within host cell membranes that serves as an entry gate for the bacterial effectors. Whether and how translocons are physically connected to injectisome needles, whether their phenotype is related to the level of effector translocation and which target cell factors trigger their formation have remained unclear. We employed the superresolution fluorescence microscopy techniques Stimulated Emission Depletion (STED) and Structured Illumination Microscopy (SIM) as well as immunogold electron microscopy to visualize Y. enterocolitica translocons during infection of different target cell types. Thereby we were able to resolve translocon and needle complex proteins within the same injectisomes and demonstrate that these fully assembled injectisomes are generated in a prevacuole, a PI(4,5)P2 enriched host cell compartment inaccessible to large extracellular proteins like antibodies. Furthermore, the operable translocons were produced by the yersiniae to a much larger degree in macrophages (up to 25% of bacteria) than in HeLa cells (2% of bacteria). However, when the Rho GTPase Rac1 was activated in the HeLa cells, uptake of the yersiniae into the prevacuole, translocon formation and effector translocation were strongly enhanced reaching the same levels as in macrophages. Our findings indicate that operable T3SS translocons can be visualized as part of fully assembled injectisomes with superresolution fluorescence microscopy techniques. By using this technology, we provide novel information about the spatiotemporal organization of T3SS translocons and their regulation by host cell factors.",Imaging and quantitative analysis of insecticide in mosquito net fibers using Time-of-Flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (ToF-SIMS).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586430,PloS one,2019 05 14,"Time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) analysis was used to qualitatively and quantitatively assess the distribution of permethrin insecticide on the surfaces and interiors of Olyset long-lasting insecticidal net (LLIN) fibers. Total insecticide content in LLINs has been established using many analytical methods. However, it is important to quantify the bioavailable portion residing on the fiber surfaces for incorporated LLINs. ToF-SIMS is a very surface sensitive technique and can directly image the spatial distribution of permethrin insecticide on the surface of Olyset fibers. Surface permethrin appeared as patchy deposits which were easily removed by acetone and reappeared after several days as interior permethrin migrated (bloomed) from the fiber interior. After a wash/incubation cycle, permethrin deposits were more diffuse and less concentrated than those on the as-received fibers. ToF-SIMS is particularly sensitive to detect the Cl- ion, which is the characteristic ion of permethrin. Ion implantation and quantification of dopants using SIMS is well established in the semiconductor industry. In this study, quantitative depth profiling was carried out using 35Cl- ion implantation to correlate secondary ion yield with permethrin concentration, yielding a limit of detection of 0.051 wt% for permethrin. In some cases, surface concentration differed greatly from the fiber interior (>1 μm below the surface). Two- and three-dimensional mapping of Cl at sub-micrometer resolution showed permethrin to be dissolved throughout the fiber, with about 2 vol% residing in disperse, high-concentration domains. This suggests that these fibers fall into the class of monolithic sustained-release devices. It is expected that ToF-SIMS can be a valuable tool to provide insight into the insecticide release behavior of other LLIN products, both current and future.",Reading habits contribute to the effects of display direction on product choice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586429,PloS one,2019 06 03,"It has been shown that people process assortment variety more efficiently in horizontal displays than in vertical displays, owing to human visual characteristics that favor the horizontal direction. Consequently, the number and variety of products chosen tends to increase when they are arranged horizontally. I show that this horizontal display advantage can be modulated by culture, especially writing and reading habits. When Japanese participants, who write and read text vertically as well as horizontally, chose products in horizontal and vertical displays, horizontal displays did not consistently increase the variety of products chosen. In other words, the horizontal display advantage was eliminated (Experiments 1A and 1B). However, when Japanese readers initially read horizontally, it led to a robust advantage for the horizontal display. Similarly, initial vertical reading resulted in a vertical display advantage (Experiments 2 and 3). These results suggest that horizontal displays are not always advantageous, and that optimal display direction for product choice is affected by reading habits.","Stormwater influences phytoplankton assemblages within the diverse, but impacted Sydney Harbour estuary.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586428,PloS one,2019 06 03,"Sydney Harbour is subjected to persistent stress associated with anthropogenic activity and global climate change, but is particularly subjected to pulse stress events associated with stormwater input during episodic periods of high rainfall. Photosynthetic microbes underpin metazoan diversity within estuarine systems and are therefore important bioindicators of ecosystem health; yet how stormwater input affects their occurrence and distribution in Sydney Harbour remains poorly understood. We utilised molecular tools (16S/18S rRNA and petB genes) to examine how the phytoplankton community structure (both prokaryotes and eukaryotes) within Sydney Harbour varies between high and low rainfall periods. The relative proportion of phytoplankton sequences was more abundant during the high rainfall period, comprising mainly of diatoms, an important functional group supporting increased productivity within estuarine systems, together with cyanobacteria. Increased spatial variability in the phytoplankton community composition was observed, potentially driven by the steepened physico-chemical gradients associated with stormwater inflow. Conversely, during a low rainfall period, the proportion of planktonic photosynthetic microbes was significantly lower and the persistent phytoplankton were predominantly represented by chlorophyte and dinoflagellate sequences, with lower overall diversity. Differences in phytoplankton composition between the high and low rainfall periods were correlated with temperature, salinity, total nitrogen and silicate. These results suggest that increased frequency of high-rainfall events may change the composition, productivity and health of the estuary. Our study begins to populate the knowledge gap in the phytoplankton community structure and substantial changes associated with transient environmental perturbations, an essential step towards unravelling the dynamics of primary production in a highly urbanised estuarine ecosystem in response to climate change and other anthropogenic stressors.",Do relationships between leaf traits and fire behaviour of leaf litter beds persist in time?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586427,PloS one,2019 06 03,"Wildland fires are a dominant disturbance on Earth. On the local scale, fire activity is also influenced by species-specific fire behaviour of leaf litter beds. Thus, researchers strive to identify plant functional traits governing fire behaviour. The currently accepted relationships between morphological characteristics of the individual particles, fuel bed structure and resulting fire behaviour have been established on freshly constructed leaf litter beds. To investigate to what degree these relationships are altered upon exposure of constructed leaf litter beds to outside weather conditions, a novel testing system was designed. It enables outdoor exposure of the constructed litter beds, their subsequent retrieval and fire behaviour testing without disturbing the sample structure. Two treatments were applied on seven monospecific leaf litters. ""Fresh treatment"" corresponded to the common practice of testing fire behaviour directly after fuel bed construction. In the ""settled treatment"" constructed fuel beds were exposed for 30 days to outside weather conditions before being tested. The ""settled treatment"" was designed to address physical changes in the fuel bed structure which occur due to repeated wetting of the fuel bed. Thus, to minimise the effects of decomposition and fragmentation, winter exposure was chosen. Within the ""fresh treatment"" previously established relationships between size, curl, bulk density and fire behaviour characteristics could be confirmed. In the ""settled treatment"" the majority of these relationships lost their significance. The ""settled treatment"" had significantly lower bulk density (BD), rate of spread, maximum flame height and maximum sand temperature at 1 cm depth; and significantly higher flaming duration and amount of unburned residues compared to the ""fresh treatment"". Species with low initial BD were more affected by the treatment than species with high initial BD. The abrupt change in the fire behaviour of some leaf litter beds and the loss of numerous relationships between morphological characteristics of the individual particles and fire behaviour characteristics upon settled treatment indicate that fast occurring changes in the fuel bed structure should be taken into consideration if we are to understand the relationships between functional traits and local fire activity.",Older adults with disability in extreme poverty in Peru: How is their access to health care?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586426,PloS one,2019 05 30,"Disability rates increase with age.

We investigated the sensory function of DA in the nudipleuran Pleurobranchaea californica, in which the central neural correlates of sensation and foraging behavior have been well characterized. Tyrosine hydroxylase-like immunoreactivity (THli), a signature of the dopamine synthetic pathway, was similar to that found in two other opisthobranchs and two pulmonates previously studied: 1) relatively few (<100) THli neuronal somata were observed in the central ganglia, with those observed found in locations similar to those documented in the other snails but varying in number, and 2) the vast majority of THli somata were located in the peripheral nervous system, were associated with ciliated, putative primary sensory cells, and were highly concentrated in chemotactile sensory organs, giving rise to afferent axons projecting to the central nervous system. We extended these findings by observing that applying a selective D2/D3 receptor antagonist to the chemo- and mechanosensory oral veil-tentacle complex of behaving animals significantly delayed feeding behavior in response to an appetitive stimulus. A D1 blocker had no effect. Recordings of the two major cephalic sensory nerves, the tentacle and large oral veil nerves, in a deganglionated head preparation revealed a decrease of stimulus-evoked activity in the former nerve following application of the same D2/D3 antagonist. Broadly, our results implicate DA in sensation and engender speculation regarding the foraging-based decisions the neurotransmitter may serve in the nervous system of Pleurobranchaea and, by extension, other gastropods."

Information on overlapping distributions of eastern and western sea lions is needed for management considerations. We analyzed >30,000 sightings collected from 2000-2014 of 2,385 sea lions that were branded as pups at 10 Alaskan rookeries to examine mesoscale (mostly <500km) spatial distribution, geographic range, and geographic population structure based on natal rookery, sex, and age during breeding and non-breeding seasons. Analyses of summary movement measures (e.g., natal rookery, sex, and age-class differences in spatial distribution and geographic range) indicate wide variation in rookery-specific movement patterns. Correlations between movement measures and population dynamics suggested movement patterns could be a function of density dependence. Animals from larger rookeries, and rookeries with slower population growth and lower survival, had wider dispersion than animals from smaller rookeries, or rookeries with high growth and survival. Sea lions from the largest rookery, Forrester Island, where survival and population trends are lowest, were the most widely distributed. Analysis of geographic population structure indicated that animals born in the eastern Aleutian Islands had the most distinct movements and had little overlap with other western sea lions. Northern Southeast Alaska, within the eastern stock, is the area of greatest overlap between stocks, and is important to western animals, especially those born in Prince William Sound. Detailed knowledge of distribution and movements of western sea lions is useful for defining recovery and population trend analysis regions that better reflect dispersion and population structure and provides valuable information to managers as critical habitat is re-evaluated and the location of the stock boundary reconsidered.",BRCA Challenge: BRCA Exchange as a global resource for variants in BRCA1 and BRCA2.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586411,PLoS genetics,2019 03 04,"The BRCA Challenge is a long-term data-sharing project initiated within the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH) to aggregate BRCA1 and BRCA2 data to support highly collaborative research activities.

Initially, reported variants in BRCA1 and BRCA2 available from public databases were integrated into a single, newly created site, www.brcaexchange.org. The purpose of the BRCA Exchange is to provide the community with a reliable and easily accessible record of variants interpreted for a high-penetrance phenotype. More than 20,000 variants have been aggregated, three times the number found in the next-largest public database at the project's outset, of which approximately 7,250 have expert classifications.

Ongoing work includes direct contact with national centers with access to BRCA1 and BRCA2 diagnostic data to encourage data sharing, development of methods suitable for extraction of genetic variation at the level of individual laboratory reports, and engagement with participant communities to enable a more comprehensive understanding of the clinical significance of genetic variation in BRCA1 and BRCA2.",Quantification of hydrogen production by intestinal bacteria that are specifically dysregulated in Parkinson's disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586410,PloS one,2019 05 06,"Oral administration of hydrogen water ameliorates Parkinson's disease (PD) in rats, mice, and humans. We previously reported that the number of putative hydrogen-producing bacteria in intestinal microbiota is low in PD compared to controls. We also reported that the amount of hydrogen produced by ingestion of lactulose is low in PD patients. The decreased hydrogen production by intestinal microbiota may be associated with the development and progression of PD. We measured the amount of hydrogen production using gas chromatography by seven bacterial strains, which represented seven major intestinal bacterial groups/genera/species. Blautia coccoides and Clostridium leptum produced the largest amount of hydrogen. Escherichia coli and Bacteroides fragilis constituted the second group that produced hydrogen 34- to 93-fold lower than B. coccoides. Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum and Atopobium parvulum constituted the third group that produced hydrogen 559- to 2164-fold lower than B. coccoides. Lactobacillus casei produced no detectable hydrogen. Assuming that taxonomically neighboring strains have similar hydrogen production, we simulated hydrogen production using intestinal microbiota that we previously reported, and found that PD patients produce a 2.2-fold lower amount of intestinal hydrogen compared to controls. The lower amount of intestinal hydrogen production in PD was also simulated in cohorts of two other countries. The number of hydrogen-producing intestinal bacteria may be associated with the development and progression of PD. Further studies are required to prove its beneficial effect.",Raman spectroscopy of a near infrared absorbing proteorhodopsin: Similarities to the bacteriorhodopsin O photointermediate.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586409,PloS one,2019 05 22,"Microbial rhodopsins have become an important tool in the field of optogenetics. However, effective in vivo optogenetics is in many cases severely limited due to the strong absorption and scattering of visible light by biological tissues. Recently, a combination of opsin site-directed mutagenesis and analog retinal substitution has produced variants of proteorhodopsin which absorb maximally in the near-infrared (NIR). In this study, UV-Visible-NIR absorption and resonance Raman spectroscopy were used to study the double mutant, D212N/F234S, of green absorbing proteorhodopsin (GPR) regenerated with MMAR, a retinal analog containing a methylamino modified β-ionone ring. Four distinct subcomponent absorption bands with peak maxima near 560, 620, 710 and 780 nm are detected with the NIR bands dominant at pH <7.3, and the visible bands dominant at pH 9.5. FT-Raman using 1064-nm excitation reveal two strong ethylenic bands at 1482 and 1498 cm-1 corresponding to the NIR subcomponent absorption bands based on an extended linear correlation between λmax and γC = C. This spectrum exhibits two intense bands in the fingerprint and HOOP mode regions that are highly characteristic of the O640 photointermediate from the light-adapted bacteriorhodopsin photocycle. In contrast, 532-nm excitation enhances the 560-nm component, which exhibits bands very similar to light-adapted bacteriorhodopsin and/or the acid-purple form of bacteriorhodopsin. Native GPR and its mutant D97N when regenerated with MMAR also exhibit similar absorption and Raman bands but with weaker contributions from the NIR absorbing components. Based on these results it is proposed that the NIR absorption in GPR-D212N/F234S with MMAR arises from an O-like chromophore, where the Schiff base counterion D97 is protonated and the MMAR adopts an all-trans configuration with a non-planar geometry due to twists in the conjugated polyene segment. This configuration is characterized by extensive charge delocalization, most likely involving nitrogens atoms in the MMAR chromophore.",Quantifying bee assemblages and attractiveness of flowering woody landscape plants for urban pollinator conservation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586408,PloS one,2019 05 30,"Urban and suburban landscapes can be refuges for biodiversity of bees and other pollinators. Public awareness of declining pollinator populations has increased interest in growing plants that provide floral resources for bees. Various publications and websites list ""bee-friendly"" plants, but such lists are rarely based on empirical data, nor do they emphasize flowering trees and shrubs, which are a major component of urban landscapes. We quantified bee visitation to 72 species of flowering woody landscape plants across 373 urban and suburban sites in Kentucky and southern Ohio, USA, sampling and identifying the bee assemblages associated with 45 of the most bee-attractive species. We found strong plant species effects and variation in seasonal activity of particular bee taxa, but no overall differences in extent of bee visitation or bee genus diversity between native and non-native species, trees and shrubs, or early-, mid-, and late-season blooming plants. Horticulturally-modified varieties of Hydrangea, Prunus, and Rosa with double petals or clusters of showy sterile sepals attracted few bees compared to related plants with more accessible floral rewards. Some of the non-native woody plant species bloomed when floral resources from native plants were scarce and were highly bee-attractive, so their use in landscapes could help extend the flowering season for bees. These data will help city foresters, landscape managers, and the public make informed decisions to create bee-friendly urban and suburban landscapes.",Modelling the structure of object-independent human affordances of approaching to grasp for robotic hands.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586407,PloS one,2019 05 06,"Grasp affordances in robotics represent different ways to grasp an object involving a variety of factors from vision to hand control. A model of grasp affordances that is able to scale across different objects, features and domains is needed to provide robots with advanced manipulation skills. The existing frameworks, however, can be difficult to extend towards a more general and domain independent approach. This work is the first step towards a modular implementation of grasp affordances that can be separated into two stages: approach to grasp and grasp execution. In this study, human experiments of approaching to grasp are analysed, and object-independent patterns of motion are defined and modelled analytically from the data. Human subjects performed a specific action (hammering) using objects of different geometry, size and weight. Motion capture data relating the hand-object approach distance was used for the analysis. The results showed that approach to grasp can be structured in four distinct phases that are best represented by non-linear models, independent from the objects being handled. This suggests that approaching to grasp patterns are following an intentionally planned control strategy, rather than implementing a reactive execution.","A survey of argasid ticks and tick-associated pathogens in the Peripheral Oases around Tarim Basin and the first record of Argas japonicus in Xinjiang, China.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586406,PloS one,2019 05 07,"Argasid ticks (Acari: Argasidae) carry and transmit a variety of pathogens of animals and humans, including viruses, bacteria and parasites. There are several studies reporting ixodid ticks (Acari: Ixodidae) and associated tick-borne pathogens in Xinjiang, China. However, little is known about the argasid ticks and argasid tick-associated pathogens in this area. In this study, a total of 3829 adult argasid ticks infesting livestock were collected at 12 sampling sites of 10 counties in the Peripheral Oases, which carry 90% of the livestock and humans population, around the Tarim Basin (southern Xinjiang) from 2013 to 2016. Tick specimens were identified to two species from different genera by morphology and sequences of mitochondrial 16S rRNA and 12S rRNA were derived to confirm the species designation. The results showed that the dominant argasid ticks infesting livestock in southern Xinjiang were Ornithodoros lahorensis (87.86%, 3364/3829). Ornithodoros lahorensis was distributed widely and were collected from 10 counties of southern Xinjiang. Argas japonicus was collected from Xinjiang for the first time. In addition, we screened these ticks for tick-associated pathogens and showed the presence of DNA sequences of Rickettsia spp. of Spotted fever group and Anaplasma spp. in the argasid ticks. This finding suggests the potential role for Argas japonicus as a vector of pathogens to livestock and humans.","""Our riches are our family"", the changing family dynamics & social capital for new migrant families in Australia.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586405,PloS one,2019 05 22,"Immigration from collectivist cultures to Western countries often results in loss of social capital and changing family dynamics leading to isolation and acculturative stress. This study explored the impact of social and cultural changes experienced by seven migrant communities residing in Greater Western Sydney, Australia. It deconstructed the role of local community and networks in their initial settlement in absence of traditional forms of community support. Data were collected through fourteen focus group discussions (164 participants). Five major themes emerged: (i) changing gender roles and women empowerment; (ii) sending money home; (iii) culture shock and increased intercultural conflict; (iv) change in lifestyle from collective to individual culture; and (v) role of extended community in mitigating culture shock. These findings suggest that community interventions aimed at improving cultural and social engagement of migrants employ social capital framework. This will ensure enhanced communication within migrant families and communities from different cultural and linguistic backgrounds.",Seasonal changes in diet and chemical defense in the Climbing Mantella frog (Mantella laevigata).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586404,PloS one,2019 06 06,"Poison frogs acquire chemical defenses from the environment for protection against potential predators. These defensive chemicals are lipophilic alkaloids that are sequestered by poison frogs from dietary arthropods and stored in skin glands. Despite decades of research focusing on identifying poison frog alkaloids, we know relatively little about how environmental variation and subsequent arthropod availability impacts alkaloid loads in poison frogs. We investigated how seasonal environmental variation influences poison frog chemical profiles through changes in the diet of the Climbing Mantella (Mantella laevigata). We collected M. laevigata females on the Nosy Mangabe island reserve in Madagascar during the wet and dry seasons and tested the hypothesis that seasonal differences in rainfall is associated with changes in diet composition and skin alkaloid profiles of M. laevigata. The arthropod diet of each frog was characterized into five groups (i.e. ants, termites, mites, insect larvae, or 'other') using visual identification and cytochrome oxidase 1 DNA barcoding. We found that frog diet differed between the wet and dry seasons, where frogs had a more diverse diet in the wet season and consumed a higher percentage of ants in the dry season. To determine if seasonality was associated with variation in frog defensive chemical composition, we used gas chromatography / mass spectrometry to quantify alkaloids from individual skin samples. Although the assortment of identified alkaloids was similar across seasons, we detected significant differences in the abundance of certain alkaloids, which we hypothesize reflects seasonal variation in the diet of M. laevigata. We suggest that these variations could originate from seasonal changes in either arthropod leaf litter composition or changes in frog behavioral patterns. Although additional studies are needed to understand the consequences of long-term environmental shifts, this work suggests that alkaloid profiles are relatively robust against short-term environmental perturbations.",Oscillatory dynamics in a discrete predator-prey model with distributed delays.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586403,PloS one,2019 05 06,"This work aims to discuss a predator-prey system with distributed delay.

Nociceptive sensitization is common following tissue damage, inflammation, and disease and serves to protect the affected area while it heals. Organisms can become sensitized to a range of noxious and innocuous stimuli, including thermal stimuli. The basic mechanisms underlying sensitization to warm or painfully hot stimuli have begun to be elucidated, however, sensitization to cold is not well understood. Here, we develop a Drosophila assay to study cold sensitization after UV-induced epidermal damage in larvae. Larvae respond to acute cold stimuli with a set of unique behaviors that include a contraction of the head and tail (CT) or a raising of the head and tail into a U-Shape (US). Under baseline, non-injured conditions larvae primarily produce a CT response to an acute cold (10°C) stimulus, however, we show that cold-evoked responses shift following tissue damage: CT responses decrease, US responses increase and some larvae exhibit a lateral body roll (BR) that is typically only observed in response to high temperature and noxious mechanical stimuli. At the cellular level, class III neurons are required for the decrease in CT, chordotonal neurons are required for the increase in US, and chordotonal and class IV neurons are required for the appearance of BR responses after UV. At the molecular level, we found that the transient receptor potential (TRP) channel brivido-1 (brv1) is required for these behavioral shifts. Our Drosophila model will allow us to precisely identify the genes and circuits involved in cold nociceptive sensitization.","The ""sphere of care"": A qualitative study of colorectal cancer patient and caregiver experiences of support within the cancer treatment setting.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586391,PloS one,2019 05 22,"Colorectal cancer is associated with considerable physical and psychosocial burden. Whilst social support is known to facilitate psychological adjustment to cancer, patients' and caregivers' experiences of social support within a treatment setting and their perceptions of the role of the treating team in providing this support is unknown. Specifically, there is a gap in the research that explores in detail who people affected by colorectal cancer consider to be supportive, and the function, timing and nature of this support, whilst receiving treatment. This study explored both patients' and caregivers' a) experiences of social support and how this relates to their experience of treatment; and b) what facilitates support in the treatment setting.",Development of the Wheelchair outcomes Assessment Tool for Children (WATCh): A patient-centred outcome measure for young wheelchair users.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586390,PloS one,2019 05 22,To develop a patient-centred outcome measure (PCOM) for use with children and young people accessing National Health Service (NHS) wheelchair and posture services.

Therefore, the purpose of this article was to systematically review the literature on the effects of single dose tDCS to improve muscle strength. A systematic literature search was conducted on PubMeb, ISI Web of Science, SciELO, and Scopus using search terms regarding tDCS and muscle strength. Studies were included in accordance with Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcomes, and Setting (PICOS) including criteria. Healthy men and women, strength training practitioners or sedentary were selected. The acute effects of single dose anode stimulus of tDCS (a-tDCS) and the placebo stimulus of tDCS (sham) or no interventions were considered as an intervention and comparators, respectively. Measures related to muscle strength were analyzed. To conduct the analyses a weighted mean difference (WMD) and the standardized mean difference (SMD) were applied as appropriate. A total of 15 studies were included in this systematic review and 14 in meta-analysis. Regarding the maximal isometric voluntary contraction (MIVC), a small effect was seen between tDCS and Sham with significant difference between the conditions (SMD = 0.29; CI95% = 0.05 to 0.54; Z = 2.36; p = 0.02). The muscular endurance measured by the seconds sustaining a percentage of MIVC demonstrated a large effect between tDCS and Sham (WMD = 43.66; CI95% = 29.76 to 57.55; Z = 6.16; p < 0.001), showing an improvement in muscular endurance after exposure to tDCS. However, muscular endurance based on total work showed a trivial effect between tDCS and Sham with no significant difference (SMD = 0.22; CI95% = -0.11 to 0.54; Z = 1.32, p = 0.19). This study suggests that the use of tDCS may promote increase in maximal voluntary contraction and muscular endurance through isometric contractions.",Conventional analysis of trial-by-trial adaptation is biased: Empirical and theoretical support using a Bayesian estimator.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586387,PLoS computational biology,2019 02 15,"Research on human motor adaptation has often focused on how people adapt to self-generated or externally-influenced errors. Trial-by-trial adaptation is a person's response to self-generated errors. Externally-influenced errors applied as catch-trial perturbations are used to calculate a person's perturbation adaptation rate. Although these adaptation rates are sometimes compared to one another, we show through simulation and empirical data that the two metrics are distinct. We demonstrate that the trial-by-trial adaptation rate, often calculated as a coefficient in a linear regression, is biased under typical conditions. We tested 12 able-bodied subjects moving a cursor on a screen using a computer mouse. Statistically different adaptation rates arise when sub-sets of trials from different phases of learning are analyzed from within a sequence of movement results. We propose a new approach to identify when a person's learning has stabilized in order to identify steady-state movement trials from which to calculate a more reliable trial-by-trial adaptation rate. Using a Bayesian model of human movement, we show that this analysis approach is more consistent and provides a more confident estimate than alternative approaches. Constraining analyses to steady-state conditions will allow researchers to better decouple the multiple concurrent learning processes that occur while a person makes goal-directed movements. Streamlining this analysis may help broaden the impact of motor adaptation studies, perhaps even enhancing their clinical usefulness.",Elevated pyrimidine dimer formation at distinct genomic bases underlies promoter mutation hotspots in UV-exposed cancers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586386,PLoS genetics,2019 03 04,"Sequencing of whole cancer genomes has revealed an abundance of recurrent mutations in gene-regulatory promoter regions, in particular in melanoma where strong mutation hotspots are observed adjacent to ETS-family transcription factor (TF) binding sites. While sometimes interpreted as functional driver events, these mutations are commonly believed to be due to locally inhibited DNA repair. Here, we first show that low-dose UV light induces mutations preferably at a known ETS promoter hotspot in cultured cells even in the absence of global or transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (NER). Further, by genome-wide mapping of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) shortly after UV exposure and thus before DNA repair, we find that ETS-related mutation hotspots exhibit strong increases in CPD formation efficacy in a manner consistent with tumor mutation data at the single-base level. Analysis of a large whole genome cohort illustrates the widespread contribution of this effect to recurrent mutations in melanoma. While inhibited NER underlies a general increase in somatic mutation burden in regulatory elements including ETS sites, our data supports that elevated DNA damage formation at specific genomic bases is at the core of the prominent promoter mutation hotspots seen in skin cancers, thus explaining a key phenomenon in whole-genome cancer analyses.",Comprehensive cross-disorder analyses of CNTNAP2 suggest it is unlikely to be a primary risk gene for psychiatric disorders.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586385,PLoS genetics,2019 04 02,"The contactin-associated protein-like 2 (CNTNAP2) gene is a member of the neurexin superfamily. CNTNAP2 was first implicated in the cortical dysplasia-focal epilepsy (CDFE) syndrome, a recessive disease characterized by intellectual disability, epilepsy, language impairments and autistic features. Associated SNPs and heterozygous deletions in CNTNAP2 were subsequently reported in autism, schizophrenia and other psychiatric or neurological disorders. We aimed to comprehensively examine evidence for the role of CNTNAP2 in susceptibility to psychiatric disorders, by the analysis of multiple classes of genetic variation in large genomic datasets. In this study we used: i) summary statistics from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC) GWAS for seven psychiatric disorders; ii) examined all reported CNTNAP2 structural variants in patients and controls; iii) performed cross-disorder analysis of functional or previously associated SNPs; and iv) conducted burden tests for pathogenic rare variants using sequencing data (4,483 ASD and 6,135 schizophrenia cases, and 13,042 controls). The distribution of CNVs across CNTNAP2 in psychiatric cases from previous reports was no different from controls of the database of genomic variants. Gene-based association testing did not implicate common variants in autism, schizophrenia or other psychiatric phenotypes. The association of proposed functional SNPs rs7794745 and rs2710102, reported to influence brain connectivity, was not replicated; nor did predicted functional SNPs yield significant results in meta-analysis across psychiatric disorders at either SNP-level or gene-level. Disrupting CNTNAP2 rare variant burden was not higher in autism or schizophrenia compared to controls. Finally, in a CNV mircroarray study of an extended bipolar disorder family with 5 affected relatives we previously identified a 131kb deletion in CNTNAP2 intron 1, removing a FOXP2 transcription factor binding site. Quantitative-PCR validation and segregation analysis of this CNV revealed imperfect segregation with BD. This large comprehensive study indicates that CNTNAP2 may not be a robust risk gene for psychiatric phenotypes.",On variational solutions for whole brain serial-section histology using a Sobolev prior in the computational anatomy random orbit model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586384,PLoS computational biology,2019 05 08,"This paper presents a variational framework for dense diffeomorphic atlas-mapping onto high-throughput histology stacks at the 20 μm meso-scale. The observed sections are modelled as Gaussian random fields conditioned on a sequence of unknown section by section rigid motions and unknown diffeomorphic transformation of a three-dimensional atlas. To regularize over the high-dimensionality of our parameter space (which is a product space of the rigid motion dimensions and the diffeomorphism dimensions), the histology stacks are modelled as arising from a first order Sobolev space smoothness prior. We show that the joint maximum a-posteriori, penalized-likelihood estimator of our high dimensional parameter space emerges as a joint optimization interleaving rigid motion estimation for histology restacking and large deformation diffeomorphic metric mapping to atlas coordinates. We show that joint optimization in this parameter space solves the classical curvature non-identifiability of the histology stacking problem. The algorithms are demonstrated on a collection of whole-brain histological image stacks from the Mouse Brain Architecture Project.",A likelihood approach to testing hypotheses on the co-evolution of epigenome and genome.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586383,PLoS computational biology,2019 02 26,"Central questions to epigenome evolution include whether interspecies changes of histone modifications are independent of evolutionary changes of DNA, and if there is dependence whether they depend on any specific types of DNA sequence changes. Here, we present a likelihood approach for testing hypotheses on the co-evolution of genome and histone modifications. The gist of this approach is to convert evolutionary biology hypotheses into probabilistic forms, by explicitly expressing the joint probability of multispecies DNA sequences and histone modifications, which we refer to as a class of Joint Evolutionary Model for the Genome and the Epigenome (JEMGE). JEMGE can be summarized as a mixture model of four components representing four evolutionary hypotheses, namely dependence and independence of interspecies epigenomic variations to underlying sequence substitutions and to underlying sequence insertions and deletions (indels). We implemented a maximum likelihood method to fit the models to the data. Based on comparison of likelihoods, we inferred whether interspecies epigenomic variations depended on substitution or indels in local genomic sequences based on DNase hypersensitivity and spermatid H3K4me3 ChIP-seq data from human and rhesus macaque. Approximately 5.5% of homologous regions in the genomes exhibited H3K4me3 modification in either species, among which approximately 67% homologous regions exhibited local-sequence-dependent interspecies H3K4me3 variations. Substitutions accounted for less local-sequence-dependent H3K4me3 variations than indels. Among transposon-mediated indels, ERV1 insertions and L1 insertions were most strongly associated with H3K4me3 gains and losses, respectively. By initiating probabilistic formulation on the co-evolution of genomes and epigenomes, JEMGE helps to bring evolutionary biology principles to comparative epigenomic studies.","Correction: Loss of the BMP Antagonist, SMOC-1, Causes Ophthalmo-Acromelic (Waardenburg Anophthalmia) Syndrome in Humans and Mice.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586382,PLoS genetics,2019 02 05,[This corrects the article DOI: 10.1371/journal.pgen.1002114.].

In-vitro bioassays pointed out that RA affected root growth and morphology, causing ROS burst, ROS scavengers activity inhibition and consequently, an alteration on cells organization and ultrastructure. In particular, RA-treatment (175 μM) caused strong vacuolization, alteration of mitochondria structure and function and a consistent ROS-induced reduction of their transmembrane potential (ΔΨm). These data suggested a cell energy deficit also confirmed by the metabolomic analysis, which highlighted a strong alteration of both TCA cycle and amino acids metabolism. Moreover, the increase in H2O2 and O2- contents suggested that RA-treated meristems underwent oxidative stress, resulting in apoptotic bodies and necrotic cells. Taken together, these results suggest that RA inhibits two of the main ROS scavengers causing high ROS accumulation, responsible of the alterations on mitochondrial ultrastructure and activity through ΔΨm dissipation, TCA-cycle alteration, cell starvation and consequently cell death on Arabidopsis seedlings. All these effects resulted in a strong inhibition on root growth and development, which convert RA in a promising molecule to be explored for further use in weed management.",Dosimetric evaluation of respiratory gated volumetric modulated arc therapy for lung stereotactic body radiation therapy using 3D printing technology.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586367,PloS one,2019 05 09,This study aimed to evaluate the dosimetric accuracy of respiratory gated volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) for lung stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) under simulation conditions similar to the actual clinical situation using patient-specific lung phantoms and realistic target movements.,Statistical resolutions for large variabilities in hair mineral analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586366,PloS one,2019 05 16,"Measuring biomaterials is usually subject to error. Measurement errors are classified into either random errors or biases. Random errors can be well controlled using appropriate statistical methods. But, biases due to unknown, unobserved, or temporary causes, may lead to biased conclusions. This study describes a verification method to examine whether measurement errors are random or not and to determine efficient statistical methods. A number of studies have dealt with associations between hair minerals and exposures such as health, dietary or environmental conditions. Most review papers, however, emphasize the necessity for validation of hair mineral measurements, since large variations can cause highly variable results. To address these issues, we answer the following questions: How can we ascertain the reliability of measurements?How can we assess and control the variability of measurements?How do we efficiently determine associations between hair minerals and exposures?How can we concisely present the reference values? Since hair minerals all have distinctive natures, it would be unproductive to examine each mineral individually to find significant and consistent answers that apply to all minerals. To surmount this difficulty, we used one simple model for all minerals to explore quantitative answers. Hair mineral measurements of six-year-old children were analyzed based on the statistical model. The analysis verified that most of the measurements were reliable, and their inter-individual variations followed two-parameter distributions. These results allow for sophisticated study designs and efficient statistical methods to examine the effects of various kinds of exposures on hair minerals.","Clonal analysis of HIV-1 genotype and function associated with virologic failure in treatment-experienced persons receiving maraviroc: Results from the MOTIVATE phase 3 randomized, placebo-controlled trials.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586365,PloS one,2019 04 24,"Detailed clonal phenotypic/genotypic analyses explored viral-escape mechanisms during maraviroc-based therapy in highly treatment-experienced participants from the MOTIVATE trials. To allow real-time assessment of samples while maintaining a blind trial, the first 267 enrolled participants were selected for evaluation. At failure, plasma samples from 20/50 participants (16/20 maraviroc-treated) with CXCR4-using virus and all 38 (13 maraviroc-treated) with CCR5-tropic virus were evaluated. Of those maraviroc-treated participants with CXCR4-using virus at failure, genotypic and phenotypic clonal tropism determinations showed >90% correspondence in 14/16 at Day 1 and 14/16 at failure. Phylogenetic analysis of clonal sequences detected pre-treatment progenitor CXCR4-using virus, or on-treatment virus highly divergent from the Day 1 R5 virus, excluding possible co-receptor switch through maraviroc-mediated evolution. Re-analysis of pre-treatment samples using the enhanced-sensitivity Trofile® assay detected CXCR4-using virus pre-treatment in 16/20 participants failing with CXCR4-using virus. Post-maraviroc reversion of CXCR4-use to CCR5-tropic occurred in 7/8 participants with follow-up, suggesting selective maraviroc inhibition of CCR5-tropic variants in a mixed-tropic viral population, not emergence of de novo mutations in CCR5-tropic virus, as the main virologic escape mechanism. Maraviroc-resistant CCR5-tropic virus was observed in plasma from 5 treated participants with virus displaying reduced maximal percent inhibition (MPI) but no evidence of IC50 change. Env clones with reduced MPI showed 1-5 amino acid changes specific to each V3-loop region of env relative to Day 1. However, transferring on-treatment resistance-associated changes using site-directed mutagenesis did not always establish resistance in Day 1 virus, and key 'signature' mutation patterns associated with reduced susceptibility to maraviroc were not identified. Evolutionary divergence of the CXCR4-using viruses is confirmed, emphasizing natural selection not influenced directly by maraviroc; maraviroc simply unmasks pre-existing lineages by inhibiting the R5 virus.

Following a standard protocol, nasal swabs and LRT aspirates were obtained from all of the study patients at the time of surgery or in the immediate postoperative period. One swab was used for culture in the microbiology laboratory, and a second swab was used for the Xpert SA Nasal Complete assay.

The ability to recognize and appropriately respond to a partner's signals will define a pair's ability to reproduce. Individual variation in responsiveness, by shaping the formation and maintenance of strong pair bonds, will ultimately influence an individual's reproductive output. Throughout the breeding period, female cowbirds (Molothrus ater) respond to male song displays using a vocalization known as the chatter. In this study, we investigated whether variation in chatters remained repeatable across years and predicted reproductive performance. A flock of cowbirds housed in a large aviary complex was observed during the spring of 2011 to 2012. We recorded courtship interactions, including singing behavior for males, and chatters and eggs laid by females. The rate with which females responded to song using chatters remained consistent across years, with some females predictably responding to more songs using chatters than others. During 2012, chattering predicted the number of eggs females laid and her paired status. Paired females were more likely to respond to songs with chatters, and there was a strong positive relationship between the number of eggs laid and the proportion of songs she responded to using chatters. Overall, these findings suggest that variation in female vocal behavior is associated with their reproductive success.","Walking along chromosomes with super-resolution imaging, contact maps, and integrative modeling.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586358,PLoS genetics,2019 03 29,"Chromosome organization is crucial for genome function.

Focusing on chromosomal regions that contribute to compartments, we discover distinct structures that, in spite of considerable variability, can predict whether such regions correspond to active (A-type) or inactive (B-type) compartments. Imaging through the depths of entire nuclei, we capture pairs of homologous regions in diploid cells, obtaining evidence that maternal and paternal homologous regions can be differentially organized. Finally, using restraint-based modeling to integrate imaging and Hi-C data, we implement a method-integrative modeling of genomic regions (IMGR)-to increase the genomic resolution of our traces to 10 kb.",Gene expression variation and parental allele inheritance in a Xiphophorus interspecies hybridization model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586357,PLoS genetics,2019 06 10,"Understanding the genetic mechanisms underlying segregation of phenotypic variation through successive generations is important for understanding physiological changes and disease risk. Tracing the etiology of variation in gene expression enables identification of genetic interactions, and may uncover molecular mechanisms leading to the phenotypic expression of a trait, especially when utilizing model organisms that have well-defined genetic lineages. There are a plethora of studies that describe relationships between gene expression and genotype, however, the idea that global variations in gene expression are also controlled by genotype remains novel. Despite the identification of loci that control gene expression variation, the global understanding of how genome constitution affects trait variability is unknown. To study this question, we utilized Xiphophorus fish of different, but tractable genetic backgrounds (inbred, F1 interspecies hybrids, and backcross hybrid progeny), and measured each individual's gene expression concurrent with the degrees of inter-individual expression variation. We found, (a) F1 interspecies hybrids exhibited less variability than inbred animals, indicting gene expression variation is not affected by the fraction of heterozygous loci within an individual genome, and (b), that mixing genotypes in backcross populations led to higher levels of gene expression variability, supporting the idea that expression variability is caused by heterogeneity of genotypes of cis or trans loci. In conclusion, heterogeneity of genotype, introduced by inheritance of different alleles, accounts for the largest effects on global phenotypical variability."

The present study used long-duration depuration (14 days) at controlled temperatures (10 or 22°C) and salinities (12, 16, or 20 mg/g). All depuration temperature-salinity combinations significantly reduced V. vulnificus counts, with greatest reductions seen in 12 mg/g, 10°C seawater (2.7-log CFU/g reduction) and in 20 mg/g, 22°C seawater (2.8-log reduction). Mesophilic vibrios dominated the overall microflora of freshly harvested oysters, whereas refrigerated storage selected for psychrotrophic bacteria ( Pseudomonas spp., Aeromonas spp., Shewanella spp., Psychrobacter spp.) as well as did depuration at 10°C ( Pseudoalteromonas spp., Shewanella spp., Vibrio spp.). Depuration at 22°C retained dominance of mesophilic vibrios, including pathogenic species, followed by Shewanella spp., Pseudoalteromonas spp., and Photobacterium spp. Although aerobic plate counts were lower in 22°C depurated oysters (5.0 log versus 6.0 log) compared with 10°C, depuration at 10°C offered greater V. vulnificus population reductions than depuration at 22°C. This advantage was only seen at 12 mg/g salinity, with no impact at 16 and 20 mg/g salinities. No depuration treatment reduced V. vulnificus counts to nondetectable levels.

We established a baseline model with Salmonella contamination data from 2010 to 2013 surveys of walnuts from California operations to estimate baseline prevalence and levels of Salmonella during preshelling storage and typical walnut processing stages, considered U.S. consumption data, and applied an adapted dose-response model from the Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Health Organization to evaluate risk of illness per serving and per year. Our baseline model predicted 1 case of salmonellosis per 100 million servings (95% confidence interval [CI], 1 case per 3 million to 1 case per 2 billion servings) of walnuts untreated during processing and uncooked by consumers, resulting in an estimated 6 cases of salmonellosis per year (95% CI, <1 to 278 cases) in the United States. A minimum 3-log reduction treatment for Salmonella during processing of walnuts eaten alone or as an uncooked ingredient resulted in a mean risk of <1 case per year. We modeled the impact on risk per serving of three atypical situations in which the Salmonella levels were increased by 0.5 to 1.5 log CFU per unit pretreatment during processing at the float tank or during preshelling storage or posttreatment during partitioning into consumer packages. No change in risk was associated with the small increase in levels of Salmonella at the float tank, whereas an increase in risk was estimated for each of the other two atypical events. In a fourth scenario, we estimated the risk per serving associated with consumption of walnuts with Salmonella prevalence and levels from a 2014 to 2015 U.S. retail survey. Risk per serving estimates were two orders of magnitude larger than those of the baseline model without treatment. Further research is needed to determine whether this finding reflects variability in Salmonella contamination across the supply or a rare event affecting a portion of the supply.","Effect of Chlorine-Induced Sublethal Oxidative Stress on the Biofilm-Forming Ability of Salmonella at Different Temperatures, Nutrient Conditions, and Substrates.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586327,Journal of food protection,2019 01 14,"The present study was conducted to evaluate the effect of chlorine-induced oxidative stress on biofilm formation by various Salmonella strains on polystyrene and stainless steel (SS) surfaces at three temperatures (30, 25 [room temperature], and 4°C) in tryptic soy broth (TSB) and 1/10 TSB. Fifteen Salmonella strains (six serotypes) were exposed to a sublethal chlorine concentration (150 ppm of total chlorine) in TSB for 2 h at the predetermined temperatures. The biofilm-forming ability of the Salmonella strains was determined in 96-well polystyrene microtiter plates by using a crystal violet staining method and on SS coupons in 24-well tissue culture plates. All tested strains of Salmonella produced biofilms on both surfaces tested at room temperature and at 30°C. Of the 15 strains tested, none (chlorine stressed and nonstressed) formed biofilm at 4°C. At 30°C, Salmonella Heidelberg (ID 72), Salmonella Newport (ID 107), and Salmonella Typhimurium (ATCC 14028) formed more biofilm than did their respective nonstressed controls on polystyrene ( P ≤ 0.05). At room temperature, only stressed Salmonella Reading (ID 115) in 1/10 TSB had significantly more biofilm formation than did the nonstressed control cells ( P ≤ 0.05). Salmonella strains formed more biofilm in nutrient-deficient medium (1/10 TSB) than in full-strength TSB. At 25°C, chlorine-stressed Salmonella Heidelberg (ATCC 8326) and Salmonella Enteritidis (ATCC 4931) formed stronger biofilms on SS coupons ( P ≤ 0.05) than did the nonstressed cells. These findings suggest that certain strains of Salmonella can produce significantly stronger biofilms on plastic and SS upon exposure to sublethal chlorine.",Hazard Identification and Characterization: Criteria for Categorizing Shiga Toxin-Producing Escherichia coli on a Risk Basis†.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586326,Journal of food protection,2019 01 14,"Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) comprise a large, highly diverse group of strains. Since the emergence of STEC serotype O157:H7 as an important foodborne pathogen, serotype data have been used for identifying STEC strains, and this use continued as other serotypes were implicated in human infections. An estimated 470 STEC serotypes have been identified, which can produce one or more of the 12 known Shiga toxin (Stx) subtypes. The number of STEC serotypes that cause human illness varies but is probably higher than 100. However, many STEC virulence genes are mobile and can be lost or transferred to other bacteria; therefore, STEC strains that have the same serotype may not carry the same virulence genes or pose the same risk. Although serotype information is useful in outbreak investigations and surveillance studies, it is not a reliable means of assessing the human health risk posed by a particular STEC serotype. To contribute to the development of a set of criteria that would more reliably support hazard identification, this review considered each of the factors contributing to a negative human health outcome: mild diarrhea, bloody diarrhea, and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). STEC pathogenesis involves entry into the human gut (often via ingestion), attachment to the intestinal epithelial cells, and elaboration of Stx. Production of Stx, which disrupts normal cellular functions and causes cell damage, alone without adherence of bacterial cells to gut epithelial cells is insufficient to cause severe illness. The principal adherence factor in STEC is the intimin protein coded by the eae gene. The aggregative adherence fimbriae adhesins regulated by the aggR gene of enteroaggregative E. coli strains are also effective adherence factors. The stx2a gene is most often present in locus of enterocyte effacement ( eae)-positive STEC strains and has consistently been associated with HUS. The stx2a gene has also been found in eae-negative, aggR-positive STEC that have caused HUS. HUS cases where other stx gene subtypes were identified indicate that other factors such as host susceptibility and the genetic cocktail of virulence genes in individual isolates may affect their association with severe diseases."

It has been associated with goblet cell metaplasia, as expression of TMEM16A is strongly up-regulated in cystic fibrosis and asthma during mucus hypersecretion. However, the possible role of TMEM16A for mucus production or mucus secretion remains obscure, and whether TMEM16A controls the function of intestinal goblet cells is entirely unknown. Basal mucus secretion in lungs occurs through low levels of ATP in the airway surface liquid. Here, we report for the first time that TMEM16A is essential for basal secretion of mucus in airways and intestine. Airway-ciliated and intestinal epithelial-specific knockout of TMEM16A ( TMEM16Aflox/floxFoxJ1, TMEM16Aflox/floxVil1) leads to accumulation of mucus in airway club (Clara) cells and intestinal goblet cells, respectively. Acute ATP-induced mucus secretion by airway club cells is inhibited when TMEM16A is knocked out in ciliated cells, possibly as a result of compromised release of prosecretory cytokines. Knockdown or inhibition of TMEM16A in human Calu3 airway epithelial cells indicates compromised IL-8 release. In intestinal goblet cells lacking expression of TMEM16A, mucus accumulates as a result of compromised ATP-induced secretion. In contrast, cholinergic mucus secretion by compound exocytosis is independent of TMEM16A. The data demonstrate a previously unrecognized role of TMEM16A for membrane exocytosis and describe a novel, ATP-driven pathway for intestinal mucus secretion. We conclude that ATP-dependent mucus secretion in both airways and intestine requires TMEM16A. The present results may form the basis for a novel, therapeutic approach for the treatment of mucus hypersecretion in inflammatory airway and intestinal disease.-Benedetto, R., Cabrita, I., Schreiber, R., Kunzelmann, K.

A,2019 02 15,"The current paper reports a global investigation of all excited states below the ionic limit Fr+Na- of FrNa molecule following diabatic and adiabatic representations. The adiabatic and diabatic potential energy curves (PECs) for Σ+, Π, and Δ symmetries have been calculated for a dense grid of internuclear distances. The transition and permanent dipole moments (TDM and PDM) have been reported for both representations. Regarding the pseudopotential approach and full valence configuration interaction (FCI), the ab initio computation has been performed. Furthermore, the diabatization method was achieved by the use of the variational effective Hamiltonian theory (VEH). This latter served to assess the nonadiabatic coupling between the treated adiabatic states and to eliminate it employing a suitable unitary transformation matrix. The detailed computation of the PECs and PDM and TDM curves of the ground and excited states play a key role to coordinate experimental efforts in order to create cold and ultracold molecules in their ground stable rovibrational levels.",Role of pH in Aerosol Processes and Measurement Challenges.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586311,The journal of physical chemistry. A,2019 02 25,"pH is one of the most basic chemical properties of aqueous solution, but its measurement in nanoscale aerosol particles presents many challenges. The pH of aerosol particles is of growing interest in the atmospheric chemistry community because of its demonstrated effects on heterogeneous chemistry and human health, as well as potential effects on climate. The authors have shown that phase transitions of aerosol particles are sensitive to pH, focusing on systems that undergo liquid-liquid phase separation. Currently, aerosol pH is calculated indirectly from knowledge of species present in the gas and aerosol phases through the use of thermodynamic models. From these models, ambient aerosol is expected to be highly acidic (pH ∼ 0-3). Direct measurements have focused on model systems due to the difficulty of this measurement. This area is one in which physical chemists should be encouraged to contribute because of the potential consequences for aerosol processes in the environment.",Total Synthesis of the Antidiabetic (Type 2) Lipid Mediator Protectin DX/PDX.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586310,The Journal of organic chemistry,2019 04 16,"The first total synthesis of a lipid mediator derived from natural ω-3-fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), 10 S,17 S-diHDHA (also referred to as protectin DX/PDX), was achieved in a convergent route (29 steps).

The two stereodefined E-double bonds were generated by a Takai olefination, and the skipped diene side chain was introduced with a stereocontrolled Wittig olefination.

B,2019 04 15,"Understanding the mechanism of action of local anesthetics has been challenging. We previously showed that the local anesthetic phenylethanol (PEtOH) inhibits the function of serotonin1A receptor, which is a member of the G protein-coupled receptor family and a neurotransmitter receptor. With the objective of gaining insight into the molecular mechanism underlying the anesthetic (PEtOH) action, we monitored the organization and dynamics of hippocampal membranes using multiple fluorescent reporters, which include a molecular rotor (BODIPY-C12) and a voltage-sensitive probe (4-(2-(6-(dioctylamino)-2-naphthalenyl)ethenyl)-1-(3-sulfopropyl)-pyridinium inner salt) (di-8-ANEPPS), besides pyrene. These interfacial membrane probes were chosen because membrane partitioning of PEtOH would be reflected in the membrane interfacial environment. Taken together, we report a reduction in dipole potential and microviscosity of hippocampal membranes, with a concomitant increase in lateral diffusion in the presence of PEtOH. The reduction in membrane dipole potential induced by PEtOH constitutes one of the first experimental demonstrations on the modulation of membrane dipole potential by local anesthetics. Our results assume significance in view of previous reports that correlate membrane-perturbing effects of local anesthetics to their anesthetic action. We envision that insights into the interaction of local anesthetics with membranes could serve as a crucial link in developing a comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in anesthesia.",Statistical Learning of Discrete States in Time Series.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586307,The journal of physical chemistry. A,2018 12 26,"Time series obtained from time-dependent experiments contain rich information of kinetics and dynamics of the system under investigation. This work describes an unsupervised learning framework, along with the derivation of the necessary analytical expressions, for the analysis of Gaussian-distributed time series that exhibit discrete states. After the time series has been partitioned into segments in a model-free manner using the previously developed change-point (CP) method, this protocol starts with an agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithm to classify the detected segments into possible states. The initial state clustering is further refined using an expectation-maximization (EM) procedure, and the number of states is determined by a Bayesian information criterion (BIC). Also introduced here is an achievement scalarization function, usually seen in artificial intelligence literature, for quantitatively assessing the performance of state determination. The statistical learning framework, which is comprised of three stages---detection of signal change, clustering, and number-of-state determination---was thoroughly characterized using simulated trajectories with random intensity segments that have no underlying kinetics, and its performance critically evaluated. The application to experimental data is also demonstrated. The results suggested that this general framework, the implementation of which is based on firm theoretical foundations and does not require the imposition of any kinetics model, is powerful in determining the number of states, the parameters contained in each state, as well as the associated statistical significance.",Bath Gas Mixture Effects on Multichannel Reactions: Insights and Representations for Systems beyond Single-Channel Reactions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586306,The journal of physical chemistry. A,2019 02 15,"Nearly all studies of and available data for pressure-dependent reactions focus on pure bath gases. Of the comparatively fewer studies on bath gas mixtures, important to combustion and planetary atmospheres, nearly all focus on single-channel reactions. The present study explores, and seeks reliable representations of, bath gas mixture effects on multichannel reactions. Analytical and numerical solutions of the master equation here reveal several unique manifestations of mixture effects for multichannel reactions, including behavior completely opposite to trends observed for single-channel reactions. The most common way of evaluating mixture rate constants from data for pure components, the classic linear mixture rule, is found to yield errors exceeding a factor of ∼10. A new linear mixture rule based on the reduced pressure, instead of the absolute pressure, is found to be accurate within ∼30% for rate constants (and ∼50% for the branching ratio). A new nonlinear mixture rule that additionally incorporates analytically derived activity coefficients is found to be accurate within ∼10% for rate constants and branching ratios. These new mixture rules are therefore recommended for use in fundamental and applied chemical kinetics investigations of reacting mixtures, including reacting flow codes and experimental interpretations of third-body efficiencies.",Interaction between Acetic Acid and Glycerol: A Model for Secondary Reactions during Holocellulose Pyrolysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586305,The journal of physical chemistry. A,2019 02 15,"During pyrolysis of holocellulose, secondary reactions of the primary pyrolytic products inevitably occur, affecting the final pyrolytic product distribution. Carboxylic acids from primary pyrolysis process have significant interaction effects on both holocellulose and its pyrolytic products, whereas, the interaction mechanisms are still unclear. In the present study, acetic acid is selected as the typical carboxylic acid product, and glycerol is selected to represent the various hydroxyl-based compounds (both holocellulose and pyrolytic products such as anhydrosugars, etc.). The density functional theory (DFT) method is adopted to investigate the interaction mechanisms between them. Calculation results indicate that acetic acid and glycerol have strong interactions, with acetic acid acting as a catalyst for these interactions in two patterns. (I) Acetic acid enhances the dehydration reactions of glycerol with low energy barriers. (II) Acetic acid and glycerol undergo esterification to form an ester intermediate which then decomposes via various reactions. In addition, the decomposition of acetic acid can also be promoted by the catalysis of glycerol in a certain degree.

These unique features of the soft bioelectronics have allowed minimal mechanical and biological damage to organs and tissues integrated with bioelectronic devices and reduced side effects including inflammation, skin irritation, and immune responses even after long-term biointegration. These favorable properties for biointegration have enabled long-term monitoring of key biomedical indicators with high signal-to-noise ratio, reliable diagnosis of the patient's health status, and in situ feedback therapy with high treatment efficacy optimized for the requirements of each specific disease model. These advantageous device functions and performances could be maximized by adopting novel high-quality soft nanomaterials, particularly ultrathin two-dimensional (2D) materials, for soft bioelectronics. Two-dimensional materials are emerging material candidates for the channels and electrodes in electronic devices (semiconductors and conductors, respectively). They can also be applied to various biosensors and therapeutic actuators in soft bioelectronics. The ultrathin vertically layered nanostructure, whose layer number can be controlled in the synthesis step, and the horizontally continuous planar molecular structure, which can be found over a large area, have conferred unique mechanical, electrical, and optical properties upon the 2D materials. The atomically thin nanostructure allows mechanical softness and flexibility and high optical transparency of the device, while the large-area continuous thin film structure allows efficient carrier transport within the 2D plane. In addition, the quantum confinement effect in the atomically thin 2D layers introduces interesting optoelectronic properties and superb photodetecting capabilities. When fabricated as soft bioelectronic devices, these interesting and useful material features of the 2D materials enable unconventional device functions in biological and optical sensing, as well as superb performance in electrical and biochemical therapeutic actuations. In this Account, we first summarize the distinctive characteristics of the 2D materials in terms of the mechanical, optical, chemical, electrical, and biomedical aspects and then present application examples of the 2D materials to soft bioelectronic devices based on each aforementioned unique material properties. Among various kinds of 2D materials, we particularly focus on graphene and MoS2. The advantageous material features of graphene and MoS2 include ultrathin thickness, facile functionalization, large surface-to-volume ratio, biocompatibility, superior photoabsorption, and high transparency, which allow the development of high-performance multifunctional soft bioelectronics, such as a wearable glucose patch, a highly sensitive humidity sensor, an ultrathin tactile sensor, a soft neural probe, a soft retinal prosthesis, a smart endoscope, and a cell culture platform.

In recent years, the studies on stretchable materials have spread to various pivot components, such as electrodes, circuits, substrates, semiconductors, dielectric layers, membranes, and active nanocomposite films. The block copolymer (BC) elastomers have been playing considerable role in the development of stretchable materials. Since BCs are soft elastomers based on physical cross-links, they show differences in physical properties from normal elastomers formed with chemical cross-linking. BC elastomers does not require additional chemical cross-linking procedure, so they can be easily processed after dissolved in various solvents. Their viscoelasticity and thermoplasticity enable the BCs to become moldable and sticky. Although their unique physical properties may serve as disadvantages in some cases, they have been actively applied to create various stretchable electronic materials and their uses are expected to be enlarged more than ever. In this Account, we summarize recent successful applications of BCs for the stretchable electronic devices and discuss the possibility of further uses and the challenges to be addressed for practical uses. Studies on BC-based stretchable materials have focused initially on the fabrication process of stretchable conductors; mixing conductive fillers physically with BCs, infiltrating BCs in a conductive filler layer, and converting metal precursors into metal nanoparticles inside BCs. When conductive fillers with high aspect ratios, such as nanowires or nanosheets are used, the fillers can be infiltrated by the BCs after deposited. Since the contacts between the fillers are maintained during the infiltration process, even thin composite films possess high conductivity and stretchability. The metal precursor solution printing is suggested as a promising approach because it is compatible with traditional printing techniques without clogging the nozzles and allows high filler loading efficiency. When using a BC as a substrate, it is advisable to use a BC/PDMS double layer because of viscoelastic and thermoplastic properties of BCs. If BC/PDMS double layer is used with much thicker PDMS layer instead of viscoelastic BC alone, the double layer substrate can show a perfect elastomeric behavior, and the advantages of the BC substrate are preserved. Additionally, the use of conventional manufacturing techniques is important for commercialization of the stretchable devices. BC substrates having preformed microfibril network on their surfaces facilitate the fabrication of high-resolution circuitry by directly depositing metals through a mask on the substrate. Recent successes of fabricating stretchable organic transistors were obtained based on in situ phase separation of polymer semiconductors to form nanofibril bundles on the surface of a BC substrate. They have led to the achievement of high resolution transistor array printed in large area. BCs are expected to expand their applicability, including stretchable batteries, since they make it feasible to fabricate various hybrid nanocomposites, pore size-controlled membranes, and microstructured surfaces. However, it is necessary to secure long-term stability under heat, solvent, and UV; in addition, there is a need for the synthesis of functional BCs for use in stretchable implanted biomedical devices.",Reaction Packaging CoSe2 Nanoparticles in N-Doped Carbon Polyhedra with Bifunctionality for Overall Water Splitting.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586290,ACS applied materials & interfaces,2019 04 15,"Water electrolysis is a promising approach for green and large-scale hydrogen production; however, there are still challenges for developing efficient and stable bifunctional electrocatalysts toward the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions. Herein, zeolitic imidazolate framework-67 was used as the precursor for the construction of CoSe2 nanoparticles trapped in N-doped carbon (NC) polyhedra. Among as-obtained CoSe2-NC hybrid, highly active CoSe2 nanoparticles in sizes of 10-20 nm are encapsulated in N-doped few-layer carbon shell, avoiding their easy aggregations of CoSe2 nanoparticles as well as enhancing the long-term stability. The unique nanostructured CoSe2-NC hybrid with a hierarchical porosity and 3D conductive framework thus fully exerts outstanding bifunctional catalytic activity of CoSe2 centers. As a result, the CoSe2-NC hybrid as bifunctional catalysts for overall water splitting delivers a high current density of 50 mA cm-2 with an applied voltage of ∼1.73 V in an alkaline electrolyte, with a promising stability over 50 000 s.",Waveguide-Integrated Black Phosphorus Photodetector for Mid-Infrared Applications.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586289,ACS nano,2019 04 16,"Midinfrared (MIR), which covers numerous molecular vibrational fingerprints, has attracted enormous research interest due to its promising potential for label-free and damage-free sensing. Despite intense development efforts, the realization of waveguide-integrated on-chip sensing system has seen very limited success to date. The huge lattice mismatch between silicon and the commonly used detection materials such as HgCdTe, III-V, or II-VI compounds has been the key bottleneck that hinders their integration. Here, we realize an integration of silicon-on-insulator (SOI) waveguides with black phosphorus (BP) photodetectors. When operating near BP's cutoff wavelength where absorption is weak, the light-BP interaction is enhanced by exploiting the optical confinement in the Si waveguide and grating structure to overcome the limitation of absorption length constrained by the BP thickness. Devices with different BP crystal orientation and thickness are compared in terms of their responsivity and noise equivalent power (NEP). Spectral photoresponse from 3.68 to 4.03 μm was investigated. Additionally, power-dependent responsivity and gate-tunable photocurrent were also studied. At a bias of 1 V, the BP photodetector achieved a responsivity of 23 A/W at 3.68 μm and 2 A/W at 4 μm and a NEP less than 1 nW/Hz1/2 at room temperature. The integration of passive Si photonics and active BP photodetector is envisaged to offer a potential pathway toward the realization of integrated on-chip systems for MIR sensing applications.",Highly Sensitive Polarization Photodetection Using a Pseudo-One-Dimensional Nb(1- x)Ti xS3 Alloy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586287,ACS applied materials & interfaces,2019 04 15,"Low-symmetry layered two-dimensional (2D) materials with strong in-plane optical anisotropy can potentially be applied for polarization photodetection. This is especially true for those 2D materials with a direct band gap, which can efficiently absorb light with specific axial polarization. However, discovering such new anisotropic 2D materials with a direct band structure is still extremely challenging. Here, we fabricate a photodetector using a pseudo-one-dimensional (pseudo-1D) Nb(1- x)Ti xS3 alloy device and demonstrate that it is highly sensitive to the polarized light because of the strong in-plane optical anisotropy and direct band gap of the alloy by combining angle-resolved polarization Raman spectroscopy, azimuth-dependent reflectance difference microscopy, polarization-dependent absorption spectroscopy, and hybrid functional theory calculations. As a consequence, the polarization photodetector of the Nb(1- x)Ti xS3 alloy shows a large photocurrent anisotropic ratio and a high photoresponse. The choice of a low-symmetry layered pseudo-1D Nb(1- x)Ti xS3 alloy in polarization photodetection might open up new functionalities for novel optoelectronic device applications.",Understanding and Quantifying London Dispersion Effects in Organometallic Complexes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586286,Accounts of chemical research,2019 04 16,"Quantum chemical methods are nowadays able to determine properties of larger chemical systems with high accuracy and Kohn-Sham density functional theory (DFT) in particular has proven to be robust and suitable for everyday applications of electronic structure theory. A clear disadvantage of many established standard density functional approximations like B3LYP is their inability to describe long-range electron correlation effects. The inclusion of such effects, also termed London dispersion, into DFT has been extensively researched in recent years, resulting in some efficient and routinely used correction schemes. The well-established D3 method has demonstrated its efficiency and accuracy in numerous applications since 2010. Recently, it was improved by developing the successor (termed D4) which additionally includes atomic partial charge information for the generation of pairwise dispersion coefficients. These coefficients determine the leading-order (two-body) and higher-order (three- or many-body) terms of the D4 dispersion energy which is simply added to a standard DFT energy. With its excellent accuracy-to-cost ratio, the DFT-D4 method is well suited for the determination of structures and chemical properties for molecules of most kinds. While dispersion effects in organic molecules are nowadays well studied, much less is known for organometallic complexes. For such systems, there has been a growing interest in designing dispersion-controlled reactions especially in the field of homogeneous catalysis. Here, efficient electronic structure methods are necessary for screening of promising model complexes and quantifying dispersion effects. In this Account, we describe the quality of calculated structural and thermodynamic properties in gas-phase obtained with DFT-D4 corrected methods, specifically for organometallic complexes. The physical effects leading to London dispersion interactions are briefly discussed in the picture of second-order perturbation theory. Subsequently, basic theoretical aspects of the D4 method are introduced followed by selected case studies. Several chemical examples are presented starting with the analysis of transition metal thermochemistry and noncovalent interactions for small, heavy element containing main group compounds. Computed reaction energies can only match highly accurate reference values when all energy contributions are included in the DFT treatment, thus highlighting the major role of dispersion interactions for the accurate description of thermochemistry in gas-phase. Furthermore, the correlation between structural and catalytic properties is emphasized where the accessibility of high quality structures is essential for reaction planning and catalyst design. We present calculations for aggregates of organometallic systems with intrinsically large repulsive electrostatic interactions which can be stabilized by London dispersion effects. The newly introduced inclusion of atomic charge information in the DFT-D4 model robustly leads to quantitatively improved dispersion energies in particular for metallic systems. By construction it yields results which are easily understandable due to a clear separation into hybridization and charge (oxidation) state and two- and many-body effects, respectively. Due to its high computational efficiency, the D4 dispersion model is even applicable to low-cost classical and semiempirical theoretical methods.",Epitaxial Growth of Two-Dimensional Metal-Semiconductor Transition-Metal Dichalcogenide Vertical Stacks (VSe2/MX2) and Their Band Alignments.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586285,ACS nano,2019 04 16,"Two-dimensional (2D) metal-semiconductor transition-metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) vertical heterostructures play a crucial role in device engineering and contact tuning fields, while their direct integration still challenging. Herein, a robust epitaxial growth method is designed to construct multiple lattice-matched 2D metal-semiconductor TMDC vertical stacks (VSe2/MX2, M: Mo, W; X: S, Se) by a two-step chemical vapor deposition method. Intriguingly, the metallic VSe2 preferred to nucleate and extend from the energy-favorable edge site of the semiconducting MX2 underlayer to form VSe2/MX2 vertical heterostructures. This growth behavior was also confirmed by density functional theory calculations of the initial adsorption of VSe2 adatoms. In particular, the formation of Schottky-diode or Ohmic contact-type band alignments was detected for the stacks between VSe2 and p-type WSe2 or n-type MoSe2, respectively. This work hereby provides insights into the direct integration, band-alignment engineering, and potential applications of such 2D metal-semiconductor stacks in next-generation electronics, optoelectronic devices, and energy-related fields.",Tryptophan Metabolism in Caenorhabditis elegans Links Aggregation Behavior to Nutritional Status.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586284,ACS chemical biology,2019 03 29,"Caenorhabditis elegans uses aggregation pheromones to communicate its nutritional status and recruit fellow members of its species to food sources. These aggregation pheromones include the IC-ascarosides, ascarosides modified with an indole-3-carbonyl (IC) group on the 4'-position of the ascarylose sugar. Nothing is known about the biosynthesis of the IC modification beyond the fact that it is derived from tryptophan. Here, we show that C. elegans produces endogenously several indole-containing metabolites, including indole-3-pyruvic acid (IPA), indole-3-acetic acid (IAA; auxin), and indole-3-carboxylic acid, and that these metabolites are intermediates in the biosynthetic pathway from tryptophan to the IC group. Stable isotope-labeled IPA and IAA are incorporated into the IC-ascarosides. Importantly, we show that flux through the biosynthetic pathway is affected by the activity of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC). Knockdown of the PDC by RNA interference leads to an accumulation of upstream metabolites and a reduction in downstream metabolites in the pathway. Our results show that production of aggregation pheromones is linked to PDC activity and that aggregation behavior may reflect a favorable metabolic state in the worm. Lastly, we show that treatment of  C. elegans with indole-containing metabolites in the pathway induces the biosynthesis of the IC-ascarosides. Because the natural environment of C. elegans is rotting plant material, indole-containing metabolites in this environment could potentially stimulate pheromone biosynthesis and aggregation behavior in the worm. Thus, there may be important links between tryptophan metabolism in C. elegans and in plants and bacteria that enable interkingdom signaling.",Ag/CdO NP-Engineered Magnetic Electrochemical Aptasensor for Prostatic Specific Antigen Detection.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586282,ACS applied materials & interfaces,2019 04 09,"A simple magnetic electrochemical aptasensor was established for the detection of prostatic specific antigen (PSA). Ag/CdO nanoparticles (NPs) were fabricated and exhibited strong electroreduction peaks at -1.07 V, attributing to the electron transfer from Cd2+ to Cd0 and the superior electron transportation of Ag. Aptamer-modified Ag/CdO NPs were assembled on the surface of superparamagnetic Fe3O4/graphene oxide nanosheets (GO/Fe3O4 NSs) through the hydrophobic and π-π stacking interaction of aptamers and GO NSs. These assemblies possessed superior electroactive properties, efficient electron transfer, and superparamagnetic response and could serve as sensing units for PSA detection with the aid of a magnetic electrode. With increasing concentrations of PSA, the high affinity of aptamers to PSA enabled the dissociation of Ag/CdO NPs from GO/Fe3O4 NSs, decreasing the intensity of electroreduction peaks. The Ag/CdO NP-engineered magnetic electrochemical aptasensor achieved sensitive and accurate detection of PSA in the range of 50 pg/mL to 50 ng/mL. The limit of detection (LOD) was as low as 28 pg/mL. This developed protocol can be extended to a large set of strong electroactive labels for reliable tumor biomarker detection with high sensitivity and specificity.",Integrating Combinatorial Lipid Nanoparticle and Chemically Modified Protein for Intracellular Delivery and Genome Editing.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586281,Accounts of chemical research,2019 05 15,"The use of protein to precisely manipulate cell signaling is an effective approach for controlling cell fate and developing precision medicine. More recently, programmable nucleases, such as CRISPR/Cas9, have shown extremely high potency for editing genetic flow of mammalian cells, and for treating genetic disorders. The therapeutic potential of proteins with an intracellular target, however, is mostly challenged by their low cell impermeability. Therefore, a developing delivery system to transport protein to the site of action in a spatiotemporal controlled manner is of great importance to expand the therapeutic index of the protein. In this Account, we first summarize our most recent advances in designing combinatorial lipid nanoparticles with diverse chemical structures for intracellular protein delivery. By designing parallel Michael addition or ring-opening reaction of aliphatic amines, we have generated a combinatorial library of cationic lipids, and identified several leading nanoparticle formulations for intracellular protein delivery both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, we optimized the chemical structure of lipids to control lipid degradation and protein release inside cells for CRISPR/Cas9 genome-editing protein delivery. In the second part of this Account, we survey our recent endeavor in developing a chemical approach to modify protein, in particular, coupled with the nanoparticle delivery platform, to improve protein delivery for targeted diseases treatment and genome editing. Chemical modification of protein is a useful tool to modulate protein function and to improve the therapeutic index of protein drugs. Herein, we mostly summarize our recent advances on designing chemical approaches to modify protein with following unique findings: (1) chemically modified protein shows selective turn-on activity based on the specific intracellular microenvironment, with which we were able to protein-based targeted cancer therapy; (2) the conjugation of hyaluronic acid (HA) to protein allows cancer cell surface receptor-targeted delivery of protein; (3) the introduction of nonpeptidic boronic acid into protein enabled cell nucleus targeted delivery; this is the first report that a nonpeptidic signal can direct protein to subcellular compartment; and (4) the fusion of protein with negatively supercharged green fluorescent protein (GFP) facilitates the self-assembly of protein with lipid nanoparticle for genome-editing protein delivery. At the end of the Account, we give a perspective of expanding the chemistry that could be integrated to design biocompatible lipid nanocarriers for protein delivery and genome editing in vitro and in vivo, as well as the chemical approaches that we can harness to modulate protein activity in live cells for targeted diseases treatment."

This study aims to provide an overview of popular over-the-counter hair loss products and to review the available evidence regarding their use.
Methods: Top-selling hair loss products were identified using sales data from the online retailer Amazon.com. The active ingredients, consumer ratings, quantity, and price were collected for each product. A search of the literature was conducted for ingredients that frequently appeared on the top-seller list.
Results: Forty-two of the top 50 products met inclusion criteria, including orals (21.4%), topicals (35.7%), or shampoos/conditioners (42.9%). Common active ingredients included minoxidil, nutrients (ie, vitamins, minerals, proteins), and plant-based botanicals. 23.8% of products were FDA-approved treatments for androgenetic alopecia. Evidence for non-approved treatments is limited to small studies without generalizability.
Discussion: While some over-the-counter treatments may be efficacious, more rigorous study is required. Dermatologists should be equipped to discuss the efficacy of these therapies as well as the risks and benefits associated with their use with patients.

Design: This was a single-center, observational, open label, prospective clinical study. Ten healthy females (ages 30-70) with moderate signs of facial aging and moderate photodamage (hyperpigmentation and/or sun spots) were enrolled. Treatment consisted of topical twice-daily application of Melaclear serum, morning and evening, to the face and neck for 12 weeks. Efficacy assessments were conducted at weeks 4, 8, and 12. Standardized photographs, expert investigator grading, tolerability assessments, and subjects reported outcome measures were performed at all visits. Adverse events (AEs) were monitored throughout. Visual assessments of the face and neck included grading for radiance, smoothness, pigmentation, erythema, pore size, skin clarity, skin brightness, skin tone, luminosity, skin complexion, photodamage, hyperpigmentation, wrinkle severity, pigment via the modified Melasma Area and Severity Index (MASI), and overall global aesthetic improvement (GAIS). Safety and tolerability assessments included an evaluation of face and neck for stinging/burning by the subject and dryness, scaling, edema, and erythema by the treating investigator at all study visits.
Results: All enrolled subjects completed the study. At the 8 and 12-week follow up visit, there was a statistically significant improvement in the investigator GAIS (1.1 and 1.3, respectively) for the face from baseline. MASI scores were all statistically significantly reduced in the face from week 8 onward relative to baseline. In addition, all skin quality parameters assessed in the face significantly improved from baseline to week 12. Subject global aesthetic improvement scale scores (SGAIS) were also significantly improved at week twelve from baseline (1.8 change) as were skin quality assessments. The average rating for patient satisfaction was 2, or ""satisfied"" with the overall treatment effectiveness from week 4 onwards. For the neck none of the investigator or subject assessments improved significantly at any time point. No adverse events, tolerability events, or unexpected side effects were observed or reported for any of the subjects.
Conclusion: Twice a day treatment of women with moderate facial photoaging and hyperpigmentation with Melaclear serum can significantly improve skin quality, reduce the severity and intensity of hyperpigmentation, and improve signs of photodamage within 12 weeks without any side effects.

Whether PsO patients are more likely to suffer from gastrointestinal (GI) signs and symptoms has not been well-characterized. Understanding their prevalence in PsO patients may inform strategies to evaluate for GI signs and symptoms, screen for those at risk for IBD, and guide choice of therapy.
Objective: To assess the prevalence of GI signs and symptoms in patients with moderate-to-severe PsO.
Methods: An Internet-based survey was conducted to evaluate GI signs and symptoms in patients with self-reported moderate-to-severe PsO and non-PsO controls. The impact of PsO severity and presence of psoriatic arthritis (PsA) [self-reported and/or screened positive on the Psoriatic Arthritis Screening and Evaluation (PASE) questionnaire] on prevalence of GI signs and symptoms was also assessed. The survey included questions about PsO, comorbidities, demographics, and GI signs and symptoms. Questions related to GI signs and symptoms were used to calculate a modified CalproQuest* score to identify patients at increased risk for IBD.
Results: Survey responses were collected from 740 PsO patients and 1411 non-PsO controls. With the exception of age, demographics were generally comparable between groups. All six GI signs and symptoms assessed (belly pain, feeling full/bloated, diarrhea, mucus in stool, blood in stool, and unintentional weight loss) were more prevalent in PsO patients compared with non-PsO controls, and a higher proportion of PsO patients also had a positive CalproQuest* result. In addition, both more severe PsO and concomitant PsA were associated with a higher prevalence of GI signs and symptoms and a positive CalproQuest*.
Conclusions: This study suggests that PsO patients, including those with PsA, have a higher prevalence of GI signs and symptoms. Physicians should recognize and consider this concern in PsO patient management.

However, these do not consider changes in Body Surface Area (BSA). The IGAxBSA composite tool is a simple, effective, validated alternative for measuring improvement in psoriasis severity. It correlates well with the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) and demonstrates sensitivity to changes from baseline in patients with both mild and moderately severe disease.
Objective: To further define the role of a fixed combination halobetasol propionate 0.01% and tazarotene 0.045% (HP/TAZ) lotion in moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis using the IGAxBSA composite tool.
Methods: Post hoc analysis of 212 patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis randomized (2:2:2:1) to HP/TAZ lotion, HP, TAZ, or vehicle once-daily for 8 weeks, with a 4-week posttreatment follow-up. Efficacy assessments using the validated IGAxBSA composite tool.
Results: HP/TAZ lotion demonstrated statistically significant superiority at week 8 (versus TAZ and vehicle) and week 12 (versus HP, TAZ, and vehicle). By week 8, HP/TAZ lotion achieved a 63.5% reduction in mean IGAxBSA composite score (P<0.001 versus TAZ and vehicle), that was sustained four weeks posttreatment (P<0.001 versus TAZ and vehicle and P=0.003 versus HP). A 25% and 50% improvement in IGAxBSA was achieved within 1.9 and 4.6 weeks, respectively, and 47.5% of patients achieved IGAxBSA-75 by week 8.
Limitations: This post hoc analysis was limited to patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis with IGA ≥3 and BSA involvement (3%-12%).
Conclusions: HP/TAZ lotion was associated with significant and rapid reductions in disease severity as assessed by the IGAxBSA composite tool. The addition of tazarotene affords sustained benefits posttreatment.

Objective: To review the clinical studies with tazarotene in psoriasis and establish its future role in the management of this chronic, incurable condition.
Methods: An English language literature review was performed utilizing Medline, EMBASE, and the Web of Science to identify relevant articles, both clinical trials and reviews.
Results: Tazarotene is a very effective treatment for plaque psoriasis, with significant reductions in both plaque elevation and scaling after 12 weeks. Efficacy appears to be dose and formulation dependent, and erythema less responsive. Tazarotene sustains clinical response posttreatment and may have an important role in maintenance therapy.

These receptors have gained increased attention as therapeutic target for several CNS related neurological diseases. In the current study, we aimed to identify novel H3 R ligands using in silico virtual screening methods. To this end, a combination of ligand- and structure-based approaches was utilized for screening of ZINC database on the homology model of human H3 R. Structural similarity- and pharmacophore-based approaches were employed to generate compound libraries. Various molecular modeling methodologies such as molecular docking and dynamics simulation along with different drug likeness filtering criteria were applied to select anti-H3 R ligands as promising candidate molecules based on different known parent lead compounds. In vitro binding assays of the selected molecules demonstrated three of them being active within the micromolar and submicromolar Ki range. The current integrated computational and experimental methods used in this work can provide new general insights for systematic hit identification for novel anti-H3 R agents from large compound libraries.",Of Discomfort and Disagreement: Unclaimed Bodies in Anatomy Laboratories at United States Medical Schools.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586224,Anatomical sciences education,2019 01 22,"Use of unclaimed bodies for anatomy teaching in undergraduate medical education continues, but is ethically controversial. The purposes of this study were to estimate the proportion of United States (US) medical schools using unclaimed bodies in first-year anatomy laboratories, to determine whether schools inform students of this use, and to explore anatomy course leaders' attitudes toward unclaimed body use. Anatomy course leaders from 146 US medical schools that had independent preclinical programs including anatomy were surveyed. Survey results were analyzed with descriptive statistics and statistical tests of association. Free text responses were analyzed using a thematic editing style of qualitative content analysis. Of 89 responses (response rate, 61.0%), 11 schools (12.4%) reported possible use of unclaimed bodies. Course leaders from these schools reported greater comfort with using unclaimed bodies compared to leaders from other schools (P < 0.01). Although most course leaders (49/76, or 64.5%) believed it was important or very important to inform students about use of unclaimed bodies, respondents from schools where unclaimed bodies could be used were more neutral (P < 0.01). Qualitative findings revealed deep disagreement and contradictory views about how unclaimed body use relates to ethical principles of respect for persons and justice. Continued use of unclaimed bodies, varying levels of comfort with their use, and disagreement about the practices' underlying morality suggest a need for greater ethical reflection about the permissibility of unclaimed body use in clinical anatomy and for educational interventions that teach students about its history, ethics, and contemporary practice.",An Expert Derived Feedforward Histology Module Improves Pattern Recognition Efficiency in Novice Students.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586223,Anatomical sciences education,2019 01 22,"Histology is a visually oriented, foundational anatomical sciences subject in professional health curricula that has seen a dramatic reduction in educational contact hours and an increase in content migration to a digital platform. While the digital migration of histology laboratories has transformed histology education, few studies have shown the impact of this change on visual literacy development, a critical competency in histology. The objective of this study was to assess whether providing a video clip of an expert's gaze while completing leukocyte identification tasks would increase the efficiency and performance of novices completing similar identification tasks. In a randomized study, one group of novices (n = 9) was provided with training materials that included expert eye gaze, while the other group (n = 12) was provided training materials with identical content, but without the expert eye gaze. Eye movement parameters including fixation rate and total scan path distance, and performance measures including time-to-task-completion and accuracy, were collected during an identification task assessment. Compared to the control group, the average fixation duration was 13.2% higher (P < 0.02) and scan path distance was 35.0% shorter in the experimental group (P = 0.14). Analysis of task performance measures revealed no significant difference between the groups. These preliminary results suggest a more efficient search performed by the experimental group, indicating the potential efficacy of training using an expert's gaze to enhance visual literacy development. With further investigation, such feedforward enhanced training methods could be utilized for histology and other visually oriented subjects.",Atraumatic splenic rupture following IVIg for parvovirus B19 pure red cell aplasia post renal transplant.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586222,Transplant infectious disease : an official journal of the Transplantation Society,2019 05 02,Parvovirus B19 (PB19) associated pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) is an uncommon but well described complication of immunosuppression post solid organ transplantation.

A hallmark of ER stress is the accumulation of misfolded and unfolded proteins. Physiological levels of ER stress trigger the unfolded protein response (UPR) that is required to restore normal ER functions. However, the UPR can also initiate a cell death program/apoptosis pathway in response to excessive or persistent ER stress. Recently, it has become evident that chronic ER stress occurs in several diseases, including skin diseases such as Darier's disease, rosacea, vitiligo and melanoma; furthermore, it is suggested that ER stress is directly involved in the pathogenesis of these disorders. Here, we review the role of ER stress in skin function, and discuss its significance in skin diseases.",Persistent CD-19 depletion by rituximab is cost-effective in maintaining remission in calcineurin-inhibitor dependent podocytopathy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586217,"Nephrology (Carlton, Vic.)",2019 05 02,"A significant proportion of patients with minimal change disease (MCD) and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) are either steroid dependent or steroid resistant, requiring long-term calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) use.

Untangling the role of melatonin MT1 and MT2 receptors in sleep.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586215,Journal of pineal research,2019 03 07,"The pharmacological potential of targeting selectively melatonin MT1 or MT2 receptors has not yet been exploited in medicine. Research using selective MT1/MT2 receptor ligands and MT1/MT2 receptor knockout mice has indicated that the activation of MT2 receptors selectively increases non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep whereas MT1 receptors seem mostly implicated in the regulation of REM sleep. Moreover, MT1 knockout mice show an increase in NREM sleep, while MT2 knockout a decrease, suggesting an opposite role of these two receptors. A recent paper in mice by Sharma et al (J Pineal Res, 2018, e12498) found that MT1 but not MT2 receptors are expressed on orexin neurons in the perifornical lateral hypothalamus (PFH). Moreover, after injecting melatonin or luzindole into the mouse PFH, the authors suggest that melatonin promotes NREM sleep because activates PFH MT1 receptors, which in turn inhibit orexin neurons that are important in promoting arousal and maintaining wakefulness. In this commentary, we have critically commented on some of these findings on the bases of previous literature. In addition, we highlighted the fact that no conclusions could be drawn on the melatonin receptor subtype mediating the effects of melatonin on sleep because the authors used the non-selective MT1/MT2 receptors antagonist luzindole. More solid research should further characterize the pharmacological function of these two melatonin receptors in sleep."

It is well-established that response inhibition relies on the dopaminergic system in the basal ganglia. However, response inhibition is often measured imprecisely due to a process which slows our responses and increases subsequent inhibition success known as proactive inhibition. As the role of the dopamine system in proactive inhibition is unclear, we investigated the contribution of dopaminergic genes to proactive inhibition. We operationalised proactive inhibition as slower responses after failures to inhibit a response in a Go/No-Go paradigm and investigated its relationship to rs686/A at DRD1 (associated with increased gene expression) and rs1800497/T at DRD2 (associated with reduced D2 receptor availability). Even though our sample (N = 264) was relatively young (18-40 years), we found that proactive inhibition improves the ability to withhold erroneous responses in older participants (p = 0.002) and those with lower fluid intelligence scores (p < 0.001), indicating that proactive inhibition is likely a naturally occurring compensatory mechanism. Critically, we found that a polygenic risk score consisting of the number of rs686 A and rs1800497 T alleles predicts higher engagement of proactive inhibition (p = 0.040), even after controlling for age (p = 0.011). Furthermore, age seemed to magnify these genetic effects (p < 0.001). This suggests that the extent to which proactive inhibition is engaged depends on increased dopamine D1 and decreased D2 neurotransmission. These results provide important considerations for future work investigating disorders of the dopaminergic system.","Experimentally induced variation in neuroendocrine processes affects male reproductive behaviour, sperm characteristics and social interactions.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586201,Molecular ecology,2019 02 07,"While extensive research has focused on how social interactions evolve, the fitness consequences of the neuroendocrine mechanisms underlying these interactions have rarely been documented, especially in the wild. Here, we measure how the neuroendocrine mechanisms underlying male behaviour affect mating success and sperm competition in the ocellated wrasse (Symphodus ocellatus). In this species, males exhibit three alternative reproductive types. ""Nesting males"" provide parental care, defend territories and form cooperative associations with unrelated ""satellites,"" who cheat by sneaking fertilizations but help by reducing sperm competition from ""sneakers"" who do not cooperate or provide care. To measure the fitness consequences of the mechanisms underlying these social interactions, we used ""phenotypic engineering"" that involved administering an androgen receptor antagonist (flutamide) to wild, free-living fish. Nesting males treated with flutamide shifted their aggression from sneakers to satellite males and experienced decreased submissiveness by sneaker males (which correlated with decreased nesting male mating success). The preoptic area (POA), a region controlling male reproductive behaviours, exhibited dramatic down-regulation of androgen receptor (AR) and vasotocin 1a receptor (V1aR) mRNA following experimental manipulation of androgen signalling. We did not find a direct effect of the manipulation on male mating success, paternity or larval production. However, variation in neuroendocrine mechanisms generated by the experimental manipulation was significantly correlated with changes in behaviour and mating success: V1aR expression was negatively correlated with satellite-directed aggression, and expression of its ligand arginine vasotocin (AVT) was positively correlated with courtship and mating success, thus revealing the potential for sexual selection on these mechanisms.",Systematic approach to the correct identification of Asplenium dalhousiae (Aspleniaceae) with their medicinal uses.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586200,Microscopy research and technique,2019 05 01,"In present study, multiple microscope techniques were used for the systematics identification of the species Asplenium dalhousiae.

LM and SEM were used for the systematics identification of the species. Traditionally, the species is used in the ailment of many diseases, so the spore morphology, anatomical features, and morphological characters are relevant to describe the species taxonomy. The importance of multiple methods of taxonomic study (e.g., documentation and morphological characteristics) for characterizing herbs are important step in systematic certification to maintain the efficacy of herbal medicines.

We have previously shown an increase in the activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis in rats fed sucrose-rich diets (SRD). The main goal of this study was to analyze the processes involved in the modulation of the pituitary production of ACTH by SRD, and to test melatonin as a possible therapeutic agent for the prevention of the HPA axis dysfunction. Male Wistar rats were fed standard chow and either SRD (30% sucrose in the drinking water) or plain water for three weeks. Melatonin was administered as subcutaneous pellets. Results showed that SRD treatment induced an increase in systemic ACTH and corticosterone levels and a decrease in melatonin levels. In the pituitary gland, we also detected an increase in the expression levels of proopiomelanocortin (POMC) that was accompanied by increased levels of: lipoperoxides, nitro-tyrosine modified proteins, catalase, heme oxygenase-1, interleukin-1β mRNA, and by an increase in the tissue number of inflammatory cells (F4/80 and Iba-1 positive cells). Melatonin treatment prevented all these systemic and pituitary changes as well as the increase in POMC expression induced by incubation of AtT-20 corticotrophs with conditioned media obtained from stimulated macrophages. In conclusion, stimulation of POMC/ACTH production in rats fed a SRD could involve the generation of oxidative stress and inflammation in the pituitary gland. Melatonin treatment prevented these effects and normalized the activity of the HPA axis.",The pathological challenge of establishing a precise diagnosis for pulmonary tumour thrombotic microangiopathy: identification of new diagnostic criteria.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586197,Histopathology,2019 04 22,"Pulmonary tumour thrombotic microangiopathy (PTTM) is a fatal disease of patients with cancer that causes progressive pulmonary hypertension (PH).

In this study, we found melatonin could stimulate the synthesis of estradiol in pig GCs. The RNA-seq was used to explore the effects of melatonin on gene expression, a total of 89 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified. Gene ontology analysis showed DEGs which associated with regulation of cell proliferation, cell cycle, and anti-apoptosis were significantly enriched. The functions of two DEGs, NOTCH2 and FILIP1L, were studied in pig GCs. The results showed that NOTCH2 inhibited the synthesis of estradiol, but FILIP1L promoted the synthesis of estradiol. Furthermore, inhibiting NOTCH2 in granulosa cells cocultured with cumulus-oocyte-complexes had no obvious effect on the maturation of pig oocyte, but could upregulate the cleavage rate of oocyte. We proved that FILIP1L had no effect on the maturation and cleavage of pig oocytes. Our work deepens the understanding of melatonin's effects on GCs and oocyte. The DEGs we found will be beneficial to reveal mechanisms of melatonin acting on GCs and oocytes and design the pharmacological interventions.",Effects of thioTEPA chemotherapy on cognition and motor coordination.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586195,"Synapse (New York, N.Y.)",2019 04 10,"Cancer survivorship has increased greatly as therapies have become more advanced and effective. Thus, we must now focus on improving the quality of life of patients after treatment.

Male mice were given three intraperitoneal injections of thioTEPA. Five weeks later, the mice underwent behavior testing, and brains were collected for Golgi staining and cytokine analysis. Behavior tests included y-maze and Morris water maze and licking behavioral task. Cytokines measured include: IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, IL-12p70, MCP-1, TNF-α, GMCSF, and RANTES. We observed decreased memory retention in behavioral tasks. Also, dendritic arborization and length were decreased after chemotherapy treatment.

She argues that the transactional model fails to provide a secure foundation for the social value requirement, and then, appealing to John Rawls, she argues that a more secure foundation lies in the principles of social justice. Wenner's attempt to locate the source of the social value requirement raises important questions regarding its scope and strength. To determine what the social value requirement requires, we need to know why it's a requirement. Does the social value requirement apply to all trials or only to a subset? Is it a necessary condition on ethical research or an important consideration that can conflict with, and sometimes be defeated by, other considerations? Wenner's attempt to answer these questions is obscured by the fact that she mistakenly regards a minority view of research ethics as the mainstream view. Once we correct for that, her analysis of the foundation of the social value requirement provides a valuable opportunity to consider how the ethics of research as an institution might supplement or alter the ethics of individual clinical trials.",Wrestling with the Monster: Frankenstein and Organ Transplantation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586176,The Hastings Center report,2019 05 06,"In December 1967, Louis Washkansky, a grocer living in South Africa, became the first person to awaken after a heart transplant.

Sometimes, he was simply rude, rolling over and pretending to sleep in response to questions about his symptoms. When frustrated or convinced that his pain was not being addressed appropriately, he was prone to yelling and cursing at his nurses. After members of the health care team complained, their supervisor decided to transfer the patient to an adult general medicine service. Reasons cited for the transition included the stressful work environment created by the patient's actions, his refusal to follow directives from staff (although he was generally adherent to treatment), and the hypothetical harm to other young patients who might witness his behavior. Was this a just outcome? Is it ever permissible to deny access to pediatric care to a patient whose best interests would be served by it?

Transactional approaches understand social value obligations as arising from transactions (or relationships) between research subjects, investigators, sponsors, and other parties. The basic structure approach, by contrast, understands social value obligations as stemming from the demands of Rawlsian social justice. According to Wenner, ""The primary justification for the social value requirement lies not in the ethics of free and fair transactions but rather in the goals of the clinical research enterprise and the nature of its impacts on society. The requirement is justified because it ensures that biomedical progress occurs in a manner constrained by considerations of justice.""

What emerges from this translation is an economical, emotionally wrenching, and visually elegant drama of family tragedy from which we can draw a cautionary tale about contemporary bioethical dilemmas in family making that new and forthcoming biomedical technologies present. This performance of bodies interacting suggests the need for an ethics of acceptance and recognition as people navigate complex familial relationships involving procreative liberty, questions of moral personhood, and parental obligation. In the Frankenstein ballet, the narrative genre of dance-what I'll call ""story in the flesh""-invites viewers to identify with the characters and enter into the complexity of interpersonal relations.

Hepatologists worked in four practice settings: university hospital with a liver transplant (LT) program (UHLT, n = 148), non-university hospital with LT (nonUHLT, n = 35), university hospital with no LT (UHnoLT, n = 29), and community practice (CP, n = 17). The average number of patients seen monthly was lowest for hepatologists at a UHLT (154) and highest for those in CP (293). Hepatologists at LT programs saw the highest percentage of patients with liver disease (91% of encounters), performed the fewest endoscopic procedures (12%-17%), but received the highest compensation/RVU ($68-$85) compared with hepatologists at UHnoLT and CP ($44-$63/RVU). The mean base salary for all hepatologists with fewer than 5 years of experience was $273,507, and this increased to $347,656 for those with more than 5 years of experience. We concluded that hepatologists at LT centers are compensated at much higher rates per encounter than in other practice settings. This may be due to salary subsidies provided by the UHLT and nonUHLT to their hepatologists.",Staging laparoscopy among three subtypes of extra-hepatic biliary malignancy: a 15-year experience from 10 institutions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586170,Journal of surgical oncology,2019 02 01,Staging laparoscopy (SL) is used to avoid resection failure and thus increase the curative resection rate.

The presence of appropriate soil mutualists can act as a driver to enable plants to colonize new ranges. We reviewed the species of ectomycorrhizal fungi (EMF) that facilitate pine establishment in both native and non-native ranges, and that are associated with their invasion into nonforest settings. We found that one particular group of EMF, suilloid fungi, uniquely drive pine invasion in the absence of other EMF. Although the association with other EMF is variable, suilloid EMF are always associated with invasive pines, particularly at early invasion, when invasive trees are most vulnerable. We identified five main ecological traits of suilloid fungi that may explain their key role at pine invasions: their long-distance dispersal capacity, the establishment of positive biotic interactions with mammals, their capacity to generate a resistant spore bank, their rapid colonization of roots and their long-distance exploration type. These results suggest that the identity of mycorrhizal fungi and their ecological interactions, rather than simply the presence of compatible fungi, are key to the understanding of plant invasion processes and their success or failure. Particularly for pines, their specific association with suilloid fungi determines their invasion success in previously uninvaded ecosystems."

The axillary and the femoral sites are the most frequently used for arterial cannulation. There is no current evidence favoring one site over the other. We tested the hypothesis that the axillary and femoral arterial cannulation site may have different effects on left ventricular (LV) outflow. Seven patients with femoro-axillary ECLS and 4 patients with femoro-femoral ECLS were prospectively studied using the Pulse-wave Doppler (PWD) velocity time integral (VTI) in the descending thoracic aorta (DTA VTI) at different short-time variations of ECLS flow rates during the ECLS weaning process. The measurements were safe and feasible in all patients. We found a directly proportional correlation between DTA VTI and ECLS flow rate for femoro-axillary cannulation (P < 0.05) and an inversely proportional correlation in the case of femoro-femoral cannulation (P < 0.05). This is the first reported utilization of DTA VTI during ECLS that could improve our understanding of the LV-aorta interactions in patients with ECLS.

Since 2012, the PCORI has invested $177 million in patient-centered comparative effectiveness research (CER) that specifically targets the health needs of older adults, with additional relevant studies in its broader portfolio. Developing the PCORI's research portfolio has provided us with significant insights into what factors to consider when conducting CER in older adult populations. When comparing the net benefit of two or more interventions for older adults, investigators should consider the following: absolute risk difference, competing risks, life expectancy, the difference between chronologic and physiologic age, the importance of patient preferences, and other potential drivers of variable treatment effects. Investigators should also engage older adults and their caregivers as partners throughout the research process. Their input helps to identify key outcomes of interest and insights about the conduct of the research. As the PCORI continues to support research that addresses the healthcare decisions of the rapidly growing older adult population, it needs to partner with patients and researchers to identify the most important questions to address.

Both rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations ([CO2 ]) and temperatures have significant impacts on crop productivity, but the combined effects on grain quality are not well understood. We conducted an open-air field experiment to determine the impacts of elevated [CO2 ] (E-[CO2 ], up to 500 μmol mol-1 ) and warming (+2°C) on grain yield, protein and amino acid (AAs, acid digests) in a rice-winter wheat rotation system for 2 yr. E-[CO2 ] increased grain yield by 11.3% for wheat and 5.9% for rice, but decreased grain protein concentration by 14.9% for wheat and by 7.0% for rice, although E-[CO2 ] slightly increased the ratio of essential to nonessential AAs. With a consistent decline in grain yield, warming decreased protein yield, notably in wheat, despite a smaller increase in protein concentration. These results indicate that warming could partially negate the negative impact by E-[CO2 ] on grain protein concentration at the expense of grain yield; this tradeoff could not fully offset the negative effects of climate change on crop production.","Maternal cardiac function, uterine artery hemodynamics and natriuretic peptides at 22-24 weeks of gestation and subsequent development of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586148,Acta obstetricia et gynecologica Scandinavica,2019 03 12,"Maternal cardiac dysfunction as well as abnormal uterine artery (UtA) Doppler are associated with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP), but their relation is unclear.

This tutorial aims to explain the concepts behind data balancing to readers who do not have a strong statistical background. Data balancing enables the analyst to compare the performance of clinicians with their peer groups on the same set of patients. The comparison is done in 3 steps. First, the patients are described in terms of their conditions/comorbidities. Each combination of comorbidities is treated as a separate type of patient. Second, the analyst measures the frequency of observing different types of patients. Third, expected outcomes are calculated for both the clinician and the peer group. The expected outcome for the clinician is calculated as the sum of product of 2 terms: probability of and the average outcome for different types of patients. The expected outcome for the peer group is calculated in the same way, with one difference: the distribution of peer group's patients is switched with the distribution of the clinician's patients. This allows us to simulate the performance of peer group on the clinician's patients. This switch in frequencies accomplishes the same goal as using propensity weights, or covariate balancing weights, but it avoids the cumbersome need to estimate the weights. In switching the distributions, a problem arises when the peer group does not see the same type of patients as the clinician. When the peer group's outcome for some patient types is missing, a synthetic case is organized. These synthetic cases are constructed from the peer group's experience with 2 complementary parts of the missing case. The reliance on synthetic cases allows one to have a match for every type of clinician's patients. Together, the synthetic case and the switch of distribution allow one to simulate the performance of the clinician and the peer group on same set of cases. The tutorial walks the reader through examples. The procedures described here can be applied to data in electronic health records.

Therefore, for a full description of a person's health status, the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) was launched in 2001 to complement the existing International Classification of Diseases (ICD). The 11th version of the ICD (ICD-11) is based on so-called content models, which have 13 main parameters. One of them is functioning properties (FPs) that, according to the WHO, consist of the activities and participation components of the ICF. Recently, chronic pain codes were added to the 11th edition of the ICD, and hence, a specific set of FPs for chronic pain is required as a link to the ICF. In addition, pain is one of the 7 dimensions of the generic set of the ICF, which applies to any person. Thus, assessment and management of pain are also important for the implementation of the ICF in general. This article describes the current consensus proposal by the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) and the International Society of Physical and Rehabilitation Medicine (ISPRM) for a specific set of FPs of chronic pain, which will have to be empirically validated in a next step.

This system contains 1 code for ""chronic primary pain,"" where chronic pain is the disease, and 6 codes for chronic secondary pain syndromes, where pain developed in the context of another disease. This provides the opportunity for routine, standardised coding of chronic pain throughout all health care systems. In primary care, this will confer many important, novel advantages over current or absent coding systems. Chronic pain will be recognized as a centrally important condition in primary care. The capacity to measure incidence, prevalence, and impact will help in identification of human, financial, and educational needs required to address chronic pain in primary care.

Although comprising the most prevalent set of chronic pain conditions, it was not represented appropriately in the 10th edition of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10), which was organized mainly according to anatomical sites, was strongly focused on musculoskeletal disease or local damage, and did not consider the underlying mechanisms of pain. The new ICD-11 classification introduces the concept of chronic primary and secondary musculoskeletal pain, and integrates the biomedical axis with the psychological and social axes that comprise the complex experience of chronic musculoskeletal pain. Chronic primary musculoskeletal pain is a condition in its own right, not better accounted for by a specific classified disease. Chronic secondary musculoskeletal pain is a symptom that arises from an underlying disease classified elsewhere. Such secondary musculoskeletal pain originates in persistent nociception in musculoskeletal structures from local or systemic etiologies, or it may be related to deep somatic lesions. It can be caused by inflammation, by structural changes, or by biomechanical consequences of diseases of the nervous system. It is intended that this new classification will facilitate access to patient-centered multimodal pain management and promote research through more accurate epidemiological analyses."

However, optimal postoperative management of these patients remains uncertain, especially with regard to blood pressure control. To review the existing literature to define potential blood pressure goals in the immediate postoperative period in patients who undergo MT for acute ischemic stroke. The topic was defined through a clinical scenario and the subsequent development of a targeted clinical question. A literature search was performed, with relevant articles selected, one of which, a prospective observational study, was critically appraised. Participants included neurology residents and consultants, a medical librarian, clinical epidemiologists, as well as content experts from vascular neurology and interventional neuroradiology. Permissive hypertension (defined as <220/120 or <180/105 mm Hg as per the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association guidelines) may be harmful in the postoperative period following MT, especially in patients who were successfully recanalized. Moderate blood pressure control (<160/90) was found to be a predictor of improved 3-month mortality on multivariable logistic regression analysis in patients who sustained successful reperfusion [odds ratio (OR), 0.08; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.01-0.054; P=0.01]. A 10 mm Hg increase in systolic blood pressure was found to result in a lower OR of having a favorable 3-month functional independence (OR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.56-0.85; P=0.001) as well as higher rates of 3-month mortality (OR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.18-1.88; P=0.001). Blood pressure goals in the immediate postoperative period in patients who undergo MT should differ than those who do not undergo MT, with data suggesting that lower blood pressure than permissive hypertension may be related to improved outcomes, especially in cases of successful reperfusion. However, current data are derived from observational studies; further studies, preferably in the form of randomized-controlled trials, are needed to further clarify the relationship between postoperative blood pressures and outcomes in this patient population.","Rare Phenomenon of Limb-shaking TIA, Resolved With Intracranial Wingspan Stenting.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586034,The neurologist,2019 02 26,Illustrates the importance of differentiating limb-shaking transient ischemic attack (LS-TIA) from focal seizures and carefully selecting patients for intracranial stenting.,Radiologic and Histopathologic Features in an Intracranial Localized Castleman Disease: A Case Report and Review of Literature.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586033,The neurologist,2019 01 30,"Castleman disease (CD) is a rare pathologic process of unknown etiology, characterized by non-neoplastic lymph node enlargement.

The research field of anatomical modeling for the purpose of radiation dose calculations has experienced an explosion in activity in the past two decades. Such an exciting advancement is due to the feasibility of creating three-dimensional geometric details of the human anatomy from tomographic imaging and of performing Monte Carlo radiation transport simulations on increasingly fast and cheap personal computers. The advent of a new type of high-performance computing hardware in recent years-graphics processing units-has made it feasible to carry out time-consuming Monte Carlo calculations at near real-time speeds. This paper introduces the history of three generations of computational human phantoms (the stylized medical internal radiation dosimetry-type phantoms, the voxelized tomographic phantoms, and the boundary representation deformable phantoms) and new development of the graphics processing unit-based Monte Carlo radiation dose calculations. Examples are given for research projects performed by my students in applying computational phantoms and a new Monte Carlo code, ARCHER, to problems in radiation protection, imaging, and radiotherapy. Finally, the paper discusses challenges and future opportunities for research.",Advancing Safety: Role of Equipment Design and Configuration Change in Pediatric Fluoroscopy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30585973,Health physics,2018 12 26,"Diagnostic x-ray exams irradiate the patient to produce an x-ray pattern in space, which is captured and processed into a visible image, followed by clinical interpretation. Diagnostic-quality images at a well-managed radiation dose are required. Improvements to image receptors and image processing algorithms have resulted in improved images at reduced dose levels. However, careful management of x-ray production via design or configuration changes of the imaging device also affect patient dose. This initial dose management step is the focus of this discussion. Imaging equipment vendors, in general, have produced quality images of adults at reasonably managed patient doses. This achievement required teamwork between leading adult hospital staff members and representatives of the imaging equipment vendor within the adult hospital. Most manufacturers have had less opportunity to develop similar optimized configurations for pediatric imaging, the imaging of patients ranging from 2-200 kg between 0-21 y of age. Challenges: The wider dynamic range of patient thicknesses in the pediatric size range compared to the adult range of only 45-140 kg challenges automatic control features. In recent years reduction of patient dose as opposed to proper management has been stressed. The principal objectives of end users and vendors, respectively, are patient care and the bottom line. This too often hampers (if not prevents) a productive working relationship between the vendor and the end user. Too many end users rely too heavily on their equipment vendor to solve imaging/dose concerns. The vendors have an important role to play in this challenge but should not be the sole solution. Qualified medical physicists need an understanding of the design of the imaging device, an understanding that many vendors do not support out of proprietary concerns. The performance of the equipment should be judged based on data acquired with better tools. Solutions: Multiple equipment configurations are needed-each designed to excel at a reduced size of patients. Dose reductions that significantly impact image quality must be rejected. Radiologists and their qualified medical physicists should develop target patient doses (size based) for their unique imaging equipment and preferred level of quantum mottle. Once target doses are established as a function of patient size, vendor application specialists and design engineers should leverage the equipment's strengths and weaknesses to best achieve desired results. The qualified medical physicist should function as an interpreter between the end user and the vendor's design engineers. Are the radiologists' and technologists' expectations of the vendor reasonable and vice versa? While better tools are being developed, vendors may hesitate to make them available or charge excessive dollars for these new features to further slow their adoption. Conclusion: The challenges and solutions require the radiologist, technologist, qualified medical physicist, and vendor representatives to work as a team to manage patient dose and maintain image quality. The installed imaging device will be only as successful as the working relationship between the parties. These challenges and conflicts must continually be overcome to provide the best patient care.",Medical Physics 3.0: Ensuring Quality and Safety in Medical Imaging.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30585972,Health physics,2018 12 26,"Medical imaging often involves radiation and thus radiation protection. Radiation protection in medicine is only one component of the broader calling of health care professionals: fostering human health. As such, radiation risk needs to be put into the context of the larger mandate of improved outcomes in health care. Medical physicists, according to the new vision of Medical Physics 3.0, make a significant contribution to this mandate as they engage proactively and meaningfully in patient care. Facing the new realities of value-based, personalized, and evidence-based practice, Medical Physics 3.0 is an initiative to make physics inform every patient's care by fostering new skills and expanding horizons for the medical physics profession. It provides a framework by which medical physicists can maintain and improve their integral roles in, and contributions to, health care, its innovation, and its precision. One way that Medical Physics 3.0 will manifest itself in medical imaging practice is by engaging physicists to ensure the precise and optimized use of radiation. Optimization takes place through knowing the defining attributes of the technology in use, the specifics of the patient's situation, and the goals of the imaging and/or intervention. The safety as well as the quality of the procedure is ascertained quantitatively and optimized prospectively, ensuring a proper balance between quality and safety to offer maximum potential benefit to the patient. The results of procedures across the health care operation are then retrospectively analyzed to ensure that each procedure has, in actuality, delivered the targeted quality and safety objectives. Characterizing quality and safety in quantitative terms, objectively optimizing them in the practice of personalized care, and analyzing the results from clinical operations all require the unique combination of precision and innovation that physicists bring to the development and practice of medicine.",Recent Epidemiologic Studies and the Linear No-Threshold Model For Radiation Protection-Considerations Regarding NCRP Commentary 27.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30585971,Health physics,2018 12 26,"National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements Commentary 27 examines recent epidemiologic data primarily from low-dose or low dose-rate studies of low linear-energy-transfer radiation and cancer to assess whether they support the linear no-threshold model as used in radiation protection. The commentary provides a critical review of low-dose or low dose-rate studies, most published within the last 10 y, that are applicable to current occupational, environmental, and medical radiation exposures. The strengths and weaknesses of the epidemiologic methods, dosimetry assessments, and statistical modeling of 29 epidemiologic studies of total solid cancer, leukemia, breast cancer, and thyroid cancer, as well as heritable effects and a few nonmalignant conditions, were evaluated. An appraisal of the degree to which the low-dose or low dose-rate studies supported a linear no-threshold model for radiation protection or on the contrary, demonstrated sufficient evidence that the linear no-threshold model is inappropriate for the purposes of radiation protection was also included. The review found that many, though not all, studies of solid cancer supported the continued use of the linear no-threshold model in radiation protection. Evaluations of the principal studies of leukemia and low-dose or low dose-rate radiation exposure also lent support for the linear no-threshold model as used in protection. Ischemic heart disease, a major type of cardiovascular disease, was examined briefly, but the results of recent studies were considered too weak or inconsistent to allow firm conclusions regarding support of the linear no-threshold model. It is acknowledged that the possible risks from very low doses of low linear-energy-transfer radiation are small and uncertain and that it may never be possible to prove or disprove the validity of the linear no-threshold assumption by epidemiologic means. Nonetheless, the preponderance of recent epidemiologic data on solid cancer is supportive of the continued use of the linear no-threshold model for the purposes of radiation protection. This conclusion is in accord with judgments by other national and international scientific committees, based on somewhat older data. Currently, no alternative dose-response relationship appears more pragmatic or prudent for radiation protection purposes than the linear no-threshold model.",The 42nd Lauriston S. Taylor Lecture: Radiation Dosimetry Research for Medicine and Protection-A European Journey.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30585970,Health physics,2018 12 26,"The assessment of doses related to exposures to ionizing radiation is an essential part of all applications of ionizing radiation including radiation medicine, radiation protection, radiation biology, radiation epidemiology, and also industrial uses of radiation. Absorbed dose is generally considered to be the fundamental quantity of radiation dosimetry. It is a metrologically sound quantity for which even primary standards exist for some materials, and it is used routinely in practice. However, there is no unique correlation between absorbed dose and the radiation-induced biological effect considered. There are also different objectives of radiation dosimetry for different applications. In radiation protection, quantities are required to set meaningful exposure limits and to implement the principle of optimization. In radiation therapy, the dependence of clinical outcomes on temporal aspects of the irradiations must be accounted for. In radiation diagnostics, quantities are needed to enable and monitor optimization of radiation dose and image quality. In radiation protection and in therapy with high linear-energy-transfer radiations, appropriate methods and parameters are needed to account for differences in radiation quality. These limitations of the quantity absorbed dose have led to the use of a multiplicity of dose quantities and dose modification factors. Radiation dosimetry continues, therefore, to be a field of active research regarding fundamental and conceptual aspects, taking account of advances in technologies, of novel methods in radiation therapy and diagnostics, and of progress in computational dosimetry. Dosimetry of high-energy radiations such as cosmic radiation encountered at flight altitudes and during space missions as well as at high-energy accelerators has become an important issue. In Europe, collaboration and coordination of radiation research in general, and dosimetry research in particular, are playing an important role. Dedicated research programs of the European Commission have been and still are very valuable and include collaborations with institutes in Eastern Europe and non-European countries. Several current and recent research topics in radiation dosimetry are addressed based on research carried out within European research programs, at European research centers including the European Organization for Nuclear Research (known as CERN), in European particle therapy projects, and at national metrological institutes. One focus is the quantification of radiation quality in radiation protection and in high linear-energy-transfer radiation therapy with emphasis on measurements with low-pressure proportional counters. Another focus is dosimetry of high-energy radiations with respect to measurements of cosmic radiation and at CERN's high-energy accelerators.",Patient Perspectives on Dialogue and Shared Decision Making.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30585966,Health physics,2018 12 26,"The fear of radiation on the part of patients and/or clinical staff can hamper adequate shared medical decision making. Typically, one-sided medical radiation risk communication methods with limited effectiveness are employed, such as paternalistic, risk numerology, and quality ""assurance"" approaches. More study is needed to determine patient preferences and potential fears associated with medical imaging radiation, and the results can provide insights for such discussions. Worry about the potential risks associated with medical imaging radiation has been shown to be substantial in the US population. The level of concern differs by sex, race/ethnicity, education, nationality, and overall health, suggesting that more care and individualized communication and discussion methods need to be employed by clinical staff. The opportunities for improved dialogue with patients (and parents of patients) and the public in general are plentiful.","Communicating Radiation Risk: The Power of Planned, Persuasive Messaging.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30585965,Health physics,2019 02 06,"Every day, health physicists and physicians are expected to communicate effectively with concerned people, but rarely (if ever) are they given training on how to effectively communicate.

Protecting members of the public from radiation emanating from brachytherapy sources implanted in a patient was an issue several decades ago, but with modern brachytherapy, the problem has mostly disappeared. The most frequent treatments are either low-dose-rate permanent implants for prostate cancer, or high-dose-rate procedures for gynecological, breast, or skin cancers. Almost all current permanent implants use low-energy photon sources that are shielded by the patient. Similarly, some temporary implants, such as eye plaques that also use low-energy photon sources, incorporate a metallic shield into the applicator. All high-dose-rate brachytherapy takes place in a treatment vault, in a manner similar to external-beam radiotherapy, thus eliminating exposure to members of the public, in the absence of some terrible error or mistake. Modern brachytherapy techniques either eliminate or greatly reduce radiation exposures to the brachytherapy staff also. As noted above, high-dose-rate treatments take place in a heavily shielded vault, and staff remain outside the vault when the source is out of its shielded housing. For low-energy permanent implants, facilities often order the sources loaded into the implant needles by the vendor, reducing the time the procedure staff is exposed to the source. Often, the loaded needles can be shielded while awaiting implantation. Alternatively, individual sources may be placed using a special applicator that shields the staff. Radiation protection of the patient in many respects differs little from how it was decades ago except for greatly increased precision. Assaying the strength of a source of any kind is still essential. As important as verifying the source strength is ensuring that the source will be in the correct location for the desired time. Imaging serves as the main mechanism to guide the implantation and verify source or applicator position. Modern imaging has unveiled anatomy exquisitely and often permits definition of target disease and neighboring normal structures sufficiently to allow very conformal dose distributions. Despite these great advances and capabilities, errors and mistakes (together called failures) still occur. Failures in health care overall are the third leading cause of death in the United States. Most treatment failures result not from equipment problems but from procedures gone wrong. Attention to comprehensive commissioning of both equipment and procedures and risk-based development of quality management procedures helps protect the patient. Patient safety organizations, established by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, work with client facilities to help identify weaknesses in both treatment procedures and quality management and to develop improvements to enhance protection.",Radiation Oncology-External-Beam Radiation Therapy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30585962,Health physics,2018 12 26,"The application of structural shielding design techniques and goals as outlined in the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements Report 151, Structural Shielding Design and Evaluation for Megavoltage X- and Gamma-Ray Radiotherapy Facilities (2005), continues to be the basis for treatment vault design in 2018 with some updated information. Treatment techniques have changed significantly with the dominant usage of intensity-modulated radiation therapy techniques today based on concurrent imaging. Some of the developments in linear accelerator technology over the past 15 y include flattening filter-free modes, which enable higher instantaneous dose rates; three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy resulting in potentially higher workloads since healthy tissue is spared; improved intensity-modulated radiation therapy treatment delivery systems with lower monitor units per centigray delivered than traditional step and shoot intensity-modulated radiation therapy; stereotactic body radiation therapy with higher treatment fractions and increased workloads; and increased use of stereotactic radiosurgery with conventional linear accelerators as well as robotic arm-mounted linear accelerators with higher treatment fractions. These new treatment units also incorporate multiple-energy x-ray beams (2 to 5 MV typical), which require a significant change in the specification of a workload to be used in each vault. As the equipment in radiation oncology departments has evolved to state-of-the-art modalities, the requirements for adequate radiation shielding for these modalities has become more rigorous. Architectural designs no longer depend on standard maze design rectangular rooms. Innovative layouts and utilization of multiple layers of shielding materials allow much greater flexibility in room designs. Maze-less rooms with direct-shielded doors are part of these challenging designs and are very common today. Use of multiple-density concrete blocks allows quicker construction of vaults and requires less space for the equivalent shielding provided. Combinations of high-density or normal-density concrete, steel, and lead are used in designs to make optimum use of available space and cost. Additional shielding needed at the edges of these single- or bi-parting sliding doors as well as baffle designs for heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems and communication cable penetrations require detailed calculations. Examples of these designs will be given in this presentation. Consideration of the radiation levels around the planned vault must also include adjacent multistory buildings."

Although no definitive cure exists, lowering of the intraocular pressure decreases the rate of progression in the majority of patients with glaucoma. Antiglaucomatous treatment modalities consist predominantly of chronic use of eye drops. It has become increasingly evident that long-term exposure to eye drops has a significant impact on the ocular surface, and thereby on patient compliance and quality of life. Maintenance of the ocular surface is highly dependent on a stable tear film. Conjunctival goblet cells (GCs) of the ocular surface play an important role in providing the innermost mucin layer of the tear film and are essential for maintaining the ocular surface homeostasis. Recent studies have reported severe side effects of antiglaucomatous drops on GCs. In particular, a preservative containing antiglaucomatous drops have been shown to affect the viability and functions of the GCs. Furthermore, GC density has been suggested as a potential predictor of surgical outcome after filtration surgery. The present review provides an overview of the current literature on the impact of antiglaucomatous eye drops on GCs as well as the impact on the ocular surface. Moreover, the existing evidence of a possible association between GC density and glaucoma filtration surgery outcome is summarized. We conclude that prostaglandin analogs spare the conjunctival GCs more compared with other antiglaucomatous drops and that GCs may be a good predictor of surgical outcome after filtration surgery. Overall, given the multiple functions of GCs in the ocular surface homeostasis, dedicated strategies should be adopted to preserve this cell population during the course of glaucoma.",Comparison of Fellow Eyes of Acute Primary Angle Closure and Phacomorphic Angle Closure.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30585936,Journal of glaucoma,2019 02 28,To compare anterior segment parameters in fellow eyes of acute primary angle closure (APAC) and fellow eyes of phacomorphic angle closure (AC) and to identify parameters that could be used to differentiate fellow eyes of the 2 entities.

On-demand replacement therapy is the main therapeutic choice in patients with congenital FVII deficiency. Inhibitor formation against exogenous FVII is very rare and can cause challenges in the management of the disorder. The present study was conducted to assess the prevalence of FVII inhibitor in 50 patients with congenital FVII deficiency under on-demand or prophylaxis treatment by recombinant activated FVII. All patients with confirmed congenital FVII deficiency were assessed for inhibitor development in regular intervals. Inhibitor titer was determined by a modified Nijmegen-Bethesda assay. The study results were analyzed by SPSS software. Among all cases, two patients (4%) developed an FVII inhibitor. Case 1 was a 14-year-old boy with severe FVII deficiency (FVII activity <1%) with regular prophylaxis. The patient was a high-responder with high-titer FVII inhibitor (170 Bethesda Unit). This patient, who had a history of intracranial hemorrhage, had undergone brain surgery three times. The second patient was a 70-years old man with on-demand therapy that also developed a high-titer inhibitor (10 Bethesda Unit). This patient had experienced easy bruising and endured a few surgeries for his brain tumor and, finally, succumbed to the disease. Although the inhibitor formation is a rare phenomenon, it may result in a significant challenge to manage the affected patients.",What concentration of tranexamic acid is needed to inhibit fibrinolysis? A systematic review of pharmacodynamics studies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30585835,Blood coagulation & fibrinolysis : an international journal in haemostasis and thrombosis,2019 04 08,": Intravenous tranexamic acid (TXA) reduces death because of bleeding in patients with trauma and postpartum haemorrhage. However, in some settings intravenous injection is not feasible. To find different routes of administration, we first need to determine the minimal concentration of TXA in the blood that is required to inhibit fibrinolysis.We conducted a systematic review of in-vitro and in-vivo pharmacodynamics studies. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, OviSP, and ISI Web of Science from database inception to November 2017 for all in-vitro (including simulated clotting models) or in-vivo studies reporting the relationship between the TXA concentration in blood or plasma and any reliable measure of fibrinolysis.We found 21 studies of which 20 were in vitro and one was in vivo. Most in-vitro studies stimulated fibrinolysis with tissue plasminogen activator and measured fibrinolysis using viscoelastic, optical density, or immunological assays. TXA concentrations between 10 and 15 mg/l resulted in substantial inhibition of fibrinolysis, although concentrations between 5 and 10 mg/l were partly inhibitory.TXA concentrations of 10-15 mg/l may be suitable targets for pharmacokinetic studies, although TXA concentrations above 5 mg/l may also be effective.","What Does the Word ""Treatable"" Mean?

Although the acoustic environment is known to shape the structure and sensitivity of auditory systems, there is no information on the natural soundscape of this species. Moreover, zebrafish are typically reared in large-scale housing systems (HS), although their acoustic properties and potential effects on hearing remain unknown. We characterized the soundscape of both zebrafish natural habitats and laboratory captive conditions, and discussed possible impact on auditory sensitivity. Sound recordings were conducted in five distinct zebrafish habitats (Southwest India), from quieter stagnant environments with diverse biological/abiotic sounds to louder watercourses characterized by current and moving substrate sounds. Sound pressure level (SPL) varied between 98 and 126 dB re 1 μPa. Sound spectra presented most energy below 3000 Hz and quieter noise windows were found in the noisiest habitats matching the species best hearing range. Contrastingly, recordings from three zebrafish HS revealed higher SPL (122-143 dB) and most energy below 1000 Hz with more spectral peaks, which might cause significant auditory masking. This study establishes an important ground for future research on the adaptation of zebrafish auditory system to the natural soundscapes, and highlights the importance of controlling noise conditions in captivity.",Fluorescently Labeled TracrRNA Improves Work Flow and Facilitates Successful Genome Editing in Zebrafish.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30585775,Zebrafish,2019 04 15,"Gene editing using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) is widely used throughout the zebrafish community for the generation of knockouts and knockins. One of the bottlenecks that exists during the process is the laborious screening of injected embryos for F0 founder fish or CRISPants, weeks after the injection date. In this study we show that the use of fluorescently tagged tracrRNA and sorting for fluorescent embryos as early as the 512-cell stage using stereomicroscope significantly improve yield of fish with successfully CRISPR/Cas9-edited genomes. This is a cost-effective strategy that significantly improves workflow and efficacy in genome editing in particular for less experienced researchers.",Differential Expression Levels of Inflammatory Chemokines and TLRs in Patients Suffering from Mild and Severe Japanese Encephalitis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30585774,Viral immunology,2019 05 20,"Japanese encephalitis (JE) is a vector-borne viral disease with clinical manifestations ranging from asymptomatic to severe neurological symptoms and even leading to death. The exact pathophysiology for diverse clinical spectrum of the disease is complex and has not yet been defined. Studies have postulated that during JE infection, inflammatory cytokines and chemokines are produced after the initial recognition of viral antigens through the engagement of toll-like receptors (TLR) pathways. However, there is paucity of knowledge on the expression levels of chemokines and TLRs among mild and severely affected JE patients. Hence, to better understand disease pathogenesis, we examined the mRNA expression of chemokines, CCL2 and CCL5, and their respective receptors CCR2 and CCR5 along with TLRs viz. TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9 in context of mild and severely Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV)-infected (n = 19) and healthy (n = 19) individuals. Our study showed significant downregulation of CCL2, CCL5, CCR2, CCR5, and TLR3 by log 0.87, 1.02, 0.82, 0.68, and 0.37-fold respectively, among mild cases compared with controls. Significant difference of gene expression among mild and severe JE cases for CCL2 (p < 0.001), CCL5 (p < 0.01), and TLR7 (p < 0.05) was observed. In conclusion, our results proposes that chemokines viz. CCL2 and CCL5 along with TLR7 may be associated with degree of pathogenesis of JE and could be putative therapeutic targets for preventing severe inflammation during viral encephalitis.",Role of Receptors for Advanced Glycation End Products and High-Mobility Group Box 1 in the Outcome of Human T Cell Lymphotropic Type 1 Infection.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30585773,Viral immunology,2019 06 07,"Human T cell lymphotropic type 1 (HTLV-1)-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) is a chronic viral neuroinflammatory disease, which leads to damage of the central nervous system. Inflammatory responses and mediators are both involved in the pathogenesis of the disease and in determining its outcome. High-Mobility Group Box 1 (HMGB1) is a chromatin-associated nuclear protein acting as a signaling molecule in cells after binding to its receptors. Receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) is a transmembrane multiligand receptor that binds to HMGB1. HMGB1-RAGE signaling has an important role in inflammatory and infectious diseases. Inhibition of HMGB1 activity reduces the inflammation in immune-associated diseases. In the present study, we examined the gene expressions and plasma levels of HMGB1 and its receptor RAGE in HAM/TSP patients, HTLV-1-infected asymptomatic carriers (ACs), and healthy controls. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were collected from all the groups and complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized. HMGB-1 messenger RNA (mRNA) expression was quantified by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) TaqMan method, and plasma levels of HMGB1 and soluble RAGE (sRAGE) were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The mRNA expression of HMGB1 was the same among the groups (p > 0.05). No significant difference in the plasma levels of HMGB1 was observed between the groups (p > 0.05). The plasma levels of sRAGE were higher in ACs than HAM/TSP patients, and a significant difference was observed between the two groups (p < 0.001). Our results showed that sRAGE could play a potential role in the control of inflammatory response in HTLV-1 carriers through the inhibition of HMGB1 signaling and potentially could be used as an indicator for evaluation of HAM/TSP developing in HTLV-1-infected individuals.",Factors Associated with the Transfer Decision in Resuscitated Patients with Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest Presenting to a Hospital with Limited Targeted Temperature Management Capability in Korea.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30585772,Therapeutic hypothermia and temperature management,2018 12 26,"This study aimed to identify factors associated with the decision to transfer resuscitated patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) who were initially examined at hospitals with limited targeted temperature management capability (HLTC) in Korea. We included adult patients with OHCA who were initially transported to HLTC from 2012 to 2015. We limited the study population with OHCA who were admitted or transferred. Potential factors associated with the transfer decision were categorized as patient- or hospital-level characteristics. The primary outcome was emergency department disposition: transfer out versus admission to HLTC. A stepwise multivariable logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify factors associated with the outcome. Of the 64,696 patients with OHCA, 37,705 (58.3%) were initially transported to HLTC. Approximately 44.7% of patients were transferred out. In terms of patient-level factors, age, socioeconomic status, and initial electrocardiogram rhythm were associated with the transfer decision. Hospital factors, such as percutaneous coronary intervention capability of HLTC (adjusted odds ratio = 0.16; 95% confidence interval = 0.14-0.19) and location of the metropolitan or urban hospital, were negatively associated with the transfer decision.

Electrolyte disorders may develop at any stage of the cooling process. Such deregulation can place patients at an increased risk for arrhythmias and worsened neurologic outcomes. The impact of TH on serum electrolyte concentration has been described, but electrolyte changes and repletions are yet to be quantified. The primary objective of this study was to quantify the trends in serum potassium and magnesium concentrations during TH and determine the median amount of electrolyte repletions administered. This study was a single-center retrospective cohort conducted at Virginia Commonwealth University Health. Data were collected from neurosurgical patients with intracranial hypertension who underwent TH (<36°C) for ≥48 hours. Patients with a primary neurological insult cooled with the Arctic Sun® 5000 Temperature Management System, who were ≥13 years of age at the time of therapy with a core body temperature of ≥36°C before therapeutic hypothermia, were eligible for inclusion. Forty-three patients meeting the inclusion criteria were analyzed. A total of 42 patients (98%) experienced hypokalemia (<3.5 mEq/L) during TH. A median of 45 mEq per day of potassium repletion was administered during the maintenance phase of cooling. Despite those repletions, patients remained hypokalemic 30% of the time. Median serum magnesium concentrations during the maintenance phase of TH remained consistently within goal range of 1.8-2.5 mg/dL. Five patients (12%) experienced at least one episode of cardiac dysrhythmia during the cooling period. Standard potassium electrolyte repletion protocols did not adequately maintain serum potassium concentrations above our target of 3.5 mEq/L in neurosurgical patients undergoing TH.

Purpose:
 To evaluate awareness of female cancer patients about fertility impairment following cancer treatment. 
Patients and Methods:
 This cross-sectional study was conducted in Imam Hossein Hospital between March 2014 and July 2015. Women of childbearing age with cancer who were treated in an oncology clinic and referred for follow-up were asked to fill out the questionnaire designed for this purpose. The process of filling out the questionnaire was managed by a resident of clinical oncology during patient interviews. 
Results:
 Two hundred forty-seven patients with mean age of 35.5 years were included. The most common cancers were breast cancer (61.9%) and gynecologic cancer (10.9%). Among all patients, 22.7% had received information about infertility risk. The likelihood that women would have received information about fertility varied by cancer type. Among women with gynecologic cancers, only 59.3% had received information about the effects of treatment on fertility despite having cancers of the reproductive system. Moreover, 19.6% of women with breast cancer and 18.5% of those with other cancers had received fertility information (p < 0.001). 
Significance of Results:
 Knowledge and awareness of female cancer patients of childbearing age about the impact of cancer treatment on fertility and fertility preservation are limited. A structured program is required to provide complete information regarding the risk of fertility impairment following cancer treatment and increase the knowledge of these patients to enable them to make a proper decision about fertility preservation.",One-stage posterior approach for treating multilevel noncontiguous thoracic and lumbar spinal tuberculosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30585750,Postgraduate medicine,2019 01 31,"Multilevel noncontiguous thoracic and lumbar spinal tuberculosis (MNST) is a relatively rare entity.

Tumor dissemination affecting ∼20% of EC patients is characterized at the primary carcinoma by epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) associated with myometrial infiltration. At distant sites, the interaction of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) with the microenvironment is crucial for metastatic colonization, with a participation of the extracellular vesicles (EVs). We comprehensively approached these primary and secondary sites to study the impact of tumor EVs on the metastatic efficiency of CTCs in EC. Tumor EVs in circulation reproduce the epithelial phenotype predominant in the primary carcinoma, whereas CTCs are characterized by an EMT phenotype. We modeled this EMT-related clinical scenario in the Hec1A endometrial cell line and characterized the epithelial-like EVs in circulation by SILAC proteome analysis. The identification of proteins involved in cell-cell and cell-matrix interaction and binding, together with in vitro evidence of an improved adhesion of CTC to a functionalized endothelium, suggests a contribution of the epithelial-like EVs in the homing of CTCs at metastatic sites. Accordingly, adhesion protein LGALS3BP was found to be significantly enriched in circulating EVs from a cohort of EC patients with a high risk of recurrence by targeted proteomics (multiple reaction monitoring), highlighting its potential in liquid biopsy in EC.",Mapping the Ku Interactome Using Proximity-Dependent Biotin Identification in Human Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30585729,Journal of proteome research,2019 03 01,"The Ku heterodimer, composed of Ku70 and Ku80, is best characterized for its role in repairing double-stranded DNA breaks but is also known to participate in other regulatory processes. Despite our understanding of Ku protein interplay during DNA repair, the extent of Ku's protein interactions in other processes has never been fully determined. Using proximity-dependent biotin identification (BioID) and affinity purification coupled to mass spectrometry (AP-MS) with wild-type Ku70, we identified candidate proteins that interact with the Ku heterodimer in HEK293 cells, in the absence of exogenously induced DNA damage. BioID analysis identified approximately 250 nuclear proteins, appearing in at least two replicates, including known Ku-interacting factors such as MRE11A, WRN, and NCOA6. Meanwhile, AP-MS analysis identified approximately 50 candidate proteins. Of the novel protein interactors identified, many were involved in functions already suspected to involve Ku such as transcriptional regulation, DNA replication, and DNA repair, while several others suggest that Ku may be involved in additional functions such as RNA metabolism, chromatin-remodeling, and microtubule dynamics. Using a combination of BioID and AP-MS, this is the first report that comprehensively characterizes the Ku protein interaction landscape, revealing new cellular processes and protein complexes involving the Ku complex.",Self-assembly of Janus Dumbbell Nanocrystals and Their Enhanced Surface Plasmon Resonance.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30585728,Nano letters,2019 03 20,"Self-assembly is a critical process that can greatly expand the existing structures and lead to new functionality of nanoparticle systems. Multicomponent superstructures self-assembled from nanocrystals have shown promise as multifunctional materials for various applications. Despite recent progress in assembly of homogeneous nanocrystals, synthesis and self-assembly of Janus nanocrystals with contrasting surface chemistry remains a significant challenge. Herein, we designed a novel Janus nanocrystal platform to control the self-assembly of nanoparticles in aqueous solutions by balancing the hydrophobic and hydrophilic moieties. A series of superstructures have been assembled by systematically varying the Janus balance and assembly conditions. Janus Au-Fe3O4 dumbbell nanocrystals (<20 nm) were synthesized with the hydrophobic ligands coated on the Au lobe and negatively charged hydrophilic ligands coated on the Fe3O4 lobe. We systematically fine-tune the lobe size ratio, surface coating, external conditions, and even additional growth of Au nanocrystal domains on the Au lobe of dumbbell nanoparticles (Au-Au-Fe3O4) to harvest self-assembly structures including clusters, chains, vesicles, and capsules. It was discovered that in all these assemblies the hydrophobic Au lobes preferred to stay together. In addition, these superstructures clearly demonstrated different levels of enhanced surface plasmon resonance that is directly correlated with the Au coupling in the assembly structure. The strong interparticle plasmonic coupling displayed a red-shift in surface plasmon resonance, with larger structures formed by Au-Au-Fe3O4 assembly extending into the near-infrared region. Self-assembly of Janus dumbbell nanocrystals can also be reversible under different pH values. The biphasic Janus dumbbell nanocrystals offer a platform for studying the novel interparticle coupling and open up opportunities in applications including sensing, disease diagnoses, and therapy.",Giant Defect-Induced Effects on Nanoscale Charge Separation in Semiconductor Photocatalysts.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30585727,Nano letters,2019 05 29,"Defects can markedly impact the performance of semiconductor-based photocatalysts, where the spatial separation of photogenerated charges is required for converting solar energy into fuels. However, understanding exactly how defects affect photogenerated charge separation at nanometer scale remains quite challenging. Here, using time- and space-resolved surface photovoltage approaches, we demonstrate that the distribution of surface photogenerated charges and the direction of photogenerated charge separation are determined by the defects distributed within a 100 nm surface region of a photocatalytic Cu2O particle. This is enabled by the defect-induced charge separation process, arising from the trapping of electrons at the near-surface defect states and the accumulation of holes at the surface states. More importantly, the driving force for defect-induced charge separation is greater than 4.2 kV/cm and can be used to drive photocatalytic reactions. These findings highlight the importance of near-surface defect engineering in promoting photogenerated charge separation and manipulating surface photogenerated charges; further, they open up a powerful avenue for improving photocatalytic charge separation and solar energy conversion efficiency.",Selective Metal-Assisted Assembly of Mesocates or Helicates with Tristhiosemicarbazone Ligands.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30585726,Inorganic chemistry,2019 04 24,The effect of the ligand and/or metal-related factors on the formation of tristhiosemicarbazone metallosupramolecular complexes has been studied in this work.

Generally, miRNAs undergo synergistic adjustments in tumor cells. Herein, a mass-spectrometric method based on a duplex-specific-nuclease (DSN)-enzyme-assisted signal-amplification technique was proposed for label-free and multiplexed detection of multiple miRNAs, and applied to the quantification of three miRNAs (i.e., miRNA-141, miRNA-21, and let-7a) in samples of HeLa and MDA-MB231 cell extracts. Experimental results showed that the digestion modes of DSN against three different DNAs complementary to miRNA-141, miRNA-21, and let-7a in their DNA-miRNA heteroduplexes were quite different, verifying the multiplexed-detection capability of the proposed method. Moreover, an advanced calibration model was derived for the quantitative analysis of the complex mass-spectral data measured during the label-free and multiplexed detection of miRNA-141, miRNA-21, and let-7a by the proposed mass-spectrometric method. With the aid of the advanced calibration model, the proposed mass-spectrometric method achieved quite reliable quantitative results for miRNA-141, miRNA-21, and let-7a in samples of HeLa and MDA-MB231 cell extracts, with recovery rates within the range of 89.2 to 111.6%. The limits of detection (LODs) of the proposed mass-spectrometric method for miRNA-141, miRNA-21, and let-7a in standard samples were estimated to be 42, 41, and 95 pM, respectively. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that the proposed mass-spectrometric method can be a competitive alternative for the label-free and multiplexed detection of multiple miRNAs in clinical diagnosis.",Restoration of miRNA-149 Expression by TmPyP4 Induced Unfolding of Quadruplex within Its Precursor.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30585723,Biochemistry,2019 02 12,"Noncoding RNAs are functional RNA molecules that get transcribed from DNA but are not translated into proteins; yet, they can regulate gene expression at transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. Secondary structures present within these RNAs play a major role in determining their nature of function. In the case of miRNAs, the precursor miRNA have a hairpin stem loop structure which is required for Dicer recognition and further maturation. Alternately, it might assume a G-quadruplex structure. The transition from hairpin to G-quadruplex depends upon the nucleotide sequence as well as the cellular microenvironment, and this might affect the miRNA maturation and other downstream activity. Formation of the G-quadruplex within precursor miRNA-149 has been shown to inhibit Dicer processing activity followed by suppression of miRNA-149 maturation in cancer cells. In this report, we show that suppression of cell proliferation by the upregulated miRNA-149 could be rescued by unfolding the G-quadruplex present in pre-miRNA-149 by TmPyP4 (Porphyrin) treatment. Using UV-visible spectroscopy, circular dichroism, and isothermal titration calorimetry, we observed that TmPyP4 binds strongly to G-quadruplex and unfolds it, which was further verified by NMR spectroscopy. In cellulo, qRT-PCR measurements of miRNA-149 in MCF-7 breast cancer cells showed concentration dependent enhancement of mature miRNA-149 upon treatment of TmPyP4. As a consequence of enhanced miRNA-149 activity, we also observe the reduction in miRNA-149 target protein ZBTB2 that eventually leads to reduced cell proliferation.",Environmental Drivers of Rare Earth Element Bioaccumulation in Freshwater Zooplankton.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30585722,Environmental science & technology,2019 02 05,"Human activities have resulted in significant release of rare earth elements (REEs) into the environment. However, the pathways of REEs from waters and soils into freshwater food webs remain poorly understood. Recent studies suggest that aquatic invertebrates may be good biomonitors for REEs, yet there is little information on factors that control REE bioaccumulation in these organisms. Our goal was to study the environmental drivers of REE levels in zooplankton, a key component in plankton food webs, across lakes from geographic areas with different bedrock geology. From 2011 to 2014, bulk zooplankton samples were collected for REE analysis from 39 lakes in eastern Canada. We observed a more than 200 fold variation in surface water REE concentrations and a 10-fold variation in sediment REE concentrations. These concentration gradients were associated with a range of more than an order of magnitude in zooplankton REE concentrations (∑REEY 3.2-210 nmol g-1). We found higher REE bioaccumulation in zooplankton from lakes with lower pH and higher REE to dissolved organic carbon ratios. Bioaccumulation was also strongly linked to the free ion concentrations of REEs (REE3+) in surface waters. Our study suggests that zooplankton REE bioaccumulation is an excellent predictor of bioavailable REEs in freshwaters.",Shape-Tuned Junction Resistivity and Self-Damping Dynamics in Intense Pulsed Light Sintering of Silver Nanostructure Films.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30585721,ACS applied materials & interfaces,2019 04 15,"Concurrently reducing processing temperature, electrical resistance, and material cost with scalable fabrication capabilities is critical for conductive elements of flexible and planar electronics. Intense pulsed light sintering (IPL) of mixed dissimilar-shape conductive nanostructures may achieve this goal. However, this potential is hindered by knowledge gaps on how dissimilarity in nanostructure shape affects interparticle neck growth kinetics in general and the self-damping coupling between neck growth and optical absorption in IPL. We study these phenomena for IPL of mixed Ag nanowires (NWs, 40 nm diameter, 100-200 μm length) and nanospheres (NSs, 40 nm diameter), both experimentally and by linking molecular dynamics simulations with optical modeling. An optimal 50:50 mixing ratio lowers resistivity (5.59 μΩ·cm) and peak temperatures (250-150 °C) relative to pure NS films and reduces material costs relative to pure NW films with similar resistivity, in 2.5 s of IPL. The drop in peak temperatures in consecutive optical pulses reduces with greater NW content. Sintering-induced dislocation generation drives higher neck growth at NW-NS and NW-NW interfaces and anisotropic neck growth at NW-NS interfaces. This indicates that when NWs are introduced into NS films, along with lesser number of interfacial contact points, an inherent reduction in sintering-induced junction resistivity plays a major role in reducing film resistivity. The self-damping coupling and optical absorption, which drive temperature evolution in IPL, are tunable by nanostructure shape. The introduction of NWs into a NS ensemble reduces the dependence of optical absorption on neck growth. We discuss how these insights elucidate a set of physical phenomena that can guide the choice of dissimilar shaped nanostructures to concurrently reduce resistivity and temperatures in IPL and other sintering processes.",Development of ALD Coatings for Harsh Environment Applications.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30585719,ACS applied materials & interfaces,2019 03 01,"Atomic layer deposition (ALD) is a well-known technique for the fabrication of ultrathin and highly conformal barrier coatings which have extensively been used for the protection of electronic devices in open atmospheric conditions. Here, we extend the scope for the application of low-temperature-deposited plasma-enhanced ALD barrier coatings for the protection of devices in a variety of chemical environments. The chemical stability tests were conducted in 3.5% NaCl, sea water, HCl (pH 4), and H2SO4 (pH 4) solutions for ALD Al2O3, HfO2, TiO2, and ZrO2, deposited at 100 °C on TiO2-coated Au and ALD ZnO (photoactive)-coated Si substrates. Using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and photoluminescence (PL) study, various aspects of the barrier properties and performance of ALD films in harsh chemical environments were explored. We demonstrate that the combined approach involving EIS and PL provides unique insights into the suitability of ALD films as barriers in harsh environments involving ionic solutions. The observations from EIS and PL tests are supported by the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis of ALD materials. Of the materials tested, ALD TiO2 and ZrO2 were found to be the most stable, chemically, in all four solutions, whereas TiO2 was a better permeation barrier."

Cognitive science,2019 05 17,"Neuroconstructivism can provide Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) with a developmental framework to understand mental disorders. Neuroconstructivism proposes that mental disorders are the outcome of a developmental trajectory. Based on this assumption, symptoms would reveal the system's adaptation to optimize functioning according to the system's experience of the physical and social contexts. RDoC adopts a translational research approach with the aim of detecting, curing, and preventing mental illness. More specifically this involves to: (a) identify early signs of mental disorders, (b) find the optimal patient-treatment fit, and (c) design efficient interventions to prevent the system's eventual pathological functioning. We propose that meeting RDoC's threefold objective necessarily involves predicting the system's developmental trajectory. Such endeavor requires counting with assessment tools that are sensitive to both the process of development and its different contexts; the measures provided by these tools will allow identifying the risk and protective factors that make the system vulnerable to depart from a typical developmental trajectory. Including vectors relative to time and contexts in a relevant part of the matrix will make of RDoC a truly integrative model, which considers the relationships between behavior and neural circuits throughout the developmental pathway.

Gallium-68 DOTATOC confirmed the suspicion of digestive neuroendocrine tumour metastatic to the ovaries and the final diagnosis was made following radical surgery. To the best of our knowledge, the mainly fibrous aspect at imaging, resembling that of the primary tumour, is the first to be described in English literature.

It contains six tandem bromodomains (BDs), which are specialized structures that recognize acetyl-lysine residues. While BD2 has been found to bind acetylated histone H3 lysine 14 (H3K14ac), it is not known whether other BDs collaborate with BD2 to generate strong binding to H3K14ac, and the importance of H3K14ac recognition for the molecular and tumor suppressor function of PBRM1 is also unknown. We discovered that full-length PBRM1, but not its individual BDs, strongly binds H3K14ac. BDs 2, 4, and 5 were found to collaborate to facilitate strong binding to H3K14ac. Quantitative measurement of the interactions between purified BD proteins and H3K14ac or nonacetylated peptides confirmed the tight and specific association of the former. Interestingly, while the structural integrity of BD4 was found to be required for H3K14ac recognition, the conserved acetyl-lysine binding site of BD4 was not. Furthermore, simultaneous point mutations in BDs 2, 4, and 5 prevented recognition of H3K14ac, altered promoter binding and gene expression, and caused PBRM1 to relocalize to the cytoplasm. In contrast, tumor-derived point mutations in BD2 alone lowered PBRM1's affinity to H3K14ac and also disrupted promoter binding and gene expression without altering cellular localization. Finally, overexpression of PBRM1 variants containing point mutations in BDs 2, 4, and 5 or BD2 alone failed to suppress tumor growth in a xenograft model. Taken together, our study demonstrates that BDs 2, 4, and 5 of PBRM1 collaborate to generate high affinity to H3K14ac and tether PBRM1 to chromatin. Mutations in BD2 alone weaken these interactions, and this is sufficient to abolish its molecular and tumor suppressor functions.",Newborns in crisis: An outline of neonatal ethical dilemmas in humanitarian medicine.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30585694,Developing world bioethics,2018 12 26,"Newborn infants are among those most severely affected by humanitarian crises.

In this paper, we first systematically review existing guidelines relating to the treatment and resuscitation of newborns in humanitarian crises, finding little substantive ethical guidance for those providing humanitarian healthcare. We next draw on paradigm cases and published literature to identify and describe some of the major ethical questions common to these settings.

'Microtom' for growth in Bioregenerative Life Support Systems: exploring the effect of high-LET ionising radiation on photosynthesis, leaf structure and fruit traits.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30585676,"Plant biology (Stuttgart, Germany)",2019 06 07,"The realisation of manned space exploration requires the development of Bioregenerative Life Support Systems (BLSS). In such self-sufficient closed habitats, higher plants have a fundamental role in air regeneration, water recovery, food production and waste recycling. In the space environment, ionising radiation represents one of the main constraints to plant growth. In this study, we explore whether low doses of heavy ions, namely Ca 25 Gy, delivered at the seed stage, may induce positive outcomes on growth and functional traits in plants of Solanum lycopersicum L. 'Microtom'. After irradiation of seed, plant growth was monitored during the whole plant life cycle, from germination to fruit ripening. Morphological parameters, photosynthetic efficiency, leaf anatomical functional traits and antioxidant production in leaves and fruits were analysed. Our data demonstrate that irradiation of seeds with 25 Gy Ca ions does not prevent achievement of the seed-to-seed cycle in 'Microtom', and induces a more compact plant size compared to the control. Plants germinated from irradiated seeds show better photochemical efficiency than controls, likely due to the higher amount of D1 protein and photosynthetic pigment content. Leaves of these plants also had smaller cells with a lower number of chloroplasts. The dose of 25 Gy Ca ions is also responsible for positive outcomes in fruits: although developing a lower number of berries, plants germinated from irradiated seeds produce larger berries, richer in carotenoids, ascorbic acid and anthocyanins than controls. These specific traits may be useful for 'Microtom' cultivation in BLSS in space, in so far as the crew members could benefit from fresh food richer in functional compounds that can be directly produced on board.",White matter during concussion recovery: Comparing diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30585674,Human brain mapping,2019 03 12,"Concussion pathophysiology in humans remains incompletely understood. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has identified microstructural abnormalities in otherwise normal appearing brain tissue, using measures of fractional anisotropy (FA), axial diffusivity (AD), and radial diffusivity (RD). The results of prior DTI studies suggest that acute alterations in microstructure persist beyond medical clearance to return to play (RTP), but these measures lack specificity. To better understand the observed effects, this study combined DTI with neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI), which employs a more sophisticated description of water diffusion in the brain. A total of 66 athletes were recruited, including 33 concussed athletes, scanned within 7 days after concussion and at RTP, along with 33 matched controls. Both univariate and multivariate methods identified DTI and NODDI parameters showing effects of concussion on white matter. Spatially extensive decreases in FA and increases in AD and RD were associated with reduced intra-neurite water volume, at both the symptomatic phase of injury and RTP, indicating that effects persist beyond medical clearance. Subsequent analyses also demonstrated that concussed athletes with higher symptom burden and a longer recovery time had greater reductions in FA and increased AD, RD, along with increased neurite dispersion. This study provides the first longitudinal evaluation of concussion from acute injury to RTP using combined DTI and NODDI, significantly enhancing our understanding of the effects of concussion on white matter microstructure.","Adaptive variation, including local adaptation, requires decades to become evident in common gardens.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30585672,Ecological applications : a publication of the Ecological Society of America,2019 03 01,"Population-level adaptation to spatial variation in factors such as climate and soils is critical for climate-vulnerability assessments, restoration seeding, and other ecological applications in species management, and the underlying information is typically based on common-garden studies that are short duration. Here, we show >20 yr were required for adaptive differences to emerge among 13 populations of a widespread shrub (sagebrush, Artemisia tridentata ssp wyomingensis) collected from around the western United States and planted into common gardens. Additionally, >10 yr were required for greater survival of local populations, that is, local adaptation, to become evident. Variation in survival was best explained by the combination of populations' home ecoregion combined with grouping of minimum temperature and aridity. Additional reductions in survival were explained by ungrouped (i.e., continuous) measures of garden-to-population-origin separation in geographic distance (5% decrease in survival per 100 km increase in separation; R2  = 0.22) and especially in minimum temperature in younger plants (-4% per + °C difference, R2  = 0.56 vs. 0.29 in the 14th vs. 27th post-planting years, respectively). Longer-term common garden studies are needed. While we await them, uncertainty in adaptive variation resulting from short-term observations could be quantitatively estimated and reported with seed-transfer guidelines to reduce risks of introducing maladapted provenances in restoration.",Playground equipment-related head injuries requiring hospitalization in children.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30585671,Pediatrics international : official journal of the Japan Pediatric Society,2019 04 12,The aim of this study was to investigate the circumstances of playground equipment-related head injuries in children and consider preventive measures based on the associated characteristics.,Maternal photoperiodic programming enlightens the internal regulation of thyroid-hormone deiodinases in tanycytes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30585670,Journal of neuroendocrinology,2019 01 29,"Seasonal rhythms in physiology are widespread among mammals living in temperate zones. These rhythms rely on the external photoperiodic signal being entrained to the seasons, although they persist under constant conditions, revealing their endogenous origin. Internal long-term timing (circannual cycles) can be revealed in the laboratory as photoperiodic history-dependent responses, comprising the ability to respond differently to similar photoperiodic cues based on prior photoperiodic experience. In juveniles, history-dependence relies on the photoperiod transmitted by the mother to the fetus in utero, a phenomenon known as ""maternal photoperiodic programming"" (MPP). The response to photoperiod in mammals involves the nocturnal pineal hormone melatonin, which regulates a neuroendocrine network including thyrotrophin in the pars tuberalis and deiodinases in tanycytes, resulting in changes in thyroid hormone in the mediobasal hypothalamus. This review addresses MPP and discusses the latest findings on its impact on the thyrotrophin/deiodinase network. Finally, commonalities between MPP and other instances of endogenous seasonal timing are considered, and a unifying scheme is suggested in which timing arises from a long-term communication between the pars tuberalis and the hypothalamus and resultant spontaneous changes in local thyroid hormone status, independently of the pineal melatonin signal.",Convergent synaptic inputs to layer 1 cells of mouse cortex.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30585669,The European journal of neuroscience,2019 01 16,"We used whole cell recordings from slice preparations of mouse cortex to identify various inputs to neurons of layer 1. Two sensory cortical areas were targeted: a primary somatosensory area, namely, the barrel cortex of S1, and a higher order visual area, namely, V2M. Results were similar from both areas. By activating local inputs using photostimulation with caged glutamate, we also identified glutamatergic (and possibly GABAergic) inputs from all lower layers plus GABAergic inputs from nearby layer 1 neurons. However, the patterns of such inputs to layer 1 neurons showed great variation among cells. In separate experiments, we found that electrical stimulation of axons running parallel to the cortical surface in layer 1 also evoked a variety of convergent input types to layer 1 neurons, including glutamatergic ""drivers"" and ""modulators"" plus classic modulatory inputs, including serotonergic, nicotinic, α- and β-adrenergic, from subcortical sites. Given that these layer 1 cells significantly affect the responses of other cortical neurons, especially via affecting the apical dendrites of pyramidal cells so important to cortical functioning, their role in cortical processing is significant. We believe that the data presented here lead to better understanding of the functioning of layer 1 neurons in their role of influencing cortical processing.",What is the added value of digital image analysis of HER2 immunohistochemistry in breast cancer in clinical practice?

The pharmacokinetic profiles of these compounds were compared after oral administration of five kinds of Da Hong Pao tea to rats. Biosamples processed with a mixture of β-glucuronidase and sulfatase were extracted with ethyl acetate-isopropanol. Chromatographic separation was achieved by gradient elution using 10 mm HCOONH4 solution and methanol as the mobile phase. Analytes were detected using negative ion electrospray ionization in multiple reaction monitoring mode. The lower limits of quantification were 1.0, 0.74 and 0.5 ng/mL for theaflavins, two catechins and three catechins, respectively. The validation parameters were well within acceptable limits. The average half-lives (t1/2 ) in blood of the reference solution group was much shorter than those of tea samples.

Tannins are known to prevent or decelerate protein degradation in the rumen and may be able to do so in silages as well. Therefore, the present evaluation aimed to analyse the influence of tannins on silage quality. This was done by integrating from all suitable experiments found in literature on the topic in a meta-analysis approach. A total of 122 datasets originating from 28 experiments obtained from 16 published articles and one own unpublished experiment were included in the database. Tannins in the silages originated either from the plants ensiled or from supplementations of tanniferous plants or tannins extracted from such plants. Tannin concentrations ranged from 0 to 57.8 g/kg dry matter, and the ensiling period varied from 30 to 130 days. The analysis was based on the linear mixed model methodology in which the different studies were considered as random effects and tannin-related properties (either concentration or type of tannins) were treated as fixed effects. Results revealed that greater concentrations of tannins were associated with a decrease of butyrate concentration in the silages (p < 0.05). An increasing tannin concentration was also accompanied with smaller proportions of soluble N, free amino acid N, non-protein nitrogen and NH3 -N in total silage N (p < 0.05). The relationships between hydrolysable and condensed tannins and the decline in butyrate and NH3 -N concentrations in the silages were of different magnitude (p < 0.05). A higher tannin concentration was associated with a decline in in vitro dry matter digestibility. It was concluded that tannins apparently have the ability to limit extensive proteolysis which may occur during ensiling and thus may improve the fermentative quality of silages. A desired side effect seems to be given by the tannins' apparent property to limit the activity of the butyrate-producing microbes.",Generation of genetically engineered non-human primate models of brain function and neurological disorders.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30585654,American journal of primatology,2019 04 16,"Research with non-human primates (NHP) has been essential and effective in increasing our ability to find cures for a large number of diseases that cause human suffering and death. Extending the availability and use of genetic engineering techniques to NHP will allow the creation and study of NHP models of human disease, as well as broaden our understanding of neural circuits in the primate brain. With the recent development of efficient genetic engineering techniques that can be used for NHP, there's increased hope that NHP will significantly accelerate our understanding of the etiology of human neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders. In this article, we review the present state of genetic engineering tools used in NHP, from the early efforts to induce exogeneous gene expression in macaques and marmosets, to the latest results in producing germline transmission of different transgenes and the establishment of knockout lines of specific genes. We conclude with future perspectives on the further development and employment of these tools to generate genetically engineered NHP.",Candida auris otomycosis in Iran and review of recent literature.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30585653,Mycoses,2019 03 04,"Candida auris is a multidrug-resistant yeast emerging in immunocompromised and in otherwise healthy individuals. Due to difficulties in microbiological identification of C. auris because of the lack of available laboratory technology in developing countries, the number of patients affected is most likely underestimated. We report the first case of C. auris otitis which now adds Iran as the fifth country around the Persian Gulf, in addition to Kuwait, Oman, United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia. Candida auris is an unknown pathogen in routine laboratories in Iran because most Candida isolates are probably misdiagnosed. Otomycosis seems to be a different clinical presentation of C. auris mainly involving isolates from the East-Asian clade. We compared the mycological and clinical details of the Iranian patient with other cases of otitis reported since the last review of C. auris otomycosis in 2017.",The metabolome as a biomarker of mortality risk in the common marmoset.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30585652,American journal of primatology,2019 06 10,"Recently, the common marmoset has been proposed as a non-human primate model of aging. Their short lifespan coupled with pathologies that are similar to humans make them an ideal model to understand the genetic, metabolic, and environmental factors that influence aging and longevity. However, many of the underlying physiological changes that occur with age in the marmoset are unknown. Here, we attempt to determine if individual metabolites are predictive of future death and to recapitulate past metabolomic results after a change in environment (move across the country) was imposed on a colony of marmosets. We first determined that low levels of tryptophan metabolism metabolites were associated with risk of death in a 2-year follow-up in the animals, suggesting these metabolites may be used as future biomarkers of mortality. We also discovered that betaine metabolism and methionine metabolism are associated with aging regardless of environment for the animals, or of metabolomic assay technique. These two metabolic pathways are therefore of particular interest to examine as future targets for health and lifespan extending interventions. Many of the pathways associated with age in our first study of marmoset metabolomics were not found to have significant age effects in our second study, suggesting more work is needed to understand the reproducibility of large scale metabolomic studies in mammalian models. Overall, we were able to show that while several metabolomics markers show promise in understanding health and lifespan relationships with aging, it is possible that choice of technique for assay and reproducibility in these types of studies are still issues that need to be examined further.","Calcium activation of cortical neurons by continuous electrical stimulation: Frequency dependence, temporal fidelity, and activation density.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30585651,Journal of neuroscience research,2019 04 19,"Electrical stimulation of the brain has become a mainstay of fundamental neuroscience research and an increasingly prevalent clinical therapy. Despite decades of use in basic neuroscience research and the growing prevalence of neuromodulation therapies, gaps in knowledge regarding activation or inactivation of neural elements over time have limited its ability to adequately interpret evoked downstream responses or fine-tune stimulation parameters to focus on desired responses. In this work, in vivo two-photon microscopy was used to image neuronal calcium activity in layer 2/3 neurons of somatosensory cortex (S1) in male C57BL/6J-Tg(Thy1-GCaMP6s)GP4.3Dkim/J mice during 30 s of continuous electrical stimulation at varying frequencies. We show frequency-dependent differences in spatial and temporal somatic responses during continuous stimulation. Our results elucidate conflicting results from prior studies reporting either dense spherical activation of somas biased toward those near the electrode, or sparse activation of somas at a distance via axons near the electrode. These findings indicate that the neural element specific temporal response local to the stimulating electrode changes as a function of applied charge density and frequency. These temporal responses need to be considered to properly interpret downstream circuit responses or determining mechanisms of action in basic science experiments or clinical therapeutic applications.","Selecting for changes in average ""parity curve"" pattern of litter size in Large White pigs.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30585650,Journal of animal breeding and genetics = Zeitschrift fur Tierzuchtung und Zuchtungsbiologie,2019 03 12,"This study aimed to analyse genetic background of variation in reproductive performance between parities of a sow and to investigate selection strategies to change the ""parity curve"". Total number born (TNB) recorded in Large White sows was provided by Topigs Norsvin. Analysis with basic (BM) and random regression (RRM) models was done in ASReml 4.1. The BM included only a fixed ""parity curve"", while RRM included 3rd order polynomials for additive genetic and permanent sow effects. Parameters from RRM were used in simulations in SelAction 2.1. Based on Akaike information criterion, RRM was a better model for TNB data. Genetic variance and heritability estimates of TNB from BM and RRM were increasing with parity from parity 2. Genetically, parity 1 is the most different from parities 7 to 10, whereas most similar to parities 2 and 3. This indicates presence of genetic variation to change the ""parity curve"". Based on simulations, the selection to increase litter size in parity 1 only increases TNB in all parities, but does not change the observed shape of ""parity curve"", whereas selection for increased TNB in parity 1 and reduced TNB in parity 5 decreases differences between parities, but also reduces overall TNB in all parities. Changing the ""parity curve"" will be difficult as the genetic and phenotypic relationships between the parities are hard to overcome even when selecting for one parity.","Rituximab therapy for refractory autoimmune bullous diseases: A multicenter, open-label, single-arm, phase 1/2 study on 10 Japanese patients.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30585649,The Journal of dermatology,2019 05 28,"This was a multicenter study of rituximab, a chimeric monoclonal immunoglobulin G antibody directed against CD20, for the treatment of refractory autoimmune bullous diseases (pemphigus and pemphigoid). Ten patients (three with pemphigus vulgaris, six with pemphigus foliaceus and one with bullous pemphigoid) were treated with a single cycle of rituximab (four weekly infusions at a dose of 375 mg/m2 of body surface area). The primary end-points were the number of serious adverse events and rate of complete remission at 40 weeks. Five patients (50%) achieved complete remission with minimal therapy (defined as no active lesions with lower doses of systemic corticosteroids compared to that with prednisolone 10 mg/day). Improvements in clinical scores (Pemphigus Disease Area Index) and decreases in autoantibody titers in the sera were observed in the four pemphigus patients who failed to achieve complete remission. This suggests that rituximab was effective in nine of 10 cases. Two serious adverse events (Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia and septic shock due to infectious arthritis) were observed and adequately treated with hospitalization. CD19-positive B lymphocytes in the peripheral blood decreased on day 29 following rituximab treatment, and remained at low levels throughout the observation period (280 days).

There are growing bodies of evidence revealing the antitumor effect of curcumin in different tumors; although the molecular mechanism behind this inhibition in glioblastoma multiform (GBM) still remains unclear. Here we investigated the antitumor activity of nano micelles curcumin compared with erlotinib in U-373 cells in monolayer cell cultures and spheroids models. Furthermore, we characterized affecting cell cycle perturbation, as well as apoptosis induction in GBM cells. The antiproliferative activity of nano micelles curcumin and erlotinib were assessed in monolayer and spheroid models. The influence of the cell cycle and expression levels of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) and Wnt/β-catenin pathway was checked. Nano micelles curcumin suppressed cell growth in U-373 cells via modulation of Wnt and NF-κB pathways. Moreover, cells developed an early G2/M cell cycle arrest followed by sub-G1 apoptosis and apoptotic bodies formation posttreatment with nano micelles curcumin and erlotinib. In the core signaling pathways of GBM, nano micelles curcumin either significantly influences the NF-κB pathway by decreasing p-65 expression or significantly inhibits the Wnt/β-catenin pathway by declining cyclin D1 expression. In conclusion, we have shown that nano micelles curcumin effectively prevent proliferation, and invasion of GBM cells through perturbation of Wnt/β-catenin and NF-κB pathways, suggesting further investigations on the therapeutic application of this novel anticancer drug in in vivo models.",Apelin/APJ system: A potential therapeutic target for endothelial dysfunction-related diseases.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30585633,Journal of cellular physiology,2019 04 23,"APJ is a G protein-coupled receptor and its endogenous ligand is apelin.

In this review, we concentrate on the regulatory mechanism of apelin/APJ system in EC, including promotion of proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis. Moreover, we also analyze the role of apelin/APJ on endothelial dysfunction-related diseases including atherosclerosis, diabetes, hypertension, and myocardial infarction. Finally, we summarize the most commonly used agonists and antagonists of APJ.

Here, we aimed to reveal the underlying pathophysiology association between the T2D and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and, therefore, to find the possible therapeutic targets in the occurrence and development of HCC. The methylation microarray data of T2D and HCC were extracted from the Gene Expression Omnibus and The Cancer Genome Atlas. A total of 504 differentially methylated genes (DMGs) between T2D samples and the controls were identified, whereas 6269 DMGs were identified between HCC samples and the control groups. There were 336 DMGs coexisting in diabetes and HCC, among which 86 genes were comethylated genes. These genes were mostly enriched in pathways as glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis, fatty acid, and metabolic pathway as glycosaminoglycan degradation and thiamine, fructose and mannose. There were 250 DMGs that had differential methylation direction between T2D DMGs and HCC DMGs, and these genes were enriched in the Sphingolipid metabolism pathway and immune pathways through natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity and ak-STAT signaling pathway. Eight genes were found related to the occurrence and development of diabetes and HCC. Moreover, the result of protein-protein interaction network showed that CDKN1A gene was related to the prognosis of HCC. In summary, eight genes were found to be associated with the development of HCC and CDKN1A may serve as the potential prognostic gene for HCC.",Purple sweet potato color attenuated NLRP3 inflammasome by inducing autophagy to delay endothelial senescence.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30585631,Journal of cellular physiology,2019 01 23,"Autophagy is a vital negative factor regulating cellular senescence. Purple sweet potato color (PSPC), one type of flavonoid, has been demonstrated to suppress endothelial senescence and restore endothelial function in diabetic mice by inhibiting the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain, leucine rich repeat and pyrin domain containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome. However, the roles of autophagy in the inflammatory response during endothelial senescence are unknown. Here, we found that PSPC augmented autophagy to restrict high-glucose-induced premature endothelial senescence. In addition, PSPC administration impaired endothelium aging in diabetic mice by increasing autophagy. Inhibition of autophagy accelerated endothelial senescence, while enhancement of autophagy delayed senescence. Moreover, deactivation of the NLRP3 inflammasome triggered by PSPC was autophagy-dependent. Autophagy receptor microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 and p62 interacted with the inflammasome component NLRP3, suggesting that autophagosomes target the NLRP3 inflammasome and deliver it to the lysosome for degradation. Altogether, PSPC amplified cellular autophagy, subsequently attenuated NLRP3 inflammasome activity and finally delayed endothelial senescence to ameliorate cardiovascular complication. These results suggest a potential therapeutic target in senescence-related cardiovascular diseases.",Surgical treatment of glottic web using butterfly mucosal flap technique: Experience on 12 patients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30585630,The Laryngoscope,2019 05 17,"Many surgical methods have been described for the treatment of glottic web, with very little experience of each.

Using the autopolyploid Dianthus broteri complex (2×, 4×, 6× and 12×) as a model, we aimed to integrate three scenarios - competitive exclusion, recurrent origins of cytotypes and niche filling - into a single framework of polyploid niche evolution. We hypothesized that high polyploids would tend to evolve towards extreme niches when low ploidy cytotypes have nearly filled the niche space. We used several ecoinformatics and phylogenetic comparative analyses to quantify differences in the ecological niche of each cytotype and to evaluate alternative models of niche evolution. Each cytotype in this complex occupied a distinct ecological niche. The distributions were mainly constrained by soil characteristics, temperature and drought stress imposed by the Mediterranean climate. Tetraploids had the highest niche breadth and overlap due to their multiple origins, whereas the higher ploidy cytotypes were found in different, restricted, nonoverlapping niches. Niche evolution analyses suggested a scenario with one niche optimum for each ploidy, including the two independent tetraploid lineages. Our results suggest that the fate of nascent polyploids could not be predicted without accounting for phylogenetic relatedness, recurrent origins or the niche occupied by ancestors.",Family Stress Processes and Children's Self-Regulation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30585628,Child development,2018 12 26,"Economic hardship can affect children's development through child-caregiver interactions, which may mediate cascading effects of other family stress processes.

We attempt to understand change over time in the experience of these constructs among YSMM. Data were taken from a diverse community-based sample of YSMM (N = 450, baseline mean age 18.93) surveyed every 6 months for 2.5 years. Multilevel modeling was used to model within-person change in victimization, internalizing symptoms, externalizing symptoms, alcohol frequency, marijuana use, and illicit drug use. We tested the indirect effect of concurrent and time-lagged victimization on the association between age and mental health and substance use. Victimization, internalizing symptoms, and externalizing symptoms decreased over time. Concurrent victimization was associated with higher internalizing symptoms, externalizing symptoms, alcohol use, marijuana use, and illicit drug use. Analysis of indirect effects suggested that the association between victimization and mental health and substance use outcomes decreased as participants transitioned from adolescence into adulthood. This study found that the reduction in victimization that YSMM experience as they grow older is associated with a reduction in negative mental health and substance use outcomes. Prevention efforts to limit victimization exposure may reduce health disparities for YSMM.",The impact of childhood trauma and psychophysiological reactivity on at-risk women's adjustment to parenthood.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30585566,Development and psychopathology,2018 12 26,"Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) have an impact on women's adaptation to parenthood, but mechanisms are poorly understood.

Parenting self-efficacy, anxiety, and depressive symptoms were measured during pregnancy and 1 year after giving birth. Harsh discipline was measured 2 years after giving birth. Structural equation modeling was employed to test whether baseline PEP and RSA and reactivity mediated links between ACEs and postnatal outcomes, adjusted for prenatal variables. High ACEs predicted less RSA reactivity (p = .02), which subsequently predicted increases in depressive symptoms (p = .03). The indirect effect was not significant (p = .06). There was no indirect link between high ACEs and harsh parenting through PEP nor RSA (n = 98).

This study evaluated the average use of two ER strategies (cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression) and concurrent and lagged relationships between these two ER strategies and affect (positive and negative affect) in the daily lives of adolescents. We also investigated the role of the same strategies at the trait level on these within-person relationships. Thirty-three adolescents provided 1,258 reports of their daily life by using the Experience Sampling Method for one week. Regarding the relative use of ER strategies, cognitive reappraisal (M = 2.87, SD = 1.58) was used more often than expressive suppression (M = 2.42, SD = 1.21). While the use of both strategies was positively correlated when evaluated in daily life (p = .01), the same did not occur at the trait level (p = .37). Multilevel analysis found that ER strategies were concurrently related to affect (p &lt; .01), with the exception of cognitive reappraisal-positive affect relationship (p = .11). However, cognitive reappraisal predicted higher positive affect at the subsequent sampling moment ( β = 0.07, p = .03). The concurrent associations between cognitive reappraisal and negative affect vary as function of the use of this strategy at the trait level (β = 0.05, p = .02). Our findings highlighted the complex associations between daily ER strategies and affect of a normative sample of adolescents.","Childhood adversity, externalizing behavior, and substance use in adolescence: Mediating effects of anterior cingulate cortex activation during inhibitory errors.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30585564,Development and psychopathology,2019 01 07,"Childhood adversity can negatively impact development across various domains, including physical and mental health. Adverse childhood experiences have been linked to aggression and substance use; however, developmental pathways to explain these associations are not well characterized. Understanding early precursors to later problem behavior and substance use can inform preventive interventions. The aim of the current study was to examine neurobiological pathways through which childhood adversity may lead to early adolescent problem behavior and substance use in late adolescence by testing two prospective models. Our first model found that early adolescent externalizing behavior mediates the association between childhood adversity and alcohol, cigarette, and marijuana use in late adolescence. Our second model found that activation in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) during an inhibitory control task mediates the association between childhood adversity and early adolescent externalizing behavior, with lower ACC activation associated with higher levels of adversity and more externalizing behavior. Together these findings indicate that the path to substance use in late adolescence from childhood adversity may operate through lower functioning in the ACC related to inhibitory control and externalizing behavior. Early life stressors should be considered an integral component in the etiology and prevention of early and problematic substance use.",The course of maternal repetitive negative thinking at the transition to motherhood and early mother-infant interactions: Is there a link?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30585563,Development and psychopathology,2018 12 26,"Potential long-term associations between repetitive negative thinking and mother-infant interactions have received little attention. The current longitudinal study including N = 62 mother-infant dyads investigated both maternal and infant behavior in face-to-face interactions as a function of pre- and postnatal maternal repetitive negative thinking when infants were aged around 4 months. We hypothesised that mothers with a strong tendency to engage in repetitive negative thinking would react less contingently to their infants' behavior compared to mothers with a weak tendency to engage in repetitive negative thinking. Furthermore, we hypothesised that infants of mothers high in repetitive negative thinking would differ from infants of mothers low in repetitive negative thinking in their reactions in the still-face task. Contrary to expectations, there was no difference in maternal contingency between mothers high versus low in repetitive negative thinking. However, infant behavior in the still-face task differed as a function of maternal repetitive negative thinking status. Specifically, infants of mothers high in repetitive negative thinking spent more time with object/environment engagement than infants of mothers who were low in repetitive negative thinking, and they also protested less frequently. These findings are discussed in terms of their relevance for the intergenerational transmission of mental disorders.",'At risk mental state' clinics for psychosis - an idea whose time has come - and gone!,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30585562,Psychological medicine,2018 12 26,"At Risk Mental State (ARMS) clinics are specialised mental health services for young, help-seeking people, thought to be at ultra-high risk of developing psychosis. Their stated purpose is to reduce transitions from the ARMS state to clinical psychotic disorder. Reports of ARMS clinics provide 'evidence-based recommendations' or 'guidance' for the treatment of such individuals, and claim that such clinics prevent the development of psychosis. However, we note that in an area with a very well-developed ARMS clinic (South London), only a very small proportion (4%) of patients with first episode psychosis had previously been seen at this clinic with symptoms of the ARMS. We conclude that the task of reaching sufficient people to make a major contribution to the prevention of psychosis is beyond the power of ARMS clinics. Following the preventative approaches used for many medical disorders (e.g. lung cancer, coronary artery disease), we consider that a more effective way of preventing psychosis will be to adopt a public health approach; this should attempt to decrease exposure to environmental factors such as cannabis use which are known to increase risk of the disorder.",Shone's complex in a patient with chromosome 9q34.3 deletion (Kleefstra syndrome).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30585561,Cardiology in the young,2018 12 26,"Kleefstra syndrome (chromosome 9q34.3 deletion) is a rare genetic disorder with less than 110 patients reported till date.

The incidence of CRC is strongly influenced by nutrition and the high fat/high carbohydrate Western-style diet. CRC is one of the most intensively studied cancer types, partly because of its high prevalence, but also because of the existence of its precursor lesions, tubular or villous adenomas, and more recently serrated adenomas. The morphological steps in the adenomacarcinoma sequence have been elucidated at a molecular level, which allow the identification of the genes responsible for CRC. Review and Conclusions: The main aim of this review is to provide data regarding the pathophysiological characteristics, molecular mechanisms as well as carcinogenic and chemopreventive agents for CRC, with emphasis on evidence supporting their efficacy. These compounds may modulate multiple signaling pathways involved in cell proliferation and apoptosis in transformed cells, they also enhance the host immune system and favor an effective treatment.

In 1986, Charles Hull introduced stereolithography technique that took advances to beget new methods of 3D printing such as powder bed fusion, fused deposition modeling (FDM), inkjet printing, and contour crafting (CC). Being advantageous in terms of less waste, freedom of design and automation, 3DP has been evolved to minimize incurred cost for bulk production of customized products at the industrial outset. Due to these reasons, 3DP technology has acquired a significant position in pharmaceutical industries.

Contrary to older anticoagulants, such as coumadin, when antidotes existed and were broadly used in cases of emergent surgery and bleeding, antidotes for NOACs have not been developed until recently. Moreover, the monitoring of NOAC's anticoagulant effect varies across different hospital settings and the absence of a single test that can accurately predict the degree of anticoagulation achieved increases the uncertainty. These uncertainties often result in management dilemmas for clinicians when patients who are on NOACs need a reversal of anticoagulation. Until recently, available antidotes for NOACs included only prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC), activated prothrombin complex concentrate (aPCC) and recombinant activated factor VII and the less optimal fresh frozen plasma (FFP). Recently though, novel antidotes for NOACs have been developed, including idarucizumab, which is a monoclonal antibody fragment that binds dabigatran, and andexanet alfa, a modified decoy form of the activated factor X (FXa) that binds FXa inhibitors and AT III. Another option, ciraparantag, which is a small molecule that binds to heparin, thrombin inhibitors and FXa inhibitors, is still in phase I development. In this review, we summarize the current evidence and present the available bypassing and novel reversal agents.

In addition, the progression of peripheral artery disease leads to an increased risk of limb loss. In order to reduce these events, the benchmark of treatment and research over the last years has been the antiplatelet therapy which aims at inhibition of platelet aggregation. Over the last years, new studies combining antiplatelet agents in different therapeutic schemes have been proven efficacious. Unfortunately, patients remain still at high risk of CV events. Novel Oral Anticoagulants have been introduced as alternatives to warfarin, in the prevention and treatment of venous thromboembolism. The rationale of using medication which acts on platelet activation and the coagulation pathway of thrombosis has led investigators to examine the role of Noac's in preventing CV events in patients with peripheral artery disease, stable or unstable.",Anticoagulation after Iliofemoral Vein Stenting - Old Versus New.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30585538,Current pharmaceutical design,2019 03 19,"In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in endovascular iliofemoral vein stenting to prevent/ alleviate symptoms related to proximal venous outflow obstruction.

Despite the development of novel treatments for MDD, many patients present with treatment resistant depression (TRD), identified by treatment non-response following one or more adequate trials of an antidepressant. Rapastinel may prove to be a viable treatment for TRD; it has the potential to produce a rapid antidepressant response without serious adverse events and improve functional symptoms. Areas covered: We review the efficacy of rapastinel via completed and on-going clinical trials. The online databases Pubmed, clinicaltrials.gov and clinicaltrialsregister.eu were searched for rapastinel (GLYX-13) treatment in subjects with MDD. Nine clinical trials were identified. Expert opinion: Rapastinel is a novel and potentially transformative treatment for individuals with TRD. There is a limited number of clinical studies so far, but this compound has the potential to provide rapid, reliable and robust antidepressant effects without psychotomimetic and other unwanted side effects. Alternative formulations such as the oral formulation, provide the opportunity for rapastinel to be administered less frequently, i.e. once weekly.

We selected a random sample of 97 participants from a cohort of pregnant participants attending prenatal clinics in Lima, Peru. Each provided a hair sample at enrollment (mean gestational age = 13.1 weeks) and again at full-term delivery. Hair samples were segmented to reflect HCC in preconception and each trimester. At enrollment, measures of stress included: difficulty accessing basic goods, educational attainment, exposure to violence, fair or poor general health, perceived stress, and symptoms of depression, general anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder. Linear mixed models evaluated the association between each stress measure and absolute and relative changes in HCC. Pearson correlation coefficients (r) assessed correlations between HCC and continuous stress scores. Educational attainment of ≤12 years was associated with higher HCC in preconception and the 1st trimester, and general anxiety with lower preconception HCC. When modeling HCC patterns across the 4 hair segments, an educational attainment of ≤12 years was associated with higher HCC, high perceived stress with lower HCC, and general anxiety with steeper increases in HCC (group by time p value = .02). Only preconception HCC and GAD scores correlated (r = -0.22, p = .04). We observed few associations between stress and HCC. However, those that were seen were generally restricted to the preconception and 1st trimester. Further investigations into the association between stress and changes in HCC across pregnancy are warranted, and should include the preconception where possible.",Unusual gait disorders: a phenomenological approach and classification.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30585519,Expert review of neurotherapeutics,2019 02 11,"Gait impairment is a very common problem in clinical practice. Multiple classifications of gait disorders are available based on anatomy, etiology, pathology and phenomenology. These classifications provide a diagnostic guide but do not clearly explain the pathophysiology of some gait disorders, which can sometimes hinder the diagnostic process. In this context, unusual gait disorders become an even more difficult clinical challenge. Areas covered: The scientific and non-scientific literature contains illustrative descriptions of unusual gait disorders based on their predominant signs and/or comparisons with normal and abnormal zoological and folkloric patterns. Unusual gait disorder phenomenology can be carefully deconstructed in order to achieve an integral approach. We present a pragmatic, phenomenological approach to various unusual gait disorders and highlight key features underlying their phenotypes. We also propose unifying terminology to facilitate diagnosis and academic communication. Expert commentary: Advanced gait analysis, neurophysiological and neuroimaging techniques have allowed for us to recognize that locomotion is a complex motor behavior that requires simultaneous integration of multiple neurological and non-neurological systems. A phenomenological approach such as the one proposed in this review could be useful while those objective techniques become more widely available in clinical practice.",Two new stilbenoids from Bletilla striata.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30585518,Journal of Asian natural products research,2019 04 04,"Two new stilbenoids bletilol D (1) and bletilol E (2), together with five known compounds were isolated from Bletilla striata.

We hypothesised patients with elevated digoxin concentrations may derive little benefit from digoxin-Fab because their presenting complaint was more closely related to their multiple co-morbidities. We aimed to compare the outcome of patients who were initially treated with digoxin-Fab with those that received supportive care. Method: Patients were prospectively recruited to the study if they had an elevated digoxin concentration, signs or symptoms of toxicity thought to be from digoxin. Patients who were initially managed with digoxin-Fab were compared with those not initially receiving digoxin-Fab (observation group). Patients presented with ventricular arrhythmias before initial assessment were excluded from the analysis. Primary outcome was mortality. Secondary outcomes were length of stay (LOS), change in heart rate (HR) and potassium concentration. Results: From September 2013 to January 2018, 128 patients were recruited of which 78 (61%) received initial digoxin-Fab. Digoxin-Fab and supportive care groups had an initial median heart rate of 46 (range: 20-120) vs 52 bpm (range: 29-91) (p = .06), systolic blood pressure of 110 mmHg (range: 65-180) vs 125 mmHg (range: 90-184) (p = .009), respectively. Digoxin concentrations 4.4 nmol/L (range: 3.3-9) vs 4.2 (range: 2-11.2) (p = .42) and potassium concentrations 5.4 mmol/L (range: 3-11) vs 5.1 mmol/L (range: 3.5-8.2) (p = .33) were similar. Median dose of digoxin-Fab used was 1.5 vials (IQR: 1-2). There were 9 (12%) deaths in the Fab group compared to 7 (14%) in those treated with supportive care (risk difference -2.5%; 95% CI: -14 to 9%; p = .68). The median LOS was six days in both groups. Mean changes in potassium concentration [-0.5 ± 0.1 vs. -0.4 ± 0.1 mmol/L; difference -0.1 (95% CI: -.02, 0.4), p = .70] and HR within 4 h [8 ± 1 vs. 7 ± 3 bpm; difference -1.0 (95% CI: -6.7, 4.8), p = 0.74] were similar in the two groups. Conclusions: This study did not appear to show any benefit from the routine use of digoxin-Fab in patients thought to have chronic digoxin poisoning. These patients have multiple co-morbidities that may be contributing to their clinical features, other treatments are often equally effective.",Protocatechuic acid protects against menadione-induced liver damage by up-regulating nuclear erythroid-related factor 2.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30585516,Drug and chemical toxicology,2019 01 16,"Menadione (Vitamin K3) is an over-the-counter (OTC) drug used in the treatment of abdominal cramps, colitis, diarrhea, hay fever, hemorrahage, hypoprothrombinemia, and joint pains. In this study, we evaluated the protective influence of protocatechuic acid on menadione-induced hepatotoxicity in rats. Rats were randomized into five groups (A-E) of five rats each. Control rats orally received 1% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) in distilled water (the vehicle for protocatechuic administration) for 7 days. In addition, control rats intraperioneally received olive oil (vehicle for menadione administration) on the 7th day. Groups B, D, and E received single dose of 100 mg/kg body weight menadione on day 7. Furthermore, groups C-E were pretreated with protocatechuic acid for 7 days. Pretreatment of rats with protocatechuic acid significantly halted menadione mediated-alterations in serum alkaline phosphatase, alanine and aspartate aminotransferases, albumin, and total bilirubin. Furthermore, menadione-mediated increase in superoxide ion and hydrogen peroxide with concomitant decrease in the activities of superoxide dismutase and catalase were significantly reversed by protocatechuic acid. Protocatechuic acid annulled menadione-mediated decrease in glutathione S-transferase and NADH: quinone oxidoreductase-1 through nuclear erythroid related factor-2 (Nrf-2). In addition, the decreased glutathione and increased glutathione disulfide, caspase-3, fragmented DNA, malondialdehyde and protein carbonyl were reversed. Results of this study show that protocatechuic acid protects against menadione-induced oxidative stress in rats by enhancing the antioxidant and phase II enzymes through Nrf-2."

Ten resistance-trained males underwent (mean ± SD: age 21.0 ± 1.3 years, height 1.77 ± 0.06 m, and body mass 82.8 ± 14.9 kg) three sessions. These included control morning (M, 07:30 h) and evening (E, 17:30 h) sessions (5-min standardized warm-up at 150 W, on a cycle ergometer), and one further session consisting of an extended active warm-up morning trial (ME, 07:30 h) until rectal temperature (Trec) reached previously recorded resting evening levels (at 150 W, on a cycle ergometer). All sessions included handgrip, followed by a defined program of bench press (at 20, 40, and 60 kg) and back squat (at 30, 50, and 70 kg) exercises. A linear encoder was attached to an Olympic bar used for the exercises and average force (AF), peak velocity (PV), and time to peak velocity (tPV) were measured (MuscleLab software; MuscleLab Technology, Langesund, Norway) during the concentric phase of the movements. Values for Trec were higher in the E session compared to values in the M session (Δ0.53 °C, P < 0.0005). Following the extended active warm-up in the morning (ME), Trec and Tm values were no different to the E values (P < 0.05). Values for Tm were lower in the M compared to the E condition throughout (P < 0.05). There were time-of-day effects for hand grip with higher values of 6.49% for left (P = 0.05) and 4.61% for right hand (P = 0.002) in the E compared to the M. Daily variations were apparent for both bench press and back squat performance for AF (3.28% and 2.63%), PV (13.64% and 11.50%), and tPV (-16.97% and -14.12%, where a negative number indicates a decrease in the variable from morning to evening). There was a main effect for load (P < 0.0005) such that AF and PV values were larger at higher masses on the bar than lower ones and tPV was smaller at lower masses on the bar than at higher masses for both bench press and back squat. We established that increasing Trec in the M-E values did not result in an increase of any measures related to bench press and back squat performance (P > 0.05) to increase from M to E levels. Therefore, MuscleLab linear encoder could detect meaningful differences between the morning and evening for all variables. However, the diurnal variation in bench press and back squat (measures of lower and upper body force and power output) is not explained by time-of-day oscillations in Trec.",The role of self-esteem in Internet addiction within the context of comorbid mental disorders: Findings from a general population-based sample.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30585501,Journal of behavioral addictions,2019 02 28,"Internet Addiction (IA) has consistently been related to comorbid psychiatric disorders and lowered self-esteem.

Moreover, in children with duodenal ulcer, H. pylori prevalence was higher (47.4%) compared with the rest (23.9%). On the contrary, the infection was detected 1.9-fold less frequently in patients with GERD (14.5%) compared with the other (27.0%) patients and 2.1-fold less often in the presence of duodenogastric reflux (bile) reflux (13.0%) compared with the absence of the reflux (27.0%).
