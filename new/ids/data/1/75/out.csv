Whereas a plethora of studies dealt with the risk of injury and death associated with downhill skiing, data on its favorable health effects are scarce. A more comprehensive overview on such effects might emerge from a multidisciplinary perspective. Methods: A literature search has been performed to identify original articles on downhill/alpine skiing interventions or questionnaire-based evaluation of skiing effects and the assessment of health effects (cardiorespiratory, neurophysiological, musculoskeletal, psycho-social). Results and Discussion: A total of 21 original articles dealing with potentially favorable health effects resulting from downhill skiing were included in this review. Results indicate that downhill skiing, especially when performed on a regular basis, may contribute to healthy aging by its association with a healthier life style including higher levels of physical activity. Several other mechanisms suggest further favorable health effects of downhill skiing in response to specific challenges and adaptations in the musculo-skeletal and postural control systems, to exposures to cold temperatures and intermittent hypoxia, and/or emotional and social benefits from outdoor recreation. However, reliable data corroborating these mechanisms is scarce.",Normal Ribosomal Biogenesis but Shortened Protein Synthetic Response to Acute Eccentric Resistance Exercise in Old Skeletal Muscle.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30692935,Frontiers in physiology,2019 02 02,"Anabolic resistance to feeding in aged muscle is well-characterized; however, whether old skeletal muscle is intrinsically resistant to acute mechanical loading is less clear. The aim of this study was to determine the impact of aging on muscle protein synthesis (MPS), ribosome biogenesis, and protein breakdown in skeletal muscle following a single bout of resistance exercise. Adult male F344/BN rats aged 10 (Adult) and 30 (Old) months underwent unilateral maximal eccentric contractions of the hindlimb. Precursor rRNA increased early post-exercise (6-18 h), preceding elevations in ribosomal mass at 48 h in Adult and Old; there were no age-related differences in these responses. MPS increased early post-exercise in both Adult and Old; however, at 48 h of recovery, MPS returned to baseline in Old but not Adult. This abbreviated protein synthesis response in Old was associated with decreased levels of IRS1 protein and increased BiP, CHOP and eIF2α levels. Other than these responses, anabolic signaling was similar in Adult and Old muscle in the acute recovery phase. Basal proteasome activity was lower in Old, and resistance exercise did not increase the activity of either the ATP-dependent or independent proteasome, or autophagy (Cathepsin L activity) in either Adult or Old muscle. We conclude that MPS and ribosome biogenesis in response to maximal resistance exercise in old skeletal muscle are initially intact; however, the MPS response is abbreviated in Old, which may be the result of ER stress and/or blunted exercise-induced potentiation of the MPS response to feeding.",Patient-Specific Identification of Atrial Flutter Vulnerability-A Computational Approach to Reveal Latent Reentry Pathways.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30692934,Frontiers in physiology,2019 02 01,"Atypical atrial flutter (AFlut) is a reentrant arrhythmia which patients frequently develop after ablation for atrial fibrillation (AF). Indeed, substrate modifications during AF ablation can increase the likelihood to develop AFlut and it is clinically not feasible to reliably and sensitively test if a patient is vulnerable to AFlut. Here, we present a novel method based on personalized computational models to identify pathways along which AFlut can be sustained in an individual patient. We build a personalized model of atrial excitation propagation considering the anatomy as well as the spatial distribution of anisotropic conduction velocity and repolarization characteristics based on a combination of a priori knowledge on the population level and information derived from measurements performed in the individual patient. The fast marching scheme is employed to compute activation times for stimuli from all parts of the atria. Potential flutter pathways are then identified by tracing loops from wave front collision sites and constricting them using a geometric snake approach under consideration of the heterogeneous wavelength condition. In this way, all pathways along which AFlut can be sustained are identified. Flutter pathways can be instantiated by using an eikonal-diffusion phase extrapolation approach and a dynamic multifront fast marching simulation. In these dynamic simulations, the initial pattern eventually turns into the one driven by the dominant pathway, which is the only pathway that can be observed clinically. We assessed the sensitivity of the flutter pathway maps with respect to conduction velocity and its anisotropy. Moreover, we demonstrate the application of tailored models considering disease-specific repolarization properties (healthy, AF-remodeled, potassium channel mutations) as well as applicabiltiy on a clinical dataset. Finally, we tested how AFlut vulnerability of these substrates is modulated by exemplary antiarrhythmic drugs (amiodarone, dronedarone). Our novel method allows to assess the vulnerability of an individual patient to develop AFlut based on the personal anatomical, electrophysiological, and pharmacological characteristics. In contrast to clinical electrophysiological studies, our computational approach provides the means to identify all possible AFlut pathways and not just the currently dominant one. This allows to consider all relevant AFlut pathways when tailoring clinical ablation therapy in order to reduce the development and recurrence of AFlut.",Non-reversible and Reversible Heat Tolerance Plasticity in Tropical Intertidal Animals: Responding to Habitat Temperature Heterogeneity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30692933,Frontiers in physiology,2019 02 01,"The theory for thermal plasticity of tropical ectotherms has centered on terrestrial and open-water marine animals which experience reduced variation in diurnal and seasonal temperatures, conditions constraining plasticity selection. Tropical marine intertidal animals, however, experience complex habitat thermal heterogeneity, circumstances encouraging thermal plasticity selection. Using the tropical rocky-intertidal gastropod, Echinolittorina malaccana, we investigated heat tolerance plasticity in terms of laboratory acclimation and natural acclimatization of populations from thermally-dissimilar nearby shorelines. Laboratory treatments yielded similar capacities of snails from either population to acclimate their lethal thermal limit (LT50 variation was ∼2°C). However, the populations differed in the temperature range over which acclimatory adjustments could be made; LT50 plasticity occurred over a higher temperature range in the warm-shore snails compared to the cool-shore snails, giving an overall acclimation capacity for the populations combined of 2.9°C. In addition to confirming significant heat tolerance plasticity in tropical intertidal animals, these findings reveal two plasticity forms, reversible (laboratory acclimation) and non-reversible (population or shoreline specific) plasticity. The plasticity forms should account for different spatiotemporal scales of the environmental temperature variation; reversible plasticity for daily and tidal variations in microhabitat temperature and non-reversible plasticity for lifelong, shoreline temperature conditions. Non-reversible heat tolerance plasticity, likely established after larvae settle on the shore, should be energetically beneficial in preventing heat shock protein overexpression, but also should facilitate widespread colonization of coasts that support thermally-diverse shorelines. This first demonstration of different plasticity forms in benthic intertidal animals supports the hypothesis that habitat heterogeneity (irrespective of latitude) drives thermal plasticity selection. It further suggests that studies not making reference to different spatial scales of thermal heterogeneity, nor seeking how these may drive different thermal plasticity forms, risk misinterpreting ectothermic responses to environmental warming.",In silico Identification and Expression of Protocadherin Gene Family in Octopus vulgaris.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30692932,Frontiers in physiology,2019 02 01,"Connecting millions of neurons to create a functional neural circuit is a daunting challenge. Vertebrates developed a molecular system at the cell membrane to allow neurons to recognize each other by distinguishing self from non-self through homophilic protocadherin interactions. In mammals, the protocadherin gene family counts about 50 different genes. By hetero-multimerization, protocadherins are capable of generating an impressive number of molecular interfaces. Surprisingly, in the California two-spot octopus, Octopus bimaculoides, an invertebrate belonging to the Phylum Mollusca, over 160 protocadherins (PCDHs) have been identified. Here we briefly discuss the role of PCDHs in neural wiring and conduct a comparative study of the protocadherin gene family in two closely related octopus species, Octopus vulgaris and O. bimaculoides. A first glance at the expression patterns of protocadherins in O. vulgaris is also provided. Finally, we comment on PCDH evolution in the light of invertebrate nervous system plasticity.",Supplementing Maturation Medium With Insulin Growth Factor I and Vitrification-Warming Solutions With Reduced Glutathione Enhances Survival Rates and Development Ability of in vitro Matured Vitrified-Warmed Pig Oocytes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30692931,Frontiers in physiology,2019 02 01,"The present study sought to determine whether in vitro maturation (IVM) of pig oocytes in a medium supplemented with insulin growth factor-I (IGF-I) and subsequent vitrification with or without reduced glutathione (GSH) affect their quality and developmental competence, and the expression of genes involved in antioxidant, apoptotic and stress responses. In Experiment 1, cumulus-oocyte complexes were matured in the absence or presence of IGF-I (100 ng·mL-1) and then vitrified-warmed with or without 2 mM of GSH. Maturation rate was evaluated before vitrification, and oocyte viability, DNA fragmentation and relative transcript abundances of BCL-2-associated X protein (BAX), BCL2-like1 (BCL2L1), heat shock protein 70 (HSPA1A), glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPX1) and superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) genes were assessed in fresh and vitrified-warmed oocytes. In Experiment 2, fresh and vitrified-warmed oocytes were in vitro fertilized and their developmental competence determined. Whereas the addition of IGF-I to maturation medium had no effect on oocyte maturation, it caused an increase in the survival rate of vitrified-warmed oocytes. This effect was accompanied by a concomitant augment in the relative transcript abundance of HSPA1A and a decrease of BAX. Furthermore, the addition of GSH to vitrification-warming media increased survival rates at post-warming. Likewise, the action of GSH was concomitant with an increase in the relative abundance of GPX1 and a decrease of BAX transcript. Blastocyst rates of vitrified-warmed oocytes did not differ from their fresh counterparts when IGF-I and GSH were combined. In conclusion, supplementing maturation medium with 100 ng·mL-1 IGF-I and vitrification-warming solutions with 2 mM GSH improves the quality and cryotolerance of IVM pig oocytes, through a mechanism that involves BAX, GPX1 and HSPA1A expression.","Cortisol Acting Through the Glucocorticoid Receptor Is Not Involved in Exercise-Enhanced Growth, But Does Affect the White Skeletal Muscle Transcriptome in Zebrafish (Danio rerio).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30692930,Frontiers in physiology,2019 02 01,"Forced sustained swimming exercise at optimal speed enhances growth in many fish species, particularly through hypertrophy of the white skeletal muscle. The exact mechanism of this effect has not been resolved yet. To explore the role of cortisol, we first subjected wild-type zebrafish to an exercise protocol validated for exercise-enhanced growth, and showed that exercised zebrafish, which indeed showed enhanced growth, had higher cortisol levels than the non-exercised controls. A central role was therefore hypothesized for the steroid hormone cortisol acting through the Glucocorticoid receptor (Gr). Second, we subjected wild-type zebrafish and zebrafish with a mutant Gr to exercise at optimal, suboptimal, and super-optimal speeds and compared them with non-exercised controls. Exercised zebrafish showed growth enhancement at all speeds, with highest growth at optimal speeds. In the Gr mutant fish, exercise resulted in growth enhancement similar to wild-type zebrafish, indicating that cortisol signaling through Gr cannot be considered as a main determinant of exercise-enhanced growth. Finally, the transcriptome of white skeletal muscle tissue was analyzed by RNA sequencing. The results of this analysis showed that in the muscle tissue of Gr mutant fish a lower number of genes is regulated by exercise than in wild-type fish (183 vs. 351). A cluster of 36 genes was regulated by exercise in both wild-type and mutant fish, and in this cluster genes involved in transcriptional regulation and protein ubiquitination were overrepresented. Because these two processes appear to be regulated in both wild type and mutant fish, which both display exercise-enhanced growth, we suggest that they play an important role in the growth of muscles upon exercise.",Short-Term Exercise Training Inconsistently Influences Basal Testosterone in Older Men: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30692929,Frontiers in physiology,2019 02 01,"Background: The age-associated decrease in testosterone is one mechanism suggested to accelerate the aging process in males. Therefore, approaches to increase endogenous testosterone may be of benefit. The aim of this paper was to undertake a Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA)-accordant meta-analysis concerning the effect of exercise on total (TT), bioavailable (bio-T), free (free-T), and salivary (sal-T) testosterone in older males. Methods: Databases were searched up to and including 20th February 2018 for the terms ""testosterone AND exercise AND aging AND males,"" ""testosterone AND exercise AND old AND males,"" ""testosterone AND training AND aging AND males,"" and ""testosterone AND training AND old AND males"". From 1259 originally identified titles, 22 studies (randomized controlled trials; RCTs; n = 9, and uncontrolled trials; UCTs; n = 13) were included which had a training component, participants ≥60 years of age, and salivary or serum testosterone as an outcome measure. Meta-analyses were conducted on change to testosterone following training using standardized difference in means (SDM) and random effects models. Results: The overall SDM for endurance training, resistance training, and interval training was 0.398 (95% CI = 0.034-0.761; P = 0.010), -0.003 (95% CI = -0.330-0.324; P = 0.986), and 0.283 (95% CI = 0.030-0.535; P = 0.028), respectively. Resistance training exhibited a qualitative effect of hormone fraction whereby free-T resulted in the greatest SDM (0.253; 95% CI = -0.043-0.549; P = 0.094), followed by TT (0.028; 95% CI = -0.204-0.260; P = 0.813), and resistance training negatively influenced bio-T (-0.373; 95% CI = -0.789-0.042; P = 0.078). Due to the small number of studies, subgroup analysis was not possible for endurance training and interval training studies. Conclusions: Data from the present investigation suggests that resistance training does not significantly influence basal testosterone in older men. Magnitude of effect was influenced by hormone fraction, even within the same investigation. Aerobic training and interval training did result in small, significant increases in basal testosterone. The magnitude of effect is small but the existing data are encouraging and may be an avenue for further research.",Heart Rhythm Insights Into Structural Remodeling in Atrial Tissue: Timed Automata Approach.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30692928,Frontiers in physiology,2019 02 01,"The heart rhythm of a person following heart transplantation (HTX) is assumed to display an intrinsic cardiac rhythm because it is significantly less influenced by the autonomic nervous system-the main source of heart rate variability in healthy people. Therefore, such a rhythm provides evidence for arrhythmogenic processes developing, usually silently, in the cardiac tissue. A model is proposed to simulate alterations in the cardiac tissue and to observe the effects of these changes on the resulting heart rhythm. The hybrid automata framework used makes it possible to represent reliably and simulate efficiently both the electrophysiology of a cardiac cell and the tissue organization. The curve fitting method used in the design of the hybrid automaton cycle follows the well-recognized physiological phases of the atrial myocyte membrane excitation. Moreover, knowledge of the complex architecture of the right atrium, the ability of the almost free design of intercellular connections makes the automata approach the only one possible. Two particular aspects are investigated: impairment of the impulse transmission between cells and structural changes in intercellular connections. The first aspect models the observed fatigue of cells due to specific cardiac tissue diseases. The second aspect simulates the increase in collagen deposition with aging. Finally, heart rhythms arising from the model are validated with the sinus heart rhythms recorded in HTX patients. The modulation in the impairment of the impulse transmission between cells reveals qualitatively the abnormally high heart rate variability observed in patients living long after HTX.",Deficiency of Soluble Epoxide Hydrolase Protects Cardiac Function Impaired by LPS-Induced Acute Inflammation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30692927,Frontiers in pharmacology,2019 02 01,"Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a bacterial wall endotoxin producing many pathophysiological conditions including myocardial inflammation leading to cardiotoxicity. Linoleic acid (18:2n6, LA) is an essential n-6 PUFA which is converted to arachidonic acid (20:4n6, AA) by desaturation and elongation via enzyme systems within the body. Biological transformation of PUFA through CYP-mediated hydroxylation, epoxidation, and allylic oxidation produces lipid mediators, which may be subsequently hydrolyzed to corresponding diol metabolites by soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH). In the current study, we investigate whether inhibition of sEH, which alters the PUFA metabolite profile, can influence LPS induced cardiotoxicity and mitochondrial function. Our data demonstrate that deletion of soluble epoxide hydrolase provides protective effects against LPS-induced cardiotoxicity by maintaining mitochondrial function. There was a marked alteration in the cardiac metabolite profile with notable increases in sEH-derived vicinal diols, 9,10- and 12,13-dihydroxyoctadecenoic acid (DiHOME) in WT hearts following LPS administration, which was absent in sEH null mice. We found that DiHOMEs triggered pronounced mitochondrial structural abnormalities, which also contributed to the development of extensive mitochondrial dysfunction in cardiac cells. Accumulation of DiHOMEs may represent an intermediate mechanism through which LPS-induced acute inflammation triggers deleterious alterations in the myocardium in vivo and cardiac cells in vitro. This study reveals novel research exploring the contribution of DiHOMEs in the progression of adverse inflammatory responses toward cardiac function in vitro and in vivo."

Chronic EtOH consumption impairs motor learning by modulating the cerebellar circuitry synaptic transmission and long-term plasticity. Under in vitro conditions, acute EtOH inhibits both parallel fiber (PF) and climbing fiber (CF) long-term depression (LTD). However, thus far it has not been investigated how chronic EtOH consumption affects sensory stimulation-evoked LTD at the molecular layer interneurons (MLIs) to the Purkinje cell (PC) synapses (MLI-PC LTD) in the cerebellar cortex of living animals. In this study, we investigated the effect of chronic EtOH consumption on facial stimulation-evoked MLI-PC LTD, using an electrophysiological technique as well as pharmacological methods, in urethane-anesthetized mice. Our results showed that facial stimulation induced MLI-PC LTD in the control mice, but it could not be induced in mice with chronic EtOH consumption (0.8 g/kg; 28 days). Blocking the cannabinoid type 1 (CB1) receptor activity with AM-251, prevented MLI-PC LTD in the control mice, but revealed a nitric oxide (NO)-dependent long-term potentiation (LTP) of MLI-PC synaptic transmission (MLI-PC LTP) in the EtOH consumption mice. Notably, with the application of a NO donor, S-nitroso-N-Acetyl-D, L-penicillamine (SNAP) alone prevented the induction of MLI-PC LTD, but a mixture of SNAP and AM-251 revealed an MLI-PC LTP in control mice. In contrast, inhibiting NO synthase (NOS) revealed the facial stimulation-induced MLI-PC LTD in EtOH consumption mice. These results indicate that long-term EtOH consumption can impair the sensory stimulation-induced MLI-PC LTD via the activation of a NO signaling pathway in the cerebellar cortex in vivo in mice. Our results suggest that the chronic EtOH exposure causes a deficit in the cerebellar motor learning function and may be involved in the impaired MLI-PC GABAergic synaptic plasticity.",A Flow Cytometry-Based Approach for the Isolation and Characterization of Neural Stem Cell Primary Cilia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30692915,Frontiers in cellular neuroscience,2019 02 01,"In the adult mammalian brain, the apical surface of the subependymal zone (SEZ) is covered by many motile ependymal cilia and a few primary cilia originating from rare intermingled neural stem cells (NSCs). In NSCs the primary cilia are key for the transduction of essential extracellular signals such as Sonic hedgehog (SHH) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). Despite their importance, the analysis of NSC primary cilia is greatly hampered by the fact that they are overwhelmingly outnumbered by the motile cilia. We here take advantage of flow cytometry to purify the two cilia types and allow their molecular characterization. Primary cilia were identified based on immunoreactivity to the marker adenylate cyclase type III (AC3) and differential levels of prominin-1 whereas motile cilia displayed immunoreactivity only to the latter. Consistent with the morphological differences between the two classes of cilia, enrichment of motile cilia positively correlated with size. Moreover, we observed age-dependent variations in the abundance of the two groups of ciliary organelles reflecting the changes associated with their development. The two cilia groups also differed with respect to the expression of signaling molecules, since PDGF receptor (PDGFR)α, smoothened (Smo) and CXC chemokine receptor (CXCR)4 were only detected in isolated primary but not motile cilia. Thus, our novel method of cilia isolation and characterization by flow cytometry has the potential to be extended to the study of cilia from different tissues and organs, providing a powerful tool for the investigation of primary cilia in physiological and pathological conditions.",Sirtuin 1 and Autophagy Attenuate Cisplatin-Induced Hair Cell Death in the Mouse Cochlea and Zebrafish Lateral Line.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30692914,Frontiers in cellular neuroscience,2019 02 01,"Cisplatin-induced ototoxicity is one of the major adverse effects in cisplatin chemotherapy, and hearing protective approaches are unavailable in clinical practice. Recent work unveiled a critical role of autophagy in cell survival in various types of hearing loss. Since the excessive activation of autophagy can contribute to apoptotic cell death, whether the activation of autophagy increases or decreases the rate of cell death in CDDP ototoxicity is still being debated. In this study, we showed that CDDP induced activation of autophagy in the auditory cell HEI-OC1 at the early stage. We then used rapamycin, an autophagy activator, to increase the autophagy activity, and found that the cell death significantly decreased after CDDP injury. In contrast, treatment with the autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine (3-MA) significantly increased cell death. In accordance with in vitro results, rapamycin alleviated CDDP-induced death of hair cells in zebrafish lateral line and cochlear hair cells in mice. Notably, we found that CDDP-induced increase of Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) in the HEI-OC1 cells modulated the autophagy function. The specific SIRT1 activator SRT1720 could successfully protect against CDDP-induced cell loss in HEI-OC1 cells, zebrafish lateral line, and mice cochlea. These findings suggest that SIRT1 and autophagy activation can be suggested as potential therapeutic strategies for the treatment of CDDP-induced ototoxicity.",Herpes Simplex Virus Type 1 Enhances Expression of the Synaptic Protein Arc for Its Own Benefit.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30692913,Frontiers in cellular neuroscience,2019 02 01,"Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) is a neurotropic virus able to reach the central nervous system (CNS) after primary infection in oronasal mucosa. HSV-1 establishes latency inside neurons due the repression of its gene expression process, which is related to periodic reactivations in response to cellular stress conditions, constituting a risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). The immediate-early gene Arc plays an essential role in neuronal morphology, synaptic plasticity and memory formation. Arc acts as a hub protein, interacting with components of the endocytic machinery required for AMPA receptor (AMPAR) recycling as well as with proteins of the post-synaptic density and actin cytoskeleton. However, to date, no studies have evaluated whether persistent neurotropic HSV-1 infection modulates the expression or function of Arc protein in brain tissue. Here, we report that neuronal in vivo and in vitro infection of HSV-1 significantly increases Arc protein levels, showing a robust perinuclear distribution in neuronal cell lines, a process that is dependent on an active HSV-1 replication cycle. Finally, we found that silencing Arc protein caused a decrease in HSV-1 proteins and viral progeny, suggesting that Arc is involved in the lifecycle of HSV-1. Our studies strongly suggest that pathogenicity of HSV-1 neuronal reactivations in humans could be mediated in part by Arc neuronal upregulation and its potential role in endocytic trafficking and AMPA-neuronal function impairment. Further studies are necessary to define whether this phenomenon could have repercussions in cognition and learning processes in infected individuals.",Circular RNA Expression Alteration and Bioinformatics Analysis in Rats After Traumatic Spinal Cord Injury.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30692912,Frontiers in molecular neuroscience,2019 02 01,"Spinal cord injury (SCI) is mostly caused by trauma. As primary mechanical injury is unavoidable in SCI, a focus on the pathophysiology and underlying molecular mechanisms of SCI-induced secondary injury is necessary to develop promising treatments for SCI patients. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are associated with various diseases. Nevertheless, studies to date have not yet determined the functional roles of circRNAs in traumatic SCI. We examined circRNA expression profiles in the contused spinal cords of rats using microarray and quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) then predict their potential roles in post-SCI pathophysiology with bioinformatics. We found a total of 1676 differentially expressed circRNAs (fold change ≥ 2.0; P < 0.05) in spinal cord 3 days after contusion using circRNA microarray; 1261 circRNAs were significantly downregulated, whereas the remaining 415 were significantly upregulated. Then, five selected circRNAs, namely, rno_circRNA_005342, rno_circRNA_015513, rno_circRNA_002948, rno_circRNA_006096, and rno_circRNA_013017 were all significantly downregulated in the SCI group after verification by qRT-PCR, demonstrating a similar expression pattern in both microarray and PCR data. The next section of the study was concerned with the prediction of circRNA/miRNA/mRNA interactions using bioinformatics analysis. In the final part of the study, Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analyses indicated carbohydrate metabolic process was one of the most significant enrichments and meaningful terms after GO analysis, and the top two signaling pathways affected by the circRNAs-miRNAs axes were the AMP-activated protein kinase signaling pathway and the peroxisome related pathway. In summary, this study showed an altered circRNA expression pattern that may be involved in physiological and pathological processes in rats after traumatic SCI, providing deep insights into numerous possibilities for SCI treatment targets by regulating circRNAs.",Common CHD8 Genomic Targets Contrast With Model-Specific Transcriptional Impacts of CHD8 Haploinsufficiency.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30692911,Frontiers in molecular neuroscience,2019 02 02,"The packaging of DNA into chromatin determines the transcriptional potential of cells and is central to eukaryotic gene regulation. Case sequencing studies have revealed mutations to proteins that regulate chromatin state, known as chromatin remodeling factors, with causal roles in neurodevelopmental disorders. Chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 8 (CHD8) encodes a chromatin remodeling factor with among the highest de novo loss-of-function mutation rates in patients with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, mechanisms associated with CHD8 pathology have yet to be elucidated. We analyzed published transcriptomic data across CHD8 in vitro and in vivo knockdown and knockout models and CHD8 binding across published ChIP-seq datasets to identify convergent mechanisms of gene regulation by CHD8. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) across models varied, but overlap was observed between downregulated genes involved in neuronal development and function, cell cycle, chromatin dynamics, and RNA processing, and between upregulated genes involved in metabolism and immune response. Considering the variability in transcriptional changes and the cells and tissues represented across ChIP-seq analysis, we found a surprisingly consistent set of high-affinity CHD8 genomic interactions. CHD8 was enriched near promoters of genes involved in basic cell functions and gene regulation. Overlap between high-affinity CHD8 targets and DEGs shows that reduced dosage of CHD8 directly relates to decreased expression of cell cycle, chromatin organization, and RNA processing genes, but only in a subset of studies. This meta-analysis verifies CHD8 as a master regulator of gene expression and reveals a consistent set of high-affinity CHD8 targets across human, mouse, and rat in vivo and in vitro studies. These conserved regulatory targets include many genes that are also implicated in ASD.

However, test-retest reliability measurements are essential to ascertain that the longitudinal variations observed are not related to data processing. The aims of this study were to determine the reproducibility of the reconstruction of major white matter fiber bundles of the language network using anatomically constrained probabilistic tractography with constrained spherical deconvolution based on HARDI data, as well as to assess the test-retest reliability of diffusion measures extracted along them. Eighteen right-handed participants were scanned twice, one week apart. The arcuate, inferior longitudinal, inferior fronto-occipital, and uncinate fasciculi were reconstructed in the left and right hemispheres and the following diffusion measures were extracted along each tract: fractional anisotropy, mean, axial, and radial diffusivity, number of fiber orientations, mean length of streamlines, and volume. All fiber bundles showed good morphological overlap between the two scanning timepoints and the test-retest reliability of all diffusion measures in most fiber bundles was good to excellent. We thus propose a fairly simple, but robust, HARDI-based tractography pipeline reliable for the longitudinal study of white matter language fiber bundles, which increases its potential applicability to research on the neurobiological mechanisms supporting language.",A Clinical Report of Two Cases of Cryptogenic Brain Abscess and a Relevant Literature Review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30692909,Frontiers in neuroscience,2019 02 01,"Brain abscess, a severe intracranial infectious disease, refers to the parenchyma abscess caused by local infection or remote spread. Recently, advancements in modern medicine, especially the wide application of antimicrobial drugs, have contributed to the gradual decrease in the prevalence of this disease. However, cases of cryptogenic brain abscess that feature an unknown origin and atypical symptoms are rising. In this retrospective study, we report and analyze two cases of cryptogenic brain abscess. The first patient was a 30-year-old healthy man who was admitted to our hospital due to 1 week of headache and 3 days of headache aggravation, accompanied by nausea and vomiting. Head MRI shows a circular space-occupying as well as apparently enhanced DWI signals were observed in the right parietal lobe, and the ring wall manifested an apparent increase in signal intensity after enhancement. The patient was diagnosed as a brain abscess before operation and given craniotomy. The postoperative pathology confirmed brain abscess and recovered well after surgery. The second patient was a 45-year-old healthy woman who was hospitalized in a local hospital due to symptoms of headache and right limb weakness for 1 week. Head MRI shows a circular space-occupying lesion in the left basal ganglia, and the ring wall manifested an apparent increase in signal intensity after enhancement. The patient was suspected of glioma at the local hospital and was transferred to our hospital. Twelve hours after hospitalization, the patient was suspected of developing cerebral palsy and thus underwent emergency surgery including lesion resection in the left basal ganglia, resection of the polus temporalis, and a decompressive craniotomy. Postoperative pathology confirmed brain abscess. The patient was eventually conscious, but left the right limb hemiplegia. Hence, when a patient develops the classical triad of fever, headache, and focal neurologic deficits, the possibility of brain abscess should be investigated. Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial to minimize various complications and the number of deaths.",Differential Genetic Effect of the Norepinephrine Transporter Promoter Polymorphisms on Attention Problems in Clinical and Non-clinical Samples.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30692908,Frontiers in neuroscience,2019 02 01,"Among the monoaminergic modulatory neurotransmitters, norepinephrine is involved in task orienting, hence noradrenergic genetic variants have been studied in connection to attentional processes. The role of this catecholamine system is also highlighted by the selective norepinephrine transporter blocking atomoxetine, which has proved to be effective in the pharmacological treatment of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). In the present genetic association study three single nucleotide polymorphisms (rs28386840, rs2242446, rs3785143 SNPs) were analyzed from the 5' region of the norepinephrine transporter (NET, SLC6A2) gene, which have been linked to ADHD previously. Attention problems scores of the mother-rated Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) were used in separate analyses of 88 preschoolers (59.1% male, 6 years of age) recruited from the general population and 120 child psychiatry patients with ADHD diagnosis (85.8% male, age: 9.8 ± 2.9). The NET SNPs showed associations with attention problems, but the direction was different in the two groups. Regarding the promoter variant rs28386840, which showed the most consistent association, the T-allele-carrier patients with ADHD had lower CBCL attention problems scores compared to patients with AA genotype (p = 0.023), whereas T-allele-carriers in the community sample had more attention problems (p = 0.042). Based on previous reports of lower NE levels in ADHD children and the inverted-U shape effect of NE on cognitive functions, we propose that rs28386840 (-3081) T-allele, which is associated with lower NET expression (and potentially higher synaptic NE level) would support attention processes among ADHD patients (similarly as atomoxetine increases NE levels), whereas it would hinder cortical functions in healthy children.",Functional and Structural Changes of the Blood-Nerve-Barrier in Diabetic Neuropathy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30692907,Frontiers in neuroscience,2019 02 01,"The incidence of diabetes mellitus is approaching global epidemic proportions and should be considered a major health-care problem of modern societies in the twenty-first century. Diabetic neuropathy is a common chronic complication of diabetes and, although an adequate glycemic control can reduce the frequency of diabetic neuropathy in type 1 diabetes, the majority of type 2 diabetic patients will develop this complication. The underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms are still poorly understood, preventing the development of effective treatment strategies. However, accumulating evidence suggests that breakdown of the blood-nerve barrier (BNB) plays a pivotal pathophysiological role in diabetic neuropathy. In the present review, we highlight the structural and functional significance of the BNB in health and disease, focusing on the pathological molecular events leading to BNB dysfunction in diabetic neuropathy. In addition, we discuss potential molecular targets involved in BNB homeostasis that may pave the way toward novel therapeutic strategies for treating diabetic neuropathy."

This paper provides empirical insights into theoretical debates by documenting participants' perspectives on an Ebola vaccine trial in West Africa. This trial provided hundreds of Africans with regular payments, food packages and certificates for participation. The researchers conducting the trials considered these socioeconomic provisions to be gifts in accordance with contemporary ethical standards and principles. Trial participants viewed them differently, however, approaching trial participation as a means for training and employment in what was from their perspective a new job market: the post-Ebola expansion of research and health care systems. This paper analyses participation in contemporary research by viewing the context-specific histories of trial participants through the lens of prior interventions, specifically participatory reintegration programmes conducted in Anglophone West Africa to overcome civil war crises. In particular, we argue that participation in the Ebola vaccine trial was inadvertently shaped by the design and outcomes of past reintegration programmes. Our results highlight the need to investigate existing socioeconomic landscapes which surround and indeed permeate clinical research as a prerequisite for understanding the participatory motives of vulnerable participants in West Africa and elsewhere.",Risk Factors Associated with Neonatal Sepsis: A Case Study at a Specialist Hospital in Ghana.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30692878,TheScientificWorldJournal,2019 02 15,"Worldwide, neonatal sepsis accounts for an estimated 26% of under-five deaths, with sub-Saharan Africa having the highest mortality rates. Though worldwide neonatal deaths have decreased by over 3.6 million per year since 2000, neonatal sepsis remains a notable hindrance to the progress in the decline of cause-specific mortality rates especially in sub-Saharan Africa. This study aimed at examining the risk factors of neonatal sepsis at the Trauma and Specialist Hospital, Winneba. The study was an unmatched case control retrospective study. Cases were neonates who had sepsis with their index mothers and controls were neonates who did not have sepsis with their index mothers. Neonatal and maternal medical records were retrieved from January to December 2017. Data abstraction lasted for one month and 2650 folders for the neonates and their index mothers were retrieved. Nine hundred (900) neonatal folders were considered valid for the study and likewise for the maternal folders. One hundred and three (103) folders were considered cases while 797 were considered as controls. Data were entered using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences Version 22. Logistic regression was used to determine the risk of neonatal sepsis. Maternal factors that predicted the occurrence of sepsis among neonates were parity (p<0.027), mode of delivery (p<0.001), bleeding disorder (p<0.001), and PROM (p<0.001). Neonatal risk factors which predicted the occurrence of sepsis were APGAR score in the first and fifth minute (p<0.001), resuscitation at birth (p<0.004), duration of stay in the facility (p<0.001), and neonatal age on admission (p<0.001). The study found both maternal and neonatal factors to have a strong association with the risk of developing neonatal sepsis. Encouraging maternal antenatal care utilization would help identify the risk factors during prenatal and postnatal care and appropriate interventions implemented to reduce the likelihood of the neonate developing sepsis.",Pattern of Disinfection of Root Canal Dentin by Alternated Acid-Base Irrigating Regimen.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30692877,TheScientificWorldJournal,2019 02 15,To quantify Enterococcus faecalis density in root canal dentin after chemomechanical preparation (CMP) using alternated irrigating regimen.,The Impact of Concave Coastline on Rainfall Offshore Distribution over Indonesian Maritime Continent.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30692876,TheScientificWorldJournal,2019 01 30,"Indonesian Maritime Continent has the second longest coastline in the world, but the characteristics of offshore rainfall and its relation to coastline type are not clearly understood. As a region with eighty percent being an ocean, knowledge of offshore rainfall is important to support activity over oceans. This study investigates the climatology of offshore rainfall based on TRMM 3B42 composite during 1998-2015 and its dynamical atmosphere which induces high rainfall intensity using WRF-ARW. The result shows that concave coastline drives the increasing rainfall over ocean with Cenderawasih Bay (widest concave coastline) having the highest rainfall offshore intensity (16.5 mm per day) over Indonesian Maritime Continent. Monthly peak offshore rainfall over concave coastline is related to direction of concave coastline and peak of diurnal cycle influenced by the shifting of low level convergence. Concave coastline facing the north has peak during northwesterly monsoonal flow (March), while concave coastline facing the east has peak during easterly monsoonal flow (July). Low level convergence zone shifts from inland during daytime to ocean during nighttime. Due to shape of concave coastline, land breeze strengthens low level convergence and supports merging rainfall over ocean during nighttime. Rainfall propagating from the area around inland to ocean is approximately 5.4 m/s over Cenderawasih Bay and 4.1 m/s over Tolo Bay. Merger rainfall and low level convergence are playing role in increasing offshore rainfall over concave coastline.","Corrigendum to ""Total Intravenous Anaesthesia with High-Dose Remifentanil Does Not Aggravate Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting and Pain, Compared with Low-Dose Remifentanil: A Double-Blind and Randomized Trial"".",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30692875,TheScientificWorldJournal,2019 02 15,[This corrects the article DOI: 10.1155/2014/724753.].,RASGRP2 Suppresses Apoptosis via Inhibition of ROS Production in Vascular Endothelial Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30692874,TheScientificWorldJournal,2019 02 15,"We have identified ras guanyl releasing protein 2 (rasgrp2) as a blood vessel related gene from Xenopus embryo. In addition, we reported that RASGRP2 is also expressed in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). It is known that RASGRP2 activates Ras-related protein 1 (Rap1). However, the function of RASGRP2 in human vascular endothelium remains unknown. Therefore, we performed functional analysis of RASGRP2 using immortalized HUVEC (TERT HUVEC). We established a stable RASGRP2 overexpressing cell line (TERT HUVEC R) and mock cell line (mock). Furthermore, we compared the activity of Rap1 and the generation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), which is related to cell death, in both cell lines. Significant increase in Rap1 activity was observed in the TERT HUVEC R compared to the mock. Furthermore, apoptosis by tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) stimulation was significantly more reduced in the TERT HUVEC R than in the mock. In the mock, apoptosis induced by TNF-α stimulation was decreased by pretreatment with diphenyleneiodonium (DPI), which is an inhibitor of NADPH oxidase (NOX). However, in the TERT HUVEC R, apoptosis induced by TNF-α stimulation was not reduced after pretreatment of DPI. Furthermore, there was no reduction in ROS production in the TERT HUVEC R after DPI pretreatment. In addition, the difference in the degree of apoptosis induced by TNF-α stimulation in both cell lines was consistent with the difference in ROS production in the cell lines. From these results, it was suggested that RASGRP2 activates Rap1 and the activated Rap1 suppresses apoptosis via NOX inhibition."

It has been in use since 1983 without much change, which is one of its most significant advantages. It includes all functional systems (although with some shortcomings) that may be affected in MS and reflects the clinical status as a number, which is quite valuable. Although there may be differences between EDSS practitioners, it has been in use for more than 30 years and it can objectively display the difference between a patient's clinical picture 20 years ago and today, which can be said for only a small number of scales.

The purpose of this paper is to illustrate the novel way in which cupping was utilized in conjunction with neural glides to better diagnose and manage a patient who presented with symptoms of peripheral neuropathic plantar foot pain. Case description: A 65-year-old male presented to physical therapy with the diagnosis of plantar fasciitis by an orthopedic surgeon. The presentation included a diffuse area of pain toward the medial border of the foot with a peripheral neuropathic pain description. Cupping was used to identify pain in the saphenous nerve distribution and aided in resolving symptoms with the concomitant use of lower quarter neural glides. Outcome: At discharge and 1-year follow-up, the patient had a full resolution of symptoms and a return to prior level of function. Self-report outcomes included the numeric pain rating scale and the lower extremity functional scale. Discussion: This case is the first to describe the use of cupping combined with neural glides in the diagnosis and management of peripheral neuropathic pain from the saphenous nerve that was previously diagnosed as plantar fasciitis. The proposed mechanisms behind this treatment are also reviewed. Conclusion: In patients that present with symptoms of plantar fasciitis, testing neural glides combined with cupping may be warranted to confirm or refute the presence of a peripheral neuropathic pain source.

The purpose of this study was to examine the side-bend rotation test (SBRT), which utilizes osseous locking, compared to the FRT. Methods: Thirty-eight healthy individuals (25 female, 26.03 years) were assessed for GJH via the Beighton Hypermobility Index (BHI). A blinded examiner performed the FRT and SBRT bilaterally, measuring ROM using a digital goniometer device. Results: Statistically significant differences in ROM were present for the FRT based on negative (0-3) and positive (4-9) BHI score: (Right 46.4±3.6, 49.6±4.8, p=.031), (Left 45.5±3.5, 49.0±5.2, p=.023); no differences were observed for the SBRT (Right 37.6±4.3, 38.9±3.4), (Left 37.7±4.2, 37.6±3.4).  When further stratifying the groups, a one-way ANOVA and post-hoc testing revealed significant differences of FRT range of motion between the BHI 7-9 group(52.4 ± 4.4 -53.9 ± 3.4) compared to BHI 0-3 (45.4 ± 3.6-46.2 ± 3.5) and 4-6 groups (46.0 ± 3.7-46.4 ± 2.2), p < .001; there were no significant differences between the 0-3 and 4-6 groups. There were no between group differences for the SBRT, BHI 0-3 (37.5 ± 4.4-37.7 ± 4.3), BHI 7-9 (39.9 ± 3.7-39.2 ± 3.5). Discussion: Individuals with GJH demonstrated significant differences in ROM for the FRT, but not the SBRT. The SBRT may be a useful alternative to the FRT for individuals with hyperlaxity. However, further research needs to be conducted to assess the diagnostic ability of this test in individuals with cervical pathology.",Instrument-assisted soft tissue mobilization and proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation techniques improve hamstring flexibility better than static stretching alone: a randomized clinical trial.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30692839,The Journal of manual & manipulative therapy,2019 02 01,"Objectives: Tight hamstrings contribute to inefficiency of movement and increased risk for injury. Static stretching is the most common intervention for this problem, but the use of alternatives like instrument-assisted soft tissue mobilization (IASTM) and proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) is increasing among clinicians. This study examined two prospective studies with the common aim of demonstrating the effectiveness of IASTM or PNF over static stretching for improving hamstring tightness. Methods: Nondisabled adults were recruited on a university campus. IASTM study: N = 17 (11 males and 6 females). PNF study: N = 23 (7 males and 16 females). Hip flexion range of motion was measured with a passive straight leg raise (for IASTM) or active straight leg raise (for PNF) before and after stretching. Participants performed a self-static stretch on one leg and received the alternative intervention on the contralateral leg. The two studies were analyzed separately for reliability indices and significant differences between interventions. Results: Hip flexion measures showed good reliability in both studies (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.97) with a minimal detectable change of <4.26. Both studies showed significant interactions between time and intervention (p < 0.05). Follow-up analyses revealed PNF and IASTM interventions resulted in greater increases in hip flexion range than static stretching. Discussion: These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of PNF and IASTM techniques over static stretching for hamstring flexibility. These interventions provide more efficient alternatives for improving flexibility in the clinic, allowing greater progress in a shorter period of time than an equivalent static stretching program.

A systematic review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30692838,The Journal of manual & manipulative therapy,2019 02 01,"Objectives: The purpose of this systematic review was to determine if movement-based classification (MBC) systems are more effective than therapeutic exercise or guideline-based care (GBC) in improving outcomes in patients with low back pain (LBP) based upon randomized clinical trials (RCT) with moderate to high methodological quality and low to moderate risk of bias. Methods: The search strategy was developed by a librarian experienced in systematic review methodology and peer reviewed by a second research librarian. The following databases were searched from their inception to May 17, 2018: PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. The identified RCTs with a PEDro score of ≥6 were screened and assessed for risk of bias by two blinded individual reviewers using Covidence. Results: Seven studies were identified that had moderate-to-high methodological quality. One of the studies was identified as having a high risk of bias. Of the six studies that remained, only one study reported finding a statistically significant difference at the immediate follow-up that was not clinically significant. There was no significance at 6 and 12 months. Discussion: There is a paucity of moderate to high methodological quality RCTs with similar methodology that compare MBC to standard of care treatments for patients with LBP. Studies with moderate to high methodological quality that have a low risk of bias do not support MBCs as being superior to general exercise or GBC in the treatment of nonradicular LBP.

We found in ApoE-deficient mice that oxidized lipids activated the classical complement cascade (CCC), resulting in leukocyte infiltration of the choroid plexus (ChP). All human ApoE isoforms attenuated CCC activity via high-affinity binding to the activated CCC-initiating C1q protein (KD~140-580 pM) in vitro, and C1q-ApoE complexes emerged as markers for ongoing complement activity of diseased ChPs, Aβ plaques, and atherosclerosis in vivo. C1q-ApoE complexes in human ChPs, Aβ plaques, and arteries correlated with cognitive decline and atherosclerosis, respectively. Treatment with small interfering RNA (siRNA) against C5, which is formed by all complement pathways, attenuated murine ChP inflammation, Aβ-associated microglia accumulation, and atherosclerosis. Thus, ApoE is a direct checkpoint inhibitor of unresolvable inflammation, and reducing C5 attenuates disease burden."

We discovered nanomolar, selective allosteric inhibitors of MALT1 that bind by displacing the side chain of Trp580, locking the protease in an inactive conformation. Interestingly, we had previously identified a patient homozygous for a MALT1 Trp580-to-serine mutation who suffered from combined immunodeficiency. We show that the loss of tryptophan weakened interactions between the paracaspase and C-terminal immunoglobulin MALT1 domains resulting in protein instability, reduced protein levels and functions. Upon binding of allosteric inhibitors of increasing potency, we found proportionate increased stabilization of MALT1-W580S to reach that of wild-type MALT1. With restored levels of stable MALT1 protein, the most potent of the allosteric inhibitors rescued NF-κB and JNK signaling in patient lymphocytes.

These preferences can be overcome provided some metals are more available than others. However, while the total amount of cellular metal can be readily measured, the available levels of each metal have been more difficult to define. Metal-sensing transcriptional regulators are tuned to the intracellular availabilities of their cognate ions. Here we have determined the standard free energy for metal complex formation to which each sensor, in a set of bacterial metal sensors, is attuned: the less competitive the metal, the less favorable the free energy and hence the greater availability to which the cognate allosteric mechanism is tuned. Comparing these free energies with values derived from the metal affinities of a metalloprotein reveals the mechanism of correct metalation exemplified here by a cobalt chelatase for vitamin B12.",Genetic and phenotypic landscape of the major histocompatibilty complex region in the Japanese population.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30692682,Nature genetics,2019 05 18,"To perform detailed fine-mapping of the major-histocompatibility-complex region, we conducted next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based typing of the 33 human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes in 1,120 individuals of Japanese ancestry, providing a high-resolution allele catalog and linkage-disequilibrium structure of both classical and nonclassical HLA genes. Together with population-specific deep-whole-genome-sequencing data (n = 1,276), we conducted NGS-based HLA, single-nucleotide-variant and indel imputation of large-scale genome-wide-association-study data from 166,190 Japanese individuals. A phenome-wide association study assessing 106 clinical phenotypes identified abundant, significant genotype-phenotype associations across 52 phenotypes. Fine-mapping highlighted multiple association patterns conferring independent risks from classical HLA genes. Region-wide heritability estimates and genetic-correlation network analysis elucidated the polygenic architecture shared across the phenotypes.","EZH2 oncogenic mutations drive epigenetic, transcriptional, and structural changes within chromatin domains.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30692681,Nature genetics,2019 05 18,"Chromatin is organized into topologically associating domains (TADs) enriched in distinct histone marks. In cancer, gain-of-function mutations in the gene encoding the enhancer of zeste homolog 2 protein (EZH2) lead to a genome-wide increase in histone-3 Lys27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) associated with transcriptional repression. However, the effects of these epigenetic changes on the structure and function of chromatin domains have not been explored. Here, we found a functional interplay between TADs and epigenetic and transcriptional changes mediated by mutated EZH2. Altered EZH2 (p.Tyr646* (EZH2Y646X)) led to silencing of entire domains, synergistically inactivating multiple tumor suppressors. Intra-TAD gene silencing was coupled with changes of interactions between gene promoter regions. Notably, gene expression and chromatin interactions were restored by pharmacological inhibition of EZH2Y646X. Our results indicate that EZH2Y646X alters the topology and function of chromatin domains to promote synergistic oncogenic programs.",GARFIELD classifies disease-relevant genomic features through integration of functional annotations with association signals.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30692680,Nature genetics,2019 04 24,"Loci discovered by genome-wide association studies predominantly map outside protein-coding genes. The interpretation of the functional consequences of non-coding variants can be greatly enhanced by catalogs of regulatory genomic regions in cell lines and primary tissues. However, robust and readily applicable methods are still lacking by which to systematically evaluate the contribution of these regions to genetic variation implicated in diseases or quantitative traits. Here we propose a novel approach that leverages genome-wide association studies' findings with regulatory or functional annotations to classify features relevant to a phenotype of interest. Within our framework, we account for major sources of confounding not offered by current methods. We further assess enrichment of genome-wide association studies for 19 traits within Encyclopedia of DNA Elements- and Roadmap-derived regulatory regions. We characterize unique enrichment patterns for traits and annotations driving novel biological insights.

By partially replacing the traditional lignin monomers by alternative ones, lignin extractability can be enhanced. To design a lignin that is easier to degrade under alkaline conditions, curcumin (diferuloylmethane) was produced in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana via simultaneous expression of the turmeric (Curcuma longa) genes DIKETIDE-CoA SYNTHASE (DCS) and CURCUMIN SYNTHASE 2 (CURS2). The transgenic plants produced a plethora of curcumin- and phenylpentanoid-derived compounds with no negative impact on growth. Catalytic hydrogenolysis gave evidence that both curcumin and phenylpentanoids were incorporated into the lignifying cell wall, thereby significantly increasing saccharification efficiency after alkaline pretreatment of the transgenic lines by 14-24% as compared with the wild type. These results demonstrate that non-native monomers can be synthesized and incorporated into the lignin polymer in plants to enhance their biomass processing efficiency.",Genome structure and evolution of Antirrhinum majus L.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30692677,Nature plants,2019 05 10,"Snapdragon (Antirrhinum majus L.), a member of the Plantaginaceae family, is an important model for plant genetics and molecular studies on plant growth and development, transposon biology and self-incompatibility.

Scaffolds covering 97.12% of the assembled genome were anchored on eight chromosomes. Comparative and evolutionary analyses revealed that a whole-genome duplication event occurred in the Plantaginaceae around 46-49 million years ago (Ma). We also uncovered the genetic architectures associated with complex traits such as flower asymmetry and self-incompatibility, identifying a unique duplication of TCP family genes dated to around 46-49 Ma and reconstructing a near-complete ψS-locus of roughly 2 Mb. The genome sequence obtained in this study not only provides a representative genome sequenced from the Plantaginaceae but also brings the popular plant model system of Antirrhinum into the genomic age.",Nanoparticles promote in vivo breast cancer cell intravasation and extravasation by inducing endothelial leakiness.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30692675,Nature nanotechnology,2019 05 17,"While most cancer nanomedicine is designed to eliminate cancer, the nanomaterial per se can lead to the formation of micrometre-sized gaps in the blood vessel endothelial walls. Nanomaterials-induced endothelial leakiness (NanoEL) might favour intravasation of surviving cancer cells into the surrounding vasculature and subsequently extravasation, accelerating metastasis. Here, we show that nanoparticles induce endothelial leakiness through disruption of the VE-cadherin-VE-cadherin homophilic interactions at the adherens junction. We show that intravenously injected titanium dioxide, silica and gold nanoparticles significantly accelerate both intravasation and extravasation of breast cancer cells in animal models, increasing the extent of existing metastasis and promoting the appearance of new metastatic sites. Our results add to the understanding of the behaviour of nanoparticles in complex biological systems. The potential for NanoEL needs to be taken into consideration when designing future nanomedicines, especially nanomedicine to treat cancer.",Self-assembled peptide-poloxamine nanoparticles enable in vitro and in vivo genome restoration for cystic fibrosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30692673,Nature nanotechnology,2019 05 17,"Developing safe and efficient non-viral delivery systems remains a major challenge for in vivo applications of gene therapy, especially in cystic fibrosis. Unlike conventional cationic polymers or lipids, the emerging poloxamine-based copolymers display promising in vivo gene delivery capabilities. However, poloxamines are invalid for in vitro applications and their in vivo transfection efficiency is still low compared with viral vectors. Here, we show that peptides developed by modular design approaches can spontaneously form compact and monodisperse nanoparticles with poloxamines and nucleic acids via self-assembly. Both messenger RNA and plasmid DNA expression mediated by peptide-poloxamine nanoparticles are greatly boosted in vitro and in the lungs of cystic fibrosis mice with negligible toxicity. Peptide-poloxamine nanoparticles containing integrating vectors enable successful in vitro and in vivo long-term restoration of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator deficiency with a safe integration profile.

Despite their importance, much remains to be learned about phages in the human microbiome. We investigated the gut microbiomes of humans from Bangladesh and Tanzania, two African baboon social groups and Danish pigs; many of these microbiomes contain phages belonging to a clade with genomes >540 kilobases in length, the largest yet reported in the human microbiome and close to the maximum size ever reported for phages. We refer to these as Lak phages. CRISPR spacer targeting indicates that Lak phages infect bacteria of the genus Prevotella. We manually curated to completion 15 distinct Lak phage genomes recovered from metagenomes. The genomes display several interesting features, including use of an alternative genetic code, large intergenic regions that are highly expressed and up to 35 putative transfer RNAs, some of which contain enigmatic introns. Different individuals have distinct phage genotypes, and shifts in variant frequencies over consecutive sampling days reflect changes in the relative abundance of phage subpopulations. Recent homologous recombination has resulted in extensive genome admixture of nine baboon Lak phage populations. We infer that Lak phages are widespread in gut communities that contain the Prevotella species, and conclude that megaphages, with fascinating and underexplored biology, may be common but largely overlooked components of human and animal gut microbiomes."

Their atomic thickness and large-scale synthesis capability could enable the development of 'smart skin'1,3-5, which could transform ordinary objects into an intelligent distributed sensor network6. However, although many important components of such a distributed electronic system have already been demonstrated (for example, transistors, sensors and memory devices based on two-dimensional materials1,2,4,7), an efficient, flexible and always-on energy-harvesting solution, which is indispensable for self-powered systems, is still missing. Electromagnetic radiation from Wi-Fi systems operating at 2.4 and 5.9 gigahertz8 is becoming increasingly ubiquitous and would be ideal to harvest for powering future distributed electronics. However, the high frequencies used for Wi-Fi communications have remained elusive to radiofrequency harvesters (that is, rectennas) made of flexible semiconductors owing to their limited transport properties9-12. Here we demonstrate an atomically thin and flexible rectenna based on a MoS2 semiconducting-metallic-phase heterojunction with a cutoff frequency of 10 gigahertz, which represents an improvement in speed of roughly one order of magnitude compared with current state-of-the-art flexible rectifiers9-12. This flexible MoS2-based rectifier operates up to the X-band8 (8 to 12 gigahertz) and covers most of the unlicensed industrial, scientific and medical radio band, including the Wi-Fi channels. By integrating the ultrafast MoS2 rectifier with a flexible Wi-Fi-band antenna, we fabricate a fully flexible and integrated rectenna that achieves wireless energy harvesting of electromagnetic radiation in the Wi-Fi band with zero external bias (battery-free). Moreover, our MoS2 rectifier acts as a flexible mixer, realizing frequency conversion beyond 10 gigahertz. This work provides a universal energy-harvesting building block that can be integrated with various flexible electronic systems.",Molecular parameters responsible for thermally activated transport in doped organic semiconductors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30692647,Nature materials,2019 05 08,"Doped organic semiconductors typically exhibit a thermal activation of their electrical conductivity, whose physical origin is still under scientific debate. In this study, we disclose relationships between molecular parameters and the thermal activation energy (EA) of the conductivity, revealing that charge transport is controlled by the properties of host-dopant integer charge transfer complexes (ICTCs) in efficiently doped organic semiconductors. At low doping concentrations, charge transport is limited by the Coulomb binding energy of ICTCs, which can be minimized by systematic modification of the charge distribution on the individual ions. The investigation of a wide variety of material systems reveals that static energetic disorder induced by ICTC dipole moments sets a general lower limit for EA at large doping concentrations. The impact of disorder can be reduced by adjusting the ICTC density and the intramolecular relaxation energy of host ions, allowing an increase of conductivity by many orders of magnitude.",Co-translational assembly of proteasome subunits in NOT1-containing assemblysomes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30692646,Nature structural & molecular biology,2019 02 06,"The assembly of large multimeric complexes in the crowded cytoplasm is challenging. Here we reveal a mechanism that ensures accurate production of the yeast proteasome, involving ribosome pausing and co-translational assembly of Rpt1 and Rpt2. Interaction of nascent Rpt1 and Rpt2 then lifts ribosome pausing. We show that the N-terminal disordered domain of Rpt1 is required to ensure efficient ribosome pausing and association of nascent Rpt1 protein complexes into heavy particles, wherein the nascent protein complexes escape ribosome quality control. Immunofluorescence and in situ hybridization studies indicate that Rpt1- and Rpt2-encoding messenger RNAs co-localize in these particles that contain, and are dependent on, Not1, the scaffold of the Ccr4-Not complex. We refer to these particles as Not1-containing assemblysomes, as they are smaller than and distinct from other RNA granules such as stress granules and GW- or P-bodies.

It is activated in response to DNA damage and this activation leads to proliferation arrest and cell death. The abundance and activity of p53 are tightly controlled and reductions in p53's activity can contribute to the development of cancer. Here, we show that Fam83F increases p53 protein levels by protein stabilisation. Fam83F interacts with p53 and decreases its ubiquitination and degradation. Fam83F is induced in response to DNA damage and its overexpression also increases p53 activity in cell culture experiments and in zebrafish embryos. Downregulation of Fam83F decreases transcription of p53 target genes in response to DNA damage and increases cell proliferation, identifying Fam83F as an important regulator of the DNA damage response. Overexpression of Fam83F also enhances migration of cells harbouring mutant p53 demonstrating that it can also activate mutant forms of p53.",Autophagy in endothelial cells and tumor angiogenesis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30692642,Cell death and differentiation,2019 03 29,"In mammalian cells, autophagy is the major pathway for the degradation and recycling of obsolete and potentially noxious cytoplasmic materials, including proteins, lipids, and whole organelles, through the lysosomes. Autophagy maintains cellular and tissue homeostasis and provides a mechanism to adapt to extracellular cues and metabolic stressors. Emerging evidence unravels a critical function of autophagy in endothelial cells (ECs), the major components of the blood vasculature, which delivers nutrients and oxygen to the parenchymal tissue. EC-intrinsic autophagy modulates the response of ECs to various metabolic stressors and has a fundamental role in redox homeostasis and EC plasticity. In recent years moreover, genetic evidence suggests that autophagy regulates pathological angiogenesis, a hallmark of solid tumors. In the hypoxic, nutrient-deprived, and pro-angiogenic tumor microenvironment, heightened autophagy in the blood vessels is emerging as a critical mechanism enabling ECs to dynamically accommodate their higher bioenergetics demands to the extracellular environment and connect with other components of the tumor stroma through paracrine signaling. In this review, we provide an overview of the major cellular mechanisms regulated by autophagy in ECs and discuss their potential role in tumor angiogenesis, tumor growth, and response to anticancer therapy.",Inhibition of EZH2 induces NK cell-mediated differentiation and death in muscle-invasive bladder cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30692641,Cell death and differentiation,2019 01 29,"Lysine-specific demethylase 6A (KDM6A) and members of the Switch/Sucrose Non-Fermentable (SWI/SNF) family are known to counteract the activity of Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 (EZH2), which is often overexpressed and is associated with poor prognosis in muscle-invasive bladder cancer. Here we provide evidence that alterations in chromatin modifying enzymes, including KDM6A and members of the SWI/SNF complex, are frequent in muscle-invasive bladder cancer. We exploit the loss of function mutations in KDM6A and SWI/SNF complex to make bladder cancer cells susceptible to EZH2-based epigenetic therapy that activates an immune response to drive tumor cell differentiation and death. We reveal a novel mechanism of action of EZH2 inhibition, alone and in combination with cisplatin, which induces immune signaling with the largest changes observed in interferon gamma (IFN-γ). This upregulation is a result of activated natural killer (NK) signaling as demonstrated by the increase in NK cell-associated genes MIP-1α, ICAM1, ICAM2, and CD86 in xenografts treated with EZH2 inhibitors. Conversely, EZH2 inhibition results in decreased expression of pluripotency markers, ALDH2 and CK5, and increased cell death. Our results reveal a novel sensitivity of muscle-invasive bladder cancer cells with KMD6A and SWI/SNF mutations to EZH2 inhibition alone and in combination with cisplatin. This sensitivity is mediated through increased NK cell-related signaling resulting in tumor cell differentiation and cell death.",Autophagy and cardiac aging.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30692640,Cell death and differentiation,2019 03 29,"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death and the prevalence of CVD dramatically increases with age. Cardiac aging is associated with hypertrophy, fibrosis, inflammation, and decreased contractility. Autophagy, a bulk degradation/recycling system, is essential to maintain cellular homeostasis. Cardiac autophagy is decreased with age, and misfolded proteins and dysfunctional mitochondria are accumulated in the aging heart. Inhibition of autophagy leads to exacerbated cardiac aging, while stimulation of autophagy improves cardiac function and also increases lifespan in many organisms. Thus autophagy represents a potential therapeutic target for aging-related cardiac dysfunction. This review discusses recent progress in our understanding of the role and regulation of autophagy in the aging heart.",THZ1 reveals CDK7-dependent transcriptional addictions in pancreatic cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30692639,Oncogene,2019 05 20,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a lethal malignancy with high mortality. Lack of effective treatment makes novel therapeutic discovery an urgent demand in PDAC research. By screening an epigenetic-related compound library, we identified THZ1, a covalent inhibitor of CDK7, as a promising candidate. Multiple long-established and patient-derived PDAC cell lines (PDC) were used to validate the efficacy of THZ1 in vitro. In addition, patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models and animal models of PDAC were utilized for examining THZ1 efficacy in vivo. Furthermore, RNA-Seq analyse was performed to reveal the molecular mechanism of THZ1 treatment. Finally, PDAC cell lines with primary or acquired resistance to THZ1 were investigated to explore the potential mechanism of THZ1 susceptibility. CDK7 inhibition was identified as a selective and potent therapeutic strategy for PDAC progression in multiple preclinical models. Mechanistic analyses revealed that CDK7 inhibition led to a pronounced downregulation of gene transcription, with a preferential repression of mitotic cell cycle and NF-κB signaling-related transcripts. MYC transcriptional was found to be involved in susceptibility of PDAC cells to CDK7 inhibition. In conclusion, Identification of CDK7-dependent transcriptional addiction in PDACs provides a potent therapeutic strategy that targets highly aggressive pancreatic cancer.",Lysosomal trapping of palbociclib and its functional implications.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30692638,Oncogene,2019 05 20,"Palbociclib is a selective inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4/6) approved for the treatment of some cancers. The main mechanism of action of palbociclib is to induce cell cycle arrest and senescence on responsive cells. Here, we report that palbociclib concentrates in intracellular acidic vesicles, where it can be readily observed due to its intrinsic fluorescence, and it is released from these vesicles upon dilution or washing out of the extracellular medium. This reversible storage of drugs into acidic vesicles is generally known as lysosomal trapping and, based on this, we uncover novel properties of palbociclib. In particular, a short exposure of cells to palbociclib is sufficient to produce a stable cell-cycle arrest and long-term senescence. Moreover, after washing out the drug, palbociclib-treated cells release the drug to the medium and this conditioned medium is active on susceptible cells. Interestingly, cancer cells resistant to palbociclib also accumulate and release the drug producing paracrine senescence on susceptible cells. Finally, other lysosomotropic drugs, such as chloroquine, interfere with the accumulation of palbociclib into lysosomes, thereby reducing the minimal dose of palbociclib required for cell-cycle arrest and senescence. In summary, lysosomal trapping explains the prolonged temporal activity of palbociclib, the paracrine activity of exposed cells, and the cooperation with lysosomotropic drugs. These are important features that may help to improve the therapeutic dosing and efficacy of palbociclib. Finally, two other clinically approved CDK4/6 inhibitors, ribociclib and abemaciclib, present a similar behavior as palbociclib, suggesting that lysosomal trapping is a property common to all three clinically-approved CDK4/6 inhibitors.",VPAC1 couples with TRPV4 channel to promote calcium-dependent gastric cancer progression via a novel autocrine mechanism.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30692637,Oncogene,2019 05 20,"Although VPAC1 and its ligand vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) are important in gastrointestinal physiology, their involvements in progression of gastrointestinal tumor have not been explored. Here, we found that higher expression of VIP/VPAC1 was observed in gastric cancer compared to the adjacent normal tissues. The increased expression of VIP/VPAC1 in gastric cancer correlated positively with invasion, tumor stage, lymph node, distant metastases, and poor survival. Moreover, high expression of VIP and VPAC1, advanced tumor stage and distant metastasis were independent prognostic factors. VPAC1 activation by VIP markedly induced TRPV4-mediated Ca2+ entry, and eventually promoted gastric cancer progression in a Ca2+ signaling-dependent manner. Inhibition of VPAC1 and its signaling pathway could block the progressive responses. VPAC1/TRPV4/Ca2+ signaling in turn enhanced the expression and secretion of VIP in gastric cancer cells, enforcing a positive feedback regulation mechanism. Taken together, our study demonstrate that VPAC1 is significantly overexpressed in gastric cancer and VPAC1/TRPV4/Ca2+ signaling axis could enforce a positive feedback regulation in gastric cancer progression. VIP/VPAC1 may serve as potential prognostic markers and therapeutic targets for gastric cancer."

However, precise checkpoints are required to prevent their unsolicited activation. Here we report that serpin family B member 1 (SERPINB1) limited the activity of those caspases by suppressing their caspase-recruitment domain (CARD) oligomerization and enzymatic activation. While the reactive center loop of SERPINB1 inhibits neutrophil serine proteases, its carboxy-terminal CARD-binding motif restrained the activation of pro-caspase-1/-4/-5/-11. Consequently, knockdown or deletion of SERPINB1 prompted spontaneous activation of caspase-1/-4/-5/-11, release of the cytokine IL-1β and pyroptosis, inducing elevated inflammation after non-hygienic co-housing with pet-store mice and enhanced sensitivity to lipopolysaccharide- or Acinetobacter baumannii-induced endotoxemia.

Pro-inflammatory TRM cells accumulated in the mucosa of patients with IBD, and the presence of CD4+CD69+CD103+ TRM cells was predictive of the development of flares. In vivo, functional impairment of TRM cells in mice with double knockout of the TRM-cell-associated transcription factors Hobit and Blimp-1 attenuated disease in several models of colitis, due to impaired cross-talk between the adaptive and innate immune system. Finally, depletion of TRM cells led to a suppression of colitis activity. Together, our data demonstrate a central role for TRM cells in the pathogenesis of chronic intestinal inflammation and suggest that these cells could be targets for future therapeutic approaches in IBD.",Probiotics for preterm infants: A National Retrospective Cohort Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30692619,Journal of perinatology : official journal of the California Perinatal Association,2019 03 26,"To evaluate the effect of prophylactic probiotic (PP) administration on rates of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), late-onset sepsis (LOS), and mortality in preterm infants.",Sutureless closure: a versatile treatment for the diverse presentations of gastroschisis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30692617,Journal of perinatology : official journal of the California Perinatal Association,2019 04 25,Case series have demonstrated sutureless closures to be safe for the correction of gastroschisis.

Recently, incompletely penetrant heterozygous mutations in ROBO1 have been described in patients with pituitary stalk interruption syndrome. Herein, we identified a novel homozygous slice site mutation in ROBO1 (c.1342+1G>A) using a trio whole-exome sequencing strategy in a 5-year-old Japanese boy who had combined pituitary hormone deficiency, psychomotor developmental delay, severe intellectual disability, sensorineural hearing loss, strabismus, and characteristic facial features, including a broad forehead, micrognathia, and arched eyebrows. Magnetic resonance imaging delineated anterior pituitary hypoplasia, ectopic posterior pituitary, invisible pituitary stalk, thinning of the corpus callosum, and hypoplasia of the pons and midbrain. The phenotypically normal parents (first cousins) were heterozygous for the mutation. The results provide further evidence of ROBO1 being involved in the development of the pituitary gland. A recessive mutation of ROBO1 is a potential novel cause of a syndromic disorder associated with combined pituitary hormone deficiency.",Is lenalidomide the standard-of-care after an autotransplant for plasma cell myeloma?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30692596,Leukemia,2019 05 20,"Three randomized controlled trials and a meta-analysis reported lenalidomide given after high-dose therapy and an autologous hemopoietic cell transplantation is associated with increase in progression-free survival (PFS) and survival in persons with plasma cell myeloma (PCM). Based on these data, posttransplant lenalidomide is considered by many a standard-of-care in this setting. However, decisions on the use of new therapies should consider not only results of such trials and meta-analyses but also other factors including quality-of-evidence, anticipated desired and undesired effects of the drug, costs and feasibility of the therapy option. In this review, we critically analyzed evidence on posttransplant lenalidomide in PCM, and we identified criteria which should be considered in designating posttransplant lenalidomide the standard-of-care. Using Grading of Evidence, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach we judged posttransplant lenalidomide improves PFS with high-quality evidence. However, we identified inconsistency and imprecision as limitations in the conclusions regarding a survival benefit rating the quality-of-evidence for a survival benefit moderate. We also highlighted inconsistency in claims of an increased risk of new cancers associated with posttransplant lenalidomide. We emphasize the need for a value-based reasoning which considers PFS and survival as well as health-related quality-of-life and costs. We conclude the decision to use posttransplant lenalidomide should be individualized based on pre- and posttransplant variables such as remission state, risk category and/or posttransplant measurable residual disease (MRD)-test results. Validity of these variables in estimating benefits and risks of posttransplant lenalidomide should be tested in randomized clinical trials.",Quantitative analysis of melanin content in a three-dimensional melanoma cell culture.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30692593,Scientific reports,2019 02 01,"Reliable measurement of the amount of melanin produced by melanocytes is essential to study various skin disorders and to evaluate the efficacy of candidate reagents for such disorders or for whitening purposes. Conventional melanin quantification methods are based on absorption spectroscopy, which measures the melanin from lysed cells grown on two-dimensional (2D) surfaces. The 2D culture environment is intrinsically different from in vivo systems though, and therefore cells often lose their original phenotypes. Melanocytes in particular lose their ability to synthesize melanin, thereby requiring melanogenesis stimulators such as alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone (α-MSH) to promote melanin synthesis. In this study, we compared melanin synthesis in B16 murine melanoma cells grown in 2D and three-dimensional culture environments. B16 cells instantly formed an aggregate in a hanging-drop culture, and synthesized melanin efficiently without treatment of α-MSH. We were able to measure the melanin secreted from a single melanocyte aggregate, indicating that our method enables non-invasive long-term monitoring of melanin synthesis and secretion in a high-throughput format. We successfully tested the developed platform by quantifying the depigmenting effects of arbutin and kojic acid.",Local electronic structure of doping defects on Tl/Si(111)1x1.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30692592,Scientific reports,2019 02 01,"The Tl/Si(111)1 × 1 surface is a representative of a 2D layer with Rashba-type spin-split electronic bands. To utilize the spin polarization, doping of the system should be understood on atomic level. We present a study of two types of atomic defects predicted to dope the considered electronic system - Si-induced vacancies and defects associated with the presence of extra Tl atoms. Structural calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) confirm the stability of the proposed defect structure consisting of an extra Si atom and missing seven Tl atoms as proposed in an earlier experimental study. The calculated spatial charge distributions indicate an enhancement of the charge around the extra Si atom, which correctly reproduces topographies of the corresponding scanning tunneling microscopy images while the calculated local densities of states of this system explain obtained scanning tunneling spectra. The DFT structural calculations let us determine the atomic structure of the defect caused by the presence of an extra Tl atom. The calculated spatial charge distributions show a ring-like feature around the extra Tl atom. The obtained results indicate a charge transfer from the central extra Tl atom to its vicinity in the agreement with earlier photoemission measurements.",Computer and internet use among people with long-standing spinal cord injury: a cross-sectional survey in the Netherlands.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30692591,Spinal cord,2019 05 07,"Cross-sectional survey OBJECTIVES: To describe computer and Internet use (other than for work or study) among people with long-standing spinal cord injury (SCI), examine associations between demographic and lesion characteristics and Internet use, and examine associations between Internet use and mental health, participation, and life satisfaction.",Both anti-inflammatory and antiviral properties of novel drug candidate ABX464 are mediated by modulation of RNA splicing.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30692590,Scientific reports,2019 02 01,"ABX464 is a first-in-class, clinical-stage, small molecule for oral administration that has shown strong anti-inflammatory effects in the DSS-model for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and also prevents replication of the HIV virus. ABX464 which binds to cap binding complex (CBC) has demonstrated safety and efficacy in a phase 2a proof-of-concept clinical trial in patients with Ulcerative colitis. Previously, with limited technologies, it was not possible to quantify the effect of ABX464 on viral and cellular RNA biogenesis. Here, using RNA CaptureSeq and deep sequencing, we report that ABX464 enhances the splicing of HIV RNA in infected PBMCs from six healthy individuals and also the expression and splicing of a single long noncoding RNA to generate the anti-inflammatory miR-124 both ex vivo and in HIV patients. While ABX464 has no effect on pre-mRNA splicing of cellular genes, depletion of CBC complex by RNAi leads to accumulation of intron retention transcripts. These results imply that ABX464 did not inhibit the function of CBC in splicing but rather strengthens it under pathological condition like inflammation and HIV infection. The specific dual ability of ABX464 to generate both anti-inflammatory miR-124 and spliced viral RNA may have applicability for the treatment of both inflammatory diseases and HIV infection.",Ambient Aqueous-Phase Synthesis of Copper Nanoparticles and Nanopastes with Low-Temperature Sintering and Ultra-High Bonding Abilities.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30692589,Scientific reports,2019 02 01,"Copper nanoparticles (NPs) with an average particle diameter of 50-60 nm were successfully obtained by reducing an aqueous solution of a copper(II)-nitrilotriacetic acid complex with an aqueous hydrazine solution at room temperature under an air atmosphere.

The electrical resistivity of the resulting copper electrode was 16 μΩ · cm. For a metal-to-metal bonding test, copper nanopaste was printed on an oxygen-free copper plate, another oxygen-free copper plate was placed on top, and the bonding strength between the copper plates when pressureless sintered under a nitrogen atmosphere at 200 °C for 30 min was 39 MPa. TEM observations confirmed that highly crystalline metal bonding occurred between the copper NPs and the copper plate to introduce the ultrahigh strength. The developed copper NPs could provide promising advances as nanopastes for sustainable fabrication of copper electrodes and die attachment materials for the production of next-generation power semiconductors.","Correlates of exposure to phenols, parabens, and triclocarban in the Study of Environment, Lifestyle and Fibroids.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30692588,Journal of exposure science & environmental epidemiology,2019 02 05,"We performed a cross-sectional analysis to identify correlates of urinary concentrations of seven phenols (bisphenols A, F, and S; 2,4-dichlorophenol; 2,5-dichlorophenol; benzophenone-3; triclosan), triclocarban, and four parabens (butyl, ethyl, methyl, and propyl). We analyzed baseline data from 766 participants in the Study of Environment, Lifestyle, and Fibroids, a prospective cohort study of 1693 Black women aged 23-34 years residing in Detroit, Michigan (2010-2012). We collected data on demographic, behavioral, and anthropometric factors via telephone interviews, clinic visits, and self-administered questionnaires. For each biomarker, we used linear regression models to estimate mean differences in log-transformed, creatinine-corrected concentrations across factors of interest. Each biomarker was detected in >50% of participants.

Adiponectin is a major anti-inflammatory mediator and so we hypothesized an effect of TRPC5 on the inflammatory condition of atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis was studied in aorta of ApoE-/- mice fed western-style diet. Inhibition of TRPC5 ion permeation was achieved by conditional transgenic expression of a dominant negative ion pore mutant of TRPC5 (DNT5). Gene expression analysis in adipose tissue suggested that DNT5 increases transcript expression for adiponectin while decreasing transcript expression of the inflammatory mediator Tnfα and potentially decreasing Il6, Il1β and Ccl2. Despite these differences there was mild or no reduction in plaque coverage in the aorta. Unexpectedly DNT5 caused highly significant reduction in body weight gain and reduced adipocyte size after 6 and 12 weeks of western-style diet. Steatosis and circulating lipids were unaffected but mild effects on regulators of lipogenesis could not be excluded, as indicated by small reductions in the expression of Srebp1c, Acaca, Scd1. The data suggest that TRPC5 ion channel permeation has little or no effect on atherosclerosis or steatosis but an unexpected major effect on weight gain."

Our approach implements the stabilized bi-conjugate gradient method (BiCG-STAB) for solving a sparse linear system to evolve the electronic wavefunction in time. The use of this established method makes the propagation scheme less restrictive compared to other schemes which may have particular requirements for the form of the equation, such as use of a three-point finite-difference approximation for spatial derivatives. Our method produces converged solutions significantly faster than existing methods, particularly if high accuracy is required. We demonstrate that this approach is suitable for a range of different parameters and show that in many circumstances significant gains can be made with the use of a fourth-order time propagator as opposed to the more common second-order Crank-Nicolson (CN) method.",Data-Driven Subtyping of Parkinson's Disease Using Longitudinal Clinical Records: A Cohort Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30692568,Scientific reports,2019 02 01,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is associated with diverse clinical manifestations including motor and non-motor signs and symptoms, and emerging biomarkers. We aimed to reveal the heterogeneity of PD to define subtypes and their progression rates using an automated deep learning algorithm on the top of longitudinal clinical records. This study utilizes the data collected from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI), which is a longitudinal cohort study of patients with newly diagnosed Parkinson's disease. Clinical information including motor and non-motor assessments, biospecimen examinations, and neuroimaging results were used for identification of PD subtypes. A deep learning algorithm, Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM), was used to represent each patient as a multi-dimensional time series for subtype identification. Both visualization and statistical analysis were performed for analyzing the obtained PD subtypes. As a result, 466 patients with idiopathic PD were investigated and three subtypes were identified. Subtype I (Mild Baseline, Moderate Motor Progression) is comprised of 43.1% of the participants, with average age 58.79 ± 9.53 years, and was characterized by moderate functional decay in motor ability but stable cognitive ability. Subtype II (Moderate Baseline, Mild Progression) is comprised of 22.9% of the participants, with average age 61.93 ± 6.56 years, and was characterized by mild functional decay in both motor and non-motor symptoms. Subtype III (Severe Baseline, Rapid Progression) is comprised 33.9% of the patients, with average age 65.32 ± 8.86 years, and was characterized by rapid progression of both motor and non-motor symptoms. These subtypes suggest that when comprehensive clinical and biomarker data are incorporated into a deep learning algorithm, the disease progression rates do not necessarily associate with baseline severities, and the progression rate of non-motor symptoms is not necessarily correlated with the progression rate of motor symptoms.",Fingerprint of silicic magma degassing visualised through chlorine microscopy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30692567,Scientific reports,2019 02 01,"Volatile-rich silicic magma erupts either explosively as a jet of a mixture of pyroclasts and high-temperature gas, or non-explosively to effuse lava. The bifurcation of the eruption style is widely recognised as being controlled by the efficiency of open-system gas loss from vesiculated magma during ascent. However, the fundamental question of how the gas escapes from highly viscous magma still remains unsolved because the pathways of gas flow are rarely preserved in dense lava. Here we show that such pathways are visualised in groundmass glass using high-resolution chlorine (Cl) mapping analysis on the rhyolitic lava of the Mukaiyama volcano, Japan. The results showed that the glass was highly heterogeneous in Cl content. A spatial distribution of the Cl content in the groundmass glass showed that volatiles diffused towards most bubbles, but the bubbles collapsed into the dense melt rather than growing. All observations, in combination with melt inclusion analysis, indicate that vesiculation, the formation of interconnected bubble channels, open-system gas loss via the channels, and channel collapse repeated within the period of a few days to two weeks during ascent. This cycle repeated individually in centimetre-sized portions of magma with different timing.",Parathyroid hormone and premature thymus ageing in patients with chronic kidney disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30692566,Scientific reports,2019 02 01,"Premature immune ageing, including thymic atrophy, is observed in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Parathyroid hormone (PTH) and fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), which are mineral and bone disorder (MBD)-related factors, affect immune cells and possibly cause thymic atrophy. We examined the cross-sectional association between thymic atrophy, evaluated as the number of CD3+CD4+CD45RA+CD31+ cells [recent thymic emigrants (RTE)/μL], and MBD-related factors [(serum PTH, FGF23, and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) level] in 125 patients with non-dialysis dependent CKD. Median estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was 17 mL/min/1.73 m2. Older age (r = -0.46), male sex (r = -0.34), lower eGFR (r = 0.27), lower serum-corrected calcium (r = 0.27), higher PTH (r = -0.36), and higher ALP level (r = -0.20) were identified as determinants of lower number of RTE. In contrast, serum concentrations of FGF23 and phosphorus were not correlated with RTE. Multivariate non-linear regression analysis indicated a negative association between serum PTH and log-transformed RTE (P = 0.030, P for non-linearity = 0.124). However, the serum levels of FGF23 and ALP were not associated with RTE.

Although substantial advances have been obtained both in treatment and survival rates, there is still a need for new therapeutical approaches. Natural compounds are a realistic source of new bioactive compounds with anticancer activity. Among them, rosemary polyphenols have shown a vast antiproliferative capacity against colon cancer cells in vitro and in animal models. We have investigated the antitumor activity of a rosemary extract (RE) obtained by using supercritical fluid extraction through its capacity to inhibit various signatures of cancer progression and metastasis such as proliferation, migration, invasion and clonogenic survival. RE strongly inhibited proliferation, migration and colony formation of colon cancer cells regardless their phenotype. Treatment with RE led to a sharp increase of intracellular ROS that resulted in necrosis cell death. Nrf2 gene silencing increased RE cytotoxic effects, thus suggesting that this pathway was involved in cell survival. These in vitro results were in line with a reduction of tumor growth by oral administration of RE in a xenograft model of colon cancer cells using athymic nude mice. These findings indicate that targeting colon cancer cells by increasing intracellular ROS and decreasing cell survival mechanisms may suppose a therapeutic option in colon cancer through the combination of rosemary compounds and chemotherapeutic drugs.",Discrete Structure of the Brain Rhythms.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30692564,Scientific reports,2019 02 01,"Neuronal activity in the brain generates synchronous oscillations of the Local Field Potential (LFP). The traditional analyses of the LFPs are based on decomposing the signal into simpler components, such as sinusoidal harmonics. However, a common drawback of such methods is that the decomposition primitives are usually presumed from the onset, which may bias our understanding of the signal's structure. Here, we introduce an alternative approach that allows an impartial, high resolution, hands-off decomposition of the brain waves into a small number of discrete, frequency-modulated oscillatory processes, which we call oscillons. In particular, we demonstrate that mouse hippocampal LFP contain a single oscillon that occupies the θ-frequency band and a couple of γ-oscillons that correspond, respectively, to slow and fast γ-waves. Since the oscillons were identified empirically, they may represent the actual, physical structure of synchronous oscillations in neuronal ensembles, whereas Fourier-defined ""brain waves"" are nothing but poorly resolved oscillons.",Effect of continuous and intermittent electric current on lignin wastewater treatment and microbial community structure in electro-microbial system.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30692563,Scientific reports,2019 02 01,"In this study, complex structured soluble lignin wastewater was treated by electro-microbial system (EMS) using different direct current (DC) application modes (CR (continuous ON), IR12h (12 h-ON/12 h-OFF) and IR2h (2 h-ON/2 h-OFF)), and physiological characteristics and microbial communities were investigated. Results showed that CR, IR12h and IR2h had higher lignin removals, which were almost two times that of the control reactor (R0', no current), and IR2h performed best and stably. Furthermore, IR2h exhibited the lowest ohmic resistance (Rs) of electrode biofilms, which could be explained by its higher abundance of electroactive bacteria. In the activated sludge of EMS, the concentration of dehydrogenase activity (DHA) and electronic transport system (ETS) in IR2h were the highest (1.48 and 1.28 times of R0'), which contributed to its high content of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The viability of activated sludge was not affected by different DC application modes. Phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA) analysis indicated that IR2h had the maximum content of C15:1 anteiso A, C16:0 and C18:0; CR increased the content of C15:0 anteiso and decreased the content of saturated fatty acids.

Thus, a supervised learning-based computational model has been proposed in this study, which is first of its kind for the prediction of seven classes of GETS. The cDNA sequences of the genes were initially transformed into numeric features based on the k-mer compositions and then supplied as input to the support vector machine. In the proposed SVM-based model, the prediction occurs in two stages, where a binary classifier in the first stage discriminates the genes involved in conferring the resistance to herbicides from other genes, followed by a multi-class classifier in the second stage that categorizes the predicted herbicide resistant genes in the first stage into any one of the seven resistant classes. Overall classification accuracies were observed to be ~89% and >97% for binary and multi-class classifications respectively. The proposed model confirmed higher accuracy than the homology-based algorithms viz., BLAST and Hidden Markov Model. Besides, the developed computational model achieved ~87% accuracy, while tested with an independent dataset. An online prediction server HRGPred ( http://cabgrid.res.in:8080/hrgpred ) has also been established to facilitate the prediction of GETS by the scientific community.",Overcoming NADPH product inhibition improves D-sorbitol conversion to L-sorbose.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30692560,Scientific reports,2019 02 01,"Gluconobacter oxydans sorbitol dehydrogenase (GoSLDH) exhibits a higher catalytic efficiency than other L-sorbose producing enzymes. During the reaction catalysed by GoSLDH, NADP+ is reduced to NADPH and D-sorbitol is oxidized to L-sorbose. However, GoSLDH activity is inhibited by the NADPH (Ki = 100 μM) formed during the enzymatic reaction. Therefore, Escherichia coligosldh-lrenox producing both GoSLDH for D-sorbitol oxidation and LreNOX (NAD(P)H oxidase from Lactobacillus reuteri) for NADP+ regeneration was generated and used for L-sorbose production. Whole cell biocatalysts with the LreNOX cofactor recycling system showed a high conversion rate (92%) of D-sorbitol to L-sorbose in the presence of low concentration of NADP+ (0.5 mM). By alleviating NADPH accumulation during the catalytic reactions, E. coligosldh-lrenox exhibited 23-fold higher conversion rate of D-sorbitol than E. coligosldh. L-Sorbose production by E. coligosldh-lrenox reached 4.1 g/L after 40 min, which was 20.5-fold higher than that of E. coligosldh. We also constructed G. oxydansgosldh and G. oxydansgosldh-lrenox strains, and they exhibited 1.2- and 2.9-fold higher conversion rates than the wild-type G. oxydans KCTC 1091. The results indicate that overcoming NADPH product inhibition using LreNOX improves chemical production in NADP+-dependent enzymatic reactions.","A Comparative Analysis of the Status Anxiety Hypothesis of Socio-economic Inequalities in Health Based on 18,349 individuals in Four Countries and Five Cohort Studies.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30692559,Scientific reports,2019 02 01,"The status anxiety hypothesis proposes that systematic inflammation as a consequence of chronic psycho-social stress is a possible pathway linking socio-economic position (SEP) to premature ageing and is a possible explanation for cross-national variation in patterns of health and well-being. Harmonised data from the LIFEPATH consortium on 18,349 individuals aged 50 to 75 and 30,632 observations are used to measure variation in the association between inflammation measured as C-reactive protein and SEP across four countries (Britain, Ireland, Portugal and Switzerland) and five studies (ELSA, Whitehall II, TILDA, EPIPorto and SKIPOGH). Adjusting for population composition, mean concentrations of CRP are highest in Portugal, the country with the highest income inequality and lowest in Switzerland, a lower income inequality country. Across all of the studies, lower SEP groups have higher mean concentrations of CRP and, as predicted by the theory, absolute differentials between SEP groups reflect the pattern of societal income inequality. Adjustment for lifestyle indicators reduces SEP differentials by between 45% and 52% but cannot account for country variation in mean inflammation."

Here we report scCAT-seq, a technique for simultaneously assaying chromatin accessibility and the transcriptome within the same single cell. We show that the combined single cell signatures enable accurate construction of regulatory relationships between cis-regulatory elements and the target genes at single-cell resolution, providing a new dimension of features that helps direct discovery of regulatory patterns specific to distinct cell identities. Moreover, we generate the first single cell integrated map of chromatin accessibility and transcriptome in early embryos and demonstrate the robustness of scCAT-seq in the precise dissection of master transcription factors in cells of distinct states. The ability to obtain these two layers of omics data will help provide more accurate definitions of ""single cell state"" and enable the deconvolution of regulatory heterogeneity from complex cell populations.",Venous identity requires BMP signalling through ALK3.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30692543,Nature communications,2019 03 29,"Venous endothelial cells are molecularly and functionally distinct from their arterial counterparts. Although veins are often considered the default endothelial state, genetic manipulations can modulate both acquisition and loss of venous fate, suggesting that venous identity is the result of active transcriptional regulation. However, little is known about this process. Here we show that BMP signalling controls venous identity via the ALK3/BMPR1A receptor and SMAD1/SMAD5. Perturbations to TGF-β and BMP signalling in mice and zebrafish result in aberrant vein formation and loss of expression of the venous-specific gene Ephb4, with no effect on arterial identity. Analysis of a venous endothelium-specific enhancer for Ephb4 shows enriched binding of SMAD1/5 and a requirement for SMAD binding motifs. Further, our results demonstrate that BMP/SMAD-mediated Ephb4 expression requires the venous-enriched BMP type I receptor ALK3/BMPR1A. Together, our analysis demonstrates a requirement for BMP signalling in the establishment of Ephb4 expression and the venous vasculature.",Author Correction: Hysteresis control of epithelial-mesenchymal transition dynamics conveys a distinct program with enhanced metastatic ability.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30692542,Nature communications,2019 02 01,"The original version of this Article contained an error in the spelling of the author Daniel D.

Here we show that nuclear LDs in hepatocytes are derived from apolipoprotein B (ApoB)-free lumenal LDs, a precursor to very low-density lipoproprotein (VLDL) generated in the ER lumen by microsomal triglyceride transfer protein. ApoB-free lumenal LDs accumulate under ER stress, grow within the lumen of the type I nucleoplasmic reticulum, and turn into nucleoplasmic LDs by disintegration of the surrounding inner nuclear membrane. Oleic acid with or without tunicamycin significantly increases the formation of nucleoplasmic LDs, to which CDP-choline diacylglycerol phosphotransferase α (CCTα) is recruited, resulting in activation of phosphatidylcholine (PC) synthesis. Perilipin-3 competes with CCTα in binding to nucleoplasmic LDs, and thus, knockdown and overexpression of perilipin-3 increases and decreases PC synthesis, respectively. The results indicate that nucleoplasmic LDs in hepatocytes constitute a feedback mechanism to regulate PC synthesis in accordance with ER stress.",Visible light-induced direct α C-H functionalization of alcohols.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30692540,Nature communications,2019 02 01,"Considering the synthetic value of introducing active alcoholic hydroxyl group, developing C-H functionalization of alcohols is of significance.

The N-F activation of selectfluor under blue LEDs irradiation is evidenced by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) study, which is the key process for the oxidative activation of α sp3 C-H alcohols. The observed reactivity may have significant implications for chemical transformations.",Forecasting dryland vegetation condition months in advance through satellite data assimilation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30692539,Nature communications,2019 02 01,"Dryland ecosystems are characterised by rainfall variability and strong vegetation response to changes in water availability over a range of timescales. Forecasting dryland vegetation condition can be of great value in planning agricultural decisions, drought relief, land management and fire preparedness. At monthly to seasonal time scales, knowledge of water stored in the system contributes more to predictability than knowledge of the climate system state. However, realising forecast skill requires knowledge of the vertical distribution of moisture below the surface and the capacity of the vegetation to access this moisture. Here, we demonstrate that contrasting satellite observations of water presence over different vertical domains can be assimilated into an eco-hydrological model and combined with vegetation observations to infer an apparent vegetation-accessible water storage (hereafter called accessible storage). Provided this variable is considered explicitly, skilful forecasts of vegetation condition are achievable several months in advance for most of the world's drylands.",A Rho-actin signaling pathway shapes cell wall boundaries in Arabidopsis xylem vessels.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30692538,Nature communications,2019 02 15,"Patterned cell wall deposition is crucial for cell shapes and functions. In Arabidopsis xylem vessels, ROP11 GTPase locally inhibits cell wall deposition through microtubule disassembly, inducing pits in cell walls. Here, we show that an additional ROP signaling pathway promotes cell wall growth at pit boundaries. Two proteins, Boundary of ROP domain1 (BDR1) and Wallin (WAL), localize to pit boundaries and regulate cell wall growth. WAL interacts with F-actin and promotes actin assembly at pit boundaries while BDR1 is a ROP effector. BDR1 interacts with WAL, suggesting that WAL could be recruited to the plasma membrane by a ROP-dependent mechanism. These results demonstrate that BDR1 and WAL mediate a ROP-actin pathway that shapes pit boundaries. The study reveals a distinct machinery in which two closely associated ROP pathways oppositely regulate cell wall deposition patterns for the establishment of tiny but highly specialized cell wall domains.",2600-years of stratospheric volcanism through sulfate isotopes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30692536,Nature communications,2019 06 13,"High quality records of stratospheric volcanic eruptions, required to model past climate variability, have been constructed by identifying synchronous (bipolar) volcanic sulfate horizons in Greenland and Antarctic ice cores. Here we present a new 2600-year chronology of stratospheric volcanic events using an independent approach that relies on isotopic signatures (Δ33S and in some cases Δ17O) of ice core sulfate from five closely-located ice cores from Dome C, Antarctica. The Dome C stratospheric reconstruction provides independent validation of prior reconstructions. The isotopic approach documents several high-latitude stratospheric events that are not bipolar, but climatically-relevant, and diverges deeper in the record revealing tropospheric signals for some previously assigned bipolar events. Our record also displays a collapse of the Δ17O anomaly of sulfate for the largest volcanic eruptions, showing a further change in atmospheric chemistry induced by large emissions. Thus, the refinement added by considering both isotopic and bipolar correlation methods provides additional levels of insight for climate-volcano connections and improves ice core volcanic reconstructions."

Although engineered domain swapping is a compelling strategy for protein assembly, its application has been limited due to the lack of simple and reliable design approaches. Here, we demonstrate that the hydrophobic five-residue 'cystatin motif' (QVVAG) from the domain-swapping protein Stefin B, when engineered into a solvent-exposed, tight surface loop between two β-strands prevents the loop from folding back upon itself, and drives domain swapping in non-domain-swapping proteins. High-resolution structural studies demonstrate that engineering the QVVAG stretch independently into various surface loops of four structurally distinct non-domain-swapping proteins enabled the design of different modes of domain swapping in these proteins, including single, double and open-ended domain swapping. These results suggest that the introduction of the QVVAG motif can be used as a mutational approach for engineering domain swapping in diverse β-hairpin proteins.",IFNβ enhances mesenchymal stromal (Stem) cells immunomodulatory function through STAT1-3 activation and mTOR-associated promotion of glucose metabolism.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30692524,Cell death & disease,2019 02 12,"Administration of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) ameliorate experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a mouse model of multiple sclerosis (MS), at both clinical and neuropathological levels. The therapeutic properties of MSC in EAE are mainly mediated by the modulation of pathogenic immune response, but other neurotropic effects, including decreased demyelination and axonal loss as well as promotion of tissue repair, play also a role. Properly controlled phase II clinical trials to explore the potential of MSC transplantation as a treatment for MS are underway. Interferon beta (IFNβ) is an approved treatment for relapsing-remitting and secondary progressive MS. Here, we explored the possibility that IFNβ might influence the therapeutic potential of MSC, in view of possible synergistic effects as add-on therapy. IFNβ enhanced the immunomodulatory functions of MSC and induced the expression of secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (Slpi) and hepatocyte growth factor (Hgf), two soluble mediators involved in immune and regenerative functions of MSC. At molecular level, IFNβ induced a rapid and transient phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3, the transcription factors responsible for Slpi and Hgf induction. Concomitantly, IFNβ dynamically affected the activity of mTOR, a key checkpoint in the control of metabolic pathways. Indeed, the impairment of mTOR activity observed early upon exposure to IFNβ, was followed by a long-lasting induction of mTOR signaling, that was associated with an increased glycolytic capacity in MSC. When induced to switch their energetic metabolism towards glycolysis, MSC showed an improved ability to control T-cell proliferation. These results suggest that modifications of MSC energetic metabolism induced by IFNβ may contribute to promote MSC immunomodulatory function and support a role for metabolic pathways in the therapeutic function of MSC. Altogether, these findings support the idea of a combined treatment for MS, in which the immunomodulatory and possibly regenerative activity of MSC could be enhanced by the administration of IFNβ.",Induction of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase mediates statin resistance in breast cancer cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30692522,Cell death & disease,2019 02 01,"The mevalonate pathway has emerged as a promising target for several solid tumors. Statins are inhibitors of the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCR), the rate-limiting enzyme of this pathway, and are commonly used to treat patients with hypercholesterolemia. Pleiotropic antitumor mechanisms of statins have been demonstrated for several human cancer types. However, cancer cells differ in their individual statin sensitivity and some cell lines have shown relative resistance. In this study we demonstrate, that the human breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468, MCF-7, and T47D are differentially affected by statins. Whereas the vitality of MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells was reduced by up to 60% using atorvastatin, simvastatin, or rosuvastatin (p < 0.001), only marginal effects were seen in T47D and MCF-7 cells following exposure to statins. Statin treatment led to an upregulation of HMGCR mRNA and protein expression by up to sixfolds in the statin-resistant cells lines (p < 0.001), but no alterations of HMGCR were observed in the statin-sensitive MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells. The knockdown of HMGCR prior to statin treatment sensitized the resistant cell lines, reflected by a 70% reduction in vitality, increased apoptotic DNA fragmentation (sixfold) and by accumulation of the apoptosis marker cleaved poly-ADP ribose polymerase. Statins induced a cleavage of the sterol-regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP)-2, a transcriptional activator of the HMGCR, in T47D and MCF-7 cells. The inhibition of SREBP-2 activation by co-administration of dipyridamole sensitized MCF-7 and T47D cells for statins (loss of vitality by 80%; p < 0.001). Furthermore, assessment of a statin-resistant MDA-MB-231 clone, generated by long-term sublethal statin exposure, revealed a significant induction of HMGCR expression by up to 12-folds (p < 0.001). Knockdown of HMGCR restored statin sensitivity back to levels of the parental cells. In conclusion, these results indicate a resistance of cancer cells against statins, which is in part due to the induction of HMGCR.",TRAIL inhibits RANK signaling and suppresses osteoclast activation via inhibiting lipid raft assembly and TRAF6 recruitment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30692521,Cell death & disease,2019 02 01,"Human osteoclast formation from mononuclear phagocyte precursors involves interactions between members of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) ligand superfamily and their receptors. Recent evidence indicated that TNF-α-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) induces osteoclast differentiation via a TRAF6-dependent signaling pathway; but paradoxically, it inhibits RANK ligand (RANKL)-induced osteoclast differentiation. Although a number of signaling pathways were linked to the RANK and osteoclastogenesis, it is not known how TRAIL regulates RANK signaling. In this study, we demonstrate that TRAIL regulates RANK-induced osteoclastogenesis in terms of the assembly of lipid raft-associated signaling complexes. RANKL stimulation induced recruitment of TRAF6, c-Src, and DAP-12 into lipid rafts. However, the RANKL-induced assembly of lipid raft-associated signaling complexes and TRAF6 recruitment was abolished in the presence of TRAIL. TRAIL-induced dissociation of RANKL-induced lipid raft signaling complexes was reversed by treatment with TRAIL receptor (TRAIL-R) siRNA or an anti-TRAIL-R blocking antibody, indicating that TRAIL mediates suppression of RANKL-induced lipid raft signaling via interactions with TRAIL-R. Finally, we demonstrated that TRAIL suppressed inflammation-induced bone resorption and osteoclastogenesis in a collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) rat animal model. Our results provide a novel apoptosis-independent role of TRAIL in regulating RANK signaling and suppresses osteoclast activation via inhibiting lipid raft assembly and TRAF6 recruitment.",Cancer cell-derived immunoglobulin G activates platelets by binding to platelet FcγRIIa.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30692520,Cell death & disease,2019 02 01,"Tumor-associated thrombosis is the second leading risk factor for cancer patient death, and platelets activity is abnormal in cancer patients. Discovering the mechanism of platelet activation and providing effective targets for therapy are urgently needed. Cancer cell- derived IgG has been reported to regulate development of tumors. However, studies on the functions of cancer cell-derived IgG are quite limited. Here we investigated the potential role of cancer cell-derived IgG in platelet activation. We detected the expression of CD62P on platelets by flow cytometry and analyzed platelet function by platelets aggregation and ATP release. The content of IgG in cancer cell supernatants was detected by enzyme-linked immune sorbent assay. The distribution of cancer-derived IgG in cancer cells was analyzed by immunofluorescence assay. Western blot was performed to quantify the relative expression of FcγRIIa, syk, PLCγ2. The interaction between cancer cell-derived IgG and platelet FcγRIIa was analyzed by co-immunoprecipitation. The results showed that higher levels of CD62P were observed in cancer patients' platelets compared with that of healthy volunteers. Cancer cell culture supernatants increased platelet CD62P and PAC-1 expression, sensitive platelet aggregation and ATP release in response to agonists, while blocking FcγRIIa or knocking down IgG reduced the activation of platelets. Coimmunoprecipitation results showed that cancer cell-derived IgG interacted directly with platelet FcγRIIa. In addition, platelet FcγRIIa was highly expressed in liver cancer patients. In summary, cancer cell-derived IgG interacted directly with FcγRIIa and activated platelets; targeting this interaction may be an approach to prevent and treat tumor-associated thrombosis.",ASF1a inhibition induces p53-dependent growth arrest and senescence of cancer cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30692519,Cell death & disease,2019 02 01,"Anti-silencing function 1a (ASF1a) is a histone H3-H4 chaperone isoform involved in chromatin assembling and transcription regulation. Recently, ASF1a has been shown to be up-regulated in certain human malignancies and required for the expression of telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT), a factor essential for the immortal phenotype of cancer cells; however, its role in oncogenesis remains poorly defined. In the present study, we determine whether ASF1a is required for the unlimited proliferation of cancer cells, a key cancer hallmark. Elevated ASF1a mRNA expression was observed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tumors. The overexpression of ASF1a was similarly found in 20 cancer types contained in TCGA and GTEx datasets. ASF1a knockdown led to growth arrest and senescence of wild-type (wt) p53-carrying HCC and prostate cancer cells. Cellular senescence mediated by ASF1a inhibition resulted from the robust up-regulation of p53 and p21cip1 expression, but without detectable changes in TERT expression. p53 inhibition attenuated p21cip1 induction caused by ASF1a depletion. Mechanistically, ASF1a-knocked down cells displayed widespread DNA damage. The TCGA dataset analysis revealed a negative correlation between ASF1a and p21cip1 expression in multiple types of primary tumors, including HCC, prostate, gastric, and breast cancer. Higher ASF1a and lower p21cip1 expression predicted a poor outcome in patients with HCC. Our results reveal that ASF1a overexpression is widespread in human malignancies and is required for the infinite proliferation of cancer cells, whereas its inhibition induces DNA damage and subsequent up-regulation of p53-p21cip1 expression, thereby triggering cellular senescence. Thus, ASF1a may serve as a potential target in cancer therapy.",High cholesterol triggers white matter alterations and cognitive deficits in a mouse model of cerebrovascular disease: benefits of simvastatin.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30692517,Cell death & disease,2019 02 01,"Transgenic mice overexpressing transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF mice) display impaired cerebrovascular reactivity, cerebral hypoperfusion and neurovascular uncoupling, but no overt cognitive deficits until old age. Cardiovascular diseases are a major risk factor for vascular cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID). We investigated the impact of a high cholesterol diet (HCD) on cerebrovascular and cognitive function in adult (6 months) and aged (12 months) TGF mice, together with the potential benefit of simvastatin (SV), an anti-cholesterol drug with pleiotropic effects, in adult mice. HCD increased blood, but not brain, cholesterol levels in treated mice, which SV did not reduce. In WT mice, HCD induced small, albeit significant, impairment in endothelium-dependent dilatory function. In TGF mice, HCD worsened the established brain vessel dilatory dysfunction in an age-dependent manner and increased the number of string vessels in the white matter (WM), alterations respectively normalized and significantly countered by SV. HCD triggered cognitive decline only in TGF mice at both ages, a deficit prevented by SV. Concurrently, HCD upregulated galectin-3 immunoreactivity in WM microglial cells, a response significantly reduced in SV-treated TGF mice. Grey matter astrogliosis and microgliosis were not affected by HCD or SV. In the subventricular zone of adult HCD-treated TGF mice, SV promoted oligogenesis and migration of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells. The results demonstrate that an underlying cerebrovascular pathology increases vulnerability to cognitive failure when combined to another risk factor for dementia, and that WM alterations are associated with this loss of function. The results further indicate that myelin repair mechanisms, as triggered by SV, may bear promise in preventing or delaying cognitive decline related to VCID.",Hypoxia-induced 26S proteasome dysfunction increases immunogenicity of mesenchymal stem cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30692516,Cell death & disease,2019 02 01,"Bone marrow-derived allogeneic (donor derived) mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are immunoprivileged and are considered to be prominent candidates for regenerative therapy for numerous degenerative diseases. Even though the outcome of initial allogeneic MSCs based clinical trials was encouraging, the overall enthusiasm, of late, has dimmed down. This is due to failure of long-term survival of transplanted cells in the recipient. In fact, recent analyses of allogeneic MSC-based studies demonstrated that cells after transplantation turned immunogenic and were subsequently rejected by host immune system. The current study reveals a novel mechanism of immune switch in MSCs. We demonstrate that hypoxia, a common denominator of ischemic tissues, induces an immune shift in MSCs from immunoprivileged to immunogenic state. The immunoprivilege of MSCs is preserved by downregulation or the absence of major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC-II) molecules. We found that 26S proteasome-mediated intracellular degradation of MHC-II helps maintain the absence of MHC-II expression on cell surface in normoxic MSCs and preserves their immunoprivilege. The exposure to hypoxia leads to dissociation of 19S and 20S subunits, and inactivation of 26S proteasome. This prevented the degradation of MHC-II and, as a result, the MSCs became immunogenic. Furthermore, we found that hypoxia-induced decrease in the levels of a chaperon protein HSP90α is responsible for inactivation of 26S proteasome. Maintaining HSP90α levels in hypoxic MSCs preserved the immunoprivilege of MSCs. Therefore, hypoxia-induced inactivation of 26S proteasome assembly instigates loss of immunoprivilege of allogeneic mesenchymal stem cells. Maintaining 26S proteasome activity in mesenchymal stem cells preserves their immunoprivilege.",Differential effects of N-acetylcysteine on retinal degeneration in two mouse models of normal tension glaucoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30692515,Cell death & disease,2019 02 01,"N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is widely used as a mucolytic agent and as an antidote to paracetamol overdose. NAC serves as a precursor of cysteine and stimulates the synthesis of glutathione in neural cells. Suppressing oxidative stress in the retina may be an effective therapeutic strategy for glaucoma, a chronic neurodegenerative disease of the retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and optic nerves. Here we examined the therapeutic potential of NAC in two mouse models of normal tension glaucoma, in which excitatory amino-acid carrier 1 (EAAC1) or glutamate/aspartate transporter (GLAST) gene was deleted. EAAC1 is expressed in retinal neurons including RGCs, whereas GLAST is mainly expressed in Müller glial cells. Intraperitoneal administration of NAC prevented RGC degeneration and visual impairment in EAAC1-deficient (knockout; KO) mice, but not in GLAST KO mice. In EAAC1 KO mice, oxidative stress and autophagy were suppressed with increased glutathione levels by NAC treatment. Our findings suggest a possibility that systemic administration of NAC may be available for some types of glaucoma patients.",The long non-coding RNA Linc-GALH promotes hepatocellular carcinoma metastasis via epigenetically regulating Gankyrin.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30692513,Cell death & disease,2019 02 01,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most prevalent subtype of liver cancer, and it is characterized by high rate of metastasis and recurrence. Recent studies have boosted our understanding that Gankyrin contributes to both of these pathological properties, but the mechanisms underlying its aberrant regulation are poorly understood. Recently, many long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been reported to be involved in regulating the expression of oncogenes and anti-oncogenes through various mechanisms. Here, using transcriptome microarray analysis, we identified a long intergenic noncoding RNA termed Linc-GALH that was highly expressed and concordance with Gankyrin expression in HCC. In addition, we revealed that Linc-GALH was an independent unfavorable prognostic indicator for HCC, followed functional experiments showed that Linc-GALH promoted HCC cells migration and invasion in vitro, and enhanced lung metastasis ability of HCC cells in vivo. Mechanistically, we found that Linc-GALH could regulate the expression of Gankyrin through controlling the methylation status of Gankyrin by adjusting the ubiquitination status of DNMT1 in HCC. Collectively, our results demonstrated the role and functional mechanism of Linc-GALH in HCC, and indicated that Linc-GALH may act as a prognostic biomarker and potential therapeutic target for HCC."

At diagnosis, the 65- year-old woman underwent right hemicolectomy for advanced ascending colon cancer with multiple liver metastases (T3N1M1[H2], Stage Ⅳ). The 11 liver metastatic lesions were treated by weekly HAI of 5-fluorouracil(5-FU). The lesions reduced in size(response rate 28.9%)immediately following treatment, and no new lesions were detected, but 10 months after treatment the size of the S2 tumor had increased. Systemic chemotherapy with irinotecan and S-1 was administered. Continued development of the S2 tumor in the liver prompted a radical lateral segment hepatectomy. Four months later, a computed tomography(CT)scan revealed a S6 tumor of the liver, for which a posterior segment hepatectomy was performed. A CT scan showing a S1 tumor in the liver 9 months later resulted in chemotherapeutic treatment with CapeOX, followed by mFOLFOX6. Despite treatment, the S1 tumor developed further, prompting a S1 partial hepatectomy. A further partial S8 hepatectomy was performed 7 years after surgery for the primary lesion following a CT scan that revealed a S8 tumor in the liver. There has been no recurrence of tumors in the 5 years and 5 months since this last hepatectomy.",[A Case of Long-Term Disease-Free Survival of a Gastric Cancer Patient with Peritoneal Dissemination and Transverse Colon Invasion].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30692498,Gan to kagaku ryoho.

Contrast-enhanced abdominal CT revealed gastric wall thickening in the midgastric region and direct invasion ofthe transverse colon. CT findings also revealed a suspicion ofdissemination on the omentum and para-aortic lymph node swelling. We diagnosed gastric cancer with transverse colon invasion. Therefore, we performed distal gastrectomy with transverse colectomy and D2+No.16b1 lymph node dissection after obtaining patient consent. We observed direct tumor invasion into the transverse colon and seeding nodules on the omentum. Liver metastasis was not seen, and ascitic cytology was negative.

A neoplastic lesion in the lower abdomen was revealed, and she was referred to our department. Enhanced CT showed wall thickening in the urinary bladder and a 6 cm mass that extended to the appendix. An appendiceal tumor invading the urinary bladder or a urinary bladder tumor invading the appendix was suspected, and we planned surgical treatment. One month later, we repeated enhanced CT scanning on admission. The mass had shrunk, but the thickening of the urinary bladder wall remained, and an enhanced appendiceal tumor was visible. Surgery was performed and we found a 1 cm appendiceal tumor. Intraoperative pathological examination revealed appendiceal cancer. Therefore, we performed ileocecal resection, D2 lymph node dissection, and partial cystectomy. Final histopathological examination revealed appendiceal cancer with pT2N0M0, pStage Ⅰ.

Cancer & chemotherapy,2019 04 12,"The prognosis of patients with esophageal cancer recurrence is poor, and surgical treatment is rarely performed. Here, we report on a patient with long-term survival who underwent pulmonary metastasis resection twice after curative resection of esophageal cancer. A 62-year-old male underwent curative resection of esophageal cancer after preoperative chemoradiotherapy. The histopathological diagnosis was poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma(pT2N1M0, fStage Ⅱ). Five months after the operation, right lung metastasis(right-S2)was detected. Accordingly, pulmonary metastasis resection was performed. Fourteen months after the initial operation, left lung metastases(left-S3/S6)were detected. The patient underwent resection again for the pulmonary metastases. The patient died of pneumonia without recurrence 8 years 3 months after the initial operation. In selected cases, surgical resection seems effective for treating distant esophageal cancer metastasis, suggesting that surgery should be an option in cases of accumulation of numerous distant metastases in esophageal cancer.",[Three Long-Surviving Cases of Recurrent Rectal Carcinomas Treated Non-Surgically and Cured].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30692495,Gan to kagaku ryoho.

Case No. 1 was of a 66-year-old woman, who underwent ISR for very low rectal cancer. Her disease Stage was tub2, T2N0M0. Two years and 6 months later, she developed intrapelvic recurrence involving sacral bones(S1-S3). Radiotherapy of 50 Gy followed by mFOLFOX6 with bevacizumab was administered for a year. She has been cancer-free for 6 years. Case No. 2 was of a 47-year-old man who underwent preoperative CRT of 40 Gy with 5-FU plus Leucovorin, and LAR was performed for very low rectal cancer. The disease Stage was tub2, T3N2M0. One year later, he was diagnosed with recurrent aortic lymph node metastasis. After 7 months of mFOLFOX6 with bevacizumab, he developed an anastomotic fistula. His chemotherapy was discontinued; he was cancer-free for 6 years. Case No. 3 was of a 56-year-old man who underwent TPE for low rectal cancer. The disease Stage was muc, T4b(urinary bladder)N0M1a(perianal skin). One year and 6 months later, he developed ileus and was diagnosed with intrapelvic recurrence. He underwent intestinal bypass operation, and CRT of 46 Gy with capecitabine was administered. He attained CR quickly, and was cancer-free for 5 years.

Cancer & chemotherapy,2019 04 12,"We report a case of advanced gastric cancer accompanied with skip lymph node metastasis in the retro portal region only. An 81-year-old man was referred to our hospital because of epigastric pain. CT examination of the abdomen revealed a gastric tumor and a tumor of 3.5 cm in diameter behind the portal vein and pancreatic head, which had high concentrations of FDG(SUVmax=8.5)on PET-CT examination. Thus, we diagnosed lymph node metastasis of the gastric cancer. We performed distal gastrectomyand en bloc resection of regional lymph nodes(D2 plus retro portal and retro pancreatic head nodes). In pathological examinations, the gastric tumor was diagnosed as poorlydifferentiated adenocarcinoma(por1, T3, INF b, ly1, v0). There were no metastatic nodes in perigastric lymph nodes, but the only metastasis was observed in the bulky lymph node, which was indicated by preoperative examinations. Postoperative course was uneventful.

Cancer & chemotherapy,2019 04 12,"A 90-year-old male underwent total gastrectomy for gastric cancer 10 months earlier. The cancer was pathologically diagnosed as Stage ⅢA. Preoperative serum CA19-9 level was as high as 1,326 U/mL, but quickly decreased after surgery. Although the serum CA19-9 level gradually re-increased, CT did not reveal recurrence of the disease. Ten months following surgery, the patient visited our hospital due to vomiting, and ileus was suspected because of finding of sigmoid colon tumors in the abdominalCT. Colonoscopy showed a circumferentialtumor with severe stenosis in the sigmoid colon, which was diagnosed as tubular adenocarcinoma by biopsy. After preoperative diagnosis of multiple colon cancers, sigmoidectomy was performed. A total of 4 tumors were revealed in the resected specimen. Pathological findings showed cancer cells with nuclear atypia in all tumors, which was very similar to findings in the previous gastric cancer. Immunohistochemical staining confirmed high expression of CA19-9 in both gastric and colon tumors. We concluded that the tumors were metastases of the CA19-9 producing gastric cancer.",[Resection of a Desmoid Tumor Originating from the Greater Omentum after Surgery for Colon Cancer and Liver Metastasis-A Case Report].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30692492,Gan to kagaku ryoho. Cancer & chemotherapy,2019 04 12,"Here, we report the case of a 66-year-old male patient who previously underwent resection of sigmoid colon cancer and its liver metastasis. His follow-up contrast-enhanced CT scan revealed a mass shadow at around the gastrosplenic ligament, which gradually increased in size. Because it could not be pathologically diagnosed by transgastric EUS-FNA, en bloc resection wasperformed surgically for the tumor in the greater omentum. Hematoxylin-eosin staining of the resected specimen showed fibroblast-like cellswith hyperplasia of bold collagen fibersand spindle-shaped nucleus. While the immunostaining findings denied a diagnosis of mesenchymal neoplasm such as GIST, leiomyosarcoma, or schwannoma, it was pathologically diagnosed as a desmoid tumor. He has been followed up without any recurrence for 2-and-a-half years after the surgical resection. Desmoid tumors tend to be locally invasive; thus, there is the potential for local recurrence, although the frequency of distant metastasis is very low. In cases in which the tumor increases in size, en bloc resection with sufficient surgical margin should be performed. Cases of desmoid tumors originating from the greater omentum are reportedly rare; however, en bloc resection may be useful for both diagnosis and treatment of tumors of the greater omentum showing increased size that are also surgically resectable."

Computed tomography(CT)showed an enlarged tumor with portal invasion(vp2)in segment 8 and intrahepaticmetastasis. We performed right and partial hepatectomy. Three months later, CT showed multiple lung metastases. We initiated the daily administration of 800 mg of sorafenib. However, 6 months after hepatectomy, the lung metastases increased in size and number. We considered the therapeutic effect as progressive disease(PD)according to the RECIST criteria. We then initiated administering 120 mg of regorafenib daily as second-line therapy. In a course of the treatment containing sorafenib and regorafenib, the dose was reduced due to hand-foot skin reactions. 8.5 months after hepatectomy, the lung metastases significantly decreased in size.

Abdominal CT showed a 25mm tumor in the left adrenal gland. The patient was diagnosed with adrenal Cushing's syndrome based on low ACTH levels, disappearance of circadian variation in blood cortisol levels, lack of inhibition by dexamethasone loading, and high urinary cortisol levels. Laparoscopic adrenalectomy for left adrenal tumor and low anterior resection for rectal cancer were performed. The pathological findings were rectal cancer, pap, pT1b(SM), pN0, cM0, fStageⅠof rectal cancer, and adrenal cortical adenoma. The postoperative course was uneventful with steroid replacement therapy. The ileal stoma was closed 4 months after surgery. Surgery in hyperadrenalism requires perioperative steroid replacement therapy because of the risk of postoperative acute adrenal failure.

He underwent 2 courses of FOLFIRI plus panitumumab(Pmab)as first-line therapy, 15courses of capecitabine plus bevacizumab(Bmab)as second-line therapy, and 27 courses of Pmab as third-line therapy. He developed various complications throughout the disease course, such as heart disease, diabetic gangrene in both legs, and abscess of liver metastasis. The tumor marker levels after each event were higher than the previous event and subsequently decreased with the resumption of chemotherapy. However, after 27 courses of Pmab, his liver and para-aortic lymph node metastases exacerbated, and he ultimately died from a poor general condition at 42 months after the initial recurrence of liver metastasis.

Laparoscopic right hemicolectomy(R2)was performed. The pathologic findings were a mixture of well-differentiated adenocarcinoma and well-differentiated mucinous carcinoma, grade 1, pStage ⅣA (pT2N0M1bG1). Six months after surgery, she is undergoing adjuvant chemotherapy at an outpatient clinic. Case 2: A 48- year-old woman. At surgery, invasion into the terminal ileum was observed. A laparoscopic right hemicolectomy resection (R0)was performed. The pathological diagnosis was Stage Ⅱ(pT4bN0M0). She has been followed-upat an outpatient clinic. Discussion: Case 1 had a relatively good prognosis if only well-differentiated mucinous carcinoma was seeded; however, because of the co-existence of well-differentiated adenocarcinoma, postoperative chemotherapy was performed. Case 2 was diagnosed with invasive mucinous carcinoma(grade 2), but because there was no dissemination or lymph node metastasis, follow-upfor Stage Ⅱ disease without adjuvant therapy was considered appropriate.

Computed tomography showed a 5 cm tumor(diameter)in the sigmoid mesocolon. We performed laparoscopic Hartmann operation; however, because of sacral invasion of tumor, curative surgery was difficult. Therefore, the tumor was excised together with the sigmoid colon. Histopathological examination of the tumor confirmed the diagnosis of epithelioid sarcoma. Postoperatively, the patient received heavy-particle radiotherapy at another facility as treatment for the residual tumor. The size of the residual tumor decreased 6 months after the surgery. Up until 1 year after surgery, the patient's condition has remained stable without any disease progression. Epithelioid sarcoma is a rare soft-tissue tumor and often leads to a poor prognosis.

Cancer & chemotherapy,2019 04 12,"A 57-year-old female underwent abdominoperineal resection for rectal cancer. Although she received postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy, she had presacral recurrence with pain 26 months postoperatively. We provided palliative care in parallel with systemic chemotherapy, but she had difficulty controlling pain despite using high-dose opioids at 43 months after surgery. Multimodal therapy contributed to a reduction in opioid use for a brief time. Nevertheless, she required high-dose opioid therapy again at 50 months after the procedure. Since she used a rescue dose for relieving anticipatory anxiety for pain, we estimated that she developed chemical coping. After we tried analgesic adjuvant therapy and psychotherapy, her opioid use was reduced. For 10 months afterward, her disease worsened with time, but her pain was well-controlled. In cases where it is difficult to control pain, protection against exacerbation or opioid dose escalation should be considered. Furthermore, psychological contexts, including chemical coping, should also be considered.

Subjective and objective symptoms were not observed; however, chest computed tomography findings revealed a thrombus in the pulmonary artery that was considered to be associated with bevacizumab. Chemotherapy was discontinued, and anticoagulation therapy was initiated with heparin and then switched to apixaban. The thrombus resolved with treatment, but the patient died following an increase in peritoneal dissemination. CapeOX plus bevacizumab is a recommended colon cancer treatment, and even though it is generally considered safe, the side effects of bevacizumab include relatively rare occurrences of gastrointestinal perforation or thrombosis. The frequency of pulmonary embolism associated with bevacizumab is approximately 0.1%, and fatalities have been reported. The possibility of asymptomatic thrombosis warrants regular monitoring of this serious side effect in patients receiving bevacizumab. Early detection and prompt antithrombotic treatment are necessary to ensure patient safety and continued disease management.",[A Case of Type 4 Gastric Cancer with Esophageal Invasion That Responded to Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy Containing S-1 and Oxaliplatin followed by Surgery].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30692453,Gan to kagaku ryoho. Cancer & chemotherapy,2019 04 12,"We encountered a case of type 4 gastric cancer with esophageal invasion that responded to neoadjuvant chemotherapy containing S-1 and oxaliplatin(SOX)followed by surgery, which could be curative resection. A 46-year-old man was referred to our hospital because of abnormal upper gastrointestinal series findings. He was diagnosed with type 4 advanced gastric cancer with esophageal invasion, cT4b(diaphragm)N2M0, Stage ⅢC, and 3 courses of neoadjuvant SOX therapy were administered. Adverse events were minor. After NAC, the primary lesion and lymph nodes showed marked reductions on CT; total gastrectomy and subtotal thoracic esophagectomy were performed. The pathological response to NAC was evaluated as Grade 2 in the primary tumor and Grade 3 in the lymph node; overall, NAC showed considerable antitumor effects. The final diagnosis was ypT3N0M0P0CY0H0, StageⅡA, and was judged as curatively resected.

Cancer & chemotherapy,2019 04 12,"We examined the influence of the sidedness of the primary tumor on survival of patients with colon cancer perforation. The subjects of this retrospective study were 52 patients who underwent surgery for colon perforation between April 2005 and December 2016 at our institution and survived more than 30 days. Patients with perforation of the oral side of the tumor were included. The background data and survival times were compared between 9 patients whose primary tumors were located in the cecum, ascending colon, or transverse colon(right-side group)and 43 patients whose primary tumors were located in the descending colon, sigmoid colon, or rectum(left-side group). There was no significant difference in terms of age, sex, Stage, or rate of chemotherapy, but Hinchey stage was significantly higher in the left-side group(p<0.05). The median survival time tended to be longer in the left-side group(68.2 months vs 21.2 months, p=0.05). These results suggest that right-side perforation might cause a poorer prognosis than left-side perforation in patients with perforative colorectal cancer.",[A Case of Successful Control of Advanced Duodenal Cancer with Liver Metastasis Receiving Paclitaxel Chemotherapy and Potential Radical Resection].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30692451,Gan to kagaku ryoho.

A woman in her 70s with epigastralgia was diagnosed with hemorrhagic duodenal ulcer upon upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. A type 3 tumor was found in the duodenal bulb upon upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and biopsy at our hospital. By contrast CT, we found wall hypertrophy of the duodenal bulb, lymph node metastasis, and liver metastasis and started chemotherapy. Four courses of SOX therapy were first administered. The wall hypertrophy of the duodenal bulb worsened, and new lesions appeared in the liver, so we diagnosed progressive disease. Next, 4 courses of wPTX therapy were administered. The wall hypertrophy of the duodenal bulb improved, and all liver metastatic lesions shrunk and became obscure. The reduction rate was 75%, so we diagnosed partial response. Accumulation in the primary tumor was observed on PET-CT, and the lymph node and liver metastases disappeared, so we considered radical curative resection. The patient underwent subtotal stomach preserving pancreatoduodenectomy, D2 lymph node dissection, reconstruction of the digestive tract by the modified CHILD method, partial hepatectomy, and Brawn's anastomosis. No cancer cells were found in the hepatectomized area. Paclitaxel chemotherapy may be useful for advanced duodenal cancer."

Cancer & chemotherapy,2019 04 12,"The pedicled pectoralis major myocutaneous(PMMC)flap, used for the reconstruction of surgical defects in advanced oral cancer resection, is versatile and can be obtained without a highly-invasive procedure. However, flap utility is limited by an unstable blood supply and the relatively high rate of partial necrosis of the skin island. Thus, the use of microvascularized free flaps has become more common in patients requiring oral-maxillofacial reconstruction. Detailed angiographic studies revealed the 3-dimensional vascular anatomy of the PMMC flap. This allowed us to obtain a modified, heart-shaped flap with a skin island that includes the intramuscular vascular networks between the pectoral branches of the thoracoacromial vessels and the intercostal perforators of the internal mammary vessels, thus ensuring a sufficient blood supply and stable survival of the flap. We have used this technique since 2015 to treat 7 patients with locally advanced or recurrent(salvage)oralcancer. None developed critical flap problems, and survival of the total skin island was successfully obtained in all cases. Transfer of the heart-shaped PMMC, including the multiple intercostal perforators from the internal mammary vessels, may contribute to a stable blood supply of the skin island and therefore can be effective for advanced oral cancer reconstruction.",[Outcomes of Anal Squamous Cell Carcinoma Treated with Chemoradiotherapy].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30692394,Gan to kagaku ryoho.

Grade 3 adverse effects occurred in 3 patients, but all 11 patients completed CRT. The anal lesions of 10 patients had complete response after CRT. Recurrence of anal lesions occurred in 4 patients, including 2 patients who were not treated with standard CRT. Of 8 patients who received CR via standard CRT, 2 patients had recurrence of anal lesions more than 60 months after completion of CRT. CRT is believed to be safe and effective for improving the prognosis of anal squamous cell carcinoma; however, sufficient and appropriate follow-up is necessary after complete response.",[Neuroendocrine Carcinoma of the Breast Encountered in the General Hospital without the Breast Department-A Case Report].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30692393,Gan to kagaku ryoho. Cancer & chemotherapy,2019 04 12,"Neuroendocrine carcinoma(NEC)is a rare disease. We report a case of NEC encountered in the general hospital without a breast department. The patient was a 69-year-old woman. She had received breast cancer screening and a mass on her left breast was found. Mammography revealed an ill-defined mass. Ultrasonography showed a low echoic mass, 11mm in diameter, on the A area of her left breast. A core needle biopsy of the breast tumor(A area)led to a diagnosis of an invasive ductal carcinoma, positive for estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor, but negative for HER2/neu. The Ki-67 positive cell index was 5%. We then examined her whole body and diagnosed her with T1N0M0, Stage Ⅰ. She underwent muscle-preserving mastectomy plus sentinel lymph node biopsy. The pathological diagnosis from the resected surgical specimen was invasive ductal carcinoma(NEC), positive for estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor, but negative for HER2/neu. The Ki-67 positive cell index was 5%. The surgical margins were negative, and no metastasis was found in the sentinel lymph node. She was administered endocrine therapy as adjuvant therapy.

Cancer & chemotherapy,2019 04 12,"The patient was an 82-year-old man who received a total of 25 courses of GEM/CDDP therapy for unresectable distal bile duct cancer with multiple liver metastases. After the chemotherapy, no liver metastasis was detected on computed tomography. Then, he underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy(ⅡA-1, D2)as a conversion surgery(T2N0M0, fStageⅠB)at 2 years and 11 months after the initial diagnosis. Postoperatively, the patient received GEM therapy for 2 years and had no recurrence. Three years and 10 months after the surgery, computed tomography revealed a tumorous lesion with a poor contrasting effect on the remaining pancreas and a positive accumulation of SUVmax 8.6 was detected at the same site through the FDG-PET examination. We diagnosed the lesion as residual pancreatic cancer and performed remnant total pancreatectomy and splenectomy. The histopathological findings showed tumors arising from the residual pancreatic epithelium; therefore, we diagnosed his lesion as residual pancreatic cancer(T3N1aM0, fStage ⅡB). After the second surgery, he is being treated with adjuvant therapy with S-1 and is alive without recurrence. In this case, long-term survival was possible for 7 years and 4 months from the initial diagnosis of unresectable distal bile duct cancer. Metachronous double cancer of unresectable bile duct and pancreatic cancer is presumed to have a poor prognosis.

Although distal gastrectomy with D2 lymphadenectomy was planned, the tumor was considered as unresectable with peritoneal metastases during laparotomy. After the subsequent chemotherapy with 1 course of capecitabine plus cisplatin, tumor bleeding, and obstruction due to rapid tumor progression occurred. We performed palliative distal gastrectomy; however, the patient died 17 days after gastrectomy. A comprehensive genomic analysis using cancer-gene panel identified the tumor as a microsatellite instability-high(MSI-H).

She visited our hospital with a diagnosis of colonic obstruction. Her abdomen was evidently distended and tender. CT revealed the apple core sign in the transverse colon-hepatic flexure area, and then bowel obstruction. The disseminated lesion occluded the superior mesenteric vein. Multiple masses were found on both lungs; a single tumor was detected in liver S6. Hence, we diagnosed her with unresectable obstructive transverse colon cancer. A colonic stent was inserted to remove the obstruction. Because primary tumor resection was rendered impossible, mFOLFOX6 was initiated with the colonic stent intact. After 5 courses, CT revealed that the liver metastasis disappeared, and lung metastases exhibited SD of a therapeutic effect. She further received 5 courses of mFOLFOX6 and 20 courses of maintenance therapy using FU. However, single liver metastasis recurred, exhibiting PD of a therapeutic effect.

We identified this anal stenosis as anal canal adenocarcinoma(moderately differentiated). Thereby, no distant metastasis was found; we decided to treat the patient with conventional therapy. We made a double-hole colostomy in the sigmoid colon, and then the patient received preoperative chemoradiotherapy(CRT). Radiation therapy(RT)was adminis- tered at 40 Gy/20 Fr and oral capecitabine of 825mg/m / 2/time was administered twice a day on the RT days. The tumor shrinkage was good, and then we performed a laparoscopy-assisted abdominoperineal resection of the rectum. Pathologically therapeutic effect was Grade 1b. His activity of daily living was dramatically improved, and he can now main tan the sitting position. Twelve months postoperatively, he has no sign of recurrence. In this case, we experienced an anal canal adenocarcinoma that was possibly locally controlled by preoperative CRT and rectal amputation."

A 65-year-old man visited another hospital with left upper abdominal pain. He was diagnosed with upper GI perforation, and conservative medical management was selected because peritonitis was limited. After close examination, a Type 3 tumor was found in the cardiac region of the stomach. As the advanced gastric cancer was unresectable, chemotherapy, comprising4 courses of SP plus T-mab, was subsequently administered. As the therapeutic effect was PR, we performed total gastrectomy.

The 1-, 3-, and 5- year survival rates in all 24 cases were 63%, 21%, and 17%, respectively. Single variable analysis revealed that significant factors of poor prognosis were 3 or more liver metastases, synchronous liver metastasis, and positive surgical margin. Multivariable analysis revealed that significant independent factors of poor prognosis were synchronous liver metastases(HR 4.71, 95%CI: 1.08-21.79, p=0.040)and positive surgical margin(HR 5.95, 95%CI: 1.56-25.81, p=0.009).

Subjects comprised 61 patients who underwent curative resection at our hospital for colorectal cancer accompanied by synchronous liver metastasis between 1996 and 2014. The degree of liver metastasis was H1 for 47 cases and H2 for 14 cases. The Grade of liver metastasis was A for 29 cases, B for 18 cases, and C for 14 cases. Liver resection was performed simultaneously with that of the primary lesion for 33 cases, and after that of the primary lesion for 28 cases. The post-curative resection survival period was 58.0 months, and the 5-year survival rate was 49.9%. In terms of the relationship between prognosis and clinicopathological factors, prognosis was found to be poor when the wall depth of the primary lesion was pT4 and when the liver metastasis Grade was B or C. Meanwhile, prognosis did not differ depending on the timing of liver metastasis resection, whether chemotherapy was performed after liver resection, and whether curative resection was performed for initial occurrence only or recurrence resection was performed. The results indicated that for cases of colorectal cancer with synchronous liver metastasis, primary lesion wall depth and liver metastasis Grade were prognostic factors, and that the treatment strategy did not necessarily have to consider resection timing."

Ultrasonography showed a 15.5×7.2mm sized irregular mass at the left BD area. Vacuum-assisted biopsy did not reveal any malignant cells. After 3 months, ultrasonography reexamination showed that the irregular mass had increased to 24.2×16.5mm in size, and it had spread to multiple axillary lymph nodes. The patient was diagnosed with breast cancer by core needle biopsy of the axillary lymph node. Total mastectomy with axillary lymph node dissection was performed. The pathological diagnosis was solid-tubular carcinoma with infarcted necrosis. The number of metastatic axillary lymph nodes was confirmed to be 23 in total. This case was considered very rare and important because there have been very few reports of breast cancer with infarcted necrosis.",[A Patient with Multiple Pancreatic Metastases Undergoing Total Pancreatectomy 18 Years after Renal Cell Carcinoma Resection].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30692335,Gan to kagaku ryoho.

Nine months after the start of chemoradiotherapy, a 60 mm sized mass was identified in the spleen on abdominal CT. FDG-PET/CT examination revealed abnormal FDG accumulation in the tumor, and no obvious accumulation was observed in other sites. By endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration cytology, the tumor was diagnosed as splenic metastasis from lung cancer. Since the primary lung tumor was well controlled by the chemoradiotherapy and no metastatic lesions were found except in the spleen, laparoscopic excision of the splenic metastasis was planned. Since the tumor was suspected to have infiltrated the tail of the pancreas, laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy were performed. There were no severe postoperative complications. The resected tumor was histopathologically diagnosed as not splenic metastasis, but lymph node metastasis at the splenic hilum from lung cancer invading the pancreas and spleen. Brain metastasis and bone metastasis were observed 3 months postoperatively. He did not undergo any treatments for the metastatic lesions, and he died because of the cancer 11 months after the operation.

Screening of the adenocarcinoma samples for Lynch syndrome by immunohistochemistry for mismatch repair proteins indicated a loss of MSH2/MSH6 proteinexpression . A genetic test revealed a deletion of about 20 kb, including exons 8 and 9 of the EPCAM gene. Colonoscopy revealed a type 1 tumor in the cecum. The risk of developing metachronous colorectal cancer and postoperative survival according to the extent of colectomy(total colectomy versus segmental colectomy)and her marked obesity were considered collectively. The patient subsequently selected total colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis. Pathological findings revealed mucinous carcinoma(Stage Ⅱ).

Imaging examination revealed the presence of a primary tumor associated with stenosis, extending from the rectosigmoid junction to the upper rectum, multiple liver metastases, and massive ascites. Pathological examination indicated well-differentiated adenocarcinoma. A treatment strategy comprising colostomy and chemotherapy was implemented. Administration of 6 courses of mFOLFOX6 plus panitumumab(Pmab)and 4 courses of FOLFIRI plus Pmab led to marked shrinkage of the primary tumor and liver metastases and disappearance of the ascites. Chemotherapy was discontinued at the request of the patient. The patient developed melena after 2 years. Colonoscopy revealed enlargement of the rectal cancer, and surgical intervention was indicated. We adopted a treatment policy of 2-stage resection, and low anterior resection was performed.

Plastic surgeons have recently begun to use leeches to reduce venous congestion after flap reconstruction. However, few reports of leech use in the oral region have been published. We report a case of medical leech therapy used to treat venous congestion after forearm flap reconstruction for oral cancer. A 67-year-old female was diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma of the left tongue margin(cT2N0M0, Stage Ⅱ). The patient underwent tracheostomy, supraomohyoid neck dissection, hemiglossectomy, and reconstruction using a free forearm flap under general anesthesia. Venous congestion in the forearm flap was detected 21 hours postoperatively, and reanastomosis of the flap was performed. However, venous congestion continued after revision surgery. Therefore, we introduced medical leech therapy to treat the venous congestion. Leeches were used twice daily for 5 days, and the total hematophagy volume was 21.6 g.

CT revealed that the tumor was located in the 2nd part of the duodenum, was about 7 cm in diameter, and was suspected to invade the superior mesenteric vein (SMV). Gastroendoscopy revealed whole-circumference stenosis at the 2nd part of the duodenum. The biopsy was suspicious of duodenal metastasis from pulmonary pleomorphic carcinoma. We scheduled pancreaticoduodenectomy with reconstruction of the portal vein. Regarding the intraoperative findings, the tumor was palpated at the 2nd part of the duodenum, and the tumor invaded the transverse colon and right urinary duct. The SMV had been invaded from the gastro-colic trunk to the root of the ileocolic vein. Therefore, pancreaticoduodenectomy, reconstruction of the portal vein with replacement of the graft of the left external iliac vein, right hemicolectomy, and right ureteral resection were performed. Regarding the pathological findings, the tumor existed in the pancreatic parenchyma and invaded the duodenal mucosa. The tumor cells were similar to those in a previous pulmonary pleomorphic carcinoma. The final pathological diagnosis was pancreatic metastases from pulmonary pleomorphic carcinoma.

Case 1 involved a 58-year-old woman. In December 2011, colostomy and chemotherapy were performed for locally advanced rectal cancer. In June 2012, we performed low anterior resection. In January 2014, chemotherapy was started for pelvic recurrence. She discontinued treatment for 4 months due to personal circumstances. Recurrence was worsened, and infection caused sepsis and she was admitted to the hospital in February 2017. Infection was not improved with antibiotic drugs, and radiation therapy(60 Gy/30 times)was performed. Infection was improved, and panitumumab monotherapy was started and she was discharged. Case 2 involved a 61-year-old man. In February 2014, a lower anterior resection for rectal cancer was performed. In September 2015, chemotherapy was started for pelvic recurrence. In November 2016, chemotherapy was discontinued due to esophageal variceal rupture. Recurrence was worsened, and infection caused sepsis and he was admitted to the hospital in May 2017. Radiation therapy(50 Gy/20 times)was performed after colostomy.

Cancer & chemotherapy,2019 04 12,"A 60s man with a history of laparoscopic distal gastrectomy(LDG)of gastric cancer in January 2015was followed up in an outpatient clinic. He remained healthy without recurrence for about 2 years, but in February 2017, colonoscopy identified an elevated lesion that covered one-third of the circumference in the ascending colon. Biopsy revealed that this lesion had poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. No other metastatic lesions were noted on thoraco-abdominal CT, and tumor markers were not elevated in a blood test. Right hemicolectomy with D3 nodal dissection was performed on March 2017. Although regional lymph node metastasis was noted during surgery, distant metastasis was not identified. Histological examination revealed that the ascending colon tumor had poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma very similar to that of the primary gastric cancer, and the lesion was diagnosed as metastasis from previous gastric carcinoma. Pathological findings showed pPM0, pDM0, pRM0, pCY0, and definitive surgical treatment was confirmed. However, 2 months after the surgery, ascites caused by peritoneal and bilateral supraclavicular lymph node metastases were detected on CT. He passed away 6months after the last surgery.

Cytology has low sensitivity and there is a need to identify biomarkers that could identify dysplasia that are likely to progress to cancer. We searched for plasma proteins that could identify women with cervical cancer using the multiplex proximity extension assay (PEA). The abundance of 100 proteins were measured in plasma collected at the time of diagnosis of patients with invasive cervical cancer and in population controls using the Olink Multiplex panels CVD II, INF I, and ONC II. Eighty proteins showed increased levels in cases compared with controls. We identified a signature of 11 proteins (PTX3, ITGB1BP2, AXIN1, STAMPB, SRC, SIRT2, 4E-BP1, PAPPA, HB-EGF, NEMO and IL27) that distinguished cases and controls with a sensitivity of 0.96 at a specificity of 1.0. This signature was evaluated in a prospective replication cohort with samples collected before, at or after diagnosis and achieved a sensitivity of 0.78 and a specificity 0.56 separating samples collected at the time of diagnosis of invasive cancer from samples collected prior to diagnosis. No difference in abundance was seen between samples collected prior to diagnosis or after treatment as compared with population controls, indicating that this protein signature is mainly informative close to time of diagnosis. Further studies are needed to determine the optimal window in time prior to diagnosis for these biomarker candidates.",Zfp423 Regulates Skeletal Muscle Regeneration and Proliferation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30692273,Molecular and cellular biology,2019 04 14,"Satellite cells (SCs) are skeletal muscle stem cells that proliferate in response to injury and provide myogenic precursors for growth and repair. Zfp423 is a transcriptional cofactor expressed in multiple immature cell populations, such as neuronal precursors, mesenchymal stem cells, and preadipocytes, where it regulates lineage allocation, proliferation, and differentiation. Here, we show that Zfp423 regulates myogenic progression during muscle regeneration. Zfp423 is undetectable in quiescent SCs but becomes expressed during SC activation. After expansion, Zfp423 is gradually downregulated as committed SCs terminally differentiate. Mice with satellite-cell-specific Zfp423 deletion exhibit severely impaired muscle regeneration following injury, with aberrant SC expansion, defective cell cycle exit, and failure to transition efficiently from the proliferative stage toward commitment. Consistent with a cell-autonomous role of Zfp423, shRNA-mediated knockdown of Zfp423 in myoblasts inhibits differentiation. Surprisingly, forced expression of Zfp423 in myoblasts induces differentiation into adipocytes and arrests myogenesis. Affinity purification of Zfp423 in myoblasts identified Satb2 as a nuclear partner of Zfp423 that cooperatively enhances Zfp423 transcriptional activity, which in turn affects myoblast differentiation. In conclusion, by controlling SC expansion and proliferation, Zfp423 is essential for muscle regeneration. Tight regulation of Zfp423 expression is essential for normal progression of muscle progenitors from proliferation to differentiation.",Reactive Oxygen Species Signaling Promotes Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1α Stabilization in Sonic Hedgehog-Driven Cerebellar Progenitor Cell Proliferation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30692272,Molecular and cellular biology,2019 04 14,"Cerebellar development is a highly regulated process involving numerous factors acting with high specificity, both temporally and by location. Part of this process involves extensive proliferation of cerebellar granule neuron precursors (CGNPs) induced by Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) signaling, but downstream effectors of mitogenic signaling are still being elucidated. Using primary CGNP cultures, a well-established model for SHH-driven proliferation, we show that SHH-treated CGNPs feature high levels of hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF1α), which is known to promote glycolysis, stemness, and angiogenesis. In CGNPs cultured under normoxic conditions, HIF1α is posttranslationally stabilized in a manner dependent upon reactive oxygen species (ROS) and NADPH oxidase (NOX), both of which are also upregulated in these cells. Inhibition of NOX activity resulted in HIF1α destabilization and reduced levels of cyclin D2, a marker of CGNP proliferation. As CGNPs are the putative cells of origin for the SHH subtype of medulloblastoma and aberrant SHH signaling is implicated in other neoplasms, these studies may also have future relevance in the context of cancer. Taken together, our findings suggest that a better understanding of nonhypoxic HIF1α stabilization through NOX-induced ROS generation can provide insights into normal cell proliferation in cerebellar development and SHH-driven cell proliferation in cancers with aberrant SHH signaling.",E3 Ubiquitin Ligases RNF20 and RNF40 Are Required for Double-Stranded Break (DSB) Repair: Evidence for Monoubiquitination of Histone H2B Lysine 120 as a Novel Axis of DSB Signaling and Repair.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30692271,Molecular and cellular biology,2019 04 14,"Histone posttranslational modifications play fundamental roles in the regulation of double-stranded DNA break (DSB) repair. RNF20/RNF40-mediated monoubiquitination of histone H2B on lysine 120 (H2Bub) has been suggested as a potential mediator of DSB repair, although the nature and function of this posttranslational modification remain enigmatic. In this report, we demonstrate that RNF20 and RNF40 are required for DSB repair leading to homologous recombination (HR) and class switch recombination, a process driven by nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ), in mouse B cells. These findings suggest a role for RNF20 and RNF40 in DSB repair proximal to NHEJ/HR pathway choice and likely in the signaling of DSBs. We found that DSBs led to a global increase in H2Bub but not the transcription-associated posttranslational modifications H3K4me3 and H3K79me2. We also found that H2AX phosphorylation was dispensable for H2Bub and that ATM and ATR jointly regulate ionizing radiation (IR)-induced H2Bub. Together, our results suggest that RNF20, RNF40, and H2Bub may represent a novel pathway for DSB sensing and repair.",Dynamic Methylation of an L1 Transduction Family during Reprogramming and Neurodifferentiation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30692270,Molecular and cellular biology,2019 04 14,"The retrotransposon LINE-1 (L1) is a significant source of endogenous mutagenesis in humans. In each individual genome, a few retrotransposition-competent L1s (RC-L1s) can generate new heritable L1 insertions in the early embryo, primordial germ line, and germ cells. L1 retrotransposition can also occur in the neuronal lineage and cause somatic mosaicism. Although DNA methylation mediates L1 promoter repression, the temporal pattern of methylation applied to individual RC-L1s during neurogenesis is unclear. Here, we identified a de novo L1 insertion in a human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) line via retrotransposon capture sequencing (RC-seq). The L1 insertion was full-length and carried 5' and 3' transductions. The corresponding donor RC-L1 was part of a large and recently active L1 transduction family and was highly mobile in a cultured-cell L1 retrotransposition reporter assay. Notably, we observed distinct and dynamic DNA methylation profiles for the de novo L1 and members of its extended transduction family during neuronal differentiation. These experiments reveal how a de novo L1 insertion in a pluripotent stem cell is rapidly recognized and repressed, albeit incompletely, by the host genome during neurodifferentiation, while retaining potential for further retrotransposition.",IMP2 Increases Mouse Skeletal Muscle Mass and Voluntary Activity by Enhancing Autocrine Insulin-Like Growth Factor 2 Production and Optimizing Muscle Metabolism.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30692269,Molecular and cellular biology,2019 04 14,"Insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) mRNA binding protein 2 (IMP2) was selectively deleted from adult mouse muscle; two phenotypes were observed: decreased accrual of skeletal muscle mass after weaning and reduced wheel-running activity but normal forced treadmill performance. Reduced wheel running occurs when mice are fed a high-fat diet but is normalized when mice consume standard chow. The two phenotypes are due to altered output from different IMP2 client mRNAs. The reduced fiber size of IMP2-deficient muscle is attributable, in part, to diminished autocrine Igf2 production; basal tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin and IGF1 receptors is diminished, and Akt1 activation is selectively reduced. Gsk3α is disinhibited, and S536-phosphorylated ε subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2B [eIF2Bε(S536)] is hyperphosphorylated. Protein synthesis is reduced despite unaltered mTOR complex 1 activity. The diet-dependent reduction in voluntary exercise is likely due to altered muscle metabolism, as contractile function is normal. IMP2-deficient muscle exhibits reduced fatty acid oxidation, due to a reduced abundance of mRNA of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα), an IMP2 client, and PPARα protein. IMP2-deficient muscle fibers treated with a mitochondrial uncoupler to increase electron flux, as occurs with exercise, exhibit reduced oxygen consumption from fatty acids, with higher oxygen consumption from glucose. The greater dependence on muscle glucose metabolism during increased oxygen demand may promote central fatigue and thereby diminish voluntary activity.",Stimulus complexity shapes response correlations in primary visual cortex.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30692266,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2019 03 27,"Spike count correlations (SCCs) are ubiquitous in sensory cortices, are characterized by rich structure, and arise from structured internal dynamics. However, most theories of visual perception treat contributions of neurons to the representation of stimuli independently and focus on mean responses. Here, we argue that, in a functional model of visual perception, featuring probabilistic inference over a hierarchy of features, inferences about high-level features modulate inferences about low-level features ultimately introducing structured internal dynamics and patterns in SCCs. Specifically, high-level inferences for complex stimuli establish the local context in which neurons in the primary visual cortex (V1) interpret stimuli. Since the local context differentially affects multiple neurons, this conjecture predicts specific modulations in the fine structure of SCCs as stimulus identity and, more importantly, stimulus complexity varies. We designed experiments with natural and synthetic stimuli to measure the fine structure of SCCs in V1 of awake behaving macaques and assessed their dependence on stimulus identity and stimulus statistics. We show that the fine structure of SCCs is specific to the identity of natural stimuli and changes in SCCs are independent of changes in response mean. Critically, we demonstrate that stimulus specificity of SCCs in V1 can be directly manipulated by altering the amount of high-order structure in synthetic stimuli. Finally, we show that simple phenomenological models of V1 activity cannot account for the observed SCC patterns and conclude that the stimulus dependence of SCCs is a natural consequence of structured internal dynamics in a hierarchical probabilistic model of natural images.",Fluorescent reconstitution on deposition of PM2.5 in lung and extrapulmonary organs.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30692265,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2019 05 14,"The deposition of PM2.5 (fine particulate matter in air with diameter smaller than 2.5 μm) in lungs is harmful to human health. However, real-time observation on the deposition of particles in the acinar area of the lung is still a challenge in experiments. Here, a fluorescent imaging method is developed to visualize the deposition process with a high temporal and spatial resolution. The observations reveal that the deposition pattern is nonuniform, and the maximum deposition rate in the acinar area differs significantly from the prediction of the widely used average deposition model. The method is also used to find single particles in the kidney and liver, though such particles are commonly believed to be too large to enter the extrapulmonary organs.",Developmental trajectory of social influence integration into perceptual decisions in children.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30692264,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2019 04 10,"The opinions of others have a profound influence on decision making in adults. The impact of social influence appears to change during childhood, but the underlying mechanisms and their development remain unclear. We tested 125 neurotypical children between the ages of 6 and 14 years on a perceptual decision task about 3D-motion figures under informational social influence. In these children, a systematic bias in favor of the response of another person emerged at around 12 years of age, regardless of whether the other person was an age-matched peer or an adult. Drift diffusion modeling indicated that this social influence effect in neurotypical children was due to changes in the integration of sensory information, rather than solely a change in decision behavior. When we tested a smaller cohort of 30 age- and IQ-matched autistic children on the same task, we found some early decision bias to social influence, but no evidence for the development of systematic integration of social influence into sensory processing for any age group. Our results suggest that by the early teens, typical neurodevelopment allows social influence to systematically bias perceptual processes in a visual task previously linked to the dorsal visual stream. That the same bias did not appear to emerge in autistic adolescents in this study may explain some of their difficulties in social interactions.",Fanconi anemia protein FANCI functions in ribosome biogenesis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30692263,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2019 05 14,"Fanconi anemia (FA) is a disease of DNA repair characterized by bone marrow failure and a reduced ability to remove DNA interstrand cross-links. Here, we provide evidence that the FA protein FANCI also functions in ribosome biogenesis, the process of making ribosomes that initiates in the nucleolus. We show that FANCI localizes to the nucleolus and is functionally and physically tied to the transcription of pre-ribosomal RNA (pre-rRNA) and to large ribosomal subunit (LSU) pre-rRNA processing independent of FANCD2. While FANCI is known to be monoubiquitinated when activated for DNA repair, we find that it is predominantly in the deubiquitinated state in the nucleolus, requiring the nucleoplasmic deubiquitinase (DUB) USP1 and the nucleolar DUB USP36. Our model suggests a possible dual pathophysiology for FA that includes defects in DNA repair and in ribosome biogenesis."

For example, little is known about the spatial variability of groundwater denitrification, an important process in removing nitrate originating from agriculture and land use conversion. Information about the rate, arrangement, and extent of denitrification is needed to determine sustainable limits of human activity and to predict recovery time frames. Here, we developed and validated a method for inferring the spatial organization of sequential biogeochemical reactions in an aquifer in France. We applied it to five other aquifers in different geological settings located in the United States and compared results among 44 locations across the six aquifers to assess the generality of reactivity trends. Of the sampling locations, 79% showed pronounced increases of reactivity with depth. This suggests that previous estimates of denitrification have underestimated the capacity of deep aquifers to remove nitrate, while overestimating nitrate removal in shallow flow paths. Oxygen and nitrate reduction likely increases with depth because there is relatively little organic carbon in agricultural soils and because excess nitrate input has depleted solid phase electron donors near the surface. Our findings explain the long-standing conundrum of why apparent reaction rates of oxygen in aquifers are typically smaller than those of nitrate, which is energetically less favorable. This stratified reactivity framework is promising for mapping vertical reactivity trends in aquifers, generating new understanding of subsurface ecosystems and their capacity to remove contaminants.",Torsional stress generated by ADF/cofilin on cross-linked actin filaments boosts their severing.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30692249,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2019 05 14,"Proteins of the actin depolymerizing factor (ADF)/cofilin family are the central regulators of actin filament disassembly. A key function of ADF/cofilin is to sever actin filaments. However, how it does so in a physiological context, where filaments are interconnected and under mechanical stress, remains unclear. Here, we monitor and quantify the action of ADF/cofilin in different mechanical situations by using single-molecule, single-filament, and filament network techniques, coupled to microfluidics. We find that local curvature favors severing, while tension surprisingly has no effect on cofilin binding and weakly enhances severing. Remarkably, we observe that filament segments that are held between two anchoring points, thereby constraining their twist, experience a mechanical torque upon cofilin binding. We find that this ADF/cofilin-induced torque does not hinder ADF/cofilin binding, but dramatically enhances severing. A simple model, which faithfully recapitulates our experimental observations, indicates that the ADF/cofilin-induced torque increases the severing rate constant 100-fold. A consequence of this mechanism, which we verify experimentally, is that cross-linked filament networks are severed by cofilin far more efficiently than nonconnected filaments. We propose that this mechanochemical mechanism is critical to boost ADF/cofilin's ability to sever highly connected filament networks in cells.",Impact of nuclear quantum effects on the structural inhomogeneity of liquid water.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30692247,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2019 05 14,"The 2D Raman-terahertz (THz) response of liquid water is studied in dependence of temperature and isotope substitution ([Formula: see text]O, [Formula: see text]O, and [Formula: see text]O). In either case, a very short-lived (i.e., between 75 and 95 fs) echo is observed that reports on the inhomogeneity of the low-frequency intermolecular modes and hence, on the heterogeneity of the hydrogen bond networks of water. The echo lifetime slows down by about 20% when cooling the liquid from room temperature to the freezing point. Furthermore, the echo lifetime of [Formula: see text]O is [Formula: see text] slower than that of [Formula: see text]O, and both can be mapped on each other by introducing an effective temperature shift of [Formula: see text] K.

This is due to the amplified contact angle hysteresis and insufficient driving force in the micrometer scale, especially for low-surface energy oil droplets. Coalescence of neighboring droplets, which releases vast additional surface energy, was often required, but its relatively uncontrollable nature brings uncertainties to the droplet motion, and the methodology is not applicable to single droplets. Here we introduce a strategy based on slippery surface with immobilized lubricant menisci to directionally transport microdroplets. By simply mounting hydrogel dots on slippery surface, the raised menisci remotely pump microdroplets via capillary force with high efficiency, regardless of droplet size or surface energy.

Single-marker, tag single nucleotide polymorphism (tagSNP) and gene-based analysis were performed on common variants near 54 syndromic obesity genes. We used publicly available data from meta-analyses of European BMI genome-wide association studies conducted by the Genetic Investigation of ANthropometric Traits (GIANT) Consortium and the UK Biobank (UKB) (N = 681,275 adults). A total of 33 loci were identified, of which 19 of 33 (57.6%) were located at SNPs previously identified by the GIANT Consortium and UKB meta-analysis, 11 of 33 (33.3%) were located at novel SNPs, and 3 of 33 (9.1%) were novel genes identified with gene-based analysis.

GSH is abundant in plants, with reported intracellular concentrations typically in the 1-10 mM range. Various aminotransferases can inadvertently transaminate the amino group of the γ-glutamyl moiety of GSH to produce deaminated glutathione (dGSH), a metabolite damage product. It was recently reported that an amidase known as Nit1 participates in dGSH breakdown in mammals and yeast. Plants have a hitherto uncharacterized homolog of the Nit1 amidase. We show that recombinant Arabidopsis Nit1 (At4g08790) has high and specific amidase activity towards dGSH. Ablating the Arabidopsis Nit1 gene causes a massive accumulation of dGSH and other marked changes to the metabolome. All plant Nit1 sequences examined had predicted plastidial targeting peptides with a potential second start codon whose use would eliminate the targeting peptide. In vitro transcription/translation assays show that both potential translation start codons in Arabidopsis Nit1 were used and confocal microscopy of Nit1-GFP fusions in plant cells confirmed both cytoplasmic and plastidial localization. Furthermore, we show that Arabidopsis enzymes present in leaf extracts convert GSH to dGSH at a rate of 2.8 pmol min-1 mg-1 in the presence of glyoxalate as an amino acceptor. Our data demonstrate that plants have a dGSH repair system that is directed to at least two cellular compartments via the use of alternative translation start sites.","Home Use of Day-and-Night Hybrid Closed-Loop Insulin Delivery in Very Young Children: A Multicenter, 3-Week, Randomized Trial.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30692242,Diabetes care,2019 03 21,We aimed to assess the feasibility and safety of hybrid closed-loop insulin delivery in children with type 1 diabetes aged 1-7 years as well as evaluate the role of diluted insulin on glucose control.,"Maternal and Newborn Vitamin D-Binding Protein, Vitamin D Levels, Vitamin D Receptor Genotype, and Childhood Type 1 Diabetes.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30692241,Diabetes care,2019 03 21,"Circumstantial evidence links 25-hydroxy vitamin D [25(OH)D], vitamin D-binding protein (DBP), vitamin D-associated genes, and type 1 diabetes (T1D), but no studies have jointly analyzed these.

A key integrator of glutamatergic signaling in the reward circuit is the nucleus accumbens, more specifically, the dopamine D1 receptor-expressing medium spiny neurons (D1-MSNs) within this region, which have been implicated in the formation of dependence to many drugs of abuse including alcohol. D1-MSNs receive glutamatergic input from several brain regions; however, it is not currently known how individual inputs onto D1-MSNs are altered by alcohol experience. Here, we investigate input-specific adaptations in glutamatergic transmission in response to varying levels of alcohol experience. Virally mediated expression of Channelrhodopsin in ventral hippocampal (vHipp) glutamate neurons of male mice allowed for selective activation of vHipp to D1-MSN synapses. Therefore, we were able to compare synaptic adaptations in response to low and high alcohol experience in vitro and in vivo Alcohol experience enhanced glutamatergic activity and abolished LTD at vHipp to D1-MSN synapses. Following chronic alcohol experience, GluA2-lacking AMPARs, which are Ca permeable, were inserted into vHipp to D1-MSN synapses. These findings support the reversal of alcohol-induced insertion of Ca-permeable AMPARs and the enhancement of glutamatergic activity at vHipp to D1-MSNs as potential targets for intervention during early exposure to alcohol.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Given the roles of the nucleus accumbens (NAc) in integrating cortical and allocortical information and in reward learning, it is vital to understand how inputs to this region are altered by drugs of abuse such as alcohol. The strength of excitatory inputs from the ventral hippocampus (vHipp) to the NAc has been positively associated with reward-related behaviors, but it is unclear whether or how ethanol affects these inputs. Here we show that vHipp-NAc synapses indeed are altered by ethanol exposure, with vHipp glutamatergic input to the NAc being enhanced following chronic ethanol experience. This work provides insight into ethanol-induced alterations of vHipp-NAc synapses and suggests that, similarly to drugs such as cocaine, the strengthening of these synapses promotes reward behavior.",An Essential Role of the Intraparietal Sulcus in Response Inhibition Predicted by Parcellation-Based Network.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30692225,The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,2019 04 18,"The posterior parietal cortex (PPC) features close anatomical and functional relationships with the prefrontal cortex. However, the necessity of the PPC in executive functions has been questioned. The present study used the stop-signal task to examine response inhibition, an executive function that inhibits prepotent response tendency. The brain activity and resting-state functional connectivity were measured to analyze a parcellation-based network that was aimed at identifying a candidate PPC region essential for response inhibition in humans. The intraparietal sulcus (IPS) was activated during response inhibition and connected with the inferior frontal cortex and the presupplementary motor area, the two frontal regions known to be necessary for response inhibition. Next, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was used to test the essential role of the IPS region for response inhibition. TMS over the IPS region prolonged the stop-signal reaction time (SSRT), the standard behavioral index used to evaluate stopping performance, when stimulation was applied 30-0 ms before stopping. On the contrary, stimulation over the temporoparietal junction region, an area activated during response inhibition but lacking connectivity with the two frontal regions, did not show changes in SSRT. These results indicate that the IPS identified using the parcellation-based network plays an essential role in executive functions.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Based on the previous neuropsychological studies reporting no impairment in executive functions after lesions in the posterior parietal cortex (PPC), the necessity of PPC in executive functions has been questioned. Here, contrary to the long-lasting view, by using recently developed analysis in functional MRI (""parcellation-based network analysis""), we identified the intraparietal sulcus (IPS) region in the PPC as essential for response inhibition: one executive function to stop actions that are inaccurate in a given context. The necessity of IPS for response inhibition was further tested by an interventional technique of transcranial magnetic stimulation. Stimulation to the IPS disrupted the performance of stopping. Our findings suggest that the IPS plays essential roles in executive functions.",Conditional Inactivation of Pen-2 in the Developing Neocortex Leads to Rapid Switch of Apical Progenitors to Basal Progenitors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30692224,The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,2019 04 18,"The transition of apical progenitors (APs) to basal progenitors (BPs) is an important neurogenic process during cortical expansion. Presenilin enhancer 2 (Pen-2, also named as Psenen) is a key subunit of γ-secretase and has been implicated in neurodevelopmental disease. However, it remains unknown how Pen-2 may regulate the maintenance of APs. To address this question, we generated a conditional KO (cKO) mouse in which Pen-2 is specifically inactivated in neural progenitor cells in the telencephalon. Both male and female embryos were used. We show that Pen-2 cKO cortices display remarkable depletion of Aps, but transient increase on BPs, compared with controls. We demonstrate that the proliferation rate of APs or BPs is not changed, but the switch of APs to BPs is dramatically accelerated in Pen-2 cKO cortices. Molecular analyses reveal decreased levels of Hes1 and Hes5 but increased levels of Ngn2 and NeuroD1 in Pen-2 KO cells. We report that expression of Notch1 intracellular domain in Pen-2 cKO cortices restores the population of APs and BPs. In summary, these findings highlight a central role of the Notch signaling in Pen-2-dependent maintenance of neural stem cells in the developing neocortex.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Presenilin enhancer 2 (Pen-2) has been implicated in neurodevelopmental disease. However, mechanisms by which Pen-2 regulates cortical development are not understood. In this study, we generated neural progenitor cell-specific Pen-2 conditional KO mice. We observe depletion of apical progenitors and transiently increased the number of basal progenitors in the developing neocortex of Pen-2 mutant mice. Mechanistic analyses reveal decreased levels of Hes1 and Hes5, but increased levels of neurogenic transcription factors in Pen-2 mutant cortices, compared with controls. We demonstrate that reintroduction of Notch intracellular domain into mutant mice restores the population of apical progenitors to basal progenitors. The above findings strongly suggest that the Pen-2-Notch pathway plays an essential role in the maintenance of neural stem cells during cortical development.",Anticipatory Neural Activity Improves the Decoding Accuracy for Dynamic Head-Direction Signals.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30692223,The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,2019 04 18,"Insects and vertebrates harbor specific neurons that encode the animal's head direction (HD) and provide an internal compass for spatial navigation. Each HD cell fires most strongly in one preferred direction. As the animal turns its head, however, HD cells in rat anterodorsal thalamic nucleus (ADN) and other brain areas fire already before their preferred direction is reached, as if the neurons anticipated the future HD. This phenomenon has been explained at a mechanistic level, but a functional interpretation is still missing. To close this gap, we use a computational approach based on the movement statistics of male rats and a simple model for the neural responses within the ADN HD network. Network activity is read out using population vectors in a biologically plausible manner, so that only past spikes are taken into account. We find that anticipatory firing improves the representation of the present HD by reducing the motion-induced temporal bias inherent in causal decoding. The amount of anticipation observed in ADN enhances the precision of the HD compass read-out by up to 40%. More generally, our theoretical framework predicts that neural integration times not only reflect biophysical constraints, but also the statistics of behaviorally relevant stimuli; in particular, anticipatory tuning should be found wherever neurons encode sensory signals that change gradually in time.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Across different brain regions, populations of noisy neurons encode dynamically changing stimuli. Decoding a time-varying stimulus from the population response involves a trade-off: For short read-out times, stimulus estimates are unreliable as the number of stochastic spikes is small; for long read-outs, estimates are biased because they lag behind the true stimulus. We show that optimal decoding of temporally correlated stimuli not only relies on finding the right read-out time window but requires neurons to anticipate future stimulus values. We apply this general framework to the rodent head-direction system and show that the experimentally observed anticipation of future head directions can be explained at a quantitative level from the neuronal tuning properties, network size, and the animal's head-movement statistics.",Lactate Mediates the Effects of Exercise on Learning and Memory through SIRT1-Dependent Activation of Hippocampal Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30692222,The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,2019 04 18,"Exercise promotes learning and memory formation. These effects depend on increases in hippocampal BDNF, a growth factor associated with cognitive improvement and the alleviation of depression symptoms. Identifying molecules that are produced during exercise and that mediate hippocampal Bdnf expression will allow us to harness the therapeutic potential of exercise. Here, we report that an endogenous molecule produced during exercise in male mice induces the Mus musculus Bdnf gene and promotes learning and memory formation. The metabolite lactate, which is released during exercise by the muscles, crosses the blood-brain barrier and induces Bdnf expression and TRKB signaling in the hippocampus. Indeed, we find that lactate-dependent increases in BDNF are associated with improved spatial learning and memory retention. The action of lactate is dependent on the activation of the Sirtuin1 deacetylase. SIRT1 increases the levels of the transcriptional coactivator PGC1a and the secreted molecule FNDC5, known to mediate Bdnf expression. These results reveal an endogenous mechanism to explain how physical exercise leads to the induction of BDNF, and identify lactate as a potential endogenous molecule that may have therapeutic value for CNS diseases in which BDNF signaling is disrupted.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT It is established that exercise promotes learning and memory formation and alleviates the symptoms of depression. These effects are mediated through inducing Bdnf expression and signaling in the hippocampus. Understanding how exercise induces Bdnf and identifying the molecules that mediate this induction will allow us to design therapeutic strategies that can mimic the effects of exercise on the brain, especially for patients with CNS disorders characterized by a decrease in Bdnf expression and who cannot exercise because of their conditions. We identify lactate as an endogenous metabolite that is produced during exercise, crosses the blood-brain barrier and promotes hippocampal dependent learning and memory in a BDNF-dependent manner. Our work identifies lactate as a component of the ""exercise pill.""",The Ciliopathy Gene Ftm/Rpgrip1l Controls Mouse Forebrain Patterning via Region-Specific Modulation of Hedgehog/Gli Signaling.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30692221,The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,2019 04 18,"Primary cilia are essential for CNS development. In the mouse, they play a critical role in patterning the spinal cord and telencephalon via the regulation of Hedgehog/Gli signaling. However, despite the frequent disruption of this signaling pathway in human forebrain malformations, the role of primary cilia in forebrain morphogenesis has been little investigated outside the telencephalon. Here we studied development of the diencephalon, hypothalamus and eyes in mutant mice in which the Ftm/Rpgrip1l ciliopathy gene is disrupted. At the end of gestation, Ftm-/- fetuses displayed anophthalmia, a reduction of the ventral hypothalamus and a disorganization of diencephalic nuclei and axonal tracts. In Ftm-/- embryos, we found that the ventral forebrain structures and the rostral thalamus were missing. Optic vesicles formed but lacked the optic cups. In Ftm-/- embryos, Sonic hedgehog (Shh) expression was virtually lost in the ventral forebrain but maintained in the zona limitans intrathalamica (ZLI), the mid-diencephalic organizer. Gli activity was severely downregulated but not lost in the ventral forebrain and in regions adjacent to the Shh-expressing ZLI. Reintroduction of the repressor form of Gli3 into the Ftm-/- background restored optic cup formation. Our data thus uncover a complex role of cilia in development of the diencephalon, hypothalamus and eyes via the region-specific control of the ratio of activator and repressor forms of the Gli transcription factors. They call for a closer examination of forebrain defects in severe ciliopathies and for a search for ciliopathy genes as modifiers in other human conditions with forebrain defects.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway is essential for proper forebrain development as illustrated by a human condition called holoprosencephaly. The Hh pathway relies on primary cilia, cellular organelles that receive and transduce extracellular signals and whose dysfunctions lead to rare inherited diseases called ciliopathies. To date, the role of cilia in the forebrain has been poorly studied outside the telencephalon. In this paper we study the role of the Ftm/Rpgrip1l ciliopathy gene in mouse forebrain development. We uncover complex functions of primary cilia in forebrain morphogenesis through region-specific modulation of the Hh pathway. Our data call for further examination of forebrain defects in ciliopathies and for a search for ciliopathy genes as modifiers in human conditions affecting forebrain development.",ROS1-Dependent DNA Demethylation Is Required for ABA-Inducible NIC3 Expression.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30692220,Plant physiology,2019 04 10,"DNA methylation plays an important role in diverse developmental processes in many eukaryotes, including the response to environmental stress. Abscisic acid (ABA) is a plant hormone that is up-regulated under stress. The involvement of DNA methylation in the ABA response has been reported but is poorly understood. DNA demethylation is a reverse process of DNA methylation and often induces structural changes of chromatin leading to transcriptional activation. In Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), active DNA demethylation depends on the activity of REPRESSOR OF SILENCING 1 (ROS1), which directly excises 5-methylcytosine from DNA. Here we showed that ros1 mutants were hypersensitive to ABA during early seedling development and root elongation. Expression levels of some ABA-inducible genes were decreased in ros1 mutants, and more than 60% of their proximal regions became hypermethylated, indicating that a subset of ABA-inducible genes are under the regulation of ROS1-dependent DNA demethylation. Notable among them is NICOTINAMIDASE 3 (NIC3) that encodes an enzyme that converts nicotinamide to nicotinic acid in the NAD+ salvage pathway. Many enzymes in this pathway are known to be involved in stress responses. The nic3 mutants display hypersensitivity to ABA, whereas overexpression of NIC3 restores normal ABA responses. Our data suggest that NIC3 is responsive to ABA but requires ROS1-mediated DNA demethylation at the promoter as a prerequisite to transcriptional activation. These findings suggest that ROS1-induced active DNA demethylation maintains the active state of NIC3 transcription in response to ABA.",Optical Properties of Corals Distort Variable Chlorophyll Fluorescence Measurements.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30692219,Plant physiology,2019 04 10,"Pulse-amplitude-modulated (PAM) fluorimetry is widely used in photobiological studies of corals, as it rapidly provides numerous photosynthetic parameters to assess coral ecophysiology. Coral optics studies have revealed the presence of light gradients in corals, which are strongly affected by light scattering in coral tissue and skeleton. We investigated whether coral optics affects variable chlorophyll (Chl) fluorescence measurements and derived photosynthetic parameters by developing planar hydrogel slabs with immobilized microalgae and with bulk optical properties similar to those of different types of corals. Our results show that PAM-based measurements of photosynthetic parameters differed substantially between hydrogels with different degrees of light scattering but identical microalgal density, yielding deviations in apparent maximal electron transport rates by a factor of 2. Furthermore, system settings such as the measuring light intensity affected F0, Fm , and Fv /Fm in hydrogels with identical light absorption but different degrees of light scattering. Likewise, differences in microalgal density affected variable Chl fluorescence parameters, where higher algal densities led to greater Fv /Fm values and relative electron transport rates. These results have important implications for the use of variable Chl fluorimetry in ecophysiological studies of coral stress and photosynthesis, as well as other optically dense systems such as plant tissue and biofilms.",Synthetic Switches and Regulatory Circuits in Plants.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30692218,Plant physiology,2019 06 04,"Synthetic biology is an established but ever-growing interdisciplinary field of research currently revolutionizing biomedicine studies and the biotech industry. The engineering of synthetic circuitry in bacterial, yeast, and animal systems prompted considerable advances for the understanding and manipulation of genetic and metabolic networks; however, their implementation in the plant field lags behind. Here, we review theoretical-experimental approaches to the engineering of synthetic chemical- and light-regulated (optogenetic) switches for the targeted interrogation and control of cellular processes, including existing applications in the plant field. We highlight the strategies for the modular assembly of genetic parts into synthetic circuits of different complexity, ranging from Boolean logic gates and oscillatory devices up to semi- and fully synthetic open- and closed-loop molecular and cellular circuits. Finally, we explore potential applications of these approaches for the engineering of novel functionalities in plants, including understanding complex signaling networks, improving crop productivity, and the production of biopharmaceuticals.",The Transcriptional Regulator Sin3A Contributes to the Oncogenic Potential of STAT3.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30692217,Cancer research,2019 06 15,"Epigenetic silencing of promoter and enhancer regions is a common phenomenon in malignant cells. The transcription factor STAT3 is aberrantly activated in several tumors, where its constitutive acetylation accounts for the transcriptional repression of a number of tumor suppressor genes (TSG) via molecular mechanisms that remain to be understood. Using nucleophosmin-anaplastic lymphoma kinase-positive (NPM-ALK+) anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (ALCL) as model system, we found in cells and patient-derived tumor xenografts that STAT3 is constitutively acetylated as a result of ALK activity. STAT3 acetylation relied on intact ALK-induced PI3K- and mTORC1-dependent signaling and was sensitive to resveratrol. Resveratrol lowered STAT3 acetylation, rescued TSG expression, and induced ALCL apoptotic cell death. STAT3 constitutively bound the Sin3A transcriptional repressor complex, and both STAT3 and Sin3A bound the promoter region of silenced TSG via a resveratrol-sensitive mechanism. Silencing SIN3A caused reexpression of TSG, induced ALCL apoptotic cell death in vitro, and hindered ALCL tumorigenic potential in vivo. A constitutive STAT3-Sin3A interaction was also found in breast adenocarcinoma cells and proved critical for TSG silencing and cell survival. Collectively, these results suggest that oncogene-driven STAT3 acetylation and its constitutive association with Sin3A represent novel and concomitant events contributing to STAT3 oncogenic potential. SIGNIFICANCE: This study delineates the transcriptional regulatory complex Sin3A as a mediator of STAT3 transcriptional repressor activity and identifies the STAT3/Sin3A axis as a druggable target to antagonize STAT3-addicted tumors.

We show that an increased nuclear pore density during OIS is responsible for SAHF formation. In particular, the nucleoporin TPR is necessary for both formation and maintenance of SAHFs. Loss of SAHFs does not affect cell cycle arrest but abrogates the senescence-associated secretory phenotype-a program of inflammatory cytokine gene activation. Our results uncover a previously unknown role of nuclear pores in heterochromatin reorganization in mammalian nuclei and demonstrate the importance of heterochromatin organization for a specific gene activation program.",A conserved CAF40-binding motif in metazoan NOT4 mediates association with the CCR4-NOT complex.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30692204,Genes & development,2019 04 02,"The multisubunit CCR4-NOT mRNA deadenylase complex plays important roles in the posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression. The NOT4 E3 ubiquitin ligase is a stable component of the CCR4-NOT complex in yeast but does not copurify with the human or Drosophila melanogaster complex. Here we show that the C-terminal regions of human and D. melanogaster NOT4 contain a conserved sequence motif that directly binds the CAF40 subunit of the CCR4-NOT complex (CAF40-binding motif [CBM]). In addition, nonconserved sequences flanking the CBM also contact other subunits of the complex. Crystal structures of the CBM-CAF40 complex reveal a mutually exclusive binding surface for NOT4 and Roquin or Bag of marbles mRNA regulatory proteins. Furthermore, CAF40 depletion or structure-guided mutagenesis to disrupt the NOT4-CAF40 interaction impairs the ability of NOT4 to elicit decay of tethered reporter mRNAs in cells. Together with additional sequence analyses, our results reveal the molecular basis for the association of metazoan NOT4 with the CCR4-NOT complex and show that it deviates substantially from yeast. They mark the NOT4 ubiquitin ligase as an ancient but nonconstitutive cofactor of the CCR4-NOT deadenylase with potential recruitment and/or effector functions.",Dppa2 and Dppa4 directly regulate the Dux-driven zygotic transcriptional program.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30692203,Genes & development,2019 03 01,"The molecular regulation of zygotic genome activation (ZGA) in mammals remains an exciting area of research. Primed mouse embryonic stem cells contain a rare subset of ""2C-like"" cells that are epigenetically and transcriptionally similar to the two-cell embryo and thus represent an in vitro approximation for studying ZGA transcription regulation. Recently, the transcription factor Dux, expressed in the minor wave of ZGA, was described to activate many downstream ZGA transcripts. However, it remains unknown what upstream maternal factors initiate ZGA in either a Dux-dependent or Dux-independent manner. Here we performed a candidate-based overexpression screen, identifying, among others, developmental pluripotency-associated 2 (Dppa2) and Dppa4 as positive regulators of 2C-like cells and transcription of ZGA genes. In the germline, promoter DNA demethylation coincides with expression of Dppa2 and Dppa4, which remain expressed until embryonic day 7.5 (E7.5), when their promoters are remethylated. Furthermore, Dppa2 and Dppa4 are also expressed during induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) reprogramming at the time that 2C-like transcription transiently peaks. Through a combination of overexpression, knockdown, knockout, and rescue experiments together with transcriptional analyses, we show that Dppa2 and Dppa4 directly regulate the 2C-like cell population and associated transcripts, including Dux and the Zscan4 cluster. Importantly, we teased apart the molecular hierarchy in which the 2C-like transcriptional program is initiated and stabilized. Dppa2 and Dppa4 require Dux to initiate 2C-like transcription, suggesting that they act upstream by directly regulating Dux. Supporting this, ChIP-seq (chromatin immunoprecipitation [ChIP] combined with high-throughput sequencing) analysis revealed that Dppa2 and Dppa4 bind to the Dux promoter and gene body and drive its expression. Zscan4c is also able to induce 2C-like cells in wild-type cells but, in contrast to Dux, can no longer do so in Dppa2/4 double-knockout cells, suggesting that it may act to stabilize rather than drive the transcriptional network. Our findings suggest a model in which Dppa2/4 binding to the Dux promoter leads to Dux up-regulation and activation of the 2C-like transcriptional program, which is subsequently reinforced by Zscan4c.",CD44 splice isoform switching determines breast cancer stem cell state.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30692202,Genes & development,2019 03 01,"Although changes in alternative splicing have been observed in cancer, their functional contributions still remain largely unclear. Here we report that splice isoforms of the cancer stem cell (CSC) marker CD44 exhibit strikingly opposite functions in breast cancer. Bioinformatic annotation in patient breast cancer in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database reveals that the CD44 standard splice isoform (CD44s) positively associates with the CSC gene signatures, whereas the CD44 variant splice isoforms (CD44v) exhibit an inverse association. We show that CD44s is the predominant isoform expressed in breast CSCs. Elimination of the CD44s isoform impairs CSC traits. Conversely, manipulating the splicing regulator ESRP1 to shift alternative splicing from CD44v to CD44s leads to an induction of CSC properties. We further demonstrate that CD44s activates the PDGFRβ/Stat3 cascade to promote CSC traits. These results reveal CD44 isoform specificity in CSC and non-CSC states and suggest that alternative splicing provides functional gene versatility that is essential for distinct cancer cell states and thus cancer phenotypes.",Synergy among non-desmoglein antibodies contributes to the immunopathology of desmoglein antibody-negative pemphigus vulgaris.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30692201,The Journal of biological chemistry,2019 03 29,"Pemphigus vulgaris (PV) is a potentially lethal mucocutaneous blistering disease characterized by IgG autoantibodies (AuAbs) binding to epidermal keratinocytes and inducing this devastating disease. Here, we observed that non-desmoglein (Dsg) AuAbs in the sera of patients with Dsg1/3 AuAb-negative acute PV are pathogenic, because IgGs from these individuals induced skin blistering in neonatal mice caused by suprabasal acantholysis. Serum levels of AuAbs to desmocollin 3 (Dsc3), M3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (M3AR), and secretory pathway Ca2+/Mn2+-ATPase isoform 1 (SPCA1) correlated with the disease stage of PV. Moreover, AuAb absorption on recombinant Dsc3, M3AR, or SPCA1 both prevented skin blistering in the passive transfer of AuAbs model of PV in BALB/c mice and significantly decreased the extent of acantholysis in a neonatal mouse skin explant model. Although acantholytic activities of each of these immunoaffinity-purified AuAbs could not induce a PV-like phenotype, their mixture produced a synergistic effect manifested by a positive Nikolskiy sign in the skin of neonatal mice. The downstream signaling of all pathogenic non-Dsg AuAbs involved p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-mediated phosphorylation and elevation of cytochrome c release and caspase 9 activity. Anti-Dsc3 and anti-SPCA1 AuAbs also activated SRC proto-oncogene, nonreceptor tyrosine kinase (SRC). Of note, although a constellation of non-Dsg AuAbs apparently disrupted epidermal integrity, elimination of a single pathogenic AuAb could prevent keratinocyte detachment and blistering. Therefore, anti-Dsg1/3 AuAb-free PV can be a model for elucidating the roles of non-Dsg antigen-specific AuAbs in the physiological regulation of keratinocyte cell-cell adhesion and blister development.",T cells transduce T-cell receptor signal strength by generating different phosphatidylinositols.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30692200,The Journal of biological chemistry,2019 04 04,"T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling strength is a dominant factor regulating T-cell differentiation, thymic development, and cytokine signaling. The molecular mechanisms by which TCR signal strength is transduced to downstream signaling networks remains ill-defined. Using computational modeling, biochemical assays, and imaging flow cytometry, we found here that TCR signal strength differentially generates phosphatidylinositol species. Weak TCR signals generated elevated phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) and reduced phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3) levels, whereas strong TCR signals reduced PI(4,5)P2 and elevated PIP3 levels. A proteomics screen revealed that focal adhesion kinase bound PI(4,5)P2, biochemical assays disclosed that focal adhesion kinase is preferentially activated by weak TCR signals and is required for optimal Treg induction, and further biochemical experiments revealed how TCR signaling strength regulates AKT activation. Low PIP3 levels generated by weak TCR signals were sufficient to activate phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 to phosphorylate AKT on Thr-308 but insufficient to activate mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2), whereas elevated PIP3 levels generated by a strong TCR signal were required to activate mTORC2 to phosphorylate Ser-473 on AKT. Our results provide support for a model that links TCR signaling to mTORC2 activation via phosphoinositide 3-kinase signaling. Together, the findings in this work establish that T cells measure TCR signal strength by generating different levels of phosphatidylinositol species that engage alternate signaling networks to control cell fate decisions.",Reduction of the expression of the late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk-factor BIN1 does not affect amyloid pathology in an AD mouse model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30692199,The Journal of biological chemistry,2019 03 29,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is pathologically characterized by the deposition of the β-amyloid (Aβ) peptide in senile plaques in the brain, leading to neuronal dysfunction and eventual decline in cognitive function.

BIN1 is a member of the amphiphysin family of proteins and has reported roles in the generation of membrane curvature and endocytosis. Endocytic dysfunction is a pathological feature of AD, and endocytosis of the amyloid precursor protein is an important step in its subsequent cleavage by β-secretase (BACE1). In vitro evidence implicates BIN1 in endosomal sorting of BACE1 and Aβ generation in neurons, but a role for BIN1 in this process in vivo is yet to be described. Here, using biochemical and immunohistochemistry analyses we report that a 50% global reduction of BIN1 protein levels resulting from a single Bin1 allele deletion in mice does not change BACE1 levels or localization in vivo, nor does this reduction alter the production of endogenous murine Aβ in nontransgenic mice. Furthermore, we found that reduction of BIN1 levels in the 5XFAD mouse model of amyloidosis does not alter Aβ deposition nor behavioral deficits associated with cerebral amyloid burden. Finally, a conditional BIN1 knockout in excitatory neurons did not alter BACE1, APP, C-terminal fragments derived from BACE1 cleavage of APP, or endogenous Aβ levels. These results indicate that BIN1 function does not regulate Aβ generation in vivo.","Lateral distribution of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate in membranes regulates formin- and ARP2/3-mediated actin nucleation.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30692198,The Journal of biological chemistry,2019 04 16,"Spatial and temporal control of actin polymerization is fundamental for many cellular processes, including cell migration, division, vesicle trafficking, and response to agonists. Many actin-regulatory proteins interact with phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) and are either activated or inactivated by local PI(4,5)P2 concentrations that form transiently at the cytoplasmic face of cell membranes. The molecular mechanisms of these interactions and how the dozens of PI(4,5)P2-sensitive actin-binding proteins are selectively recruited to membrane PI(4,5)P2 pools remains undefined. Using a combination of biochemical, imaging, and cell biologic studies, combined with molecular dynamics and analytical theory, we test the hypothesis that the lateral distribution of PI(4,5)P2 within lipid membranes and native plasma membranes alters the capacity of PI(4,5)P2 to nucleate actin assembly in brain and neutrophil extracts and show that activities of formins and the Arp2/3 complex respond to PI(4,5)P2 lateral distribution. Simulations and analytical theory show that cholesterol promotes the cooperative interaction of formins with multiple PI(4,5)P2 headgroups in the membrane to initiate actin nucleation. Masking PI(4,5)P2 with neomycin or disrupting PI(4,5)P2 domains in the plasma membrane by removing cholesterol decreases the ability of these membranes to nucleate actin assembly in cytoplasmic extracts.",Dynamic structural biology at the protein membrane interface.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30692197,The Journal of biological chemistry,2019 05 30,"Since I started doing scientific research, I've been fascinated by the interplay of protein structure and dynamics and how they together mediate protein function. A particular area of interest has been in understanding the mechanistic basis of how lipid-signaling enzymes function on membrane surfaces. In this award lecture article, I will describe my laboratory's studies on the structure and dynamics of lipid-signaling enzymes on membrane surfaces. This is important, as many lipid-signaling enzymes are regulated through dynamic regulatory mechanisms that control their enzymatic activity. This article will discuss my continued enthusiasm in using a synergistic application of hydrogen-deuterium exchange MS (HDX-MS) with other structural biology techniques to probe the mechanistic basis for how membrane-localized signaling enzymes are regulated and how these approaches can be used to understand how they are misregulated in disease. I will discuss specific examples of how we have used HDX-MS to study phosphoinositide kinases and the protein kinase Akt. An important focus will be on a description of how HDX-MS can be used as a powerful tool to optimize the design of constructs for X-ray crystallography and EM. The use of a diverse toolbox of biophysical methods has revealed novel insight into the complex and varied regulatory networks that control the function of lipid-signaling enzymes and enabled unique insight into the mechanics of membrane recruitment.",Protease domain and transmembrane domain of the type VII secretion mycosin protease determine system-specific functioning in mycobacteria.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30692196,The Journal of biological chemistry,2019 04 03,"Mycobacteria use type VII secretion systems to secrete proteins across their highly hydrophobic diderm cell envelope. Pathogenic mycobacteria, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium marinum, have up to five of these systems, named ESX-1 to ESX-5. Most of these systems contain a set of five conserved membrane components, of which the four Ecc proteins form the core membrane-embedded secretion complex. The fifth conserved membrane protein, mycosin protease (MycP), is not part of the core complex but is essential for secretion, as it stabilizes this membrane complex. Here we investigated which MycP domains are required for this stabilization by producing hybrid constructs between MycP1 and MycP5 in M. marinum and analyzed their effect on ESX-1 and ESX-5 secretion. We found that both the protease and transmembrane domain are required for the ESX system-specific function of mycosins. In addition, we observed that the transmembrane domain strongly affects MycP protein levels. We also show that the extended loops 1 and 2 in the protease domain are probably primarily involved in MycP stability, whereas loop 3 and the MycP5-specific loop 5 are dispensable. The atypical propeptide, or N-terminal extension, is required only for MycP stability. Finally, we show that the protease domain of MycPP1, encoded by the esx-P1 locus on the pRAW plasmid, is functionally redundant to the protease domain of MycP5 These results provide the first insight into the regions of mycosins involved in interaction with and stabilization of their respective ESX complexes."

In addition, strong interpersonal relationships are more likely to occur in individuals who possess a high level of emotional intelligence (EI). However, an examination of the impact of a clinical instructor's EI on CTE has not been extensively investigated. The aims of this study were to measure the CTE and EI of dental hygiene clinical instructors and to identify any correlations between their CTE and EI. In this cross-sectional quantitative study conducted in 2017, dental hygiene clinical instructors in selected U.S. dental hygiene programs were invited to complete two online assessments: the Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test (MSCEIT) and the Nursing Clinical Teaching Effectiveness Inventory (NCTEI). Demographic data collected from participants was also included in the exploratory data analysis. A total of 42 clinical instructors from programs in 19 states completed both the MSCEIT and the NCTEI. The results showed statistically significant correlations between negative clinical teaching behaviors and MSCEIT outcomes. These results suggest that emotional intelligence may be linked to dental hygiene clinical instructors' teaching effectiveness, with low emotional intelligence being a predictor of negative teaching behaviors.",Creating a Supportive Educational Research Culture at a Dental School by Identifying Obstacles and Solutions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30692184,Journal of dental education,2019 03 14,"The aim of this study was to identify the extent of educational research conducted at one U.S. dental school and to assess faculty needs for engaging in it more fully. A task force developed and administered a survey to all the school's full-time faculty members in January 2014. The response rate was 73.6% (n=106/144). The majority of the respondents were clinicians (73%), had a primary responsibility for teaching (80%), and were non-tenure track (62%). Thirty-six percent (n=24) of the non-tenure-track respondents reported being expected to engage in scholarship as well as the 38% (n=40) who were on the tenure track, for a total of 60% (n=64/106). Overall, 51% of respondents reported they had a half-day or less for scholarship. Clinical faculty respondents had significantly less time for scholarship than non-clinical (p<0.001). Two-thirds (n=72, 68%) said they had not received research training, and over half (n=56, 53%) had never conducted educational research. The most common answers for why respondents did not conduct educational research were ""do not know how"" (n=32%) and ""not required"" (n=23%). Help with statistical analysis was reported as the most important support factor, followed by having collaborators, help with research design, time, funding, and travel. While overall interest in conducting educational research was moderate (median=5 on a 1-10 scale, IQR=3,8), a highly interested group (n=45) had produced more research than others (p≤0.041). This group desired more small grants (91%) and training opportunities (89%, p≤0.001). In response to one of the findings of this study, a small-grant program of $15,000 annually for educational research was implemented in May 2014. Funded by this program, 11 projects have been initiated with both scholarship and learning improvement outcomes.",Improving Diversity of Dental Students Through the Boston University Master's of Oral Health Sciences Postbaccalaureate Program.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30692183,Journal of dental education,2019 03 14,"Boston University Goldman School of Dental Medicine (GSDM), in collaboration with Boston University School of Medicine, introduced the Oral Health Sciences (OHS) pipeline program in 2005 to enhance the academic preparedness of students from underrepresented minority (URM) groups for dental school admission. The aim of this study was to evaluate the OHS program's success in preparing URM students for dental school, as measured by acceptance to dental school and performance in the first and second years. Data on 2005-15 program enrollees were collected from admissions records, the registrar, and the Office of Institutional Research on students' race/ethnicity, undergraduate and OHS grade point average (GPA), and Dental Admission Test (DAT) scores. Acceptance to dental school and performance at GSDM for non-URM OHS graduates, URM OHS graduates, and non-OHS dental students were compared. A total of 55 URM students completed the OHS program during this period, with 49 successfully matriculating to a dental school in the U.S. and 33 attending GSDM. Average OHS GPA was higher for those URM students accepted to dental school than for those who did not gain admission (3.36±0.30 vs. 2.94±0.19). Evaluation of the academic performance of URM OHS students in the first year (p=0.13) and second year (p=0.88) at GSDM showed that these students performed as well as the non-OHS and non-URM OHS students. These results demonstrate that the OHS master's program serves as a successful credential-enhancing program for dental school applicants, while also serving as a pipeline to increase the number of qualified applicants from URM groups.","Dental and Dental Hygiene Students' Perceptions of Status Quo, Benefits of, and Curricular Suggestions for Shared Learning: On the Road to IPE?",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30692182,Journal of dental education,2019 03 14,"In 29 U.S. academic institutions, dental and dental hygiene students are educated on the same campus. The aims of this study were to explore the perceptions of dental and dental hygiene students on the same campus concerning the status quo of shared educational experiences, the benefits of shared education, and their curricular suggestions for shared education. Additionally, the study investigated whether the number of shared courses was correlated with the perceived benefits of shared learning. A survey was sent in 2016 to a chief administrator at all 29 dental school and dental hygiene programs that were on the same campus, with a request that the administrators forward the invitation email to all their students. A total of 375 dental and 117 dental hygiene students at 12 universities responded. The students reported that three of the nine dental hygiene programs and two of the six dental programs had no shared courses. The majority of dental/dental hygiene students agreed or agreed strongly that having joint classes would allow them to develop better relationships between dental and dental hygiene students (57%/57%) and gain a better understanding of each other's roles (50%/63%) and of what the other discipline ""is all about"" (54%/46%). Compared to dental hygiene students, dental students were less supportive of suggestions for curricular interventions such as partnering up in lab (on a five-point scale with 5=most positive: 3.99 vs. 3.56; p<0.001), using in-class time for shared group projects (3.83 vs. 3.27; p<0.001), and shadowing in clinics (4.26 vs. 3.16; p<0.001). The more courses dental and dental hygiene students jointly attended, the higher their percentage of clinic time spent on collaborative care (r=0.19; p<0.001). Having dental and dental hygiene programs on the same campus offers opportunities for shared learning, and this study's results suggest those opportunities may translate into increased shared learning.",Intracellular Degradation of Helicobacter pylori VacA Toxin as a Determinant of Gastric Epithelial Cell Viability.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30692181,Infection and immunity,2019 04 14,"Helicobacter pylori VacA is a secreted pore-forming toxin that induces cell vacuolation in vitro and contributes to the pathogenesis of gastric cancer and peptic ulcer disease. We observed that purified VacA has relatively little effect on the viability of AGS gastric epithelial cells, but the presence of exogenous weak bases such as ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) enhances the susceptibility of these cells to VacA-induced vacuolation and cell death. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that NH4Cl augments VacA toxicity by altering the intracellular trafficking of VacA or inhibiting intracellular VacA degradation. We observed VacA colocalization with LAMP1- and LC3-positive vesicles in both the presence and absence of NH4Cl, indicating that NH4Cl does not alter VacA trafficking to lysosomes or autophagosomes. Conversely, we found that supplemental NH4Cl significantly increases the intracellular stability of VacA. By conducting experiments using chemical inhibitors, stable ATG5 knockdown cell lines, and ATG16L1 knockout cells (generated using CRISPR/Cas9), we show that VacA degradation is independent of autophagy and proteasome activity but dependent on lysosomal acidification. We conclude that weak bases like ammonia, potentially generated during H. pylori infection by urease and other enzymes, enhance VacA toxicity by inhibiting toxin degradation.",Interaction of Gardnerella vaginalis and Vaginolysin with the Apical versus Basolateral Face of a Three-Dimensional Model of Vaginal Epithelium.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30692180,Infection and immunity,2019 04 14,"Studies have implicated Gardnerella vaginalis as an important etiological agent in bacterial vaginosis (BV). It produces a cholesterol-dependent cytolysin, vaginolysin (VLY). In this study, we sought to characterize the interaction between vaginal epithelium, G. vaginalis, and VLY using EpiVaginal tissues from MatTek. These tissues are three-dimensional and have distinct apical and basolateral sides, enabling comparison of the effects of G. vaginalis and VLY following exposure to either side. We measured cytotoxicity, cytokine production, and bacterial growth, following apical versus basolateral exposure. G. vaginalis exhibited more-rapid growth in coculture with the tissue model when it was exposed to the apical side. VLY permeabilized cells on the basolateral side of the tissues but failed to permeabilize apical epithelial cells. Cytokine secretion in response to VLY and G. vaginalis also depended on the polarity of exposure. VLY did not cause significant changes in cytokine levels when exposed apically. Apical tissue challenge by G. vaginalis appeared to dampen the inflammatory response, as decreases in granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) (6.6-fold), RANTES (14.8-fold), and interferon gamma inducible protein 10 kDa (IP-10) (53-fold) and an increase in interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) (5-fold) were observed. In vivo, G. vaginalis normally colonizes the apical face of the vaginal epithelium. Results from this study suggest that while G. vaginalis may grow on the apical face of the vaginal epithelium, its VLY toxin does not target these cells in this model. This phenomenon could have important implications regarding colonization of the vagina by G. vaginalis and may suggest an explanation for the lack of an overt immune response to this organism.",Staphylococcus aureus Biofilm-Conditioned Medium Impairs Macrophage-Mediated Antibiofilm Immune Response by Upregulating KLF2 Expression.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30692179,Infection and immunity,2019 04 14,"Staphylococcus aureus infections associated with the formation of biofilms on medical implants or host tissue play a critical role in the persistence of chronic infections. One critical mechanism of biofilm infection that leads to persistent infection lies in the capacity of biofilms to evade the macrophage-mediated innate immune response. It is now increasingly apparent that microorganisms exploit the negative regulatory mechanisms of the pattern recognition receptor (PRR)-mediated inflammatory response to subvert host cell functions by using various virulence factors. However, the detailed molecular mechanism, along with the identity of a target molecule, underlying the evasion of the macrophage-mediated innate immune response against S. aureus infection associated with biofilm formation remains to be elucidated. Here, using an in vitro culture model of murine macrophage-like RAW 264.7 cells, we demonstrate that S. aureus biofilm-conditioned medium significantly attenuated the capacity for macrophage bactericidal and proinflammatory responses. Importantly, the responses were associated with attenuated activation of NF-κB and increased expression of Kruppel-like factor 2 (KLF2) in RAW 264.7 cells. Small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated silencing of KLF2 in RAW 264.7 cells could restore the activation of NF-κB toward the bactericidal activity and generation of proinflammatory cytokines in the presence of S. aureus biofilm-conditioned medium. Collectively, our results suggest that factors secreted from S. aureus biofilms might exploit the KLF2-dependent negative regulatory mechanism to subvert macrophage-mediated innate immune defense against S. aureus biofilms.","Identification of a Conserved, Orphan G Protein-Coupled Receptor Required for Efficient Pathogen Clearance in Caenorhabditis elegans.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30692178,Infection and immunity,2019 04 14,"G protein-coupled receptors contribute to host defense across the animal kingdom, transducing many signals involved in both vertebrate and invertebrate immune responses. While it has become well established that the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans triggers innate immune responses following infection with numerous bacterial, fungal, and viral pathogens, the mechanisms by which C. elegans recognizes these pathogens have remained somewhat more elusive. C. elegans G protein-coupled receptors have been implicated in recognizing pathogen-associated damage and activating downstream host immune responses. Here we identify and characterize a novel G protein-coupled receptor required to regulate the C. elegans response to infection with Microbacterium nematophilum We show that this receptor, which we designate pathogen clearance-defective receptor 1 (PCDR-1), is required for efficient pathogen clearance following infection. PCDR-1 acts upstream of multiple G proteins, including the C. elegans Gαq ortholog, EGL-30, in rectal epithelial cells to promote pathogen clearance via a novel mechanism.",Identification of a Fifth Antibacterial Toxin Produced by a Single Bacteroides fragilis Strain.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30692177,Journal of bacteriology,2019 04 14,"Bacteroidales are the most abundant Gram-negative bacteria of the healthy human colonic microbiota, comprising nearly 50% of the colonic bacteria in many individuals. Numerous species and strains of gut Bacteroidales are present simultaneously at high concentrations in this ecosystem. Studies are revealing that gut Bacteroides has numerous antibacterial weapons to antagonize closely related members. In this study, we identify a new diffusible antibacterial toxin produced by Bacteroides fragilis 638R, designated BSAP-4. This is the fifth antibacterial toxin produced by this strain and the second toxin of this strain with a membrane attack complex/perforin domain (MACPF). We identify the target molecule of sensitive cells as a β-barrel outer membrane protein (OMP) with calycin-like domains. As with other MACPF toxins, the gene encoding the target in sensitive strains is in the same genetic region as bsap-4 in producing strains. A comparison of B. fragilis strains showed there are two sensitive variants of this OMP that are 87% similar to each other and 50% similar to the resistant OMP. Unlike other MACPF toxins, there are numerous B. fragilis strains that harbor the resistant OMP without bsap-4 Several OMP variants from strains that are BSAP-4 resistant under the conditions of our assay confer BSAP-4 sensitivity to Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron when constitutively expressed. Using a reporter assay, we show that the BSAP-4 receptor gene is differentially expressed in sensitive and resistant strains leading to apparent BSAP-4 resistance under the conditions of our assay, despite harboring the BSAP-4 target gene.IMPORTANCE The intestinal microbiota is a diverse microbial ecosystem that provides numerous benefits to humans. The factors that govern its establishment and stability are just beginning to be elucidated. Identification and characterization of antimicrobial toxins produced by its members and their killing range are essential to understanding the role of antagonism in community composition and stability. Here, we identify a fifth antimicrobial toxin produced by a single Bacteroides fragilis strain and identify its target. The finding of such a large number of toxins that antagonize competing members suggests that this feature substantially contributes to the fitness of these bacteria. In addition, these toxins may have applications in genetically engineered gut bacteria to allow engraftment or to antagonize a potentially pathogenic member.",Experimental Evolution of Extreme Resistance to Ionizing Radiation in Escherichia coli after 50 Cycles of Selection.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30692176,Journal of bacteriology,2019 04 14,"In previous work (D. R. Harris et al., J Bacteriol 191:5240-5252, 2009, https://doi.org/10.1128/JB.00502-09; B. T. Byrne et al., Elife 3:e01322, 2014, https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01322), we demonstrated that Escherichia coli could acquire substantial levels of resistance to ionizing radiation (IR) via directed evolution. Major phenotypic contributions involved adaptation of organic systems for DNA repair. We have now undertaken an extended effort to generate E. coli populations that are as resistant to IR as Deinococcus radiodurans After an initial 50 cycles of selection using high-energy electron beam IR, four replicate populations exhibit major increases in IR resistance but have not yet reached IR resistance equivalent to D. radiodurans Regular deep sequencing reveals complex evolutionary patterns with abundant clonal interference. Prominent IR resistance mechanisms involve novel adaptations to DNA repair systems and alterations in RNA polymerase. Adaptation is highly specialized to resist IR exposure, since isolates from the evolved populations exhibit highly variable patterns of resistance to other forms of DNA damage. Sequenced isolates from the populations possess between 184 and 280 mutations. IR resistance in one isolate, IR9-50-1, is derived largely from four novel mutations affecting DNA and RNA metabolism: RecD A90E, RecN K429Q, and RpoB S72N/RpoC K1172I. Additional mechanisms of IR resistance are evident.IMPORTANCE Some bacterial species exhibit astonishing resistance to ionizing radiation, with Deinococcus radiodurans being the archetype. As natural IR sources rarely exceed mGy levels, the capacity of Deinococcus to survive 5,000 Gy has been attributed to desiccation resistance. To understand the molecular basis of true extreme IR resistance, we are using experimental evolution to generate strains of Escherichia coli with IR resistance levels comparable to Deinococcus Experimental evolution has previously generated moderate radioresistance for multiple bacterial species. However, these efforts could not take advantage of modern genomic sequencing technologies. In this report, we examine four replicate bacterial populations after 50 selection cycles.

Prior steps included item generation, item reduction and hierarchical organisation of candidate criteria using an evidence-based approach. Our objectives were to determine relative weights using multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) and to set a provisional threshold score for SLE classification. An SLE Expert Panel (8 European, 9 North American) submitted 164 real, unique cases with a wide range of SLE probability in a standardised format. Using the candidate criteria, experts scored and rank-ordered 20 representative cases. At an in-person meeting, experts reviewed inter-rater reliability of scoring, further refined criteria definitions and participated in an MCDA exercise. Based on expert consensus decisions on pairwise comparisons of criteria, 1000minds software calculated criteria weights and rank-ordered the remaining 144 cases based on their additive scores. The score of the lowest-ranked case for which complete expert consensus was achieved defined the provisional threshold classification score. Inter-rater reliability of scoring cases with the candidate criteria was good. MCDA involved 74 pairwise decisions and was repeated for the arthritis and mucocutaneous domains when the initial ranking of some cases did not match expert opinion. After criteria weights and additive scores were recalculated once, experts reached consensus for SLE classification for all cases scoring>83. Using an iterative process, the candidate criteria definitions were refined, preliminary weights were calculated and a provisional threshold score for SLE classification was determined.","The people behind the papers - Masanori Kawaguchi, Kota Sugiyama and Yoshiyuki Seki.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30692163,"Development (Cambridge, England)",2019 01 29,"The molecular regulation of pluripotency has been most intensively studied in early mammalian development, but whether the transcriptional networks revealed in mouse and man also regulate pluripotency in other deuterostomes has remained unclear.

However, despite their relevance in replacing conventional desks, the comparison between types of active workstations and their respective benefits remains unclear. The purpose of this review article is thus to compare the benefits between standing, treadmill and cycling workstations. Search criteria explored Embase, PubMed and Web of Science databases. The review included studies concerning adults using at least two types of active workstations, evaluating biomechanical, physiological work performance and/or psychobiological outcomes. Twelve original articles were included. Treadmill workstations induced greater movement/activity and greater muscular activity in the upper limbs compared with standing workstations. Treadmill and cycling workstations resulted in elevated heart rate, decreased ambulatory blood pressure and increased energy expenditure during the workday compared with standing workstations. Treadmill workstations reduced fine motor skill function (ie, typing, mouse pointing and combined keyboard/mouse tasks) compared with cycling and standing workstations. Cycling workstations resulted in improved simple processing task speeds compared with standing and treadmill workstations. Treadmill and cycling workstations increased arousal and decreased boredom compared with standing workstations. The benefits associated with each type of active workstation (eg, standing, treadmill, cycling) may not be equivalent. Overall, cycling and treadmill workstations appear to provide greater short-term physiological changes than standing workstations that could potentially lead to better health. Cycling, treadmill and standing workstations appear to show short-term productivity benefits; however, treadmill workstations can reduce the performance of computer tasks.",Characteristics of short general internal medicine hospital stays: a multicentre cross-sectional study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30692151,CMAJ open,2019 02 19,"Short hospital stays may represent opportunities to avert unnecessary admissions or expedite inpatient care.

Sex differences in gene expression levels or in the structure of gene co-expression networks can cause sexual dimorphism and may resolve sexually antagonistic selection. Here we used RNA-sequencing in the salmonid Brook Charr Salvelinus fontinalis to characterize sex-specific co-expression networks in the liver of 47 female and 53 male offspring. In both networks, modules were characterized for functional enrichment, hub gene identification, and associations with 15 growth, reproduction, and stress-related phenotypes. Modules were then evaluated for preservation in the opposite sex, and in the congener Arctic Charr Salvelinus alpinus Overall, more transcripts were assigned to a module in the female network than in the male network, which coincided with higher inter-individual gene expression and phenotype variation in the females. Most modules were preserved between sexes and species, including those involved in conserved cellular processes (e.g., translation, immune pathways). However, two sex-specific male modules were identified, and these may contribute to sexual dimorphism. To compare with the network analysis, differentially expressed transcripts were identified between the sexes, revealing a total of 16% of expressed transcripts as sex-biased. For both sexes, there was no overrepresentation of sex-biased genes or sex-specific modules on the putative sex chromosome. Sex-biased transcripts were also not overrepresented in sex-specific modules, and in fact highly male-biased transcripts were enriched in preserved modules. Comparative network analysis and differential expression analyses identified different aspects of sex differences in gene expression, and both provided new insights on the genes underlying sexual dimorphism in the salmonid Brook Charr.",Economic crises and suicides between 1970 and 2011: time trend study in 21 developed countries.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30692149,Journal of epidemiology and community health,2019 03 09,Existing research on the relationship between economic recessions and suicides has almost completely concentrated on the most recent global financial crisis (2008).

Our recent study showed that MSCs may conduce to the ossification of spinal ligaments. Stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) and CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) regulate MSC migration. Moreover, their expression is elevated in sites of damage and remodeling in pathologic states. We explored the possible role of the SDF-1/CXCR4 axis in the chemotactic behavior of MSCs in the ossification of spinal ligaments. Specimens of thoracic vertebra ossified ligamentum flavum (OLF) and non-OLF plaques were received from patients in whom we had performed spine surgery. Paraffin-embedded tissue sections were prepared for immunohistochemical staining. Cultured MSCs from the ligamentum flavum were prepared for in vitro analyses. We observed SDF-1 and CXCR4 localization immunohistochemically in the perivascular area and collagenous matrix of ligaments and in chondrocytes near the ossification front of OLF. And then, immunohistochemical staining showed a close relationship between MSCs and the SDF-1/CXCR4 axis. In the in vitro analyses, expression of the SDF-1/CXCR4 and the migratory capacity of MSCs in OLF were remarkably higher compared with non-OLF MSCs. Furthermore, the migration of MSCs was upregulated by SDF-1 and downregulated by treatment with AMD3100 (C28H54N88HCl), a specific antagonist for CXCR4. All in vitro test data showed a significant difference in MSCs from OLF compared with non-OLF MSCs. Our results reveal that the SDF-1/CXCR4 axis may contribute to an MSC-mediated increase in the ossification process, indicating that the SDF-1/CXCR4 axis may become a potential target for a novel therapeutic strategy for ossification of spinal ligaments.",The circular RNome of primary breast cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30692147,Genome research,2019 06 13,"Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a class of RNAs that is under increasing scrutiny, although their functional roles are debated. We analyzed RNA-seq data of 348 primary breast cancers and developed a method to identify circRNAs that does not rely on unmapped reads or known splice junctions. We identified 95,843 circRNAs, of which 20,441 were found recurrently. Of the circRNAs that match exon boundaries of the same gene, 668 showed a poor or even negative (R < 0.2) correlation with the expression level of the linear gene. In silico analysis showed only a minority (8.5%) of circRNAs could be explained by known splicing events. Both these observations suggest that specific regulatory processes for circRNAs exist. We confirmed the presence of circRNAs of CNOT2, CREBBP, and RERE in an independent pool of primary breast cancers. We identified circRNA profiles associated with subgroups of breast cancers and with biological and clinical features, such as amount of tumor lymphocytic infiltrate and proliferation index. siRNA-mediated knockdown of circCNOT2 was shown to significantly reduce viability of the breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 and BT-474, further underlining the biological relevance of circRNAs. Furthermore, we found that circular, and not linear, CNOT2 levels are predictive for progression-free survival time to aromatase inhibitor (AI) therapy in advanced breast cancer patients, and found that circCNOT2 is detectable in cell-free RNA from plasma. We showed that circRNAs are abundantly present, show characteristics of being specifically regulated, are associated with clinical and biological properties, and thus are relevant in breast cancer.",Non-coding DNA in IBD: from sequence variation in DNA regulatory elements to novel therapeutic potential.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30692146,Gut,2019 04 26,"Genome-wide association studies have identified over 200 loci associated with IBD.

We discuss how epigenetic research can be used in candidate gene approaches that take non-coding variants into account and can help to pinpoint the essential pathways and cell types in the pathogenesis of IBD. Despite the increased level of genetic complexity, these findings can contribute to novel therapeutic options that target transcription factor binding and enhancer activity.

Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) is involved in the generation of NAD+ and a potential therapeutic target in AML. We evaluated the effect of KPT-9274, a p21-activated kinase 4/NAMPT inhibitor that possesses a unique NAMPT-binding profile based on in silico modeling compared with earlier compounds pursued against this target. KPT-9274 elicited loss of mitochondrial respiration and glycolysis and induced apoptosis in AML subtypes independent of mutations and genomic abnormalities. These actions occurred mainly through the depletion of NAD+, whereas genetic knockdown of p21-activated kinase 4 did not induce cytotoxicity in AML cell lines or influence the cytotoxic effect of KPT-9274. KPT-9274 exposure reduced colony formation, increased blast differentiation, and diminished the frequency of leukemia-initiating cells from primary AML samples; KPT-9274 was minimally cytotoxic toward normal hematopoietic or immune cells. In addition, KPT-9274 improved overall survival in vivo in 2 different mouse models of AML and reduced tumor development in a patient-derived xenograft model of AML.

DSH shows a mixture of pigmented and depigmented macules on the extremities. RAK shows reticulated, slightly depressed pigmented macules on the extremities. The causative gene of DSH was clarified as ADAR1 by positional cloning including linkage analysis and haplotype analysis in 2003. Ten years later, the causative gene of RAK was identified as ADAM10 by whole-exome sequencing, in 2013. ADAR1 is an RNA-editing enzyme which catalyzes the deamination of adenosine to inosine (A-to-I) in double-stranded RNA substrates during post-transcription processing. Inosine acts as guanine during translation, resulting in codon alterations or alternative splice sites that lead to functional changes in proteins when they occur in coding regions. In 2012, it was clarified that ADAR1 mutations cause Aicardi-Goutières syndrome 6, which is a severe genetic inflammatory disease that affects the brain and the skin. A zinc metalloprotease, a disintegrin and metalloprotease domain-containing protein 10 (ADAM10), is involved in the ectodomain shedding of various membrane proteins and shows various functions in vivo. ADAM10 is known to be involved in the ectodomain shedding of Notch proteins as substrates in the skin. We speculate that the pathogenesis of RAK and Dowling-Degos disease (DDD, a pigmentary disease similar to RAK) is associated with the Notch signaling pathway. In addition, ADAM10 mutations proved to be associated with late-onset Alzheimer disease. This review comprehensively discusses the updated pathophysiology of those genetic pigmentary disorders."

This enzyme catalyzes the first committed step of the non-mevalonate isoprenoid biosynthesis pathway, which is essential in Plasmodium falciparum and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Mainly as a result of its high polarity, fosmidomycin displays suboptimal pharmacokinetic properties. Furthermore, fosmidomycin is inactive against M. tuberculosis as a result of its inability to penetrate the bacterial cell wall. Temporarily masking the phosphonate moiety as a prodrug has the potential to solve both issues. We report the application of two amino acid based prodrug approaches on a fosmidomycin surrogate. Conversion of the phosphonate moiety into tyrosine-derived esters increases the in vitro activity against asexual blood stages of P. falciparum, while phosphonodiamidate prodrugs display promising antitubercular activities.

However, the comprehensive expression profile and competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) regulatory network between mRNAs and ncRNAs in the OS chemo-resistance still remain unclear. In the current study, we developed whole-transcriptome sequencing (RNA sequencing [RNA-seq]) in the three paired multi-drug chemo-resistant and chemo-sensitive OS cell lines to comprehensively identify differentially expressed lncRNAs, circRNAs, miRNAs, and mRNAs. Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses were performed for mRNAs with significantly different expression. Then the ceRNA networks combining lncRNAs, circRNAs, miRNAs, and mRNAs were predicted and constructed on the basis of the authoritative miRanda and TargetScan databases combined with the widely accepted vital drug resistance-related genes and signal transduction pathways. In addition, two constructed ceRNA regulatory pathways, lncRNAMEG3/hsa-miR-200b-3p/AKT2 and hsa_circ_0001258/hsa-miR-744-3p/GSTM2, were randomly selected and validated by real-time qPCR, RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP), RNA pull-down assay, and dual luciferase reporter gene system.

Strikingly, herds in the intervention group had a significantly higher prevalence of new intramammary infections compared with those in the control group. No significant differences were observed in the percentage of chronically infected cows, the bulk milk somatic cell count, and the bacterial and coliform count between the intervention and control herds, nor did the herd-level AMC differ between them. Furthermore, the level of mastitis management applied in each herd was assessed and scored [mastitis management score (MMS); higher is better], as was the level of implementation of different recommended mastitis management practices over time, expressed as the mastitis management implementation score (MMIS; higher is better). A large variation was observed in MMS and MMIS in the intervention herds (median = 16 and range = 12 to 22; median = 13 and range = -5 to 31, respectively) and the control herds (median = 16 and range = 9 to 22; median = 9 and range = -13 to 22, respectively). Also, intervention herds in which the herd veterinarian attended each herd visit executed by the first author had a higher MMS and MMIS (median = 20 and 24, respectively) compared with herds in which the veterinarian sometimes (median = 16 and 17, respectively) or never (median = 16.5 and 7.5, respectively) attended the herd visits. Further, the association between MMS or MMIS on one hand and udder health, milk quality, and the herd-level AMC over time on the other was studied using the data of both groups of herds. Better mastitis management was associated with a reduction in the consumption of antimicrobials that are critically important for human health over time and with lower bacterial counts and bulk milk somatic cell count. Better mastitis management can be helpful in obtaining better milk quality and more responsible use of critically important antimicrobials on dairy farms.",Oxylipid profiles of dairy cattle vary throughout the transition into early mammary gland involution.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30692004,Journal of dairy science,2019 04 10,"Successful lactation in multiparous dairy cattle relies on a well-managed dry period that allows the mammary gland to remodel and regenerate between lactations. Oxylipids are potent inflammatory mediators that are capable of regulating all aspects of inflammation. Although an oxylipid profile has been documented for periparturient and lactating cattle, little work has been done to define the profile of cows in the early dry period. Therefore, our group aimed to characterize the oxylipid profile in healthy cows during the transition into early mammary gland involution. Plasma samples were collected from 10 healthy Holstein dairy cows via coccygeal venipuncture 6 d before dry-off (d -6), at dry-off (d 0), and 1 (d +1), 2 (d +2), 6 (d +6), and 12 (d +12) d after the dry-off date. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry was used to quantify select monounsaturated fatty acids, polyunsaturated fatty acids, and saturated fatty acids, whereas oxylipids were quantified using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The results of this study revealed a unique profile of pro- and anti-inflammatory oxylipids throughout the transition from late lactation into the dry period. Many compounds reached the highest concentrations of the study at d +1, d +2, or d +12, whereas others reached the lowest concentrations at d +12. The characterization of this profile allows for further understanding of the physiology of early mammary involution. Future studies should investigate how the oxylipid profile of early mammary involution may affect the health and productivity of dairy cows.",Assessment of the bovine tuberculosis elimination protocol in the United States.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30692003,Journal of dairy science,2019 04 04,"In this study, we analyzed the performance of the USDA's bovine tuberculosis (bTB) elimination protocol in a 1,000-cow closed dairy herd using an agent-based simulation model under different levels of initial bTB infection. We followed the bTB test sensitivity and specificity values used by the USDA in its model assessment. We estimated the net present value over a 20-yr horizon for a bTB-free milking herd and for bTB-infected herds following the USDA protocol. We estimated the expected time to identify the infection in the herd once it is introduced, its elimination time, the reproductive number (R0), and effective reproduction number (Re) under the USDA protocol. The optimal number of consecutive negative whole-herd tests (WHT) needed to declare a herd bTB-free with a 95% confidence under different bTB prevalence levels was derived. Our results support the minimum number of consecutive negative WHT required by the USDA protocol to declare a herd bTB-free; however, the number of consecutive negative WHT needed to eliminate bTB in a herd depends on the sensitivity and specificity of the tests. The robustness of the protocol was analyzed under conservative bTB test parameters from the literature. The cost of implementing the USDA protocol when 1 infected heifer is introduced in a 1,000-cow dairy herd is about $1,523,161. The average time until detection and the time required to eliminate bTB-infected animals from the herd, after 1 occult animal is introduced in the herd, were 735 and 119 d, respectively.",Automated estrous detection using multiple commercial precision dairy monitoring technologies in synchronized dairy cows.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30692002,Journal of dairy science,2019 04 11,"Estrus in dairy cattle varies in duration and intensity, highlighting the need for accurate and continuous monitoring to determine optimal breeding time. The objective of this study was to evaluate precision dairy monitoring technologies (PDMT) for detecting estrus. Estrus was synchronized in lactating Holstein cows (n = 109) using a modified G7G-Ovsynch protocol (last GnRH injection withheld to permit expression of estrus) beginning at 45 to 85 d in milk. Resumption of ovarian cyclicity at enrollment was verified by transrectal ultrasonography for presence of a corpus luteum. Cows were observed visually during 30 min (4 times per day) for behavioral estrus on d -1 to 2 (d 0 = day of estrus). Periods peri-estrus were defined by the temporal blood plasma progesterone patterns on d -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8. Estrous detection by PDMT, an estrous behavior scoring system, and by visual observation of standing estrus were compared with the reference (gold) standard. Only 56% of cows that ovulated were observed standing by visual observation. Sensitivity and specificity for estrous detection were not different among all PDMT. Devices in this study measuring activity in steps, neck movement, high activity of head movement, or a proprietary motion index increased on the day of estrus 69 to 170% from the baseline before estrus. The change in rumination time on the day of estrus decreased for both neck and ear-based technologies (-2 to -16%). Temperature of the reticulorumen, vagina, and ear skin were not different on the day of estrus than day peri-estrus. Daily lying times decreased on average to 24.6% on the day of estrus for IceQube (IceRobotics Ltd., Edinburgh, Scotland). In contrast, lying time increased 15.5 and 33.1% for AfiAct Pedometer Plus (Afimilk, Kibbutz Afikim, Israel) and Track a Cow (ENGS Systems Innovative Dairy Solutions, Rosh Pina, Israel), respectively. All PDMT tested were capable of detecting estrus at least as effectively as visual observation. Four of the 6 PDMT that reported estrous alerts correctly detected 15 to 35% more cows than visual observation 4 times per day. Use of temporal progesterone patterns correctly identified more cows than visual observation alone. Dairy producers considering PDMT should focus on (1) the reference (gold) standard used to test efficacy of a device's alerts and (2) the device that will have the fewest false readings in their operations.","Linkage between predictive transmitting ability of a genetic index, potential milk production, and a dynamic model.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30692001,Journal of dairy science,2019 03 17,"With the increased use of information and communication technology-based tools and devices across traditional desktop computers and smartphones, models and decision-support systems are becoming more accessible for farmers to improve the decision-making process at the farm level. However, despite the focus of research and industry providers to develop tools that are easy to adopt by the end user, milk-production prediction models require substantial parameterization information for accurate milk production simulations. For these models to be useful at an individual animal level, they require the potential milk yield of the individual animals (and possibly potential fat and protein yields) to be captured and parameterized within the model to allow accurate simulations of the interaction of the animal with the system. The focus of this study was to link 3 predicted transmitting ability (PTA) traits from the Economic Breeding Index (PTA for milk yield, fat, and protein) with potential index parameters for milk, fat, and protein required as inputs to a herd-based dynamic milk model. We compiled a data set of 1,904 lactations that included different experiments conducted at 2 closed sites during a 14-yr period (2003-2016). The treatments implied different stocking rates, concentrate supplementation levels, calving dates, and genetic potential. The first step, using 75% of the data randomly selected, was to link the milk, fat, and protein yields achieved within each lactation to their respective PTA value, stocking rate, parity, and concentrate supplementation level. The equations generated were transformed to correspond to inputs to the pasture-based herd dynamic milk model. The equations created were used in conjunction with the model to predict milk, fat, and protein production. Then, using the remaining 25% data of the data set, the simulations were compared against the actual milk produced during the experiments. When the model was tested, it was capable of predicting the lactation milk, fat, and protein yield with a relative prediction error of <10% at the herd level and <13% at the individual animal level.",Milk yield and milking station visits of primiparous versus multiparous cows on automatic milking system farms in the Upper Midwest United States.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30692000,Journal of dairy science,2019 04 30,"The objective of this study was to investigate milk yield and frequency of visits to the milking station of primiparous versus multiparous cows at different stages of lactation on farms with automatic milking systems (AMS) in the Upper Midwest United States. Forty farms were included in the study, and daily AMS software data were collected for 18 mo. For the investigation of milk yield and milking visits, stage of lactation was categorized into 14 periods, 7 d in length for the first 28 d in milk (DIM) and 30 d in length thereafter until 328 DIM. Cow traffic flow to the AMS (free or guided) was included in the model. For the evaluation of failures and refusals, stage of lactation was categorized into 6 periods, 7 d in length each for the first 28 DIM, and 2 periods of 150 d in length each thereafter until 328 DIM. Failures are milking station visits where a cow fails to be milked due to lack of machine attachment although it is time for the cow to be milked. Refusals are milking station visits before adequate time has passed since previous milking, thus the cow leaves the milking station without being milked. Data from lactation days beyond 328 DIM were excluded from the study. Primiparous cows in free-flow systems produced less milk than multiparous cows until the 11th stage of lactation and produced more milk from the 12th stage until the end of the study period. Primiparous cows in guided-flow systems produced less milk than multiparous cows all 14 stages of lactation, but were approaching the milk yield of multiparous cows at the end of the study period. This was a biologically normal lactation curve for primiparous cows. However, estimated peak ratio (primiparous vs. multiparous cows' peak milk yield) was lower than industry standards. Both traffic flow systems had fewer milking visits for primiparous cows compared with multiparous cows in early lactation. This lower milking frequency persisted until the 11th stage of lactation in free-flow systems. In guided-flow systems, primiparous cows were milked less frequently until the 5th stage of lactation, had similar milking frequency in the 6th stage of lactation, and were milked more frequently thereafter. Failures were greater for primiparous cows during all stages of lactation. However, the greatest differences were detected in the early stages of lactation. Primiparous cows had 0.067 more failures/cow per day on average than multiparous cows during wk 1 of lactation. For the remaining lactation stages, differences in failures ranged from 0.003 to 0.039. Refusals were less frequent (0.4 to 0.6/d) for primiparous cows during the first 2 wk of lactation, similar for wk 3 of lactation, and more frequent for the remaining lactation stages (0.10 to 0.14/d). Failures and refusals were only evaluated in free-flow systems. These findings appear to indicate a potential lagging performance for primiparous cows in early lactation as compared with multiparous cows.

Increasing evidence suggests that the three class II PI3Ks isoforms (PI3K-C2α, PI3K-C2β, and PI3K-C2γ) have distinct and non-overlapping cellular roles. Here, we focus on the cellular functions of class II PI3Ks in different cell systems and underline the emerging importance of these enzymes in various physiological and pathological contexts.",Evolving Inversions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30691998,Trends in ecology & evolution,2019 06 13,"Empirical data suggest that inversions in many species contain genes important for intraspecific divergence and speciation, yet mechanisms of evolution remain unclear. While genes inside an inversion are tightly linked, inversions are not static but evolve separately from the rest of the genome by new mutations, recombination within arrangements, and gene flux between arrangements. Inversion polymorphisms are maintained by different processes, for example, divergent or balancing selection, or a mix of multiple processes. Moreover, the relative roles of selection, drift, mutation, and recombination will change over the lifetime of an inversion and within its area of distribution. We believe inversions are central to the evolution of many species, but we need many more data and new models to understand the complex mechanisms involved.",Risk factors for postoperative pain in the first three weeks after arthroscopic or open shoulder surgery.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30691997,"Orthopaedics & traumatology, surgery & research : OTSR",2019 04 02,Shoulder surgery is a painful procedure.

It was found that phosphorous and resistant starch content was generally increased by increasing the cross-linker concentration, pH and application of sonication. The damage to the surface of sonicated granules was revealed by scanning electron micrographs. The presence of cross-linked phosphorous groups was demonstrated by FT-IR results through the appearance of a new peak at wave numbers of 1248-1252 cm-1 that was more conspicuous in sonicated cross-linked samples. Sonicated cross-linked starches showed higher gelatinization temperatures and lower degrees of crystallinity, while no changes was detected in terms of A-type crystalline pattern. The development of viscosity was diminished prominently by the extreme cross-linking reactions in both sonicated and conventional cross-linked starches. The least glycemic index value was obtained for sonicated cross-linked starches which was negatively correlated to their higher RS content measured in-vitro. These results provide novel information on the preparation of cross-linked resistant starch under sonication conditions."

We have shown that vaccinating pregnant mares against the conserved surface polysaccharide capsule, β-1 → 6-linked poly-N-acetyl glucosamine (PNAG), elicits opsonic killing antibody that transfers via colostrum to foals and protects them against experimental infection with virulent. R. equi. We hypothesized that equine IgG1 might be more important than IgG4/7 for mediating protection against R. equi infection in foals. To test this hypothesis, we compared complement component 1 (C1) deposition and polymorphonuclear cell-mediated opsonophagocytic killing (OPK) mediated by IgG1 or IgG4/7 enriched from either PNAG hyperimmune plasma (HIP) or standard plasma. Subclasses IgG1 and IgG4/7 from PNAG HIP and standard plasma were precipitated onto a diethylaminoethyl ion exchange column, then further enriched using a protein G Sepharose column. We determined C1 deposition by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and estimated OPK by quantitative microbiologic culture. Anti-PNAG IgG1 deposited significantly (P < 0.05) more C1 onto PNAG than did IgG4/7 from PNAG HIP or subclasses IgG1 and IgG4/7 from standard plasma. In addition, IgG1 from PNAG HIP mediated significantly (P < 0.05) greater OPK than IgG4/7 from PNAG HIP or IgG1 and IgG4/7 from standard plasma. Our findings indicate that anti-PNAG IgG1 is a correlate of protection against R. equi in foals, which has important implications for understanding the immunopathogenesis of R. equi pneumonia, and as a tool for assessing vaccine efficacy and effectiveness when challenge is not feasible.",Associations between population based voting trends during the 2016 US presidential election and adolescent vaccination rates.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30691983,Vaccine,2019 02 12,"Politics play a role in the dissemination of public health information, including immunization-related issues.

Treatment tends to be excessive for most people, but there is justified anxiety about reducing vaccine dosage and shortening regimens. Recently, World Health Organisation (WHO) recommended one week primary post-exposure intradermal regimens requiring 3 clinic visits, but these are unlikely to prove economical where rabies vaccination is most needed, in deprived rural areas of Africa and Asia. A highly immunogenic regimen involving two doses of intradermal vaccine given one week apart has advantages over other regimens. Anyone exposed to a possibly rabid animal would be given intradermal (ID) injections at 4 sites using a whole vial of vaccine. Those who had not been previously vaccinated would be given 2-site ID injections using half a vial one week later. Those who might be immunosuppressed could be given an optional single ID dose on day 28. The rationale for this regimen is discussed in the context of the recently revised WHO recommendations for rabies prophylaxis.",Heterosubtypic protection against avian influenza virus by live attenuated and chimeric norovirus P-particle-M2e vaccines in chickens.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30691981,Vaccine,2019 02 18,"Avian influenza in poultry continues to be a great concern worldwide, and the currently licensed inactivated influenza vaccines are not effective against the novel strains of influenza virus that continue to emerge in the field. This warrants the development of more broadly protective influenza vaccines or vaccination regimens. Live attenuated influenza vaccines (LAIVs) and subunit vaccines derived from viral peptides, such as the highly conserved ectodomain of influenza virus matrix protein 2 (M2e), can offer a more broadly reactive immune response. In chickens, we previously showed that a chimeric norovirus P particle containing M2e (M2eP) could provide partial but broad immunity, when administered as a standalone vaccine, and also enhanced the protective efficacy of inactivated vaccine when used in a combination regimen. We also demonstrated that a naturally-selected NS1-truncated H7N3 LAIV (pc4-LAIV) was highly efficacious against antigenically distant heterologous H7N2 low pathogenicity avian influenza virus challenge, especially when used as the priming vaccine in a prime-boost vaccination regimen. In this study, we investigated the cross-subtype protective efficacy of pc4-LAIV in conjunction with M2eP using single vaccination, combined treatment, and prime-boost approaches. Chickens vaccinated with pc4-LAIV showed significant reduction of tracheal shedding of a low pathogenicity H5N2 challenge virus. This cross-subtype protective efficacy was further enhanced, during the initial stages of challenge virus replication, in chickens that received a vaccination regimen consisting of priming with pc4-LAIV at 1 day of age and boosting with M2eP. Further, H5N2-specific serum IgG and pc4-LAIV-specific hemagglutination-inhibition antibody titers were enhanced in LAIV-primed and M2eP boost-vaccinated chickens. Taken together, our data point to the need of further investigation into the benefits of combined and prime-boost vaccination schemes utilizing LAIV and epitope-based vaccines, to develop more broadly protective vaccination regimens.",Antibody persistence and booster response in adolescents and young adults 4 and 7.5 years after immunization with 4CMenB vaccine.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30691980,Vaccine,2019 02 12,"Data on duration of protection against invasive meningococcal disease post-vaccination with the recombinant, 4-component, meningococcal serogroup B vaccine (4CMenB) are limited.

The activation rate is set by extremely rare events, which have drastically different time scales from the mean times between activations, and depends on different structural parameters. This shift calls for reconsideration of physical processes used in deterministic and stochastic modeling of chemical reactions that are based on the traditional forward rate, especially for fast activation processes in living cells. Consequently, the biological activation time is not necessarily exponentially distributed. We review here the physical models, the mathematical analysis and the new paradigm of setting the scale to be the shortest time for activation that clarifies the role of population redundancy in selecting and accelerating transient cellular search processes. We provide examples in cellular transduction, gene activation, cell senescence activation or spermatozoa selection during fertilization, where the rate depends on numbers.

A systematic review evaluated studies that linked distress tolerance to smoking. Central findings suggest that (a) distress tolerance can-but does not always-predict smoking cessation lapse, (b) treatments targeting distress tolerance are promising but need additional research, (c) lower distress tolerance does not seem to be associated with greater smoking frequency or longevity, and (d) limited work evaluates the effect of smoking context on distress tolerance. Gaps in our current knowledge are also identified, most notably the need to evaluate how links between distress tolerance and smoking develop across smoking escalation and maintenance stages, and the need to examine distress tolerance contextually. A model of momentary distress tolerance is proposed, where the key premise is to discuss the factors which could influence state or momentary distress tolerance and how habitual smoking may lower distress tolerance and reinforce the links between heightened distress and smoking behavior. Theoretical and measurement implications are discussed with the aim of extending future research on distress tolerance and smoking.","Perioperative, oncological and functional outcomes after robotic partial nephrectomy vs. cryoablation in the elderly: A propensity score matched analysis.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30691958,Urologic oncology,2019 03 29,"To compare perioperative, oncological and functional outcomes of robotic partial nephrectomy (RPN) versus cryoablation in elderly patients (>75 years old), accounting for patient's and tumor's related factors.",Effect of histopathologic characteristics on pseudocapsular invasion in the case of partial nephrectomy for renal tumours.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30691956,Asian journal of surgery,2019 03 06,"It is aimed to define the existence of pseudocapsular structure on renal tumours, illuminate the relation between pseudocapsular invasion and Fuhrman grade histological type that are among histopathologic prognostic risk factors and determine the relation between surgical margin positivity and existence of pseudocapsular invasion.

Here, we present biochemical, functional, and natural history data from 50 individuals homozygous for a pathogenic ST3GAL5 c.862C>T founder allele (median age 8.1, range 0.7-30.5 years). GM3 and its derivatives were undetectable in plasma. Weight and head circumference were normal at birth and mean Apgar scores were 7.7 ± 2.0 (1 min) and 8.9 ± 0.5 (5 min). Somatic growth failure, progressive microcephaly, global developmental delay, visual inattentiveness, and dyskinetic movements developed within a few months of life. Infantile-onset epileptic encephalopathy was characterized by a slow, disorganized, high-voltage background, poor state transitions, absent posterior rhythm, and spike trains from multiple independent cortical foci; >90% of electrographic seizures were clinically silent. Hearing loss affected cochlea and central auditory pathways and 76% of children tested failed the newborn hearing screen. Development stagnated early in life; only 13 (26%) patients sat independently (median age 30 months), three (6%) learned to crawl, and none achieved reciprocal communication. Incessant irritability, often accompanied by insomnia, began during infancy and contributed to high parental stress. Despite catastrophic neurological dysfunction, neuroimaging showed only subtle or no destructive changes into late childhood and hospitalizations were surprisingly rare (0.2 per patient per year).

TRPS dental phenotypes suggest that TRPS1 regulates multiple aspects of odontogenesis, including the tooth number and size. Previous studies delineating Trps1 expression throughout embryonic tooth development in mice detected strong Trps1 expression in dental mesenchyme, preodontoblasts, and dental follicles, suggesting that TRPS dental phenotypes result from abnormalities in early developmental processes. In this study, Trps1+/- and Trps1-/- mice were analyzed to determine consequences of Trps1 deficiency on odontogenesis. We focused on the aspects of tooth formation that are disturbed in TRPS and on potential molecular abnormalities underlying TRPS dental phenotypes. Microcomputed tomography analyses of molars were used to determine tooth size, crown shape, and mineralization of dental tissues. These analyses uncovered that disruption of one Trps1 allele is sufficient to impair mineralization of dentin in both male and female mice. Enamel mineral density was decreased only in males, while mineralization of the root dental tissues was decreased only in females. In addition, significantly smaller teeth were detected in Trps1+/- females. Histomorphometric analyses of tooth organs showed reduced anterior-posterior diameter in Trps1-/- mice. BrdU-incorporation assay detected reduced proliferation of mesenchymal and epithelial cells in Trps1-/- tooth organs. Immunohistochemistry for Runx2 and Osx osteogenic transcription factors revealed changes in their spatial distribution in Trps1-/- tooth organs and uncovered cell-type specific requirements of Trps1 for Osx expression. In conclusion, this study has demonstrated that Trps1 is a positive regulator of cell proliferation in both dental mesenchyme and epithelium, suggesting that the microdontia in TRPS is likely due to decreased cell proliferation in developing tooth organs. Furthermore, the reduced mineralization observed in Trps1+/- mice may provide some explanation for the extensive dental caries reported in TRPS patients.","Choice of three different intramedullary nails in the treatment of trochanteric fractures: Outcome, analysis and consideration in midterm.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30691924,Injury,2019 01 29,"The purpose of this study is to compare the results obtained using three different systems of osteosynthesis, developed for the surgical treatment of fractures of the trochanteric region of the femur, based on the principle intramedullary nailing: the Gamma nail, the Affixus nail and the ZNN nail. This is a retrospective study: 72 trochanteric fractures treated with the Gamma nail, 68 treated with the Affixus nail and 69 treated with the ZNN nail, between the years 2012 and 2014, with the prerequisite of a minimum follow-up of 18 months. The fractures were classified according to the AO system; the most commonly reported subtype was the A2 fracture. Clinical and radiographic examinations were performed, both at hospital admission and post-operatively, at 1, 3, 6, 12 and 18 months. Of the 209 patients, 171 were women and 38 were men. The average age was 83.12 years old. All three systems guaranteed an early mobilization and ambulation in most of the patients. There were no significant differences in the use of the three nails in terms of recovery of previous functional capacity, or in terms of the time required for the fracture to heal. There were no advantages encountered with the use of one intramedullary nail over another and, in particular, when observing the complications and patient outcome, there were no statistically significant differences detected."

Irrigation with poor quality water and indiscriminate use of chemical fertilizers to increase crop productivity creates salt accumulation in soil profile thereby reducing crop sustainability. High concentration of salts in soil inhibits plant growth due to low osmotic potential of the soil solution, ion toxicity and imbalance reduces nutrient uptake, crop yields. Low productivity of saline soils is not only due to salt toxicity or excess amounts of soluble salts but also lack of available mineral nutrients especially nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and soil organic matter. Hence, sustainable management of salt-affected soils are paramount importance to meet the demands of food grain production for an ever-rising population in the world. Recently, municipal solid waste has gained importance as an organic amendment for restoring soil fertility and finally contributing to productivity of salt-affected soils. This paper compares extant waste generation, their properties and standards pertinent to municipal solid waste in different countries and explores the unique recent history in some countries that shows high environmental regard and rapid changes and also suggests policy experiencing from high environmental regard and rapid changes from other countries, so that policy makers can propose new or revise current municipal solid waste standards for salt affected soils. Municipal solid waste compost improves soil biological, physical and chemical properties because of high soil organic matter and lower concentration of pollutants. Therefore, the use of municipal solid waste in salt-affected soils could be an alternative to costly chemical amendments as well as reduce the reliance on chemical fertilizers for increasing productivity of salt-affected soil. The municipal solid wastes significantly improve crop yields. However, further long-term experimental investigations are needed to re-validate the application of municipal solid waste compost in improving physical, chemical and biological properties and to step up organic fertilization use in a wide range of both saline and sodic soils. In future, research should be directed to address these issues globally to minimise ecological disturbances and to set environmental standards, and evaluate the feasibility of the policies in different countries and their impact on socio-economic conditions of local people.",Effect of biochar addition on the OFMSW composting process under real conditions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30691911,"Waste management (New York, N.Y.)",2019 01 29,"The article evaluates the effect of small selected doses of biochar addition (0%, 1.5%, 3% and 5%, wet weight) on the composting process of the organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW) with a low initial C/N ratio under real conditions. The low C/N composting mixtures with addition of biochar at low rates can have a positive effect on the compost quality and on the reduction of N losses in compost. The novelty of this work consists in studying the impact of small biochar doses on the composting process at full-scale. The research was conducted under real conditions in the Brno Central Composting Plant (Czech Republic) receiving food waste, grass, straw, sawdust, mineral waste, paper, wood and sewage sludge for processing. The experimental processing time was 12 weeks. We evaluated changes in carbon (C), nitrogen (N), moisture content (MC), organic matter (OM), respiration activity (AT4), as well as changes in the microbiocenotic composition of microorganisms colonizing the processed waste. OFMSW with the addition of biochar and compost were assessed for the content of heavy metals (HM). It was found out that biochar reduced the compost toxicity. The resulting compost with the addition of biochar exhibited higher moisture content and lower waste density. Biochar had an impact on N retention during composting but it did not change the course or accelerate the composting process. The highest OM loss (62.6%) was observed in the OFMSW with no biochar addition. The abundance of potentially pathogenic microorganisms clearly decreased during the OFMSW composting process with the addition of biochar.",Effects of particle size on properties and thermal inertization of bottom ashes (MSW of Turin's incinerator).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30691909,"Waste management (New York, N.Y.)",2019 01 29,"The aim of this study is twofold: (i) characterization of the bottom ashes from the Incinerator plant of the city of Turin (northern Italy), in terms of their chemical/phase compositions and capacity to release heavy metals in leachates, as a function of particle size; (ii) investigation of thermal treatments' efficacy to promote inertization of the same bottom ashes, exploring time-temperature ranges with t ≤ 6 h and T ≤ 1000 °C. Special attention is paid to macro-sampling techniques in order to have samples that are representative of the average bottom ashes production. Micro-XRF, ICP-OES, SEM-EDS, Ion Chromatography and X-ray powder diffraction were used to investigate bottom ashes and leachates. Bottom ashes are mainly constituted by an amorphous phase, ∼66-97 wt%, regardless of particle size; the remaining phases are quartz, calcite, Fe-oxides, melilite and other minor crystalline materials. The amorphous phase exhibits a relevant dependence on particle size, and undergoes dissolution in water up to 20 wt%, thus being the most important component in affecting chemical species release. The smaller the bottom ashes' particle size, the more the heavy metals (major species: Zn, Cu, Ti, Pb) and calcium contents increase, whereas silicon's decreases. Electrolytic current observations in combination with phase/chemical composition and metals release as a function of particle size, suggest that bottom ashes partition into two classes, i.e. ≥1 and <1 mm, for inertization purposes. Thermal treatments exhibit partial efficacy to curb heavy metals mobility: whilst they reduce Cu release, they lead to a inverse effect in the case of Cr.",Comprehension of heavy metal stability in municipal solid waste incineration fly ash with its compositional variety: A quick prediction case of leaching potential.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30691908,"Waste management (New York, N.Y.)",2019 01 29,"In the current work, a quick prediction of the heavy metal (HM) leaching potential in municipal solid waste incineration fly ash (MSWI FA) was developed based on the statistical data between the HM leaching behaviors and the compositional variety in FA from China. In the comparison of the surveyed (508 data points) leaching concentrations, Pb and Cd leaching amounts in FA exceeded the Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP) limits most frequently. Moreover, the chemical compositions (pH and soluble chlorine (S-Cl)) of FA were proposed to have significant linear correlations with the Pb and Cd leaching. This corresponded to the chemical fraction change of the HM (risk assessment code (RAC)), which was relative to the pH of FA and chloride. This suggests that the HM stability can be evaluated by these factors. To verify this hypothesis, principal component analysis (PCA) and multiple linear regressions were used to evaluate the relationship between 5 indices and the leaching concentrations of Pb and Cd in 160 MSWI FA samples after stabilization/solidification from eastern China. It is indicated that pH, S-Cl and free CaO were the critical variables in Pb and Cd leaching. Accordingly, a new index, Φ, combined with the logistic model was proposed to predict the leaching potential. It is revealed that the high risk of the exceeding the limits for HM leaching occurred when Φ was below 12.5. Our results assess the HM stability in MSWI FA with its compositional variety in a statistical way, which gives an approach for the quick prediction of HM leaching potential.","Plastic bag use in South Africa: Perceptions, practices and potential intervention strategies.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30691907,"Waste management (New York, N.Y.)",2019 01 29,"Single-use plastic shopping bag consumption is one of the leading causes of environmental and socio-economic problems worldwide, which has led to global calls for intervention strategies to reduce use. In South Africa, plastic bag use is still widespread despite intervention efforts based on levying taxes. Using an online questionnaire, this study examines plastic bag use practices and factors influencing use in South Africa. The results show that the majority of respondents perceived there was a plastic bag use problem in the country but still highly used plastic bags because it was convenient to do so. Factors like, gender, age, education and environmental consciousness influenced people's willingness to pay for plastic bags but the relationships were generally weak.

New evidence from spatial linkage analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30691906,"Waste management (New York, N.Y.)",2019 01 29,"Ever increasing municipal solid waste (MSW) is becoming a serious city pollution trouble, extensive studies explored this question from micro demographic factors before. But testing the impact of spatial dependence on MSW from macroeconomic factors with city-level panel data has not received adequate attention it deserves in prior literature, and routinely ignoring spatial dependence is prone to estimation biases. This research utilizes panel data of 285 Chinese cities for the period of 2006-2015 to explore the spatial dependence of the MSW. Employing two elaborate spatial panel models, the empirical result indicates that while road length, tertiary proportion, urbanization rate have significantly accelerated MSW generation, sanitation investment and education level are slightly negatively correlated with MSW generation, and GDP per capita has a mutual improvement relationship with MSW generation instead of inverted U-shape as predicted by Environmental Kuznets curve, which provides a new insight into city planning and environment protection when facing the fierce socio-environmental conflicts. Besides, there obviously exists spatial dependence and convergence phenomenon of MSW generation among China's cities.",CDDPath: A method for quantifying the loss and recovery of construction and demolition debris in the United States.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30691905,"Waste management (New York, N.Y.)",2019 04 16,"National generation estimates for seven material types in the construction and demolition debris stream are regularly published in the United States. However, the quantities of these materials in different end-of-life management pathways are not published or otherwise made available. Quantification of end-of-life management pathways is useful for identifying approaches to decrease disposal and increase material recovery. An issue for construction and demolition debris is that data needed for a nationwide estimate of management pathways are not tracked in a single system. We propose and outline a method that draws on a combination of data sources, including nationwide generation estimates, state data, industry association data, and recovery facility reports. Capturing the available data and using the proposed method, we can estimate what end-of-life pathways are used for the seven materials in the US Environmental Protection Agency's annual reports of CDD generation (steel, wood products, drywall and plaster, brick and clay tile, asphalt shingles, concrete and asphalt concrete), and five additional materials managed within the CDD waste stream (carpet, plastic, glass, cardboard and organics). Method results indicate that the vast majority of CDD concrete and asphalt pavement, which in 2014 constituted ∼78% of the overall mass of the stream's components, were reclaimed for use, primarily in road projects. A significant opportunity for material recovery still exists for the remaining ∼22% of the stream. In 2014, approximately 64% of these remaining materials in the US was ultimately routed for landfill disposal.",Treatment of landfill gas with low methane content by biocover systems.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30691904,"Waste management (New York, N.Y.)",2019 01 29,"Landfills are significant sources of anthropogenic atmospheric methane (CH4), which contributes to climate change. Large amounts of CH4 are emitted from landfills in dilute form due to mixing with air in leachate collection systems, or during lateral migration away from landfills. The objective of this study was to investigate the CH4 oxidation efficiency of a compost material subject to LFG diluted with atmospheric air resulting in CH4 concentrations of 5-10% v/v. CH4 oxidation rates and carbon dioxide (CO2) production were measured through batch and dynamic column experiments where two laboratory scale biofilters were constructed. The columns were run at increasing flow rates. Column gas concentration profiles for each of five flow campaigns were compared to each other. This showed that oxygen (O2) was present through the entire column and elevated CO2 concentrations throughout the biofilters were found. Moreover, the oxidation process tended to be centred in the lower parts of both columns. It was observed that the biofilters performed better once they had adapted to the increasing loads of CH4. In both columns, the maximum removal rate of CH4 was found to be 98-100%. Using CH4 mass balances the maximum oxidation rate was 238 g CH4 m-2 d-1 in Column 1 and 483 g CH4 m-2 d-1 in Column 2 (equal to the load). None of the biofilters reached their maximum CH4 oxidation capacity, hence they could have been exposed to a larger CH4 load. It was found that the retention time in the columns was not a factor limiting the oxidation process. High O2 consumption and carbon mass balances underlined the strong microbial activity in the biofilters and it was not suspected that the methane oxidising bacteria were O2 limited. The results of this study suggest that biofilters have great potential for reducing CH4 in diluted LFG.",Aluminum anodizing waste and its uses: An overview of potential applications and market opportunities.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30691903,"Waste management (New York, N.Y.)",2019 01 29,"The aluminum anodizing process generates a large volume of waste composed mainly of amorphous aluminum hydroxide with chemical compatibility to be used in other industrial processes as an alternative starting raw material. This waste has several application possibilities such as the production of refractories, ceramic pigments, bricks, and many others. However, despite its potential features, its recycling process is far from well consolidated. This work highlights the most important contributions regarding Al-anodizing waste (AAW) features and their potential applications from the last 30 years. We provide the most complete and detailed characterization of AAW including chemical, physical, thermal, and microstructural analysis. The characterization analyzes were performed in a Brazilian waste sample and were compared with AAW worldwide. Additionally, our characterization results also considered differentiate previous processing; this, it many other possibilities are suggested that have not been explored thus far. The recycling feasibility of AAW is discussed according to the following criteria: classification, including legislation and standards; potentiality, including physical and chemical characteristics and purity; quantity, including production data; viability, including availability, costs regarding disposal and recycling process, and available technology for recycling; and applicability, including market opportunities. Moreover, alumina recovery from AAW and the related environmental aspects are discussed.",Characterization of solid and vapor products from thermochemical conversion of municipal solid waste woody fractions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30691902,"Waste management (New York, N.Y.)",2019 01 29,"The ever-increasing consumption of material goods with economic growth is resulting in an increasing generation of municipal solid waste (MSW) and the rapid filling of landfills. Fractions of municipal solid waste containing wood-based products have the potential to be used for the development of value added products. In this paper we produced and characterized biochar and pyrolysis vapors from municipal solid waste (MSW) woody fractions to demonstrate their suitability towards soil amendments. Carbonization work focused on compost overs, molded wood pallets, treated wood, sawmill cut ends, wood derived fuels, furniture, painted wood, plywood, oriented strand board and particle boards from Washington State recycling facilities. The goal of this research is to use these biochars as soil amendments; however, there are concerns with both the potential presence of condensed organic pollutants and trace metals. The presence of trace metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) in all the biochars produced were examined. GC-MS analyses of liquid extracts did not reveal the presence of soluble PAH compounds. High concentrations of mercury (Hg) and arsenic (As) were found in the biochar made from painted wood and treated wood, respectively. Among the methods tested for the removal of trace metals, acid washing was found to be the most effective. The volatiles released from the analyzed MSW fractions were also analyzed in Py-GC-MS studies. Among these volatile compounds, many contained Cl, N, or S, which could be potential sources of pollution if the pyrolysis vapors are combusted."

ML surveys were conducted every season in a total of 8 beach monitoring sites during 2015-2016. Eight main categories of material were determined, based on standard OSPAR monitoring protocol. Annual accumulation of 19,805 nos. was recorded. The highest was the quantity of items related to artificial polymer materials category - 16,690 nos. The most dominant in this category were cigarette butts and filters - 4496 nos., followed by plastic caps/lids drinks - 1413 nos. and cups and cup lids - 1194 nos.

Black Soldier Fly (BSF) biowaste treatment is an attractive treatment option as it offers a solution for waste management while also providing a protein source to help alleviate the rising global demand for animal feed. However, to-date very little information is available on how this technology performs with regard to direct greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and global warming potential (GWP). This paper presents a study that uses a life cycle assessment (LCA) approach to assess the GWP of a BSF waste treatment facility in the case of Indonesia and compares it with respective values for an open windrow composting facility. Direct CH4 and N2O samples were extracted from BSF treatment units and analyzed by gas chromatography. Results show that direct CO2eq emissions are 47 times lower the emissions from composting. Regarding the overall GWP, the LCA shows that composting has double the GWP of BSF treatment facility based on the functional unit of 1 ton of biowaste (wet weight). The main GWP contribution from a BSF facility are from: (1) residue post-composting (69%) and (2) electricity needs and source (up to 55%). Fishmeal production substitution by BSF larvae meal can reduce significantly the GWP (up to 30%). Based on this study, we conclude that BSF biowaste treatment offers an environmentally relevant alternative with very low direct GHG emissions and potentially high GWP reduction. Further research should improve residue post-treatment.",Alkaline recovery of phosphorous from sewage sludge and stabilisation of sewage sludge residue.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30691889,"Waste management (New York, N.Y.)",2019 01 29,"The alkaline leaching of Phosphorous (P) from sewage sludge (SS) using either NaOH or KOH was investigated. The effect of type and concentration of alkali, solid liquid loading and leaching temperature were also investigated. The possibility to stabilise the leached SS residue via geopolymerisation was also explored. The results showed that KOH leached more P than NaOH. The leaching conditions yielding the highest P recovery were 8 M KOH, 4% m/v solid to liquid loading, a leaching time of 2 h and a leaching temperature of 95 °C resulting in a 85% P leached from SS. The leaching kinetics followed modified Jander kinetics with the leaching process at 95 °C being controlled by diffusion of reactants through a porous layer of reaction products, whilst at 80 °C and 70 °C was controlled by diffusion of reactants through a dense layer of reaction products. A 10% replacement of gold mine tailings (GMT) with the leached SS residue yielded a geopolymer which met the minimum requirements for construction materials with regards to ASTM C67/14 and C129/14a. The geopolymer was cured at 100 °C for 5 days yielding a geopolymer with strength of 14.2 MPa and an open porosity of 0.38. The geopolymer also met the minimum statutory requirements for metal leachability. This study presents an opportunity for the increased alkaline recovery of P from SS and the stabilisation of the SS residue thereby creating a no solid waste process.",Thiourea bioleaching for gold recycling from e-waste.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30691888,"Waste management (New York, N.Y.)",2019 01 29,"Recycling and reuse of electronic wastes (e-wastes) are becoming an increasingly critical strategy for securing metal resources as well as for minimizing environmental impacts. Thiourea leaching of gold (Au) from e-wastes can be considered an alternative to highly toxic cyanidation, provided that its reagents consumption can be largely reduced. While awareness of the use of biohydrometallurgical techniques in metal mining industries is increasing, the knowledge on microbiological precious metal solubilization is still limited. This led us to investigate and clarify for the first time the potential utility of microbiologically-mediated thiourea leaching (TU-bioleaching) of Au, with a special focus on reducing the reagents consumption while facilitating Au dissolution. Initial screening tests found that different Fe-oxidizing bacteria/archaea possessed varying degrees of thiourea tolerance (5-100 mM). When thiourea and PCB (Printed Circuit Boards) co-exist, Acidiplasma sp. Fv-Ap displayed the most robust Fe-oxidation. The Eh level during the reaction was first optimized by fluctuating the initial ratio of thiourea to Fe3+ (TU:Fe3+ = 2:1-40:1, by using 1 mM Fe3+ vs. 2-40 mM thiourea). The ratio precisely determined the Eh level during the TU-bioleaching and dictated the fate of thiourea decomposition and the resultant Au dissolution from PCB. Microbial contribution to Fe3+ regeneration was seen to support steady and continuous Au dissolution, enabling 98% Au dissolution while using low reagent concentrations of 1 mM Fe3+ and 10 mM thiourea under the microbial Eh control at around 490-545 mV. This novel TU-bioleaching process offers a new alternative approach for Au recycling from e-wastes and minimization of environmental hazards.",European Countries: Does common legislation guarantee better hazardous waste performance for European Union member states?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30691887,"Waste management (New York, N.Y.)",2019 01 29,"The study of efficiency in hazardous waste management has been proved to be a driving factor for sustainable development (SD). This study focuses on a performance assessment of European countries, most of them European Union (EU) member states and candidate countries that share a common legislative framework through European regulations, in order to provide a general understanding of hazardous waste performance. In this paper, we use Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) to examine the efficiency of 32 countries in Europe by using novel input/output environmental parameters to study the efficiency of the different waste management operations from an environmental point of view. This analysis contrasts the efficiency in the management of total waste versus hazardous waste and studies three operations with hazardous wastes: incineration and incineration with energy recovery, disposal and recovery. Results show that there are differences in the achievement of efficiency, not only among countries, but also among the different waste management operations analysed.",Inactivation of antibiotic resistance genes in antibiotic fermentation residues by ionizing radiation: Exploring the development of recycling economy in antibiotic pharmaceutical factory.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30691886,"Waste management (New York, N.Y.)",2019 01 29,"Antibiotic fermentation residues are a kind of hazardous waste due to the existence of the residual antibiotics and the potential risk to generate antibiotics resistance genes (ARGs). The appropriate treatment and disposal of antibiotic fermentation residues is imperative. In this study ionizing radiation was applied to treat the antibiotic fermentation residues and the removal efficiencies of antibiotic (erythromycin), ARGs (ermB and ermF) and antibiotic resistant bacteria were investigated. The experimental results showed that erythromycin A content in antibiotic fermentation residues decreased by 86% when the dose was 10 kGy. Moreover, the abundance of ermB and ermF reduced by 89% and 98% at 10 kGy irradiation. Over 99% of total bacteria was removed and antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB) were less than detection limit after 10 kGy irradiation. Ionizing radiation process is a promising technology for simultaneously removing antibiotic and inactivating ARGs and ARB in antibiotic fermentation residues. Moreover, the irradiation at 10 kGy had no significant influence on the macromolecules organic matters (protein, polysaccharides) of the antibiotic fermentation residues, suggesting that the treated fermentative residues can be used as fertilizer, which could provide the technical support for the development of recycling economy in antibiotic pharmaceutical factory.",Fate of antibiotics present in a primary sludge of WWTP during their co-composting with palm wastes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30691885,"Waste management (New York, N.Y.)",2019 01 29,"Antibiotics persistence in the primary sludge can contribute to the emergence of these molecules in the environment and limit the agricultural recycling of sludge without any preliminary treatment. Composting is a widely used process for recycling sludges and then can contribute to the antibiotics removal. However, little interest is actually given to the evaluation of the persistence of some antibiotics families after the sludge co-composting and more particularly to the final compost valorization. In this work, antibiotics concentrations of βeta-lactams, Macrolides, Lincosamide, Tetracyclines, Sulfonamides and Fluoroquinolones were checked in the primary sludge of the wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) of Marrakesh (Morocco) before its co-composting. The results showed a final high amount of the fluoroquinolones family (4.21 and 2.92 μg/kg DM for Ciprofloxacin and Ofloxacin respectively) compared to the other studied families. To assess the fate of antibiotics, the primary sludge and palm waste were windrowed and composted during 120 days. The final compost showed a high level of organic matter decomposition (52%) and a C/N ratio of 12 which insure the compost quality. The assessment of antibiotics concentrations during co-composting showed that clarithromycin is more degraded particularly during the stabilization stage (43%), the degradation of lincomycin and tetracyclines is more significant during the maturation stage (36 and 75% respectively). Ampicillin and trimethoprim were degraded all along the process of co-composting (46 and 35% respectively). By the way, the persistence of the fluoroquinolones family was observed. This persistence could be a limiting key factor for the composted sludge valorization. So, more knowledge is needed to understand fluoroquinolones behavior and, then, to optimize their composting conditions.",Time-lagged effects of weekly climatic and socio-economic factors on ANN municipal yard waste prediction models.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30691884,"Waste management (New York, N.Y.)",2019 01 29,"Efficient and effective solid waste management requires sufficient ability to predict the operational capacity of a system correctly. Waste prediction models have been widely studied and these models are always being challenged to perform more accurately.

This study is the first to specifically look at lag times relating to variables that attempt to predict municipal yard waste generation using machine learning approaches. Weekly averaged climatic and socio-economic variables are screened through correlation analysis and the significant variables are then used to develop yard waste models. These models then utilize artificial neural networks (ANN) where the variables are time lagged for a different number of weeks. This helps to realize a reduction in the error of the predicted weekly yard waste generation. Optimal lag times for each model varied from 1 to 11 weeks. The best model used both the ambient air temperature and population variables, in an ANN model with 3 layers, 11 neurons in the hidden layer, and an optimal lag time of 1 week. A mean absolute percentage error of 18.72% was obtained during the testing stage. One model saw a 55.4% decrease in the mean squared error at training, showing the value of lag time on the accuracy of weekly yard waste prediction models.",Quantitative evaluation of heavy metals' pollution hazards and estimation of heavy metals' environmental costs in leachate during food waste composting.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30691883,"Waste management (New York, N.Y.)",2019 01 29,"Heavy metals in leachate during food waste composting may produce different degrees of pollution hazards and further induce environment costs, when the concentrations of heavy metals exceed the discharging quality standards. Quantitative evaluation of heavy metals' pollution hazards and estimation of such environmental costs are under-represented in the existing literature. This paper uses a logistic function approach to evaluate the extent of pollution hazards of heavy metals such as cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr), mercury (Hg), lead (Pb) and arsenic (As) and to estimate heavy metals' environmental costs in leachate during food waste composting from Minhang food waste treatment plant located in northern Shanghai, China. Major findings of this study are: (1) The pollution hazards rate of Cd amounts to 94.03%, probably because Cd-containing materials such as plastics are mixed with food waste; (2) With the comprehensive pollution hazards rate estimated as 94.48%, the environmental costs caused by heavy metals in leachate during food waste composting amount to US$0.52 per tonne. This magnitude of environmental costs is meaningful and significant, considering that it is equivalent to 2.97% of Shanghai's food waste treatment charges.",Study on the evolution and transformation of Cl during Co-incineration of a mixture of rectification residue and raw meal of a cement kiln.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30691882,"Waste management (New York, N.Y.)",2019 01 29,"The co-processing of hazardous waste in cement kiln can eliminate a large number of hazardous wastes, but the excessive existence of chlorine will affect normal operation of cement kiln. In this study, the partition of Cl in flue gas, fly ash and residual solid under different experiment conditions was obtained by using tubular furnace to incinerate mixtures of rectification residue and raw meal. The chlorine content in flue gas was determined using ion chromatography and the chlorine content in fly ash and residual solid was measured by high temperature combustion hydrolyzing-ion chromatography. The results showed that chlorine mainly existed in flue gas and residual solid, and only less than 3.5% of chlorine existed in fly ash. The incineration temperature had a significant effect on the distribution of chlorine in each part. The higher the incinerating temperature, the greater the proportion of chlorine in flue gas and fly ash. While temperatures were higher than 1300 °C, the proportion of chlorine in all parts remained basically unchanged, roughly 18:14:1. With the increase of the retention time, the proportion of chlorine in the residual solid decreased gradually, and the proportion of chlorine in the flue gas increased gradually. The distribution ratio of chlorine in each part remained unchanged after about 30 min. In addition, the chlorine content of the sample and the air flow rate had a relatively slight effect on the partition of chlorine. Based on these experimental results, some suggestions on the co-processing of hazardous waste in cement kiln were put forward."

In this review we discuss the current knowledge about the fate of mtDNA following double-strand breaks, including the molecular players which mediate the degradation of linear mtDNA fragments and possible mechanisms of recircularization.

This paper numerically investigates the impact of surfactant partitioning on the enhanced NAPL dissolution and mobilization mechanisms and the overall NAPL removal from the subsurface. For demonstration, a multiphase model is used to simulate a hypothetical SEAR consisting of Triton X100 surfactant solution for the removal of perchloroethylene (PCE) entrapped in contaminated porous medium at the core/column scale. The simulations are conducted for two-dimensional homogenous and three-dimensional heterogeneous systems. By simultaneously incorporating spatial heterogeneity of porous media, injection rate, and endpoint mobility ratio into the model, we delineate the interplay of surfactant partitioning with flow and transport dynamics. Our results show that surfactant partitioning from the aqueous phase across the interface to the NAPL phase can undermine both efficiency of the enhanced dissolution and mobilization of NAPL species. This undermining is more pronounced for when aqueous phase mobility is less than the mobility of the NAPL phase. For such conditions interfacial tension between the two phases is reduced less for partitioning than non-partitioning cases (due to loss of surfactant into NAPL phase) and a secondary water front is formed due to partitioning that makes aqueous phase breaks through earlier.",miR-495 promotes apoptosis and inhibits proliferation in endometrial cells via targeting PIK3R1.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30691859,"Pathology, research and practice",2019 04 10,"Endometrial cancer (EC) is a huge threat to women's health. The aims of this study were to investigate the role of microRNA (miR)-495 in the proliferation and apoptosis of EC cells in vitro. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was performed to detect the mRNA levels. In addition, dual-luciferase reporter assay was used to verified that PIK3R1 was a target of miR-495. After transfection with miR-495 mimics, Cell Counting Kit 8 (CCK-8) assay was performed to evaluate the cell viability of EC cells. The protein expression of PIK3R1, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), Bcl-2, Bax, caspase 3 after transfection was analyzed using western blotting. Furthermore, cell apoptosis rate of EC cells was evaluated by flow cytometry. These results showed that miR-495 was significantly down-regulated in tumor tissues compared with the adjacent normal tissues, while PIK3R1 was up-regulated. The proliferation of the EC cells that were transfected with miR-495 mimics was markedly inhibited, and apoptosis was significantly promoted. In addition, downregulated expression of PIK3R1, Bcl-2, VEGF expression and upregulated expression of Bax and caspase 3 expression were observed after transfected with miR-495 mimic.

A convenience sample of 44 patients with TTH participated in this randomized clinical trial. The frequency and intensity of headache, pressure pain threshold at the trigger point site, and cervical range of motion were recorded. Then the participants were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups for dry needling or friction massage, delivered in 3 sessions during 1 week. The participants were evaluated 48 h after the last treatment session. Analysis of covariance, paired t-test and Wilcoxon's test were used for statistical analysis. The results showed that both treatment methods significantly reduced headache frequency and intensity, and increased pain threshold at the trigger points. However, neither treatment had any effect on cervical range of motion except for extension, which increased in the dry needling group. Between-group comparisons showed that dry needling increased pain threshold significantly more than friction massage.

The purpose of this study was to comprehend how ambulatory people with stroke, naïve to the use of canes, perceive using a cane during walking. An exploratory, qualitative study was conducted. Twenty-four people, on average 6 years after a stroke, were included. Participants were categorized as slow (<0.4 m/s), intermediate (0.4-0.8 m/s), or fast walkers (>0.8 m/s), based on their baseline walking speed. Participants' spontaneous perceptions regarding the use of a cane were collected during a timed-walk test and analyzed, following standardized recommendations. The discourse of each participant was categorized into ""positive perceptions"" or ""negative perceptions"". Overall, the nature of the perceptions was both positive (i.e., improvements of mobility and/or independence, and improvement of safety/balance and/or reduced risk of falls) and negative (i.e., social stigmatisms, and interference with use of the non-paretic upper limb). However, participants' perceptions were diverse, depending on their walking ability. Participants categorized as slow walkers perceived the use of a cane as positive, but this positive perception decreased, as walking ability increased. The most positive perceptions came from individuals with severe and moderate walking limitations, who tended to believe that using a cane may be helpful for improving walking, safety, and promoting independence. Fast walkers provided negative perceptions, and may not choose to use canes for walking due to social stigmatisms or interference with use of the non-paretic upper limb.",The effect of aerobic exercises among women with mild and moderate irritable bowel syndrome: A pilot study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30691746,Journal of bodywork and movement therapies,2019 06 13,"Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) is a functional bowel disorder characterized by abdominal pain or discomfort.

In contrast, human postnatal TE trachea, formed small epithelial lumens with rare differentiation, in addition to smooth muscle and cartilage. Human fetal TELT contained the largest epithelial lumens with all differentiated cell types as well as smooth muscle and cartilage. Increased epithelial cytokeratin 14 was identified in both human fetal and postnatal TELT compared to native trachea, consistent with regenerative basal cells. Cilia in TELT epithelium also demonstrated function with beating movements. While both human postnatal and fetal progenitors have the potential to generate TELT, there is more epithelial growth and differentiation from fetal progenitors, highlighting fundamental differences in these cell populations.",An overview of obstetric hemorrhage.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30691692,Seminars in perinatology,2019 04 30,"Obstetric hemorrhage is the leading cause of maternal morbidity and mortality in the world.

The considerable variability in its clinical expression, the difficulties in diagnosing the condition and the current availability of several alternatives for its treatment represent a considerable challenge that justifies the development of evidence-based clinical practice guidelines that can help health professionals in the decision-making process for managing these patients. To develop these guidelines, we conducted a systematic search of the main reference databases using strategies adapted to each of the 32 clinical questions considered. We prepared documents to synthesise the evidence and assess its quality for each of the questions. The methodology employed is based on the Spanish methodology manual for preparing clinical practice guidelines, incorporating the GRADE methodology in the assessment of the scientific evidence and the preparation of the recommendations, considering the quality of the evidence, the risk-benefit balance, patient values and preferences, equity and use of resources. For the definitive preparation of the recommendations, we conducted a structured consensus process based on the Delphi-RAND methodology in 2 rounds, with an expert panel proposed by various scientific societies, research centres and patient associations.

This phenomenon has been observed in populations across the globe and, while virtually non-existent in children is estimated to affect >10% of the 70-and-older age group. The mutations are thought to occur in stem cells, which makes them pre-cancerous, and precursors to cancer stem cells. Many of the genes most commonly mutated in clonal hematopoiesis are also recurrently mutated in leukemia, genes such as DNMT3A, TET2, ASXL1, JAK2, and TP53. However, between 40% and 60% of cases arise from the accumulation of what appear to be random mutations outside of known driver genes. Clonal hematopoiesis is frequently present in otherwise healthy individuals and may persist for many years. Though largely asymptomatic, carrying these somatic mutations confers a small but significantly increased risk of leukemic transformation, affecting 0.5-1% carriers per year; although most genes confer an increased risk of transformation, mutations in TP53 and U2AF1 appear to carry a particularly high risk for transformation. Additionally, a patient's history of prior treatment with cytotoxic chemotherapy and/or radiation are correlated with the development of clonal hematopoiesis; in the setting of chemotherapy treatment of solid tumors, hematopoietic mutations in TP53 and PPM1D appear to contribute to outgrowth of clones that may lead to subsequent malignancy. The presence of a clone also imparts a significantly increased risk of cardiovascular disease, which in some cases appears to be due to increased inflammation and atherosclerosis. Clonal hematopoiesis is correlated with several other diseases as well, including diabetes, chronic pulmonary disease, and aplastic anemia, with other associations probably yet to be uncovered.",Hypoxia-inducible factors promote breast cancer stem cell specification and maintenance in response to hypoxia or cytotoxic chemotherapy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30691683,Advances in cancer research,2019 01 29,"Clinical studies have revealed that breast cancers contain regions of intratumoral hypoxia (reduced oxygen availability), which activates hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs). The relationship between intratumoral hypoxia, distant metastasis and cancer mortality has been well established. A major mechanism by which intratumoral hypoxia contributes to disease progression is through induction of the breast cancer stem cell (BCSC) phenotype. BCSCs are a small subpopulation of cells with the capability for self-renewal. BCSCs have been implicated in resistance to chemotherapy, disease recurrence, and metastasis. In this review, we will discuss our current understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying HIF-dependent induction of the BCSC phenotype in response to hypoxia or chemotherapy.",Assays for functionally defined normal and malignant mammary stem cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30691682,Advances in cancer research,2019 01 29,"The discovery of rare, heterogeneous self-renewing stem cells with shared developmental and molecular features within epithelial components of mammary gland and breast cancers has provided a conceptual framework to understand cellular composition of these tissues and mechanisms that control their number.

""Next-generation"" methods using ""barcoded"" normal and malignant mammary cells, with the help of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology, have revealed hidden complexity and heterogeneous growth potential of MaSCs and BCSCs.

The PSEDN is comprised of four conserved protein families; including paired box (PAX), sine oculis (SIX), eyes absent (EYA), and dachshund (DACH). Aberrant expression of PSEDN members, particularly SIX1, has been observed in multiple human cancers, where SIX1 expression correlates with increased aggressiveness and poor prognosis. In conjunction with its transcriptional activator EYA, the SIX1 transcription factor increases cancer stem cell (CSC) numbers and induces epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). SIX1 promotes multiple hallmarks and enabling characteristics of cancer via regulation of cell proliferation, senescence, apoptosis, genome stability, and energy metabolism. SIX1 also influences the tumor microenvironment, enhancing recruitment of tumor-associated macrophages and stimulating angiogenesis, to promote tumor development and progression. EYA proteins are multifunctional, possessing a transcriptional activation domain and tyrosine phosphatase activity, that each contributes to cancer stem cell properties. DACH proteins function as tumor suppressors in solid cancers, opposing the actions of SIX-EYA and reducing CSC prevalence. Multiple mechanisms can lead to increased SIX1 expression, including loss of SIX1-targeting tumor suppressor microRNAs (miRs), whose expression correlates inversely with SIX1 expression in cancer patient samples. In this review, we discuss the major mechanisms by which SIX1 confers CSC and EMT features and other important cancer cell characteristics. The roles of EYA and DACH in CSCs and cancer progression are briefly highlighted. Finally, we summarize the clinical significance of SIX1 in cancer to emphasize the potential therapeutic benefits of effective strategies to disrupt PSEDN protein interactions and functions.",[Are abdominal aortic aneurysm screening guidelines followed?

These immune systems are based on highly specific nucleases that bind DNA or RNA and, upon sequence recognition, degrade the bound nucleic acid. Because of their specificity, CRISPR-Cas systems are being co-opted to edit genes in eukaryotic cells. While the general function of these systems is well understood, an understanding of mechanistic details to facilitate engineering and application to this new arena remains a topic of intense study. Here, we present two methods that have been successfully used to study the structure and mechanism of the Type IE CRISPR system, Cascade, from Escherichia coli. We provide the protocol for a typical native mass spectrometry experiment which, because it allows for analysis of a protein complex without disruption of the noncovalent interactions within the complex, can be used to determine complex composition, architecture, and relative affinity between subunits. We, also, provide the protocol for intact protein hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry, which provides insight into the overall conformational stability of the complex and changes in complex stability based on conditions such as substrate binding. Investigating the solution-phase structure, stability, and dynamics of these complexes improves the overall understanding of the mechanism facilitating engineered adjustments to function or utility.",Sortase-mediated fluorescent labeling of CRISPR complexes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30691654,Methods in enzymology,2019 05 22,"Fluorescent labeling of proteins is a critical requirement for single-molecule imaging studies. Many protein labeling strategies require harsh conditions or large epitopes that can inactivate the target protein, either by decreasing the protein's enzymatic activity or by blocking protein-protein interactions. Here, we provide a detailed protocol to efficiently label CRISPR-Cas complexes with a small fluorescent peptide via sortase-mediated transpeptidation. The sortase tag consists of just a few amino acids that are specifically recognized at either the N- or the C-terminus, making this strategy advantageous when the protein is part of a larger complex. Sortase is active at high ionic strength, 4°C, and with a broad range of organic fluorophores. We discuss the design, optimization, and single-molecule fluorescent imaging of CRISPR-Cas complexes on DNA curtains.

Acquisition is facilitated by the almost universally conserved proteins Cas1 and Cas2, which form an adaptation complex.

Structural and biochemical studies from reconstituted complexes have provided mechanistic insight into how CRISPR adaptation occurs; however, these studies have been limited to a narrow subset of CRISPR-Cas types and may not be representative of the other types. Here we describe methods for the purification of the type I-F CRISPR adaptation complex (Cas1:Cas2-3) from Pectobacterium atrosepticum, purification of the DNA architectural protein integration host factor (IHF), and a sensitive PCR-based in vitro integration assay.

They attach to a specific host, inject their DNA, hijack the host's cellular processes, and replicate exponentially while destroying the host. Historically, phages have been exploited as powerful antimicrobials, and phage-derived proteins have constituted the basis for numerous biotechnological applications. Only in recent years have metagenomic studies revealed that phage genomes harbor a rich reservoir of genetic diversity, which might afford further therapeutic and/or biotechnological value. Nevertheless, functions for the majority of phage genes remain unknown, and due to their swift and destructive replication cycle, many phages are intractable by current genetic engineering techniques. Whether to advance the basic understanding of phage biology or to tap into their potential applications, efficient methods for phage genetic engineering are needed. Recent reports have shown that CRISPR-Cas systems, a class of prokaryotic immune systems that protect against phage infection, can be harnessed to engineer diverse phages. In this chapter, we describe methods to genetically manipulate virulent phages using CRISPR-Cas10, a Type III-A CRISPR-Cas system native to Staphylococcus epidermidis. A method for engineering phages that infect a CRISPR-less Staphylococcus aureus host is also described. Both approaches have proved successful in isolating desired phage mutants with 100% efficiency, demonstrating that CRISPR-Cas10 constitutes a powerful tool for phage genetic engineering. The relatively widespread presence of Type III CRISPR-Cas systems in bacteria and archaea imply that similar strategies may be used to manipulate the genomes of diverse prokaryotic viruses."

Genotypic variations in carbon isotope composition (δ13C), carbon isotope discrimination (Δ13C), ratio of intercellular to atmospheric CO2 concentration (Ci/Ca), intrinsic water use efficiency (iWUE), seed yield and grain protein contents were analyzed in 6 quinoa cultivars grown in the field under saline conditions (0, 10, 20 dS m-1). Significant variations occurred in dry biomass, seed yield, plant height, number of branches, number of panicles, panicle weight, harvest index, N and C content. Some genotypes produced yields with values significantly higher than 2.04 t ha-1 (Q12), with an average increased to 2.58 t ha-1 (AMES22157). The present study indicates a large variation in Δ13C for salinity treatments (3.43‰) and small magnitude of variations among genotypes (0.95‰). Results showed that Δ might be used as an important index for screening, and selection of the salt tolerant quinoa genotypes with high iWUE. Quinoa genotypes differs in foliar 13C and 15N isotope composition, which reflected complex interactions of salinity and plant carbon and nitrogen metabolisms. Grain protein contents were found higher in Q19 and Q31 and lowest in Q26. The study demonstrates that AMES22157 and Q12, were salt tolerant and high yielder while the AMES22157 was more productive. This study provides a reliable measure of morpho-physiological, biochemical and isotopic responses of quinoa cultivars to salinity in hyper arid UAE climate and it may be valuable in the future breeding programs.

Here, the isolation and characterization of HCTs encoded by the two liverwort species, Plagiochasma appendiculatum and Marchantia paleacea, are described. The sequences of the two enzymes harbor features typical of BAHD family members, except for the presence of a stretch of >100 residues that are not represented in higher plant HCTs. When truncated versions of both genes, which were constructed to clarify the significance of these extra residues, were investigated, it became apparent that the full-length and the truncated gene products shared similar catalytic activity and recognized the same substrates in vitro. They also functioned equivalently in vivo either when transiently expressed in tobacco to cause a higher total production of CGA (5-CQA) and 4-CQA or stably expressed in liverworts to accumulate the lignin-like contents. A structural model of MpHCT suggests that its active site bind to its substrate similar to that of Arabidopsis thaliana HCT.

In this study, SSTR2 expression was evaluated in 46 canine meningiomas; in 21 cases this was by immunohistochemistry and in 25 cases by reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). In addition, SSTR2 expression was evaluated by immunocytochemistry, western blotting and RT-qPCR on primary cell cultures prepared from two canine meningiomas. SSTR2 immunohistochemical expression was observed in 17/21 cases (81%), and SSTR2 mRNA expression was detected in 14/25 cases (56%). SSTR2 protein and gene expression were not significantly correlated with the tumour histological subtype or grade. Overall, meningothelial meningiomas showed constant and diffuse SSTR2 immunohistochemical expression and the highest SSTR2 gene expression level compared with other subtypes. A tendency for loss of SSTR2 in high-grade meningiomas was observed in both immunohistochemical and RT-qPCR studies. About 90% of cultured canine meningioma cells showed SSTR2 expression. In both of the meningioma cell cultures, SSTR2 expression was also detected by western blotting and RT-qPCR. This study demonstrates for the first time that canine meningioma expresses SSTR2 and that this expression is maintained in vitro. Our results, while preliminary, provide encouragement for further studies aimed at finding novel medical treatment strategies for canine meningioma, especially for tumours that are not surgically accessible.",Immunohistochemical Profile of Ameloblastic Carcinoma Arising from an Amyloid-Producing Odontogenic Tumour in a Miniature Dachshund.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30691607,Journal of comparative pathology,2019 05 14,"A 13-year-old female miniature dachshund was presented with a centrally-located sublingual mass in the rostral mandibular region. The focally ulcerated growth completely covered the left (305) and right (405) premolar teeth and partially covered the right canine teeth (404). A punch biopsy sample revealed neoplastic proliferation of odontogenic epithelium arranged in irregular cords with frequent comedo-like necrosis. Following the initial diagnosis of ameloblastic carcinoma, a bilateral rostral hemimandibulectomy was performed. Although the detailed examination of the resected mass was consistent with the initial diagnosis, it also contained birefringent congophilic, amelogenin-labelled amyloid deposits similar to an amyloid-producing odontogenic tumour (APOT) in 30-40% of the mass, in continuity with the ameloblastic carcinoma. All neoplastic cells had diffuse moderate expression of cytokeratin (CK) AE1/AE3 and CK5, diffuse mild expression of CK14 and multifocal moderate expression of CK19. Because the APOT-like growth in the mass was histologically benign, the tumour was diagnosed as an ameloblastic carcinoma arising from an APOT.",Chronic Basophilic Leukaemia in a Dog.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30691606,Journal of comparative pathology,2019 05 14,"A 13-year-old neutered female mixed-breed dog with a clinical history of emaciation, inappetence and vomiting for 2 months was presented. Blood tests showed marked leucocytosis with increased neutrophil and basophil count, mild thrombocytosis and anaemia. Seven days after the initial visit, the dog died and was submitted for necropsy examination. Grossly, the bone marrow was red in colour and hepatomegaly and splenomegaly with discolouration were observed. A bone marrow smear showed an increased proportion of basophilic lineage cells. Histologically, the bone marrow showed high cellular density and numerous basophilic lineage cells with a round or segmented nucleus. The cytoplasm contained basophilic granules exhibiting metachromasia on toluidine blue staining. Immunohistochemically, the neoplastic basophils were diffusely positive for vimentin and myeloperoxidase, but negative for CD3, BLA36, CD163, CD204 and c-kit. The immunohistochemical features of neoplastic basophils that had invaded the liver and spleen were similar to those of the basophils in the bone marrow. Based on the clinicopathological and histopathological findings, chronic basophilic leukaemia was diagnosed. The present case study provides insights into the pathological features of chronic basophilic leukaemia in dogs.",A Descriptive Study of Lectin Histochemistry of the Placenta in Cattle following Inoculation of Neospora caninum.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30691605,Journal of comparative pathology,2019 05 14,"The aim of this study was to describe the lectin-binding pattern in the placentas of cows infected experimentally with Neospora caninum. Four cows were inoculated intravenously with 1 × 108 tachyzoites of the NC-1 strain of N. caninum at 150 ± 7 days of pregnancy. Two control cows were administered a placebo. An indirect fluorescence antibody test (IFAT) was performed on serum samples obtained before and after the inoculation. The cows were killed at 30 and 37 days post inoculation. Samples of placenta were taken for histopathology and lectin histochemistry. Fetal tissues and fluids were collected for histopathology and IFAT, respectively. All infected cows had high antibody titres. All fetuses had characteristic histopathological lesions, including non-suppurative meningoencephalitis, myocarditis, hepatitis and myositis, suggesting N. caninum infection. Only two infected fetuses developed specific antibodies. Mild non-suppurative inflammatory infiltrates were recorded in the placentae. Differences in the lectin-binding pattern were observed between infected animals and controls in the glycocalyx (CON-A and WGA) and apical cytoplasm (RCA-I and CON-A) of the trophoblastic cells; giant trophoblastic cells (CON-A and DBA); glycocalyx (PNA, WGA) and apical cytoplasm (CON-A, WGA, PNA, DBA and RCA-I) of endometrial cells; trophoblast of the interplacentomal region (WGA); endothelium (CON-A, SBA, RCA-1 and WGA); and finally, mesenchyme (CON-A, RCA-1, SBA, PNA and DBA). These findings indicate that there is a distinctive pattern of lectin binding in the placenta of cattle infected with N. caninum. The direct effect of the presence of the protozoa as well as the altered expression of cytokines could explain these changes in the maternofetal interface.",Neoplasia in Captive Panthera Species.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30691604,Journal of comparative pathology,2019 05 14,"This retrospective study identified the spectrum of neoplasia diagnoses, prevalence rates and the contribution of neoplasia to death or humane destruction within Panthera species housed at a large cat sanctuary. Biopsy and necropsy reports from January 2002 to December 2017 were examined and histological material from cases diagnosed with neoplasia was reviewed. One hundred and sixty-eight neoplasms were diagnosed in 108 large felids: 70 tigers (Panthera tigris), 26 lions (Panthera leo), three ligers (P. leo × P. tigris), eight leopards (Panthera pardus) and one jaguar (Panthera onca). Forty-four felids had multiple neoplasms. The overall neoplasia rate (animals with neoplasms/all Panthera spp. pathology accessions) was 50.2%. Neoplasms predominantly originated from the reproductive (n = 47), endocrine (n = 27) and integumentary (n = 24) systems, with mammary carcinoma the most common neoplasm (n = 28). Mammary carcinomas comprised 59.6% of the reproductive tumours diagnosed and commonly metastasized widely. Neoplasia was the cause of death or humane destruction in 50.9% of the animals diagnosed with neoplasms. All lymphomas (n = 16) were responsible for death or humane destruction. This study shows that malignant and benign neoplasms are present in approximately half of ageing, captive Panthera spp., and that half of these animals will die or be humanely destroyed as a result of their neoplasms.",Cerebral and cardiac congenital malformations in neonatal West Indian manatees (Trichechus manatus).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30691603,Journal of comparative pathology,2019 05 14,"Strandings of live new-born West Indian manatees (WIMs; Trichechus manatus) are one of the main challenges for the conservation of this species in Brazil, particularly in the northeastern states. Congenital malformations (CMs) are rare in sirenians. We identified CMs in two of 19 stranded WIMs that were rescued, rehabilitated and subjected to complete pathological examinations in Ceará and Rio Grande do Norte States between 1992 and 2017. In case 1, dilation of the cerebral lateral and fourth ventricles with abundant cerebrospinal fluid (internal hydrocephalus), was diagnosed. Furthermore, this animal developed necrotizing enterocolitis associated with pneumatosis intestinalis and aspiration pneumonia late during rehabilitation. Cardiac malformations in case 2 included: right ventricle hypoplasia with marked stenosis of the tricuspid outflow, high ventricular septal defect, segmental pulmonary artery aneurysm, mitral valve haemocyst and left ventricular hypertrophy. Herein, we provide the first description of a neural tube defect, specifically a developmental internal hydrocephalus, and multiple cardiac congenital anomalies, together with their respective clinicopathological features in manatees. Although the aetiology of the CMs remains unknown in these cases, a genetic basis is plausible given the low genetic variability in this population. These cases add to the body of knowledge on health and disease aspects of manatees and may provide scientific basis for future medical and conservation efforts on neonatal WIMs.",Feline Lymphoma and a High Correlation with Feline Leukaemia Virus Infection in Brazil.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30691602,Journal of comparative pathology,2019 05 14,"Lymphoma is the most important haemopoietic tumour in cats and has been associated with feline leukaemia virus (FeLV) infection. In Brazil, no studies have established a correlation between FeLV infection and lymphoma. The aim of this study was to characterize lymphomas arising in cats in Brazil anatomically and microscopically, and to correlate these data with FeLV infection as determined by immunohistochemistry for the FeLV gp70 antigen. Fifty-three cats with lymphoma were evaluated. The mean age of junior, prime, mature, senior and geriatric cats was 1.65 years, 4.34 years, 8 years, 12.14 years and 15.5 years, respectively. The anatomical types of lymphoma were multicentric (43.4%, 23/53), mediastinal (33.96%, 18/53), renal (11.32%, 6/53), hepatic (5.66%, 3/53), nodal (3.77%, 2/53) and alimentary (1.89 %, 1/53). The histological types were small noncleaved-cell (33.96%, 18/53), mixed diffuse (22.64%, 12/53), immunoblastic (15.11%, 8/53), lymphoblastic (11, 32%, 6/53), small lymphocytic (9.43%, 5/53), small cleaved-cell (3.77%, 2/53) and large cell lymphomas (3.77%, 2/3). Immunopositivity for FeLV was observed in 56.6% (30/53) of the samples. FeLV positivity was equally distributed between the genders, but predominated in junior and prime cats. The degree of association between lymphoma and FeLV infection in Brazil was higher than that found in other countries, demonstrating the need to prevent and control the factors associated with infection.",Pancreatic Choristoma in a Canine Gallbladder.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30691601,Journal of comparative pathology,2019 05 14,"A 1.5-year-old male Siberian Husky dog was presented with a history of progressive twitching and tetraplegia. The dog was humanely destroyed and at necropsy examination an incidental intramural white lesion measuring 10 × 15 × 5 mm was observed in the gallbladder. Histologically, the mass consisted of pancreatic tissue located in the tunica adventitia of the gallbladder. Immunohistochemistry revealed that the islets of Langerhans were positive for insulin, but negative for glucagon. In addition, the dog had non-suppurative meningoencephalitis associated with canine distemper virus infection. The gallbladder lesion was consistent with pancreatic choristoma and is the first case described in a canine gallbladder.",Primary Osteoma Cutis in the Interscapular Region of a Dog.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30691600,Journal of comparative pathology,2019 05 14,"A 9-year-old neutered male Shih Tzu was presented with three contiguous firm nodules in the subcutaneous tissue of the interscapular region. Histopathological examination revealed that the nodules consisted of mature lamellar bone with a Haversian system, with no apparent lesion around the bone. Clinical examination revealed that the dog had no underlying disease and no history of trauma at the lesion site. Based on these findings and on the medical history, a diagnosis of primary osteoma cutis was made. Osteoma cutis is rare in both human and veterinary medicine, and most dogs reported to have secondary osteoma cutis.

Forty-eight weaned piglets (German-Large-White×Land-Race×Piétrain; 50 % female, 50 % male-castrated; body weight 8·5 (sd 0·27) kg) were fed restrictively (450 g/d) a basal maize-soyabean meal-based diet supplemented with varying amounts of ZnSO4.7H2O (analysed dietary Zn: 28·1, 33·6, 38·8, 42·7, 47·5, 58·2, 67·8, 88·0 mg/kg diet) for an experimental period of 8 d. Analyses comprised Zn concentrations in soft tissues. Statistical analyses included regression models and k-means cluster analysis. Jejunum and kidney Zn correlated positively with dietary Zn (P&lt;0·05). Other Zn pools responded in a non-linear fashion by declining (colon, epidermis, spleen) or increasing (mesenteric lymph follicles, thymus, skeletal muscle) below 63·6, 48·0, 47·5, 68·0, 43·0 and 53·1 mg Zn/kg diet, respectively (P&lt;0·01).

Ultrafine particles (UFP) (small size and large surface area/mass ratio) are systemically distributed, induce inflammation and oxidative stress, and have been associated with vascular endothelial dysfunction and arterial vasoconstriction, increasing hypertension risk. Placental stress and alterations in methylation of promoter regions of renin-angiotensin system (RAS)-related elements could be involved in UFP exposure-related programming of hypertension. We investigated whether in utero UFP exposure promotes placental stress by inflammation and oxidative stress, alterations in hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 11b-type 2 (HSD11B2) and programming of RAS-related elements, and result in altered blood pressure in adult offspring. UFP were collected from ambient air using an aerosol concentrator and physicochemically characterized. Pregnant C57BL/6J pun/pun female mice were exposed to collected UFP (400 μg/kg accumulated dose) by intratracheal instillation and compared to control (nonexposed) and sterile H2O (vehicle) exposed mice. Embryo reabsorption and placental stress by measurement of the uterus, placental and fetal weights, dam serum and fetal cortisol, placental HSD11B2 DNA methylation and protein levels, were evaluated.

In most women, it is diagnosed at an advanced stage, which largely explains the poor prognosis of this malignancy. Germline mutations of the genes BRCA1 and BRCA2, which encode proteins essential for the repair of double-strand DNA breaks through homologous recombination, lead to increased cancer predisposition. BRCA mutations are present in approximately 14% of epithelial ovarian cancers. Somatic BRCA mutations have also been described. Current first-line treatment of high-grade epithelial ovarian cancer includes debulking surgery followed by combination chemotherapy, usually carboplatin and paclitaxel. Ovarian cancer is highly sensitive to chemotherapy, in particular to platinum drugs. Most patient will achieve remission with initial chemotherapy, but most will eventually experience disease recurrence. Targeted therapies, including the anti-angiogenic agent bevacizumab and oral poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors, have been recently approved for the treatment of ovarian cancer, based on the results from randomized clinical trials showing significant benefits in terms of progression-free survival, with acceptable tolerability and no detrimental effects on quality of life. Olaparib, the first PARP inhibitor to be granted approval, is currently indicated as maintenance monotherapy in ovarian cancer patients with relapsed disease and mutated BRCA who have achieved a complete or partial response to platinum-based chemotherapy. The analysis of BRCA mutational status has, therefore, also become crucial for therapeutic decisions. Such advances are making personalized treatment of ovarian cancer feasible. Here we briefly review treatments for platinum-sensitive, high-grade serous epithelial ovarian cancer that are currently available in Italy, with a focus on targeted therapies and the relevance of BRCA mutational analysis. Based on the evidence and on current guidelines, we propose strategies for the tailored treatment of patients with relapsed ovarian cancer that take into account BRCA mutational status and the treatment received in the first-line setting."
